   A series of 21 photos of clouds by photographer
Alfred Stieglitz brought $396,000 at auction Monday and a watch
sold for $539,000, both setting records, auction houses said.
   The watch sold to a private collector for the highest price ever
paid for a watch at auction in the United States, said Sotheby's.
The photo sale was a record price for a single lot of photography,
a spokeswoman for Christie's auction house said.
   The watch, with a face measuring 1.4 inches, was made by Swiss
craftsmen and took three years to complete. It was designed and
commissioned in 1927 by James Schulz, who worked for Tiffany's
before opening his own business and who also designed watches for
Cartier.
   ``It was the most complicated watch of its size ever to be
made,'' said Daryn Schnipper, a watch expert for Sotheby's.
   In addition to a standard dial that tells time, the watch face
has four smaller dials. One gives the month, one gives the day of
the week, one registers the date and has a second hand, and another
gives the phases of the moon.
   The previous record for a watch sold at auction was set earlier
this year when a wristwatch went for $275,000.
   Stieglitz' ``Equivalents _ Three Series of Seven Each'' was
bought by an anonymous collector, said Bethe Goldberg, a publicist
for Christie's. The series consists of 21 different black-and-white
photos of clouds, each measuring 3{ by 4{ inches, dating from the
1920s.
   Stieglitz signed the title page of the series, dedicating it to
Alma Wertheim, a patron and friend. The series was sold by the
Wertheim family, Goldberg said.

   A terrorist and a policeman were killed
by a grenade that burst as the terrorist prepared to toss it at a
passing police patrol Monday night, police said.
   They said an accomplice and a second police officer were wounded
in the explosion in El Minuto de Dios, a northwestern suburb of
this capital city of 6 million people.
   Two other bombs exploded late Monday in south and central
Bogota, but no casualties were reported, authorities said.
   One bomb destroyed part of a bank front and neighboring
buildings and the other caused minor damage at the social security
building.
   The latest incidents, following violence late Sunday that
wounded two journalists, apparently came in response to a decision
by the government of President Virgilio Barco to refuse to
negotiate with drug traffickers.
   The government declared war against the drug lords and their
hired killers on Aug. 19 after leading presidential candidate Sen.
Luis Galan was assassinated.
   Since then, at least 237 bombings and bombing attempts have
taken place throughout Colombia, mostly in Bogota, Medellin,
Barranquilla and Cartegena, resulting in the deaths of 33 people.
   Earlier Monday, eight people were killed and 30 injured when a
bus sped off the side of a ravine near Bordo, 340 miles south of
Bogota, police said.
   The bus was traveling north from Ipiales near the border with
Ecuador. Police said the bus apparently was traveling too fast.

   Forty-eight more bodies were recovered
on Monday in Bhagalpur, a remote town in Bihar state hit by
Hindu-Moslem violence, and another person was killed when police
fired at an angry mob, news reports said.
   Since Sunday, 171 people have died in Bhagalpur and in three
villages stretching across a 125-mile swath of Bihar state, one of
the poorest and most violent in India, news media said.
   United News of India said the official death toll in Bhagalpur
stood at 145 since clashes began last Tuesday.
   Press Trust of India put the Bhagalpur toll at 200.
   In a dispatch from the state capital of Patna, UNI quoted Bihar
Home Affairs Commissioner Jiya Lal Arya as saying police fired when
the mob attacked homes. Police rescued at least 150 residents.
   Bhagalpur is on the Ganges River, which is sacred to Hindus. The
town is about 110 miles east of Patna and 220 miles northwest of
Calcutta.
   Some clashes coincided with processions by Hindu militants who
are collecting bricks to build a temple at Ayodhya, in neighboring
Uttar Pradesh state, where Hindus and Moslems lay claim to the same
religious site.

   Ron Ferguson never learned how to salute
or put on a military uniform properly, because the only time he
spent in the Army was after he was arrested as a deserter and
threatened with court-martial.
   Ferguson, who has sued the Army for $5 million, says the whole
mess began when someone ``stole his identity,'' by taking his name
and Social Security number and enlisting.
   The Army admits the arrest was in error, but claims it was
Ferguson's responsibility to clear up the confusion before it got
that far. Ferguson says he notified a recruiter, whose name he
can't remember, several years before the imposter deserted.
   Now Ferguson, 35, of Louisville, is awaiting a judge's ruling in
the case after a non-jury trial earlier this month in U.S. District
Court here. The judge has not indicated when he will rule.
   After Ferguson's arrest in June 1985, he spent two days in the
Jefferson County jail and nine hours at Fort Knox before his wife,
with the assistance of U.S. Rep. Romano Mazzoli's office, got him
released.
   Ferguson said he was frightened when an officer said he was to
be sent to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., for
court-martial.
   ``All this was new to me,'' said Ferguson, who said when he was
told to put on an Army uniform, he didn't know he was supposed to
tuck his pants into his boots. ``And just because I didn't put it
on right, they made me do push-ups.''
   Failing to salute a lieutenant brought more push-ups, he said.
   The calisthenics, along with sleeping on a concrete floor at the
jail for two nights, aggravated a back condition, he said. Besides
physical suffering, Ferguson claims his reputation was damaged and
he suffered emotional distress _ he spent a month in a Louisville
psychiatric hospital this year _ and damage to his credit rating.
   He has had problems with the Internal Revenue Service, the
Social Security Administration, and demands for payment of the
impostor's debts to the Veterans Administration and others, he said.
   He claims he was hospitalized in February because he was
paranoid and cautious of others.
   ``I used to even look at the telephone man and think he was
spying on me,'' he said.
   A man calling himself Ron Ferguson and using Ferguson's Social
Security number joined the Army at Memphis, Tenn., in 1975. He was
sent to South Korea, where he eventually deserted, Ferguson said.
   The non-military Ferguson found out about the impostor in 1981
when the IRS said he had not been paying taxes on military income.
   ``It still puzzles me right now,'' Ferguson said. ``I wonder
why, and of all people, why me. I have enough problems. I don't
need any more problems.''
   People do give the wrong Social Security number occasionally,
either intentionally or by accidentally scrambling the numbers,
said Tony Higdon, the Social Security Administration's district
manager for Louisville and Jefferson County.
   ``The best thing someone can do is check their Social Security
record periodically'' and make sure the annual earnings match the
figures on the income tax return for each year, Higdon said.
   The Army doesn't deny the mix-up caused Ferguson trouble.
   ``There's no question that he had a rough time, spending 48
hours in jail and another day down at Fort Knox,'' said Scott C.
Cox, the assistant U.S. attorney who is handling the Army's case.
   But Cox said the responsibility was Ferguson's.
   ``He's the one who had the potential to be harmed by the
mistaken records, so I think he had an obligation to follow up and
make sure action was taken,'' Cox said.

<HEAD>Voters' Challenge: To Make New York City `Normal'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

   The cab drivers will still be surly. The Statue
of Liberty will still light the harbor. The Bronx will still be up,
the Battery down, and the folks will still ride in a hole in the
ground.
   But New York is on the edge of a momentous change _ one that
will alter the way the nation's largest city is governed.
   In a referendum that has drawn little attention in the midst of
a tumultuous mayoral campaign, city voters this Nov. 7 will have an
opportunity to approve or reject a charter that would strengthen
the mayor and City Council while wiping out an entire governing
body, the Board of Estimate.
   The board is arguably the most powerful segment of New York
City's government, with final say over the budget. But the U.S.
Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional, so the city
must change.
   ``I think one of the things we're doing is making New York City
like normal governments in America,'' said Frederick A.O. Schwarz
Jr., chairman of the commission that came up with the new, 393-page
city charter.
   That means forming a bigger City Council, changing the mayor's
duties and responsibilities and creating new ways to award
contracts, approve the budget and myriad other procedures.
   Polls indicate the new charter will pass easily, despite
considerable if disjointed opposition.
   The Board of Estimate dates back to 1901. It reflected a new New
York: In 1898, Staten Island, the city of Brooklyn and what is now
Queens joined Manhattan and the Bronx to become one consolidated
city.
   Each of those five boroughs has a president, and those
presidents sit on the Board of Estimate, along with the three
officials elected citywide: the mayor, comptroller and City Council
president.
   For 89 years, the board has been approving contracts, deciding
most land-use questions and approving the annual budget. The
citywide officials have two votes each, while each borough
president has one.
   So Staten Island, with 350,000 residents, has the same voice as
Brooklyn, with 2.2 million. That, the Supreme Court ruled last
March, violated the principle of one-person, one-vote.
   The new plan is updated to suit a changing New York, where
minorities account for more than half the population but only 25
percent of the council is black or Hispanic.
   ``We paid a lot of attention to making sure that minorities had
fair representation,'' Schwarz said.
   The City Council would be expanded from 35 to 51 members under
the new plan, and the smaller districts are expected to produce
more minority members, perhaps as many as 20, or 40 percent of the
council.
   With the Board of Estimate dissolved, the council will become a
true legislature, with final say on the budget and most land use
and zoning questions.
   The mayor will continue running executive agencies, appointing
commissioners, proposing the city budget and estimating revenues _
a crucial element in spending debates.
   ``What the city's doing is moving from a unique, screwball form
of government to one that looks a lot more like what other cities
do _ that's a strong mayor, strong council form of government,''
said Gene Russianoff, attorney for the New York Public Interest
Research Group.
   Supporters say the larger council and new requirements for
public disclosure and a new independent budget office will check
the mayor's power.
   But without the Board of Estimate, critics contend, the mayor
will be too powerful _ ``We will have an imperial mayor,'' said
Ralph J. Lamberti, borough president of Staten Island.
   Lamberti and his fellow borough presidents stand to lose the
most power under the plan, and are among its most outspoken
opponents. The other opponents come from a variety of sources that
don't necessarily have much else in common.
   ``There's the far left and the far right and we're sort of the
center,'' Schwarz said. ``These people are utterly strange
bedfellows. They couldn't possibly come up with a solution.''
   Most city residents seem only vaguely aware of the proposed
changes, which aren't, after all, going to revolutionize life in
New York.
   The average resident, Schwarz said, ``is going to find
government more responsive, and that will be a plus. But will it
pave the streets with gold? No.''

   Investigators found a trail
leading to Malta as the likely source of the bomb that blew up Pan
Am Flight 103 over Scotland, killing 270 people, prosecutor's
spokesman Jochen Schroers said Monday.
   Authorities said a Libyan man may have played a role in the Dec.
21 bombing.
   Schroers, of the prosecutor's office, said a suitcase coming
from Malta aboard an Air Malta flight was the ``presumed''
container for the bomb.
   The suitcase was put aboard the Air Malta flight on the tiny
Mediterranean island nation before being transferred to the Pan Am
flight at its originating point in Frankfurt, officials reported.
   Other evidence recently uncovered by investigators in Europe
adds to suspicion that the bombing was carried out by the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, The New York
Times reported in its Tuesday editions.
   Sixteen members of the Palestinian group were arrested in raids
in West Germany in October 1988 and a bomb similar to the one
believed to have destroyed the plane was seized in that
investigation. U.S. officials told The Times that Mohammed Abu
Talb, a Palestinian now being held on terrorism charges in Sweden,
has told investigators he retrieved one bomb overlooked in the
raids, and passed it to another person.
   Officials declined to identify to whom Talb said he passed the
bomb. But they also said Talb was spotted in Malta in October 1988
in the company of Hafez Dalkamoni, a suspected leader of the
Palestinian group who was arrested in the West German raids later
that month.
   London's Sunday Times first disclosed the evidence of a possible
Maltese connection. It said the bomb was placed in a suitcase
containing clothing made and purchased in Malta.
   Citing British sources, the newspaper said the baggage list
showed one suitcase was transferred to Flight 103 from Air Malta
Flight KM180, which originated in Malta on the morning of Dec. 21.
   No passenger accompanied the bag on the Pan Am flight, it said.
   All 259 people on the jumbo jet and 11 residents of Lockerbie,
Scotland, died as a result of the Dec. 21 bombing.
   In a statement sent by fascimile machine to news media, Schroers
said West German investigators earlier informed Scottish
investigators about suspicions regarding Malta.
   ``The suspicions were made more concrete, when the Scottish
officials informed the Germans that clothing made in Malta was in
the presumed bomb suitcase,'' the statement said.
   It said passengers on the Air Malta flight were not under
suspicion.
   The statement denied British news media reports of friction
between West German and British investigators.
   Schroers said earlier in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press that West German investigators ``are in Malta, but
the Scottish officials are taking the lead.''
   ``It was possibly a man of Libyan extraction, but we can't say
more than that,'' Schroers said of the person who investigators
believe bought the clothes that were in the suitcase.
   ``The investigation into this lead has not been completed.''
   Previous reports said the bomb was placed on board in luggage
checked in at Frankfurt. West German investigators repeatedly
denied any evidence existed to substantiate those claims.
   Pan Am Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, taking on passengers
and luggage flown in from other areas on international ``feeder
flights.'' Passengers and bags were transferred to the doomed
Boeing 747 at Heathrow Airport in London.
   Willi Fundermann, a spokesman for the federal criminal
investigations office in Wiesbaden, said investigators have a ``hot
trail'' leading to Malta.
   ``There are clues that a suitcase from Malta may have played a
part,'' said Fundermann.
   ``There are also clues that someone from Libya _ or at least
someone with a Libyan accent _ may have bought the items.''
   The Flight 103 bomb was packed into a Toshiba radiocassette
player, investigators have said.
   Malta, about 180 miles north of Libya, enjoys good relations
with the government of radical leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi in
Tripoli.
   In Scotland, the chief investigator and head of the judiciary
both refused Monday to disclose any details of the hunt for the
bomber.
   George Esson, chief constable of Dumfries and Galloway who is
leading the international investigation, issued a statement saying
investigators are pursuing a number of ``encouraging lines of
inquiry'' in a number of countries.
   Lord Fraser, Scotland's Lord Advocate and its top judicial
officer, said in a separate statement that ``the investigation
continues to make encouraging progress.'' He said he feared that
premature disclosure of the progress of the investigation ``could
cause grave prejudice to the investigation itself.''
   Esson said: ``Since the outset of this inquiry there has been a
close liaison between the Scottish police, the FBI and the BKA.
Information exchanged at regular meetings between these three
agencies has contributed greatly to the ongoing and very active
criminal investigation.''

   Stone-throwing mobs, blackened hulls of
burned shops and the smell of gunpowder and smoldering ashes evoke
dreaded memories of the bloodiest chapter in modern India's history.
   Town after town in northern India is erupting in religious
rioting.
   Even the former princely state of Rajasthan has become a victim
of the frenzy and hatred it escaped during the birth of Hindu India
and Moslem Pakistan in the 1947 partition when an estimated 1
million people were killed.
   Hindu-Moslem riots and violence have claimed about 200 lives in
the past six weeks. Against that backdrop, with Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's government and the opposition blaming each other for
the renewed violence, next month's parliamentary elections could be
the most divisive and violent in India's 42 years of independence.
   ``The situation is so bad there might be a bloodbath before the
elections. I feel it is the worst since independence,'' said
Indrajit Gupta, deputy secretary-general of the Communist Party of
India.
   Nationwide, the communal caldron is on high boil. More than 500
people have died this year in sectarian violence in the Hindu
heartland states _ Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh,
Gujarat and Maharashtra _ more than double the number killed in the
three previous years.
   ``Even for those of us who lived through the partition, there is
no reason for this poison pill,'' said Shabir Mohammad Shah, a
63-year-old Moslem shopkeeper in Jaipur, the picturesque ``Pink
City'' of Rajasthan.
   ``People now have blood on their hands, hatred in their eyes,
revenge in their hearts, and their souls are ruled by rumors,'' he
said.
   As the election draws closer, one right-wing opposition party is
offering a different vision and fanning the communal flames.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party, or Indian People's Party and called
BJP, has revived the idea of a Hindu India, attacking the secular
base on which modern India was created. It sees a groundswell of
public support in this Hindu-dominated country _ particularly in
northern India which has almost half the 542 seats at stake in the
voting on Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   The BJP contends Hindus have been discriminated against because
of secularist policies dating back to Jawaharlal Nehru, India's
first prime minister and the current prime minister's grandfather,
while minorities and particularly the Moslems have been pampered.
   The BJP is not a major party but the main centrist opposition
party, the Janata Dal, or People's Party, has agreed to share seats
with it in the north, largely because it sees no other way to
defeat Gandhi and his Congress Party.
   ``The obsession with vote banks seems to have driven out all
rational thought,'' the conservative Times of India newspaper said
in an editorial.
   ``It's heads I win, tails you lose because brave words
notwithstanding, the peril of communal animosity is still not taken
seriously. It is all a game in which there is no prize beyond
votes,'' the editorial said.
   India's religious and ethnic mosaic has been inhospitable to a
Hindu party until now.
   Although Hindus comprise more than 80 percent of the population,
they have long been divided along caste and class lines. Except in
times of danger, they rarely vote as a bloc.
   Moslems, on the other hand, make up just 11 percent of India's
880 million people but often wield pivotal electoral influence. Yet
they number more than 100 million, giving India the world's biggest
Moslem population after Indonesia.
   Moslems traditionally have tended to vote as a bloc, making up
more than 20 percent of the electorate in about 100 constituencies.
But now the quest is for a new vote bloc, a consolidated Hindu vote
cutting across caste lines.
   ``Never before have Hindus voted en bloc, and hence all
political parties have ignored them, vitally affecting their
interests,'' said Vishnu Hari Dalmia, president of the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad, or the World Hindu Conference, a fundamentalist
organization and a staunch BJP ally.
   ``The fundamental issue today is whether minorities are going to
enjoy the status of a privileged class or are treated on par with
their Hindu counterparts,'' Dalmia said. ``Thanks to the
appeasement politics of the Congress toward minorities for the last
four decades today a Hindu in his own country is a second-class
citizen.''
   There are other undercurrents, but the primary reason for the
sharpened hostility among Hindus and Moslems is the revival of a
dispute over Babri Masjid, a mosque in Uttar Pradesh that is
believed built on the site of a demolished Hindu temple.
   The disputed site was locked in 1949. Neither Hindus nor Moslems
could pray there until 1986 when a judge ordered the building
unlocked for worship. The issue became a rallying cry for militant
Hindu organizations that revived the call for building a temple and
set Nov. 9 for the foundation-laying ceremony.

   About 25,000 people attended a memorial
service Monday night for 22 workers who died in a series of
explosions at a plastics plant last week, and three more bodies
were recovered from the rubble.
   Among those attending the 45-minute service at the John Ray
Harrison Convention Center were 259 relatives of those who died in
the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant disaster last Monday.
   ``No one can really explain why happenings such as this occur,''
said S.R. ``Buddy'' Jones Jr., chairman emeritus of Bank One of
Texas here. ``I surely don't know, but I do know this: a tragedy of
this magnitude brings us all closer together and demonstrates the
love, the care and the concern we have for one another.''
   Sgt. Jim Cluck, chaplain of the Police Department, asked
Phillips employees to honor those who died by having the strength
to return to work and live their lives ``the way they would want
you to live.''
   The recovery of three bodies brought the confirmed death toll to
17. The remains of five workers remain missing. The explosions
injured 124 people.
   Despite thunderstorms and heavy rain, work crews continued
moving tons of steel and concrete in hopes of recovering the last
of the victims.
   U.S. Rep. Mike Andrews, D-Texas, whose district includes this
city of 119,300, toured the plant and met with authorities.
   ``You really have to be here to see how absolutely devastating
that blast was,'' Andrews said. ``Fully a quarter of the plant has
been eliminated. There is still a safety factor at the plant site.
There are still fires burning. It is an awesome sight to see.''
   Much of the search has concentrated on the plant's control and
finishing rooms, where debris is stacked as high as 40 feet,
officials said.
   The polyethylene plant maufactured almost 20 percent of the
nation's production of plastic pellets used to make milk jugs and
grocery bags.
   Phillips officials believe flammable hydrocarbon vapor from
ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical
reactor, triggering the explosion. But company officials have said
they don't know how the gases were ignited and won't concentrate on
finding a cause until all the missing victims have been found.

   The comedy ``Look Who's Talking'' was the
nation's favorite movie for the third straight weekend, making it
Hollywood's biggest hit of the season.
   The horror film ``Shocker'' and the nature drama ``The Bear''
opened to steady business, while actor Mark Harmon's ``Worth
Winning'' bombed in its premiere.
   ``Look Who's Talking,'' starring John Travolta, Kirstie Alley
and the voice of Bruce Willis, grossed $11.6 million last weekend.
That raised its overall take to more than $45 million, more than
any other movie this fall, according to figures released Monday by
Entertainment Data Inc.
   Director Wes Craven's ``Shocker,'' a story about a television
repairman whose execution doesn't go quite according to plan,
finished second last weekend, collecting $4.5 million in ticket
sales.
   ``The Bear,'' which chronicles three bears and two hunters
struggling in the wilderness and broke several overseas box-office
marks, opened to a $3.7 million gate in limited release.
   ``Next of Kin,'' the Patrick Swayze-Liam Neeson adventure movie,
was in fourth place with $2.6 million. Next was the romantic
thriller ``Sea of Love,'' with Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin, which
sold $1.84 million worth of tickets. The international cop drama
``Black Rain'' was sixth with $1.75 million.
   In seventh was ``Gross Anatomy,'' a look at the lives of
students in their first year of medical school, with $1.74 million.
``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' starring Jeff Bridges and Michelle
Pfeiffer, landed in eighth with $1.73 million.
   In ninth was the adoption drama ``Immediate Family,'' with James
Woods and Glenn Close, opening weakly with $1.68 million. In 10th
was ``Worth Winning,'' starring Harmon in a game of sexual
one-upmanship. The movie collected just $1.5 million in its first
three days.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by
Entertainment Data.
   1. ``Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $11.6 million weekend
gross, 1,622 screens, $7,125 per screen, $45.4 million overall
gross, three weeks in release.
   2. ``Shocker,'' Universal, $4.5 million, 1,783 screens, $2,530
per screen, $4.5 million, one week.
   3. ``The Bear,'' Tri-Star, $3.7 million, 858 screens, $4,285 per
screen, $3.7 million, one week.
   4. ``Next of Kin,'' Warner Bros., $2.6 million, 1,358 screens,

   Fires broke out on the first night of a
three-night Halloween-time curfew Sunday as police, firefighters
and citizen volunteers tried to keep ``Devil's Night'' arson under
control.
   Asked how many fires had broken out, authorities said the
mayor's office would compile figures and release them on Monday. No
injuries were reported in any of the fires.
   Figures were also not available on the number of people arrested
under the curfew, said Police Officer John Leavens.
   An abandoned home was set on fire twice within 90 minutes, radio
station WWJ-AM reported. The second time, the blaze spread to an
occupied home.
   Several fires were reported in garages on the city's lower east
side, according to the station. Firefighters on the east side were
so busy that firefighters were called in from the west side.
   Police found several cases of dynamite, blasting caps and radio
control devices in the garage of a vacant home on the northeast
side Sunday night, but weren't sure whether it was connected with
Devil's Night, Leavens said.
   The police bomb squad took the explosives away for disposal.
   Fires are set during Devil's Night, which traditionally lasts
three nights, in a destructive celebration of Halloween. The
practice drew national attention in 1984, when 810 fires were set
in Detroit.
   Since then, the number of fires has decreased each year. Last
year, there were 229 fires reported, for an average of 76 per
night. About 65 fires are reported on a normal night in Detroit,
fire officials have said.
   The curfew, which allows police to detain anyone under 18, went
into effect at 6 p.m. and was to be in effect until 6 a.m. Monday
   In addition to police and firefighters, officials have said they
expected 30,000 volunteers would help patrol streets. The Fire
Department set up a special number for car phone callers.

<HEAD>Veterans' Administration to Reconsider Agent Orange Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advisory committee to the Department of
Veterans Affairs this week may open the door a crack to disability
benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   Responding to a federal court decision in May, the 15-member
Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards will look
again at scientific papers and studies on the herbicide used to
clear dense foliage that hid the enemy.
   This time, however, the committee will use standards considered
less strict than those used for determining other service-connected
disabilities.
   No one is predicting the outcome. But there is agreement that VA
Secretary Edward J. Derwinski wants to resolve the issue quickly
and in favor of veterans.
   ``I don't think he's going to fool around very long,'' VA
spokesman Don Smith said. ``He's so far exhibited a degree of
willingness _ if not impatience _ to go along rather rapidly with
this.''
   Once the committee does its work Derwinski is ``kind of on his
own as to how he wants to fly on this,'' Smith said. He said
Derwinski will make a final determination on the committee's
recommendations within two weeks of receiving results of the
meeting.
   According to one congressional source, Derwinski's actions mean
``he's almost promised people'' that he will take some positive
action for veterans.
   Veterans blame exposure to Agent Orange for cancers, skin
diseases and genetic damage leading to miscarriages or birth
defects. The committee will spend its first two days reviewing
about 20 or 30 studies on the connection between exposure and
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, one of the most frequently cited cancers,
then study other diseases at later meetings.
   On Friday, it will issue recommendations on non-Hodgkins
lymphoma and Agent Orange.
   The four-year-old advisory committee and government scientists
have thus far rejected a link between Agent Orange exposure and
health problems other than a skin condition known as chloracne.
   The American Legion, the prime veterans' group in this dispute,
contends the committee has a longstanding bias against veterans.
   Not so, says Oliver Meadows, the disabled veteran and scientific
layman in charge of the panel. ``Their greatest interest is their
own integrity as scientists,'' he said.
   The government says the main problem with studies up to now is
that there has been no way to verify exposure to dioxin. The
American Legion and others say the government has detailed records
on spraying activities that can be combined with equally detailed
records on troop movements.
   Agent Orange, an orange-brown liquid that was shipped in
orange-striped barrels, was sprayed in Vietnam from January 1965 to
April 1970. More than 230,000 veterans have registered with VA
claiming to have been exposed. More than 36,000 veterans have filed
for disability benefits claiming Agent Orange exposure caused their
problems, and two have been granted compensation _ for chloracne.
   Agent Orange is suspect because it contains ``phenoxy''
herbicides associated with certain cancers as well as dioxin, which
has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
   Dioxin's links to human health problems are disputed, although
its links to human birth defects are more firmly established.
   A ruling in May by U.S. District Judge Thelton E. Henderson in
San Francisco created a way out of the impasse over Agent Orange. A
new administration and the elevation of the Veterans'
Administration to cabinet status added another ingredient.
   Henderson ruled May 2 that the VA imposed an ``impermissibly
demanding test'' for linking Agent Orange with health problems.
   Although the VA has relied on a ``cause and effect''
relationship in determining service-connected disabilities, the
committee was to use a different standard: ``a significant
statistical association.''
   Derwinski told Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh on May 8
that he had decided against an appeal.
   New regulations for reviewing studies using the new standard,
effective Wednesday, say a link will be deemed to exist if the
studies associating Agent Orange with health problems outweigh the
evidence that there is no association.
   The regulations say the VA secretary can give the ``benefit of
the doubt to the conclusion that the association exists.''
   In early October, Derwinski named Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as a
special adviser with a specific emphasis on Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt ordered spraying of Agent Orange during Vietnam, and he
lost a son who served in Vietnam to a cancer linked with that
spraying. Zumwalt is known as a veterans' advocate on this issue.

   The nation's first black governor was a
freed slave and a savvy politician who served a caretaker period of
four weeks in Louisiana after the Civil War, historians say.
   Interest in P.B.S. Pinchback, Louisiana's governor from December
1872 to January 1873, has revived with the possible election in
Virginia this year of a black governor, Democrat L. Douglas Wilder.
   Wilder, Virginia's lieutenant governor and a grandson of freed
slaves, is running against Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former
attorney general who lost the state's 1981 election for governor.
   If Wilder wins, he would be the first elected black governor of
a U.S. state. Pinchback was not elected to the Louisiana office.
   Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback was ``the most intelligent,
resourceful and dynamic of the black legislators during
Reconstruction,'' said Mark T. Carleton, a history professor at
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. ``He was a very able
leader, a very persuasive speaker.''
   The son of a Georgia slave owner and a black slave, Pinchback
was freed by his father before the Civil War and was a captain in
the Union Army.
   After the war, Pinchback settled in Louisiana and joined the
Republican Party of blacks and radical whites. He was elected to
the Louisiana Senate in 1868 and was chosen as the chamber's
president pro tempore.
   When Lt. Gov. Oscar Dunn, who also was black, died in November
1871, Pinchback moved by constitutional succession to the state's
No. 2 office under Louisiana's carpetbag governor, Henry Clay
Warmoth.
   At the time, Warmoth was becoming a political maverick. A
Republican, he was attempting to shift his power base to the
Democrats, apparently sensing a revival of Louisiana's pre-war
white power structure.
   In the 1872 election, Warmoth supported President Grant's
opponent, Horace Greeley. But Grant won, and the next month the
Louisiana legislature brought impeachment proceedings against
Warmoth.
   During the trial, Pinchback became acting governor. The
impeachment case was still under way in January when Louisiana's
newly-elected Republican governor, William Pitt Kellogg, was sworn
into office.
   In his four weeks as governor, Pinchback did nothing of
consequence, said Lawrence N. Powell, a history professor at Tulane
University in New Orleans.
   ``He was a colorful, very adroit and pragmatic politician who
always seemed to manage to land on his feet,'' said Powell. ``In
Louisiana during Reconstruction, that was no mean feat.''
   Pinchback later was elected to Congress but was not seated
because the vote was contested. He eventually moved to Washington,
D.C., where he was a member of an informal Cabinet of black leaders
involved in national political matters. He died in 1921.
   Before Wilder's campaign in Virginia this year, major parties
have nominated two black politicans for governorships in recent
years.
   In 1982 and 1986, Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Bradley ran as
California's Democratic candidate for governor, losing both times
to Republican George Deukmejian. In 1986, Michigan Republican
William Lucas failed to unseat Democratic Gov. James J. Blanchard.

<HEAD>Availability of Abortion May One Day Hinge on State Courts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The availability of legal abortions for many
women may one day hinge on rulings by their state's highest court,
a key but often-overlooked battleground in the political fight over
abortion.
   Public focus thus far has centered on state legislatures,
Congress and the Supreme Court. But the role of state courts was
dramatically underscored on Oct. 5, when the Florida Supreme Court
ruled that the state constitution gives women a right to abortion.
   As a result, women in Florida would be unaffected if the
nation's highest court some day reverses its landmark 1973 decision
and says the federal Constitution does not provide the right to
abortion.
   If the Florida Legislature merely passed a law criminalizing
abortions, the state Supreme Court surely would overturn it.
Anti-abortion activists instead would have to try to amend the
state constitution, an involved process not undertaken successfully
since 1968.
   A state may never give its citizens fewer rights than those
guaranteed by the federal Constitution, but it is free to provide
greater rights. And the ultimate interpreter of each state's
constitution is not the U.S. Supreme Court but that state's highest
court.
   For example, although governmental refusals to fund abortions
for women on welfare have survived attacks based on the federal
Constitution, such refusals were ruled invalid under the
constitutions of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey
and Vermont.
   The Florida court's broad ruling was not unprecedented. The
California Supreme Court years ago found an abortion right in its
state's constitution.
   Both state courts based their decisions on explicit statements
guaranteeing the right of privacy. Although no other court has
ruled directly on a right to abortion, at least five other state
constitutions _ those of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Louisiana and
Montana _ provide a right of privacy.
   In a few other states, most notably New Jersey and
Massachusetts, rulings by the highest court have implied a state
privacy right that could include the right to abortion.
   ``We have studied those state constitutions and are looking at
the makeup of the highest court in each of those states,'' said
Dawn Johnsen, legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League.
   Part of the abortion rights strategy will be to ask state, not
federal, courts to overturn new restrictive laws based on state
constitutional grounds.
   Mary Spaulding of the National Right to Life Committee says her
organization began to focus on state constitutions long before the
Florida ruling.
   ``This battle will be in the states, and state court rulings on
their constitutions therefore are included,'' she said. ``We know
we have a problem in some states, and we are studying the matter.''
   In those states in which there is no state constitutional right
of privacy, challenges to restrictive abortion laws might be based
on such legal notions as liberty, due process, equal protection and
sexual equality.
   Such moves likely will be accompanied by efforts, on both sides
of the fight, to amend state constitutions and to reshape the
memberships of state legislatures and high courts.
   Patricia Ireland of the National Organization for Women says
getting more abortion rights supporters appointed to state high
courts must be made part of ``the feminization of power'' her group
seeks.
   ``State courts are part of the political package we are looking
at,'' she said. ``They are present and future arenas.''

<HEAD>Former Radio Free Europe-Poland Leader Gets Hero's Welcome</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before Solidarity took power in Poland, Jan
Nowak was the communist government's ``enemy No. 1'' because for 24
years he headed the Polish section of Radio Free Europe, the
U.S.-sponsored radio station that beams into the Soviet bloc.
   When Nowak returned to Warsaw Aug. 28 for his first visit since
1945, he was stunned to find the airport crammed with senior
Solidarity leaders. They took time out from forming the first
non-communist government in the Soviet Bloc to welcome him as a
hero.
   Lech Walesa called Nowak's return ``a visible symbol of
change,'' said Nowak, and his warm reception was symbolic of an
improved status for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty behind the
crumbling Iron Curtain.
   The stations were created in 1950 and 1951 during the Cold War,
and despite their ups and downs over the years, are thriving in the
current thaw. Nowak headed the Polish section for 24 years starting
in 1951.
   Official Polish television, which formerly condemned the
so-called ``foreign voices'' that carried news censored from
state-run media, not only reported Nowak's triumphant return, it
broadcast an interview with him.
   When Nowak stepped out the next day, ``to take a nostalgic walk
through the city I had not visited for 45 years,'' a taxi driver
veered over, took him around town, and refused to accept payment.
   ``The driver told me he had seen the airport arrival on
television. He said, `I listened to Radio Free Europe for so many
years without paying anything. How can I take money from you?''
Nowak, 76, recalled during an interview after he returned to his
home near Washington.
   Like Nowak, Radio Free Europe and its sister station, Radio
Liberty, are enjoying their new role not only in Poland but in the
Soviet Union and other countries of the communist bloc.
   ``It has become a very exciting place to be ... The radios are
on the cutting edge'' of the changes underway in the Soviet bloc,
said Gene Pell, a former NBC-TV correspondent who now directs the
twin radio stations.
   The stations were founded by the Central Intelligence Agency,
and in 1971, after revelations of CIA misdeeds, were separated from
the spy agency and funded by Congress.
   Congressional reports requested by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee in 1984-85 criticized the stations for sometimes
broadcasting material considered abusive of communist and
government officials in the Soviet bloc.
   Since Pell took over in November 1985, said a foreign relations
committee aide, ``he has done a fine job in curbing the problems we
saw four years ago.''
   But media in the Soviet bloc continued to depict ``the voices''
as branches of the CIA, jammed their broadcasts to major cities,
and bitterly condemned emigres like Nowak who worked for them.
   Nevertheless, the stations had an audience estimated at 50
million, according to the 1985 congressional report.
   Under the reforms launched since then by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the vituperation has ended and the audience
has expanded.
   ``The major breakthrough was in November of last year, when they
turned the jammers off,'' Pell said in a recent interview in
Washington.
   Taking advantage of the thaw, Radio Liberty, which broadcasts to
the Soviet Union, has hired reporters in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev
and Novosibirsk, said Pell, who was the NBC correspondent in Moscow
in the late 1970's, when most Soviets feared speaking with
Westerners and could receive prison sentences of up to seven years
for listening to Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.
   Radio Free Europe _ which broadcasts to the rest of the Soviet
bloc _ has received permission to open an office in Hungary, and
wants a bureau in Warsaw.
   Official press criticisms have tapered off, and the weekly
Moscow News last year praised Radio Liberty's coverage of the
December 1988 earthquake in Armenia, calling it better than Radio
Moscow's.
   ``In this case, we heard on a foreign band what we should have
heard on our own,'' Vladimir Ostrogorsky wrote in the Dec. 18,
1988, Moscow News.
   Although Ostrogorsky said the ``voices'' in the past had
broadcast ``rumors, misrepresentations and outright lies,'' and had
``pushed their own ideological goods packaged as information,'' he
praised the end of the jamming as testimony ``to the progress of
glasnost'' or greater openness.
   Pell said, ``Simultaneously, another thing happened, the most
significant of all. The place opened up. We could call people, they
could call us.''
   Broadcasters in Munich tape reports from throughout the Soviet
bloc, and transmit them back in.
   ``We now have a broadcast called `at the kiosk,' in which our
Moscow correspondent reads excerpts from press reports the same day
they are published,'' said Pell. The show is popular because the
most interesting newspapers sell out quickly even in major cities,
and may not be available at all elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   State police and guards kept watch Sunday
over the remaining inmates at a riot-torn state prison, and
investigations were planned to determine what caused two nights of
bloody violence at the overcrowded penitentiary.
   In Philadelphia, a small fire broke out at a city prison Sunday
night, forcing authorities to move about 100 inmates, said a police
detective who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   No one was injured in the fire at Northeast Detention Center,
which came one night after a much more serious riot at another city
prison and was the fifth disturbance to hit a Pennsylvania prison
within a week.
   The 100 inmates were taken to a gymnasium as smoke from the fire
cleared, the detective said. Four young men refused to return to
their cells, and guards forced them to return, according to the
officer.
   The prison near Camp Hill, where more than 100 people were
injured in two nights of rioting last week, was calm Sunday, said
Corrections Department spokesman Kenneth Robinson.
   The uprising there and at other prisons resulted in injuries to
at least 183 people.
   Camp Hill's troubles came between a disturbance at the
Huntingdon state prison that left 48 injured last Monday and one at
a Philadelphia County prison Saturday night, which resulted in
serious injuries to three guards and the hospitalization of nine
inmates.
   The Camp Hill uprising left at least 123 injured, almost half of
the facility's buildings destroyed or damaged by fire, and hundreds
of inmates without cells.
   Five people taken hostage Thursday were released Friday when
state police stormed the prison, restoring order after a
building-by-building assault.
   Robinson said 744 Camp Hill inmates had been transferred to
other state prisons since Friday. He said 200 more inmates would be
sent to a new federal prison in Bradford in northwest Pennsylvania,
and as many as 600 others would be sent in groups of 50 to other
federal jails.
   Hundreds of convicts had been forced to sleep on the ground at
Camp Hill under the eyes of guards and police officers.
   With the transfers and cleaning and repairing cells at Camp
Hill, officials hoped to make cell space available for all inmates
by Monday, Robinson said.
   ``We've got a lot of people in there cleaning up cellblocks as
well as the kitchen buildings,'' Robinson said.
   The disturbance Saturday at Holmesburg Prison, a county jail in
Philadelphia, was a ``copycat'' of the Camp Hill riot, said city
Prison Commissioner J. Patrick Gallagher.
   During the riot, which officials said began after an argument
between several prisoners and a guard, inmates could be heard
chanting, ``Camp Hill, Camp Hill.''
   Forty-seven guards and 114 inmates were taken to hospitals, and
nine inmates were admitted, three with head wounds, Gallagher said.
Other convicts suffered broken bones and cuts, said hospital
officials, who did not have an exact count. Three of the 47 guards
suffered broken bones and deep cuts, but none were hospitalized,
Gallagher said.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey said Saturday that he would appoint an
independent commission to investigate why inmates rebelled at Camp
Hill on Wednesday and how they were able to get out of their locked
cells to resume and escalate the violence Thursday.
   The state Senate Judiciary Committee and a state House Judiciary
subcommittee also planned to conduct their own reviews. At least
one of the committees plans to study prison overcrowding, a problem
at both state and county prisons.
   Officials say overcrowding may have been a contributing factor
to the two state-prison problems as well as the Philadelphia
disturbance.
   Casey said he also would back a criminal investigation of the
riot, accelerate plans to replace the lost prison space and lessen
overcrowding elsewhere, move to punish the inmates behind the
uprising and review the need for more corrections officers.
   After the first day of violence ended Wednesday, Camp Hill
superintendent Robert Freeman said the prison did not have enough
guards to deal with the prison population, which was 45 percent
over capacity when the riots began.
   No damage estimate was available yet.
   Robinson said four of the five hostages Thursday had been
released from hospitals. The remaining guard was in fair condition.
Three other prison staffers and six convicts also remained
hospitalized Sunday.

<HEAD>Congress Looking Into Decline in US Oats Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decline in U.S. oats production is prompting
Congress to look into the situation, and Agriculture Department
analysts say consumer demand for oatmeal is one of the many factors
for consideration.
   Some believe the government's price support program for oats
should be modified to encourage farmers to plant more oats instead
of turning to other feed grains such as barley, corn or sorghum.
   Whatever remedies are forthcoming, the United States since 1982
has been a net importer of oats instead of an exporter. Canada,
Sweden, Finland and Argentina are the major foreign suppliers.
   ``The U.S. market share of all world (oats) imports rose to an
annual average of 44 percent in 1985-88, largest of all importing
countries,'' says the department's Economic Research Service.
   The agency, in a new staff report prepared as background for
1990 farm legislation, said oats are grown in most states but are
concentrated in the North Central region, including the Dakotas,
Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska.
   In the 1950s, oats were grown on more than 40 million acres, and
annual farm prices averaged 58 cents to 72 cents per bushel. In
recent years, oats have been produced on 6 million to 10 million
acres, with farm prices climbing from $1.21 per bushel in 1986 to
$1.56 in 1987 and a record $2.67 in 1988.
   The value of oats production in 1987 ranked 16th among major
U.S. field crops at $606 million. By comparison, corn was $14
billion; soybeans, $11.3 billion; hay, $9 billion; and wheat, $5.5
billion.
   ``The principal domestic use of oats is for livestock feed,
although it has recently become a specialty feed for race and
pleasure horses,'' the report said.
   Oats as human food includes the traditional oatmeal, along with
oat flour, natural cereals, meat product extenders, cookies and
breads, granola, oat bran and baby food.
   ``Recent medical research has shown that certain fibrous plant
materials in the diet can lower serum cholesterol concentrations,''
the report said. ``The fibers, however, must be water soluble. Oat
bran is water soluble, but wheat bran is not. Water-soluble dietary
fibers also lower post-meal blood glucose levels in
insulin-dependent diabetics.''
   The report added: ``Thus, oat bran or whole oats is beginning to
play a larger role in improving health through diet. Oats
consumption by humans appears to be increasing, as U.S. diets seem
to be shifting toward cereal-based foods and away from fatty,
high-protein animal-based foods.''

   Agriculture Department scientists say they
have developed a new lethal snack for cockroaches, grasshoppers,
crickets and fire ants that smells too yummy to resist.
   The bait includes corn mash left over from the manufacture of
fuel-grade alcohol, ethanol, and a water-absorbent gel. The mixture
is laced with a slow-release insecticide.
   According to the department's Agricultural Research Service, the
new bait was initially designed to use against cockroaches. But
researchers at the agencies insect laboratory in Gainesville, Fla.,
found it attracted the other species, too.
   Entomologist Richard J. Brenner said the combination of corn
mash and gel tends to retain moisture and ``remains aromatic under
high temperatures and dry conditions.'' That makes it particularly
attractive to roaches, which become hungry and thirsty when the
temperature rises.
   The bait has been tested in the field as well as in the
laboratory, and is waiting on approval by the Environmental
Protection Agency, he said.
   Although the mash-gel combination was developed by Brenner and
an agency colleague, Richard S. Patterson, there are two other
co-inventors: Roger R. Pierce of Pierce Services Inc., Cashier,
N.C., and Marvin Hult of Air Vent Inc., Peoria, Ill.
   Air Vent and Pierce Services signed research agreements with the
USDA agency in February 1988 and hold first rights to license the
bait when a patent is granted.
   Pierce, to protect the bait's aroma and moisture during storage,
suggested wrapping the bait in wax film that a hungry cockroach can
open easily. Hult recommended using a bait holder, which would
extend the shelf life of the mixture and protect it until ready for
use.
   Brenner said that while the corn mash attracts roaches, hoppers,
crickets and fire ants, it doesn't attract warm-blooded animals as
do baits of fruit, bread, raisins or beer.

   The world's rice production is expected to
rise slightly in 1989-90 but will fall short of meeting global
demands, according to Agriculture Department projections.
   Significant harvest increases are expected in China, Indonesia,
the Philippines and Japan, said the department's Economic Research
Service. India's production may drop 6 percent from last year's
record level but still would be the second-largest.
   Total foreign rice production was forecast at 326 million metric
tons, and the U.S. crop at 4.93 million tons, milled equivalent.
   Analysts said that would be the fourth straight year that U.S.
rice production has fallen short of total use, meaning another
reduction in the U.S. rice stockpile by next Aug. 1.

   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan will have
``absolute control'' over a TV docudrama about her two years in
jail for refusing to tell a judge the whereabouts of her daughter,
an attorney says.
   The Washington, D.C.-area plastic surgeon signed with Lansburg
Co., makers of ``Adam,'' a television movie about a boy who was
kidnapped and murdered, said Shelley Browning, an attorney who
negotiated the deal for Morgan.
   Morgan has alleged that her former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich,
an oral surgeon, sexually molested their child, Hilary, now 7.
   Foretich vehemently denies the charges.
   Morgan was jailed in 1987 for civil contempt of court by the
judge presiding over their custody dispute. Morgan refused to
comply when the judge ordered her to allow Foretich unsupervised
visits.
   She was released one month ago from the Washington, D.C., jail
after Congress approved special legislation.
   Ms. Morgan will be a consultant on the film and will wield
``final, absolute control over what appears,'' Ms. Browning said
last week.
   When informed of the movie deal, Foretich said: ``I will
absolutely sue them if my name or my daughter's name is used
without my consent.''
   Ms. Browning said she expects to win any lawsuit by Foretich
because ``he has made himself a public figure.''
   Morgan's fee, an undisclosed amount totaling less than $250,000,
will go into a trust fund for Hilary, Ms. Browning said.

   A trainer jet crash-landed Sunday
afternoon on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier Lexington in
the Gulf of Mexico, killing five people and injuring at least two,
the Navy said.
   The 3:30 p.m. CST crash of the two-seat T-2 Buckeye caused
several fires on the World War II-era ship that sailors quickly
brought under control, officials said.
   The Lexington, the Navy's oldest aircraft carrier, was 30 miles
south of its home port of Pensacola when the accident occurred,
said Harry White, a civilian spokesman at Pensacola Naval Air
Station.
   Officers on the ship said five people were killed in the
crash-landing and at least two were injured, said White.
   The jet was assigned to Training Squadron 19, based at the
Meridian, Miss., Naval Air Station, White said. The victims'
identities were being withheld pending notification of their
relatives.
   In addition to destroying the jet, the crash did major damage to
two aircraft on the flight deck and minor damage to another, said
Army Maj. John Smith, a spokesman at the Pentagon.
   Navy helicopters took the dead and injured to the West Florida
Regional Medical Center and the U.S. Navy Hospital in Pensacola,
and to the University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile,
authorities said.
   One of the injured, Anthony Lopez, 21, was in critical but
stable condition at the Mobile hospital with second- and
third-degree burns over 40 to 45 percent of his body, hospital
spokeswoman Monica Knight said. Lopez was the only sailor brought
to that hospital, she said. White said he did not know Lopez's rank
or hometown.
   The Lexington was heading back to Pensacola, and was expected to
arrive at the city's commercial port around 10 a.m. Monday,
officials said.
   The Coast Guard sent a jet from Mobile to fly a team of ordnance
experts in Panama City to Pensacola, Coast Guard Lt. Mark Kasper
said in New Orleans. The Navy apparently was concerned that fuel
cells aboard the jet might explode after being damaged in the
crash, Kasper said.
   The 46-year-old Lexington is the only aircraft carrier used
exclusively by the Navy for training. It has 1,440 men and women
assigned to it.
   The accident occurred a week before the 45th anniversary of a
Japanese kamikaze attack that killed 47 crew members and injured
127 on Nov. 4, 1944.
   The original Lexington crew plans to hold a reunion next weekend
in Pensacola that includes a day cruise on the carrier on Saturday,
Nov. 4, to commemorate the attack.
   The Lexington was commissioned on Feb. 17, 1943. Its planes sank
or destroyed more than a million tons of Japanese shipping and
1,039 enemy aircraft.
   The carrier was dubbed ``The Blue Ghost'' by Japanese
propagandist Tokyo Rose during World War II because she had
reported it sunk several times only to have it return to battle,
painted a solid blue-grey color, unusual in wartime when ships are
usually camouflaged.
   The Lexington was mothballed after the war, but was reactivated
in 1955. It reported to Pensacola on Dec. 29, 1962, to serve as the
Navy's training carrier. It is scheduled to continue that role
after moving next September to Corpus Christi, Texas.
   The ship has been a favorite of movie producers with roles in
the film ``Midway'' and the made-for-television mini-series ``War
and Remembrance.''

   The Supreme Court is being asked to decide
whether a federal judge may impose a tax increase to pay for
court-ordered school desegregation in Kansas City, Mo.
   At issue in today's oral arguments is a federal judge's 1987
order doubling the property tax of residents in the Kansas City
school district to finance a court-ordered plan for racially
desegregating the public schools.
   Legal scholars and education officials say the court's decision
could shape future school desegregation plans across the country
and define the federal courts' power to remedy constitutional
violations involving issues from prison overcrowding to fair
housing.
   The state of Missouri is asking the justices to overturn a
decision by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the
property tax increase ordered by U.S. District Judge Russell Clark.
The state contends that the federal courts lack the power to order
higher taxes even to correct a constitutional violation such as
racial discrimination in schools.
   The school district and a group of school children, who brought
the original desegregation case in 1977, are urging the high court
to uphold the tax decision. The district contends that state
property tax law and local voters cannot be allowed to frustrate
the constitutional rights of Kansas City's minority schoolchildren
to an equal educational opportunity.
   Clark ordered the tax increase in September 1987 after the local
school district was unable to pay its share of a more than $400
million desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements
in buildings and establishment of special ``magnet'' schools.
   State law says local property taxes may be raised only with
voters' approval, and in some instances only with a two-thirds
majority. District voters had not approved a levy increase since
1969, with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to
finance the desegregation plan.
   In addition to doubling the property tax, Clark imposed an
income tax surcharge on those people living or working in the
school district.
   The appeals court struck down the income surcharge in August
1988, but upheld the district court's authority to order an
increase in the property tax. However, the appeals court modified
the procedure for imposing the higher tax levy.
   The appeals court found that state law had effectively prevented
the school district from levying the necessary taxes to pay for the
desegregation plan. It upheld Clark's order as one that ``set aside
levy limitations,'' and empowered the elected local school board to
set the needed tax levels within certain limits.

   Nearly six weeks after Hurricane Hugo
hit, horse carriages are clopping through city streets, golfers are
back on the links, and tourism officials have begun a campaign to
lure tourists back.
   ``We want to create an awareness that we weren't wiped off the
face of the Earth,'' says Helen Stansell of the Charleston Trident
Chamber of Commerce.
   Hugo, which cut a swath of destruction along more than half of
the state's 187-mile coastline on Sept. 21, resulted in an
estimated $200 million loss to the state's $4.7 billion a year
tourism industry. The industry provides 98,000 jobs and $280
million annually in state tax revenues.
   ``What we had hoped for was an 8 percent growth on $4.7 billion
spending in 1988,'' said Bob Liming, tourism director for the state
Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism.
   ``What we're looking at now is a growth of 3 to 4 percent,'' he
said. ``We did have a very good summer and the first part of the
fall was good from Labor Day until the storm hit.''
   State and local tourism groups are telling U.S. and Canadian
travel agents that travel spots are open. Myrtle Beach officials
are raising $500,000 for a national advertising campaign.
   In the Myrtle Beach area, 62 of the area's 63 golf courses are
open. Hilton Head Island and other tourist points south of
Charleston sustained little, if any damage.
   In Charleston, about 95 percent of the 10,000 tourist rooms are
open, and most of the area's more than 500 restaurants have
reopened, Ms. Stansell said.
   The annual candlelight tour of historic homes is scheduled for
next month, and Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, where the first
shots of the Civil War were fired, reopened to visitors last week.
   ``The Number 1 reason people come to Charleston is because of
the historic appeal. We were fortunate we didn't lose any of
that,'' she said.
   Nearby Ashley River plantation museums have reopened.
   Post-storm reports that Middleton Place plantation was destroyed
were exaggerated, apparently when reporters flying over it thought
the ruins left by Sherman's troops in the Civil War were from Hugo.
   At the Patriots Point maritime museum in Mount Pleasant, across
the Cooper River from Charleston, the storm knocked the 27,100-ton
aircraft carrier Yorktown into a pier. Still, the museum reopened
about 1{ weeks later.
   Some attractions will take longer to recover.
   Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant isn't expected to reopen
until around Thanksgiving, and Charlestown Landing State Park will
remain closed until at least January, said Ms. Stansell.
   The worst damage was on the state's beachfront, where Hugo
washed away homes and condominiums. But most major hotels survived
and the beach season is over for the year.
   Wild Dunes resort on the Isle of Palms again plans to play host
to the U.S. Clay Courts tennis championship in the spring,
officials said.
   And Hilton Head Island escaped unscathed, although cancellations
in the wake of Hugo resulted in an estimated $2.5 million loss.
   The state has embarked on a plan to restore beaches in the
Myrtle Beach area with Gov. Carroll Campbell promising that
tourists next year will find those beaches in better shape than
before the storm.
   Publicity about the storm ironically may prove a boon.
   ``What we're finding is that people who didn't know South
Carolina had so much beach and so many historic sites do now,''
said Liming.

   About 95 percent of the 10,000 hotel and motel rooms are open as

wind through the streets.
   The Ashley River plantations are open as are Fort Sumter in
Charleston Harbor and Patriots Point Maritime Museum in nearby
Mount Pleasant. Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant is expected
to reopen around Thanksgiving but visitors are not expected to
return to Charlestown Landing State Park until early next year.
   Heavy damage to beachfront summer homes and rentals on Sullivans
Island, the Isle of Palms and Folly Beach. Wild Dunes Resort on the

   About 75 percent of the 25,000 hotel and motel rooms operated by

It's unclear how many of the remainder are closed because of the
storm or are simply closed for the season. No major hotels were
destroyed by the storm. Sixty-two of the area's 63 golf courses are
also open. Hotels and motels on the south end of Myrtle Beach
suffered damage to pools and other amenities.
   Heavy damage to beachfront condominiums and summer rental homes

<TEXT>
   Congressional conservatives, grappling with
glasnost, are having trouble coming to terms with the changes,
disclosures and confessions of the government of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   There is little unity of opinion.
   An example is the reaction to the recent admissions by Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze regarding Afghanistan and the
construction of a long-controversial advanced radar system.
   Shevardnadze admitted the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979
was immoral, illegal and a mistake.
   He said construction of a sophisticated, phased-array radar
system at Krasnoyarsk in the central Soviet Union was what its
critics always said it was _ an outright and direct violation of
the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   Two of the Senate's most conservative members took a look at the
two confessions and came away with sharply different impressions of
the Soviet Union's new openness.
   One said glasnost had brought new evidence of Soviet duplicity,
new reason to distrust any arms control treaty with the Kremlin.
The other saw a new cause for hope.
   One offered applause; the other, jeers.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said the admission that the
Krasnoyarsk radar was a treaty violation is all the evidence one
could want that the Soviet Union intends to violate treaties before
it signs them, does violate them, lies about the violations and
can't be trusted, now or in the future.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., however, reacted to the news of
the Soviet change of position on the invasion of Afghanistan by
saying, ``Bravo.''
   The policy shift could be the beginning of a turnaround to
permit the Afghan people to choose their own government, free of
Soviet intervention, Humphrey said.
   Concentrating on Shevardnadze's admission about the radar, Helms
said he had pointed to it as the ``smoking gun of Soviet arms
control cheating'' shortly after U.S. intelligence detected it in
summer 1983.
   Helms noted that Soviet officials spent years denying the radar
installation was a treaty violation.
   Helms concluded: ``Mr. Shevardnadze has finally admitted the
fundamental duplicity of Soviet foreign policy. He has finally
admitted that the Soviets conduct arms control negotiations on the
basis of falsehood, cheat on solemn arms control treaties and then
try to camouflage and conceal their duplicity.''
   The admission confirms the suspicion that the Soviets signed the
ABM treaty, the SALT I and SALT II treaties, and the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces or INF treaty fully intending to violate all of
them, Helms asserted.
   Helms said he believed the Soviets made the admission only
because the evidence had become so massive that it constituted ``a
significant barrier to improving U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   ``This admission totally undermines any basis of trust in future
treaties with the Soviet Union,'' Helms asserted.
   Focusing on Afghanistan, Humphrey sounded an opposite note.
Glasnost appears to be paying dividends at last, he said.
   Humphrey has been the Senate's most persistent and outspoken
critic of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
   But now, he said, ``the time has come for some praise.''
   Shevardnadze called the Soviet invasion _ which occurred during
the rule of the late Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev _ ``the most
serious violation of our own legislation, of party and civic norms
and ethical standards of the times.''
   ``This sort of frank admission of sins long denied bodes well
for the success of glasnost, for openness and honesty of Soviet
officials,'' Humphrey said. ``... I say bravo.''
   The admission of error, he said, allows him to hope that the
Soviets soon will end their support for the Marxist regime left
behind in Kabul when the Soviet occupation army withdrew from
Afghanistan.
   Humphrey concluded: ``I salute Mr. Gorbachev for the courage to
proclaim glasnost, for the courage to persist where glasnost has
led to painful re-evaluations and even admissions of grave error.''

   The District of Columbia matched its year-old
record for homicides Sunday with five killings during a seven-hour
weekend period that pushed this year's total to 369 homicides.
   Three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs, as are the
majority of the deaths in the nation's capital, and the other two
were a 13-year-old girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to
death in their apartment on Saturday.
   The most recent victim was a 41-year-old man found dead of
multiple gunshot wounds early Sunday. He had $11,000 cash and a
large quantity of heroin in his pockets when his body was found,
according to police homicide detectives.
   ``It's awful. But people in this community are resorting to
deadly violence to resolve conflict,'' said police spokesman Lt.
Reginald Smith.
   Police have estimated more than half the city's killings are
tied to drugs, with crack cocaine fueling much of the violence.
   They said last at the end of 1988 that 372 people were killed in
homicides, but a police revised that number downward Sunday when
they subtracted three victims of police shootings from the official
total.
   Police said they charged Steve Lewis Patterson, 24, with two
counts of murder in the deaths late Saturday night of Brenda R.
Sams, 34, and her niece, Keaena Sams. Police described Patterson as
Brenda Sams' boyfriend.
   Domestic disputes caused the second highest number of deaths in
the city last year, police have said.

   The Socialists scored a third straight
electoral victory, but Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's
parliamentary majority dwindled to just one seat through defections
to the left, results showed today.
   Analysts credited a four-year economic boom and confidence in
the future as helping push the Socialist Party over the top in
Sunday's general elections.
   However, they said, the governing party's majority was sharply
reduced because organized labor was angry over Gonzalez's
pro-business policies and unwillingness to further boost social
spending.
   The man who first rose to power in 1982 has helped give Spain
Europe's fastest growing economy.
   In Sunday's balloting, the Socialists won 176 seats, or 39.55
percent of the vote, the minimum needed for a majority of the 350
seats in Parliament's powerful lower house. They had won 184 seats
in 1986 elections.
   The biggest gains were won by the United Left coalition that
includes the Communist Party, which increased its seats to 17, with
9 percent of the vote, from the seven seats in 1986.
   With all the votes counted, Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera
also announced these results early today in the Cortes, or lower
house: the conservative Popular Party, 106 seats, 25.83 percent of
the vote; the Catalan Convergence and Union, 18 seats, 5 percent;
the Democratic and Social Center of former prime minister Adolfo
Suarez, 14 seats, 8 percent.
   The remaining seats were divided among eight smaller parties.
   The Popular Party under 36-year-old Jose Maria Aznar, an
inexperienced former tax collector who took over just two months
ago, remained the largest opposition force. However, it gained just
one seat in this election.
   In the 208-seat Senate, the Socialists won 109 seats, the
Popular Party 74, the Convergence and Union 10, the United Left 1
and the Democratic and Social Center 3. The remaining seats went to
the smaller parties.
   During the campaign, United Left leader Julio Anguita hammered
away at the Socialists, saying they had failed to distribute fairly
the benefits of the country's newly generated wealth.
   The Communists won 20 seats in 1977 general elections after the
death two years earlier of Gen. Francisco Franco and Spain's return
to democracy. However, they had suffered a constant decline until
Sunday's vote.
   Gonzalez, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer and underground
political activist during the Franco era, has provided the country
with firm leadership, guiding it out of near bankruptcy in 1982 to
solvency and a starring role in the 12-nation European Community.
   ``With these results, it is possible to govern (alone),'' the
prime minister said, ``and we're going to do it with the same hope
and democratic attitude we've shown since 1982,'' when he swept to
victory with a landslide.
   Analysts said the United Left coalition won the protest vote by
throwing support behind the nation's two largest unions in their
bitter battle with the government for greater spending on pensions,
unemployment insurance and wages for civil servants.
   The coalition went from fewer than 1 million votes in 1986 to
1.8 million votes Sunday, apparently snapping up the 900,000 votes
that the Socialists lost, according to electoral experts.
   However, Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga quickly dismissed any
notion that the coalition would influence the Socialists to move
away from the pro-business policies that have contributed to
Spain's average growth rate of 4.5 percent over the past four
years, the highest in Europe.
   He said the Socialist government ``needs no leftward swing or
allies.''
   Inflation dropped from 14 percent in 1982 to 5 percent last
year, although it is now running at 7 percent.
   ``Despite the drop in votes, any way one looks at the third
Socialist majority, it appears to be further confirmation that the
Spanish society sees Gonzalez as its best leader,'' said veteran
political comentator Pedro Altares.
   Spain is the third European country, after Sweden and Austria,
to witness three successive terms of Socialist majority governments.
   The 69.9 percent turnout rate among the nation's 29.5 million
registered voters was up slightly from the 68.9 percent in the 1986
elections. But it was significantly lower than the 80 percent in
the 1982 contest.

   A teen-ager driving a stolen concrete mixer

ended when an officer blew out tires with a shotgun, police said.
   No one was injured in the chase, but the 15-ton truck crushed a
Haines City police car and a state Game and Fresh Water Fish

Auburndale, police said.
   Richard Booker Branch, 18, of Davenport, was charged with
burglary, grand theft and aggravated assault on a law enforcement
officer. He was taken to the Polk County Jail.
   The incident began at about 2:30 a.m. EST Saturday, when a
police officer noticed the truck in Bartow, which is 45 miles east
of Tampa.
   Police said Branch drove the truck at speeds from 35 to 50 mph
through Dundee, Lake Hamilton, Lake Wales, Haines City, Davenport,
Poinciana and Polk. After a police officer shot out several tires,
police apprehended Branch, who tried to flee on foot.

<HEAD>Kremlin Would Not Object to Hungary Leaving Warsaw Pact, Official
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bush administration official expresses
surprise at Soviet statements that the Kremlin would not object if
Hungary chose to leave the Warsaw Pact or East Germany chose to
reunite with West Germany.
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond G. Seitz said Sunday the
remarks by Soviet party spokesman Nikolai Shishlin on Hungary and
the Warsaw Pact indicated a new Kremlin policy.
   ``I found his description about what the commitment to the
Warsaw Pact was, rather surprising,'' Seitz said Sunday on ABC's
``This Week With David Brinkley'' program. ``He seemed to suggest
that there was choice involved,'' Seitz said.
   ``That would be welcome news, if it is correct. But that is not
what the Soviet government has been saying,'' Seitz said.
   Previously, Soviet and Hungarian officials have stressed that
Hungary would stay in the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   The statements by Shishlin and Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennadi Gerasimov followed a declaration by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev last week his nation had no moral right to interfere with
changes underway in the Soviet bloc nations of Eastern Europe.
   Gorbachev also declared a willingness to dissolve the Warsaw
Pact if the West disbands the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a
step the Bush administration has rejected as an effort to cut U.S.
influence in Europe.
   Shishlin, appearing on ABC, was asked whether the Soviet Union
would object if Hungary decided to leave the Warsaw Pact.
   ``We respect the Hungarian choice, anyhow. We are not afraid of
these changes,'' said Shishlin.
   Asked whether Hungary was ``free to leave the Warsaw Pact,''
Shishlin replied: ``Surely. But you know that Hungarian officials
declared that they are ready to be in the Warsaw Pact, until now.''
   In 1956, a declaration by Hungarian leader Imre Nagy that his
nation would quit the alliance prompted Soviet military
intervention. In recent months, reform leaders elected to power in
Hungary and Poland have declared their intention to remain in the
Soviet alliance.
   Shishlin also appeared to leave the door open to reunification
of West and East Germany, which have been divided since World War
II. The U.S. and West German governments historically have favored
unification, but the East German and Soviet governments have not.
   In light of the turmoil in East Germany, Shishlin said: ``Nobody
can predict what will happen. And I am sure that this situation
should be changed and it will be changed.''
   ``How will it be changed?,'' Shishlin was asked.
   ``By the right of choice,'' he replied.
   ``Everything depends on the Germans. But it is necessary to
understand our interests, not to destabilize the situation in
Europe,'' he said. ``Let us wait a little bit, and I think we will
find a new situation.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gerasimov, appearing on the
syndicated program, ``One-On-One,'' called the new policy ``the
Frank Sinatra Doctrine.''
   ``Frank Sinatra has a very popular song, `I Had it My Way.' So,
Hungary, Poland, every other country, has its own way. They decide
which road to take. It's their business. And we watch, watch
closely, but we do not interfere,'' said Gerasimov.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, appearing on a different segment of
``One-on-One,'' said the administration was ``encouraged by
President Gorbachev's statement and the fact that he says that the
Soviet Union does not have the right to interfere ... with Eastern
Europe. That's positive.''
   Quayle advised caution in reacting to statements by Soviet
leaders.
   ``We hope that perestroika succeeds,'' he said, using the
Russian word for Gorbachev's reforms. ``But as they talk about the
Frank Sinatra doctrine _ also remember the Nancy Sinatra doctrine
in song, `These Boots Are Made for Walking.'''

   As rescue workers dug for earthquake
victims amid the crushed bodies and smell of death on the collapsed
Nimitz freeway, the minds of some were not in Oakland but in the
steaming jungles of Southeast Asia.
   A stress expert said Vietnam veterans among the rescue workers
began suffering emotional flashbacks as they pulled body after body
from the rubble of the freeway that collapsed during the Oct. 17
quake, killing at least 39 people.
   ``More than half the construction workers were Vietnam vets,''
said Tom Williams, a psychologist and Vietnam veteran himself who
went to the freeway to counsel workers. ``They started talking
about Vietnam again.''
   While the most obvious stress victims are those who lost a loved
one and workers dealing with violent death, experts say everyone
who lived through the temblor is at risk of emotional upheaval.
   ``There are 6 million people affected emotionally by the quake
in this area,'' Williams said. ``San Francisco looks normal, but if
you stop anybody and ask them where they were during the
earthquake, you will listen to a litany of stress.''
   Social workers and mental health experts warn that increases in
physical abuse, depression and possibly suicide will follow the
7.1-magnitude quake, which killed at least 64 people.
   The toll is already mounting: Santa Cruz County officials
reported 37 new complaints of physical and sexual abuse after the
quake, double the normal rate. Three women, an unusually high
number, were reported raped in Santa Cruz the week after the quake.
In hard-hit Watsonville, at least two women have been publicly
beaten by their husbands in the tent cities. The number of battered
women seeking shelter at San Francisco's Rosalie House is up 20
percent since the quake. Calls to the Southern Alameda County
Domestic Violence Law Project in Hayward have tripled.
   Throughout the region there are reports of people afraid to
return to their homes.
   Suicide Prevention Inc. of San Francisco reported twice as many
calls as usual in the past week, with 90 percent related to the
quake.
   Mental health experts say the best therapy is for everyone in
the area to talk openly about the earthquake.
   The apparent rise in domestic violence may stem from feelings of
hopelessness that a natural disaster can generate, said Dr. Etta
Bryant of the California Psychiatric Society in San Francisco.
   Post-traumatic stress disorders, usually associated with war
experiences and often taking months to appear, are also expected to
increase, she said.
   Among the hardest hit people were the concrete and steel
workers, who busted through the Interstate 880 roadway to expose
vehicles that time and again contained mangled bodies, said
Williams, from Aurora, Colo., who spoke to a fortuitously-timed
Society for Traumatic Stress Studies convention here over the
weekend.
   The Veterans Administration sent stress counselors to the Nimitz
highway, to help the former soldiers talk through their feelings,
Williams said.
   The convention, planned a year ago, brought 500 experts in
stress management to the Bay area. They fanned out to disaster
sites, suicide prevention centers and talked to people at
businesses.
   People in the region have swung rapidly through a gamut of
strong emotions including shock, excitement and euphoria at being
alive, Williams said.
   ``Now there is exhaustion,'' Williams said. ``They are feeling a
little helpless as reality is sinking in.''

<HEAD>Dollar, Tokyo Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices also fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
sluggish trading.
   The dollar ended the day's trading at 142.17 yen, down 0.58 yen
from Friday's close of 142.75 yen. It opened at 141.70 yen and
ranged between 141.70 and 142.38 yen. The dollar closed at 141.70
yen in New York on Friday.
   Currency dealers said dollar-buying by institutional investors
in Japan and Southeast Asia was helping to shore up the dollar
against selling pressure.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said market players are awaiting a spate of U.S.
economic data, including the country's advance economic indicators
for September, due out Tuesday, and the October employment figures,
due Friday.
   A lack of market-moving news and uncertainty over trends in the
stock market kept the market fairly quiet, said Kaneo Ogino of
Goldman Sachs.
   ``It depends on the stock market. Whatever happens there, the
dollar will follow,'' Ogino said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 151.90 points Friday, shed another 109.85
points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 35,417.44.
   Profit taking pushed the Nikkei average 141.30 points lower
early in the day but it recovered somewhat later on buying of
domestic demand-related issues like construction and fuel shares,
said Wako Securities dealer Shingo Takahashi.
   Only 600 million shares changed hands, down from 1.24 billion
shares Friday.
   Investors, who took profits Friday, remained on the sidelines
today due to uncertainty in the foreign exchange market and the New
York stock market, traders said.
   Fading expectations for lower interest rates kept investors away
from real estate shares, which notably advanced last week, said
Takamori Matsuda, an analyst at Dresdner-ABD Securities.

<HEAD>Minorities Twice As Likely to be Crime Victims, Justice Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks and Hispanics were about twice as
likely to be crime victims as whites last year, according to the
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   While whites were robbed at the rate of 4.7 per 1,000 people
during 1988, the rate for blacks was 9.4 and for Hispanics, 10.1,
said the bureau's National Crime Survey released Sunday.
   Males, young people, inner-city residents and renters also were
more likely to have been crime victims last year.
   The rates of violent crimes and personal thefts increased last
year for the second straight year but remained below the high rates
of the 1970s and early 1980s, the bureau said.
   The bureau said those two categories of crimes rose 3.1 percent
last year from 1987.
   Crime rates were highest in the West _ 126 personal crimes per
1,000 persons and 224 household crimes per 1,000 households. The
Northeast had the lowest rates _ 73 personal crimes per 1,000 and
115 household crimes per 1,000.
   The National Crime Survey figures for 1988 were based on
interviews with 101,000 people 12 years or older in 50,000 homes.

   Venus and the crescent moon will make a
brilliant pair in the evening sky Thursday, offering delightful
viewing if the weather is clear.
   The planet Venus is the brightest ``star'' in the sky, and will
be visible in the southwest as night falls.
   It will be shining close to the thin crescent moon, making for a
dramatic view, reports Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine.
   Millions of people went outdoors to watch a similar event in the
spring of 1988, according to the popular astronomy magazine.
   At sunset, the planet will appear to the right of the crescent
moon. Also visible should be Saturn, to the upper left, though it
will be much fainter.
   With luck, the magazine adds, viewers may be able to observe the
phenomenon of ``earthshine.''
   That is the reflected light from the Earth brightening the
normally dark portion of the moon so it becomes visible, although
not as bright as the crescent portion which is lighted by sunlight.
   Because the dark section of the moon glows dimly gray when this
occurs, it has been called ``the old moon in the new moon's arms.''
   Though Venus and the moon look close together at this time, they
are really more than 65 million miles apart.

   Moslem and Christian leaders want to work for
the freedom of Western hostages held by extremists in Beirut, says
an Ohio congresswoman who defied the State Department with an
unsanctioned trip to Lebanon.
   Democratic Rep. Mary Rose Oakar and Rep. Nick Rahll, D-W.Va.,
returned Sunday from meetings with Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun, whose forces control East Beirut, and acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss in Moslem West Beirut.
   In both Saturday meetings the lawmakers discussed vehicles for
peace in Lebanon and freedom for the 18 Western hostages.
   Oakar said she reminded the Lebanese leaders that Friday was the
fifth birthday in captivity for America's longest-held hostage,
Terry Anderson.
   ``I brought him up at both the meetings with the major leaders
and they pledged to help,'' she said in an interview.
   Hoss told the U.S. lawmakers the taking of hostages ``was a
gross violation of human rights ... He said on a daily basis
they're trying to pave the way for their return,'' Oakar said.
   ``Gen. Aoun said that if he could ... he would root those people
out and never let it happen again,'' she said.
   ``One thing that they both said was that they feel terrible ...
that people think hostage-taking is synonymous with the Lebanese
people,'' Oakar said. ``They regret that the world opinion is such
that people don't make a distinction'' between hostage-taking
pro-Iranian extremists and other Lebanese.

<HEAD>Two Journalists Wounded Hours After Drug Suspect Extradited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attackers on a motorcycle shot and
wounded two journalists in front of a television studio just hours
after a purported cocaine kingpin was sent to the United States to
be prosecuted.
   No group claimed responsibility for Sunday's shooting in the
capital, but it appeared to be yet another response by cocaine
barons to the government's extradition of accused drug traffickers
to the United States.
   Jose Abello Silva, the Medellin cocaine cartel's reputed master
smuggler, was handed over to U.S. narcotics agents before dawn
Sunday at a Bogota airport and then flown to Tulsa, Okla. to face
drug charges, U.S. authorities said.
   He was the fifth and most important drug-trafficking suspect
extradited to the United States since the Colombian government
began an all-out war on drug gangs 10 weeks ago. Eight more
suspects are being held for extradition.
   In Sunday's attack, the two gunmen on a motorcycle shot Jorge
Enrique Pulido, producer of the news program ``Mundo Vision,'' and
newswoman Ximena Godoy as they got into a car after leaving the
studio, police said.
   Pulido, 45, was shot twice in the shoulder and once in the
throat, and Ms. Godoy, 22, was hit in the leg, a police spokesman
said. Both were in stable condition at a Bogota hospital.
   Police said they captured one suspect and he was being
questioned.
   Pulido and Ms. Godoy were the ninth and 10th news industry
employees shot since the government began its crackdown in August
after the assassination of a leading presidential candidate. The
other eight died.
   In the week after the crackdown began, a group of drug
traffickers calling itself the Extraditables vowed in a letter sent
to a radio network to attack the country's journalists and public
figures.
   Since then, the offices of two newspapers have been bombed.
   Police said four bombs exploded in different locations in Bogota
on Sunday night, causing damage but no casualties.
   Twenty-two people have been killed and 220 injured over the past
10 weeks in at least 175 bombings, which the government blames on
traffickers.
   In Tulsa, U.S. Attorney Tony Graham said Abello pleaded innocent
to charges of conspiracy and distribution of cocaine during his
arraignment before a federal judge There was no discussion of bond.
   Graham said Abello would remain in the custody of the U.S.
Marshals Service pending another hearing Thursday.
   ``The arrest and extradition of Abello Silva represent a
significant step in the federal anti-drug offensive,'' acting
Marshals Service Director John J. Twomey said in a statement
released in Washington.
   Cornelius Dougherty, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, said Abello ``was considered a major transporter
for the Medellin cartel.''
   Abello was arrested Oct. 10 in a Bogota restaurant. Police said
he had undergone plastic surgery to avoid detection.
   He was indicted by a federal grand jury in Tulsa on Sept. 2,
1987, along with Florida stock broker Frank Palmero. Palmero later
was convicted on drug distribution charges and sentenced to 16
years in prison.
   The U.S. indictment accuses Abello of involvement in a
conspiracy to ship more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine and 6,200
pounds of marijuana to the United States.
   While Abello is the most important drug trafficking suspect
snared so far in the drug crackdown, he does not figure in the U.S.
Justice Department's list of the 12 most wanted traffickers.
Colombia has not captured any of those suspects, who include the
leaders of the Medellin and Cali cartels.
   The two gangs are said by U.S. officials to be responsible for
smuggling at least 300 tons of cocaine into the United States each
year.

<HEAD>DC Murder Toll Equals 1988 Record, With Two Months to Go</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia's 1989 homicide toll
already equals last year's record of 369 killings _ with more than
half blamed on drug-related violence _ and officials say they see
no end in sight.
   With two months remaining in 1989, district police reported that
five slayings discovered during a seven-hour period over the
weekend brought the tally to last year's record death total.
   Three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs. The other
two were a 13-year-old girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to
death in their apartment Saturday.
   Police blame more than 60 percent of the district's slayings on
drugs, particularly the arrival of crack cocaine.
   The federal government is making the nation's capital a test
case for national anti-drug strategies, and city police are working
long hours trying to curb drug-related violence.
   ``It's awful. But people in this community are resorting to
deadly violence to resolve conflict,'' said police spokesman Lt.
Reginald Smith.
   The most recent victim of the weekend was a 41-year-old man
found dead of multiple gunshot wounds early Sunday. He had $11,000
cash and a large quantity of heroin in his pockets when his body
was found, according to police detectives.
   At the end of 1988, police had said 372 people were killed in
homicides, but they revised that number downward Sunday by
subtracting three victims of police shootings from the official
total.
   D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, whose political fortunes are slipping
partly because the murder rate is skyrocketing, calls the problem
``unstoppable.''
   National Drug Policy Coordinator William J. Bennett acknowledged
recently that the district's drug and crime problem _ the focus of
special attention from his office _ will be difficult to solve.
   ``No one should be surprised to learn that the nation's capital
is still plagued by a serious drug problem,'' Bennett said while
reviewing federal efforts in the district's drug war. ``The
drug-related murder rate is intolerably high, the prisons are too
crowded, drugs continue to be sold openly around schools, parks and
housing projects.''
   Bennett has lent federal prison space, special agents and
investigative tools to the city's anti-drug effort, and city police
have been working 12-hour shifts patrolling drug-infested
neighborhoods and housing projects.
   But on Friday, President Bush vetoed the city's annual spending
bill, delaying a special $32 million federal anti-crime package.
   By vetoing the bill because it would allow the city to use local
tax money to finance Medicaid abortions for poor women, Bush put on
hold a plan to hire 700 extra police, eight new judges, and a host
of school-based anti-drug educational programs.
   ``We're going to have to study whether to cut out overtime,''
Police Chief Isaac Fulwood said after the veto. ``Certainly, we
need to rethink purchasing strategies, and slow them down ... This
certainly won't help fight crime.''
   Most city officials feel that until the city's appetite for
drugs subsides, there is little they can do.
   ``The large percentage of the killings are related to the drug
scene, and in many cases ... hits that are put out in arguments
over turf,'' said Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley. ``We can delay
them, but as long as the drug market is still thriving, those
targeted killings are probably going to continue.''
   Fulwood, who has contradicted Barry's negative view of the
murder situation, said the situation isn't as bleak as the mayor
suggested.
   ``We are making some progress, and there are some things that
are positive,'' Fulwood said. ``The number of killings, per day, is
decreasing. It's still too high, but we are going in the right
direction.''
   According to police statistics, 49 people were killed in the
nation's capital during August, 32 in September, and 34 in October.
Still, the September and October figures represent a murder a day.

   Animal rights activists figure they got the
last laugh on nightclub operators who offered a full-length raccoon
coat as a prize in an Elvira look-alike contest: A protester won
the contest wearing a costume donated by the real Elvira.
   ``This is going to be one less fur on the street,'' said Aileen
Linhard of Animal Care and Welfare, after fellow activist Jeanie
Brown, 38, of Pittsburgh won the contest Saturday at Nikki's, a
club in this Pittsburgh suburb.
   About 35 people protested outside while 350 watched the contest.
   Cassandra Peterson _ an animal rights activist who adopts the
Elvira persona on late-night television in a low-cut black dress _
donated the winning costume to a group called Mobilization for
Animals.
   At one point, an activist who infiltrated the audience at
Nikki's yelled, ``Elvira hates furs.''
   Ms. Browne didn't say what the fate of the coat would be.
   Club manager Nick A. Veltri said he thought she entered the
contest under false pretenses, but still planned to turn over the
fur.
   ``Whatever she does with it is her business,'' he said.

   One man's garden can be another's
eyesore, especially when the landscaping is a 6-foot-tall,
front-yard patch of wildflowers.
   Some residents of this tony Cleveland suburb want Joseph
Gyurgyik's lawn returned to a more traditional decor, particularly
now, as the once-colorful display is turning brown and wilting.
   ``I think it's an absolute eyesore,'' said neighbor Carolyn
Wallace.
   The city's Architectural Board of Review has declared the
display in violation of a ban on inappropriate landscaping, but
Gyurgyik said he will fight that ruling and any others.
   The controversy has prompted city officials to try to tighten up
the definition of what's appropriate in matters floral.
   ``It's like defining obscenity,'' said David Goss, a councilman
and member of the city Board of Zoning Appeals. ``That's a
community standard, really.''
   But Gyurgyik says he's gotten many compliments on his tangle of
50 to 75 varieties of domestic and wild flowers, including poppies,
cosmos, and black-eyed Susans. He says his neighbors are just being
stuffy.
   ``They like to have everything under control,'' he said. ``If it
moves, spray it.''
   There's also a practical side to the unusual garden, Gyurgyik
admits: ``The last thing I want to do after working 12 hours, six
days a week, is come home and cut a lawn.''

   Pumpkin festivals are sprouting in some school districts, where
parents are trying to keep Halloween out of the hallways and off
school grounds because of its connection with witches and Satan.
   In Alachua County, Fla., Robert Guyer gathered the signatures of
about 200 fellow parents who think the holiday is a religious
celebration of Wicca, a modern pagan witchcraft cult.
   When teachers dress up like witches, ``what happens to these
little Christian kids like mine?'' asked Guyer, a University of
Florida law student. ``How are they going to feel when it's
dress-up day and they don't dress up?''
   Officials in Alachua County left the decision on Halloween to
school principals.
   In neighboring Levy County, the superintendent asked schools to
avoid using Halloween decorations and to cancel school celebrations.
   Halloween, which is being celebrated Tuesday night, apparently
sprang from an ancient ceremony honoring the Celtic god of death.
In medieval England, it came to be known as All Hallows' Eve,
celebrated before the feast day of All Hallows, now All Saints'
Day. As is the case with the pagan Christmas tree, few pay
attention to its religious origins.
   But Guyer cites a recent 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling in Atlanta that found that prayers before high school
football games violate the constitutional separation of church and
state.
   ``As Easter has been banned in favor of spring holiday, as
Christmas has been banned in favor of winter holiday, so, too,
Halloween should be banned in favor of fall holiday,'' he said.
   The Rev. Bill Ligon of Brunswick, Ga., agreed: ``Some of the
symbolism used for Halloween is used also by recognized religions.
I think the law as interpreted by the 11th Circuit should be
impartially applied to any religious activity at school.''
   Halloween's defenders say it has become a non-religious holiday.
   ``The witches and goblins of Halloween are no more believable
than Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy. ... Are they
going to ban those, too?''asked Charley Mack, a father of six in
Tallahassee, Fla., where several schools are inaugurating ``harvest
festivals'' in place of Halloween.
   In Texas, Harlingen Superintendent T. Carl McMillan responded to
parents' anxieties by asking principals to tone down celebrations.
   ``I asked them to review their practices and if they had
anything that depicted blood and gore to try to eliminate that,''
McMillan said.
   An elementary school in Amarillo planned to celebrate Pumpkin
Fun Day rather than Halloween.
   And in Frederick County, Md., three elementary schools have
discontinued Halloween events. At least one decided to hold a fall
celebration instead.
   ``I personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our
instructional curriculum,'' said John Thompson, a county school
official.
   Parents are upset by lurid descriptions of devil worship on
television and in rock music, said Fred Eisenbraun of the Rapid
City Cops for Christ, in South Dakota.
   Eisenbraun was in Worthington, Minn., last week to conduct an
Occult Awareness Seminar for teachers, parents and teen-agers.
   ``Satanists do not isolate themselves to New York, to Denver or
to Dallas,'' Eisenbraun said. ``They like rural areas, like
Worthington, Minnesota, or Rapid City, South Dakota, where there's
an availability of abandoned buildings, animals, and wide-open
areas where there aren't enough cops to check on them.''
   The popularity of slasher movies and costumes that imitate them
worry other parents.
   Movies like ``Halloween'' and ``Friday the 13th,'' are popular
enough to make their protagonists among the hottest-selling
costumes this year, outfitters say _ along with Batman and Jim and
Tammy Bakker.
   But Freddy Krueger, the ogre of Elm Street, isn't invited to the
Halloween party at the Bethesda Elementary School in Waukesha, Wis.
Students there were forbidden from dressing as characters in any of
the graphically violent movies, said Principal Nancy Marsho.
   ``We don't appreciate Freddy here at Bethesda,'' Ms. Marsho said.

<HEAD>Opposition Activists Say Their Movement is Growing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition activists heartened by
their biggest protest in years say their movement is growing but
that most people still don't seem to want to risk what comforts
they have by getting involved.
   In Saturday's protest, more than 10,000 people gathered in
Wenceslas Square to mark the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak
independence. Police beat several dozen people and arrested 355,
including 17 foreigners.
   The demonstrators called repeatedly for free elections, a new
government, and the resignation of Communist Party leader Milos
Jakes. His popularity is said by informed Czechs to be sliding even
within Communist ranks.
   The rally was the first in which such strident calls for a new
leadership were heard.
   ``Our (leadership) power is much more isolated after the changes
in East Germany,'' noted Jiri Hajek, a former foreign minister and
now a leading activist with the Charter 77 human rights group. ``It
is still strong and monolithic in Czechoslovakia, but they feel
more alone.''
   The conviction that change is coming has grown markedly in
Prague in the last two months, buoyed by the dramatic upheaval in
East Germany, the emergence of a non-Communist government in Poland
and Hungary's bold moves toward democracy.
   But Czechoslovaks have not suffered the privations endured by
Polish, Hungarian and East German consumers, and many apparently
are unwilling to risk economic problems in exchange for political
change.
   Fear of losing material possessions coveted and gained by many
Czechs and Slovaks _ a car, a country cottage, a videocassette
player _ is the great brake on popular protest, said dissident
Vaclav Maly, a Roman Catholic priest.
   In addition, the government in the past year has loosened
restrictions on travel to the West and permitted freer expression
in the arts.
   To date, there has been no stimulus to mass protest like in East
Germany, where more than 50,000 people have fled to the West since
August. With a tradition of caution and peaceful change, many
Czechs and Slovaks are not convinced that street demonstrations are
the way to achieve reform.
   This caution makes them wary of striking out for change while
they perceive no strong leadership in the 30-odd opposition groups.
Banned playwright and activist Vaclav Havel is virtually the only
nationally known figure in the ragged movement.
   Moreover, Czechs and Slovaks for centuries have resisted their
rulers from other, larger nations with wit and ridicule, rather
than arms.
   ``Czechs are able to resist, but not to sacrifice so much,''
Maly said. ``We struggled spiritually.''
   The shock of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion to crush Prague
spring reforms is also deeply etched in the memory of
Czechoslovaks, said Dana Nemcova of Charter 77.
   ``People really hoped then and then suddenly suffered a blow,''
she noted. The ensuing two decades of ``normalization,'' as it is
officially known, have left many citizens very skeptical about
change.
   ``The people are very discontented but feel powerless,'' she
said. ``They don't think words can change anything _ they've heard
so many words .... But especially young people are active, and they
have decided to struggle for their future.''
   Prague abounds with talk of mini-revolts inside the only two
parties officially permitted by the ruling Communists, the People's
Party and the Socialist Party.
   In the past, these two parties ``were instruments of the
Communist party,'' noted Maly. Now with calls for genuine democracy
appearing in both parties and in their daily newspapers, ``that is
not so true.''

<HEAD>Indian Summer Continues in East; Rain, Clouds Across Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian summer was expected to linger for another day through
much of the East today, while a cold front stretching from Texas
north through the nation's midsection brings rain and perhaps some
snow.
   A high-wind warning was posted for this morning in Southern
California, where brushfires on Sunday chased 2,200 campers from
campgrounds in the mountains north of Los Angeles and closed a
stretch of the scenic Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu.
Firefighters were helped late Sunday by diminishing winds.
   New Englanders and New York state residents who have enjoyed
seven straight days of mild, sunny Indian summer weather were
advised to leave the overcoats home again today _ the forecast was
for clear skies and temperatures in the 60s and 70s.
   A mild, 70-degee day was in store for the mid-Atlantic states as
well, but forecasters warned clouds could creep in tonight. Rain
could reach New England from the north tonight or Tuesday, the
National Weather Service said.
   Meanwhile, a cold front stretching south from Wisconsin was
expected to bring cold rain to much of the Midwest today and
Tuesday. Snow flurries are possible in the upper Plains states.
   That follows a weekend bout of showers and storms that dumped
two-inch hail on some spots in Texas and Oklahoma and snow flurries
from South Dakota through southeast Colorado.

<HEAD>Rebels Reportedly Take Town With Unified Force; Indication Feuds
Ending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrilla factions have united to
capture a major government garrison in central Afghanistan, raising
fears in the military that rebel factions are ending feuds, a
government source and witnesses said today.
   Divisions have hurt the U.S-backed guerrillas in their campaign
to topple the Kabul government after the last Soviet troops pulled
out in February.
   However, a source in the Moscow-supported government, quoted
military officials as saying officers were worried that the
fractious rebels are now beginning to join forces.
   Several guerrillas factions reportedly fought together to
capture the south-central city of Sore Kallin. The city is the
hometown of the late Noor Mohammad Taraki, founder of the ruling
Democratic People's Party of Afghanistan and the country's first
Communist ruler.
   Thousands of rebels attacked the Ghazni province city last week,
according to the government source and two truck drivers who
arrived in Kabul from the region today.
   By Friday, rebel forces had routed the 3,000-member government
garrison, they said. The truck drivers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, reported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded but said they
knew nothing of government casualties.
   Rebels captured many government weapons, including thousands of
AK-47 assault rifles, hand grenades and mortars, the government
source said.
   Taraki set up the garrison after he seized power in an April
1978 coup that touched off the country's civil war. Although Taraki
was ousted and killed in another coup in September 1979, the
garrison had remained among the strongest in Ghazni province, the
government source said.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said rebels
have been trying to knock out the garrison for several years. ``The
victory was the result of their unity,'' he said.
   One truck driver said that after the rebel victory, several
mullahs, or Moslem clergymen, were hung upside down from trucks
after they were accused of supporting the government.
   The government source said cooperation by separate guerrilla
forces on a blockade of the government's main supply route from the
Soviet Union also indicated new unity among rebel factions.
   He said forces loyal to Ahmad Shah Massoud and others led by
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar had been co-ordinating the 10-day blockade on
the Salang Highway, the northern route out of Kabul.
   The source said Massoud, a relatively liberal Moslem, had not
previously united forces with Hekmatyar, a fundamentalist Moslem.
   Rebels have also been blockading the three others highways out
of Kabul, the capital, according to private truckers.
   The blockade was forcing up food prices and raising fears of
shortages. More than 2,000 trucks were said to be stuck on Salang
Highway north of the fighting.
   In addition, the rebels also stepped up rocketing on the
capital's airport. Soldiers said at least six rockets crashed down
there in the early morning today, but no casualties were reported.
   However, they said air shipments from the Soviet Union were
slowing down to about 10 a day from the usual 30.
   Government officials have said if land and air routes are shut,
the capital would be able to survive for about one month. Silos
holding about 50,000 tons of flour are said to be full, and the
government has also stockpiled gasoline.

   A Delta Air Lines jetliner returned to
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport shortly after takeoff when
an engine failed and shot off sparks that witnesses said ignited
grass fires.
   ``It looked like a Roman candle,'' said Irving resident Mike
Sullivan, who saw the Boeing 727 while walking his dog. ``It left a
streak of sparks in the sky. There were large chunks flying off of
it.''
   Flight 691 was bound for Denver with 94 passengers and a crew of
seven Sunday night when one of its three engines failed shortly
after takeoff, said Delta spokesman Bill Holland.
   No injuries were reported, officials said.
   Sparks coming from the failed engine ignited several grass fires
in an open field near the airport, witnesses told the Irving Fire
Department. Firefighters controled the blazes within an hour.
   ``It was shooting off sparks and then it seemed to diminish,''
Sullivan said.
   Fire officials could not immediately confirm what started the
fires. The Irving fire marshal was expected to investigate the
blazes today, said dispatcher Gerard Thompson.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials said the plane would
remain at airport today while investigators attempt to identify the
cause of the failure.
   Airport operation crews closed the runway and found several
engine parts, including what appeared to be pieces of turbine fan
blades, scattered along the runway, said airport spokesman Joe
Dealey Jr.
   ``There was a failure in the engine, causing the parts to
scatter,'' Holland said, although he did not know whether the
engine had caught on fire. ``When the pilot saw he had the problem,
he circled the field and returned.''
   The plane took off at 7:19 p.m. and returned at 7:37 p.m. The
plane taxied to an airport terminal under its own power, said
Dealey.
   Shortly after the aircraft took off, three grass fires were
reported in Irving, about three miles southeast of the airport.
   The Irving Fire Department responded at 7:29 p.m. to the first
report of a grass fire and sent at least four units to the scene,
Thompson said.
   John Nash, 80, of Denver, a passenger on the plane, said he
first knew something was wrong when he heard a loud noise about
five minutes into the flight.
   ``It was a pretty doggone loud noise _ like somebody fired a
cannon or something,'' Nash said. ``Before that there were several
other noises.''
   Passengers boarded another plane that left for Denver at 9:58
p.m., Holland said.

<HEAD>Busing a Major Issue in Seattle's Mayoral Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-busing initiative figures strongly in the
Nov. 7 mayoral election that will result in either the city's first
black or first Republican mayor in more than two decades.
   Polls have shown strong support for Initiative 34, which is
backed by Republican Doug Jewett. They also give a slight edge to
his opponent, City Councilman Norm Rice, who is against the measure.
   Rice, 46, would be the first black mayor in a city where blacks
comprise only about 10 percent of the population.
   ``If I win, it's going to say that people in Seattle recognize
how hard people work and how well they do their jobs,'' Rice said.
   Jewett, the 42-year-old city attorney, would be the first
Republican to win the non-partisan office since Dorm Braman in 1965.
   The anti-busing measure asks, but does not require, the
independently elected and budgeted city School Board to switch from
a ``controlled choice'' attendance plan that requires busing of
about 10 percent of the 40,000 students for racial balance to a
completely open enrollment system.
   In exchange for abandoning mandatory busing, schools would get
about $4.5 million in annual sales tax revenue that now goes to the
city, with that money reserved for ``magnet'' programs designed to
encourage racial balance.
   Jewett and Rice finished one-two among 13 candidates in
September's primary.
   Rice has trumpeted his Democratic credentials, including
endorsements from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gov. Booth Gardner, U.S.
Rep. Jim McDermott, and outgoing Mayor Charles Royer, who decided
not to run for a fourth term.
   A random telephone survey of 400 likely voters taken Oct. 13-16
for KIRO-TV and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, showed Rice leading
by 46-39 percent with the rest undecided.
   In the poll, which had a 4.8 point margin of error, 46 percent
favored the initiative, 32 percent were opposed and the rest
undecided.
   Many observers believe the Washington Supreme Court did Rice a
favor by refusing to strike the initiative from the ballot.
Opponents claimed the initiative violated the state Constitution,
but the court decided to hear that claim only if the measure were
passed.
   As a result, the overwhelmingly Democratic electorate can reject
busing while voting for Rice.
   Rice sees crime as the top issue. Jewett says the schools are
tops in his campaign but he accuses the news media of downplaying
his positions on crime, growth and other issues.
   Jewett helped draft the measure and has been its leading
advocate. City council and school board members generally are
opposed.
   So is Rice, who says the plan is racist in effect if not in
intent. He rejects suggestions that Jewett is racially biased.
   On Oct. 9, Rice announced his own plan for assuring racial
balance in schools with magnet programs, stronger city support for
education and incentives for housing integration. The plan would
eliminate any need for mandatory busing within four years, he said.
   Jewett promptly accused his opponent of a near-flip-flop to woo
voters.
   ``The political issue is that of leadership,'' he said.
``They've watched Norm Rice go from adamant opposition to ending
mandatory busing to embracing it.'
   Rice admits a considerable change of heart ``because of what
busing does to working families'' but said that if nothing else
keeps the schools racially balanced, mandatory measures must
continue.
   ``I still think that integrated, quality education is important
to the future of America,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Chinese police arrested four leaders of a
dissident group that was active in the pro-democracy movement and
worked to set up an underground armed force, an official Chinese
report said today.
   The report indicates Chinese authorities are continuing the
crackdown on people involved in the protests that swept the nation
last spring.
   The ``Chongqing Patriotic Democracy League'' in Sichuan province
of southwestern China was formed May 21 after martial law was
declared in Beijing, the official China News Service said in a
report appearing in Hong Kong.
   Police arrested the group's leader, Dai Weiping, and three other
key members, the news service said. The brief report did not say
when the arrests were made.
   The report from Chongqing called the organization a
``counterrevolutionary group,'' a label that Chinese officials have
been using for the pro-democracy protests.
   The news service said league members participated in illegal
marches supporting the student-led protests in Beijing, gave
reactionary speeches, and incited turmoil.
   After Chinese troops crushed the pro-democracy movement in
Beijing on June 4, the league remained active by calling secret
meetings and scheming to steal guns to set up an underground
fighting force, the report said.
   Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed during the military's
June assault in the capital.
   Today's report also claimed that the league tried to get foreign
support, but did not elaborate.
   The South China Morning Post, an English-language newspaper in
Hong Kong, quoted unidentified analysts in Sichuan as saying they
believed the league was an organization of workers, including the
unemployed.
   China annnounced thousands of arrests at the beginning of the
crackdown. However, few arrests have been publicized recently,
probably reflecting in part government sensitivity over foreign
criticism.

   Rescuers rappelled 60 feet down a tow cable
into an icy mountain river to rescue a month-old girl from a car
that plunged off a road and was mostly submerged for 45 minutes.
   The infant's mother and grandparents were killed in the crash
Sunday at Independence Pass, said Pitkin County Sheriff's spokesman
Steve Crockett.
   The victims, Omard and Marjorie Harrison of Houston, and their
daughter, Kary Venable, 19, of Kingwood, Texas, had hitchhiked a
ride with two teen-age girls after their van was disabled in an
accident on state Highway 82 outside this ski resort town, Crockett
said. The teens survived.
   The car slid off the snowy highway and down a 60-foot cliff into
a stretch of the Roaring Fork River called ``Devil's Punchbowl.''
   The first volunteer firefighters on the scene spotted the car,
upside down and up to its wheels in the frigid water, Crockett
said. The used a truck-mounted winch to pull the car near the
shore, then two of the volunteers, Dr. Steve Ayers and Rick Dean,
rappelled down the tow cable and pulled month-old Samantha Venable
from the car.
   The child was in critical condition today at St. Mary's Hospital
in Grand Junction, a nursing supervisor said.
   The driver, Britt Rosen, 17, of Aspen, and her passenger, Maelle
Deschutter, 16, of Snowmass Village, managed to kick out the car's
front windows and escape to hail a passing motorist, Crockett said.
Ms. Rosen was treated for hypothermia and Ms. Deschutter for a
broken arm.
   Harrison, 64, and Mrs. Harrison, 61, were found dead in the back
seat, Crockett said. A dog also was killed.

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices rose as
much as $4.25 an ounce.
   Currency dealers said trading was calm, and the market's
attention had shifted to cross-currency trading.
   They said the dollar moved up from its lows of late Friday on
short-covering, but that interest in dollar trading was minimal.
   ``It's very quiet so far this morning,'' said one trader in
Rome. ``I don't see much space for the dollar to decline.''
   The Bank of England reportedly intervened in the market to prop
up the British pound, which fell last week following Nigel Lawson's
resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
   At midmorning, it cost $1.5715 to buy one pound, cheaper for
buyers than $1.5750 late Friday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.8350 West German marks, up from 1.8300
   _1.6053 Swiss francs, up from 1.6005
   _6.2318 French francs, up from 6.2190
   _2.0713 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820
   _1,345.50 Italian lire, up from 1,342.00
   _1.1745 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1746
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.58 yen to a closing 142.17 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 142.05 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $379 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $374.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $378.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $377, up from $373 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.46 to close at a bid of
$378.75.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.27 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $5.19.

<HEAD>U.S., Vietnam Agree To Expand Work On Missing U.S. Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam and the United States have
agreed to expand joint efforts to resolve the cases of about 1,700
American soldiers missing from the Vietnam War, an official report
said today.
   The agreement was reached after two days of talks in Hanoi
between U.S. presidential envoy John W. Vessey Jr. and Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach, said the official Voice of Vietnam radio.
   It quoted a joint communique as saying the two sides agreed ``to
refine and extend the process of joint cooperation to resolve the
compelling cases of discrepancies, including conducting additional
research to determine the fate of these Americans.''
   ``Discrepancy cases'' are those to which the United States has
assigned highest priority. They are cases it says the Vietnamese
should have information on, including instances where U.S. airmen
are believed to have parachuted to safety but were never heard from.
   The broadcast did not give details of how the efforts would be
expanded.
   U.S. and Vietnamese specialists are now halfway into their
eighth joint field investigation. These have involved such work as
interviewing villagers living near sites where U.S. warplanes
crashed.
   The war ended in 1975 with the defeat of the south by the
Communist north.
   The communique said the U.S. side expressed appreciation for
progress on programs to resettle Vietnamese in the United States,
including half-American children and former inmates of political
``re-education camps.''
   ``Both sides agreed to continue efforts to sustain the current
high level of cooperation on these important programs,'' it said.
   It said Vessey repeated a U.S. commitment to encourage the
efforts by non-governmental U.S. organizations to help Vietnam with
its humanitarian problems, including those involving disabled
people and children.
   In previous talks, the United States has refused to discuss
non-humanitarian questions.
   However, the communique said Vessey and Thach also exchanged
views on Cambodia, where a Vietnamese-installed government is
fighting guerrillas supported by the United States.
   Vessey traveled to Hanoi with senior state and defense
department officials and Ann Mills Griffiths, the head of the
private National League of Families of American Prisioners And
Missing In Southeast Asia.
   It was his second mission to Vietnam as presidential envoy. His
August 1987 trip resulted in Vietnam's agreement to speed up work
on humanitarian issues and a U.S. promise to encourage
non-governmental aid to Vietnam.
   The Vietnamese seek American diplomatic recognition to end their
isolation from the non-Communist world and bring in badly needed
economic assistance.
   They have complained that the United States has failed to move
in that direction since Vietnam in late September withdrew what it
called its last 26,000 troops from Cambodia. Washington had called
the action a prerequisite for establishing relations.
   However, Washington is now demanding that Vietnam work toward
reaching a political settlement to the war in Cambodia.

   Finance Minister Shimon Peres went home today
after two weeks in the hospital for treatment of a urinary tract
infection.
   Peres, who is also the vice premier and leads the center-left
Labor Party, said he will attend a meeting of Israel's top Cabinet
leaders Wednesday if there is discussion of a peace proposal by
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The finance minister criticized demands for changes in Baker's
plan by the right-wing Likud bloc, Labor's partner in the coalition
Cabinet.
   In a telephone interview with Israel Radio after leaving Haemek
Hospital in Afula, Peres said Israel should accept Baker's call for
Israeli talks with a Palestinian delegation to advance an Israeli
plan for elections in the occupied territories.
   But Peres said the government's response does not have to be
given before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the Likud
bloc, travels to the United States in mid-November.
   Peres, 66, will spend several days resting at home. He was
hospitalized after he complained of feeling ill during a trip to
northern Israel.

   Anti-abortion activists accused their foes
of manipulating public opinion and their pro-choice counterparts
urged legislators to guard a woman's right to end a pregnancy
during weekend rallies that drew thousands.
   An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 anti-abortion activists rallied
and then marched to the Ohio Statehouse on Saturday. A day later, a
crowd estimated by police at between 10,000 and 15,000 marched past
the Statehouse to Bicentennial Park to rally in favor of legal
abortion.
   Both events were peaceful and no arrests were made.
   On Saturday, John C. Willke of Cincinnati, president of the
National Right to Life Society, blasted the opposition, saying a
reported upswing in support of the pro-choice movement was
manufactured by well-financed interests.
   ``Is it true there is a major pro-abortion tide? It sure doesn't
look like it,'' he said. ``There is a campaign around the country,
with a lot of money, and they're saying that America is changing
its opinion on the abortion issue.''
   Willke also questioned polls and surveys on the abortion issue,
calling them misleading.
   He cited a recent survey in which he said 67 percent of those
polled said they felt women should have the right to an abortion.
But he said 69 percent of the respondents, in response to a later
question in the same poll, also said the lives of unborn babies
should be protected.
   On Sunday, Gov. Richard Celeste, National Organization for Woman
President Molly Yard and Kate Michelman, head of the National
Abortion Rights Action League, led the pro-choice march carrying a
banner that said, ``Keep choice in your house, not the Statehouse.''
   ``I call upon our heavenly mother to forgive our opponents who
know not what they do,'' Ms. Yard told rally participants.
   ``Last night, we all turned out clocks back one hour ... but we
must not turn our clocks back one generation,'' Celeste told the
crowd.

<HEAD>Official: Flight 103 Bomb May Have Malta, Libyan Links</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators suspect a bomb that
destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 and killed 270 people may have
originated in Malta and that a Libyan may have been involved, a
West German official said today.
   London's Sunday Times first reported that the bomb came from
Malta, an island nation that has enjoyed good relations with the
government of radical Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   The report said the bomb was transferred from a Malta flight to
Flight 103 in Frankfurt inside a suitcase unaccompanied by a
passenger.
   The newspaper, which quoted airline personnel in Malta, also
reported Sunday that the suitcase carried clothing purchased in
Malta. It said investigators had traced the clothing to a store
where the shopkeeper remembered that a man he believed was Libyan
had bought them.
   Today, a spokesman for West Germany's federal criminal
investigations office in Wiesbaden confirmed the Maltese link and
said it was providing ``a hot trail'' for investigators.
   The Scottish detectives who are heading the investigation have
contended for several months that the bomb was put on the jet in
Frankfurt, where Flight 103 originated. Passengers and luggage were
transferred to a Boeing 747 at Heathrow Airport in London.
   All 259 people aboard and 11 residents on the ground were killed
when the bomb ripped apart the jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, on
Dec. 21.
   ``There are clues that a suitcase from Malta may have played a
part,'' said Willi Fundermann, a spokesman for the federal
investigations office.
   ``There are also clues that someone from Libya _ or at least
someone with a Libyan accent _ may have bought the items (of
clothing). Whether he also is the one who brought it (the suitcase)
on board is still not known at this time,'' Fundermann said in a
telephone interview.
   Scottish authorities have declined comment on any Malta
connection.
   No one has been charged in the bombing.
   There has long been speculation that a group of Palestinians
arrested in October in West Germany may have been behind the
attack, but Fundermann said there was no proof of that.
   He said the initial clue about a Malta connection came from an
``examination of the remains'' from the crash site. He did not
elaborate.
   The Sunday Times said the evidence was in a computer list of all
luggage put aboard Flight 103 in Frankfurt.

<HEAD>Two More Bodies Found In Wreckage Of Plastics Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers located two more bodies in the
massive steel and concrete debris of the Phillips Petroleum Co.
plastics plant early today, while the search continued for six
workers still missing.
   ``They were found in the area of the control room and the
finishing room,'' company spokesman Rob Phillips said.
   ``That's really where we expect to find the rest of the missing.
But we're talking about an area as big as a football field, so
there's still quite a lot of area to get through.''
   In the week since the plastics plant was ripped apart by a
series of explosions, 16 bodies have been recovered by crews
working around the clock. Only five bodies have been officially
identified.
   Phillips said the storm that dumped hail and up to 4 inches of
rain around Houston on Sunday helped rescue efforts by damping dust
from the rubble.
   ``The rain didn't really slow them down yesterday,'' Phillips
said today. ``It kept the dust down and the asbestos that is being
cleaned up and removed from the area from flying around. From what
I hear, we may get more rain today, so that could be good.''
   But the crews' search was hampered Sunday by a steel beam which
was hanging loosely 150 feet over a control room area where
rescuers believe they will find the missing bodies. Workers used a
crane to stabilize the beam.
   In addition to the two bodies found today, searchers working
over the weekend found six bodies Saturday and another on Sunday.
   Phillips spokesmen said 124 people were injured in the accident
and nine remained hospitalized late Sunday.
   The polyethylene plant produced almost 20 percent of the
nation's production of plastic pellets used in the manufacture of
milk jugs and grocery bags.
   Phillips officials believe flammable hydrocarbon vapor from
ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical
reactor, triggering Monday's blast. But they have said they don't
know how the gases were ignited.

   East Germany's new communist leader will travel to
Moscow within the next two days for talks with Kremlin officials on
political reform, Communist Party sources said Monday.
   Activists in Leipzig, where 300,000 people marched one week ago
in the largest such demonstration in East Germany's 40-year
history, said protesters would take to the streets again today to
up keep pressure for democratic reform.
   Demands for reform have reached a fevered pitch this month and
the government sponsored town meetings across the nation Sunday to
discuss change.
   At least 20,000 people attended the rally in East Berlin and
many jeered local officials and demanded explanations for misdeeds
and blunders.
   Party sources said Communist leader Egon Krenz would meet with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow to discuss the
course of reform talks now under way in East Germany.
   West Germany's ARD television network said Krenz would go to
Moscow on Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, a leader of East Germany's Liberal Democratic Party
charged that the nation's ``political structure no longer
corresponded to the will of the people.''
   Manfred Bogisch suggested in a commentary in his party's
newspaper, Der Morgen, that the Communist Party's leading role
would have to be won, not dictated.
   Although Bogisch reiterated that socialism was not at issue in
the reform debate, he said the communist leadership's policies are
`now a matter of debate.''
   ``Those who were responsible for the stagnation will have to
take responsibility for it,'' he said.
   The Liberal Democrats have been at the forefront of efforts to
create more political pluralism within East Germany's socialist
system.
   Under East Germany's constitution, all political parties are
aligned with the Communist Party. The Liberal Democrats have said
the parties should have more independence.
   East Germans have taken to the streets by the hundreds of
thousands this month to demand a more open society with free
elections, a free press and an end to one-party rule. Since
mid-September, more than 50,000 have fled to the West, many of them
young skilled workers.
   The Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland today described
weekend's rallies and protests as ``passionate and open, pugnacious
and constructive'' and made no effort to discourage future
demonstrations that have been drawing thousands to the streets each
night.
   But it also declared that recent events stem from advances in
socialism.
   Krenz has promised ``a new course'' for the country, including
freer travel to the West and an amnesty for people jailed for
trying to escape what has been a tightly-controlled society.
   Sunday's meeting in Berlin quickly turned into an emotional
forum, with speakers criticizing privileges accorded Communist
officials. They also accused police of brutality against peaceful
pro-democracy protesters earlier this month.
   Guenter Schabowski, East Berlin party chief and a member of the
country's ruling Politburo, drew applause when he announced his
support for ``approved and well-ordered'' demonstrations in the
city.
   Since Krenz took power Oct. 18 officials have launched an
unparalleled campaign of dialogue and openness aimed at winning
public trust. Many activists are skeptical, however, saying
Communist leaders are only interested in reforms that do not
challenge their monopoly on power.
   Communist officials in recent days have appealed to protesters
to attend government-organized dialogue sessions rather than take
to the streets.
   A member of the country's largest opposition group, New Forum,
was quoted in an interview with a West German newspaper Sunday as
saying street protests will continue as long as the government
refuses to recognize opposition groups.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury investigating former
lobbyist Craig T. Spence has heard testimony about late-night White
House tours, missing presidential china and Spence's interest in a
secret military counterterrorism unit, according to a published
report.
   The witness, who requested anonymity, described interviews last
Thursday with Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Strasser, Secret Service
agents and the grand jury in a story in today's editions of The
Washington Times.
   Spence also has been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury
but apparently has not yet appeared, the newspaper said.
   The U.S. Attorney's Office is investigating Spence's alleged
connection to a male prostitution ring that was raided by Secret
Service agents in February. The raid uncovered credit card receipts
indicating the ring brought in as much as $20,000 a month.
   The Secret Service also is investigating allegations that two
uniformed White House guards allowed Spence to take several
prostitutes on after-hours tours of the executive mansion.
   One guard reportedly has acknowledged receiving an expensive
watch from Spence and giving the lobbyist a piece of White House
china.
   ``They pulled out a picture book containing the White House
china collections and asked me about the Truman china,'' the
witness, identified as among those who took an unauthorized tour of
the White House on July 3, 1988, told the Times.
   ``They wanted to know if I had seen anything like that. They
strongly intimated that more things were missing.''
   Federal prosecutors asked the most detailed questions about the
tour, the witness was quoted as saying.
   The prosecutor also appeared to be investigating the use of
credit cards to procure prostitutes and trying to determine the
identity of a young man Spence had frequently introduced as his
son, the witness said.
   According to the Times, Strasser also asked the witness about
Spence's reported gift of an $8,000 Rolex watch to a member of the
armed services, whom Spence pressed for information on the Delta
Force, a Fort Bragg, N.C.-based counterterrorism unit.
   ``They asked me what I thought Spence wanted to know about the
Delta project,'' the newspaper quoted the witness as saying. ``I
said it could mean he was just interested in the young guys there
or something else.''

   Both Detroit's major newspapers endorsed Tom
Barrow, the 40-year-old accountant who has never held public
office, in his race against front-running Mayor Coleman A. Young,
who is seeking a fifth term.
   The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press in Sunday editions
endorsed Barrow in the Nov. 7 election. Barrow drew 39 percent of
the vote in his 1985 campaign against Young. Polls show the
71-year-old mayor, first elected in 1973, is likely to win.
   Both papers said it was time for a change.
   ``The plain fact is that Coleman Young has run out of steam,''
the News said.
   The Free Press said a vote for Barrow `is really a protest vote,
an almost desperate cry for the kind of sustained effort to achieve
change that the city needs.''
   ``I can't explain the Detroit media,'' Young said during a radio
interview. ``No other press anywhere in the nation of which I am
aware is so negative toward its own city.''
   Barrow said the endorsements show that ``even the establishment,
which has been supporting (Young) for 16 years, now is coming to
agreement with the neighborhoods and recognize it's time for a
change.''

   Authorities say an arsonist may be responsible
for a fire that damaged the home of the missing parents of
Elizabeth Morgan, the physician who was jailed for hiding her
daughter in a child visitation battle.
   No one was in the house when the fire began early Sunday and
there were no injuries, but the fire caused $50,000 damage to the
suburban Fairfax County, Va., home, said county Fire Department
spokeswoman Pam Weiger.
   Ms. Weiger said today that investigators were trying to pin down
the cause.
   Robert Morgan, Elizabeth Morgan's brother, said he believed the
fire was set deliberately.
   ``The way (investigators) told it to us is that arson is the
only reason that makes sense, but they can't say it was arson
unless there's no doubt,'' Robert Morgan said.
   ``The report says that the point of origin was outside the
house. It was not the wiring or anything that did it and it was in
the middle of the night,'' he said.
   Ms. Weiger said she had no more information on the cause of the
fire.
   Robert Morgan said the home has not been occupied since
Elizabeth Morgan was sent to jail more than two years ago for
refusing to produce her daughter, Hilary, for court-ordered visits
with the girl's father.
   Ms. Morgan, 42, alleges her ex-husband, oral surgeon Eric
Foretich, sexually molested the girl. Foretich, 46, denies the
charge and a Washington judge has granted him visitation rights.
   Ms. Morgan spent more than two years in jail and was released
last month after widespread publicity led Congress to pass a bill
that ended her imprisonment.
   But the Morgan parents have not been seen since the summer of
1987 and the girl, who is 7 years old, remains missing.
   Asked in a telephone interview whether his parents knew of the
fire and where they were, Robert Morgan said, ``I prefer not to
say.''
   Ms. Morgan could not be reached for comment.

   Police said today they were
investigating for possible prosecution participants in a rally by
70,000 people in which the outlawed African National Congress'
guerrilla campaign was repeatedly praised.
   ``All that was said and all that took place is being studied,''
said police spokesman Col. Vic Haynes the morning after the welcome
rally for seven recently freed ANC leaders in a soccer stadium
outside Johannesburg.
   Nearly everything about the gathering violated security laws,
but police kept their distance and state television led the evening
news with a report on what was the largest anti-government rally in
South Africa's 79-year history.
   Newspapers, including pro-government media, today called on the
government to do away with laws restricting political activity. And
the goverment hinted it may be considering lifting some
restrictions on political expression to allow peaceful protests.
   ``We must be prepared to run risks,'' Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok said on government-run television Sunday night, adding
that maintaining the status quo is riskier than allowing mass
protests.
   But Andries Treurnicht, head of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party, called for Parliament to meet immediately to discuss the
direction the government was taking.
   ``The ANC, under its own flag and that of the Communist Party
alongside, is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims and
ambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to the
government,'' Treurnicht said.
   ``So-called peace protests are escalating and are accepted by
the government as legal utterances of grievances,'' he said.
   The government granted permission for Sunday's rally as part of
an attempt by new President F.W. de Klerk to promote black-white
negotiations. But a magistrate had warned organizers that speakers
should avoid promoting ANC aims.
   ``We refused,'' said Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader and one of
the main rally organizers. ``The ANC lives. It is amongst us.''
   ``Today, the ANC has captured center stage in South Africa,''
declared Walter Sisulu, 77, the group's former general secretary,
in the main address Sunday to the cheering, singing, dancing throng
which filled most of the seats in the recently opened stadium.
   Police and soldiers set up roadblocks nearby and searched
vehicles, but few security force personnel were visible at the
stadium itself.
   From a podium erected beneath huge banners of the ANC and the
South African Communist Party, Sisulu appeared with six ANC
colleagues freed unconditionally from prison Oct. 15. All but one
had spent at least 25 years in prison.
   Deafening cheers arose when Sisulu and his colleagues slowly
circled the playing field, each walking under an umbrella, behind
an honor guard of 20 young militants, clad in khaki uniforms and
marching in military style.
   ``ANC, ANC,'' shouted the crowd, many dressed in the movement's
green, black and gold colors, or wearing T-shirts with the slogan,
``ANC Lives'' and the names of the freed prisoners.
   The crowd included white South Africans and diplomats from at
least 15 countries.
   Sisulu said his movement would never abandon its guerrilla
campaign unilaterally. But, repeating previous offers, he said it
would consider suspending violence and entering talks if the
government frees all political prisoners, legalizes the ANC and
lifts the 40-month-old state of emergency.
   ``To date, we see no clear indication that the government is
serious about negotiation,'' said Sisulu, who urged intensified
economic sanctions. ``All the utterances are vague.''
   The crowed roared when prominent activist Murphy Morobe read a
letter of greeting from Oliver Tambo, the exiled president of the
ANC, who may not legally be quoted in South Africa.
   ``This is a joyful day for all of us,'' said the message. ``We
meet to celebrate a victory that belongs to all the people of our
country.''
   Tambo directed part of his remarks at South African whites who
seek to maintain apartheid, which denies the nation's 28 million
blacks a voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control
the economy and maintain separate schools, districts and health
services.
   ``They are part of our heritage,'' Tambo's message said. ``In
the end, they too must learn to celebrate freedom and not
oppression.''
   If the government tries to perpetuate minority rule, said Tambo,
blacks will win their stuggle through confrontation.
   In addition to the seven ANC leaders freed Oct. 15, the rally
also honored Govan Mbeki, released from prison in November 1987.
Sisulu, Mbeki and four of the other men were sentenced to life
imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with Nelson Mandela, the
ANC's best-known leader, who remains jailed.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, who earlier this year was at odds with
prominent anti-apartheid leaders, was introduced over the public
address system and had a seat of honor on the podium.
   State television showed footage of the crowd and paraphrased
some of Sisulu's remarks but did not broadcast any excerpts of the
speeches.
   The rally went ahead despite anonymous threats that white
extremists would shoot at black spectators. There were no serious
disturbances.
   Scores of buses brought blacks from communities across the
country.
   The ANC has been outlawed since 1960, a year before it began a
sabotage and bombing campaign. It was founded in 1912 and spent its
first five decades using non-violent tactics to seek rights for
blacks.
   De Klerk, who assumed power in mid-August, has offered to
negotiate a new constitution within five years that would extend
political rights to blacks but protect white interests.
   The ANC wants a constitution that would establish a one-person,
one-vote system.

<TEXT>
   James Earl Ray, who is serving a 99-year
prison sentence for the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King, lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Ray's rights
were not violated when 20 years ago he pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder.
   Ray, 61, will not be eligible for parole until 1998 for the
April 4, 1968, killing of King in Memphis, Tenn. Ray is at Brushy
Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.
   Ray pleaded guilty on March 9, 1969, but retracted his story
three days later and has continued to claim his innocence.
   In his latest appeal, Ray said he received ineffective legal
assistance. A federal judge refused in 1988 to overturn Ray's
conviction, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
judge's ruling last March.
   The case is Ray vs. Jones, 89-374.

<HEAD>Court Bars Lawsuit Against Christian Science Church in Michigan Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred a lawsuit
against the Christian Science church in the death of a 15-month-old
Michigan boy who died of meningitis.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a suit
against the church and its members over faith healing would violate
their religious freedom.
   The case stems from the death of Matthew Swan on July 7, 1977,
from brain abscesses caused by meningitis.
   His parents, Douglas and Rita Swan of Grosse Pointe Park, Mich.,
were lifelong adherents of Christian Science at the time of their
son's death.
   They were advised by two Christian Science healers, Jeanne
Laitner and June Ahearn, to rely on religious faith when Matthew
developed a raging fever about three weeks before he died.
   After their son's death, the Swans sued the two healers and the
church, alleging negligence. The suit said, among other things,
that the healers made inaccurate diagnoses and coerced the parents
to forgo seeking medical help.
   The church was accused of negligence for failing to train the
healers properly.
   A Michigan state judge threw out the suit, and the dismissal was
upheld by a state appeals court in 1986.
   By that time, the Swans had withdrawn from the case and were
replaced as plaintiffs by a representative of their child's estate.
   The appeals court said constitutionally protected yreligious
freedom outweighs, in this case, the state's interest in protecting
children.
   ``Religious conduct is permissible and protected unless the
state can show a compelling state interest in interfering with the
conduct,'' the state court said. ``Even then, the state must act in
the least restrictive manner. We find no merit in (the) argument
that ...(a negligence suit) is the least restrictive means of
regulating spiritual healing practices.''
   Lawyers representing Matthew Swan's estate said the Michigan
ruling conflicts with others that have allowed churches and their
officials to be sued.
   For example, they cited a suit against the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church by two former California members who say they
were duped into joining it.
   The Supreme Court last May refused to block that suit, rejecting
an appeal by the Unification Church.
   The justices in the past have declined to review cases of
alleged clergy malpractice and those in which faith healing
practices are at issue.
   The case is Brown vs. Laitner, 89-354.

<HEAD>Court Turns Away Dispute Over Anti-Bias Laws</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away a dispute
over how to apply federal anti-bias laws to foreign-owned
businesses operating in the United States.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling
challenged both by Korean Air Lines and a Philadelphia man replaced
in his KAL job by a Korean citizen.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Thomas V. MacNamara was fired in 1982 as KAL's
Philadelphia-based district sales manager for Delaware,
Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. He was replaced by Wan Gin
Chung, who is in this country on a visa.
   MacNamara said the airline violated that portion of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 banning discrimination based on race or national
origin.
   MacNamara, 57 when he was fired, also said KAL violated a
federal law against age bias. Chung was 42 in 1982.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in its ruling last
December, gave partial victories to both MacNamara and KAL.
   The appeals court ordered that MacNamara's lawsuit go to trial,
but said he could prevail only if proving KAL intentionally
discriminated against him based on some illegal criterion.
   The appeals court said that to win, MacNamara must prove that
KAL would not have fired him but for his race, national origin or
age.
   MacNamara cannot succeed by showing, primarily with statistical
evidence, that his firing had the effect of discriminating against
older white Americans, the appeals court said.
   The 3rd Circuit court rejected KAL's argument that it should be
shielded from all bias suits because of a 1956 Treaty of
Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and
Korea.
   The treaty gives businesses of each nation broad discretion in
hiring on foreign soil.
   The appeals court said the treaty's ``limited purpose'' is to
assure foreign investors ``the freedom to place their own citizens
in key management positions, thus facilitating their operational
success in the host country.''
   The treaty does not authorize ``a broad exemption from laws that
prohibit discrimination on grounds unrelated to citizenship,'' the
appeals court said.
   KAL lawyers said the ruling will discourage foreign investment
in the United States and American investment abroad.
   MacNamara said the decision gives foreign corporations greater
rights than those of domestic U.S. corporations and exposes U.S.
workers to discrimination.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the
competing appeals.
   The cases are KAL vs. MacNamara, 88-1449, and MacNamara vs. KAL,
88-1551.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact $4.25 Million Award to Navy Divers' Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $4.25
million award to the families of five Navy divers killed in an
accident aboard the submarine USS Grayback in the Philippines seven
years ago.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by General
Dynamics Corp., designer of the diving chamber in which the men
died.
   The accident occurred near Subic Bay the night of Jan. 16, 1982,
when the divers were trapped inside the diving chamber without
adequate air.
   A ventilation valve that allows air to enter the flooded chamber
was not fully open, creating a vacuum as the water drained.
   The victims were William Robinson of Cassopolis, Mich., Richard
Bond of Bremerton, Wash., Charles Bloomer of Middleton, Ky., Rodney
Fitz of Hixson, Tenn., and Leslie Shelton of Goldsboro, N.C.
   The Grayback, originally a missile-carrying sub, was converted
in the late 1960s to dispatch divers underwater.
   General Dynamics designed the diving chamber, which then was
built by the Navy.
   Court records said the Navy was aware of a problem with the
ventilation valve. It was difficult to turn and there were no
warning devices to tell the divers it was not open completely.
   But the sub operated safely for 13 years as the Navy, rather
than redesigning the system, chose to compensate for the problem by
training divers to cope.
   A federal judge in Texas ordered General Dynamics to pay $4.25
million to the victims' families. The Navy was not ordered to pay
any money.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the damage judgment
in February.
   The appeals court, interpreting a key 1988 Supreme Court ruling,
refused to shield General Dynamics from the award.
   The high court last year ruled that a military contractor is
protected from being sued when the government approves equipment
conforming to ``reasonably precise'' Pentagon specifications and
the company warns the government about any potential dangers of
which it is aware.
   The 5th Circuit court said that ruling does not protect General
Dynamics because the Navy, in effect, rubber-stamped the
contractor's design plans. Thus, the appeals court said, it was the
company rather than the Navy that exercised discretion over the
chamber's design.
   ``The government does not exercise a discretionary function by
merely approving the contractor's work,'' the appeals court said.
``If the government delegates its design discretion to the
contractor and allows the contractor to develop the design, the
government contractor defense (against being sued) does not apply.''
   Major military contractors and business groups joined General
Dynamics in urging the Supreme Court to overturn the 5th Circuit
court ruling.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the appeals court ruling
undermines the 1988 Supreme Court decision and could discourage
companies from competing for military contracts.
   The case is General Dynamics vs. Trevino, 89-376.

<HEAD>Court Won't Revive Libel Suit Against Iowa Senator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired Marine lieutenant colonel who worked
for former Sen. Roger Jepsen, R-Iowa, lost a Supreme Court bid
today to revive a libel lawsuit against Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
and two others.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
James Secrist's suit.
   Secrist, while still an active-duty Marine, was assigned to
Jepsen's Senate office staff in 1983.
   The arrangement was a controversial one, with Secrist continuing
to be paid his $45,000 annual salary by the Marine Corps.
   Harkin, a House member at the time who ran against and defeated
Jepsen a in a 1984 Senate race, criticized his Republican
opponent's appointment of Secrist.
   Harkin distributed a statement to the news media that said
Secrist helped raise funds for Jepsen's campaign. The statement
disputed Jepsen's claim that Secrist was hired to help procure
defense contracts for Iowa businesses.
   Secrist retired from the Marines in 1985 to become a Washington
lobbyist for defense contractor Rockwell International Corp. In
1986 he sued Harkin; Pam McKinney, the senator's press secretary;
and Harkin's campaign manager, John Frew.
   Secrist said the 1984 news release was libelous because it
implied he solicited funds for Jepsen in violation of federal law.
Secrist and Jepsen denied that the former Marine solicited campaign
funds.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May upheld a federal
judge's decision to throw out Secrist's suit.
   The appeals court said Harkin's campaign press release was
opinion, not fact.
   ``A campaign press release is not a research monograph,'' the
appeals court said. ``Such a release is at least as likely to
signal political opinion as a newspaper editorial or political
cartoon.''
   Only factual statements, not opinions, may be the basis of a
libel suit, the appeals court said.
   Also, the appeals court said, Secrist failed to prove actual
malice _ that the statements in the news release were made with
knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.
   Secrist said Harkin and his staff aides failed to investigate
before alleging the officer Marine was raising funds for Jepsen.
   But the appeals court said such a lack of investigation is not
``evidence of reckless disregard for the truth.''
   The case is Secrist vs. Harkin, 89-220.

   The Supreme Court today let stand rulings that
may allow Urbana, Ohio, officials to ban as obscene five ``adult''
magazines generally not considered hard-core pornography.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by store owners
who said their free-speech rights were violated by the ban.
   Store owners Charles Downing and Paul Veneroni said the
magazines are known in the publications industry as ``adult
sophisticate'' magazines, similar to Playboy and Penthouse.
   ``Magazines of this genre generally contain erotic photographs
of a woman or a man or couples in various poses, often fully nude,
but avoid explicit depictions of sexual activity,'' the store
owners said.
   The magazines are Nuggets, Velvet, Juggs, Oui and Big Boobs.
   Copies were puchased by Urbana Law Director John Newlin on Nov.
25, 1985, at the Main News and Smoke Shop run by Downing and
Veneroni.
   A municipal judge ruled that the magazines are obscene, opening
the way for city officials to ban their sale in Urbana.
   The Ohio Supreme Court, by a 5-2 vote, upheld the ruling in May.
   ``Courts are not bound by the magazine industry's determination
of what is explicit,'' the state court said. ``All five magazines
contain either in the text, photographs or their advertisements
numerous depictions or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts. (They)
are legally obscene under Urbana ordinances.''
   For example, the state court said, there are ads in the
magazines showing sexual activity in which small black dots were
used to obscure sexual organs. The dots would ``not preclude a jury
from finding'' the pictures are obscene, the state court said.
   The store owners said the ban violates a 1973 Supreme Court
ruling that says material is obscene if the average person using
contemporary community standards finds it appeals to prurient
interests and depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive manner.
That ruling said the work must be judged as a whole, and must be
found to lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.
   The case is Downing vs. Urbana, 89-298.

   Police arrested 169 young curfew violators on the
first night of a three-day campaign against Devil's Night arson, a
spokesman said today.
   Tens of thousands of citizen volunteers helped patrol streets
Sunday in efforts to reduce the number of arson fires stemming from
the traditional Halloween-time spree. City officials did not
release information today on the number of fires reported Sunday
night and this morning.
   For three nights beginning Sunday, those under 18 face arrest if
they are out without an adult between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Those age
17 are being charged with misdemeanor curfew violation, while
younger people are being released to the custody of a parent or
guardian.
   Police Sgt. Christopher Buck, who released the arrest totals
this morning, said he did not know how many of the 169 arrested
were age 17.
   Devil's Night drew national attention in 1984 when 810 fires
were set in Detroit. Since then, the number of fires has declined
each Devil's Night period.
   There were 229 fires reported during the three-day period last
year, an average of 76 per night. About 65 fires are reported on a
normal night in Detroit, fire officials say.
   An estimated 30,000 citizen volunteers were helping patrol
streets on Sunday, authorities said.
   Several fires in garages were reported Sunday night in Detroit's
lower east side. One abandoned home was set on fire twice in a
90-minute period. The second time it burned down and the fire
spread to an occupied home, according to radio station WWJ-AM.
   No injuries were reported in any of the fires.
   Police said they found explosives in a vacant home's garage on
Detroit's northeast side Sunday night, but weren't sure if it was
connected with Devil's Night activity.
   Seven cases of dynamite, six blasting caps and 200 feet of time
fuse were found, said Detroit Police spokesman Officer John
Leavens. No arrests were made and it is unknown when the explosives
were placed in the garage.
   The police bomb squad successfully disposed of the dynamite,
Leavens said.

<HEAD>Drug Manufacturers Lose Appeal of New York Liability Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear
appeals by three drug manufacturers fighting lawsuits over the
effects of DES, a drug once used by pregnant women to prevent
miscarriages.
   The court, without comment, left intact a New York ruling aimed
at forcing all manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages
for injuries allegedly caused by DES.
   DES, the common name for the synthetic female hormone
diethylstilbestrol, was made and sold by some 300 phramaceutical
companies from 1947 until 1971.
   Up to 3 million women used it to help prevent miscarriages. But
in 1970 researchers discovered a connection between DES and cancer
in the daughters of women who used the drug.
   There was evidence the cancer often did not develop until the
daughter of the DES user was from 15 to 25 years old.
   In the cases acted on today, E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Eli Lilly and
Co. and Rexall Drug Co. challenged a ruling last April by the New
York Court of Appeals.
   The state court said it is generally impossible to identify the
manufacturer of the DES ingested in any particular case.
   Druggists usually filled prescriptions from whatever was on hand
_ and one brand of DES pretty much resembled the next, the state
court said.
   Also, it said, because years or decades passed before the cancer
developed, it is practically impossible to trace the producer of
DES in any particular case.
   The state court rejected manufacturers' claims that they should
not be held liable for potentially millions of dollars in damages
when there is no proof they made the drug that caused any injury.
   But, the appeals court said:
   ``It would be inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of a
modern society to say to these (women) that because of the
insidious nature of an injury that long remains dormant, and
because so many manufacturers, each behind a curtain, contributed
to the devastation, the cost of injury should be borne by the
innocent and not the wrongdoers.''
   The state court said damage awards against each company should
be paid based on its percentage of national DES sales.
   This so-called market theory corresponds ``to the overall
culpability of each defendant, measured by the amount of risk of
injury each defendant created to the public at large,'' the state
court said.
   That court also upheld a 1986 New York law that suspended the
deadline for filing damage claims allegedly caused by DES. The law
permitted suits to be filed for one year, regardless of when the
injury occurred.
   Because of the latent nature of DES injuries, ``we believe that
... an injustice has been rectified'' by creating the one-year
window, the state court said.
   The cases are Rexall Drug Co. vs. Tigue, 89-168; E.R. Squibb &amp;
Sons vs. Hymowitz, 89-204; Eli Lilly vs. Hymowitz, 89-397.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand New Jersey Ruling on Police Pursuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to make it
easier for police pursuing people suspected of minor crimes to
enter their homes without court warrants.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a
Moorestown, N.J., man accused of numerous motor vehicle offenses
was arrested unlawfully in his home two years ago.
   Richard J. Bolte was arrested at his home in the predawn hours
of April 6, 1987.
   Police officer William Liss had followed a car he noticed
swerving on and off the road. He tried to pull the car over by
activating his squad car's lights and siren.
   The swerving car ignored the officer's signals and made four
loops through a residential neighborhood before pulling into a
private driveway and into a garage.
   Liss stopped his car in the driveway and ran into the garage. He
told Bolte to stop, but Bolte entered the house. Liss followed him,
telling Bolte that he was under arrest.
   When taken to a police station, Bolte refused to take a
breathalyzer test. He was charged with reckless driving, driving
while intoxicated, refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test,
driving with an expired license, failure to maintain a single lane,
eluding and resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct.
   Bolte sought to have his refusal to submit to a breath test
thrown out as trial evidence, claiming that it was based on an
unlawful arrest.
   A trial judge turned down Bolte's request, but a state appeals
court and the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the evidence must
be suppressed.
   The state's highest court ruled that Bolte's warrantless arrest
in his home amounted to an unreasonable police seizure banned by
the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.
   In the appeal acted on today, New Jersey Attorney General Peter
Perretti relied on previous rulings in which the justices allowed
such warrantless arrests in cases of ``hot pursuit'' by police of
criminal suspects.
   But the New Jersey court said the hot-pursuit exception to the
Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement ``has been interpreted to
apply only to the pursuit of fleeing felons'' _ not people
suspected of relatively minor crimes, or misdemeanors.
   The case is New Jersey vs. Bolte, 89-417.

<HEAD>Court Orders Further Study in Alabama Racial Bias Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered further study
in a lawsuit that's been in federal court for 18 years, in which
black workers allege racial bias at a railroad freight car plant in
Alabama.
   The justices, in a brief order, said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals should restudy the case in light of three of their
recent civil rights rulings.
   In one key decision last summer, the justices made it harder to
win on-the-job bias cases by using statistics to show racial
disparities in an employer's workforce.
   The Bessemer, Ala., plant was at one time the world's largest
for building railroad freight cars. It employed 2,000 in 28
departments before being shut down in 1981.
   The appeals acted on today stem from a 1971 lawsuit accusing
Pullman-Standard and the United Steelworkers union of agreeing to a
contract that discriminated against blacks in hiring, training,
temporary assignments, promotions and in the company's seniority
system.
   The Supreme Court in 1982 overturned a federal appeals court
ruling that the seniority system violated the federal Civil Rights
Act of 1964. The justices said the appeals court exceeded its
authority in determining the seniority system intentionally was
biased.
   But the dispute was far from over. The high court left many
questions unanswered, including whether blacks seeking damages
proved the seniority rules had the effect of discriminating against
them even if unintentional.
   After ensuing lower court hearings, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals last year handed down a lengthy ruling that in part
favored the blacks and in part favored the company and the union.
   The appeals court said the workers proved the company's
procedures for picking supervisors had a discriminatory impact
against blacks.
   The appeals court also said the seniority system was not created
or maintained with discriminatory intent and that any
discrimination in department assignments ended by February 1969.
   But the appeals court, overturning part of a trial judge's
decision, said Pullman-Standard may be forced to pay damages for
racially discriminatory department assignments before February 1969.
   Pullman-Standard asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the suit.
The company said the appeals court relied incorrectly on
statistical evidence to show discriminatory effects.
   The company's lawyers also said the class-action suit on behalf
of all black workers at the plant was defective because some
employees who served as representatives of the class were
ineligible to sue.
   The black workers asked the justices to revive their attack on
the seniority system, and to make it easier to prove their claims
and win damages.
   The cases are Pullman-Standard vs. Swint, 88-1601, and Swint vs.
Pullman-Standard, 88-1602.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal in Maine Marijuana Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
law enforcement officials who discovered marijuana growing on a
Maine couple's heavily wooded property.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that officers
violated the couple's privacy rights when they entered the grounds
without a search warrant.
   The appeal stems from a search by officers from the Kennebec
County Sheriff's Department of Paul Wing's 4.5-acre property in
Litchfield, Maine, on Aug. 19, 1987. Patricia Magagnoli lived there
with Wing.
   The officers, after getting a tip that marijuana was being grown
in the area, flew over it in an airplane and spotted what they
believed to be marijuana plants in a grassy clearing.
   Without a court warrant, they entered Wing's property using a
driveway that splits into a Y about 100 feet from the road. The
left leg of the driveway leads to Wing's home and the right ends at
a grassy area where the officers said they discovered the marijuana.
   The grassy area turned out not to be the same clearing the
officers observed from the airplane. That clearing was on a
neighbor's property where marijuana also was growing.
   The officers got a warrant before seizing the marijuana plants
and searching the home where Wing and Ms. Magagnoli lived.
   A state judge ruled the plants could not be used as evidence
against the couple. The judge said Wing preserved the heavily
wooded nature of the property to guard his privacy, in effect using
trees as a substitute for a fence.
   The judge emphasized that Wing and Ms. Magagnoli said they
sunbathed in the nude and made love in the grassy clearing. The
couple reasonably expected their ``intimate activities'' there
would be as private as if they took place in the home, the judge
said.
   The ruling was upheld by a 3-3 vote of the Maine Supreme
Judicial Court last June.
   Maine prosecutors said the judge's decision conflicts with a
1987 Supreme Court ruling that allowed police without a warrant to
enter fenced-in _ but unwooded _ property and look into a barn
located about 60 yards from a ranch house.
   The justices ruled in that case that the barn was not part of
the homeowner's ``curtilage'' _ the area of land occupied by a
dwelling, its yard and other nearby buildings that are protected
against warrantless searches by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.
   The high court in 1984 reaffirmed a long-standing legal doctrine
that police may enter and search even fenced-in ``open fields''
without a court warrant.
   The case acted on today is Maine vs. Wing, 89-381.

   The Supreme Court today let stand a $1.5
million award won by the family of a U.S. Forest Service employee
who died of cancer after his exposure to a Dow Chemical Co.
herbicide.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear a Dow appeal
aimed at winning a new trial in the product-liability case.
   James Greenhill in 1976-77 was seasonally employed by the Forest
Service in Oregon, primarily as a fire fighter. He also
participated in a weed-control project in which he applied Dow
herbicides, including dichlarophenoxyacetic acid or 2,4-D.
   Greenhill's exposure to 2,4-D ended in 1978 when he was
transferred to another national park.
   A year later, Greenhill was diagnosed as suffering from
Hodgkin's disease. He died in 1986.
   Greenhill sued Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich., in 1979
but his lawsuit sat dormant for six years after wrongly being
included in a series of suits over Vietnam veterans' exposure to
the herbicide Agent Orange. When Greenhill died, his family
replaced him as plaintiffs.
   A federal jury in Marshall, Texas, awarded the Greenhill family
$1.5 million in damages against Dow in 1987.
   At trial, a physician hired as an expert witness by the
Greenhill family testified that 2,4-D caused Greenhill's cancer.
   Among the doctor's medical records submitted in the case, those
of another patient, Joseph Moss, mistakenly were included.
   When a Dow lawyer asked the doctor about Moss, the doctor said
he did not know any such person.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Dow said they learned
after the Greenhill trial that the doctor had known Moss. They said
the ``newly discovered evidence'' entitled Dow to a new trial.
   But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument
in upholding the award last April 4.
   The doctor's false testimony ``could not have affected the
outcome of the trial,'' the appeals court said. ``The further
revelation that (the doctor) had forgotten the name of one patient
could not have affected the jury's verdict. Dow was not hurt by
(the doctor's) confusion.''
   The case is Dow Chemical vs. Greenhill, 89-395.

   A Yugoslavian freighter ran aground in the
westernmost Florida Keys early today, the U.S. Coast Guard
reported. It was the second such accident along the 200-mile
stretch of islands within a week.
   The 475-foot container ship Mavro Vetranic grounded itself in
the Dry Tortugas, a cluster of islands about 70 miles west of Key
West, at about 3:45 a.m. EST, said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis, a Coast
Guard spokesman in Miami.
   Another ship relayed a message on the grounding to the Coast
Guard at 7:50 a.m., said Petty Officer James Wentworth. A Coast
Guard helicopter wasn't expected to reach the ship until late
morning.
   The Coast Guard had very few details of the accident, but
Karonis said there was no report of any spillage from the vessel's
fuel tanks. It wasn't immediately known what type of cargo the
Mavro Vetranic was carrying, if any, nor where the ship was headed,
said Karonis.
   ``There is no visible pollution, there's no injuries at the
moment, and the ship is hard aground,'' Petty Officer Alastair
Worden said after a Coast Guard helicopter flew over the
16-year-old ship.
   The Dry Tortugas is the site of Fort Jefferson National Monument
and is marked by a tall lighthouse as well as the massive fort,
famed for its use as a Union prison during the Civil War.
   A boat from the monument was headed to the ship, which ran
aground on the western edge of the Tortugas, said National Park
Service spokesman Pat Tolle.
   ``The coral reefs will be the concern in this particular
issue,'' Ms. Tolle said.
   The grounding came five days after a much smaller cargo ship,
the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland, ran aground in the Key Largo
National Marine Sanctuary, about 50 miles southeast of Miami in the
Upper Florida Keys.
   First mate Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, has been charged with
negligence, and ship's captain Duane Godwin, 37, has been charged
with allowing a person without the proper license to operate the
vessel.
   Bishop failed two breath-alcohol tests administered about five
hours after the grounding, but he told Coast Guard officials that
he began drinking only after the accident.

<TEXT>
   For the second time in four years, General
Electric Co. went to court today to face charges of defrauding the
defense department.
   General Electric and two employees were accused of cheating the
Pentagon of $10 million. The company, the country's second-largest
defense contractor, faces a fine of $71.9 million if convicted.
   Since the 321-count indictment was returned in November, GE
consistently denied shortchanging the government in a $270 million
contract to make a battlefield computer system.
   The company has acknowledged, however, that an internal
investigation uncovered discrepancies totaling $3.69 million. GE
refunded that money before the indictment was handed up in U.S.
District Court.
   Clayton Undercoffler, GE attorney, said the trial is expected to
last at least two months.
   According to the Pentagon, officials at a GE subsidiary,
Management and Techinical Services Co., based in suburban King of
Prussia, padded costs and failed to notify the Pentagon of savings
negotiated with subcontractors.
   In May 1985, the company pleaded guilty to illegally claiming
$800,000 in cost overruns on Minuteman intercontinental ballistic
missiles and paid a $1.04 million fine.
   GE does approximately $6 billion annually in Defense Department
business that ranges from jet engines and electronic warfare
equipment to highly classified strategic work.
   Jury selection began this morning in the case, which will
scrutinize how GE handled its billing.
   Accused with GE were James Badolato, 41, of Springfield, the
former subcontracts manager for MATSCO, and Gerald A. Leo, 51, of
King of Prussia, MATSCO's materials manager.
   Badolato and Leo were charged with racketeering, five counts of
mail fraud, making false statements and concealing material facts
from a federal agency.
   Both men are now working for GE in other departments.
   GE, which was charged with five acts of mail fraud and with
making 312 false statements to the government, tried unsuccessfully
to settle the case out of court.
   Last week, at a pre-trial hearing before U.S. District Judge
Lowell Reed Jr., the government sought internal company papers GE
has declined to provide on grounds they are privileged
attorney-client communications. The judge reserved decision.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbist, who is prosecuting
with David Harris, argued the government needed the documents to
rebut any GE efforts to show good corporate character.

<HEAD>Court Using Chicago Case to Consider Expanding Search Powers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use a
Chicago drug prosecution to consider expanding police search powers.
   The justices said they will hear arguments that police, acting
without a warrant, should be allowed to use evidence seized after
they were allowed into a man's apartment by his girlfriend.
   The defendant, Edward Rodriguez, was arrested on July 26, 1985,
on charges he possessed cocaine and marijuana with intent to
distribute the drugs. Police said the drugs and drug paraphernalia
were in plain view at Rodriguez's apartment.
   Gale Fisher, who lived with Rodriguez part-time, summoned police
to her mother's home on July 26. She told them Rodriguez had beaten
her at the couple's apartment and she wanted to make a complaint.
   The police then accompanied her to Rodriguez's apartment and she
opened the door with a key. She later testified that she took the
key from Rodriguez's dresser after the two argued earlier that day.
   An Illinois appeals court said police violated the defendant's
rights because Ms. Fisher lacked authority to let the police into
the apartment.
   Police may not enter and search a home without a warrant ``if
the party who consented to the entry had apparent authority to do
so but lacked actual authority,'' the state appeals court said.
   The appeals court noted that Ms. Fisher's name was not on the
apartment lease and she did not help pay the rent. Also, the state
court said, she was an infrequent visitor and did not have access
to the apartment when Rodriguez was not there. She also had moved
her clothes and children to her mother's home, the state court
noted.
   ``All of these factors indicate that Fisher did not have the
common authority over the defendant's apartment that was necessary
to make her consent to enter valid,'' the state court added.
   The Illinois attorney general's office, in appealing to the
Supreme Court, said police acted in good faith when they relied on
Ms. Fisher's ``apparent authority to permit entry into the home.''
   The Supreme Court in 1974 ruled that when one occupant of a home
consents to a search of the premises, evidence police find may be
used against another occupant.
   The case is Illinois vs. Rodriguez, 88-2018.

   President Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador
might think twice the next time he's asked to play tennis with
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The Ecuadoran ended up hobbling on crutches with a cast on his
foot after a morning on the court during the two-day ceremony
honoring Costa Rican democracy.
   When Bush and Baker spoke to a group of Americans at Ambassador
Deane Hinton's house on Saturday, they were gloating about their
6-1 doubles victory over Borja and Argentine President Carlos Menem
that morning.
   ``We blindsided those guys. It was great,'' Bush said, laughing.
``No, it was wonderful.''
   What he didn't say, but later told reporters on Air Force One,
was that Borja had fallen on the court and ``got badly hurt.''
   Borja's doctor was present, and after a brief consultation
allowed his patient to briefly go back to the game, said one
observer.
   But later Borja showed up on crutches at the dedication of San
Jose's Plaza of Democracy.

   Bush's visit to the ambassador's house wasn't all lightness.
About 20 American students staged a silent human rights protest at
the back of the crowd inside the embassy.
   A few hundred embassy workers and other Americans had come to
see Bush, and the students said they had only to show their U.S.
citizenship to get in.
   Dressed in black, they held up small signs, each bearing the
name of a person from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras, and the
word ``Disappeared,'' and ``U.S. $'' The students also held up
large sheet banners reading ``Shame,'' and ``Democracy: Social and
political equality and respect for the individual. Look it up,
George.''
   The students said they were protesting U.S. aid to countries
that still engage in human rights violations. It was not clear if
Bush noticed them.

   Local security for the multinational conference was so rigid
that even reporters, staying in hotels a few miles from the meeting
site and Bush's hotel, were kept under close guard.
   The press hotels were cleared of other guests and only those
wearing press or staff credentials were allowed in the door.
   Throughout San Jose was a show of armed force that was rare in
the small country, the only nation in the region with no army.
   Police troops were called in from around the country to help
provide security for Bush, Colombian President Virgilio Barco and
the other heads of state.
   Armed officers were stationed along the major highway and on
most of the bridges. The usually crowded four-lane highway was
closed Friday and Saturday to all traffic except vehicles on
official business.
   Helping to ease demands on the roads, President Oscar Arias
declared Friday a national holiday.

   When Bush arrived in Costa Rica, much of the attention was on
whether he would shake hands with Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega.
   They did that. But by the time he left town, Bush vented some
harsh feelings about the Nicaraguan he called a ``little man'' who
was ``always kind of sidling up to me for some photo op.''
   Ortega used the occasion on Friday to threaten to break the
cease-fire with the Contra rebels.
   The U.S. delegation gave him the cold shoulder that night during
a gala dinner. Asked if Bush and Ortega had talked at a cocktail
party before the dinner, Nicaraguan Ambassador to Costa Rica Saul
Arana said, ``Not even eye contact.''
   It was Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney whom Ortega
engaged at the dinner table.
   While Honduran President Jose Azcona sat quietly between them,
Ortega talked nonstop to Mulroney during the time a group of
photographers and reporters was in the room.
   Earlier, when Ortega was telling reporters on what he said to
Bush during their handshake meeting, Mulroney seemed eager to chime
in on behalf of his U.S. friend.
   Asked what he saw of the Bush-Ortega conversation, he said he
``didn't see them having a conversation. I saw them having a
courtesy chat.''

   National Guard troops resumed their
search this morning in the woods and fields near the spot where an
11-year-old boy was abducted by a masked gunman eight days ago.
   About 225 National Guard troops and 80 Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources workers searched unsuccessfully Sunday for clues
in the abduction of Jacob Wetterling, while supporters of the boy's
family released more than 1,000 white balloons after a church
service.
   ``There's a lot of power here, a lot of hope. I've got to feel
very hopeful,'' said the missing boy's mother, Patty Wetterling.
   A highway into St. Joseph, a town of about 3,000 some 80 miles
northwest of Minneapolis, was blocked Sunday night as authorities
stopped drivers to ask if they had been in the vicinity the evening
of Oct. 22, when the boy was kidnapped.
   Those who had were shown three composite sketches of possible
suspects. Authorities earlier had released one of the sketches, a
picture of a man wearing glasses who is believed to have tried to
kidnap a 10-year-old boy in Stearns County during the summer.
   The other two sketches will not be released to the public until
authorities follow leads from Sunday night's roadblock questioning,
an agent at the Stearns County Law Enforcement Center said.
   Jacob, described as a top student and hockey player, was
abducted at gunpoint by a masked man on a dark stretch of road less
than a mile from his home on the town's outskirts. The incident
occurred as Jacob, his 10-year-old brother, Trevor, and an
11-year-old friend were returning from a convenience store about
9:30 p.m.
   The abductor asked the boys how old they were then held onto
Jacob and threatened to shoot the other two unless they ran away.
   The release of the helium-filled balloons, each labeled with the
words ``Jacob's Hope,'' was another attempt by the town to sustain
the search's momentum.
   ``I think they (the balloons) are sending out all our love all
over the place and I don't think there is a place that is going to
be untouched by this,'' Mrs. Wetterling said.
   A white sweat sock found Saturday near the kidnapping site was
to be analyzed today at the state crime lab to determine if it is
linked to the abduction, sheriff's officials said.
   ``There's been no additional finding of clues,'' said State
National Guard Maj. Nate Thomas. The search stretched from dawn to
dark each day over the weekend.
   Oakland Athletics catcher Terry Steinbach, a Minnesota native,
wore a ``J'' on the back of his batting helmet during the fourth
game of the World Series in San Francisco on Saturday night to help
focus nationwide attention on the search for Jacob.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
ruling government lawyers say threatens the federal program
protecting the pensions of 30 million American workers.
   The justices said they will decide what authority the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency, has to order
employers to restore terminated pension plans.
   A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside
the agency's order that LTV Corp. and its subsidiary, LTV Steel
Co., restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $2.3
billion.
   The appeal acted on today said the ruling, if not overturned,
could make the agency ``an open-ended source of industry bailouts''
and ``could lead to a financial crisis similar to that currently
facing'' the government's insurance program for the savings and
loan industry.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Turned away an appeal by a Nebraska state agency that wants to
test its employees for AIDS.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that blocked the
Eastern Nebraska Human Services Agency from imposing mandatory
blood testing of employees who come into direct contact with the
mentally retarded people the agency serves.
   _ Agreed to use a Chicago drug prosecution to consider expanding
police search powers.
   The justices said they will hear arguments that police, acting
without a warrant, should be allowed to use evidence seized after
they were allowed into a man's apartment by his girlfriend.
   _ Barred a lawsuit against the Christian Science church in the
death of a 15-month-old Michigan boy who died of meningitis.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a suit
against the church and its members over faith healing would violate
their religious freedom.
   _ Rejected an appeal by an American Humanist Association member
who says he should have as much right as an ordained minister to
perform marriage ceremonies.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that a
Virginia law favoring ministers violates religious freedom and the
constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   _ Refused to hear appeals by three drug manufacturers fighting
lawsuits over the effects of DES, a drug once used by pregnant
women to prevent miscarriages.
   The court, without comment, left intact a New York ruling aimed
at forcing all manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages
for injuries allegedly caused by DES.
   _ Turned away an appeal by a former Beech-Nut executiv e
fighting his conviction for selling adulterated apple juice.
   The court, without comment, left intact John F. Lavery's
sentence of a year and a day in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   _ Turned down an appeal by James Earl Ray, who is serving a
99-year prison sentence for the assassination of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Ray's rights
were not violated 20 years ago when he pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder.
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, modeled after the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., is wholly owned by the federal government. Its
board of directors is comprised of the secretaries of labor,
treasury and commerce.
   The agency protects the pension benefits of the 30 million
Americans who participate in single-employer defined benefit
pension plans.
   When a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy
promised benefits, the federal agency becomes the pension plan's
trustee, taking over its assets and liabilities. The agency then
pays all benefits workers had earned as of the date the pension
plan ended.
   In fiscal year 1988, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
paid $324.7 million in insured benefits to 113,000 retirees who
participated in 1,476 terminated pension plans.
   The cost of the pension insurance is paid primarily by employers
with active pension plans, and by employers who terminate
underfunded pension plans.
   The agency has money problems of its own. In its most recent
annual report, the PBGC listed liabilities of $4 billion and assets
of $2.4 billion.
   The Dallas-based LTV Corp. and LTV Steel, after filing for
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in 1986, advised the
PBGC that they could not and would not fund the three pension plans
they sponsored. The plans, which have about 100,000 participants,
were terminated in 1987.
   In a deal with the United Steelworkers of America union,
however, LTV Steel agreed to what government lawyers contend is a
``follow-on'' arrangement. Under it, LTV agreed to make up any
benefits lost to employees because of the pension plans'
termination _ those benefits not covered by the federal pension
insurance program.
   The result: employees continued to receive the same benefits
they did before the plans were terminated, and payment of unfunded
pension liabilities was shifted to the PBGC.
   LTV was responsible for $75 million in annual supplemental
retirement benefits, and the federal agency was making good on some
$400 million in annual obligations to LTV pensioners.
   The PBGC contends such arrangements are abusive, and the agency
ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the three pension plans.
   When LTV refused, the agency sought to enforce its order in
federal court.
   A federal judge threw out the PBGC's order for restoration of
the pension plans, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
that ruling last May 12.
   Federal law ``reveals no indication that Congress intended the
establishment of successive benefit plans to be a ground for
restoration,'' the appeals court ruled.
   It also said the PBGC's action was ``arbitrary and capricious''
because it failed to consider the goals of federal bankruptcy and
labor laws when issuing its restoration order.
   The PBGC then sought Supreme Court review, contending that the
2nd Circuit court's ruling ``places the pension insurance program
in serious financial jeopardy'' and ignores what Congress attempted
to achieve in passing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 (ERISA).
   ``Other companies will follow LTV's example and use pension
insurance as a subsidy to reduce costs and gain a competitive
edge,'' the appeal said.
   Justice Department lawyers sided with the PBGC, telling the high
court, ``The PBGC has reasonably concluded that restoration is an
appropriate response to the adoption of abusive follow-on plans.''
They said the appeals court ruling ``threatens to undermine ... a
program already seriously in debt.''
   But lawyers for LTV said Congress ``specifically rejected
proposed prohibitions on follow-on plans'' when substantially
amending ERISA in 1987.
   The case is PBGC vs. LTV, 89-390.

   The city district court today sentenced a
Palestinian to 16 life terms for forcing a bus off a cliff, killing
16 people, Israel radio reported.
   The court gave Abdel Hadi Ghanem a life sentence for each of the
passengers who died in the crash and 20-year sentences for each of
the 24 passengers injured, said the state prosecutor, Uzi Hasson.
   Hasson said it was the stiffest sentence since the start of the
22-month Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said Ghanem is ineligible for parole
and can only be freed by a presidential pardon.
   ``It was a terrorist killing of 16 innocent people who were only
trying to travel home safely. They were young, they were old, men,
women. They found their deaths by the accused, but they did nothing
wrong,'' Hasson said in an interview.
   The bus was en route to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv on July 6 when
Ghanem grabbed the steering wheel and forced the bus into a deep
ravine.
   The victims included an American woman and two Canadian tourists.
   Ghanem, who also was injured in the incident, said he decided to
carry out a suicide attack after soldiers shot and wounded his best
friend in a clash near his home in the Gaza Strip's Nusseirat
refugee camp. His friend was paralyzed as a result of the incident.
   At least 607 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
Palestinian revolt against the Israeli occupation. An addition 137
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most as suspected
collaborators with Israel. Forty Israelis have died.
   The latest victim was a 24-year-old Palestinian who died today
of a gunshot wound suffered five days ago in the Farah refugee camp
in the West Bank, the army said.
   He was identified as Hussein Mohammad Hassani and the army said
he was about to throw a cement building block at soldiers when he
was hit.
   News of Hassani's death sparked demonstrations in the Farah
camp, and the army imposed a curfew on the area. Two Palestinians
were wounded, including a 17-year-old youth who was shot in the
chest, the army said.
   In a stone-throwing clash with soldiers in the Gaza Strip's
Shabura refugee camp, a 14-year-old Palestinian was critically
wounded when he was hit in the head with a plastic bullet, Arab
reports said.
   The youth, identified as Ashraf Kishda, was taken to Soroka
Hospital in Israel, the reports said.
   A Canadian television correspondent was hit in the leg by a
rubber-coated metal pellet fired by soldiers as he filmed the
clash. He was identified as Jean Francois Lepine of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.
   Israeli newspapers reported that the army soon will begin
deploying observation balloons equipped with cameras to pinpoint
rioting related to the uprising.
   The army spokesman's office declined comment on the reports,
which said the unmanned balloons will be floated over refugee camps
and other areas and transmit live photos to ground forces.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was urged today to strike
down a federal judge's order doubling local property taxes to pay
for school desegregation in Kansas City, Mo.
   Calling the judge's 1987 order ``taxation without
representation,'' an attorney for the state of Missouri, H. Bartow
Farr III, argued that federal courts lack the power to order higher
taxes even to correct a constitutional violation such as racial
discrimination in schools.
   ``There is no power to tax, period,'' Farr told the justices in
oral arguments.
   The state asked the high court to overturn a decision by the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the property tax increase
ordered by U.S. District Judge Russell Clark.
   Lawyers for both sides spent perhaps a third of the 60-minute
argument session answering questions by several of the justices
about a possible procedural flaw that could preclude any
constitutional ruling in the case.
   The school district and a group of school children, who brought
the original desegregation case in 1977, urged the court to uphold
the tax decision. The district also maintained that the state
waited too long to file a Supreme Court appeal, rendering it
unnecessary for the justices to address the tax issue.
   Allen Snyder, an attorney for the district, contended that state
property tax law and local voters must not be allowed to frustrate
the constitutional rights of Kansas City's minority schoolchildren
to an equal educational opportunity.
   Snyder said it was ``dangerously wrong'' to assume that federal
courts lack powers to implement their orders to correct
constitutional violations. The courts, he said, ``have the powers
and have the duty to use their equitable discretion'' to remedy
such wrongs as racial segregation in schools.
   The court is expected to issue a decision in the case by next
July.
   Legal scholars and education officials say the court's decision
could shape future school desegregation plans across the country
and define the federal courts' power to remedy constitutional
violations involving issues from prison overcrowding to fair
housing.
   Clark ordered the tax increase in September 1987 after the local
school district was unable to pay its share of a more than $400
million desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements
in buildings and establishment of special ``magnet'' schools.
   State law says local property taxes may be raised only with
voters' approval, and in some instances only with a two-thirds
majority. District voters had not approved a levy increase since
1969, with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to
finance the desegregation plan.
   In addition to doubling the property tax, Clark imposed an
income tax surcharge on those people living or working in the
school district.
   The appeals court struck down the income surcharge in August
1988, but upheld the district court's authority to order an
increase in the property tax. However, the appeals court modified
the procedure for imposing the higher tax levy.
   The appeals court found that state law had effectively prevented
the school district from levying the necessary taxes to pay for the
desegregation plan. It upheld Clark's order as one that ``set aside
levy limitations,'' and empowered the elected local school board to
set the needed tax levels within certain limits.

   The Soviet Union on Monday said it might cut oil
exports by about 76,000 barrels a day in 1990 so the fuel could be
used domestically.
   The proposal, which amounts to a cut of roughly 2.8 percent of
estimated Soviet oil exports of 2.8 million barrels per day, came
in documents submitted to the Soviet legislature's discussion of
the 1990 budget.
   The Soviet Union suffers erratic domestic gasoline shortages,
and Soviet TV has shown farms unable to harvest grain for lack of
fuel. Officials have said recent coal strikes could result in power
shortages during the long winter.

   U.S. and Egyptian military forces will hold
joint military exercises Nov. 11-17, the air force commander said
Monday.
   ``We benefit from these maneuvers by getting acquainted with the
most advanced weapons and through our direct contact with the U.S.
military,'' Lt. Gen. Alaa Barakat told a news conference marking
the 57th anniversary of the establishment of the Egyptian air force.
   The exercises will be the fifth in the series of ``Bright Star''
war games the two countries have held every two years since 1981.
The last maneuvers were staged in Egypt in August 1987, with more
than 9,000 troops from each side participating.
   Cairo receives $1.3 billion in military aid and $865 million in
economic assistance from the United States. Egypt is the
second-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid after Israel.
   Barakat also said that in 1991, Egypt will receive 40 F-16
fighters, among the most advanced in the world. Egypt already has
taken delivery of 80 F-16s.

<HEAD>China Scaling Down Martial Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed police will replace soldiers in Tiananmen
Square and troops have been withdrawn from intersections in a major
scaling down of the capital's 5-month-old martial law, officials
said Monday.
   The move appeared a test of Beijing's stability before martial
law is lifted completely, which a government spokesman recently
said will happen ``before very long.''
   Premier Li Peng ordered martial law in most of Beijing on May 20
as hundreds of thousands of students and citizens marched through
the streets daily to demand democratic reform. The army ended the
protests June 3-4 by shooting its way through the crowd to retake
Tiananmen Square, the demonstrators' base.
   ``Since achieving a decisive victory in the struggle to quell
the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the situation in the capital is
moving daily toward stability and social order is basically
normal,'' the city government and martial law command post said in
an announcement on the local TV news.
   ``Therefore ... effective upon announcement of this order,
martial law sentinels at overpasses and intersections will
completely withdraw.''
   As of Monday night, overpasses where soldiers had stood around
the clock under brightly colored umbrellas were unguarded except
for surveillance cameras on lampposts. The only soldiers in view in
the city center were around the perimeter of Tiananmen Square and
at nearby intersections.
   Few military trucks were on the streets Monday night. On recent
nights, convoys of hundreds of trucks of troops and supplies have
been seen moving through the city, their destination unclear.
   The order said soldiers in Tiananmen Square will be replaced
Tuesday by ordinary police and People's Armed Police, a special
security unit.
   It made clear, however, that martial law was not being lifted.
   ``Some soldiers stationed in the city and suburbs, together with
police and People's Armed Police, will continue in some districts
to carry out their martial law duties,'' it said.
   ``We hope that all city residents will voluntarily respect
martial law orders and regulations and actively uphold the
capital's normal work, production, education, scientific research
and social order.''
   Martial law orders forbid marches, strikes, class boycotts,
public speeches, distributing pamphlets, spreading rumors and other
``destructive activity.''
   Large-scale resistance to martial law was crushed in the week
after the June 3-4 army attack, and since then only isolated cases
of civilians attacking soldiers have been reported. The government
said many guns were stolen from army trucks during the troops'
sometimes-bumbling entry into Beijing, and that martial law was
necessary to protect social order.
   Gunshots still ring out at night without any official
explanation.
   The number of troops visible in the city has fallen sharply
since midsummer, when at least 150,000 were stationed along main
roads and in key facilities such as the television station and
Great Hall of the People.
   Only several dozen now guard the perimeter of Tiananmen Square,
restricting access to what used to be a favorite recreation spot.
They are armed with automatic rifles and wear helmets.
   Despite the reduction in troop presence, martial law has
discouraged many tourists from returning, and Western diplomats
have indicated that lifting martial law is a minimum requirement
for their governments to lift sanctions imposed in June. Most
Western governments have halted high-level contacts and military
sales, and have opposed new low-interest loans to China by
international institutions such as the World Bank.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu said last week martial law was
``for a limited time and it seems that it will be lifted before
very long.'' He refused to disclose a date.

   China is facing a musical talent shortage because
top artists are leaving for foreign countries, an official daily
said Monday.
   The China Youth News said 470 musicians, mostly highly skilled
professionals, have gone abroad at their own expense in the past
decade. The newspaper implied that few are likely to return.
   The daily said the exodus includes musicians from the Central
Conservatory of Music, the Central Ballet Ensemble, the Central
Philharmonic Society and the Central Opera Theater.
   Unlike writers, film directors and artists who have left China
for political reasons, most departing musicians are seeking to
escape the restrictive atmosphere of being locked into one group or
genre and live in a place where they have more freedom to express
their musical talents.
   The daily said the musicians have left for the United States,
France, Italy, Japan, West Germany, Australia, Canada, Austria,
Switzerland, Belgium and Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Will Decide Port Authority Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case likely to affect
other multi-state agencies, agreed today to decide whether a New
York-New Jersey transportation authority may be sued in federal
court.
   The justices said they would hear arguments by the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey seeking to kill lawsuits by
two employees.
   The authority was created in 1921 in a Congress-approved compact
between the two states. It operates airports, trains linking New
Jersey and New York City and other transportation facilities.
   The authority is run by 12 commissioners, six each appointed by
the governors of the respective states. The governors also have
veto power over actions by the commissioners.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in New York City
ruled in April that Port Authority employees Charles T. Foster and
Patrick Feeney may sue the agency in federal court. The appeals
court said the 11th Amendment to the Constitution shielding states
from federal court suits does not apply to the interstate agency.
   The 2nd Circuit court said the authority may be sued for money
damages largely because any judgment it would be forced to pay
would come from its revenues rather than the taxpayer-supported
treasuries of the two states.
   ``We believe that this insulation of state treasuries from the
liabilities of the Port Authority outweighs both the methods of
(commisioner) appointment and gubernatorial veto,'' the appeals
court said.
   The appeals court invited the Supreme Court to review the
ruling, noting that the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals has issued a conflicting ruling on the authority's
immunity from suit.
   The 2nd Circuit court said the 3rd Circuit was in error in
concluding that the taxpayers of New York and New Jersey could be
forced to pay damages if a suit depleted the agency's resources.
   Feeney is seeking $3 million for injuries he suffered while
working at a maintenance shop run by the authority in 1986.
   The case is Port Authority vs. Feeney, 89-386.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Two-Year Suspension of Embattled Priest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN J. SIMON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A socially active inner-city Episcopal
priest who sued his diocese and its bishop lied when he accused
them of conspiring to control his parish's money, a church panel
concluded today.
   In the first ecclesiastical trial ever held in the Newark
diocese, the five priests on the panel unanimously recommended that
the Rev. George Swanson be suspended for two years from ministerial
or administrative involvement in the church. Bishop John S. Spong
must still approve the recommendation, and Swanson's attorney said
he would appeal.
   Swanson, who filed the lawsuit in 1988 accusing Spong and the
diocese of engaging in a conspiracy against his tiny Jersey City
parish, did not show any emotion as the recommendation was read.
The lawsuit was dismissed from Superior Court on the grounds it was
a church matter, but Swanson is appealing that decision.
   About 20 Ascencion Church parishioners, who had gathered at
diocesean headquarters for the verdict, appeared stunned but
remained quiet.
   Swanson, 56, a San Francisco native, has headed the church in a
poverty-stricken Jersey City neighborhood for 12 years.
   Teresa Russell, a parishioner for eight years, said Sunday that
Swanson had drawn her back into the Episcopal church with social
activism and efforts to make religion relevant to current problems.
Swanson wore a button at today's announcement of the verdict urging
South Africa to free black activist Nelson Mandela.
   Swanson's attorney, Edwin Robertson, said the priest would
appeal to the church's provincial court of review.
   The panel decided that Swanson had known that the allegations he
made in the suit were false.
   ``The filing of the secular court action ... should never be
done lightly or unadvisedly and certainly not before exploring
other avenues,'' the panel said. The group ruled that Swanson
failed to make a good-faith effort to settle the dispute.
   Swanson, who has been banned from practicing his priestly duties
since March, was the first church official to face an
ecclesiastical trial since the Episcopal diocese was founded 113
years ago.
   In his lawsuit, Swanson charged that Spong, diocese vice
chancellor Michael Rehill and the diocese itself manipulated canon
law to try to take control of the parish's assets, including
$600,000 paid out by an insurance company after a fire all but
destroyed the church in 1986.
   At the end of the nine-day trial Thursday, diocese prosecutor
Richard B. McGlynn called Swanson a ``failed priest'' and a
``liar.''
   On Sunday, in the smoke-stained chapel of Ascencion Church, a
small cluster of faithful rallied on behalf of the priest. The
chapel is all that remains of the church. It has received only
makeshift repairs since the fire because the parish's funds became
embroiled in a legal battle with the diocese.

   Richard Nixon today called on the United States
and China to restore relations and urged China's leaders to fulfill
their people's desire for more freedom.
   The former president, the most prominent American to visit China
since the June military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement,
made the remarks at a banquet at which Premier Li Peng was host.
   Nixon said the killing of hundreds of unarmed citizens as troops
stormed central Beijing to recapture student-held Tiananmen Square
had ``cast a shadow over our relations.''
   Addressing Li, one of the leaders responsible for calling in the
military, Nixon said differences between ``you, a Chinese Communist
who believes in Leninist rule (and) I, an American conservative who
believes in capitalism and democracy, are too great to permit a
common understanding of this tragedy.''
   But he added: ``Let us not become mired in endless and fruitless
recriminations over the seeming impasse .... Both of our nations
must now deal realistically with the aftermath.''
   He said the two powers should return to the formula of 1972, the
year of Nixon's historic door-opening visit to China,
``acknowledging our profound differences while realistically
identifying and pursuing our common interests.''
   U.S.-Chinese relations have hit a low since June, with
Washington cutting off all high-level official contacts and Beijing
accusing the United States of supporting forces trying to turn
China into a capitalist state.
   In Washington, asked about Nixon's statement that it was time to
normalize relations, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said:
   ``We have always said that we want to resume good relations with
China at some point. The question really is, when and under what
conditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached that
time and we have not seen the right conditions.''
   Asked if Nixon was carrying a letter from Bush to the Chinese
leadership, Fitzwater said: ``I'm not aware of a letter. Now he
talked to the president and to Gen. Scowcroft (Bush's national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft) before he left, so maybe he
interpreted that conversation as some kind of message.''
   Nixon said it was in neither in China's nor America's interest
for China to return to its former isolation.
   ``The choice is clear,'' Nixon said. ``Shall China turn away
from greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression
and stagnation? Or does it continue to venture forth on the open
seas on a journey which may at times be rough but which leads to
progress and peace and justice for its people?''
   Nixon expressed confidence that a ``humanely governed China that
is responsive to the yearnings of its people will continue its
rapid ascent in world affairs.''
   ``Let us therefore rise above the acrimony of the moment and
resume the progress and cooperation that are worthy of two great
peoples,'' he said.
   Nixon, traveling as a private citizen at the government's
invitation, was making his sixth visit since his 1972 trip. That
journey paved the way for restoration of China-U.S. ties in 1979.
   At a banquet Saturday night, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
praised Nixon for having shown the ``foresight and sagacity of an
outstanding statesman'' in 1972.
   ``At present, when Chinese-U.S. relations are at a difficult and
critical moment, he is paying his sixth visit to China, once again
showing his political foresight and courage,'' Qian said.
   The former president, who arrived Saturday, was expected to meet
senior leader Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday.

   Less than a year ago, Chinese and U.S. officials
gathered at a glittering hotel and celebrated 10 years of
friendship with dumplings and Coca-Cola.
   Then came the Chinese army attack in June on students
demonstrating for democratic reform, and both sides wondered if
they hadn't made a terrible mistake.
   Americans expressed horror that a country they regarded as
friendly was capable of such harsh repression.
   Chinese officials accused Americans of taking advantage of
China's ``open door'' to sow subversive ideas among intellectuals
and students.
   The topic of relations has become so ideologically sensitive
that Chinese scholars on U.S. affairs refuse to be interviewed.
Many have been investigated for alleged involvement in the
democracy movement.
   Months have gone by but emotions remain high on both sides, with
little prospect of cooling soon. Leading proponents of realpolitik,
including former President Richard Nixon and his former aide,
Alexander Haig, have visited Beijing and said it is in both sides'
interests to maintain good relations.
   At a banquet Monday, Nixon said China and the United States must
overcome ``huge and unbridgeable'' differences and resume
cooperation. He also called for a ``humanely governed China.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington: ``We
have always said that we want to resume good relations with China
at some point. The question really is, when and under what
conditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached that
time and we have not seen the right conditions.''
   Indeed, each government has made it clear it expects the other
to make the first move in returning to ``normalcy.''
   Some say it was the past relationship that was abnormal, with
both sides allowing emotional attraction to outweigh differences in
ideology and even practical self-interest.
   ``There was an element of delusion _ that things were getting
better every day in every way,'' said one American working in
Beijing. Even if the two governments mend their ties, he said,
``things are not going to be the way they were before.''
   The clearest symbols of the new relationship are the guards,
with battle helmets and automatic rifles, who took up positions
around the U.S. Embassy and ambassador's residence in June.
Plainclothes officials lurk nearby in unmarked cars.
   As long as Chinese dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li
Shuxian, remain in one of the U.S. compounds, the special guard is
unlikely to leave.
   Things could get worse. Legislation is pending in the U.S.
Congress that would suspend government trade and development
programs, bar sales of police equipment, limit high-technology
transfers and allow Chinese students in the United States to stay
several years beyond their visa expiration dates.
   So far, the only sanctions are those announced in June by
President Bush, who halted high-level contacts and military sales
and urged a freeze on international agencies' loans to China.
   Bush said he is waiting for the ``proper signals'' from Chinese
leaders before lifting the measures, but has not spelled these out.
Signals might include an end to martial law in Beijing, imposed May
20 during the peak of the student protests, or other moves to ease
the crackdown on dissent.
   The United States has said it wants non-political exchanges to
go on, especially cultural ones. But here China has pulled back,
cancelling scholarly exchanges and plans to accept Peace Corps
volunteers. Chinese education officials have indicated fewer
students will be sent to the United States.
   China also has avoided spelling out conditions for
normalization, but says the United States must take the initiative.
Its basic demand is U.S. silence on Chinese domestic affairs.
   The quarrel is not the first since China and the United States
re-established diplomatic relations on Jan. 1, 1979, nor is it in
some ways the worst. U.S. arms sales to the rival government on
Taiwan in the early 1980s triggered threats from Beijing to
downgrade relations.
   China canceled sports and cultural exchanges in 1983 after the
United States granted asylum to a defecting Chinese tennis player,
Hu Na.
   It may be proof of the relationship's maturity that this time
China has not threatened to cut or downgrade relations, and that
many normal exchanges have gone on, including trade.
   China also appears to be drawing a line between hard-line
statements for domestic consumption, which condemn the United
States as decadent and imperialist and accuse it of violating
international law, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's more moderate
statements to foreign audiences, in which he stresses respecting
differences and seeking common ground.
   On neither side do conditions yet exist for compromise.
   The lineup of forces in China's domestic power struggle requires
officials to prove their ideological purity by denouncing Western
``bourgeois'' ideas.
   In the United States, the administration seems disposed to
resume normal ties gradually. But it is held back by continued
anger from a public that watched the confrontation between troops
and protesters on television.
   Chinese scholars noted last year, even during the anniversary
celebrations, that the potential existed for serious rifts.
   ``We are friends, not allies,'' said Mei Renyi, an associate
professor of American studies at the Beijing University of Foriegn
Studies. He could not be interviewed now because he is being
investigated for supporting the democracy movement.
   ``Our systems are different, our ideologies are different,'' he
said then. ``Our expectations should be realistic.''

   Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega is being beseiged by
the rest of Central America to continue a 19-month cease-fire with
the Contra rebels, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today, and the U.S. position is one of ``waiting and watching,''
   Ortega's threat at a weekend conference in Costa Rica to abolish
the cease-fire _ since modified _ brought him ridicule from
President Bush, joined later by sharp criticism from U.S.
congressional leaders.
   ``The issue pretty much goes back to President Ortega and the
Sandinistas in the sense that he's changed his position a little
bit,'' Fitzwater said. ``We obviously are urging that the
cease-fire be maintained.''
   ``At this point it's pretty much a point of waiting and watching
to see what he (Ortega) does,'' the spokesman said.
   He said Ortega's threat to end the unilateral cease-fire has
alienated most of Nicaragua's neighbors and that Ortega was being
pressured by them to preserve the status quo.
   After first declaring his intention to end the cease-fire, the
Nicaraguan leader said he would decide Tuesday whether to extend
the truce or to resume hostilities between his leftist Sandinista
government and U.S.-backed Contras.
   Ortega had claimed he would abrogate the cease-fire because
Contra forces had violated it, but Fitzwater accused the
Sandinistas of violating the cease-fire far more often than the
rebels.
   ``Violations by the Sandinistas dwarf the violations by the
Contras,'' he said.
   At the same time, Fitzwater defended Bush's depiction of Ortega
as a ``little man.''
   ``The president was referring to small-minded pettiness,'' and
not Ortega's height, he said.
   Even though administration officials privately said it was
unlikely that the administration would seek a renewal of lethal
military aid for the Contras, Fitzwater refused to be drawn into a
discussion of the prospects.
   ``We just won't speculate on the possibility,'' he said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., on Sunday joined Bush's condemnation of
Ortega for threatening to end the cease-fire.
   ``It was a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it,''
said Mitchell. Dole, calling Ortega a ``tinhorn dictator,'' said he
will present a resolution to the full Senate on Tuesday condemning
the Nicaraguan leader.
   For his part, Bush on Saturday called Ortega a ``little man''
and an ``unwanted animal at a garden party'' after Ortega said he
might no longer honor the cease-fire between his Sandinista
government and the U.S.-backed Contras that has been in effect
since March 1988.
   Although he later said he would decide on Tuesday whether to
break the cease-fire, Ortega's original declaration marred a
two-day Western Hemisphere conference held in Costa Rica to honor
that nation's 100 years as a democracy.
   Any effort to renew U.S. military aid to the Contras would be
sure to generate strong new opposition in Congress. The agreement
reached last spring between the administration and Congress
envisions a disbanding of the Contras after the Feb. 25 elections.
   The agreement gives congressional committees that oversee Contra
aid the authority to cancel a $49 million aid package when they
review it a final time in late November.
   Bush, asked at a news conference on Saturday whether he would
now press for more military aid for the Contras, said, ``We'll let
you know, we'll let you know.''
   However, a senior administration official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said Bush was not trying to hint that he
might seek to renew military aid.
   Mitchell, interviewed along with Dole on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' called Ortega's declaration _ which startled participants
at the conference _ an outgrowth of a rivalry between the
Nicaraguan leader and Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   ``It is my hope the free and open election process will go
forward and that the results will be accepted by the people of
Nicaragua,'' Mitchell said.
   He said ``we intend to honor'' the agreement with the
administration last spring to provide humanitarian assistance
through the Feb. 25 elections in Nicaragua.
   Dole said he hoped as a result of Ortega's statements ``we'd
have quick action on the remaining humanitarian aid.''
   ``There are 2 million people registered to vote'' in the
election, in which Ortega is a candidate, said Dole. ``I think
Ortega sees that as a danger to his dictatorship. If it's a fair
election, he's gone _ which would be good news for everyone.''
   The focus now remains one of support for Ortega's opponent,
Violeta Chamorro, in the February presidential election, as well as
measures aimed at ensuring that the voting is honest. The United
States is funneling $9 million through the National Endowment for
Democracy, a quasi-governmental agency that promotes democratic
elections around the world.
   A plan advanced in August by the presidents of five Central
American countries calls for the disbanding of the Contras even
before the elections, by Dec. 8.
   A cease-fire has never been formally agreed between the
Sandinistas and the Contras, though Ortega has informally extended
it on a monthly basis since March 1988.
   Scattered fighting has continued all along, so whether Ortega
intends any real escalation of his military operations against the
dwindling Contra force, such as attacking rebel camps in Honduras,
remains to be seen.
   An administration official said U.S. policy is for neither side
to violate the cease-fire. In fact, the official said, the United
States cut off assistance to a group of Contras operating in the
southern part of the country several months ago when U.S. officials
learned they were violating the cease-fire.

<HEAD>White House Rejects Call for Higher Taxes on Gasoline</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs, editing to tighten</HEAD>

   The White House today rejected a Republican
leader's call for higher taxes on gasoline and also said President
Bush was not easing his opposition to Democrats' formula for
raising the minimum wage.
   ``We do not feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is
necessary at this time,'' said White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole had said Sunday that although
he still supports Bush's ``no new taxes'' pledge, he would back a
gasoline tax increase to rebuild the U.S. infrastructure _ such as
roads, bridges and other public facilities.
   However, Dole said he would not back a gas tax hike for deficit
reduction.
   On the minimum wage, Fitzwater said, ``We are not changing our
position at this point'' although he noted that White House chief
of staff John Sununu has been conferring on the issue with House
leaders.
   House Democrats are casting the minimum wage issue as a poor vs.
rich matter that, along with his demand for a capital gains tax
cut, leaves the president's allies a bit nervous.
   ``The issue has been greatly simplified, at least for a great
many of us,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., referring to a
new scaled-back Democratic proposal. ``It's time to change the
minimum wage; $4.25 over the next two years (from the current $3.35
an hour) is agreeable to me.''
   Domenici is among several Republicans and conservative Democrats
who last summer supported Bush's veto of a proposed increase to
$4.55 an hour by 1992, but who don't want to walk the plank again.
   ``They (the White House) know that things are moving away from
them,'' said Rep. Timothy J. Penny, D-Minn., one of 28 House
Democrats who supported Bush's veto. ``Everybody wants this to be
the last time we have to vote on his bill.''
   House Democratic leaders have scheduled a vote Wednesday on a
bill to raise the $3.35 wage floor, which has not changed since
1981, by 45 cents on Jan. 1 and by another 45 cents an hour in
January 1991, to $4.25.
   Meanwhile, the Senate will be asked Tuesday to adopt a
resolution condemning Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega's decision
last week to call off a 19-month cease-fire between Sandinista
forces and U.S.-backed rebels.
   Senate Democrats this week also will keep trying to prevent
Republicans from attaching a capital gains tax cut to legislation
providing a three-year aid package for Poland and Hungary or to a
bill raising the ceiling on the federal debt.
   ``Obviously, capital gains has nothing to do with aid to Poland
and Hungary,'' Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said Sunday
on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' program. ``I hope very much that
we'll be able to proceed.''
   Before turning to the minimum wage Wednesday, the House will
consider bills Tuesday appropriating $8.8 billion for the war on
drugs and banning smoking on all airline flights.
   House Democrats have given the administration until Tuesday to
either sign on to their minimum wage plan or face a new series of
claims that Bush is insensitive to the poor while also seeking to
cut the capital gains tax.
   Accepting a compromise would mean dropping Bush's ``first, best
and only offer'' vow to veto any increase to $4.25 in less than
three years. He also vowed to veto any bill that does not include a
sub-minimum ``training`` wage of $3.35 for any new hire for the
first six months.
   The new Democratic version includes a 60-day sub-minimum wage
applicable only to first-time workers with no previous job
experience. Democrats have indicated a willingness to add another
30 days to the training wage.
   Bush's aides are well aware that Republican lawmakers up for
re-election in a year are getting skittish. ``I don't think the
president would enjoy vetoing a second minimum wage bill,'' House
Republican Leader Bob Michel told reporters.
   Rep. Robert Wise, D-W.Va., suggested last week that Democrats
start referring to the minimum wage as a ``favorable minimum gains
treatment'' to contrast it with Bush's capital gains proposal that
would ``give the wealthiest 600,000 a $25,000 windfall.''
   The House already has approved the capital gains tax cut, an aid
package for Poland and Hungary and legislation raising the debt
ceiling to $3.1 trillion.
   Dole accused Democrats of ``obstructing any effort to bring up
capital gains.''
   ``Just give us a vote, that's our strategy,'' Dole said. ``Let's
vote Tuesday.''
   The current $2.87 trillion ceiling expires at midnight Tuesday,
but the Treasury Department was borrowing an emergency $17.6
billion today to keep the government in business for another week
and cover November Social Security checks.

   The main opposition leader, barely able
to file in time Monday because of a bomb threat and other delays,
accused the governing party of ``masterminding a plot'' to keep him
out of next month's elections.
   Analysts say the parliamentary elections Nov. 22, 24 and 26 may
be the closest since India gained independence from Britain 42
years ago.
   Vishwanath Pratap Singh, leader of the Janata Dal party, filed
his nomination papers in the Fatehpur district barely half an hour
before the deadline on a day filled with delay and diversion.
   He had been airborne 28 minutes when his plane, part of the
government-run Vayudoot Airlines fleet, returned to New Delhi
because of a bomb threat.
   Singh conducted a protest at the airport, United News of India
reported. After a three-hour delay, in which no bomb was found but
an unspecified technical problem was reported, the plane again took
off for Kanpur, the nearest airport to Fatehpur.
   After that, Singh had to drive two hours to reach Fatehpur in
time, an aide in New Delhi said.
   The 58-year-old opposition leader, a former ally of Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi who has served him as defense and finance
minister, claimed Gandhi's governing Congress Party was responsible.
   ``It is a defeat of the government,'' said N.C. Jain, a Janata
Dal official. ``He reached Fatehpur barely 30 minutes before the
nominations were to close, but he did it.''
   Both Gandhi and Singh are running for Parliament seats from
Uttar Pradesh state, east of New Delhi. Gandhi filed Oct. 24 as a
candidate in the Amethi district.
   Singh's charges are among several unrelated problems besetting
Gandhi.
   Last week, the forestry minister was accused of making improper
advances to an environmentalist. On Monday, the defense minister
refused to run for re-election to Parliament because, he said, ``an
inexperienced, non-political coterie'' of Gandhi aides would not
let have the district he wanted.
   As if his political difficulties were not enough, Gandhi's
dentist revealed that the prime minister had a serious toothache.
It came to light after Gandhi and several bodyguards were seen
arriving at the dentist's clinic Monday.
   Z.R. Ansary, the minister for environment and forests, was
accused by Mukul Dutta, 26, an environmental activist from the
Himalayan hills, of trying to molest her Oct. 9 in his office.
   She told a New Delhi news conference 2{ weeks later that Ansari
lunged at her, ``violently assaulting me in a most obscene and
degrading manner.''
   Ansari, 64, called the charge a politically inspired
fabrication. ``Even an insane sex maniac should be credited with
more intelligence'' than to attack a woman in his own office with
staff members nearby, he said Saturday.
   Defense Minister Krishna Chandra Pant said he wanted to run for
Parliament in Nainital, his home district in Uttar Pradesh, and
would not contest the New Delhi constituency to which he was
assigned.
   ``The revival of state party bossism and the unwarranted
interference of inexperienced non-political coteries in political
decision-making has been causing concern to all of us for some
time,'' Pant said in a letter to Gandhi.
   His reference was to a group of Gandhi's old school friends who
are closely involved in the campaign.

<TEXT>
   A handful of Chinese engineers in the United
States to aid a $600 million arms sale to China have returned to
work on the program, but the State Department said Monday that
weapons deliveries suspended by President Bush in June have not
resumed.
   Officials, responding to a report in the Los Angeles Times,
stressed that Bush had suspended shipments _ not ended them _ after
the Beijing government cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The Chinese engineers, who apparently did not leave the United
States over the summer, returned during the last few weeks to the
Grumman factory in Bethpage, N.Y., ``to provide technical support
which will enable U.S. work to continue during the suspension,'' a
State Department official said.
   The main parts of the deal with China are a program to improve
avionics on F-8 jets and the manufacture of torpedos, radar and
artillery ammunition.
   ``In view of the long-term interest of the United States, it has
always been the president's intention to suspend _ not terminate _
US-People's Republic of China FMS (foreign military sales)
programs, with the hope that circumstances would permit a
resumption of normal relations,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Still, the official added: ``There are no deliveries. The
president's decision remains in effect.''
   The sanctions imposed by Bush were considered inadequate by
several members of Congress who called for harsher measures as an
expression of U.S. human rights convictions.
   The bloody June 4 crackdown on students in Tiananmen Square in
Beijing was seen by millions of Americans on television,
contributing to public criticism here of the Communist government
as it reversed a moderating trend.
   But Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III emphasized
then that maintaining strong ties with Beijing was in the strategic
interest of the United States.
   Two other sanctions, apart from a halt to weapons deliveries,
have been reversed or watered down since June.
   The president's ban on the visit of high-level U.S. officials to
China did not preclude Baker from meeting with Qian Qichen, the
Chinese foreign minister, at a conference on Cambodia in Paris at
the end of July.
   Also, dependents of American diplomats who were evacuated from
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and U.S. consulates returned weeks
later.
   On Monday, former President Richard Nixon, the most prominent
American to visit China since the military crackdown, called on the
two nations to restore good relations and urged Chinese leaders to
shun the ``backwater of oppression and stagnation'' and respect the
yearnings of their people.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Nixon spoke with
Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft before he left
for China. However, Fitzwater said he did not know if Nixon was
carrying a letter from Bush to the Chinese leadership.
   Responding to Nixon's call for normalized relations between the
two countries, Fitzwater said:
   ``We have always said that we want to resume good relations with
China at some point. The question really is, when and under what
conditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached that
time and we have not seen the right conditions.''

   President Bush will make campaign stops in

   Bush will campaign in Richmond and Norfolk, Va., for GOP

N.J., for Rep. James Courter, according to spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater also said ``nothing's ruled out'' when asked about a
possible additional trip by Bush _ possibly on Sunday _ to New York
on behalf of GOP mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani.
   Asked about the hard-fought races in Virginia and New Jersey,
Fitzwater said, ``the president hopes to increase the odds for a

   Leftist guerrillas today
attacked the Defense Ministry and headquarters of the joint chiefs
of staff with homemade mortars, killing at least one person and
wounding five, witnesses said.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
rebels fired eight to 10 mortars from the beds of two trucks parked
300 yards from the heavily fortified military compound.
   Two of the mortars fell short and exploded at a gasoline
station, killing Ernesto Vasquez, 72, an attendant, as he was
filling up an automobile, the witnesses said. They said two other
attendants were wounded.
   The gas station was heavily damaged, but there was no fire.
   Another mortar exploded at a nearby fried chicken restaurant,
causing extensive damage and wounding one boy, the witnesses said.
   Two more mortars blew up at the entrance of the military
compound and three more exploded in a parking lot at a nearby
baseball stadium, wounding at least one soldier and one civilian,
the witnesses said.
   The military issued a statement that said one civilian was
killed and at least two injured in the attack.
   It said one of the injured was a civilian employee who worked in
the general staff headquarters of the Armed Forces high command.
   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, a military spokesman, said no
bombs fell inside the military compound. However, a soldier on duty
at the gate said two landed inside.
   The witnesses said they saw a wounded soldier, in combat dress,
being evacuated from the compound.
   The rebels staged a similar attack on the Defense Ministry
headquarters inside the compound Dec. 23, killing three people and
wounding 38.

   Helmeted Soviet police wielding truncheons charged
and clubbed demonstrators in Moscow tonight following a candlelight
vigil in memory of Stalin's victims. Scores of protesters were
knocked to the ground, beaten and dragged into police buses.
   About 1,000 Soviets converged at dusk on KGB headquarters in
central Moscow to mark the unofficial ``Day of the Political
Prisoner'' and mourn the millions wrongly imprisoned or killed
under the dictator Josef Stalin.
   Witnesses said the protest, which lasted about one hour,
proceeded peacefully.
   But then a splinter group of about 500 marched toward Pushkin
Square, a favorite site for human rights activists to gather. They
were attacked by police without warning.

<HEAD>Brzezinski: Soviets Should Take Responsibility for Katyn Massacre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KATYN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. National Security Adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski visited the site where more than 4,300 Polish
officers were slain in World War II, and he called on the Soviet
Union to take responsibility for the massacre.
   At the same time of Brzezinski's visit to the memorial to the
officers in the Katyn Forest, 17 miles south of the Byelorussian
city of Smolensk, a group of more than 400 Polish relatives of the
dead arrived for a commemorative Mass.
   ``It's purely a coincidence,'' Brzezinski said when asked if he
knew the Polish group was coming. He was visiting Katyn while in
the Soviet Union to participate in an East-West conference.
   A monument at the site pays tribute to the ``victims of Fascism
_ Polish officers shot by the Nazis in 1941.'' However, most Poles
and Western historians believe the officers, the cream of the
Polish intelligentsia, were killed by the NKVD, Stalin's secret
police, in 1940 after they were deported to Soviet Union following
the outbreak of World War II.
   The Nazis discovered the graves in 1943 and blamed the Soviet
Union, but the Soviets said the Nazis had murdered the men in 1941,
during the German army's march on Moscow.
   ``We owe it to the families of the victims to say that this was
done by Stalin and the NKVD,'' Brzezinski said.
   ``These victims represented a community of suffering shared by
the Polish and Soviet people ... the truth of what happened should
be a point of reconciliation for both countries,'' he said.
   A Soviet-Polish historical commission set up by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to
clear up historical ``blank spots'' has yet to deliver a final
verdict on the controversy, which for Poles remains their most
painful wartime memory.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in Warsaw
last week that the Soviet Union was still conducting investigations
and searching for documents, but that it was interested in finding
``the truth.''
   Many Poles hope the matter will be cleared up by the time Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki makes his first visit to Moscow in
November.
   The Polish side pre-empted a joint declaration on responsibility
in August when the Polish head of the commission, Jarema
Macizewski, said that documents show the Soviet Union was
responsible.
   Brzezinski, known for his staunch anti-communist views,
indicated he believed the Soviets would ultimately change their
version of the massacre.
   ``The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here
_ and the Soviets know my views _ is symbolic of the breach with
Stalinism that perestroika represents,'' Brzezinski said, referring
to Gorbachev's political and economic reform program.
   Until the Solidarity trade union was born in 1980-81, Katyn was
officially a taboo subject in Poland.
   But a group calling itself the Families of Katyn Victims has
thousands of members throughout Poland. More than 400 arrived in
Smolensk on the first special train organized by the Polish and
Soviet tourist agencies.
   It was the largest group of Poles ever to visit Katyn since
Soviet authorities began allowing Poles to visit in groups about
one year ago.
   ``We never thought we would be able to come here,'' said
Agnieszka Stawowczyk, whose father was killed at Katyn.
   Three priests celebrated Mass in front of a wooden cross, which
was surrounded by wreaths and Solidarity banners.

   Aspirants to top scientific jobs in the
federal government will not have to pass an ideological test on
abortion and other political issues, Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan says.
   Sullivan said in a speech Sunday at a meeting the Association of
American Medical Colleges that the so-called ``litmus test'' would
not be used to gauge applicants for jobs in his department.
   The secretary said the decision was meant to end the controversy
over such political tests and ``to clear the air and not have a
cloud hanging over these positions,'' according to The New York
Times.
   But Sullivan said it was ``necessary and proper'' for President
Bush to use the litmus test to fill top positions in the
administration, including those of HHS secretary and assistant
secretary for health, in order to select people who share his views.
   ``In the case of research administrators beneath that level,
however _ the leadership of the National Institutes of Health, the
Centers for Disease Control and other major federal agencies _ it
has been our policy that standards of scientific and administrative
excellence and leadership prevail in the selection process,''
Sullivan said.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Refugees Want Legal Status, End to Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Salvadoran refugees met on the
steps of the Capitol on Monday to demand legal status in the United
States, an end to aid to the government of El Salvador and support
for negotiations to end the 10-year-old war.
   The meeting marked an end to a five-week caravan by 25
Salvadorans to 68 cities to explain the plight of the thousands of
refugees seeking to remain in the United States.
   ``We applaud the passage of the ... bill in the House of
Representatives, which would temporarily give Salvadorans the right
to live and work legally in the U.S.,'' the group, calling itself
the Salvadoran Refugee Caravan, said in a prepared statement. ``We
call on the Senate to likewise approve this bill, as a humanitarian
gesture that is in accordance with the democratic values of this
country.''
   The Salvadorans also called on the United States to stop backing
the government of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, whose
party they said has ``direct ties to death squads.''
   ``U.S. aid to the Cristiani government also continues in the
face of stepped-up violence against the civilian population and any
political opposition,'' the statement said.
   The United States during the past decade provided the Salvadoran
government with economic and military assistance of more than $3
billion. The aid began shortly after Marxist-led guerrillas began
their war to topple the government in 1979.
   The group also said it sought the support of the Bush
administration for negotiations between the guerrillas, known as
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, and the Cristiani
government to end the war. Some 70,000 people, many of them
civilians, have been killed in the fighting.

<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Do you think of Iran as an enemy of the United States, or as
unfriendly but not an enemy, or as something else? Enemy: 47.
Unfriendly: 37. Other: 8. Don't know or no answer: 9.
   2. Do you think Iran supports terrorism around the world, or
not? Yes: 79. No: 9. DK-NA: 12.
   3. Do you think Iran has control over the people who are holding

   4. Should the United States offer to resume normal relations
with Iran if Iran gets the American hostages in Lebanon freed? Yes:
61. No: 29. DK-NA: 10.
   5. The United States has frozen $2 billion in Iranian assets in
U.S. banks. Should the United States release this money to Iran if
Iran gets the American hostages in Lebanon freed? Yes: 50. No: 37.
DK-NA: 13.
   6a. Some people say the United States should negotiate with the
people who are holding American hostages in Lebanon in order to win
their freedom. Others say negotiating would encourage more
hostage-taking. Do you think the United States should negotiate
with the people who are holding American hostages in Lebanon, or
not? Yes: 47. No: 45. DK-NA: 8.
   b. (If no) How about if negotiations were held through a third
party, such as the Red Cross _ would you support or oppose that?
Support: 55. Oppose: 37. DK-NA: 8.
   7. Do you think the United States should pay money to the
hostage-takers to free the American hostages in Lebanon? Yes: 10.
No: 85. DK-NA: 5.
   8a. Would you support or oppose the use of U.S. military force
in Lebanon in an effort to free the American hostages in Lebanon?

   A local official said today he is
considering rebuilding a bridge that collapsed, plunging five
people to their deaths, even though he has not obtained a
professional opinion about the tragedy's cause.
   The dead were among more than 30 people who witnesses said were
rocking the bridge back and forth just before it collapsed,
spilling the group into the Little Red River. Officials have
speculated that the swinging motion put tension on the cables
supporting the 77-year-old wood-decked structure and contributed to
the collapse.
   People ``were just running in the air,'' said Jennifer Johnson,
who was driving to her nearby home when she saw the accident.
   Of the 18 people injured, seven remained hospitalized today,
with conditions ranging from satisfactory to serious, authorities
said.
   The dead, who had gathered in a nearby town for a church
meeting, included three children.
   County officials as yet have not had an expert test the debris
to determine what happened.
   County Judge Harvey Adcock said today that he would seek a
historic preservation grant or some other funds to aid in
rebuilding the bridge, which has been on the National Register of
Historic Places since 1986. In Arkansas, the county judge has no
judicial power, but is chief administrator of county government.
   ``Everybody feels a great sense of loss now that it's gone,''
Adcock said.
   He said a state police investigator had looked at the site with
county officers, but Adcock didn't know whether the officer was an
engineer. The judge said he ``had the name and address of a private
engineer that will probably look at it.''
   A state Highway and Transportation Department engineer and an
engineer from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said their agencies
had no plans to get involved in the investigation, unless they were
asked.
   ``No one has contacted us. It's out of our jurisdiction,'' said
David Lambert, heavy bridge and maintenance engineer for the
highway department. ``I guess that's up to the Cleburne County
authorites on how they want to handle it. If we had a request to
look at it, it would be considered.''
   There were no signs at either end of the bridge setting capacity
limits or warning visitors against swinging the bridge, which was a
popular pastime among young people. Officials did not believe any
warnings were needed, Adcock said.
   ``If we would have had any inkling that it wasn't safe, we would
have had it shut down,'' Adcock said.
   Those on the bridge were attending an annual meeting of the Full
Holiness church movement at nearby Prim.
   Ms. Johnson said she saw the upstream side buckle. ``It just
turned upside down and fell into the river,'' she said.
   ``One girl said it felt like a dream until she hit the water,''
said Cindy Watkins, who had traveled from Oklahoma with her sister,
Vicki, for the church outing. ``Everybody was up there laughing and
then all of a sudden it screeches and pops. It was real scary.''
   Another member of the church group, Daniel Rafferty of Seymour,
Mo., said he saw the bridge being rocked as he arrived.
   ``We thought it was kind of fun and it scared some people,''
Rafferty said.
   It ``just happened so quickly that no one had a chance to cry
for help,'' he said. ``They didn't know what happened. It was pure
terror. Arms were flailing. People were panicking. Everyone was
trying to save themselves.''
   As crews worked with cranes and bulldozers to remove the debris,
residents brought flowers to lay at the foot of the bridge to
remember the victims.
   Among the dead was Gayla Carlton, the 34-year-old daughter of
the host pastor, the Rev. Vernon Carlton of Prim.
   Her uncle, Tony Carlton, had two teen-age daughters on the
bridge. Both survived.
   ``At bedtime last night I told my daughters, `Let's thank the
Lord that y'all made it one more time.' We knelt at the bedside and
prayed,'' Carlton said. ``I have feelings for the others. There's
no way I can explain it.''
   The others killed were Jason Williams, 16, of Muldrow, Okla.;
Dana Waltman, 11, of Vancleave, Miss.; David Shane Warren, 13, of
Mayfield, Ky.; and Catrina Cotrell, in her early 20s, of Stratford,
Okla.

   A launch team and five astronauts
successfully concluded a practice countdown Monday for a November
launch of the space shuttle Discovery, which will carry a secret
military payload.
   The exercise, which began Sunday, covered the final 24 hours of
an actual count and provided training for both ground controllers
and the astronauts, who were in the shuttle cockpit for the final
two hours.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said the exercise went well.
   In honor of Halloween, the astronauts wore costume hats and
carried artificial jack-o'-lanterns as they arrived at the launch
pad in their bulky orange pressure suits. Some pad workers wore
masks for the occasion.
   Discovery is scheduled to be launched Nov. 20 on the fifth of 32
shuttle flights assigned entirely to the Defense Department.
   For security reasons, officials will not disclose the nature of
the cargo or what experiments the space crew plans. Earlier
military missions have deployed reconnaissance and
intelligence-gathering satellites.
   Discovery's crew members are Air Force Col. Frederick C.
Gregory, the first black astronaut named to command a space shuttle
mission; Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot; and three mission
specialists, Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr.; F. Story Musgrave;
and Kathryn C. Thornton. Blaha replaced Navy Rear Adm. S. David
Griggs, who was killed June 17 in the crash of a private plane he
was piloting.

<HEAD>Most Californians Favor Sales Tax to Aid Quake Recovery: Poll</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `Gov. George...', to CORRECT that special session
proposed, not set for Tuesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Californians support a
temporary sales tax increase to finance earthquake recovery efforts
in the San Francisco area, according to a newspaper poll published
today.
   More than half the people polled also said the state should make
existing freeways safer rather than construct new ones to ease
traffic congestion, the Los Angeles Times poll found.
   And five out of nine people polled said transportation officials
should scrap plans to double-deck freeways, while 61 percent
replied the government has failed to adequately ensure freeway
safety.
   Gov. George Deukmejian, grappling with ways to finance recovery
from the 7.1-magnitude temblor Oct. 17, has recommended a special
session of the Legislature to discuss the quake aftermath. He
planned to meet with legislative leaders later today to determine
if such a session will be held.
   Of the 1,377 adults surveyed, 52 percent favored a temporarily
higher sales tax to pay for repairs and to aid victims, while 41
percent opposed the idea and 7 percent were undecided, the poll
found.
   On the average, people favoring the tax increase said they would
pay about one cent more on the dollar for about two years, which
would raise about $8.6 billion, according to the poll.
   In addition to an increased sales tax, which now ranges from 6
percent to 7 percent in different parts of the state, the governor
is considering an increase the 18-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax.
   The gas tax increase was opposed by 60 percent of the
respondents.
   On the question of highway safety, 57 percent of the respondents
opted for making existing roads safer, while 32 percent called for
building more highways and 11 percent said they were not sure, the
poll found.
   Even in traffic-plagued Los Angeles, earthquake-wary residents
favored by a 2-to-1 majority placing a higher priority on freeway
structural safety rather than on freeway expansion, according to
the poll.
   Half of those polled said they did not believe the collapse of
the double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland was due to faulty
construction or engineering incompetence.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the
appeal of a member of a secular group who argued that he should
have the same right to perform marriages as does a priest or rabbi.
   Roy Torcaso of Wheaton, Md., won an important victory in 1971,
when the high court held that Maryland violated his rights by
barring him from becoming a state-commissioned notary public
because he refused to declare a belief in God.
   In the current case, the justices, without comment, refused to
disturb a Virginia law favoring ordained ministers in officiating
at weddings. The court rejected Torcaso's arguments that the law
violates religious freedom and separation of church and state.
   He contended that his constitutional rights are being denied
because he is a counselor with the American Humanist Association,
an educational and philosophical organization.
   Torcaso said he is similar to a priest, minister or rabbi and
should have comparable rights. He has been allowed to officiate at
weddings in other states, he said.
   However, he was rejected in 1988 when he applied to Prince
William County, Va., to perform weddings there.
   A Virginia judge refused to overturn the county clerk's
rejection.
   Lawyers with the Virginia attorney general's office said the
state law requires a $500 bond by anyone who is not an ordained
minister and wants to officiate at a wedding.
   Ministers are exempt from posting the bond because ``ordination
creates a presumption that the officiant is trustworthy and
responsible,'' lawyers for the state said.
   Torcaso said he would have been barred under Virginia law from
performing the wedding even if he posted the bond. The bond
requirement, he said, applies only to judges or others who reside
in the county where they seek to perform the marriage.
   Torcaso said other states have similar laws, but that they more
liberally create exemptions that allow non-ministers to officiate
at weddings.
   The Constitution ``prohibits states from establishing religious
qualifications for persons who perform state functions,'' his
appeal said.
   ``States cannot impose religious affiliation and belief
requirements upon persons who solemnize marriages.''
   The case is Torcaso vs. Virginia, 89-375.

   Five inmates are missing following the
two-day rampage that was put down last week at the Camp Hill state
prison, authorities said today.
   State police and security personnel were continuing
building-by-building searches at the prison, said a statement
issued today by the Corrections Department. Two buildings have not
yet been searched. Also, a thorough search of the burned-out
modular housing units had not been completed.
   ``As of late last night, our inmate population count was off by
five. However, the sweeps will continue until the count is
reconciled,'' the statement said.
   The statement did not specify whether officials fear the missing
inmates are dead or escaped, except to say that there were no
reported breaches of the prison fences during the riot and that
security has remained heavy since. Inmates being kept in yards were
being closely supervised, the department said.
   Corrections Department spokesman Kenneth Robinson said no
possibilities had been ruled out _ including an escape, the deaths
of the inmates, a paperwork mistake in accounting for the men, or
the possibility that they are hiding somewhere on the prison
grounds.
   Several investigations are expected to begin this week as
officials try to determine the cause of the riots, including one by
an independent panel to be named by Gov. Robert P. Casey.
   On Sunday, Robinson said the situation at the prison was
``progressing and calm.'' He said 744 inmates had been transferred
to other state prisons since the prison unrest ended Friday.
   More than 100 people were injured during two nights of rioting
that left many of the prison's buildings unusable. Six inmates and
four prison staffers remained hospitalized Sunday.
   While the investigations at Camp Hill continue, authorities will
be investigating in Philadelphia, too, where inmates seized control
of a cellblock at Holmesburg Prison for about four hours Saturday
night. Corrections Commissioner J. Patrick Gallagher said he
intends to bring criminal charges against the inmates responsible
for the riot.
   Guards recaptured the city prison's ``I'' Block, fighting with
nightsticks as the prisoners fought back with homemade weapons,
Gallagher said. Behind the guards, firefighters sprayed water on
smoldering mattresses that had been torched by the inmates.
   During the Holmesburg riot, inmates could be heard shouting
``Camp Hill, Camp Hill.''
   After the riot was put down, 114 Holmesburg inmates and 47
guards were treated or examined at hospitals and nine inmates were
admitted. No guards were admitted, but three received severe
injuries including multiple broken bones and deep cuts, Gallagher
said.
   Yet another disturbance started Sunday night, when a small fire
was set in a trash can at the Northeast Detention Center in
Philadelphia. While the smoke was being cleared, about 100 inmates
were taken to a gymnasium.
   Four young men refused to return to their cells voluntarily,
forcing guards to ``escort'' them, according to a city police
detective who refused to give his name.

   Four people shouting ``burn, baby, burn,''
torched three American flags on the central steps of the U.S.
Capitol today in a bid to test the new federal law protecting the
national symbol from desecration.
   All four demonstrators were arrested by Capitol police.
   ``We defy your law,'' said Nancy Kent, a spokeswoman for the
flag burners, reading from a prepared statement.``We challenge you.
Arrest us. Test your statute. Take it back to the Supreme Court and
try once again to claim it is all consistent with your
constitutional standards of free speech.''
   The law, which President Bush allowed to take force without his
signature, went into effect at midnight on Friday.
   The flag-burning demonstration had been scheduled for noon on
the marble plaza of the Supreme Court. Organizers announced it had
been moved and led photographers and television cameras to the
Capitol steps.
   One demonstrator produced a flag and ripped it.
   Two policemen tore the pieces of the flag from his hands.
   Behind them another man produced a flag and set it afire.
   Two other flags also were set ablaze as the four demonstrators
chanted, ``Burn, baby, burn.''
   ``Another shouted: ``Stop the fascist flag law. Oppose it.''
   Policemen first attempted to extinguish the flames by stamping
on the flags, them aimed fire extinguishers at the burning
remnants, dousing them in a chemical stream and shrouding the scene
in white smoke.
   Police spokesman Dan Nichols said the four were identified as
Shawn Eichner, 24, of New York City; Gregory Johnson, 33, of
Richmond, Ind.; David Blalock, 39, of Johnstown, Pa., and Scott
Tyler, 24, of Chicago.
   The four were charged with violating the Flag Protection Act of
1989, demonstrating without a permit and diorderly conduct, Nichols
said.
   Violation of the flag statute provides a maximum penalty of one
year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The other two charges are
misdemeanors and carry respective maximum penalties of $300 and 90
days in jail and $250 and 90 days in jail.

<TEXT>
   The National Safety Council has issued the
following guidelines for parents and children at Halloween:
   _ Children's costumes should be large enough so that warm
clothing can be worn underneath, yet short enough so that a child
won't trip. Avoid shoes that make walking difficult.
   _ For visibility, use light colors in costumes and attach
reflective tape to them. Have children use reflective treat bags.
   _ Attach a small child's name, address and phone number inside
his sleeve in case he gets lost. But don't openly display the
personal information on the child's costume.
   _ Masks can obscure a child's vision. Use non-toxic makeup
instead.
   _ Be sure children travel only in familiar neighborhoods and
that they don't enter strangers' homes. They should follow a
designated travel route with a definite return time and not
trick-or-treat past dark. Give them coins to call home if any
problems arise.
   _ Remind children not to eat any treat before it's been
inspected by a parent.
   _ Teach children pedestrian safety.
   _ Motorists should slow down in residential areas and watch for
children.

   The White House on Monday defended anew
President Bush's abortion-related veto of the District of
Columbia's appropriations bill, which critics say has tied up funds
to battle drugs in the nation's capital.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would
sign the funding measure ``in a nanosecond'' if Congress would
strip language liberalizing funding for abortions in the district.
   Bush on Friday vetoed the district budget bill, including the
annual $435 million federal contribution to the city's $3.4 billion
budget.
   The bill would provide the city with an extra $32 million to
hire more police, build prison space, launch a drug treatment
initiative for pregnant women and other anti-drug activities.
   The 1989 murder rate in the city reached 369 over the weekend,
tying the 1988 record. Authorities say many of the slayings are
drug related.
   The measure would also lift a year-old restriction that bars the
district from spending locally raised tax dollars to provide
unrestricted abortions for poor women.
   Bush said Saturday in San Jose, Costa Rica, that abortion-rights
supporters were playing ``political games'' with the bill, and he
vowed to stand like ``a brick wall'' against efforts to lift
restrictions on abortion funding.
   ``The fact is the president vetoed it because of his beliefs on
abortion. That's the way it stands,'' Fitzwater said. ``All they've
got to do is strip that out, change the language back to the way it
was and we'll sign that bill in a nanosecond.''
   Fitzwater rejected the argument that the district should be free
to do as it pleases with its own tax dollars. Under the law
governing home rule for the district, Congress must approve the
entire D.C. budget, not just the federal contribution.
   ``It's all out of the federal money. It's federally
appropriated. Everybody tries to use that argument it's local
money. It's not,'' Fitzwater said.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League says 30 states and
the district pay for abortions through Medicaid only to save the
mother's life; eight states pay for abortions in cases of rape or
incest or certain other circumstances; and 12 states pay for
abortions deemed ``medically necessary.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the former two-time Democratic
presidential contender who has moved to the district from Chicago,
said Sunday that the veto demonstrates ``the colonial status of the
District of Columbia,'' and accused Bush of ``tyranny.''

<HEAD>Executive Loses Appeal of Apple Juice Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Beech-Nut executive fighting his
conviction for selling adulterated apple juice lost a Supreme Court
appeal today.
   The court, without comment, left intact John F. Lavery's
sentence of a year and a day in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   Lavery, former vice president in charge of operations for
Beech-Nut, was convicted last year in New York City of conspiracy
and mail fraud for selling as pure apple juice what essentially was
corn syrup.
   Government prosecutors said Lavery first was warned by a
Beech-Nut research director in 1977 that juice from its supplier,
Universal Juice Co., was adulterated. The prosecutors said many
similar warnings followed.
   Lavery did not fire Universal Juice Co. as supplier until 1982,
after a detective from the Processed Apple Institute told him
Beech-Nut was going to be hit with a lawsuit, the prosecutors said.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March rejected
Lavery's arguments that he improperly was convicted of conspiracy
and fraud.
   But the appeals court said, ``The evidence was ample to permit
the jury to infer that Lavery conspired with the suppliers to
perpetrate a fraud on the public through the distribution of the
adulterated juice.''
   Beech-Nut President Niels L. Hoyvald also was convicted. He
received the same sentence as Lavery but was not involved in the
appeal acted on today.
   Beech-Nut was fined $2 million after pleading guilty to selling
adulterated and misbranded apple juice.
   The case is Lavery vs. U.S., 89-216.

   The pilot of a training jet that crashed
into the USS Lexington, killing him and four others, was making his
first attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, the ship's captain
said today.
   The two-seat T-2 Buckeye, based at the Meridian, Miss., Naval
Air Station, slammed into the carrier's tower and cartweeled in
flames into the flight deck Sunday afternoon during a practice
flight about 30 miles south of here in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``As I see it,'' said Capt. C. Flack Logan, ``he ended up in a
position which in naval aviation is known as being `low and slow,'
which is a very terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a
ship.''
   As the World War II-vintage carrier, the oldest in the Navy,
returned to its dock late this morning, several sailors' wives
burst into tears and waved wildly as they spotted their husbands on
the deck _ the first confirmation that their loved ones were safe.
   ``We weren't sure what kind of news they were giving us,''
Kayleen Edwards said after finding her husband. ``They said they
had hit where he works, and they couldn't identify some of the
bodies.''
   Names of the dead were not released pending notification of next
of kin. One was a civilian worker, Logan said. In addition to the
five dead, 17 were injured, one critically.
   Logan said landing officers told the pilot, who was alone in the
plane, to add power and waved him off but for some reason he was
unable to comply. The man was a qualified pilot, Logan said, but
was only beginning to learn the difficult skill of landing on a
carrier.
   ``The nose pitched up and he lost control of his ability to fly
the aircraft and it went up and came into the island,'' Logan said.
   The plane was upside down when its wing tip hit the island, or
tower of the 46-year-old ship, the captain said. The jet then
smashed into the side of the island before crashing in flames on
the flight deck.
   The wing tip broke off and remained imbedded in the
superstructure today, but overall, damage to the ship was described
as minor. Three planes parked on the flight deck were hit by
debris. Logan said the damage to the planes was not severe.
   When the plane crashed, aviation fuel ignited on the
889-foot-long blacktop deck, but the fires were quickly brought
under control, said Navy Cmdr. Dennis Hessler.
   The ship, which came under a deadly Japanese kamikaze attack 45
years ago this week, has 1,440 crew members and is the Navy's only
aircraft carrier used exclusively for training. It is also the only
carrier on which women serve.
   Two of the 17 injured people were taken by helicopter to
hospitals in Alabama and Pensacola. Crew member Mark Anthony Lopez,
21, of West Valley, Utah, was listed in critical but stable
condition at University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile,
said Suzette George, nursing supervisor. He had burns over nearly
half his body.
   Crew member Sandra Bailey, of Haleyville, Ala., was admitted to
the U.S. Naval Hospital in Pensacola. Logan said her injuries were
not life-threatening.
   In Pensacola, relatives of crew members worried about finding
out who the casualties were.
   ``We're all just shaken. We don't know what to think one way or
the other. I just want to know something,'' said Cathy Webb, whose
boyfriend serves on the carrier.
   The crash occurred six days before the anniversary of the Nov.
4, 1944, attack that killed 47 and injured 127 on the ship in World
War II.
   The original crew plans to hold a reunion next weekend in
Pensacola.
   The Lexington was commissioned Feb. 17, 1943, and its planes
sank or destroyed more than a million tons of Japanese shipping and
1,039 enemy aircraft during World War II.
   The carrier was dubbed ``The Blue Ghost'' by Japanese
propagandist Tokyo Rose because she had reported it sunk several
times only to return to battle painted a solid blue-gray color,
unusual in wartime when ships are usually camouflaged.
   After the war, the Lexington was mothballed until being
reactivated in 1955. It reported to Pensacola on Dec. 29, 1962, to
serve as the Navy's training carrier. It is scheduled to continue
that role after moving next September to Corpus Christi, Texas.
   The ship has been a favorite of movie producers with roles in
the film ``Midway'' and the television miniseries ``War and
Remembrance.''

   A World Series victory gave
earthquake-battered Oakland something to celebrate today, and
thousands of hedonistic Halloween partyers helped San Francisco
return ``to abnormal.''
   ``A little happiness will help us bounce back,'' baseball fan
James Mead said after the Oakland Athletics beat the San Francisco
Giants 9-6 Saturday night to sweep the Bay Bridge World Series.
   About 300 A's fans showed up for a victory rally held this
morning in downtown Oakland's Jack London Square. A parade was
originally planned but the route down Broadway would have passed
several quake-damaged buildings and organizers did not want to tax
an already strained police department.
   The rally, featuring a moment of silence for quake victims, was
too subdued for some fans.
   ``I prefer a parade, but we'll take anything we can get,'' said
Theresa Held, whose childhood home in Santa Cruz was destroyed by
the quake. ``People need to get back on with everything, they
shouldn't dwell on the quake. I thought that's why they let the
series continue in the first place.''
   The A's opted for the rally after winning the series and avoided
the traditional champagne-spray locker room festivities out of
respect for the quake victims.
   The celebration was unabashed at this weekend's 10th annual
Exotic Erotic Ball in at the Concourse Exhibition Center in San
Francisco, where the popular attire was lace, leather, chains and
whips or next to nothing.
   ``The scare's over with. People want to get back to a routine,''
said Dagny Lancy, 21, of Penngrove, whose floral costume of a stem
and two blossoms was painted on and contained the barest stitches
of clothing.
   Tickets were $25, and organizers are donating 25 percent of the
proceeds to the disaster relief fund. As in the past, 15 percent is
going to AIDS foundations.
   Perry Mann, a producer of the ball, estimated the number of
people attending the Saturday night gala at 10,000-plus, but said
the exact payout to charities hasn't been determined yet.
   ``We're getting back to abnormal,'' said one of the revelers,
Wendy McMurry, 28, of Belmont.
   The 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Oct. 17, causing $7.1
billion in damage in the San Francisco Bay area and south through
Santa Cruz County.
   There had been 80 aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or greater, the
U.S. Geological Survey reported Sunday.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said 27,668 people had
registered at disaster centers for housing assistance, grants or
loans.
   People left homeless in Santa Cruz County demonstrated for
housing.
   The death toll stood at 64, including 39 motorists killed in the
collapse of Interstate 880 in Oakland.
   About 1,400 homes, 200 commercial buildings, and 12 city-owned
structures were also damaged in Oakland. Officials estimated the
building damage in Oakland at $1.3 billion.
   ``We're now looking at the long, slow, insidious damage,'' said
city emergency planner Jim Worlund. ``It's not dramatic, but it
requires people to move out of their homes.''
   The quake struck hard at those least able to afford it. Eight
low-rent residential hotels were condemned, putting about 800
people into the streets.
   More than 400 people took refuge in Oakland's five Red Cross
shelters.
   ``We'll be dealing with these folks for many months to come,''
said American Red Cross spokesman Joe McGraw.
   The California Department of Transportion, meanwhile, said the
damaged Bay Bridge won't be repaired until the end of November
rather than Nov. 16, as previously predicted.
   A 50-foot section of the upper deck fell during the quake.
Repair of the key commuter link between San Francisco and Oakland
will cost about $1 million, said Caltrans' Jim Larson.
   In San Francisco, the weekend brought more scenes of people
moving belongings out of damaged Marina district apartments or
picking through the rubble of demolished buildings for possessions.
   The public works department said the district sustained the
city's greatest damage. Seventy structures were considered unsafe.
   Dave Angelesco, 75, teetered atop a mountain of rubble that had
been his home for five decades. As he looked for important papers,
the retired coffee salesman lamented he would have to leave the
neighborhood he called ``close to heaven'' because rent on a new
place would be too high.
   Crews labored to replace gas lines in a system that once served
5,700 customers. Water and electricity were restored, but residents
were asked to limit use of appliances to avoid straining the system.
   ``There's only one guy out of 16 people staying here,''
psychologist Lori Rifkin said as friends lugged boxes to her car.
``I'm not staying here,'' she said, pointing to buckled concrete
and building cracks.
   Seventy miles to the south, hundreds of poor people left
homeless by the quake marched through Watsonville on Sunday to
demand that low-income housing be built to replace lost homes.
   City Manager John Radin said the city does not have the money to
build replacement housing.
   After the two-hour march, United Farm Workers leader Cesar
Chavez addressed several hundred people on a hill overlooking a
park where the homeless have been living in tents.
   ``We know that as soon as the publicity about the quake ends
that you could be abandoned. We don't want to let that happen,''
Chavez said.

<HEAD>Police Attack Protesters After Anti-KGB Rally; Scores Detained</HEAD>

   Helmeted riot police wielding truncheons
repeatedly charged and clubbed demonstrators Monday night after a
candlelight vigil outside KGB headquarters in memory of Stalin's
victims. Scores of protesters were knocked to the ground, beaten
and dragged into police buses.
   About 40 people were detained, the official Tass news agency
said, in what was the harshest crackdown on protesters in Moscow in
more than 1{ years. Tass said the protesters were ``trying to
create as much disruption as possible, to display anti-Soviet
posters and shout anti-Soviet slogans.''
   The clashes took place on some of central Moscow's busiest
streets and were especially jarring because of the more permissive
political climate instituted under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
wide-ranging reforms.
   About 1,000 Soviets converged on KGB headquarters at Dzerzhinsky
Square after dusk to mark the unofficial ``Day of the Political
Prisoner'' and mourn the millions who were wrongly imprisoned or
killed under Josef Stalin.
   The hour-long protest, in which two rows of people holding
flickering candles lined up on three sides of the building,
proceeded peacefully. It had been organized by the Memorial
Society, which seeks to commemorate those who suffered unjustly
under Stalin, and the Democratic Union, a self-styled opposition to
the Communist Party.
   At the end of the demonstration, a splinter group of about 500
people, mostly young men, marched off in the direction of Pushkin
Square, a favorite rallying site for human rights activists.
   Chanting, ``Shame on the KGB!'' and ``The KGB is the enemy of
the people!'' the group was confronted without warning by riot
police two blocks from Pushkin Square as they passed out leaflets
to homebound commuters.
   The white-helmeted police, armed with long black rubber
truncheons, formed a line, then waded into the protesters, clubbing
at least four of their leaders to the ground, then dragging them
into nearby buses for detention.
   The demonstrators retreated, then formed again and headed to
Gorky Street, the main thoroughfare leading to Pushkin Square. The
riot police and other uniformed officers sealed off the square and
split the protesters into two groups.
   On Gorky Street, riot police again charged the demonstrators,
taking about six into custody. As the protesters were dragged to
the buses, spectators shouted: ``Shame! Shame!'' Several passers-by
spat at a police car.
   Another group of demonstrators, gathered on the southeast side
of Pushkin Square, was also repeatedly charged by riot police, who
ignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporters
who flocked there.
   Police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gathered
under a Gorky Street archway, and dozens were seized bodily and
dragged away to the waiting buses.
   It was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned demonstration
in Moscow since December 1987, when about 200 burly men in civilian
clothes roughed up Jews who staged a protest demanding the right to
emigrate on the eve of Gorbachev's departure for his Washington
summit with Ronald Reagan.
   The 6 p.m. protest outside KGB headquarters began quietly as
dozens of regular uniformed police watched the demonstration and
directed traffic around Dzerzhinsky Square. At the center of the
square is a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Soviet
secret police.
   The demonstrators held candles and signs saying, ``Shame on the
KGB Executioners'' and ``Down with the KGB.''
   They originally had planned to circle the building, which houses
the infamous Lubyanka prison where Soviets declared ``enemies of
the people'' under Stalin were executed by being shot with a pistol
in the back of the head. But police sealed off one side of the
building to allow pedestrian and vehicular traffic to pass.

   Firefighters aided by decreasing winds
worked today to surround a wildfire that charred more than 4,000
acres and forced 2,200 campers to flee, a spokeswoman said.
   A million-dollar estate and another home under construction
burned Sunday, but there was no immediate estimate of total damage,
officials said. Among those who left their homes when the fire
threatened areas in and around this celebrity enclave was
entertainer Dick Clark, according to a neighbor.
   The fire, which broke out about 5 a.m. Sunday in the Santa
Monica Mountains north of here, was caused by a power line that was
blown down by the wind, said Vicki Crabtree, a Ventura County
dispatcher. And the same fierce Santa Ana wind helped fan the
flames Sunday before dying down today.
   Firefighters surrounded 80 percent of the blaze by early today,
Ms. Crabtree said. At one point during the morning, officials
declared the fire surrounded, but Ms. Crabtree said that
firefighters decided later to again describe it as only 80 percent
contained because some hot spots were causing problems.
   ``We still have wind conditions, but not as drastic as Sunday,''
she said this morning. Gusts had gone as high as 40 mph or more
Sunday; Ms. Crabtree did not have an exact wind speed figure this
morning.
   The fast-moving fire sent out thick, dark smoke that forced
closure for a time of 10 miles of the busy Pacific Coast Highway.
   Jo Ann Malac, a neighbor of Clark's, said she took her dog and
fled in her car. ``I freaked out. We were both screaming and
barking,'' she said. She got behind another car going down a road
toward the ocean, and in her panic ``I thought, God, he's not going
fast enough,'' she said. She said she later learned the other
driver was Clark.
   The fire left a barren trail similar to a moonscape. Up to 570
firefighters from Los Angeles and Ventura counties battled the
blaze while four air tankers and six helicopters bombed a two-mile
front of flames with retardant and water.
   ``We don't have access to the water up in those canyons. We are
fighting it mainly from the air,'' said another fire spokeswoman,
Sandy Wells.
   A pillar of smoke blew over the ocean north of Malibu and could
be seen for 30 miles to the south. Residents in the area hosed down
the roofs of their homes, while charred trees and smoldering brush
lined the coastal highway.
   In other areas, flames burned down to the ocean's edge, where
they were extinguished by waves.
   About 2,200 people were evacuated from five area campgrounds,
including 100 children from the Hess Kramer Jewish Temple Camp.
   The 12- and 13-year-olds were on a three-day weekend retreat,
said camp coordinator Paul Kipness.
   ``There wasn't time to be scared; you could see the smoke,''
Kipness said. ``The kids responded very well.''
   Farther inland, firefighters contained a 376-acre blaze in the
Black Canyon-Box Canyon area near Simi Valley Sunday afternoon,
said fire spokeswoman Virginia Dillard. No structures were burned
and there were no injuries.
   The Simi Valley fire moved east along Black Canyon, away from
the city of Simi Valley, before it was contained, Ms. Dillard said.
The closest densely populated area, the unincorporated Susana
Knolls, was not threatened.
   The Santa Ana winds that pushed the fires Sunday rose from a
surface-level high pressure system in the Pacific Northwest that
sent air racing toward lower air pressure in the southwest.
   Such winds pick up speed and heat as they run over the
southwestern deserts, canyons and mountain passes, and can reach
speeds of up to 100 mph in isolated mountain passes, said National
Weather Service meteorologist Bill Hoffer.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Resume Chemical Weapons Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet and U.S. officials opened talks
Monday seeking to resolve differences in proposals to reduce their
chemical weapons arsenals.
   Moscow wants a ban on the production of poison gas but the Bush
administration wants to continue producing chemical weapons even
after an international treaty calling for their destruction is
signed.
   The Soviets say they have stopped producing chemical weapons and
will begin unilaterally destroying their stockpile.
   The 40-nation U.N. Disarmament Conference in Geneva, which
includes the United States and Soviet Union, has a long-standing
consensus that production of poison gas should end when a treaty to
ban the weapons takes effect.
   Experts on chemical weapons fear that if the United States
continues to make chemical weapons, Third World nations will be
encouraged to build chemical factories capable of producing poison
gas.
   The superpowers hope that if they can agree to scrap most of
their chemical weapon stockpiles, they will spur global acceptance
of a treaty banning poison gas.
   Five days of talks opened Monday in New York, said U.S.
spokeswoman Caroline Dulin. Max Friedersdorf leads the U.S.
delegation, and Sergei Batsanov is the chief Soviet negotiator.
   Diplomatic sources said the talks were being held at the U.S.
and Soviet missions to the United Nations.
   The negotiators will discuss the exchange of information on
their chemical weapons capabilities and inspections of military and
civilian factories and storage sites.
   Dulin said the talks also would take up the differences in the
Soviet and U.S. approaches to scrapping chemical weapons.
   These are the first negotiations since September, when President
Bush and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze unveiled
competing proposals to scrap the weapons.
   On Sept. 25, Bush offered to cut U.S. chemical weapons
stockpiles by 80 percent if the Soviets reduce their arsenal to the
same level. Moscow says it has 50,000 tons of poison gas.
   U.S. stockpiles are estimated at about 30,000 tons of nerve gas
and the agreement would leave the United States and Soviet Union
each with about 6,000 tons.
   Shevardnadze on Sept. 26 said the superpowers should go further.
He challenged Washington to agree to stop making all types of
poison gas, including binary weapons, which are harmless until two
chemicals are combined just prior to use of the gas shell.
   Congress has approved funds to continue production of binary
poison gas bombs and shells, and administration officials say they
intend to continue production of the safer shells even after
signing a treaty phasing out the weapons.
   The Pentagon wants to replace its single-element gas shells with
binary weapons. The single-element shells are extremely dangerous
if they leak, which sometimes occurs because of aging or damage.
   Bush proposed an agreement to begin cuts at once while an
international treaty is worked out in which the United States would
destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over eight years if the
Soviets joined the ban.
   The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban.
   A conference of more than 145 nations in Paris in January called
for a comprehensive, verifiable treaty to ban chemical weapons.
   The Geneva Protocol of 1925, adopted after 1.3 million people
were killed or injured by poison gas in World War I, banned the use
of such weapons in war, but allows their manufacture and possession.
   Iraq's repeated use of poison gas in its eight-year war with
Iran brought brought international attention to the issue.
   The United States resumed production of chemical weapons in 1987
after their manufacture had been banned in 1969. The Reagan
administration said new weapons were needed to match growing Soviet
stockpiles.

   The Supreme Court, in a case closely watched
by civil rights groups, was asked Monday to decide whether federal
courts can order higher taxes to finance school desegregation.
   The state of Missouri urged the justices to invalidate a federal
judge's 1987 order that doubled local property taxes in Kansas
City, saying it was ``taxation without representation.''
   H. Bartow Farr III, an attorney for the state, argued that
courts lack the power to impose or authorize higher taxes even to
correct a constitutional violation such as racial discrimination in
schools.
   ``There is no power to tax, period,'' Farr told the justices.
   Although constitutional issues dominated the 60-minute session,
lawyers for both sides answered questions by several justices about
a possible procedural flaw that could preclude a ruling on the tax
issue in the case.
   The school district and parents of a group of school children,
who brought the original desegregation case in 1977, contend the
state waited too long to file a Supreme Court appeal.
   The school district asked the court to affirm a decision by the
8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the property tax
increase ordered by U.S. District Judge Russell Clark.
   The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in the case by
next July.
   Allen Snyder, the school district's attorney, said it would be
``dangerously wrong'' to deny federal courts the broad powers
needed to implement their orders to correct constitutional
violations.
   Striking down the tax order, he contended, would permit state
property tax law and local voters to frustrate the constitutional
rights of Kansas City's minority schoolchildren to an equal
educational opportunity.
   Federal courts, Snyder argued, ``have the powers and have the
duty to use their equitable discretion'' to remedy constitutional
wrongs.
   Several justices questioned whether there were any limits on the
powers of the federal courts to correct racial segregation in
schools. At one point, Justice Antonin Scalia asked if a court
could order higher taxes to ``gold plate all the schools?''
   Snyder discounted the justice's example but said a court's
remedy to constitutional violations was limited to what was
``feasible and practicable.''
   Justice Anthony Kennedy described the judge's tax order as a
``drastic remedy'' and questioned whether the district court should
have made an ``explicit finding'' that higher taxes were the only
reasonable solution.
   The state, in response to questions by Justice Sandra O'Connor,
maintained that the judge had failed to consider other options,
such as scaling back the desegregation plan. One alternative
opposed by the state, Farr conceded, was to require the state of
Missouri to pay all of the costs.
   Clark ordered the tax increase in September 1987 after the local
school district was unable to pay its share of a $400 million
desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements in
buildings and establishment of special ``magnet'' schools.
   State law says local property taxes can be raised only with
voters' approval, and in some instances only with a two-thirds
majority. District voters had not approved a levy increase since
1969, with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to
finance the desegregation plan.
   The appeals court, in August 1988, upheld the district court's
authority to order an increase in the property tax but changed the
procedure for imposing the higher tax levy in the future.

<HEAD>Soviet Human Rights Activist Considers Visiting Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who
spent nine years in Soviet prisons, is considering visiting Moscow,
a spokeswoman said Monday.
   Sharansky was considering the offer from the Jewish
Confederation of the Soviet Union, a newly formed umbrella group
for Soviet Jewish organizations, to visit Moscow in December, said
the spokeswoman, who insisted on anonymity.
   She was speaking from the Jerusalem-based Soviet Jewry Zionist
Forum headed by Sharansky.
   Sharansky told the Maariv newspaper that he was interested in
visiting Moscow to encourage Jewish emigration to Israel, but was
concerned that publicity from his trip might benefit President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I have no special nostalgia for the Soviet Union,'' Sharansky
said. ``My consideration to return and visit there will be if such
a visit would help our struggle to encourage the Jewish awakening.''
   ``I know that Gorbachev can benefit from a visit like that and I
have to consider who would gain more, Soviet Jews or Gorbachev,''
he said.
   In the early 1970s, Sharansky was a member of the Helsinki
Committee, a human rights watchdog group headed by Nobel Prize
laureate Andrei Sakharov.
   Sharansky made contacts with foreign journalists in Moscow and
gained prominence as a spokesman for organization. He also
championed the Soviet Jewry emigration movement.
   He was denied an exit visa to join his wife, who left for Israel
a day after their wedding in 1974. In March 1977, he was arrested
and in 1978 convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13 years in
prison.
   He spent nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps, becoming
a symbol of the Soviet Jewry's plight thanks to the efforts of his
wife, Avital, who tirelessly campaigned on his behalf in the West.
   Sharansky was freed on Feb. 11, 1986, when he came West on
Berlin's Glienicke Bridge. Included in the swap were Wolf Georg
Frohn of East Germany, Jaroslave Jaworski of Czechoslovakia and
Dietrich Nistroy of West Germany, who were released by the East,
and Jerzy Kaczmarek of Poland, Yevgeni Semliakov of Soviet Union,
Detlef Scharfenorth of East Germany and Karl F. Koecher of
Czechoslovakia and his wife, Hana, who were released by the West.
   At first, Sharansky kept a low profile in Israel. But he emerged
last year to found the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, a lobby group
seeking to improve conditions for immigrants from the Soviet Union.
   He also heads the Council of New Immigrants' Organizations,
which represents 18 groups uniting immigrants from 40 countries.
   Sharansky told Maariv he believed the Soviets would issue him a
visa.
   ``The Russians are making efforts to cut themselves off from the
past. Yuri Orlov, also an activist of the Helsinki Committee ...
has recently visited the Soviet Union despite once being convicted
as an enemy of the state, and faced no problems,'' Sharansky said.
``This is not what may prevent my visit.''

   The State Department criticized on Monday the
crackdown by Czech authorities on protesters who staged a
pro-democracy demonstration over the weekend.
   Police arrested about 350 demonstrators, who participated in a
march commemorating the 71st anniversary of the founding of the
first independent Czech republic.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States deplores the actions of the Czech government, which
``seriously call into question its stated interest in improving
U.S.-Czechoslovakian relations.''
   She said that ``the people of Czechoslovakia know what democracy
is and they want it now.''
   ``The U.S. calls on the government of Czechoslovakia to respect
the rights of its citizens and to institute the basic freedoms
desired by the Czechoslovakian people,'' she said.
   Asked about indications of reform in Bulgaria, Ms. Tutwiler said
the administration welcomes them but added that Bulgaria still lags
behind the leaders of reform in Eastern Europe.
   Among other measures, Bulgaria has indicated it will lift some
restrictions on the activities of independent environmental
activists and is liberalizing passport laws.
   Ms. Tutwiler, asked about signs of increased public debate on
government policy in East Germany, expressed hope that this is
another indication that the government is sincere about taking
steps to meet the wishes of the people for reform.
   ``We will continue to watch developments in East Germany very
closely, particularly overtures made by the regime to the
opposition,'' she said.

   The United States and West Germany have
reached an agreement that commits the German civil sector to
support the U.S. Armed Forces in the event of war or other crisis,
the Pentagon announced on Monday.
   The West German support covers such things as the transport of
personnel and supplies, telephone and teletype equipment,
construction equipment, maintenance and repair services, and
civilian labor, among other things, a Pentagon statement said.
   The latest agreement, reached in Bonn, West Germany, on Oct. 24,
is the culmination of a series of so-called ``host nation'' support
arrangments to improve the defense capabilities of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Under the agreements that date back to 1982, the United States
promised to reinforce the military units stationed in West Germany
with combat divisions and air squadrons, while the West German
government agreed to create military units to support U.S. forces
and to provide the additional support from the German civilian
sector, the statement said.
   The statement called the U.S.-West German series of agreements
the most extensive such commitment within the NATO alliance.

   Chicago _ hog butcher for the world, tool maker,
stacker of wheat ... and global fashion capital? Ed Koch _ U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations? The newest fast food chain _
McSushi?
   Do not adjust your set. You have entered the strange zone, a
collection of forecasts, ostensibly culled from a survey of
American witches by very serious folks at the New York Center for
the Strange.
   Each year at Halloween, the center, which claims to be a
non-profit organization involved in research, publishes a list of
predictions based on a poll of 300 witches.
   Associate research director Lewis Scott insists these are not
cackling types on brooms, but instead include a New York real
estate tycoon, several members of Congress and the wife of a
television evangelist.
   In addition to predicting that Chicago will replace Paris as a
center for haute couture, Koch will become a diplomat and raw fish
will be an even faster food than hamburgers, this year's survey
finds that:
   _ Vice President Dan Quayle will write a book of rhymes for
preschoolers.
   _ Geraldo Rivera will claim he was captured by visitors from
outer space.
   _ There will be nationwide shortages of herring, banjos,
billiard balls and Marilyn Quayle posters.
   _ A new book will claim that Zsa Zsa Gabor was born and raised
in Houston.
   _ The Japanese will market a line of large laptop computers for
obese traveling executives.
   The Strange people claim a track record. In previous years, they
predicted Richard Nixon's resignation, new freedoms for Eastern
Europe and low ratings for Pat Sajak's talk show, they say.
   But a look at predictions from 1987 does not inspire confidence.
   Remember when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appeared
in a Jane Fonda workout video? No? Remember when Michael Jackson
tried to adopt Jim and Tammy Bakker, or when Oliver North started a
chain of military summer camps? Maybe your were out of town that

   Who pounds the pavement the fastest?
New Yorkers? Bostonians? Guess again.
   A magazine survey claims that people in Springfield walk faster
than their counterparts in 36 other U.S. cities.
   The results of the survey in the October issue of Psychology
Today were a surprise for just about everybody, including the
surprisingly fleet-footed residents of this western Massachusetts
city and the people who conducted the study.
   ``It's not the first city you would think of,'' said Robert
Levine, a psychology professor at California State University at
Fresno who conducted the survey. ``But I had a pretty good idea
some city in the Northeast would be No. 1 and Springfield just
edged out Boston.''
   In his 1987 survey, Levine found that Springfielders covered 60
feet of sidewalk in an average of 11.1 seconds. They covered the
distance 3.6 seconds faster than their counterparts in Fresno,
Calif., which finished at the bottom of the list, he said.
   ``I don't know how fast they walk in other cities, but some days
it can be like a blur on this corner,'' said Sally Padilla, who
operates a hot dog stand across from Court Square in Springfield.
   Not everyone on the sidewalks here was willing to buy Levine's
results. Among the doubters was Stephanie Stevens, a parking
enforcement officer for 19 years.
   ``I don't see anyone running or walking fast, unless they see
me,'' she said.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Voters Gave Socialists a Warning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By returning the Socialists to power with
only a one-seat majority in Parliament, voters warned Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez to change the way his government runs the
country, analysts said Monday.
   The victory was the third straight for Gonzalez, a 47-year-old
labor lawyer who became prime minister in 1982 and has presided
over the fastest growing economy in Europe.
   El Pais, the nation's leading daily newspaper, said in an
editorial: ``The voters have clearly decided they want to continue
to be governed by the Socialists. But they demand, no less clearly,
a change in style.''
   It said the results of Sunday's election showed the public
agreed with those who accuse the government of not meeting the
demands of labor, allowing public services to deteriorate and
showing arrogance in its exercise of power.
   Defections to the left reduced the Socialists to 176 members in
the 350-seat Cortes, the lower house of Parliament where the power
lies, eight fewer than in 1986. Their share of the popular vote
fell from 43.4 percent to 39.55.
   The chief beneficiary of the 800,000-vote decline in Socialist
support was the United Left coalition of the Communists and other
parties, which doubled its 1986 tally and gained 10 seats for a
total of 17.
   Conservatives of the Popular Party gained one seat to 106. The
Democratic Social Center of former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez won
14 seats, down five from 1986.
   Socialist losses were most striking in cities, where the
deterioration and overloading of public services has become most
evident.
   For the first time since Spain returned to democratic government
after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, the
Socialists lost to the conservatives in Madrid and the surrounding
area.
   Julio Anguita, Communist leader of the United Left, campaigned
against economic policies that emphasize economic growth over
government spending as the way to reduce an unemployment rate of 17
percent, highest in Europe.
   Anguita, former mayor of Cordoba, said a general strike that
virtually shut down the country Dec. 14 demonstrated disappointment
with Gonzalez' pro-business strategy.
   Surveys indicate, however, that most Spaniards believe they live
better today than in 1982, when Gonzalez took office and faced a
stagnant economy, with annual inflation of 14 percent. Inflation is
7 percent, up two points from last year.
   ABC, a conservative daily, called the vote ``a tough electoral
lesson'' for the Socialists, and the new, left-of-center El Mundo
said: ``The Socialists will have to govern in a different way.''
   El Periodico de Cataluna, a Barcelona paper, said the Socialists
must do a better job of ``sharing the pie of well-being with those
who are less fortunate.''
   On Spanish National Radio, Education Minister Javier Solana said
the government got the message.
   ``We would be a politically insensitive party if we didn't learn
the lessons taught by the election results,'' he said. ``Will we go
in the direction of more social spending? Within the possibilities,
obviously yes.''
   Solana said spending on social programs in the past two years
had grown 60 percent faster than the economy, which has averaged
nearly 4.5 percent annual growth.
   ``Since the economy can now continue to grow, we expect social
spending to follow suit,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Document Gives New Details of Unsuccessful Plea Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Then-President Reagan personally approved a plea
bargain offered to Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos three days before
they were indicted in October 1988, Mrs. Marcos' attorney says in
court papers.
   The papers add detail to reported failed negotiations just
before the deposed Philippine leader and his wife were charged with
siphoning more than $100 million out of their country's treasury
and into the United States.
   Marcos died Sept. 28. His wife awaits trial at U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
   Mrs. Marcos' lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, said in the papers filed
last month that government lawyers made the plea offer during a
meeting at the Justice Department in Washington attended briefly by
U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
   ``The attorney general started the meeting by advising us that
the president was aware that the meeting was taking place, and what
would be conveyed to us during the conference had the president's
full knowledge and approval,'' Hibey said.
   While the personal attention of the president in a criminal case
is unusual, White House involvement can be expected in sensitive
matters that carry implications for U.S. foreign policy, government
spokesmen said.
   ``It's not usual for the White House to be involved in the
conduct of cases. It's not usual for the attorney general to be
involved in the handling of criminal cases,'' Dave Runkel, Justice
Department spokesman, said Monday. ``But there are those times when
issues do rise to the level of the attorney general or the White
House.''
   Runkel and Reagan's spokesman, Mark Weinberg, declined to
comment on the Marcos case because it is pending in the courts.
   Marcos, who died Sept. 28, and his wife were charged in a
racketeering indictment Oct. 21, 1988, three days after the meeting
described by Hibey.
   The trial of Mrs. Marcos and her other co-defendants, including
Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, is scheduled to begin March 14.
   Hibey's account of the meeting said Thornburgh left after
telling Hibey and another Marcos attorney, John Bartko, that the
other government officials at the meeting were the ``sole
representatives'' of the government in the matter and urging them
to consider the offer seriously.
   The representatives were Mark Richard, a Justice Department
official, then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Charles LaBella, he said. LaBella is prosecuting the case.
   After Thornburgh's departure, Giuliani described a
``nonnegotiable proposal with respect to the disposition of
proposed charges against our clients which the government intended
to present to the grand jury in the Southern District of New York
...,'' Hibey said.
   Giuliani said he would bring the indictment unless the Marcoses
agreed to his proposal by the end of the business day of Oct. 20,
1988, according to Hibey. He did not provide any details of the
government's proposal.
   LaBella said he would not comment on Hibey's account. ``I'm not
going to confirm that it's accurate,'' he said.
   Published reports at the time of the indictment, citing
unidentified sources, said the offer called for Marcos to forfeit
millions of dollars worth of real estate, artwork and jewelry in
return for a recommendation that he be spared a prison sentence.
   Hibey's statement was filed in connection with a pretrial motion
that seeks thousands of confidential government documents that Mrs.
Marcos' lawyers say they need to prepare her defense.
   His description of the Oct. 18, 1988, meeting was included in a
section that claimed a number of government agencies, including
``the highest levels of the Department of Justice,'' participated
in the investigation.
   Bartko, in a separate statement in the filing, said Mrs. Marcos'
lawyers were seeking documents that might show prior U.S. knowledge
of the Marcoses' allegedly illegal behavior; knowledge that the
Marcoses had substantial assets other than those in the indictment;
and U.S. participation in the overthrow of the Marcos regime.
   In response papers, LaBella, called the request ``a fishing
expedition.''
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan has yet to rule on the request.

   The percentage of blacks among the nation's
military recruits has dropped since 1980 but minorities continue to
be overrepresented in America's armed forces, said a congressional
report released Monday.
   Other changes found by the Congressional Budget Office, which
conducted the study of the nation's all-volunteer armed services,
included an improvement in standard military test scores and
educational background of the current recruits.
   ``These results, like those for race, represent a considerable
change from the beginning of the decade, when testing problems and
recruiting difficulties resulted in large numbers of low scorers
and non-graduates being accepted for military service,'' said the
study.
   ``The Army achieved particularly impressive gains,'' said the
report, ``Social Representation in the U.S. Military.''
   In 1980, less than 70 percent of active-duty recruits for the
four services _ Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps _ had high
school diplomas. Only 55 percent of Army recruits could lay claim
to a secondary school degree.
   But seven years later, 94 percent of active-duty recruits for
the four services had high school diplomas, as did about 91 percent
of Army recruits.
   About two-thirds of the recruits scored above average in
comparison to the general youth population on the standard military
entrance exams, the study said.
   On the issue of minorities among the recruits, the study found
that between 1980 and 1987, the percentage of blacks among recruits
with no prior military service fell by nearly 3 points _ 22.3
percent to 19.7 percent. In comparison, there was an increase of
almost 1 percentage point in enlistment-age youths who are black.
   Contributing to the decline was the Army, where the share of
black recruits fell by more than 6 percentage points.
   The study also found that black recruits come disproportionately
from sections of the country with above-average black incomes and
better-educated black adults. In 1987, only 44 percent of the black
male active-duty recruits came from areas in the bottom half of the
income distribution for black families.
   Women accounted for less than 13 percent of active-duty recruits
in 1987, a slight drop from the 14.2 percent in 1980. The CBO
attributed the somewhat steady total to the limited number of
military jobs for women.
   The CBO said the purpose of the study was to provide an
objective analysis and not reach any conclusions about current
patterns of representation and ways to change them.
   However, the study did say that instituting a draft would not
change the social composition of the military unless enlisted
strengths were significantly increased.
   ``The all-volunteer force is doing a good job of attracting a
broad cross-section of American youth,'' said Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on
manpower and personnel and the lawmaker who requested the study.
   The study, Glenn said, ``fills a major gap in our knowledge
about who is attracted to the volunteer military.''

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Laws on Amnesty, Creates State Auditor's Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Monday approved
legislation granting amnesty to many people convicted of crimes
punishable by less than three years in prison, and it created an
office to control government and party finances.
   The laws, to take effect in November, were among several items
on the agenda on the opening day of the legislature's first session
since it rewrote the communist constitution to reflect democratic
ideals.
   Hungary's rapidly evolving reform course has put it in the
vanguard of democratic change within the Soviet bloc, along with
Poland, the first Warsaw Pact nation with a government not
dominated by the communists.
   At its last sitting, which ended Oct. 20, Hungary's Parliament
adopted a series of laws and constitutional amendements
establishing the legal framework for the first multiparty elections
since the now defunct Communist party consolidated power in 1948.
   The Communist Party _ formally known as the Hungarian Socialist
Workers' Party _ dissolved itself Oct. 7 at a historic congress
that gave birth to its successor, the Socialist Party. The new
party, which professes democratic ideals, retains political
control, but its leaders have promised to hand over power if
defeated at the polls next year.
   In another major move to break with the Communist past, acting
President Matyas Szueroes proclaimed the existence of the Republic
of Hungary Oct. 23, the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist
revolt.
   The proclamation, which formally terminated the
Communist-created People's Republic of Hungary, was cheered by more
than 100,000 Hungarians.
   The amnesty law applies to those serving terms of three years or
less who are in the following categories: pregnant women, women
with children under 14 living with them, women over 55 and men over
60, and those suffering from terminal illness. The terms are halved
for those in these categories serving sentences exceding three
years.
   The amnesty does not apply to those facing or serving sentences
for violent or sexual crimes.
   Creation of an auditor's office was meant to re-establish
impartial control over government and party spending which was
effectively abolished after the communists took over. The office,
which also has jurisdiction over the finances of state enterprises,
is responsible to Parliament.
   The number of legislators present to vote on the two bills
differed, accounting for the different totals.
   Tuesday's agenda included a decision on when and how to chose a
president, whose responsibilities include command of the armed
forces and other major tasks.
   The newly created post was originally to be filled Nov. 26 by
popular vote, but two opposition groups have collected more than
100,000 opposing signatures, enough to force a plebiscite on the
issue.
   The groups _ the League of Free Democrats and the League of
Young Democrats _ say the early date favors Socialist Party
candidate Imre Pozsgay because it doesn't give the opposition
enough time to organize and make their candidates well known.
   In addition, legislators planned Tuesday to discuss and vote on
government proposals on a suspended Danube River hydroelectric
project with Czechoslovakia, a Warsaw Pact ally increasingly at
odds with Hungary over its reforms.
   In declaring a moratorium in May on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam
project, Hungary expressed concern about potential enviromental
damage. Czechoslovakia has said it will continue construction and
will demand compensation if work is permanently suspended by the
Hungarians.

   Two Bolshoi Ballet stars who had a hankering for a
handgun got a Navajo peace pipe instead, according to a gun shop
owner who said he opened his store after-hours to accommodate the
Soviet sharpshooters.
   Dancer Vladimir Vasiliev beamed and thanked shop owner Scottie
Jewell after he presented him with the pipe during an hour-long
shopping trip.
   ``Beautiful,'' Vasiliev said.
   Vasiliev headlines a touring company of the Bolshoi Ballet that
performed in Denver over the weekend. The troupe's Denver
appearance was sponsored by the Colorado Ballet, and the Soviets
practiced last week at the local company's rehearsal hall near
Jewell's store.
   Several of the dancers are avid hunters and Jewell and his
13-year-old daughter, Alexandra, are big ballet fans. Alexandra
also dances with the Colorado Ballet.
   One of the dancers wandered into the gun store last week, then
met Jewell again after Saturday night's Bolshoi performance and
asked if he could bring friends to the store. Jewell agreed to open
the shop on his day off for Vasiliev and dancer Alexandr Bogatyriev.
   The Soviets were unable to by a gun because Jewell can only sell
rifles and guns to U.S. citizens who are Colorado residents.
   Jewell said an Indian artist from Farmington, N.M., made the
peace pipe and had given it to him to sell. When the Soviets came,
however, ``I thought it would be even better to give it away.''

<HEAD>Bush Sending Three Cabinet Members to Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday he will send three
Cabinet members and his chief economic adviser to Poland to help
its non-communist government develop a strategy for overhauling the
country's battered economy.
   ``Poland's struggle has always been America's struggle,'' Bush
said. ``Maybe that's why it seems that Polish hearts and American
hearts beat as one.''
   The delegation named by Bush will include government, business,
labor and academic officials. It will be led by Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher,
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Michael Boskin, chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers.
   They will depart Washington on Nov. 29 and return on Dec. 2.
   Bush announced their selection in a Rose Garden ceremony marking
the end of October as Polish American heritage month.
   Saluting Poland for forming a non-communist government, the
first in Eastern Europe in more than 40 years, Bush said, ``Poland
herself has moved toward a new beginning.''
   Bush said that in Poland and elsewhere, ``the tide toward
oppression is running out. The tide toward liberty is running in.
   ``The voice of freedom is the voice of Poland, and the voice of
Poland is the voice of tomorrow.''
   Bush has proposed a $400 million, multiyear aid program for
Poland, but congressional Democrats are pushing for a package of
more than $1 billion.
   Discussing the mission with reporters following the president's
announcement, Mosbacher said that the travel group would be working
to speed up the process of getting assistance to Poland.
   ``They obviously have some serious fiscal and financial
problems. We just want to get as much in place as quickly as
possible,'' Mosbacher said, noting that winter is approaching.
   Among those accompanying the Cabinet officials will be AFL-CIO
President Lane Kirkland and various chief operating officers from
American companies, Mosbacher said. The business executives would
be exploring the possibility of starting joint ventures in Poland,
he said.
   ``We need a combination of people who have the expertise, people
who have the equipment, people who have the money and the
know-how,'' said Mosbacher.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Boycott of Moslem Autonomy Referendum a Mistake</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto MLA4</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino on
Monday urged people to vote in next month's plebiscite for
self-rule in the southern Philippines, saying a boycott would be a
mistake.
   It was the second time in three days that Mrs. Aquino has gone
to Mindanao, the second largest Philippine island, to campaign for
the ratification of a plan to grant limited self-rule in 13
southern provinces.
   On Saturday, Mrs. Aquino visited Cotabato to start the campaign,
but made no categorical appeal for voters to ratify the autonomy
act, which was passed by Congress.
   Voters in Mindanao and other southern islands go to the polls
Nov. 19 to decide whether their provinces will join an autonomous
regional government.
   The move is aimed at satisfying demands for self-rule for the 4
million-member Moslem minority. Christians form the majority in the
provinces of Mindanao and other southern islands.
   The bill, which Mrs. Aquino signed in August, has been facing
public opposition even from Moslem secessionist groups.
   ``I understand that some groups are organizing a boycott of the
plebiscite, Mrs. Aquino told hundreds of people at a rally. ``I
think this would be a serious mistake. A boycott position is
meaningless.''
   She refused to say whether she was for ratification or rejection
of the bill, adding that she was adopting a position of ``active
neutrality.''
   ``I have refused to dictate how people should vote for the
plebiscite,'' she said.
   She said she had been accused by her foes as being indecisive,
but she defended her stand, saying she upheld the principle of
``popular consultation.''

<TEXT>
   A state board is caught in a political
ruckus over its decision to clear an optometrist who had some women
patients strip to the waist during eye exams.
   The Iowa Board of Optometry Examiners once voted to exonerate
optometrist Gary Fisher of Monticello but is reconsidering that
decision in the face of intense public pressure.
   The case has angered some women, pitted health professionals
against each other and raised questions about closed meetings of
medical regulators.
   The seven-member board scheduled a telephone conference call
Tuesday morning to decide if it wants to review Fisher's case. The
board met privately for more than five hours Saturday.
   Fisher was hauled before the state licensing board on ethics
charges after some women patients complained that he had them
partially disrobe.
   Fisher argued he did so for legitimate reasons, to check for
curvature of the spine associated with some eye disorders. Because
much of the professional discipline review is private, the issue
first came to light last month when the board cleared him.
   In its ruling, the panel said Fisher was ``honestly attempting
to provide the best care.''
   That decision prompted an uproar from lawmakers and others.
   ``It was kind of like a foot doctor looking at the brain,'' said
state Sen. Jack Nystrom, ranking member of the State Government
Committee.
   The issue heated up when the attorney general's office joined
with the board that regulates physicians in urging a new hearing.
The medical board threatened a lawsuit, saying Fisher strayed into
the practice of medicine, for which he isn't licensed.
   Fisher complained about being hounded by reporters; then he and
everyone else involved in the matter stopped commenting on the
advice of lawyers, who expect the issue eventually will land in
court.
   Fisher did say he no longer performs topless eye exams.

<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar on Monday urged the United States, Britain and Singapore to
rejoin the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
   The United States left UNESCO in 1984, followed by Britain and
Singapore, on the grounds that the Paris-based U.N. agency was
politicized, anti-Western, mismanaged and too expensive.
   ``Science, education, culture, and communications are not
confined by national boundaries,'' the U.N. chief said.
``International organizations which deal with questions of global
concern such as these should be truly universal.''
   UNESCO is holding its General Conference meeting in Paris,
considering a reform program by its director-general, Federico
Mayor Zaragoza, and a more Third-World oriented agenda proposed by
the agency's Executive Board.
   One of the key factors that drove the United States out of
UNESCO was its consideration of a ``New World Information Order.''
   Third World nations saw the adoption of the policy as a way of
reducing the dominance of news agencies from the developed world in
international communications.
   The United States and Britain, however, feared Third World
nations would use the mandate to license journalists, enforce an
ethics code among them, and urge reporters to adopt ideological
goals, such as opposing racism and war.
   U.S. and British publishers and communications companies were
outraged at the suggestions, and supported President Ronald
Reagan's and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decision to quit
the agency.
   Mayor has criticized plans for censorship or government control
of journalism and says the free flow of information should not
restricted.

<TEXT>
   A 475-foot ship hauling fertilizer phosphate ran
aground Monday in the westernmost Florida Keys, but the Coast Guard
said it appeared no cargo or fuel had spilled.
   The grounding was the second in five days by a ship sailing
along the 200-mile chain of islands at the southernmost tip of
Florida.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, who flew over to inspect the
Yugoslavian-registered Mavro Vetranic, said the ship apparently
``was well embedded on a coral reef.''
   ``It appears it has hit a crown jewel,'' he said. ``The reefs of
Florida are crown jewels in the underwater environment.''
   The ship was carrying 14,300 tons of phosphate for use in
fertilizer, 120,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil and 23,000 gallons of
diesel fuel, the Coast Guard said.
   ``There is no visible pollution, there's no injuries at the
moment, and the ship is hard aground,'' Petty Officer Alastair
Worden said after a Coast Guard helicopter flew over the
16-year-old ship.
   An owner's representative was arranging for tugs, barges to
lighten the ship's load and a salvage surveyor to determine what
can be done to move the ship, stranded about 7{ miles northeast of
Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas.
   The island cluster 70 miles west of Key West is the site of Fort
Jefferson National Monument and is marked by a tall lighthouse as
well as the massive fort.
   The governor earlier proposed a 10-mile buffer zone for shipping
off Florida to reduce the danger of groundings and spills, but
international agreement would be required for any such change. No
formal shipping lanes exist off the Florida Keys.
   ``We've had two of these (groundings) in less than a week,''
Martinez said. ``This will clearly show that we were not crying
wolf when we first brought this up.''
   The cargo ship ran aground at 1:45 a.m., but the Coast Guard
wasn't informed until it received a message from another vessel at
7:50 a.m., said Petty Officer James Wentworth.
   A Coast Guard marine inspector, a representative of Lloyd's of
London, the ship's insurer, and federal and state divers were among
those sent to inspect the grounded ship.
   The ship, built in 1973, is owned by Atlanska Plovidba of
Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, a port on the Adriatic Sea.
   The grounding came five days after a much smaller cargo ship,
the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland, tore a 200-yard swath through
coral in Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, about 50 miles
southeast of Miami.
   A Coast Guard inquiry into that grounding resumed Monday in
Miami with one crew member saying the ship's owner had a
non-alcoholic policy but beer was in the ship's refrigerator.
   The first mate, who was at the helm, failed two breath tests
after the grounding, but both he and the captain said he didn't
start drinking until after the accident.
   The unlicensed first mate, Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, has been
charged with negligence, and the ship's captain Duane Godwin, 37,
with allowing an improperly licensed sailor to operate the ship.
   Ship repairs should be completed by Wednesday, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Luis Diaz.

   The two hotels will be built on a 325-acre wooded setting

<TEXT>
   States have had only modest success in
classroom reforms, although there was a greater effort at improving
public education in the 1980s than ever before, a consortium of
universities said Monday.
   ``State legislators introduced an unsurpassed number of
education-related bills, increased state aid, and examined the
findings of hundreds of state-level task forces and commission,''
said the Center for Policy Research in Education.
   Local initiatives had the most progress on restructuring
schools, said the report, ``The Progress of Reform: An Appraisal of
State Education Initiatives.''
   The report was based on research conducted in Arizona,
California, Florida, Georgia, Minnesota and Pennsylvania and used
as its benchmark goals set forth in ``A Nation At Risk,'' the 1983
landmark government report that prompted efforts to improve
learning in America.
   ``It is true that high school curricula are more academically
oriented, standards for entering the teaching profession are more
selective, teachers' salaries are higher and state and local
governments have boosted educational funding,'' said the report.
   ``But the reforms met with only modest success in achieving
their goals,'' the report continued. ``Doubts still linger about
the rigor and challenge of some of the new courses in academic
subjects, the impact of reform on at-risk students, the quality of
teachers and teaching and the equitable funding of schools.''
   The report said states tended to reject complicated reform
recommendations in favor of more manageable ones. The most popular
reform of the last five years was increasing graduation
requirements, a relatively uncomplicated procedure, the report said.
   At least 45 states have modified high school graduation
requirements since 1980, primarily by increasing the number of
credits and academic courses needed to earn a diploma, it said.
   The easy reforms that were adopted have stayed in place, the
report said. But more complicated reforms such as teacher
assessments, career ladders and mentor teacher programs have been
modified or diluted, it found.
   Reforms adopted by most states lacked coherence, ``sending a
barrage of signals to schools and districts without setting clear
priorities,'' the study said.
   The report said most of the progress resulted from initiatives
at the local school district level. During the 1980s, several
states encouraged school restructuring by providing seed money for
local experiments, but some districts were developing changes
without state support, it said.
   The federally funded Center for Policy Research in Education is
a consortium of Rutgers, Michigan State and Stanford universities
and the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

   Air pollution reached dangerous levels in
the capital Monday because of warm, calm conditions, and the
government announced emergency measures for cars and industry.
   The Environment Ministry banned all cars with license plates
ending in even numbers from most of Athens from 7 a.m. Tuesday to
10 a.m. Wednesday.
   Industries in and around Athens also were ordered to limit fuel
consumption by 30 percent during the emergency.
   The independent PAKOE environment agency said 273 people
received treatment for heart and respiratory problems heightened by
the pollution.
   The weather bureau said warm, calm weather would continue on
Tuesday, threatening to raise pollution levels even higher.
   Over the years air pollution has become a serious problem,
reaching emergency levels whenever warm, windless weather traps the
thick brown smog within the mountains that circle the coastal plain
where more than one-third of Greece's 10 million people live.
   In September 1982 the government banned half of the capital's
800,000 private cars from the central Athens area during office
hours. Vehicles are allowed into the restricted zone on alternate
days, depending on their license plate numbers.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Detroit Papers' Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A critic of the proposed partial merger of
Detroit's two daily newspapers told the Supreme Court Monday that
permitting the move would be ``a terrific incentive for monopoly''
conduct.
   But a lawyer for the Bush administration, defending former
Attorney General Edwin Meese's approval of the joint operating
agreement, said such mergers are needed to protect the dwindling
number of two-newspaper cities in America.
   Elsewhere, an investor group offered to buy the Detroit Free
Press for $68 million from Knight-Ridder Inc., which has said it
will sell or shut down the paper if the joint operating agreement
with the Gannett-owned Detroit News is overturned.
   The high court heard 60 minutes of arguments over the partial
merger and is expected to announce a decision by July. Justice
Byron R. White has removed himself from consideration of the case,
creating the possibility of a 4-4 tie that would uphold the joint
operating agreement.
   William B. Schultz, representing a group of Michigan readers and
advertisers who oppose the joint agreement, said both newspapers
are ``competitive equals'' and could survive if they raised
newstand prices and advertising rates.
   But, he said, the papers have been engaged in a price-cutting
war for years designed to drive each other out of business or force
a partial merger highly profitable to both.
   ``Their prices are too low and their advertisement rates are the
lowest in the country,'' he said.
   If the Supreme Court permits the Detroit papers to operate
jointly, ``It will result in artificial generation'' of other such
arrangements, Schultz said. ``The profit possibilities are
enormous.''
   But Thomas W. Merrill of the Justice Department said the partial
mergers are aimed at ``preserving two or more editorial voices'' in
cities that otherwise might become one-newspaper towns. There are
competing newspapers now in only 25 cities.
   Merrill said there are enough potential readers in Detroit to
support two newspapers if there were ``a pricing czar'' to prevent
price-cutting. ``Unfortunately there is no czar,'' he said.
   The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 authorizes the
attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an
exemption from federal antitrust laws.
   The Free Press and News have agreed to combine their business,
advertising and production departments but maintain separate news
and editorial staffs.
   They put off the partial merger pending the high court's ruling
on whether Meese improperly approved the deal in August 1988.
   The Free Press lost $10 million a year between 1981 and 1986.
The News lost $50 million in the same period.
   Gannett Co. is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group
and Knight-Ridder is second.
   Schultz stressed that the two companies essentially have agreed
to split profits down the middle if the joint agreement takes
effect. That suggests they regard the newspapers as competitive
equals and casts doubt on claims the Free Press is failing, he said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens aggressively questioned Merrill's
arguments that approving the joint operating agreement will not
sanction predatory pricing forbidden by antitrust law.
   Is this ``lawful or unlawful pricing?'' Stevens asked Merrill.
``I'd like an answer.''
   Merrill said, ``The record in this case does not suggest
predatory pricing.'' He said it would be unfair to overturn the
agreement and order further examination of that issue.
   The investor group that wants to buy the Free Press for $68
million is headed by William D. McMaster. He said he wanted to
convert the newspaper's format to a ``statewide community
newspaper''
   The case is Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press vs.
Thornburgh, 88-1640.

   A banner that misspelled the word
``excellence'' illustrated for the state's new education task force
the enormity of the job they began tackling Monday.
   Embarrassed organizers ripped down the banner that read
``Excellance In Secondary Education'' moments before Bobby
Etheridge, state superintendent of public instruction, opened the
meeting. The panel is attempting to rescue North Carolina's
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores from the bottom of the nation's
rankings.
   The banner was rolled up and the wall remained bare during the
speeches.
   ``It was just one of those glitches that you wish did not
happen,'' said W. Glenn Keever, spokesman for the state Department
of Public Instruction. ``We're not laughing it off.''
   ``We're sorry it happened but we can understand that it's
awfully difficult to see mistakes in words when the letters are
that large,'' he said of the sign, which had letters nearly a foot
high and was made by a sign company.

<HEAD>Amateur Astronomer Discovers Asteroids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An amateur astronomer using a homemade telescope
said Monday he has discovered three new asteroids, and the editor
of Astronomer magazine said he's the first Briton to make such a
find in 80 years.
   Brian Manning said he spotted the asteroids between the orbits
of Jupiter and Mars using a 10-inch reflector telescope set up in
his back yard in Kidderminster, 95 miles northwest of London.
   Editor Guy Hurst, who keeps track of all European astronomical
discoveries, said Manning's sightings were run through the
International Astronomical Union computer in Cambridge, Mass., and
found to be previously unknown.
   ``To go for 80 years with no discovery, it is very important for
British astronomy,'' Hurst said. ``Manning's work, although he is
an amateur, is rated as high as professional.''
   Manning, 63, said astronomy has been his hobby since he was a
boy.
   ``I'm delighted and did not expect it really,'' he said. ``You
always hope you might find something ... but it's a surprise since
the chance of discovery is rather remote.''
   Manning's discovery was his first attempt to identify an
asteroid, and was sparked by the September issue of Astronomer,
which challenged British amateurs to find an asteroid, Hurst said.
   Manning, a retired technician from Birmingham University's
Department of Metrology, which is the science of accurate
measurements, said he made a 20-minute photographic exposure of the
sky on Oct. 4.
   He didn't discover the asteroids until Oct. 5 when he developed
the telescopic image and scanned it with a binocular microscope.
   ``My garden is not a very good spot. It's down in a hollow with
trees all around,'' he said. ``The night of the fourth was quite
good, despite the millions of street lamps everywhere, which are a
big problem to amateur astronomers.''
   Although Manning discovered the asteroids they will be named by
the International Astronomical Union. The international society
voted last year to name asteroid 3,698, discovered by another
scientist, after Manning ``for his contribution to astronomy,''
Hurst said.
   Asteroids are thought to be the remnants of planets that were
partly formed or destroyed in the early days of the solar system.
   The first asteroid, named Ceres, was discovered in 1801. At 621
miles in diameter, it is still the largest ever found.
   Manning said he believes his asteroids are about 10 miles wide.

   A lawsuit filed Monday alleges that the
Environmental Protection Agency has failed to develop national
standards for discharging toxic pollution into public waterways as
required by law.
   As a result, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District
Court by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen,
millions of pounds of toxic wastes are unregulated.
   The lawsuit asks the federal courts to direct the EPA to develop
a plan for limiting a broader range of toxic pollution than is
covered by federal regulations.
   ``Over two-thirds of the industrial facilities that release
toxics into our waterways are not covered by nationwide EPA
regulations, but by a weak system of site-specific permits,'' said
Robert Adler, an attorney for the NRDC, a Washington-based
environmental organization.
   EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said the agency had no immediate
comment on the lawsuit because officials have not seen it.
   The suit, using data filed by industry to the EPA on 1987 toxic
emissions, said an estimated 70 million pounds of unregulated toxic
wastes are released annually into surface waters and sewers from a
variety of industries ranging from parmaceutical companies to
mining, iron and steel and texile operations.
   Eric Glitzenstein, an attorney for Public Citizen, said many of
those toxic releases come from companies that are in business to
treat hazardous wastes.
   ``The hazardous waste treatment industry is perhaps the most
astonishing example of an industry that escapes nationwide toxic
pollution controls,'' Giltzenstein said.
   ``Ironically, these facilities are cleaning up polluted land and
groundwater at hazardous waste sites, only to release equally
dangerous wastes into our waters.''
   The lawsuit alleges that the EPA has failed to live up to
requirements under the Clean Water Act and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act to establish in a timely fashion a
regulatory plan for controlling the discharge of hazardous waste
into public waterways.

<HEAD>Cuban Troops Reach Halfway Point in Withdrawal from Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half of Cuba's 50,000 soldiers in Angola
have left for home, slightly ahead of a schedule set in peace
agreements signed last year by Angola, Cuba and South Africa,
officials said Monday.
   In a ceremony at the capital's airport, the last 150 of the
first 25,000 Cubans to leave the southwest African nation paraded
past Angolan, Cuban and U.N. officials to board Soviet-built
transport planes.
   According to the accords signed Dec. 22, 1988, in New York,
3,000 Cubans were to have left Angola by April 1 and 25,000 by Nov.
1. All 50,000 are to be out by July 1, 1991.
   Brazilian Gen. Pericles Ferreria Gomes said he thought the
actual number of repatriated Cubans could be even higher than
25,000 due to differences in U.N. and Cuban counting methods.
   A U.N. monitoring force will leave Luanda on Wednesday to
inspect former Cuban bases below the 13th parallel that runs along
Angola's central highlands close to the Benguela railroad, Gomes
said.
   Gomes, as leader of the force, said he would also travel south
of the parallel Friday to check the bases.
   Following the New York accords, the pullout began in January
when the first 3,000 troops left Luanda.
   U.S. officials repeatedly have reported the Cuban withdrawal
proceeding on, or slightly ahead of, schedule. They verified the
Cubans pulled back to north of the 15th parallel Aug. 1.
   Cuba and Angola agreed to the pullout in exchange for South
Africa's pledge to cease aid to the rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola and allow Namibia to gain
independence.
   South African aid to UNITA, as the rebels are known, was
replaced by a boost in U.S. assistance to $40 million a year.
   UNITA has been fighting to force the Marxist Angolan government,
backed by Cuba, to share power since shortly after Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.

   Government-run broadcasting
said Tuesday that peaceful demonstrations such as the huge
anti-apartheid rally over the weekend have helped ease political
tensions and assisted reforms.
   ``We thank the people for behaving within the norms of
democratic society,'' Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler, the police public
relations chief said of the 70,000-member rally Sunday at a soccer
stadium on the edge of Johannesburg.
   It was the largest ever anti-government event, and virtually
every aspect violated security laws.
   But authorities approved the event in advance and police
maintained a low profile as African National Congress leaders,
released from prison Oct. 15, endorsed the organization's guerrilla
campaign and called for increased economic sanctions against the
white-run government.
   ``There is no doubt this event will go down in history as the
most dramatic, most poignant, and perhaps the most politically
significant since the start of the struggle for liberation,'' said
the Sowetan, the nation's largest black-oriented daily newspaper.
   The ANC has been outlawed since 1960, but Sunday's rally was the
clearest signal yet that the government is willing to allow
peaceful public activities by the organization.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said it would be better
to lift laws restricting political freedom than to enforce them
selectively.
   ``The best thing for (the government) to do, if it is not going
to apply the laws, is to do away with them,'' the editorial said.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told government-run TV
Sunday night that peaceful protest offers a needed outlet for those
with political grievances.
   ``I don't think we need to be afraid that these protests, which
are monitored, will break into violence,'' Vlok said.
   But Andries Treurnicht, head of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party, called for an urgent session of Parliament to debate the
government's relaxed stance toward protests.
   ``The ANC, under its own flag and that of the Communist Party
alongside, is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims and
ambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to the
government,'' Treurnicht said.
   ``The government's authority to maintain law and order and to
enforce the laws of the land is being blatantly challenged,'' he
added.
   Police spokesman Col. Vic Haynes said police were studying
Sunday's rally to determine whether anyone should be prosecuted.
   However, police have made similar statements after several
recent demonstrations and have not taken any action.
   When a magistrate approved Sunday's rally, he warned organizers
not to promote the aims of the ANC.
   ``We refused,'' said Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader and one of
the main organizers. ``The ANC lives. It is amongst us.''
   The seven ANC leaders freed unconditionally Oct. 15 appeared on
a podium beneath huge banners of the ANC and the South African
Communist Party. Six of the seven had spent at least 25 years in
prison.
   Deafening cheers erupted when the men, led by Walter Sisulu,
slowly circled the playing field behind an honor guard of 20 young
militants, clad in khaki uniforms and marching in military style.
   ``ANC! ANC!'' shouted the crowd, many dressed in the movement's
colors of green, black and gold.
   Sisulu said his movement would never abandon its guerrilla
campaign unilaterally but would consider suspending violence and
entering talks if the government freed all political prisoners,
legalized the ANC and lifted the state of emergency.
   De Klerk, who assumed power in August, has offered to negotiate
a new constitution within five years that would extend political
rights to blacks but protect white interests. The ANC wants a
constitution that would establish a one-person, one-vote system.

   Sharon Percy Rockefeller was named Monday as
president-chief executive officer of WETA-TV-FM, one of the
nation's flagship public television stations, the station announced.
   Mrs. Rockefeller, 44, will succeed Ward B. Chamberlin Jr., who
is stepping down Dec. 1 after 15 years as president of WETA, the
third-largest production center for the Public Broadcasting Service.
   Mrs. Rockefeller was the unanimous choice of an 11-member search
committee that she headed when it was established in March. She
resigned from the committee after she decided to toss her hat in
the ring.
   Chamberlin said the station found ``the best possible choice in
our own back yard.''
   Mrs. Rockefeller, a Democrat and cum laude graduate of Stanford
University, is a former chairwoman of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. She is married to Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV,
D-W.Va., and is the daughter of former Republican Sen. Charles
Percy of Illinois.
   She serves on the boards of Pepsico, PBS, Stanford University,
the University of Chicago and the National Women's Political Caucus.
   Her political connections are seen as making her a powerful
fund-raiser for WETA, which produces ``The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' in association with WNET, New York, and MacNeil-Lehrer
Productions, ``Washington Week in Review,'' ``In Performance at the
White House'' and ``Smithsonian World.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush broke ground Monday for a
memorial to slain police officers and said cop killers should pay
``the ultimate price'' for committing ``the ultimate crime.''
   Bush drew loud applause from a large crowd that included
hundreds of police officers, widows and other relatives of some of
the 30,000 officers whose names will eventually be carved on
granite walls at the memorial site.
   Bush prodded Congress to act quickly on the $1.2 billion
anti-crime package he unveiled last May, including stiffer
penalties for gun-related crimes, limits on semiautomatic weapons
and no plea bargaining with those who used guns in violent crimes.
   ``It is time to act because these improvements are a vital part
of our national drug strategy,'' said Bush, adding, ``Before any
more names are added to that wall, the protection you deserve
should be added to the books.''
   ``For cop killers, for those who commit the ultimate crime, I
feel strongly that they should pay the ultimate price,'' said the
president.
   The Senate is expected to vote later this year on Bush's crime
package. The House is awaiting Senate action before it takes up the
measure.
   Bush, who keeps in his desk the shield of a New York City rookie
policeman, Eddie Byrne, murdered last year while protecting a drug
witness, said the toll from police killings ``rivals those of
America's overseas wars.''
   Bush made the speech behind bullet-proof glass on a stage
erected at the Judiciary Square site where the National Law
Enforcement Officers Memorial will be erected.
   It will consist of an oval, tree-lined ``pathway of
remembrance'' on a three-acre site with the names of the slain
police officers on a three-foot-high wall. Last year alone, 161
federal, state and local officers were killed in the line of duty.
   Bush said it will be a tribute to ``the thin blue line that
protects our nation from the evil within.''
   He singled out several slain officers, from the first, Robert
Marshall, a U.S. marshal killed in 1794 serving ``routine court
papers'' in Augusta, Ga., to Chicago Police Officer Irma Ruiz,
killed in September 1988 by ``a drug-crazed gunman'' who invaded
the school where she stood guard, to Philadelphia Officer Albert
Valentino, shot down last week while investigating a burglary.
   Ruiz' partner, Gregory Jaglowski, despite his own wounds,
managed to kill Ruiz' slayer, who had taken three other lives that
day.
   Jaglowski joined Bush, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and
Craig Floyd, chairman of the memorial, in turning over four shovels
of dirt for the actual groundbreaking.
   The $5 million memorial, authorized by a 1984 law unanimously
passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan, is being built
with private contributions. So far, the non-profit group
spearheading the drive has raised $4 million, including
contributions from 400,000 individuals.
   In front row seats at the ceremony were Jim Brady, the former
White House press secretary wounded in the 1981 attack on Reagan,
and his wife, Sarah, now a crusader for gun control.
   Among the VIPs on stage were former Attorney Gen. Edwin Meese
III, whom Bush said had ``stood strong and tall for law
enforcement.''

   The toll from two earthquakes in Algeria
reached at least 30 dead and 250 injured Monday, civil defense
officials reported, and rescue teams continued searching for
victims.
   The temblors struck 12 minutes apart Sunday evening, the first
registering 6 on the Richter scale and the second 4.8. Heaviest
damage was reported in Tipasa, 40 miles west of Algiers, and at
Churchell, a Mediterranean coastal town 60 miles west of the
capital.
   Prime Minister Maloud Hamrouche and his ministers of health and
interior toured those areas.
   Residents of Nador, Sidi Moussa and Sidi Amar blocked roads to
demand government aid. One demonstrator shouted: ``Be human! We are
simply asking for help!''
   Police used tear gas Monday afternoon to clear people off
National Highway 11. One person was arrested.
   Protesters carried signs demanding tents, water and bread. Local
officials said relief materials were being brought in as quickly as
possible, but there was a severe shortage of ambulances, generators
and other rescue equipment.
   In the village of Nora below Chenoua Mountain, their collapsing
house killed five children of the Berkouk family _ Samia, 1;
Darifa, 3; Brahim, 4; Naima, 7, and Fatima, 8.
   All but one of Nora's houses were built of traditional mud
bricks made of clay mixed with straw. The one exception was the
only house not reduced to rubble.
   ``Many times we asked for construction material to build
stronger houses,'' one resident said. ``Our appeals were ignored.''
   Eighteen hours after the first temblor at 8:15 p.m. Sunday,
relief supplies still had not reached some areas. Many people spent
Sunday night outside, in gardens, public squares or schoolyards.
   Some resident of Algiers panicked. Samia Daoudi, 17, jumped from
the balcony of her fourth-floor apartment and was taken to a
hospital with a broken hip.
   Marie Josephe, a Frenchwoman hospitalized in Tipasa with a
fractured shoulder, said: ``In a few seconds the house collapsed,
and I found myself in the hospital,''
   Four deaths in Algiers were attributed to the quakes and some
buildings were damaged.
   An earthquake that hit Al Asnam, 100 miles west of Algiers, in
1980 killed an estimated 2,500 people.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph, and each increase of one number means 10 times greater
strength. A quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas.
   A 1988 earthquake in the same region affected Sunday measured
5.4 and injured 60 people.

   There was no parade for baseball's world
champions on Monday, just a muted rally in which the Oakland
Athletics' triumph mingled with memories of this city's recent
tragedy.
   More than 4,000 fans of the A's, who completed a four-game sweep
of the San Francisco Giants on Saturday, joined in the rally in
Jack London Square. It began with music and a flag procession. A
moment of silence planned for victims of the recent earthquake was
forgotten in the excitement.
   ``The longer you have to wait for something, the more it means
to you,'' said A's Manager Tony La Russa. ``Nobody likes the reason
we had to wait so long to be the world champions, but I know it
means a great deal to all of us.''
   Each of the players, standing in front of a banner that read,
``Oakland's World Serious,'' spoke briefly to the crowd.
   A few minutes earlier, workers clearing battered vehicles from a
crumpled section of Interstate 880 removed the car in which the
last survivor of the freeway's collapse, longshoreman Buck Helm,
was trapped for four days.
   Helm remained in serious condition but continued to show slow
improvement, said a spokeswoman for Highland Hospital. Thirty-nine
people died in the freeway collapse.
   There had been plans for a more traditional parade and ceremony
at City Hall if the A's won the World Series. But those plans were
canceled after the 7.1 magnitude quake struck Oct. 17, a half-hour
before the originally scheduled third game at Candlestick Park.
   The game was postponed until 10 days later, and the A's quickly
ended the Series by winning the third and fourth games at
Candlestick.
   Many of the buildings along the planned parade route remain
roped off, still too dangerous to enter, and the ornate City Hall
is so badly damaged it may never reopen.
   The rally, though small and tame compared with the parade after
the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl victory last January, signaled
another step toward recovery by the Bay area.
   ``People now are trying to find hope,'' said the Rev. Cecil
Williams before his sermon Sunday at Glide Memorial Church in San
Francisco. ``Some people don't want to face the trauma, they don't
want to face the pain. I'm hoping this will be a learning
experience. This is a tremendous opportunity for the city to be
what's never been before, a new Jerusalem, a city that is more
loving and equal and kind.''
   Bay area companies, hoping to bring back nervous tourists and
conventioneers, are mounting an advertising campaign to show the
world that San Francisco and Oakland still stand.
   ``We've had our natural disaster, we don't want an economic
disaster,'' said Shelby Allen, vice president for marketing for the
San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is kicking off
its pitch Thursday.
   Hyatt, which owns 10 hotels in the Bay area, is launching a
similar campaign in six newspapers across the country starting
Tuesday.
   ``We're doing a lot because the world thinks we've tumbled into
the bay. We're trying to project the image that the city is not in
rubble,'' said Charles McElroy, general manager of the
Hyatt-Regency in San Francisco.
   In Oakland, a coalition of business groups called Celebrate
Oakland hired three ad agencies to put together a campaign to show
that the city is returning to normal. The Port of Oakland also is
running ads headlined ``Oakland Can Take It'' in trade magazines.
``We've taken some licks, but we're on our way back,'' the ad says.
   Recovery efforts also are continuing strong with donations from
around the country.
   A big truck rig carrying disaster relief supplies donated by the
people of Evansville, Ind., was unloaded in Los Gatos for quake
victims in that city, the Santa Cruz Mountains and Watsonville.
   The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons,
holding its annual meeting in San Francisco, asked each of the
2,000 attending doctors to donate $100 to help quake victims.
   Traffic remains a major problem that may be getting worse, with
I-880 partly closed and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge still
closed for repair.
   State Department of Transportation officials said the heavy
traffic last week and over the weekend may be mild compared to what
is to come. Officials calculated that just 80 percent of regular
commuters went back to work last week.
   ``We expect them all to go back this week,'' said Steve Saville,
spokesman for Caltrans. ``The first couple of days will be a true
indication of what we're dealing with.''

   President Bush on Monday signed legislation
that gives a break to farmers who are growing substitute crops on
land where drought destroyed or damaged earlier plantings.
   The measure eases restrictions that were part of a previous
federal farm-disaster aid package.
   The revision protects winter wheat and cotton farmers who
otherwise might have been denied disaster payments for their lost
crops under an Agriculture Department plan _ even though the
producers expect to earn little or no profit on replacement crops
such as grain sorghum or soybeans.
   The Agriculture Department, trying to prevent farmers from
reaping double benefits, has been planning to deduct 75 percent of
the gross value of any replacement crop from the disaster payment a
farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop.
   Under the bill, approved by Congress last week, that system
would be modified.
   Farmers would have no payment deductions if the replacement
crops failed to produce more than 50 percent of the county average
yield for the second crop.
   But if the yield exceeded 50 percent of average yield, the
Agriculture Department's formula for deductions would kick in and
be applied only to the portion of the crop that exceeded the 50
percent mark.
   Under the Agriculture Department's initial plan, even farmers
who had replanted only a few acres would have to wait until
harvesting their second crop before obtaining disaster benefits for
damage to the first crop.
   That provision was canceled by the new legislation.

   Six American members of a medical missionary
team detained in Mozambique six days ago for illegally entering the
country have been released, the State Department said Monday.
   The Mozambique government had said the six were traveling with a
Briton linked to a group spying for anti-government rebels.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the group
sponsor, the Christian Emergency Relief Team, described its mission
as providing medical assistance to refugees from Mozambique in
Malawi.
   Ms. Tutwiler said she wasn't certain how the group arrived in
Mozambique. They were detained last week near the border with
Malawi.
   The State Department said the six Americans were in good
condition and were offered assistance during a meeting in Maputo
with U.S. Embassy officials.
   Officials for the Carlsbad, Calif.-based Christian Emergency
Relief Team said the Briton accompanying the Americans was a guide.
   Kris Courson, the group's director of medical services,
identified the six Americans as: Dr. Ken Daugherty of San Diego;
Dr. Fred Leist and his wife, Lucille, of Bremerton, Wash.; Dr. John
Cannon, a dentist from Davenport, Iowa; and paramedics Carol
Roberts of Syracuse, N.Y., and Steve Sherrill of Stroudsburg, Pa.
   The official Mozambique news agency AIM quoted the foreign
ministry as identifying the other two group members as South
African missionary George Bezuidenhout and British citizen Peter
Hammond, who lives in South Africa.
   The news agency said Hammond had been turned over to the British
High Commission. The South African Foreign Ministry said
Bezuidenhout was freed Monday.
   ``Hammond runs a far-right, quasi-religious outfit called
Frontline Fellowship, which is openly supportive of South
African-backed bandit organizations such as UNITA in Angola and the
MNR in Mozambique,'' AIM said.
   Ian Grey, an Australian missionary who served 17 months of a
10{-year prison sentence after confessing to entering Mozambique
illegally, said after his 1988 trial that right-wing American
preachers were flown into guerrilla-controlled parts of Mozambique,
via Malawi, after contacts with Hammond.
   Hammond's brother, Derek, said Sunday night on South Africa's
state-run television, that the detained group had ``strayed across
the border into Mozambique amongst the villages.''
   ``They weren't there on a mission of war or involved in any
spying capacity. They were there on a genuine missionary trip to
assist people,'' he said.
   Hammond said his brother founded the Frontline Fellowship but
denied it was a right-wing front acting as a link to the guerrillas.
   The Christian Emergency Relief Team has sent missionary medical
teams to Lebanon, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, the Philippines and other
war-torn countries since 1974. The organization is led by David
Courson, an outspoken foe of communism.

<HEAD>Five Inmates Unaccounted For After Riots at State Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State police searched the charred rubble
and remaining buildings at the Camp Hill state prison Monday
looking for five inmates missing after a two-night rampage last
week.
   Hundreds of state prisoners will be shifted to federal prison to
make room for inmates from Camp Hill, where the riots left nearly
half the prison gutted or damaged by fire and 133 people injured,
officials said Monday.
   Corrections Department spokesman Kenneth Robinson said heavy
equipment was being used to move debris from the prison while state
police and security personnel conducted building-by-building sweeps
for the missing imates.
   ``We're not going to rule out anything, but we feel it's very
unlikely anyone escaped,'' said Sherri Cadeaux, a department
spokeswoman.
   ``It could be a paperwork thing. It could be that they're hiding
in the utility tunnels. At this point we don't have any reason to
believe that we're going to find bodies. We just don't know,'' she
added.
   Officials said there were no known breaches of the prison's
double ring of fences, which have been under heavy security since
violence erupted Wednesday. At the Capitol, Gov. Robert P. Casey
named a three-member commission to review the prison siege and the
effectiveness of the state's response.
   ``I am determined to get to the bottom of what happened at Camp
Hill,'' the governor said.
   Last Wednesday, 47 people were injured and eight hostages taken
during a seven-hour rampage that erupted after an inmate assaulted
a prison worker. A second night of rioting began Thursday evening.
Five hostages were released Friday morning after state police
stormed the prison.
   At that time, officials said there were no reported deaths and
no missing inmates. Six inmates and four prison staffers remained
hospitalized Monday.
   At the prison, about 1,340 inmates were being kept in cells
while hundreds of others were being held outdoors on the prison
grounds.
   By Saturday, 744 inmates had been transferred to other state
prisons because of the shortage of cells, Robinson said Monday. At
the time of the riots, the prison had a population of about 2,600,
about 45 percent over capacity.
   The governor met Monday with U.S. Sens. Arlen Specter and John
Heinz, both R-Pa., who said federal prisons had agreed to take 700
state inmates on a temporary basis to help ease crowding.
   Authorities will also be investigating a disturbance at a
Philadelphia prison, where inmates seized control of a cellblock at
Holmesburg Prison for about four hours Saturday night.
   Guards recaptured the city prison's ``I'' Block, fighting with
nightsticks as the prisoners fought back with homemade weapons.
During the Holmesburg riot, inmates could be heard shouting ``Camp
Hill, Camp Hill.''
   After the riot was put down, nine inmates, three with head
wounds, were admitted to hospitals. Three guards received severe
injuries, including multiple broken bones and deep cuts, but none
was admitted.
   On Oct. 23, 29 prison staffers and 19 inmates were injured
during a three-hour uprising at the state prison at Huntingdon, Pa.

   Most of the nation's hospitals have pulled the plug on offers to
X-ray Halloween goodies, saying the once popular way to detect pins
and needles is too costly and is ineffective in preventing
poisoning.
   ``It cost a fortune,'' said Rose Ann Soloway, of the National
Capital Poison Center at Georgetown University Hospital in
Washington, D.C.
   ``Someone calculated the cost in health care dollars, and it's
an enormous amount of money nationwide,'' Ms. Soloway said. ``It's
money that's probably not well spent.
   ``If candy is going to be tampered with, there's any number of
ways of doing it,'' she said. ``X-rays can only detect foreign
objects, especially metallic objects. X-rays can't detect chemicals
or anything that could be put on or into foods.''
   Donna Siegfried, technical safety specialist for the National
Safety Council in Chicago, said hospitals began using X-ray
machines to examine Halloween treats in the mid-1970s, when reports
of glass and pins lodged in goods became more frequent.
   But some officials said hospitals are just providing parents
with a false sense of security.
   ``We were concerned that parents who brought candy in to the
emergency room to have it X-rayed and were told that there was
nothing in it were led to believe it was safe,'' said Janet
Ferguson, Cabell Huntington Hospital spokeswoman in Huntington,
W.Va.
   Not all hospitals are taking the advice of the nation's poison
centers. Bob Blackburn, chief technician for Logan General Hospital
in Logan, W.Va., said the hospital has X-rayed candy for the past
several years and will do so again this year.
   ``There is no way to detect poisons, but we try to detect a
metallic foreign body. At least we're giving the child a chance,''
Blackburn said.
   ``In the past, we have found different things, pins stuck into
fruit and candy,'' he said. ``We caution the people when we do the
candy for the kids. We caution them that we can't detect any
poison.''
   Cabell Huntington Hospital examined youngsters' treats until two
years ago, when the American Association of Poison Control Centers
suggested hospitals no longer X-ray candy.
   John Baldwin, head nurse of Cabell Huntington's emergency
department, said experts can detect foreign bodies by X-rays only
14 percent of the time, ``which means most of the time they
couldn't detect it even if it were there.''
   Ms. Soloway said it's important that parents inspect each piece
of candy themselves rather than depending on X-rays at hospitals.
   While the X-raying process often disrupted hospital routines, it
was offered with good intentions and an eye on public relations,
said West Virginia Poison Control Center spokeswoman Pam Harvit.
But by last year, concerns about liability outstripped the
benefits, she said.
   ``The problem we saw is that parents would take the candy to get
it X-rayed and then give the kids the candy and assume it was
safe,'' she said.
   While parents still have concerns about tampered candy, the
National Safety Council's Siegfried said the number of reported
incidents is low.
   ``It's not a big problem. Rumors start and the media gets hold
of it, and it's usually just some individual that wanted
attention,'' she said.
   ``Falls are the number one cause of injury because of masks,
running up and down stairs ... tripping over their costumes,'' she
said.

<HEAD>House Approves $231 Million For FCC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday authorized $231.3 million
for the Federal Communications Commission over the next two years,
while ordering the agency to adopt a global perspective in
regulating the telecommunications industry.
   On a voice vote, the chamber gave the FCC $109.8 million in
spending authority for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, and $121.5
million for fiscal 1991. That was an increase from $99.6 million in
1989.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee
earlier this month authorized $109.8 million for the FCC in 1990,
but only $119.8 million for 1991.
   The House on Friday approved a fiscal 1990 appropriations
measure containing the $109.8 million, which is the amount the
White House had sought. The Senate was expected to act on a
companion appropriation Tuesday.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said the FCC needed the extra
money to cover costs of moving and consolidating agency offices in
1991 and to hire more people and facilities.
   Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, R-Calif., said ``It is money the agency
sorely needs.''
   The House on Monday also authorized $29.3 million for the
Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration for 1990 and 1991.
   The FCC authorization was amended last week by the House Energy
and Commerce Committee to require the agency to consider what
impacts its rulings may have on U.S. trade.
   The amendment by Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., was spurred by a
European Common Market decision last month to urge its 12 member
nations to broadcast television programs made in the market at
least 51 percent of the time, ``where practicable.''
   Richardson said that without giving the FCC increased authority
in matters of international trade, the amendment was a ``strong
signal'' that until foreign telecommunications markets are
completely open to U.S. companies, the United States will be
watching its own interests carefully.
   Markey said the measure gives the FCC no new authority in trade
matters, but it will tell ``the agency and the rest of the world
that we're serious about this international telecommunications
competition.''

<TEXT>
   Police using tear gas and
clubs dispersed 1,000 ethnic Albanians Monday who were protesting
the trial of the former Communist Party chief of Kosovo, a southern
province wracked by ethnic violence.
   Azem Vlasi, the ex-party leader, and 14 other ethnic Albanians
are accused of ``counterrevolutionary activities'' and opposing
constitutional changes that limited the province's autonomy.
   Death is the maximum penalty on conviction of the charges, which
include inciting ethnic Albanians to riot and strike. Vlasi's
co-defendants are officials and workers at a zinc and lead mine
where a strike occurred in March.
   Kosovo, with a predominantly ethnic Albanian population, is a
province in the republic of Serbia. For generations the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians have accused each other of discrimination.
   The trial was adjourned soon after it opened Monday as defense
lawyers asked for a change of venue. The lawyers said a fair trial
is impossible in Serbia because none of its courts could be
considered impartial.
   Police fired tear gas from armored vehicles and wielded
truncheons to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators in Podujevo, 20
miles from Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo. There also
were anti-Serb protests in Pristina.
   Before the confrontation in Podujevo, demonstrators marched
through the town chanting ``We Want Freedom'' and ``Azem! Azem!''
and trying to break through police lines. Azem is former party
leader Vlasi's first name.
   Many demonstrators were students and some wore scarves over
their faces to hide their identities.
   Small groups of protesters continued to roam the streets
following the main clash with police, hurling stones, breaking shop
windows and driving away Yugoslav and foreign journalists. Some
used cars and trash cans to erect street barricades.
   There were no reports of injuries but police were seen taking
away several people.
   In Pristina, police battled groups of protesters throughout the
city, including hundreds of students gathered around their school
dormitories. Police used tear gas in the pedestrian zone in the
downtown area, driving people screaming in panic down side streets.
   At the start of Monday's session in the Titova Mitrovica
courthouse, defense lawyers demanded that presiding Judge Ismet
Emra and prosecutor Spasone Zamfirovic be removed on grounds of
bias.
   Vlasi, 42, described the proceedings as a ``show trial staged
with clear political goals'' and claimed he was the victim of a
plot by archrival Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia.
   Until his arrest in March, Vlasi publicly opposed Milosevic's
efforts to increase control over Kosovo, an autonomous province in
which 85 percent of the 1.9 million people are ethnic Albanians. At
least 24 people were killed in the March violence.
   Milosevic and the Serbian leadership argued the changes were
necessary because of alleged harassment of the Serbian minority in
Kosovo, the heartland of ancient Serbia.
   Some analysts call the Vlasi case Yugoslaviaq's most important
political trial since that of Milovan Djilas in the 1950s. Djilas,
once heir apparent to the late President Tito, spent nine years in
jail for publicly criticizing the communist system and Tito's rule.
   Vlasi declared to the court Monday: ``The campaign to liquidate
me has lasted a long time ... and was conducted by Milosevic and
Rahman Morina,'' the current Kosovo party chief.
   Police cordoned off the courthouse and only 80 people, most of
them journalists or relatives of the accused, were allowed inside.
Several Western diplomats acting as human rights monitors were
among those denied access.
   The trial has been denounced in the liberal Yugoslav republics
of Slovenia and in Croatia as a Serbian bid to intimidate ethnic
Albanian dissent in Kosovo.
   Slovenian and Croatian members of the national collective
presidency and the Communist Party's ruling Presidium have urged
both bodies to demand the charges be dropped.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
Monday he doesn't want the power over airline takeovers that a bill
pending in Congress would give him.
   ``This is a piece of expansive legislation that no person like
myself who favors deregulation could support,'' Skinner said in an
interview.
   The House has scheduled to take up Tuesday the Air Carrier
Securities Act, which would require the Transportation Department
to block purchase of 15 percent or more of an airline if the sale
threatened to hinder safety, reduce competition, break up the
carrier or put it under foreign control.
   On a related matter, Skinner said he and financial experts had
serious reservations about the proposed takeover of United
Airlines' parent company, UAL Corp., before the deal fell through.
But he denied any role in collapse of the buyout plan, which Wall
Street analysts say triggered the Oct. 13 drop in the stock market.
   ``The United Airlines transaction fell for one reason and one
reason only _ it was not sound financially,'' Skinner said.
   Collapse of the UAL takeover bid by its unions and management,
with backing from several banks and British Airways, followed
announcement of an agreement Skinner reached with Alfred Checchi to
scale down foreign participation in Checchi's takeover of Northwest
Airlines' parent company, NWA Inc. The department concluded that
the original deal put KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in a position to
control Northwest.
   Skinner said his decision to modify the NWA takeover was
``thoroughly coordinated with senior officials of the White House.''
   Responding to reports that he had been criticized for the NWA
action by others in the administration, Skinner said, ``Anybody who
says that I did not keep the White House informed fully as to what
was going on prior to making those decisions just isn't informed.''
   Skinner declined, however, to describe any conversations he had
with other administration officials over his NWA action.
   The airline takeover bill pending in the House has had strong
bipartisan support, passing the Public Works and Transportation
Committee 23-5. A similar measure passed the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee but has not yet come up on the
Senate floor.
   The bills were prompted by a series of takeover moves in the
airline industry, including the United and Northwest deals and the
aborted attempt by developer Donald Trump to buy AMR Corp., parent
company of American Airlines. The decline in the stock market led
Trump to withdraw his $7.5 billion plan, which was opposed by AMR
management.
   Skinner and his deputy, Elaine Chao, both have sent letters to
Congress opposing the takeover bill, although Skinner had indicated
in earlier committee testimony that there may be advantages to
giving him power to approve takeovers rather than merely review
them after they are consummated.
   ``A preapproval process of existing law might be cleaner than
trying to unwrap a transaction; one can argue that,'' Skinner said
Monday, adding that when he made a similar statement before
Congress he may have been misinterpreted as supporting takeover
legislation.
   But he said the bills before Congress go too far.
   ``It goes far beyond the factors that under existing law I'm to
take into consideration,'' he said. Current law requires the
department to review airline aquisitions after they take place to
ensure that carriers are financially fit to operate safely and that
a foreign entity does not control them.
   Skinner said the proposed legislation would require him to
assess the impact of the deal on competition and to look at labor
provisions.
   ``That smacks of reregulation. It probably is reregulation and
is inappropriate in a deregulated environment,'' he said.
   ``The point is, I dont think I need it,'' Skinner said. ``I
think there are other ways I can do it.''

<HEAD>Charlotte Begins Citywide Cleanup of Hugo Debris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army of workers assembled Monday for
the first citywide cleanup since the remnants of Hurricane Hugo
struck this inland city more than a month ago.
   Officials said the crews were prepared to stay on the job seven
days a week for at least five weeks to clean up the tons of debris
left behind by Hugo.
   ``They'll work until we get out from under the emergency,'' said
Fred Rogers, operations supervisor for street maintainence for the
city of Charlotte.
   Employees will have to be released for vacations, he said. ``But
we're going to keep it running until it's all finished,'' Rogers
said. The only day off for employees in the next several weeks will
be Thanksgiving Day, he said.
   Hurricane Hugo hit the U.S. mainland on Sept. 22, dealing its
strongest blow to Charleston, S.C. By the time it reached
Charlotte, its winds had slowed from 135 mph to a steady 70 mph and
it had been downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm.
   Still, it was powerful enough to uproot thousands of trees,
knock down power lines and flood low-lying areas. Three people died
in the Charlotte area and preliminary estimates put the damage at
$300 million.
   A thorough, citywide cleanup was delayed while local officials
waited for federal damage estimates to be made, and for bids to
come in from various contractors who would do the cleanup.
   The workers who assembled to begin the job Monday came from 80
of the state's 100 counties and found a city still choked with
storm debris. Rogers said there was enough debris left to fill
about 160,000 dump trucks, each carrying 10 cubic yards of trash.
   ``It's going real well,'' he said. ``This morning it was kind of
chaotic. But we've got them all together now and from now on, it
should be a routine type thing and we should have no more trouble.''
   About 300 state workers in about 200 Transportation Department
trucks arrived Sunday. They'll help about 250 city workers and
employees of 16 private companies.
   Storm debris is still causing problems in Charleston as well.
Parents there have been urged not to send their youngsters
trick-or-treating on Halloween, for fear that debris on curbsides
might create a safety hazard.
   ``We don't think it's safe for children to go trick-or-treating
with all the debris on city streets. It's safer for parents to have
Halloween parties,'' police Sgt. Ronald Hamilton said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans marched for
democracy Monday night, the eve of a trip to Moscow by new leader
Egon Krenz for talks with the Soviet bloc's champion of reform,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Official media said about 300,000 people rallied in Leipzig, a
city of 650,000; at least 50,000 in Halle; 40,000 in Schwerin; more
than 20,000 in Karl Marx Stadt; and 5,000 in Poessneck.
   Lutheran Church sources in East Berlin said 3,000 pro-reform
activists demonstrated in the capital.
   Leipzig activists told The Associated Press by telephone many of
the marchers there demanded that the Communist Party give up its
monopoly on power.
   They said the protesters wanted free elections, freedom to
travel and legalization of opposition groups. Political parties now
are recognized only if they align themselves with the Communist
Party.
   The official news agency ADN said people in all the cities spoke
out for a free press, and those in Karl Marx Stadt carried banners
reading ``Democracy Now.''
   Krenz reaffirmed the Communist Party's pre-eminence Monday,
telling military academy graduates it was ``at the head of
qualitative changes going on in society.''
   ADN reported he would leave for the Soviet Union on Tuesday.
Krenz has said East Germany can learn much from reforms promoted by
Gorbachev, the Soviet president.
   That is a major departure from the contention of his 77-year-old
predecessor, Erich Honecker, that no changes in East Germany's
orthodox regime were necessary. Krenz replaced Honecker, his
mentor, as Communist Party chief Oct. 18.
   Weeks of demonstrations for reform have accompanied the flight
to the West of tens of thousands of East Germans. The largest
protests in the nation's 40-year history have taken place in
Leipzig, another one last week involving 300,000 people.
   In his speech at the academy, Krenz said ``the most decisive
factor'' in East Germany was ``the unity and cohesiveness of the
party, without which the unity of our people cannot be achieved.''
   Opposition groups say the party's leading role must be open to
debate.
   Democratic Reform said it had joined others in demanding the
development of a ``democratic consensus.'' The organization said it
would become an active opposition political party by next May.
   Krenz appears more open to change than Honecker, but many
activists are skeptical, feeling party leaders will block any
reform that challenges their monopoly on power.
   He has set what he calls ``a new course'' for the country,
promising freer travel abroad and declaring amnesty for
demonstrators, people who have fled the country illegally and those
who were caught while trying to do so.
   A leader of the officially recognized Liberal Democratic Party
said the ``political structure no longer corresponds to the will of
the people'' or they ``wouldn't be taking to the streets and there
wouldn't be movements like Neues Forum (New Forum) and Demokratie
Jetzt (Democracy Now).''
   Manfred Bogisch suggested in a commentary in his party
newspaper, Der Morgen, that the Communist Party's leading role
should to be earned, not dictated.
   Bogisch said communism was not an issue, but the Communist Party
leadership's policies were ``now a matter of debate.''
   ``Those who were responsible for the stagnation will have to
take responsibility for it,'' he declared.
   The Liberal Democrats have been at the forefront of efforts to
create more political pluralism within the system.
   Under East Germany's constitution, all recognized political
parties are aligned with the Communist Party. The Liberal Democrats
have said parties should have more independence.
   Leaders of the nation's government-aligned trade union
federation met jon Monday to discuss a confidence vote called for
by its leader, Harry Tisch. He requested the vote on his leadership
after young members accused the union of serving only government
interests.
   No decision was announced Monday and the union meeting was
continued until Tuesday, ADN reported.
   A mass rally Sunday in East Berlin, organized by local Communist
Party officials to discuss reform, attracted 20,000 people.
   It became an emotional forum, with speakers demanding that party
leaders account for to account for a host of alleged mistakes and
misdeeds. The crowd often booed and jeered officials.

   Bush administration officials said Monday that
candidates for top medical jobs will not be rejected because of
their views on abortion or other political issues.
   Medical and scientific experts have been concerned recently that
an ideological ``litmus test'' centering on abortion and related
issues was prompting qualified candidates to withdraw from
consideration for top federal jobs, including the directorship of
the National Institutes of Health.
   In a speech Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan said he took these concerns to the White House last week.
The administration has agreed, he said, that people being
considered for jobs below the level of assistant secretary do not
have to pass an ideological test.
   ``It has been our policy that standards of scientific and
administrative excellence and leadership prevail in the selection
process'' for scientific jobs, including heads of NIH and the
Centers for Disease Control, he said.
   However, he said, it was ``necessary and proper'' for Bush to
use the litmus test to fill positions at the level of assistant
secretary and above to select people who share his views.
   Conservative right-to-life groups have pressed the Bush
administration to appoint to positions at HHS people who share the
president's opposition to abortion.
   Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee said it
was particularly important that the head of NIH back the
president's abortion stance because ``a director who is inclined to
do so can undermine (the administration's) policy'' on such things
as research using fetal tissue.
   ``If the White House doesn't look into this, I'm sure some
senators will at the appropriate time,'' he said, referring to
Senate confirmation hearings on a nominee for NIH director.
   Medical and scientific experts have been concerned over reports
that at least one candidate for the NIH post withdrew after he got
a call from White House officials asking his position on abortion
and fetal tissue research.
   William Danforth, chancellor of Washington University in St.
Louis, reportedly told the caller that if that was all they wanted
to know about him, he was not interested in the job.
   Danforth has declined to answer questions on the subject. In a
statement, he has said he is not interested in leaving Washington
University and ``any conjecture about my candidacy, possible
conversations with White House representatives and others ... are
simply irrelevant.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush will
continue exploring the political views of candidates for
policy-making jobs in the health field.
   ``We'll still certainly ask them for their position on abortion,
fetal tissue research, AIDS, the whole range of issues that they
would have to be directing federal policy on,'' he said. ``But for
those jobs that essentially technical, below the assistant
secretary level, the answer is no.''
   He said the surgeon general's job ``would be a policy-making
job. We certainly would want to know that they support the
president's position.''
   Bush's candidate for surgeon general, Antonia Novello, deputy
director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, was asked her views on abortion before being selected
by the president, officials have said.
   Earlier this month, when the reports about Danforth surfaced and
it became clear that Novello was in line to be nominated,
administration officials said the abortion question was being asked
of candidates for most jobs at HHS, though that was not necessarily
the deciding factor.
   Scientists and medical experts said they feared that the
volatile issue would further politicize top government medical jobs
like the NIH post, which remains unfilled.

   A walkout persisted for a sixth day at Vargashor
coal mine Monday and activists at eight other mines in the Soviet
Far North said they would initiate support strikes on Nov. 1, the
official Tass news agency said.
   Strikers at Vargashor put down their tools last Wednesday to
protest what they called government failure to make good on
promises of improved economic and social conditions that ended a
walkout in July.
   Other strike leaders said they would start holding two-hour
``pre-emptive'' strikes Wednesday to pressure the government into
granting promised benefits.
   About 18,000 miners work in the Vorkuta region, above the Arctic
Circle. Workers at the eight other mines also struck on Wednesday,
but returned to work 1{ days later.
   A regional court ruled Saturday that the strikes violated a law
passed by the national Supreme Soviet on Oct. 9, but no indication
emerged as to what penalties might be imposed.
   Tass said the Vorkuta city strike committee plans to appeal the
decision to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
   It also quoted V. Gobrusev, a spokesman for the regional strike
committee, as saying his committee ``supported the miners' demands
and the tactics of pressure by pre-emptive strikes offered by the
miners' strike committees.''
   However, Tass said, the committee did not approve of the full
strike at Vargashor and said extended walkouts should be avoided.

<HEAD>Pierce's Lawyer Complains Government Won't Pay Legal Fees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.'s
lawyer accused the Justice Department Monday of giving an
``off-the-wall'' reason for not paying Pierce's legal expenses from
a congressional investigation.
   A Justice Department spokesman said it was just an
interpretation of law.
   Pierce twice refused to answer questions when he appeared before
the House Employment and Housing Subcommittee, which has been
investigating allegations of political favoritism at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, which he headed during the Reagan
administration.
   He contended that because the hearings related to his tenure at
the department, HUD should pay his fees.
   The department forwarded Pierce's request to the Justice
Department for a ruling on whether the former secretary qualified
for reimbursement under the regulations.
   Two weeks later, the Justice Department replied that it had no
responsibility to represent Pierce and therefore would not rule on
whether he qualified for reimbursement. The department said it was
up to HUD whether to represent Pierce or pay his fees.
   ``It's a hot potato,'' said Pierce attorney Robert Plotkin.
``HUD hands off to Justice, Justice hands off back to HUD.''
   Plotkin said the Justice Department defied a plain reading of
government regulations when it determined it wasn't responsible for
expenses Pierce incurred during the subcommittee investigation.
   ``I couldn't believe that of several potential grounds that
perhaps they might have used to justify not paying it, the one they
used seemed so off-the-wall,'' Plotkin said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said ``our decision
was based on the civil division's interpretation of the law. The
lawyers took a look at it and that's their decision.''
   Plotkin said the Justice Department stretched hard to formulate
an interpretation of the regulations that allowed it to avoid
making a politically difficult decision on Pierce's request.
   The regulation states that current and former federal officials
``may be provided representation in civil and congressional
proceedings and in state criminal proceedings ... when the actions
for which representation is requested reasonably appear to have
been performed within the scope of the employee's employment and
providing representation would otherwise be in the interest of the
United States.''
   ``One would think that clearly, on it's face we are eligible,''
Plotkin said. ``And then they have to exercise their discretion as
to whether or not they want to pay it.''
   But in an Oct. 25 letter to HUD, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General Stephen C. Bransdorfer said that legal representation by
the Justice Department ``is available only in situations where the
employee is subject to civil or state criminal proceedings as a
result of actions taken within the normal scope of that employee's
authority.
   ``If there are no such underlying proceedings then
representation is not available,'' Bransdorfer said.
   There are no civil or state criminal proceedings against Pierce.
   According to Bransdorfer's determination, HUD said it was
recommending that Pierce's request be denied.

   The tests, conducted over 3{ hours at Bethesda Naval Hospital,
included a complete physical, dental and eye exams, chest X-ray,
lab work for cholesterol and triglycerides and stress and
dermatological tests, spokesman Craig Whitney said.
   ``He passed all the tests and he's in excellent health,''
Whitney added.
   The exam was supervised by Dr. Martin Bacon of the White House
physician's staff.
   It was the 42-year-old Quayle's first full medical checkup as
vice president. He was told to come back in a year for another
check, Whitney said.

<TEXT>
   Trying to get control of a sticky situation,
Florida's Turnpike is eschewing gum.
   Chewing gum isn't sold anywhere on the road's 309 miles _
especially in the clean new rest stations that dot the length of
the turnpike.
   ``So many times, the gum winds up on the sidewalk, on the
floors, under the tables, in the carpet,'' said Jim Butch, the
manager of the Lake Worth rest station. ``That's the reason.''
   The new stations opened in September, but the gum ban has been
in effect for two years, ever since the Marriott Corp. took control
of turnpike restaurants and rest stations.
   Not everyone is happy with the restriction.
   Highway Patrol Lt. Phil Moan stocks the glove compartment of his
cruiser with gum and packs his own stash when he goes to Palm Beach
International Airport, which has also banned gum sales.
   ``I'm going to have to become a gumshoe on this, and stick to
it,'' he said, not apologizing for the pun.

leave Wenceslas Square during demonstrations and four TV cameramen,
including two from Atlanta-based Cable News Network, were detained
by police.
   ``We strongly urge the release of our colleagues from detention

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``The Final Days,'' a movie about
President Nixon's last weeks in office during the Watergate
scandal, was second to CBS on Sunday in overnight ratings for 21
cities, ABC estimates showed Monday.
   The television drama, the making of which had drawn criticism
from Nixon through his lawyers, averaged a 12.6 rating and 20
percent share of the audience in its three-hour time period.
   The film, a dramatization of the 1976 best seller by Carl
Bernstein and Robert Woodward, did better in Washington, D.C.
Although it also was second to CBS there, it averaged a 15.3 rating
and a 24 per cent share.
   In the 21-city overnight ratings, CBS won the night with ``60
Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and a TV movie, ``The Lady
Forgets.'' CBS averaged an 18.5 rating and a 29 percent share.
   NBC was third, averaging a 10.1 rating and 16 percent share for
its 8-to-11 p.m. roster of ``Sister Kate,'' ``My Two Dads'' and a
TV movie, ``Double Your Pleasure.''
   Ratings represent the number of homes tuned in and shares the
percentage of audience tuned to a given program. National audience
estimates for Sunday night won't be available until Tuesday, a
spokeswoman for A.C. Nielsen Co. said.

<HEAD>White House Status Quo as Republicans Search for Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans frustrated by a lack of
guidance from the White House searched Monday for a compromise on
raising the minimum wage in the hope of avoiding a partisan fight
as an election year looms.
   The White House didn't publicly rule out a compromise, but said
that for now it stood by its offer to raise the hourly minimum wage
from $3.35 to $4.25 by January 1992 _ a year later than the
Democratic proposal due for a vote Wednesday.
   ``We are not changing our position at this point,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. Chief of Staff John Sununu is
discussing the issue with congressional leaders, Fitzwater said.
   But even Republicans said the White House was doing little more
than listening, and it appeared the administration was losing the
support of some conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans who
helped Bush win a veto battle on the issue earlier this year.
   One of those conservative Democrats, Rep. Timothy Penny of
Minnesota, said it appeared the White House had abandoned thoughts
of striking a deal.
   ``It sounds like they're digging in their heals again,'' he
said. ``Picking another fight like this is causing a lot of us to
question their sincerity because a deal is within reach.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the discussions
were continuing, but added: ``I don't know how fruitful they are.''
   Even an administration official close to the negotations
complained of ``a lack of focus'' from the White House that had
``left dangling'' the GOP leadership. The Republicans had hoped to
strike a compromise to avoid another veto fight, a potential issue
in 1990 congressional elections.
   Because of the White House position, the Republican leadership
was mulling a number of proposals of its own, with a whip count
planned for Tuesday likely to determine the final shape of the
measure it will offer as an alternative to the Democrats' plan.
   The Democrats also planned a head count, and were mulling
changes designed to win back enough conservative Democrats to
override a second Bush veto.
   Even the administration official said the Democratic leadership
was within reach of winning a veto-proof majority in the House.
   ``Some of the votes we got last time we got with the message
very clear that it was `this time and this time only,''' said the
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``Right now it's
probably five or six votes either way.''
   The current bill would increase the minimum wage to $3.80 on
Jan. 1 and to $4.25 on Jan. 1, 1991. It also would allow workers
with fewer than two months job experience to be paid a subminimum
wage.
   Penny and other conservative Democrats want the two 45-cent
increases pushed back to April 1, 1990, and April 1, 1991, and the
``subminimum'' period extended to three or four months.
   ``That would make a big difference to several members,'' he said.
   Bush has insisted that to get his signature a minimum wage bill
also would have to allow employers to pay all new workers a
subminimum for up to six months regardless or prior job experience.
Democrats have said they would never accept such language.
   In addition to next year's elections, two other factors have
strengthened the Democrats' hand.
   The $4.25-an-hour target is more acceptable to many conservative
Democrats than the $4.55 level in the measure Bush vetoed. Also,
the fight over Bush's attempt to cut the capital gains tax has
allowed the Democratic leadership to shape the issue as one of rich
vs. poor.

<TEXT>
   France and New Zealand are going into
secret arbitration to end a dispute arising from French sinking of
the Rainbow Warrior at Auckland and a settlement is expected by
Saturday, diplomats said.
   The Rainbow Warrior yacht was sent by Operation Greenpeace to
lead a flotilla protesting French nuclear testing in the South
Pacific. French agents mined the ship July 10, 1985. The Rainbow
Warrior sank and a Portuguese-born Dutch photographer who was
aboard was killed.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
arbitration before a tribunal begins Tuesday. They said they expect
the arbitration to be wrapped up by the weekend, but the decision
will not be announced until later.
   The tribunal met on Monday but only to discuss procedural
matters, said a New Zealand official, speaking privately.
   New Zealand says France violated a 1986 agreement meditated by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar by letting two French
agents convicted in the bombing leave detention before their terms
ended.
   Uruguayan law professor Eduardo Jiminez de Arechaga heads the
panel, which also consists of French appointee Jean-Denis Bredin
and New Zealand appointee Sir Kenneth Keith.
   Attorney-General David Lange, the former prime minister, will
lead New Zealand's legal team.
   The two French secret agents who sank the ship, Alain Mafart and
Dominique Prieur, pleaded guilty to arson and manslaughter in
November 1985 and were sentenced to 10-year prison terms by a New
Zealand court.
   Perez de Cuellar later mediated a settlement under which France
paid New Zealand $7 million in compensation, and New Zealand agreed
to commute the prison terms if the two agents were detained on a
French atoll until the end of 1989.
   In 1987, however, Mafart returned to France, complaining of a
stomach ailment. In 1988, Ms. Prieur went home because she was
pregnant. France flew both agents home and both received promotions
on their return.
   New Zealand protested and wants the two returned to custody.

   A senator put the nomination of James Cason as
assistant secretary of agriculture on hold Monday, calling Cason
``a James Watt clone.''
   ``I think he would be a disaster,'' Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
said of the man President Bush wants to head forest and
conservation programs at the Agriculture Department.
   Reid's request that the nomination be put on hold prevents full
Senate debate until Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
removes the hold.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has urged the Senate to
confirm Cason as quickly as possible and has said that he expects
Cason to follow the environmental agenda he sets.
   ``He feels confident that Jim Cason is the person to do the
job,'' said Yeutter spokeswoman Kelly Shipp.
   Reid said he disapproved of decisions Cason has made as a
high-ranking Interior Department official, such as liberalizing
strip mining in national parks.
   ``I think he (Cason) is a James Watt clone,'' Reid said.
   Watt was the controversial Reagan administration official who
resigned under public pressure.
   Cason was hired at the Interior Department while Watt was
secretary, but he said during confirmation hearings that he barely
knew Watt.
   Agriculture Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., also opposes
Cason, though his committee voted 12-7 to send the nomination to
the full Senate.
   Cason, 35, has held a variety of high-ranking posts at the
Interior Department since the early days of the Reagan
administration. Leahy accused him of consistently putting private
interests ahead of public ones.

<HEAD>Earl Of Balfour Says Israel Must Keep Present Boundaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earl of Balfour, whose granduncle wrote
a declaration supporting establishment of a Jewish national home in
Palestine, said Monday that Israel must keep its present
``protectable'' boundaries.
   Balfour is in this northern port for a symposium on the 1917
Balfour Declaration, which opens Tuesday. The declaration is a
major document in the history of the Zionist movement and in the
history of Israel's establishment.
   ``Lawrence of Arabia promised to the Arabs that every country
will keep what she fought for but I did not find any evidence that
there was any Arab country that fought on the Jordan valley,'' he
told a reporter.
   ``Therefore when it comes to the present boundaries of Israel,
including what's inside, Israel has to keep and protect and develop
her boundaries ... because these boundaries are protectable,''
Balfour said.
   ``You fought for this country and it belongs to you.''
   His reference was to T.E. Lawrence, who rallied Arabs to fight
on the side of Britain in World War I.
   Israel's former prime minister, Menachem Begin, was invited to
attend the symposium but instead sent a letter, saying Israel would
remember the Balfour Declaration as ``a turning point in the
history of the Jewish people.''
   However, he accused Britain of changing the document's meaning
over the years, focusing on ``the Land of Israel instead of the
Land of Israel as home for the Jewish people ... when millions of
Jews cried for a homeland.''
   Israel was created in 1948 after more than a half-century of
efforts by Zionist leaders to establish a sovereign nation as a
homeland for Jews.
   Begin, 76, referred to the Zionist draft of the document that
called for reconstituting Palestine ``as the National Home of the
Jewish people.''
   The Nov. 2, 1917, declaration written in the form of a letter to
the president of the British Zionist Federation stated that ``His
Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in
Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.''
   Begin became prime minister in 1977 and resigned abruptly in
August 1983. Aides said then that he was depressed over the death
of his wife and over Israel's protracted involvement in Lebanon
following its June 1982 invasion.
   He has lived mostly in seclusion since then.

   Nicaragua's leader Daniel Ortega
asked President Carlos Menem to organize political support to
demobilize the Nicaraguan rebels, Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo
said Monday.
   Menem ``responded that he is going to do everything possible to
help achieve peace in that region,'' Cavallo added. ``Right away,
I'm going to begin talks with (hemispheric) foreign ministers to
see what we can do.''
   But Menem, speaking with reporters about his talks Sunday with
the Nicaraguan leader in Managua said Argentina would not mediate
the dispute.
   ``We just talked. Don't take this as a kind of mediation or
anything like that. It was simply a gesture of good faith'' he said.
   Menem and Cavallo made their comments in separate meetings with
reporters and it was unclear what role Argentina might play in the
Nicaraguan conflict.
   Both returned Monday from San Jose, Costa Rica, where they and
leaders from more than a dozen nations, including President Bush,
attended Costa Rica's weekend celebration of its 100th anniversary
of independence.
   The Argentine delegation made a stopover in Nicaragua and Menem
spoke for 90 minutes with President Ortega.
   In Managua, Menem indicated he might intervene on Ortega's
behalf with Central American governments and President Bush to seek
a U.S. commitment to demobilize the Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras.
   Menem was quoted as saying, ``I have taken upon myself the task
of making those gestures.
   ``We have appealed to the good will of the Nicaraguan
government, but we are going to work so that the presidential
accords of Tela, Honduras, are fulfilled by the demobilization of
the Contras and by this arrive at peace in Central America.''
   Ortega was quoted as saying Menem's offer ``is the first
concrete action to save the critical situation in which Nicaragua
is living. We are going to take very much into account the decision
of President Menem.''
   Back in Buenos Aires, Menem was asked if his comments meant he
would try to mediate the Nicaraguan dispute.
   ``I don't see that because it should be the U.S. government
directly'' he said, referring to Washington's support of the rebels.
   Ortega stunned the other leaders at the Costa Rican celebrations
when he announced his Sandinista government may end a unilateral
cease-fire in the war with the Contras. He accused the rebels of
violating the accord signed in Tela, Honduras, on Aug. 7 by himself
and four other Central American presidents.
   The accords call for free elections in Nicaragua, which Ortega's
government says will be held in February, and demobilization of the
Contras by Dec. 5.
   Most of the estimated 11,000 rebels operate out of bases in
Honduras near the border with Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Japan Joins International Ban on Ivory Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan, which buys more ivory than any other
country, said Monday it would join a ban on the ivory trade that is
intended to protect African elephants.
   The ban was adopted Oct. 17 at a meeting of the 91-nation
Convention on Trade in Endangered Species and is to remain in
effect at least until 1992.
   Japan had until Jan. 18 to decide whether to file an appeal,
which would allow it to continue trading ivory with other countries
that did the same or with the more than 60 nations outside the
accord.
   Hajime Tsujimoto of the Foreign Ministry's U.N. office
acknowledged that international attention on Japan as the world's
main ivory consumer had played a role in the decision.
   He also told reporters the decision did not necessarily mean
Japan was out of the market permanently, and that it ``may import
if the circumstances in the world change.''
   If the elephant is removed from the endangered species list, he
said, ``the story will be different.''
   Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique have objected to the
ban on grounds their elephant herds are not endangered and they
depend on ivory sales to finance successful conservation. By filing
for exemptions, they may continue trade in ivory with other
countries that do not accept the ban.
   A recent census estimated Africa now has about 600,000
elephants, fewer than half the total of a decade ago.
   About 30,000 people in Japan are employed in the ivory industry,
which carves elephant tusks into ornaments, jewelry and personal
signature seals.
   Tsujimoto said some might have to find other jobs eventually,
but Japan has enough ivory in stock to last about two years.
   Japan regularly has taken about 40 percent of the world's ivory
exports. Imports totaled 106 tons in 1988 and 143 tons in 1987.
   It is to be host of the next meeting of the convention, in April
1992.
   Tsujimoto said Japan would like to study aid to African
countries for better management of elephant populations.
   ``We are deeply concerned about the rapid decline in the number
of elephants over the last 10 years,'' he said. ``We believe
drastic measures should be taken to prevent further decline in the
number and seek proper protection of the animals.''
   In Hong Kong, up to 400 ivory traders and carvers marched
through downtown streets Monday to protest the ban. Adeline Li of
the Hong Kong and Kowloon Ivory Manufacturers' Association said
about 4,000 people worked in the industry in Hong Kong.

   The Gorbachev confidant who is now Pravda's editor
met the foreign press Monday and made himself the target, a
definite change at a paper that has bashed imperialists mercilessly
for generations.
   Asked how he will stop a sharp decline in readership in
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's era of glasnost, or openness, Ivan
Frolov said: ``We shall not seek to increase circulation at all
costs.''
   Although he offered some ideas for enlivening the gray columns _
interviews with members of the ruling Politburo, for instance _ the
60-year-old editor seemed to hold weak commitment by today's
Communists as responsible as the party daily's content for its
flagging fortunes.
   ``I can ask the question even more directly: Do we need more
genuine Communists, members of the CPSU, than the already known
number of Pravda subscribers?'' Frolov said, implying that the real
Communist today is one who dutifully reads the paper.
   Only one week into his new job, the white-haired former
Gorbachev adviser already has done something that would have been a
surprise coming from his remote predecessor Viktor Afanasyev, who
ran the paper for 13 years.
   Frolov opened Pravda's 8th floor conference room to foreign
correspondents and sought their questions.
   It was a unique opportunity to hear the views of a member of the
policy-making party Central Committee now in charge of the most
authoritative, if no longer most widely read, Soviet newspaper.
   As is the custom in such confrontations, Frolov occasionally
avoided straight answers _ on Pravda's circulation, for example.
   ``We don't have definitive information; the circulation was once
10,700,000; it will probably be less,'' he said from the head of a
rectangle of wooden tables pushed together to make room for more
than 100 journalists, all but a few of them foreigners.
   Pravda, officially the organ of the party Central Committee, now
has tough competition from other dailies that have taken advantage
of glasnost to publish more daring or spicier stories.
   Also, Soviet citizens no longer are required to take Pravda to
get another publication they really want, such as a literary
monthly or a magazine about movies.
   A Pravda official told a Westerner who visited the paper last
month that only 3 million to 4 million people had subscribed for
next year.
   Frolov said research would be used to determine why Pravda's
readership has dropped. He said there would be ``some innovations''
to tempt readers, among them exclusive publication of some Central
Committee documents.
   ``After Politburo meetings, we shall publish interviews with the
leaders of the party on what they personally think of the subjects
raised there,'' he said.
   It would be a departure if Politburo members were persuaded to
give their personal views on its decisions, customarily made in
secret and always presented as unanimous.
   Frolov made clear Pravda will not become the pugnacious,
Western-style newspaper some Soviets say is needed to safeguard the
public interest.
   ``I must say, the decision about coverage of Central Committee
or Politburo events is made by the appropriate bodies, and you will
agree that it is quite proper and that they ought to have the
authority to do it,'' he said, defending the party's right to do
business behind closed doors.
   That was his response when asked why Pravda and other papers had
not printed an account of the meeting earlier this month with
ranking editors, in which Gorbachev was said to have accused some
of excesses or ideological errors.
   Western reporters found that many Soviet journalists who
attended the technically secret meeting were ready to talk about it.
   How does Frolov see the future of the newspaper founded by Lenin
in 1912 as a tool to whip up hostility to the czar among workers?
   ``We shall not become a non-serious, light paper,'' he said.
``We shall not chase hot news, publish non-verified facts or poorly
analyzed materials. We shall not seek to increase circulation at
all costs.''
   Pravda, he said, will try to ``express the very essence of
present-day party policies.''
   That does not mean Frolov shuns making the paper more attractive.
   ``As far as I am concerned, there can be nothing more attractive
than good analysis,'' said the editor, a graduate in philosopy from
Moscow State University.

   Police said they had some leads Monday
in the deaths of two elderly women whose blood-drenched bodies were
found in homes 500 yards apart, 12 hours after they returned from
the same church service.
   The two women were beaten, stabbed and apparently robbed over
the weekend, authorities said.
   ``We've got leads and we hope to make an arrest or arrests,''
said Cpl. R.A. Miller of the Boone County Sheriff's Department.
   The slayings stunned people in the small community, about 25
miles south of Madison.
   ``This has tore everybody all to pieces,'' said Beth Kinder of
Charleston, who was in Bald Knob on Monday visiting her mother.
``Now people are panicking. We've never had anything like this
happen.''
   The body of Faye Jarrell, 83, was found Sunday morning after a
neighbor knocked on her door and got no answer. A short time later,
another person spotted an open door next door and notified police,
who found the body of Dorothy Daniels, 68.
   Both had last been seen Saturday night at the Bald Knob
Methodist Church, where they attended a wake for a neighbor.
   Both victims' homes had been ransacked and were missing small
items, Miller said. But he said more valuable items usually taken
during a robbery, such as televisions and prescription drugs, had
not been touched.
   ``The motive we're looking at right now is robbery,'' Miller
said. ``We can't substantiate any other motive at this time.''
   Miller said an autopsy showed that both victims had been stabbed
repeatedly and beaten.
   ``There is no evidence of gunshot wounds,'' Miller said. ``...
There was a considerable amount of blood.
   The victims apparently lived modestly, and there was no
indication of what prompted the attack, Miller said.
   ``They didn't appear wealthy,'' he said. ``They were elderly and
lived alone. Nothing extravagant. They were neat in their houses.
It looked like one lady had done some quilting.''
   Rose Belcher, who lives a half-mile from the two houses, said
she had known the victims all her life.
   ``They were well thought-of in the community,'' she said. ``It's
a big shock to all of us. My only thought is someone must have
thought they had some money. It's so sick.''

   Former President Richard Nixon said Monday that
China and the United States must overcome their ``huge and
unbridgeable'' differences over China's harsh crackdown on dissent
and resume cooperation.
   Nixon, speaking at a banquet hosted by Premier Li Peng, also
called for a ``humanely governed China'' that won't ``turn away
from greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression
and stagnation.''
   Li responded by reiterating the Chinese position that the United
States, not China, is responsible for the deterioration in
relations and must take the first steps toward reconciliation.
   ``If the United States takes any positive action, the Chinese
side will welcome and respond to it,'' the official news agency
Xinhua quoted the premier as saying.
   Nixon, on the third day of a private visit, is the most
prominent American to come to China since the military assault on
student-held Tiananmen Square in June.
   He is expected to brief President Bush on his visit, which
includes a scheduled meeting with senior leader Deng Xiaoping on
Tuesday.
   His message to Chinese officials was clear: conflict over the
June killings may never be reconciled, but Washington and Beijing
must forge ahead with their relations.
   Addressing Li, who ordered martial law troops into Beijing,
Nixon said differences between ``you, a Chinese Communist who
believes in Leninist rule (and) I, an American conservative who
believes in capitalism and democracy, are too great to permit a
common understanding.''
   But he added: ``Let us not become mired in endless and fruitless
recriminations over the seeming impasse that has now developed
between our two countries. Both of our nations must now deal
realistically with the aftermath.''
   The United States and China have indicated they want to resolve
one of their deepest rifts since Nixon's historic 1972 visit ended
their long freeze in official contacts. Both, however, have called
on the other to act first.
   When asked about Nixon's statement that it was time to normalize
relations, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We have
always said that we want to resume good relations with China at
some point. The question really is, when and under what conditions?
I would say that at this point we have not reached that time and we
have not seen the right conditions.''
   Asked if Nixon was carrying a letter from Bush to the Chinese
leadership, Fitzwater said, ``I'm not aware of a letter.'' He added
that Nixon talked to Bush and National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft before he left, ``so maybe he interpreted that
conversation as some kind of message.''
   The Bush administration responded to the June crackdown by
suspending high-level meetings and cutting off arms sales. China
says it was justified in putting down a ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion'' and has accused the United States of trying to
undermine its socialist system and interfering in its internal
affairs by citing human rights abuses.
   ``We still have common concerns that make cooperation between
China and the United States an indispensable element in ensuring
the welfare of our two peoples and serving the cause of peace and
prosperity in the world,'' Nixon said.
   ``It is neither in China's nor America's interest for your
nation of over 1 billion people to return to its isolation. The
certain result would be an angry and impoverished nation.''
   China has a clear choice, he said. ``Shall China turn away from
greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression and
stagnation? Or does it continue to venture forth on the open seas
on a journey which may at times be rough but which leads to
progress and peace and justice for its people?''
   The two nations, he said, must ``rise above the acrimony of the
moment and resume the progress and cooperation that are worthy of
two great peoples.''
   At a dinner after Nixon's arrival Saturday, Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen praised China's ``old friend'' for his ``foresight and
sagacity.''
   Qian's speech was generally conciliatory, although he said it is
up to the United States to ``weigh the pros and cons and take a
forward-looking apporach so that Chinese-U.S. relations may return
to the track of normal development at an early date.''
   Nixon also met with Li Ruihuan, mayor of the northeastern
industrial city of Tianjin and one of China's rising political
stars.
   Li, who was appointed to the party's decision-making Politburo
Standing Committee after the fall of reformist party chief Zhao
Ziyang in June, said socialism is China's ``historical choice.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted him as saying it is
impossible for China to carry out reforms without adhering to
socialism, and it is hard to stick to the socialist system without
implementing reforms.

<HEAD>Report 149 People Arrested During Demonstration to be Charged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government news media said
Monday that 149 of the 355 demonstrators arrested during an
anti-government protest will be charged with violating public order.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said the 149 were detained
for 48 hours and all of the others arrested during the
demonstration Saturday in Prague were released soon after they had
been seized.
   Rude Pravo did not say if the 149 were still in jail and an
Interior Ministry official said only that they had been held for 48
hours.
   At a regular news conference Monday, deputy goverment spokesman
Marcel Jansen quickly told reporters he had no official statement
on the demonstration and they should address questions to chief
government spokesman Miroslav Pavel, who is on vacation.
   The party newspaper said the 149 would be charged under
anti-demonstration laws passed earlier this year that impose fines
of up to $2,000.
   More than 10,000 people gathered Saturday in Prague's Wenceslas
Square to mark the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence.
They chanted calls for free elections, a new government and the
removal of Communist Party leader Milos Jakes.
   Rude Pravo said five policemen and seven demonstrators were
injured in clashes during the rally but all had been treated and
none remained hospitalized.
   The state media provided no information about 17 foreigners
reported detained during the rally, other than repeat the report
and say the foreigners were from 11 different countries.
   Rude Pravo again accused the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe and
Voice of America radio stations for the anti-government
demonstration.
   In Washington, the State Department criticized the crackdown on
the pro-democracy rally.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said, ``The people of
Czechoslovakia know what democracy is and they want it now.''
   ``The U.S. calls on the government of Czechoslovakia to respect
the rights of its citizens and to institute the basic freedoms
desired by the Czechoslovakian people.''
   The newspaper Mlada Fronta, published for Communist youths, did
not take the hard line followed by Rude Pravo.
   Rude Pravo referred to the people surrounded and attacked by
riot police in Wenceslas Square as the ``aggressive'' core of the
demonstration.
   Mlada Fronta said about 300 demonstrators were involved and they
were peaceful. It noted the people chanted demands to police not to
use violence and shouted, ``We have bare hands!'' raising their
arms to show they were unarmed.

   Most Americans favor rapprochement with Iran in
exchange for the release of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon, even
though they see the Islamic republic as a sponsor of world
terrorism, a national poll has found.
   Ten years after the Iran hostage crisis poisoned U.S.-Iran
relations, 61 percent in the Media General-Associated Press poll
said Washington should offer to resume normal ties if Iran got the
Americans in Lebanon freed.
   Support was somewhat lower for releasing Iranian assets locked
in U.S. banks in trade for the hostages' freedom, with 50 percent
in favor. And respondents overwhelmingly rejected paying ransom
directly to the captors, with 85 percent opposed.
   Respondents divided evenly on the idea of direct negotiations
with the hostage takers, while most favored indirect negotiations.
A majority favored military action, but that fell to a minority if
the hostages might be killed in the effort.
   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are held in
Lebanon, most by groups believed loyal to Iran. Iran has offered to
help free the captives if its assets held in U.S. banks were
released.
   It is unclear to what extent Iran controls the captors, if at
all. In the poll, though, 72 percent said they believed Iran does
control the hostage takers, and 79 percent said Iran supports
international terrorism.
   Iran and the United States have been estranged since Nov. 4,
1979, when Iranian students, apparently with official support,
seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage.
   They were held for 444 days, crippling President Carter's
administration and contributing to his defeat in the 1980 election.
A rescue attempt failed, killing eight servicemen, and the
prisoners were freed only on Jan. 20, 1981, the day of Ronald
Reagan's inauguration.
   Reagan and now President Bush have labored with another hostage
crisis, the Americans captive in Lebanon. Longest held is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
kidnapped in March 1985.
   Washington's official position has been that negotiating for the
captives' release would encourage more hostage taking. Forty-seven
percent in the poll nonetheless favored direct negotiations, while
45 percent opposed the idea. The rest were unsure.
   A majority, 55 percent, favored indirect negotiations through a
third party such as the Red Cross.
   Respondents at first blush supported military action, with 62
percent favoring the use of U.S. forces to try to free the
hostages. But if the hostages might be killed in a rescue attempt _
something strategists have been unable to rule out _ just 43
percent supported it.
   Military action was more popular with men and with people who
described themselves as conservatives, while liberals and women
were more apt to favor some form of negotiation. Fifty-four percent
of the women supported direct talks with the hostage takers,
compared with 40 percent of the men.
   The poll found some dismay at the length of the crisis, with 54
percent saying the United States has not done enough to try to free
the hostages. Yet there was a split in expectations of whether they
ever will be freed: Forty-two percent thought they would, 37
percent thought not, and 21 percent were unsure.
   The survey was conducted by telephone Sept. 14-24 among a random
sample of 1,071 adults in the continental United States, and had a
margin of error of 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>St. Paul Fire Chief To Step Aside While Allegations Investigated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city fire chief is stepping aside
while officials look into allegations he had links to arsonists,
Mayor George Latimer announced Monday.
   Reports about Fire Chief Stephen Conroy are ``shocking and
disturbing,'' Latimer said.
   ``If there was wrongdoing, it will be prosecuted and
penalized,'' the mayor said in announcing Conroy would take paid
administrative leave.
   Latimer also said firefighters have been barred from
moonlighting for fire adjusting companies, a practice criticized by
fire experts quoted in Sunday's report in the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis.
   The Star Tribune reported that properties owned by Conroy or his
brother, Patrick, have had 11 fires in the past 25 years. It also
noted that two associates of Patrick Conroy were convicted of arson
in 1986.
   Stephen Conroy told the newspaper that he has no connections
with any ``fire industry'' in St. Paul, and said his department
``is looked on as one of the better fire departments in the
country.'' His brother denied any involvement in arson.
   ``We are confident that after a thorough investigation, we will
be totally exonerated from any wrongdoing of any nature,'' said
Earl P. Gray, an attorney representing Stephen Conroy.
   Latimer said Conroy requested an examination by outside
investigators so he could clear his name. He added that the chief
agreed to cooperate fully with the investigators, and volunteered
to take the administrative leave.
   ``I did not have to urge him. He made the offer,'' the mayor
said. ``He obviously is in a lot of pain and is very sad today.''
   Latimer said Ramsey County Attorney Tom Foley has agreed that
the investigation into the allegations should be handled by an
outside agency,
   The newspaper report said the fire chief has allowed
firefighters to moonlight for an adjusting company that has
represented alleged arsonists in fire insurance claims. It also
said shoddy investigations by the department have helped arson
thrive.
   The newspaper said its report focused on more than 200 fires in
St. Paul over the past 25 years that in some way involved Stephen
or Patrick Conroy, public adjuster William Whelan, or their friends
and associates.
   The newspaper said Stephen Conroy gave $10,000 to set Whelan up
in business as a public adjuster before becoming chief. It also
said that Whelan's most frequent contractor has been Patrick
Conroy, and that companies owned by Whelan and Patrick Conroy have
received millions of dollars in insurance money from St. Paul fires.
   Asked why many of his cases involved arson fires, Whelan said,
``I have no idea.'' He said arsonists who have worked on his staff
were not known arsonists at the time.
   The Star Tribune said its reporters examined more than 10,000
pages of documents and interviewed hundreds of people.
   City police and the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension raised
questions about Stephen Conroy 10 years ago, but their
investigation died amid political squabbles, the newspaper said.
   Latimer said Deputy Fire Chief John Colonna, 43, who has been
with the department for 18{ years, will serve as acting chief while
Conroy is on leave.
   Colonna said he hopes the latest allegations can be cleared up
quickly.
   ``It's easy for anyone to see that these kinds of articles would
affect the morale of the Fire Department,'' he said. ``That's why
it's so important that this be brought to a public conclusion.''
   Latimer, who has served as mayor since 1976, is not seeking
re-election in next Tuesday's general election.

<HEAD>Amnesty Reports Unabated Use of Torture in Turkey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said Tuesday that anyone
detained in Turkey for suspected political offenses is in danger of
being tortured.
   The worldwide human rights organization said use of torture to
obtain information or confessions from political prisoners
continued unabated on a wide scale in violation of international
treaties signed and ratified by Turkey last year.
   London-based Amnesty said in a new report that more than 500
political prisoners alleged they were tortured in Turkey so far
this year and 10 such prisoners were said to have died in custody
as a result of being tortured.
   Amnesty said most of the allegations relate to initial
interrogations in police custody while detainees were routinely
denied access to lawyers or relatives.
   It said that while its report does not discuss torture of
criminal prisoners, ``they, too, are frequently reported to have
been ill-treated and tortured.''
   Amnesty reported ``the government ... has consistently denied
that torture is systematic in Turkey and has described those
instances of torture which it admits as the isolated actions of
individuals.''
   The organization welcomed as a step in the right direction draft
amendments to the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code announced in
September. But it said they fall short of international standards
that require all detainees be brought before a judge soon after
detention and have prompt access to lawyers, doctors and relatives.
   The proposals, which still must be approved by the Turkish Grand
National Assembly, would shorten the maximum detention period to
four to 10 days and grant lawyers access to detainees. The maximum
detention period permitted before a detainee is either formally
charged or released now is 24 hours. In political cases it may be
extended to 15 days, however, and under emergency legislation up to
30 days.
   Specific cases cited by Amnesty include 21 students held
incommunicado at Ankara police headquarters on the day the
government announced the draft amendments. The students later said
they were tortured while being interrogated.
   One, 20-year-old Yusuf Ali Yildiz, said that during six days in
custody he was stripped naked, hosed down with pressurized cold
water, beaten and given electric shocks.
   The report also cited the death of Seyhmus Orhan from Yoncali
village in southeastern Turkey. It said he died on July 18 after 24
hours of interrogation at the Command of the 118th Gendarmerie
Regiment. Officials said he was shot trying to escape. Other
detainees and relatives said he was killed under torture and shot
afterward.
   Amnesty, winner of the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize, said statements
extracted under torture are used as evidence against political
prisoners.
   It said the Maltaya State Security Court convicted four people
in September of belonging to the illegal organization Devrimci Yol
(Revolutionary Path) without investigating their allegations that
their confessions were extracted under torture.
   The defendants told the court they were stripped, hosed with
ice-cold water, beaten and given electric shocks, Amnesty said. One
said he confessed when police threatened to torture his wife.
   Amnesty said it repeatedly urged the Turkish government to take
effective steps to prevent torture and to meet its obligations
under European and United Nations conventions for the prevention of
torture.
   It said it also asked Turkey to establish independent and
impartial procedures to investigate allegations of torture and to
ensure that statements extracted under torture are not used as
evidence against defendants.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government imposed steep increases on
energy prices, effective Wednesday, in conjunction with a revised
budget passed by Parliament that slashes coal subsidies.
   The price increases and spending cuts were the latest exercise
in fiscal toughness from the 2-month-old government led by Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Solidarity in its effort to control
the economic crisis.
   A Finance Ministry statement Monday said electricity would go up
150 percent, natural gas 100 percent and bills for heat and hot
water 50 percent.
   ``Low retail prices of electricity, heat and gas fuels in
relation to the cost of production and to other fuels make it
necessary to increase retail prices,'' it said. ``This increase is
a logical result of the recent increase in the price of coal.''
   Similar price increases have brought down Communist governments
and led to the birth of Solidarity in 1980s as the Soviet bloc's
first independent trade union, but public forbearance toward
Mazowiecki continues.
   An official announcement Monday said donations to help support
his government had reached $138,000, most of it from individuals.
   Foreign governments also have offered tens of millions of
dollars' help in Poland's move toward democracy and a market
economy.
   The first grain shipment donated by the United States arrived
off the Baltic port of Gdynia on Monday. Washington said three
Cabinet members would lead a delegation arriving in late November
to determine how U.S. aid can be used most effectively.
   Parliament approved the amended budget Monday by a vote of
301-4, with 35 abstentions. It reduces the projected deficit from
9.2 trillion zlotys ($3.8 billion) to 4.7 trillion ($1.96 billion)
and trims subsidies for the coal industry by 1.2 trillion zlotys
($500 million).
   It puts expenditures at 34.4 trillion zlotys ($14.3 billion) in
1989 and income at 29.7 trillion zlotys ($12.4 billion).
   The government hopes partially closing the budget gap will
reduce the amount of money in circulation and slow inflation, now
at about 600 percent annually.
   Many food subsidies also have been trimmed, along with
government-financed projects and spending on social services.
   On Oct. 16, Parliament restricted an indexation plan that
provides automatic pay increases to counteract inflation.

<TEXT>
   The leader of a Soviet research station in
Antarctica has ordered his personnel to ship their garbage out of
the area, a spokesman for the Greenpeace environmental organization
said Monday.
   A message from the Greenpeace vessel Gondwana at King George
Island said the Soviet official had at first refused to do anything
about the accumulation of waste at the Bellingshausen base on the
island, about 600 miles from the southern tip of South America.
   ``The result of this action is a small but significant step
forward for the protection of the Antarctic,'' said Maj DePoorter,
the Belgian leader of the Greenpeace mission in a message to the
organization headquarters in Britain.
   Martin Leeburn, Greenpeace's spokesman in London, said the
Soviets reversed their stand after more than 20 Greenpeace members
collected rubbish from around the Soviet station and sent a protest
to the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Institute in Leningrad.
   He said the protest reported 40 bags of garbage had been
collected and returned to the leader of the Soviet station with a
demand that the rubbish be removed and disposed of properly.
   Ms. DePoorter, in her report, said that on Sunday the Greenpeace
members began to demonstrate as the Soviet resupply ship, Akademik
Fyodorov, anchored offshore. Greenpeace said the Soviet vessel has
a cargo capacity of more than 5,000 tons and was scheduled to leave
the station empty.
   Leeburn said that after a ``brief confrontation,'' the Soviet
official, who was not identified, ordered his personnel to load the
garbage aboard the ship for removal from Antarctica.
   Ms. DePoorter said in her message that the Greenpeace expedition
was told by the Soviet station leader on Friday that none of the
rubbish accumulated around the base over many years would be
removed.
   She said, ``The rubbish consisted of food scraps, empty bottles,
all sorts of glass receptacles, cans, old radio equipment, doors,
windows, beds, drums with rotten food, rusty propellers, engines
and piles of plastic ... all scattered over about 200 meters
(yards)`` and half covered by snow.
   Leeburn said the Gondwana went to King George Island to check on
the operations of the various stations. Garbage and other debris
does not decay in the cold and becomes a threat to the purity of
the wilderness and its wildlife, he said.
   He said the Greenpeace group reported the Bellingshausen
station, established in 1968, has a normal complement of about 29
people and twice as many in summer, ``which is now.''
   ``The Soviet station has no waste treatment plant, it burns
rubbish in open pits and sends nothing back to the Soviet Union,''
he said.
   Greenpeace said eight countries are active on King George Island
_ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Poland, the Soviet Union, South
Korea and Uruguay.

   A U.S. warplane accidentally dropped a
500-pound bomb on the guided-missile cruiser USS Reeves during
maneuvers in the Indian Ocean on Monday, slightly injuring five
sailors and leaving a five-foot hole in the deck, the Navy said.
   The bomb, which detonated upon impact, set off a small fire in
the ship's forecastle that was quickly extinguished, said Lt. Bruce
Cole, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.
   The fighter, a single-seat F-A-18 Hornet, had just taken off
from the aircraft carrier USS Midway when the incident occurred.
   ``We don't know yet why it happened,'' said another spokesman,
Cmdr. Mark Baker. ``The pilot has been returned to the Midway and
he is being asked that question now.''
   Cole said the five sailors received minor injuries ``as a result
of flying glass and concussion'' from the exploding bomb. The
sailors were treated on board their ship, and the Navy does not
plan to release their names until their families are told.
   The carrier and cruiser were conducting ``routine weapons
training'' about 32 miles from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean,
Cole and Baker said.
   Cole said the F-A-18's pilot ``inadvertently'' dropped the bomb,
apparently as it passed over the nearby cruiser. The spokesmen said
they did not know the altitude of the plane or how far apart the
two ships were.
   Although the bomb left a five-foot hole in the deck near the
cruiser's bow, it did no damage to the outer hull, Cole said.
   Such a ship is ``nuclear capable,'' but as they always do the
spokesmen refused to confirm whether nuclear weapons were aboard.
Such weapons _ anti-submarine rockets that are being phased out _
would be carried in a forward compartment of the ship.
   The cruiser was returning to the U.S. base at Diego Garcia under
its own power, Baker said.
   The bomb, a Mark 82 model, is four feet long and 14 inches in
diameter. It is a free-fall weapon that can be used against ships
or land targets and can be adapted for use as a shrapnel weapon
against humans, one Navy source said.
   The plane is a jet, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and first
put into service in 1982, which can serve as either a fighter or an
attack bomber.
   The incident occurred at 9:06 p.m. local time, Cole said.
   Standard time charts give that as the equivalent of 11:06 a.m.
EST, but the Navy gave the eastern time equivalent as 7:06 a.m.
There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
   Both the Midway, which is one of the Navy's oldest aircraft
carriers, and the Reeves are based in Yokosuka, Japan.
   The 533-foot Reeves is a Leahy class guided missile cruiser
displacing 7,800 tons fully loaded and carrying a complement of 450
officers and enlisted men, It was commissioned in 1964.
   The 980-foot-long Midway, displacing 64,000 tons at full load,
was commissioned in 1945 and has undergone a number of overhauls.
It carries a crew of approximately 2,500 officers and enlisted men.
   The accident was at least the sixth aboard a Navy ship, not
counting sailors lost overboard, since the April 19 turret
explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors.
   Only Sunday, a landing accident aboard the training carrier USS
Lexington off Florida killed a Navy student pilot and four members
of the deck crew and injured 19 others.
   The others:
   _May 9. Six sailors are killed and five injured in a fire aboard
the USS White Plains, a supply ship, in the Atlantic.
   _May 13: Two sailors die in a pump room fire aboard the aircraft
carrier USS America in the Atlantic.
   _May 19. A Marine is drowned when a landing craft from the
amphibious landing ship USS Duluth overturns during exercises off
Australia.
   _Aug. 23. Thirty civilians are injured when a pressure relief
valve sprays visitors with hydraulic fluid and water and panic
ensues aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kennedy at Port Everglades,
Fla.

   The Bush administration voiced opposition
Monday to proposed sanctions on countries that are helping spread
ballistic missile technology around the world, saying it can
accomplish more through diplomacy.
   Representatives from the Pentagon, State Department, Commerce
Department and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency were unanimous
in opposing the proposed sanctions legislation at a House Foreign
Affairs Committee hearing, despite prospects that the number of
countries with such technology will double within a decade.
   Richard Clarke, assistant secretary of state for
politico-military affairs, said the United States is seeking to
curb the spread of missile technology through the two-year-old
Missile Technology Control Regime. The agreement, which now has
seven member nations, is likely to grow to include more countries
after a meeting set for the first week in December, Clarke said.
   Mandating sanctions would ``threaten the regime's
effectiveness'' because it would inhibit exchanges of information
between signatory countries, said Clarke. ``The sanctions are
almost certain to have a chilling effect.''
   The sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.,
said he was not persuaded by the testimony. ``In the end, a regime
that has no penalties will not be as successful,'' he said. ``There
will be companies and countries that will see the lure of economic
benefit as overriding'' proliferation concerns. ``You have to hit
them in their economies.''
   Conspicuously absent from the Monday's hearing was any detailed
discussion of recent revelations that Israel has been aiding South
Africa in developing its own intermediate-range missile.
   Answering questions from reporters after the hearing, Clarke
acknowledged that the United States had learned through
intelligence channels in January of the Israel-South Africa
cooperation, and objected to Israeli officials at that time. ``We
are still having a dipolomatic dialogue'' with Israel on the
subject, he said.
   Berman's bill would bar companies from doing business with the
U.S. government or from receiving advanced technology which
requires a U.S. export license if they are found to be violating
the non-proliferation regime.
   Clarke acknowledged that the legislation could have the
potential for cutting U.S. aid to Israel, which has tremendous
political sensitivity, if there were continued transfers.
   ``If there were a government or corporate relationship with
South Africa, that might mandate that we terminate a variety of
programs with Israel,'' he said.
   Henry Sokolski, an international security official at the
Pentagon, said the Defense Department is ``seriously considering''
making compliance with export controls a condition of doing
business with the government for suppliers involved in the missile
technology. A decision in the department's upper echelons is
expected soon, he said.
   The transfer of missile technology has become an increasing
concern in the past three years, particularly in light of its
potential for providing destabilizing delivery mechanisms for
chemical and nuclear weapons.
   The control regime now includes seven countries: the United
States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Great Britain. It
seeks to control export of technology for missiles carrying
payloads of more than 1,100 pounds more than 190 miles. The Soviet
Union, China, Iran, Israel, North Korea and South Korea are among
other nations that have ballistic missile technology.

<DATELINE>TOOELE ARMY DEPOT, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials broke ground Monday for
the nation's first chemical weapons disposal plant, calling it a
step toward worldwide elimination of the lethal agents.
   Ambassador Ronald Lehman II, the Bush administration's chief
arms negotiator, said the Tooele Army Depot facility, dubbed
Chemical Disposal System No.1, represents the ``leading edge of
negotiations'' between the United States and the Soviet Union to
eliminate their chemical arsenals.
   The ceremony took place on a desolate, sagebrush-strewn plain
less than a quarter mile from concrete, dirt-covered igloos housing
more than 40 percent of the nation's aging chemical agent stockpile.
   The $212 million CDS1, 48 miles southwest of Salt Lake City,
will be the first of eight such U.S. facilities slated to dismantle
and incinerate old mustard and nerve gas weapons, many of which
date to World War II.
   The Tooele plant is scheduled for completion in 1992.
   Lehman and others said renewed negotiations with the Soviet
Union in Geneva have bolstered hopes for limiting and ultimately
destroying chemical weaponry.
   Rep. James V. Hansen, R-Utah, read a statement from President
Bush, who reiterated his commitment to a joint U.S.-Soviet effort
to eliminate both nations' chemical arsenals within the next decade.
   ``Today, we take another step along that path,'' Hansen quoted
Bush as saying. ``The chemical weapons destruction facility to be
built at Tooele says to all the world that the United States is
determined to fulfill its promises, that our people and our
government are committed to halting the spread of chemical weapons
and eliminating their very existence.''
   Bush has promised to reduce stockpiles to 20 percent of existing
weapons even before any treaty is signed, Hansen added.
   Much of that will be accomplished through destruction of the
rockets, canisters, artillery projectiles and other weaponry
containing chemical agents. Congress mandated destruction of the
weapons for safety reasons in 1985.
   Besides Tooele, other U.S. chemical stockpiles are at the Pine
Bluff Arsenal, Ark.; Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Umatilla Depot
Activity, Ore.; Newport Army Ammunition Plant, Ind.; Aberdeen
Proving Ground, Md.; Pueblo Depot Activity, Colo., and
Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.
   The eight-building CDS1 complex will be adjacent to igloos where
nearly 800 chemical weapons, many of them leaking, are stored.
Construction of the facility will employ about 300 people and is
expected to begin later this year.
   From February 1992 until January 1993, the 350 people needed to
operate the plant will be trained and simulated tests will be
conducted. Destruction of the weapons will begin in February 1993
and take about four years, the Army said.

   Temperatures dipped below zero in Colorado on Monday, the East
Coast basked in record warmth, and rain was scattered across the
nation's midsection.
   The rain marked the eastern edge of a cold front that reached
from the Great Lakes south to Texas. Temperatures were unusually
cold west of the front, but balmy to the east.
   The low temperature for the nation overnight was 2 degrees below
zero at Alamosa, Colo. Klamath Falls, Ore., set a record for the
date with a low of 19 degrees overnight.
   In contrast, high-temperature records fell in Alpena, Mich.,
where it was 73 degrees, and Concord, N.H., where it was 75.
Burlington, Vt., tied its old record of 70, and Portland, Maine,
matched its old record for the date of 71.
   Rain and thunderstorms from the cold front extended from the
upper and middle Texas coast to northeast and central Texas,
western Louisiana and Arkansas. Rain also reached from Missouri to
Iowa, southeast Minnesota, Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois.
   Rain also fell over the Carolinas, and snow showers were
scattered across southeast Nebraska.
   No measurable snowfall was reported during the 6 hours ending at
1 p.m. EST. Heavier rainfall during the same period included 1.4
inches at Killeen, Texas.
   Winds gusted to near 40 mph at Junction, Texas, and the
temperature dropped 17 degrees in less than an hour as the cold
front moved through the area.
   In North Dakota, advisories were posted for a cold, windy
Halloween night. The cold north winds are expected to bring snow
showers, temperatures into the teens and wind chills to 20 below
zero over western and central portions of the state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 22
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 88 at Corpus Christi
and Harlingen, Texas.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels fired at least
16 shells from homemade mortars at the Defense Ministry Monday but
most exploded in nearby streets, killing a gas station attendant
and wounding 15 other people.
   President Alfredo Cristiani accused Nicaragua's Sandinistas of
either supplying the weapons or parts and technical skill for their
construction to the rebels.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), an
umbrella organization of guerrilla groups, had announced in
February it was suspending the use of homemade mortars in populated
areas because their inaccuracy caused civilian casualties.
   Cristiani told a news conference the attack was ``an attempt by
the FMLN to give the impression it is strong.
   ``But they (the rebels) have only the capacity to stage
terrorist actions.''
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said
eight shells struck the grounds of the Armed Forces Social Club
adjacent to the ministry compound but no one was wounded there.
   Authorities said the other shells exploded in adjoining civilian
neighborhoods.
   Ponce reported 30 unfired shells were found on two trucks from
which the other shells had been launched. The trucks were in a
shopping mall about 300 yards from the military compound.
   The shells on one truck were covered with garlands of paper
flowers, the kind used in ceremonies marking the Day of the Dead
holiday on Nov. 2. Those on the other truck were covered with boxes
painted as speakers for a musical band.
   Ponce called the shelling ``indiscriminate terrorism,'' and also
accused Nicaragua's leftist government of providing the weapons for
the rebels.
   ``The FMLN lies when it talks about peace while at the same time
waging war,'' Ponce said, referring to recent efforts to negotiate
an end to the decade-old civil war.
   Representatives of Cristiani's rightist government and the FMLN
have met twice since September, but they are far apart on terms for
a cease-fire and have only agreed to continue the talks.
   Two shells exploded at a gasoline station about 800 yards away,
killing Ernesto Vasquez, 72, as he pumped gas. The blasts wounded
two attendants.
   ``I felt I was on a battlefield,'' said Francisco Morales, 27, a
mechanic, about 15 minutes after the attack.
   ``This is very bad,'' said Morales, who was shaken by the
deafening blasts and the carnage. ``They (the guerrillas) don't let
the humble people work, and we have to work.''
   The gas station was heavily damaged, but there was no fire.
   Another bomb fell at a nearby fried chicken restaurant, slightly
wounding a boy and causing extensive damage.
   Two mortar shells fell at the entrance to the military compound,
and three landed beyond the compound, on a sidewalk bordering a
parking lot next to the National Baseball Stadium. At least one
soldier and one civilian were wounded by those blasts, witnesses
said.
   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, chief of the armed forces press
committee, said no bombs fell inside the ministry compound.
   A soldier on duty at the gate said two bombs fell inside the
compound, but this could not be confirmed. Witnesses said they saw
one injured soldier being evacuated from the compound.
   The rebels staged a similar attack on Dec. 23, killing three
people and wounding 38. Only one of those casualties was a soldier.
   The rebels issued a communique Feb. 28 announcing they would
suspend such attacks because of ``faults and deficiencies'' that
were causing ``high risk to the civilian population, without us at
any time having intended to harm innocent civilians.''
   According to human rights organizations, most of the more than
70,000 people killed in El Salvador's civil war have been civilians.

<HEAD>Kathleen Sullivan Says She Faces CBS Ax if Ratings Don't Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RETRANSMTTING a0720 to restore logo.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unusually frank comment Monday, ``CBS This
Morning'' co-anchor Kathleen Sullivan said ``my days are numbered''
at the program if its ratings, now third among network morning
shows, don't improve.
   Sullivan spoke while on the syndicated ``Donahue'' show with her
two female competitors on network morning programs, Joan Lunden of
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and Jane Pauley, who is leaving
``Today'' at the end of this year.
   ``I can't lie about that _ I know the ax is right there,''
Sullivan said when asked by host Phil Donahue if she was feeling
the pressure of being on a program that is third in the ratings.
   The CBS News program, which Sullivan co-anchors with Harry
Smith, premiered on Nov. 30, 1987. It succeeded a short-lived,
low-rated entertainment show, and was the latest in CBS' long
effort to compete in the morning.
   Although Sullivan said her program's ratings have risen 50 per
cent since it began, she also said that if more viewers don't watch
``and we don't improve from where we are (in ratings), my days are
numbered.
   ``And I don't think there's a question about that. That's the
business. I know that. I'm a grownup.''
   Sullivan, who joined CBS from ABC, didn't elaborate. There was
no immediate comment from CBS.
   During Monday's show Pauley _ who last Friday told her national
``Today'' audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be
succeeded by news anchor Deborah Norville _ reiterated that it was
her decision to leave.
   However, she said in response to a viewer's question, she
wouldn't be leaving as soon as she is had not Norville, whom she
has called a friend, been hired for the program. Norville became
its news anchor on Sept.5.
   ``No, I would not be leaving at this time because the shift in
attitude would have come along much more slowly,'' she said,
referring to her own attitude about leaving the top-rated program.
   ``It took some kind of an external jolt, if you will, to propel
me out of a course I had very happily travelled for 13 years,'' she
said.
   Pauley, whose current NBC News contract has been extended to
1992, will co-anchor a prime time news series that will premiere in
late June or early July. She also will anchor a prime-time special
called ``Changes'' in March.

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Surround Key Town, Rockets Close Kabul Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel rocketing closed Kabul's
international airport Monday for the second time in three days. The
government acknowledged that U.S.-backed guerrillas surround Khost,
a strategic town near the Pakistan border.
   Other rocket attacks around Kabul wounded five people, the
government said.
   A government source and two witnesses said rebels captured Sore
Kalli, the hometown of Afghanistan's first Marxist ruler, Noor
Mohammad Taraki.
   The guerrillas also maintained their 10-day blockade of Kabul's
four major highways, causing food and fuel prices to rise.
   Military officers of the Soviet-backed government fear the
fractious rebel front has begun to unite, a government source said,
quoting military officials.
   Lack of unity hurt the rebels in their attempt to oust the Kabul
government after Soviet forces withdrew from their decade-long
military intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet withdrawal was
completed last February.
   The source, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
said Moslem rebels loyal to moderate Ahmad Shah Massoud and others
led by fundamentalist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar were coordinating the
10-day blockade of Salang Highway, the northern route out of Kabul.
   Diplomats quoted government officials as saying Massoud's men
and the government were negotiating. Massoud was said to be
offering to open the road in exchange for food.
   Several united guerrillas forces reportedly were fighting
government troops around Khost, 25 miles from the Pakistan border.
   Government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said rebels were
shelling Kabul from all sides.
   Government sources and diplomats have reported that a
Khost-bound convoy carrying weapons and food turned back toward
Kabul after fierce fighting outside of Gardez, which lies between
Khost and Kabul.
   Khost has relied on air shipments since January 1988.
   Soldiers at Kabul's airport reported it was closed after being
hit by at least 12 rockets.
   They said air shipments from the Soviet Union had dwindled to
about 10 a day from about 30.
   In Kabul, the prices for flour, mutton and rice continued to go
up and sugar could not be found.
   More than 2,000 trucks carrying suppies for Kabul were said to
be blocked on the highway. Private truckers entering Kabul from
other roads said those routes, too, were closed to government
traffic.
   Government officials have estimated that Kabul's food and fuel
stocks would last about a month if land and air routes were cut.
Silos holding 50,000 tons of flour were said to be full and the
government has also stockpiled gasoline.
   But most of the flour would go to government employees and their
families, comprising about 800,000 of Kabul's estimated 2.2 million
people.
   A goverment source said rebels seized Sore Kalli, the hometown
of Taraki, founder of the Democratic People's Party of Afghanistan.
   Last week thousands of rebels attacked the city in Ghazni
province south of Kabul. A government source and two truck drivers
who said they witnessed the battle reported that by Friday the
guerrillas had routed the 3,000-strong garrison.. The truck drivers
reported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded. They had no information
on government casualties.
   Taraki set up the garrison after he seized power in a coup in
April 1978. Althoug he was ousted and killed in another coup in
September 1979, the garrison remained one of the most powerful in
the province, the government source said.

<HEAD>Ninth Nuclear Test of Year Set For Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear weapon is scheduled to be detonated
Tuesday morning deep beneath the Nevada Test Site in a major test
that may be felt as far away Las Vegas, the Energy Department said
Monday.
   If weather conditions are favorable, the Energy Department plans
to set off the weapon at 7 a.m. PST.
   Scientists had planned to conduct the test Saturday, but it was
postponed because of winds blowing toward populated areas.
   The blast is to range from 20 to 150 kilotons, and may be felt
up to 105 miles away, according to DOE spokesman Jim Boyer. Las
Vegas is 105 miles southeast of the test site.
   Managers of high-rise buildings in the city were warned not to
have workers in precarious positions at the time of the detonation.
   The test will be the ninth of the year at the nation's nuclear
proving grounds, and the 696th announced blast since nuclear
testing began at the site in January 1951.
   The test is a weapons-related detonation to be conducted at the
bottom of a shaft 1,850 feet beneath the surface of Pahute Mesa.
Scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are
conducting the test.
   It is the first test since Sept. 14, when a smaller nuclear
weapon was detonated at the site.
   The DOE does not specify the expected yield of each detonation,
classifying them as either under 20 kilotons or between 20 and 150
kilotons.
   Only tests in the upper limits that are expected to produce
ground motion away from the site are announced in advance.

<TEXT>
   West Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall, who defied the
State Department by going to Beirut, said Monday he showed people
there America cares and gave a prominent Lebanese leader some
down-home political advice.
   Rahall and Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, who are of Lebanese descent,
returned Sunday from unsanctioned meetings with Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun, whose forces control east Beirut, and acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss in Moslem west Beirut.
   Both U.S. lawmakers described the two meetings as friendly and
respectful.
   Conversations with Aoun, who's pivotal in determining whether
Lebanon ratifies a new peace plan, also were frank, Rahall said in
an interview.
   ``We advised him that he ought to cool his anti-American
rhetoric,'' said Rahall, who predicted Aoun would become ``I think
more toned-down.''
   Rahall, who's been in Congress for 13 years, said he also passed
along to the military leader this political advice: ``Bite your
tongue and just hope that the follies of your enemies will catch up
with them.''
   In response, ``He said, `I hear you,''' Rahall recounted.
   The two Democrats' private diplomatic mission was not approved
by the State Department, which blocked an August attempt by Oakar
and Rahall to go to Beirut.
   Rahall defended the trip, saying the legislators did not engage
in amateur diplomacy or hostage negotiation.
   ``We weren't there as administration spokesmen,'' he said.
``There's never any good time, according to the State Department,
to visit that country.''
   Rahall said he and Oakar accomplished their primary goal. ``I
think we showed that despite the withdrawal of our ambassador the
U.S. is still committed to achieving peace in Lebanon,'' he said.
``That had, I think a very positive impact on the Lebanese people.''
   In an interview Sunday night and again Monday at a news
conference in her Cleveland district, Oakar said the trip was
within her rights and duties as a congresswoman.
   Oakar and Rahall visited Lebanon in 1982 at the height of the
fighting between Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese troops to condemn the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Rahall returned a year later and said
he intends to go back.

   Police arrested 169 youths on the first night of
a special curfew for a three-day campaign against Devil's Night
arson, a police spokesman said Monday.
   About 30,000 volunteers have pledged to help police patrol city
streets and ease the burden on firefighters, who in 1984 battled
808 fires during the three-day period before and including
Halloween.
   The number of fires has declined steadily every year since 1984.
Last year, there were 229 fires.
   Mayor Coleman A. Young's office refused to release the number of
arson fires until Wednesday, spokesman Robert Berg said Monday.
   Berg wouldn't say if any fires were set since Sunday night. But
he did say no arson-related arrests or fire-related injuries were
reported overnight.
   The special dusk-to-dawn curfew took effect at 6 p.m. Sunday and
ends at 6 a.m. Wednesday. The curfew allows police to arrest youths
17 and under who are not accompanied by an adult while outdoors.
   The 17-year-olds faced hearings Monday on the misdemeanor
charge, while those 16 and under were released either to the
custody of a parent or guardian or were held in the Wayne County
Youth Home, said police Sgt. Christopher Buck.
   Police arrested 302 curfew violators on the first night of the
1988 Devil's Night period, which was a Saturday. Buck said the
number declined this year because outdoor activity generally is
slower on a Sunday.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
expressed concern Monday that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
may try to use alleged attacks by the Nicaraguan Contras as an
excuse to scuttle elections set for next February.
   ``I worry that they (the Sandinistas) may be trying to lay a
predicate to walk away from their commitment to hold elections,''
Baker said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   However, Ortega on Monday said that the elections would be held
as planned, regardless of the resolution of the dispute over the
Contras.
   ``The elections are taking place in Nicaragua, period,'' Ortega
said, speaking through an interpreter in an interview with NBC
News. ``With Contra or without Contra they are going to take place,
definitely. With war or no war, that is, elections are taking
place.''
   Ortega has said that, under certain conditions, he may not renew
a cease-fire that the Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to in
March 1988. Ortega has contended that the rebels have
systematically violated the agreement.
   Baker said Ortega may be worried that opposition candidate
Violeta Chamorro could have a ``real chance of winning if the
elections are halfway free and fair.''
   ``If there is a chance for democracy to win an election, maybe
the approach hasn't been all wrong,'' Baker said, answering
skeptics who contend the administration has not applied enough
pressure on Nicaragua.
   The administration was ``waiting and watching'' to see if Ortega
will call off a 19-month truce with U.S.-backed rebels.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Ortega was a
target of mounting pressure from his Latin American neighbors not
to follow through on his threat.
   ``The issue pretty much goes back to President Ortega and the
Sandinistas in the sense of he's changed his position a little
bit,'' Fitzwater said. ``We, obviously, are urging that the
cease-fire be maintained.''
   After startling a hemispheric conference on democracy in Costa
Rica by announcing Friday that he would cancel the cease-fire,
Ortega modified his position to say he would decide the matter
Tuesday.
   A senior State Department official, briefing reporters on the
condition of anonymity, agreed with Baker that a decision by Ortega
to abrogate the cease-fire would be merely ``a pretext to end the
election process.'' Recent polls show Ortega to be trailing the
U.S.-backed presidential candidate, Violeta Chamorro, in
campaigning for next February's elections.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., called Ortega's threat
``regrettable. I hope it will be reconsidered.''
   ``By all reports, both Nicaragua and Ortega are suffering...
(because of) a blunder on his part,'' Foley said.
   For his part, Bush said at least four Latin American presidents
had chastised Ortega and that Costa Rican President Oscar Arias,
who won a Nobel Prize for his efforts to bring peace to the region,
was ``furious.''
   Chatting with several reporters he invited for a mid-day jog,
Bush said he had been misunderstood in calling Ortega a little man,
and that he had meant to say small-minded. He conceded that the
Nicaraguan leader, who is five-foot-ten, is not small of stature.
   Bush said he would not speculate on whether he might seek
renewed military aid for the Contras if Ortega carries through on
his threat.
   His spokesman, Fitzwater, said: ``Our purpose is still to get a
free and fair election and to pursue the peace process.''
   Administration officials privately said a request for military
aid was extremely unlikely _ given strong bipartisan congressional
opposition to rearming the Contras.
   Under an agreement reached last spring between the White House
and Congress, humanitarian aid is to be continued to the Contras
through the Feb. 25 elections in Nicaragua.
   Congressional leaders have vowed to adhere to that agreement _
which also envisions the disbanding of the rebel group once free
and fair elections have been assured.
   ``We have an agreement with the administration,'' Foley said on
Monday.
   With Ortega to announce on Tuesday whether he will continue the
cease-fire, ``it's pretty much a case of waiting and watching to
see what he does and to make sure that our views are clear,''
Fitzwater said.
   He also said U.S. officials ``do not buy for one minute''
Ortega's rationale for threatening to end the truce _ violations of
the cease-fire by the Contras.
   Fitzwater said that Sandinista violations, including breaking a
treaty banning shipping arms to leftist rebels in El Salvador,
``dwarf any violations by the Contras.''
   The State Department official said that ``Latin leaders were
shocked and disappointed'' by Ortega's behavior at the Costa Rica.
   ``I would note that this (Contras) is an army without
ammunition, by and large. They have not received any U.S. military
supplies since February 1988, while the Sandinista is a
well-equipped, well-supplied military force,'' the official
said.``So, the idea that the resistance would routinely attack the
Sandinista army is an unlikely event.''

   An American Airlines 727 with 105 people

on Monday night after air turbulence injured five people, officials
said.
   The non-stop flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Detroit
landed safely around 6:30 p.m., American spokesman Al Becker said
from the airline's Dallas headquarters.
   ``Apparently, it experienced turbulance about 90 miles north of
Nassau in the Bahamas, at about 31,000 feet,'' he said.
   Four of the five injuries were minor, Becker said. A flight

   The Boeing 727 was carrying 98 passengers and a seven-member
crew, Becker said.
   Althought there were no reports of damage to the plane, Becker
said inspectors would check the aircraft.

   A 23-year-old Palestinian was sentenced Monday
to 16 life terms in prison for killing 16 people, including an
American and two Canadians, when he forced a crowded passenger bus
off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway.
   The attack July 6 was the bloodiest in the 22-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
the sentence imposed on Abdel Hadi Ghanem was one of the stiffest
in Israel's history.
   Also Monday, newspapers said the army will soon begin using
observation balloons equipped with cameras to keep track of
protests and disturbances related to the uprising.
   A Canadian TV correspondent was slightly wounded and a
14-year-old Palestinian boy was critically injured when soldiers
opened fire on stone throwers in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.
   Also in Gaza, soldiers searched the office of Arab journalist
Taher Sharita, said to do work for The New York Times and Reuters
news agency, and removed documents they deemed suspicious, military
officials said.
   They said the documents would be returned if found to be
non-inflammatory.
   A Palestinian refugee died Monday of a gunshot wound suffered
five days earlier in the Farah refugee camp in the West Bank, the
army said.
   He was identified as Hussein Mohammad Hassani, 24, and the army
said he was about to throw a cement block at soldiers when shot.
   Thirteen Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers in
the occupied lands on Monday, including the boy shot in Gaza and
two Arabs shot in the Farah camp in protests that broke out after
Hassani's death was reported, Arab hospital officials said.
   Hassani's death raised to 607 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israelis in the Palestinian revolt, which began in December 1987.
   An additional 137 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most as suspected collaborators with Israel. Forty Israelis have
died.
   Ghanem was sentenced to life in prison for each of the deaths in
the bus attack. He also received 20 years for each of the 24
passengers wounded in the attack.
   The sentences are to be served concurrently.
   Chief Prosecutor Uzi Hasson said there was no parole for murder
sentences and Ghanem could be freed only if the president
intervened on his behalf.
   The victims included the only American to be killed in the
uprising, lawyer Rita Levine, 39, of Philadelphia. Two victims were
Canadian tourists, Fern Rykiss, 17, of Winnepeg, and Shelley
Halpenny, 32, of Vancouver.
   Ghanem, who was injured in the incident, said he carried out the
attack to avenge a friend wounded by soldiers and paralyzed in a
clash near his home in the Gaza Strip's Nusseirat refugee camp.
   The attack prompted several days of revenge attacks by Jews on
Arabs in Jerusalem and other cities.
   The Canadian correspondent wounded in Shabura refugee camp in
Gaza was identified as Jean Francois Lepine of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. He was hit with a rubber bullet in the leg,
colleagues and the army command said.
   An army spokesman said an officer fired at the legs of
Palestinian rioters, hitting Lepine.
   ``The journalist was standing among the rioters ... and was not
identified by the officer before the shooting was carried out. He
was bandaged by troops and taken to a U.N. clinic,'' the spokesman
said.
   Lepine received stitches at a United Nations clinic and was
taken to a local hospital for X-rays ``as a precaution,'' said a
CBC producer who asked that his name not be used.
   Lepine was at least the third journalist wounded since the
uprising began.
   In the same incident, a Palestinian boy was hit in the head with
a plastic bullet fired by the troops, Arab reports said. Ashraf
Kishda was taken to Soroka Hospital in Israel, the reports said.

   Disputing the existence of serious differences
among key officials, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Monday the Bush administration is trying to seize ``what we think
is an opportunity'' for significant reform in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Baker said ``there
are only nuances of differences'' over whether Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev can succeed in his program of transforming the
country politically and economically.
   Calling that a question of ``durability,'' Baker said ``I don't
think there is any policy difference in the administration on the
question of the desirability'' of the Soviet leader's perestroika
policy.
   Baker's comments were designed to put to rest the notion that
differences among top officials were slowing a U.S. response to
Gorbachev's bold approaches, particularly in Eastern Europe.
   Just last week, Baker acted to quash a speech by Robert M.
Gates, the deputy national security adviser, that took a
pessimistic view of Gorbachev's chances after Baker in two speeches
had set forth the administration's position welcoming the changes
in the Soviet Union. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has voiced
reservations similar to those in Gates' speech.
   On the other hand, Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell of
Maine has accused the administration of being timid in response to
Soviet initiatives.
   ``We've made up our mind,'' Baker said, ``that there is an
opportunity there we should try and seize; that it would be a
mistake (not to try) regardless of what we think about his
(Gorbachev's) chances of success. And quite clearly he faces some
very major problems.''
   But, Baker said, ``we ought to talk about that in the right way
and at the right time.''
   On another subject, Baker said he did not expect ``definitive
answers'' on prospects for Mideast negotiations during an eight-day
trip to Australia beginning Tuesday night.
   Baker will meet with Prime Minister Bob Hawke and attend a
12-nation planning session for a new economic grouping among Asian
nations.
   ``We may continue to talk even while I am on the trip,'' Baker
said. ``But I would guide you off looking for either a
make-or-break on this thing before the trip is over.''
   Baker has been conducting much of his Middle East diplomacy by
telephone with Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmat
Abdel Meguid of Egypt. His goal is to set up a meeting between
Israelis and Palestinians leading to elections on the West Bank and
in Gaza.
   ``I have not put any deadline on this and we will continue to
try and work (on) the problem,'' Baker said.
   Turning to Nicaragua during a 20-minute session in his seventh
floor office in the State Department, Baker reaffirmed his view
that President Daniel Ortega may be using reported attacks by
Contra insurgents as an excuse to try to scuttle elections set for
next February.
   Ortega has said that, under certain conditions, he may not renew
a cease-fire that the Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to in
March 1988. Ortega has contended that the rebels have
systematically violated the agreement.
   ``I worry that they (the Sandinistas) may be trying to lay a
predicate to walk away (justify a walking away) from their
commitment to hold elections,'' Baker said.
   But Ortega for his part insisted in an interview with NBC
television that he was not walking away from the elections.
   ``The elections are taking place in Nicaragua, period,'' Ortega
said.
   Ortega may be worried that opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro
could have a ``real chance of winning if the elections are halfway
free and fair,'' Baker said.
   ``If there is a chance for democracy to win an election, maybe
the approach hasn't been all wrong,'' he concluded.

   The New York Times will pay about $3.6 million
over six years to settle lawsuits brought by independent
home-delivery dealers who wanted to block a delivery service
offered by the newspaper, the Times announced Monday.
   Under the settlement, the Times will continue to run its own
delivery service in exchange for the $3.6 million paid to the
dealers, along with other payments in the form of subsidies over
three years, the newspaper said in a statement.
   The dealers first sued in 1982 when the Times began its own
competing direct delivery service.
   Two antitrust lawsuits were dismissed in U.S. District Court,
and the decisions were affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The remaining lawsuits, including various contract claims, were
dismissed as part of Monday's settlement, the Times said.

   A homeless man with a history of mental problems
was convicted Monday of raping and murdering a pregnant doctor in
her hospital office.
   Steven Smith, 23, had admitted killing Dr. Kathryn Hinnant at
Bellevue Hospital last Jan. 7. But his lawyer said he was insane
and therefore not responsible for the crimes.
   The jury, however, accepted a prosecutor's assertion that Smith
was aware of his actions and that his insanity defense was a ruse
to escape punishment. The jury deliberated for only two hours.
   The Manhattan jury convicted Smith of all counts he faced:
murder, rape, robbery and sodomy. Smith, who faces a maximum of 50
years to life in prison, showed no emotion.
   State Supreme Court Justice James Leff set sentencing for Nov.
21. Supreme Court is the name of the regular trial court in New
York.
   The defendant's mother, Marian Smith, said, ``He didn't have a
ghost of a chance with the ghosts in that courtroom.''
   Hinnant, 33, was five months pregnant when she was attacked in
her fourth-floor office-laboratory at the massive 1,200-bed
hospital. Her husband, Eric Johnson, and a hospital administrator
found her body the next day.
   According to trial testimony, Smith told police he sometimes
slept in a storeroom on the hospital's 22nd floor and walked around
unnoticed in surgical garb and carrying a stethoscope. He claimed
he watched operations, slept in the doctor's quarters and visited
patients' roomms.
   Smith's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, argued that Smith deliberately
left clues at the scene so police could find and hospitalize him.
   As proof of Smith's insanity, Kornberg cited medical records
dating back to when his client was 14. Almost all of them say Smith
has low intelligence and is delusional, that he hallucinates and
hears voices.
   A psychiatrist who testified for the defense said Smith appeared
to have a psychosis related to schizophrenia.
   Smith initially told police he had an accomplice named ``John.''
Kornberg said John was a delusion, that the defendant really
thought this person had punched and raped Hinnant and then helped
him kill her.
   ``The man is mentally sick,'' Kornberg told jurors. ``The man is
not criminally responsible for what he does.''
   But Assistant District Attorney James Kindler argued that Smith
is sane. ``He was aware of what murder was, and he was aware that
Kathryn Hinnant was murdered,'' Kindler said. ``So why is insanity
a defense?''
   Kindler said Smith invented stories about hearing voices,
compulsive behavior and ``John'' because he was trying to escape
responsibility for what he did. As for fingerprints and other clues
at the scene, Kindler said, they show Smith was sloppy, careless
and unlucky, but they don't show that he was crazy.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, her government
rocked by the resignation of her top treasury official, sank Monday
to the worst ratings of her decade in power.
   One sounding showed her the most unpopular leader since polling
began here.
   ``She cannot afford many more mishaps,'' said Norman Tebbit,
former chairman of the governing Conservative Party, who helped
mastermind Mrs. Thatcher's third successive election victory in
1987.
   In a National Opinion Poll sounding, Mrs. Thatcher hit the
lowest popularity rating for any prime minister since polling
started in Britain 50 years ago.
   Only 24 percent of a sample of 935 voters questioned said they
were satisfied with her performance and 61 percent blamed her for
Thursday's sudden resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson.
   He said he could not continue in the 22-member Cabinet so long
as Mrs. Thatcher retained a personal economic adviser, Sir Alan
Walters, who opposes Britain joining fully the European Monetary
System which links key European currencies. Walters then also
resigned.
   Mrs. Thatcher is lukewarm toward membership of the system's
currency-stabilizing exchange rate mechanism, while both Lawson and
the deputy prime minister Sir Geoffrey Howe favor it. She fired
Howe as foreign secretary last June.
   Tebbit, one of Mrs. Thatcher's closest political associates,
described the latest forced Cabinet shuffle as ``an appalling
political muddle.'
   ``She should remember it is dangerous for a captain to appear
semi-detached from the team,'' Tebitt wrote in London's Evening
Standard.
   The furor has heightened criticisms of Mrs. Thatcher's style as
bossy, hectoring and intolerant of opposing views in the Cabinet.
   Britain's new foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Monday that
some Cabinet ministers ``shrivel up'' before Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``She likes an argument,'' Hurd said in a television interview.
``Some people find it difficult to argue with a woman prime
minister, so they rather tend to shrivel up and feel resentful.
   ``The answer is actually to argue back,'' the former Home
Secretary said. ``You'll find yourself being contradicted and
sometimes told you don't know what you are talking about. But if
you persevere ... you gain ground.''
   The National Opinion Poll, published in a London newspaper, The
Independent, was taken by telephone in the three days after Lawson
quit and the British media reported the government in crisis.
   Mrs. Thatcher already held the unpopularity record when she
scored a 25 percent satisfied rating in Gallup and Market Opinion
and Research International polls in 1981 when the effects of her
tight-money policies sent unemployment soaring.
   Labor Party Prime Minister Harold Wilson held the previous
unpopularity record of 27 percent satisfied in a 1968 Gallup
sounding.
   The National Opinion Poll, which gave no margin of error, showed
62 percent of those questioned said they were dissatisfied with
Mrs. Thatcher. Fourteen percent had no opinion.
   A Harris Poll, for the BBC-TV current affairs program,
``Panorama'' being screened Monday night, showed the Conservatives
13 points behind the socialist Labor Party. Fifty-two percent of
those questioned said Mrs. Thatcher should resign now.
   Mrs. Thatcher, meanwhile, called senior leaders of her troubled
party to discuss strategy at her No. 10 Downing St. residence.
   Party chairman Kenneth Baker acknowledged afterward, ``The
government has appeared from time to time to be disunited.''
   The Harris poll, taken over the weekend among 925 voters, gave
Labor 50 percent of the vote, enough for a landslide election
victory, and the Conservatives 37 percent. The rest split among two
small centrist parties and the Greens.
   In an ominous sign for Mrs. Thatcher who had been credited
relatively widely with pulling the British economy around, 61
percent said the government was handling the economy badly.
Sixty-seven percent said they had little or no confidence in her
handling of the government.
   Since the furor over Lawson's resignation, the Conservatives
have slumped to an average 10 points behind Labor in polls,
compared with around 7 points behind during the previous month.
   The Conservatives have trailed Labor consistently since early
summer.

   A Navy pilot making his first landing
attempt on an aircraft carrier was ``low and slow'' before his
training jet crashed on the USS Lexington, killing him and four
others, the ship's captain said Monday.
   The T-2 Buckeye slammed into the ship's island, the tower-like
part of the ship which also was hit by a kamikaze plane in World
War II, before cartwheeling across the deck and exploding in flames
Sunday afternoon, said Capt. C. Flack Logan.
   ``It looked like a battle zone. There were pieces of aircraft
and of metal all over the place. Bodies were spread throughout
different areas,'' Lt. Bruce Adams, a physician and the ship's
medical officer, said after the Lexington returned to its dock late
Monday morning.
   In addition to the five dead, 19 people were injured, Logan said.
   The pilot, Ensign Steven E. Pontell, 23, of Columbia, Md., was
the only one aboard the two-seat trainer, a normal situation when
aviators make their first carrier landings, Logan said. Pontell, a
1988 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., was a
member of Training Squadron 19 at Meridian, Miss., Naval Air
Station.
   The Navy identified the other dead as Petty Officer 3rd Class
Burnett Kilgore Jr., 19, of Holly Springs, Miss.; Petty Officer 3rd
Class Timmy L. Garroutte, 30, of Memphis, Tenn.; and Airman Lisa L.
Mayo, 25, of Oklahoma City, all Lexington crew members; and Byron
Gervis Courvelle, 32, of Meridian, Miss., a civilian employee of
DynCorp which has a contract to maintain Navy aircraft. The four
were on the flight deck, officials said.
   In another accident involving a Navy vessel, a U.S. warplane
accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided-missile crusier
USS Reeves during maneuvers Monday in the Indian Ocean. The bomb
left a 5-foot hole in the ship's main deck and five sailors were
slightly injured, the Navy said.
   The Lexington was steaming in the Gulf of Mexico in clear
weather about 30 miles south of its home port here when the jet
crashed.
   ``As I see it,'' Logan said, ``he ended up in a position which
in naval aviation is known as being low and slow, which is a very
terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a ship.''
   Landing signal officers radioed the pilot to add power and waved
him off, but he did not comply, Logan said. He said an
investigation would try to explain why.
   ``The nose pitched up, and he lost control of his ability to fly
the aircraft, and it went up and came into the island,'' the
captain said.
   The plane flipped upside down before a wing tip hit the island
just below the control tower, the captain said. The wing tip broke
off and remained embedded in the superstructure when the Lexington
docked Monday.
   The jet's fuselage then smashed into the side of the island, but
the ship showed little evidence of the accident other than the
wreckage of the plane, still upside down, covered with orange and
white parachutes.
   It hit at the feet of Airman Dee Votolato, 21, of Houma, La.,
who was inside a glassed-in area operating a video camera used to
tape all landings.
   The Lexington is the Navy's oldest carrier, its only one used
exclusively for training and the only one with women aboard.
   The impact knocked Votolato to the floor, but she got back up
and pointed her camera at the flight deck in time to capture the
plane bursting into flames.
   Airman Darrell Gurley of Indianapolis was directing crew members
on the deck where to park planes as they landed.
   ``He was headed straight for us,'' Gurley said. ``I turned and
there was just a great boom. It shook me and I buckled down, but I
knew I had to get out the door because the flames were coming right
for my station. I knew I would be wiped out so I took off running.''
   Gurley, his arm in a sling, said a piece of metal had hit him in
the back. He made it inside the island only to discover his shirt
was on fire. He took it off, put out the flames, put it back on and
joined firefighting efforts.
   Pieces of the plane struck three other parked jets, but Logan
said it appeared all three can be repaired.
   Pilots in the other three planes jettisoned their canopies and
clambered out, Logan said.
   Airplanes normally land on the Lexington's 910-foot, blacktop
flight deck at about 110 to 120 knots, or up to 138 mph, said Cmdr.
Denny Major, the ship's air officer. They stop by catching their
tailhooks on cables stretched across the 192-foot-wide deck.
Aircraft land on the stern of the ship.
   The crash occurred six days before the 45th anniversary of the
kamikaze attack that killed 47 crew members and injured 127 on Nov.
4, 1944.

   Entertainer Bette Midler should get $400,000
from an advertising agency that imitated the Grammy-winning
singer's voice in a TV commercial, a federal jury ruled Monday.
   The U.S. District Court jury, which began deliberating Friday,
decided that Young &amp; Rubicam violated Miss Midler's rights by
imitating her voice.
   In a statement given reporters, the agency called the award
``unfortunate but bearable.''
   ``I hope my victory will in a small way contribute to higher
ethical standards in the advertising field,'' Miss Midler said in a
statement. ``I also hope it will cause companies to pause before
they knowingly and willfully trod on the property rights of
others.''
   The actress and singer said she was considering appealing a
court ruling that barred the jury from awarding punitive damages
because Young &amp; Rubicam had a good-faith belief it was acting
within the law.
   At the trial, Miss Midler testified, ``I don't do commercials,''
and said one of her former backup singers was hired to perform the
song ``Do You Wanna Dance?'' for a 1986 Mercury Sable car
commercial after she turned down a request from Ford Motor Co.
   Miss Midler, who has appeared in such films as ``Beaches'' and
``Outrageous Fortune,'' filed the lawsuit against Young &amp; Rubicam
Inc. in 1987 seeking $2.5 million in damages.
   Miss Midler also filed a $10 million lawsuit against Ford, but
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima ruled Thursday there was
insufficient evidence to proceed against the car company.
   Miss Midler's attorney, Peter Laird, said he hoped ``national
advertisers and advertising agencies will think twice in the future
before they disregard the rights of artists.''
   Laird told the jury his client never agreed to sing in the
commercial, and she never would have. The agency ``took what they
couldn't buy from Midler,'' he said.
   ``She had the right to say no. That right was taken away from
her,'' Laird said.
   Defense attorney Robert Callagy claimed Young &amp; Rubicam never
intended to imitate Miss Midler's voice, but instead ``tried to do
credible renditions of the original recording of her 1971 hit song.
He said the agency bought a license to use the song.
   ``The mere imitations of a performance is not a violation of
copyright law. We imitated the record; we did not imitate the
voice,'' said Callagy.
   Two years ago, a judge threw out Miss Midler's case, ruling the
agency acted like ``the average thief'' but had broken no laws. An
appeals court overturned that decision.
   Prior to the start of deliberations, Tashima instructed jurors,
``When a professional singer's voice is widely known and is
deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the singer's
rights have been violated.''

<HEAD>Pedro Vargas, Tenor of the Americas, Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican singer Pedro Vargas, nicknamed ``the
tenor of the Americas,'' died early Monday of heart failure, his
family said. He was 85.
   ``He died in his sleep,'' his oldest son, Pedro Vargas Jr., told
reporters. Vargas had been suffering for several years from
diabetes and heart problems.
   Known for his rich melodious voice, Vargas' singing career
spanned more than 60 years and included performances at Carnegie
Hall, Madison Square Garden and the White House.
   He sang for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S.
Truman, shared the stage with Sammy Davis Jr., and counted Frank
Sinatra and Julio Iglesias among his friends and admirers.
   Vargas was considered one of the brightest starts in the
``Golden Age'' of Mexican music, which spanned the 1930s and '40s.
   Vargas, in partnership with composer Mexican Agustin Lara,
popularized the ``bolero'' and the ``paso doble,'' the fast-paced
Spanish double footstep dance. He also appeared in dozens of films,
most of them produced in Mexico.
   It was considered one of the greatest musical partnerships in
the Spanish-speaking world.
   Vargas was born in San Miguel de Allende, in central Mexico, on
April 29, 1904, the second of 13 children. He was a quiet and
introverted child whose family wanted him to become a priest.
   Instead, he developed an early vocation for music and began
singing in a chorus in high school in Mexico City in 1917. After
high school, he tried to become a bullfighter but failed, and
turned to studying medicine.
   But singing remained his first love and his strong tenor voice
gained him quick admission to the National Conservatory of Music.
   Vargas got his first break in 1928 when he was selected to sing
the role of Turidu in the Italian opera Cavalleria Rusticana by
Pedro Mascagani. The performance was so successful that it led to a
tour of the United States.
   Vargas then turned to popular ballads, eventually reaching an
audience of millions in Latin America, the United States, Europe
and Asia. His rendition of ``Fleur-de-Lis'' was his hallmark
throughout Latin America in the 1930s.
   ``He was a personal friend of Frank Sinatra and, although they
never sang together, he did sing with a mutual friend, Sammy Davis,
Jr.,'' his son recalled Monday.
   ``This morning, I received with great emotion condolences from
my father's death from Frank Sinatra, Julio Iglesias and Libertad
Lamarque, among others,'' Pedro Vargas Jr. said.
   Vargas is survived by his wife Teresa Campos, four children and
seven grandchildren.

<HEAD>Security Council Finds Consensus on Namibia Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Council ambassadors agreed Monday
on a mild resolution that criticizes South Africa's administration
in Namibia but does not claim that free and fair elections are
impossible in the territory.
   Unanimous adoption was likely Tuesday after the 15 ambassadors
consult their capitals, said Western and Third World diplomats on
the council, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Black African and non-aligned nations began circulating draft
resolutions two weeks ago that castigated South Africa for alleged
abuses, and prepared to follow up with strong speeches before the
Nov. 7-11 Namibian election.
   British diplomats said those resolutions invited vetoes from
more than one of the five permanent Security Council members _ the
United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union.
   Western diplomats said Third World nations were trying to mount
an 11th-hour campaign to boost the electoral chances of the
South-West Africa People's Organization, known as SWAPO.
   Intense consultations resulted in language agreeable to all
council members.
   ``This is a watered-down version that causes us no problems,''
said Aubrey Dwyer, spokesman for South Africa, which is not on the
council. ``There's nothing in there that they can use to declare
the elections null and void.''
   The final draft ``welcomes'' Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar's report on Namibia, which outlined areas of concern but
concluded that the territory is headed for a free and fair election.
   It ``demands immediate, full and strict compliance by all
parties concerned, in particular South Africa,'' in implementing
council resolutions calling for Namibia's independence.
   It demands that all paramilitary and ethnic forces and commando
units be disbanded, particularly the South-West Africa Territorial
Force and Koevoet, a dreaded counterinsurgency unit.
   SWAPO has accused its main competitor, the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, of hiring Koevoet veterans to intimidate pro-SWAPO voters
and break up campaign rallies.
   The resolution calls for decommissioning the 1,500 South African
Defense Force soldiers still in Namibia, now confined to base under
U.,N. supervision.
   It demands repeal of ``such remaining restrictive and
discriminatory laws and regulations as inhibit the holding of free
and fair elections,'' without specifying any.
   The resolution endorses Perez de Cuellar's opinion that law AG8,
which establishes a racially segregated society in Namibia, should
be repealed.
   Namibians will vote for a constituent assembly to draft a
constitution and organize the first independent, black
majority-ruled government in the territory of 1.3 million.
   If SWAPO wins two-thirds of the votes, it will be able to
unilaterally write the constitution and organize any form of
government it chooses.
   The former German colony has been governed by South Africa since
1915.
   Last December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba
agreeing to cooperate with a U.N. plan for Namibia's transition to
independence as Cuba withdraws its 50,000 troops from Angola.

<TEXT>
   Three railway lines in Northern
Ireland were closed Monday night by bomb warnings, one day after
Protestants and Roman Catholics traveled together to defy IRA
disruption of cross-border trains.
   Anonymous telephoned warnings of bombs on the lines closed the
cross-border service between Newry in the north and Dundalk in the
Irish Republic. Separate warnings shut down services in the north
between Belfast and Bangor and Belfast and Larne.
   Police said they would not inspect the tracks until daylight
because they fered possible ambushes and booby traps.
   The closures meant disruption Tuesday morning for thousands of
Belfast-bound commuters.
   Hundreds of people traveled on ``peace trains'' last weekend to
protest bombings and bomb threats by the outlawed Irish Republican
Army, which has halted the cross-border route more than 60 times
this year in its fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
   Seven explosions ripped through an
oil-field service company Monday, injuring two workers, damaging 25
mobile homes and forcing the evacuation of about 200 people,
authorities said.
   ``It was just like mortar rounds shot out in all directions,''
Police Chief Dean Akings said in this city of about 17,000 people
112 miles northwest of Wichita.
   The explosions and fire at Wire Tech Service Inc. on the eastern
edge of the city began at 7:50 a.m., and were caused by shaped
charges, which are explosives used in the oil industry, officials
said.
   A search for live charges and blasting caps was under way Monday
night.
   ``There was over 1,000 of those projectiles inside the
business,'' Akings said. ``They all went somewhere. We've had some
of those projectiles located up to three-quarters of a mile away.''
   The city police and fire departments, the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and an Army bomb squad from Fort
Riley took part in the search. Residents were warned to call
authorities if they spotted any charges, which can be set off by
high heat or pressure.
   The first explosion was followed by six more blasts and a fire
at the company. Firefighters standing outside the building put the
blaze out within about 20 minutes, said Fire Chief Dick Meisinger.
   ``I wasn't going to send people in,'' Meisinger said, citing the
danger of another explosion.
   About 200 residents within a quarter-mile of Wire Tech Service
were evacuated, Akings said. Everyone except the residents of the
25 mobile homes damaged by the explosions had returned to their
homes by late Monday.
   The two workers injured were inside the building when the
explosions erupted.
   Brent Curtis, 27, suffered cuts and was in stable condition at
the Central Kansas Medical Center, said Nursing Supervisor Mary
Doherty. George Reed, 35, was treated and released.
   At least four or five vehicles parked in front of a machine shop
across the street from Wire Tech were heavily damaged, said Joyce
Lindholm, who works at the shop.
   Wire Tech provides service to established oil wells, and does
not manufacture explosives.
   Dorothy Juergensen, who lives near the plant, said she was
leaving her house when the first blast occurred.
   ``I was heading out the door when it hit. We waited for
everything to quit flying around,'' she said. ``... It shook
everything and everybody.''

<HEAD>Hungarian TV Broadcasts Czech Dissident Havel's Critical Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State TV showed extensive film on
Monday of police beating demonstrators with clubs in Prague and
broadcast an interview with top dissident Vaclav Havel raking
Czechoslovakia's hard-line communist leadership.
   ``Society is slowly waking'' in protest against repression,
banned playwright Havel told the Panorama public affairs show.
   His comments were part of a 20-minute segment dealing with
demonstrations on the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak
independence. More than 10,000 people defied a police ban and
rallied for democracy in Prague last Saturday, despite hundreds of
arrests and beatings by riot police.
   Havel was interviewed in a hospital on Friday. He has been there
for treatment of a bronchial inflammation since shortly after his
arrest Thursday, two days before mass protests broke out.
   Alluding to promises of change in East Germany, forced by mass
demonstrations, and to reforms in Hungary and Poland, Havel said,
``The (Czechoslovak) authorities are very nervous and are acting
accordingly.''
   ``The present Czechoslovak leadership is increasingly isolated
at home as well as abroad.''
   Formal alliance in the Warsaw Pact has been unable to paper over
increasing tensions between Czechoslovakia, one of the most
orthodox Soviet bloc countries, and Hungary, which is rapidly
evolving into a multiparty democracy.
   Political differences were heightened by Hungary's decision to
unilaterally declare a moratorium on its part of a Danube River dam
and canal project with Czechoslovakia. It says completion of the
project would cause irreversible ecological havoc.
   Czechoslovakia plans to finish construction of its part and
demands compensation from Hungary if it pulls out permanently.
   In a separate Panorama interview, movie director Jiri Menzel,
best-known abroad for his Oscar-winning film ``Closely Watched
Trains,'' described Czechoslovakia as split between ``those who
rule ... and those who obediently ... accept everything that
happens.''
   Panorama also showed an interview made months ago with
Czechoslovakia's former communist party leader, Alexander Dubcek,
whose 1968 political reforms were crushed by a Warsaw Pact invasion.
   ``You can write in the constitution that the (communist) party
is the leading power, but that doesn't mean anything by itself,''
Dubcek asserted.
   Dubcek, who has compared his attempts at reform with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies, urged the Czechoslovak
leadership to follow Moscow's example.
   Months before it disbanded and was replaced by the newly created
Socialist Party on Oct. 7, Hungary's communist party directly
criticized the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion _ the only Soviet bloc
communist party to do so.
   That move, along with a spate of newspaper articles and radio
and television programs siding with the 1968 reformers on occasion
of the Aug. 21 anniversary of the invasion, drew a formal
Czechoslovak protest.
   The National Federation of Hungarian Journalists on Monday
assailed the detention of a Hungarian reporter by Czechoslovak
police over the weekend and the ousting of other Hungarian
journalists trying to cover the Aug. 21 anniversary in Prague.
   In a statement carried by the official MTI news agency, the
federation urged Czechoslovak authorities to observe international
norms on human rights and on freedom of information. It also
scolded East Germany for recently expelling some Hungarian
reporters.

   A convict armed with a homemade knife held a
doctor and three workers hostage for five hours at a state prison
Monday, and surrendered after talking with the head of Illinois'
penal system, authorities said.
   The prisoner had demanded to see Corrections Department Director
Michael Lane, who flew to the maximum-security Stateville
Correctional Center from the state capital of Springfield.
   The doctor and three dental clinic workers were taken hostage
about 2 p.m. in the prison medical unit, said Corrections
Department spokesman Nic Howell. The hostages were released
unharmed about five hours later.
   The inmate, Mark A. LaRue, 35, had been transferred to Illinois
from Washington state in an exchange of troublemaking inmates, Lane
said. LaRue had asked for an airplane to return him to Washington,
Lane said.
   ``He's given me a letter that's articulated a number of things,
but principally, he doesn't want to be in Illinois,'' Lane said.
``I think that he does not want to be locked up.''
   Howell said Lane agreed to transfer the inmate to another prison.
   The prison was immediately placed on a lockdown status, with
inmates confined to their cells, Howell said.
   LaRue had an extensive record in Washington, including arrests
for burglary, assault and posession of a weapon by an inmate,
according to records in the Corrections Department.
   He had been serving a 10-year sentence for assault, said a
Washington Corrections Department spokeswoman. While in prison,
Larue was sentenced to three years for possession of a weapon and
then was sentenced to 20 years on two assault charges, she said.
   Lane said LaRue was transferred from the Washington state system
to federal prison because he was a troublemaker. He was in six
federal prisons before being sent to Illinois.
   Last summer, a guard was beaten to death at Stateville, which
has been plagued by overcrowding.
   The guard, Lawrence ``Frank'' Kush, 24, was one of about 30
workers at the prison who were on a hit list circulated within the
penitentiary earlier in the year, signed ``the Executioner.'' Kush
was known as an aggressive guard who led raids to confiscate drugs,
weapons and other contraband from convicts.
   In March, an inmate was stabbed to death at the prison.
   Stateville, built in 1920 to house 1,506 prisoners, had 2,070 as
of Friday, Howell said.
   Joliet is 30 miles southwest of Chicago.

<HEAD>Boeing Military Airplanes to Pay $11 Million to the Federal Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Boeing Co.'s military aircraft
division signed an agreement Monday requiring the company to pay
the federal government $11 million in connection with allegations
of overcharges on Air Force contracts, officials said.
   The signing by Boeing Military Airplanes President Robert L.
Dryden was announced by the U.S. attorney's office in Wichita and
the Justice Department in Washington.
   Boeing has denied any wrongdoing in the case, characterizing the
dispute as a good-faith disagreement over pricing procedures. In
the settlement, the company did not acknowledge the validity of the
government's claims.
   However, a document reportedly presented to federal grand jurors
contained a Boeing official's calculations of how much money would
be generated by the overcharges.
   Under the settlement, Boeing must pay the $11 million within
five days. The agreement says Boeing won't face civil or criminal
prosecution in the case, except possible Internal Revenue Service
claims.
   ``We're certainly pleased that an amicable settlement could be
reached,'' said company spokesman Richhard L. Ziegler.
   Ziegler refused to discuss the company's potential IRS liability
in the case or how the alleged overcharges occurred.
   The case involved contracts for new aluminum skins, or outer
coverings, on KC-135 refueling tankers and transports from 1974 to
1986. Government investigators alleged that Boeing overcharged for
aluminum raw materials by quoting supplier catalog prices instead
of their actual costs, which were 12 percent to 13 percent less.
During Air Force contract negotiations, Boeing is required to
certify the raw materials prices it quotes are current, accurate
and complete.
   An investigation into the case began in 1985.
   A federal grand jury in Wichita, where the division is based,
heard hundreds of hours of testimony, and inspected thousands of
documents for more than nine months before the case was withdrawn
by prosecutors late last month.
   In addition to the other terms of the settlement, the agreement
prohibits Boeing from charging any of its costs or legal fees in
the settlement to government accounts or on future government
contrcats.
   The divison's parent company is based in Seattle.

   A South Korean chemical tanker and a
Panamanian-registered container vessel collided off southwestern
Japan early Tuesday and nine South Korean crew members are missing,
Japan's coast guard said.
   An official of the Maritime Safety Agency's office at Kochi said
an agency patrol boat rescued four crew drifting in a rubber boat,
but Capt. Kim Dong-an of the 755-ton Inchon Pioneer and eight
others were missing.
   The official said the four men rescued were in good condition
and that the 16 crew aboard the 37,000-ton Ever Guide, all
Taiwanese, were unhurt.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The cause of the collision was not immediately known, he said.
   The Inchon Pioneer was bound from Yokohama to Oita, southwestern
Japan, with about 600 tons of alcohol-related products when the
collision with the Ever Guide occurred about 6 miles from Cape
Muroto, 390 miles southwest of Tokyo, the official said.
   He said the Ever Guide was sailing from Osaka to Taiwan.
   Six patrol boats and three aircraft are seaching for the missing
crew, he said.

   Prospective jurors in the trial of a Miami police
officer who shot a black motorcyclist to death were asked Monday
whether the threat of racial violence would influence their verdict.
   People were called into the courtroom one at a time from a jury
pool created last week and questioned closely by attorneys about
their knowledge of the Jan. 16 shooting that sparked three days of
rioting.
   The trial of Colombian-born William Lozano, 30, has raised
concern among local officials about another violent reaction in the
community, which has seen several racial eruptions this decade
after the slayings of blacks by police and the acquittals of police
officers after trials.
   Lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter in the deaths
of Clement Anthony Lloyd, 23, who was shot in the head while being
chased by police, and Allan Blanchard, 24, who suffered fatal
injuries when the bike crashed.
   As the trial's second week began Monday, lead prosecutor John
Hogan estimated that seating a six-member jury and four alternates
would take at least two weeks. But Monday's relatively brisk pace
could mean a jury will be seated more quickly.
   ``I assumed we'd have a lot more trouble than this,'' Hogan said.
   When the session ended for the day, nine people were retained as
prospective jurors and five were excused. Among those excused were
three people who said they had formed strong opinions on the case.
Most of the people questioned said they knew very little about the
case.
   Attorneys for both sides questioned prospective jurors on the
past riots and asked if they could remain impartial despite the
threat of violence looming over this trial.
   A white woman in her 50s, who said she followed the case in
newspapers and on television, said she couldn't put aside her fears
of possible violence.
   ``It's frightening,'' she said. ``You're afraid that if you were
on the jury and brought in a verdict the black community didn't
want to hear, there'd be rioting.''
   She was dismissed.
   A black woman, who works as a bus-maintenance clerk, said she
had not formed an opinion about the Lozano case. Asked about past
riots, she said, ``I don't believe in violence. We all suffer from
it.''
   But she indicated that the threat of violence would not affect
her verdict if she were on the jury.
   ``Whatever happens, happens,'' she said.
   She was told to remain as the jury-selection process continued.
   The shooting, which occurred on the birthday of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. during the week leading up to the Super Bowl, left
one person dead and caused millions in property damage.
   The defense says Lozano shot in self-defense.
   His attorney, Roy Black, won the acquittal of then-Miami officer
Luis Alvarez in the 1982 shooting of a young black man at a video
arcade in Overtown, just blocks from where Lloyd and Blanchard were
killed.
   That slaying and the innocent verdict in 1984 triggered racial
violence, as did the acquittal of five Metro-Dade officers tried in
1980 in the beating death of a black motorcyclist after a chase.

   An American Airlines 727 with 107 people
aboard landed safely Monday night after air turbulence that injured
three passengers and four flight attendants, officials said.
   Flight 860 from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Detroit, with a
scheduled stop in Nashville, landed safely at Nashville
International Airport around 6:30 p.m., p.m., American spokesman Al
Becker said from the airline's Dallas headquarters.
   ``Apparently, it experienced turbulence about 90 miles north of
Nassau in the Bahamas, at about 31,000 feet,'' Becker said.
   The pilot radioed ahead to reqest that paramedics be on hand in
Nashville. The Boeing 727 was carrying 100 passengers and a
seven-member crew, officials said.
   The three passengers and four flight attendants injured were
taken to a hospital for examination, said Metro Nashville Airport
Authority spokesman Stephan Foust.
   ``Three of them walked off the plane and four others were
carried off on stretchers,'' Foust said.
   All but one of the injured were treated at HCA-Donelson hospital
and released, said Nursing Administrator Cathy Parrish. The seventh
was still being examined late Monday.
   The injuries included sore backs, shoulder pain and hip pain,
Mrs. Parrish said.
   The plane was checked for damage, then continued on to Detroit,
only slightly behind schedule, Foust said.

   A jet practicing take-offs and landings
crashed into the tower of the aircraft carrier Lexington, then
cartwheeled and burst into flames on the flight deck, killing five
and injuring two, authorities said.
   The two-seater T-2 Buckeye jet, based at the Naval Air Station
in Meridian, Miss., crashed Sunday afternoon during the training
mission about 30 miles south of Pensacola in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The pilot approached too low for a landing and deck crewmembers
tried to wave the flier off before the crash, according to Rep.
Earl Hutto, D-Fla.
   The plane hit the tower of the 46-year-old aircraft carrier,
flipped over and slammed into a row of parked planes, said the
congressman, who was briefed by Navy officials.

   A decade after the Iran hostage crisis gripped
the nation, most Americans favor normalizing relations with Tehran
if it would win the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, a national
poll has found.
   Even while respondents supported such a deal, eight in 10 in the
Media General-Associated Press poll believed Iran supports world
terrorism, and roughly half regarded it as an enemy of the United
States.
   Nearly three-quarters believed Iran controls the groups holding
American hostages in Lebanon, and 61 percent said Washington should
offer to resume normal relations if Tehran used its influence to
get the Americans freed.
   Support was somewhat lower for releasing Iranian assets now
locked in U.S. banks if Iran got the hostages out, with 50 percent
in favor. Iran offered last week to help free the hostages if the
money were released.

   An advisory committee to the Department of
Veterans Affairs this week may open the door a crack to disability
benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   Responding to a federal court decision in May, the 15-member
Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards will look
again at scientific papers and studies on the herbicide used to
clear dense foliage that hid the enemy.
   This time, however, the committee will use standards considered
less strict than those used for determining other service-connected
disabilities.
   No one is predicting the outcome. But there is agreement that VA
Secretary Edward J. Derwinski wants to resolve the issue quickly
and in favor of veterans.

was illegal, but police kept their distance and state television
led the evening news with word of it.
   Sunday's anti-government rally at a soccer stadium outside
Johannesburg was the largest in South African history. New
President F.W. de Klerk is showing a greater tolerance toward
anti-apartheid protests than his predecessors.
   Breaking the law to thunderous applause, speakers at the rally
repeatedly praised the outlawed African National Congress'

   The District of Columbia's 1989 homicide toll
already equals last year's record of 369 killings _ with more than
half blamed on drug-related violence _ and officials say they see
no end in sight.
   With two months remaining in 1989, district police reported that
five slayings discovered during a seven-hour period over the
weekend brought the tally to last year's record death total.
   Three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs. The other
two were a 13-year-old girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to
death in their apartment Saturday.
   Police blame more than 60 percent of the district's slayings on
drugs, particularly the arrival of crack cocaine.

   A student pilot making his first landing
attempt on an aircraft carrier was ``low and slow'' before his
training jet crashed on the USS Lexington, killing him and four
others, the ship's captain said Monday.
   The T-2 Buckeye slammed into the island, the same part of the
ship hit by a kamikaze plane in World War II, before cartwheeling
across the deck and exploding in flames Sunday afternoon, said
Capt. C. Flack Logan.
   ``It looked like a battle zone,'' said Lt. Bruce Adams, a
physician and the ship's medical officer. ``There were pieces of
aircraft and of metal all over the place. Bodies were spread
throughout different areas.''
   In addition to the five dead, 19 people were injured, Logan said.
   The pilot, Ensign Steven E. Pontell, 23, of Columbia, Md., was
the only one aboard the two-seat trainer, a normal situation when
aviators make their first carrier landings, Logan said. Pontell, a
1988 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., was a
member of Training Squadron 19 at Meridian, Miss., Naval Air
Station.

   Then-President Reagan personally approved a plea
bargain offered to Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos three days before
they were indicted in October 1988, Mrs. Marcos' attorney says in
court papers.
   The papers add detail to reported failed negotiations just
before the deposed Philippine leader and his wife were charged with
siphoning more than $100 million out of their country's treasury
and into the United States.
   Marcos died Sept. 28. His wife awaits trial at U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
   Mrs. Marcos' lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, said in the papers filed
last month that government lawyers made the plea offer during a
meeting at the Justice Department in Washington attended briefly by
U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
   ``The attorney general started the meeting by advising us that
the president was aware that the meeting was taking place, and what
would be conveyed to us during the conference had the president's
full knowledge and approval,'' Hibey said.

   John Tesh is best known as co-host of
``Entertainment Tonight,'' but he's no ``Johnny One-Note.''
   Tesh is an Emmy-winning composer who recently scored his first
movie, ``Limit Up,'' which stars Dean Stockwell. His album,
``Garden City,'' named after his hometown in New York, is also just
out.
   ``In the past I've composed mostly for television sports
shows,'' he said. ``Scoring a movie is very different from doing an
album. You do an album for yourself. You decide what it should
sound like, how long the pieces will be.
   ``With film you work for the director. He tells you what he
wants. But it's a tradeoff because you get to work with pictures.
It forces you to work in ways you hadn't thought about.''
   Tesh spends most of his time as co-host with Mary Hart of the
daily syndicated ``Entertainment Tonight.'' However, he's been an
avid musician all his life and during five years as a CBS Sports
reporter he composed the music for the shows he worked on.
   In 1987 he won an Emmy for best original score for the Tour de
France bicycle race. He also did the on-the-scene commentary.
   ``When I went to CBS Sports I was hired as both an announcer and
composer. I did a lot of their sports themes. When I wet to France
for the bicycle race I took all my instruments and whacked away. I
reported on the race, wrote all the copy, wrote all the music,
played it and did the mix for the satellite feed.
   ``That sums up what I do well. It allowed me to use all my
talents. I'm a reasonably good writer and a reasonably good
performer. When that won the Emmy it let people in Hollywood know
that I wasn't just the co-host of `Entertainment Tonight.' People
took a second look. I got an agent and the assignment for `Limit
Up.'''
   Tesh grew up on Long Island, where he studied music with
teachers from Juilliard and was twice named to the New York State
Symphonic Band. He majored in music and communications at North
Carolina State University.
   ``I grew up influenced by the Beatles and Stones. In elementary
school, for music I picked drums. My second choice was guitar,
which they didn't offer, and my third was trumpet, which is what I
got. I had already been studying piano.
   ``When I joined a rock band nobody was playing keyboard then, so
I got my dad to loan me money for a Magnus chord organ. On our gigs
I'd stick a microphone next to it to amplify the sound. It worked
on air instead of electronics so it didn't sound instantly. I had
to play ahead of the rest of the band.''
   In college, Tesh began announcing at school dances, then became
a disc jockey on the school radio station. His first job after
college was as a producer and reporter on a television station in
Raleigh, N.C. He soon became anchorman at $125 a week. Next, he
went to Orlando, Fla.
   ``I only stayed there five months. I considered myself a serious
journalist and I left after the general manager wanted me to cover
his wife's garden party. I went to Nashville as anchorman. My
weather reporter was Pat Sajak and my co-anchor was Dan Miller,
who's also on `The Pat Sajak Show.' Oprah Winfrey was on the TV
station across the street.
   ``I kept doing music on the side. I always wanted to be a
successful musician. I nearly went to a station in Milwaukee but
I'd also sent an audition tape to CBS and I was hired for their New
York station. From there I went to CBS Sports.''
   He was working on an event in London in 1986 when he got a call
from Paramount Television asking him to come to ``Entertainment
Tonight.''

   Two decades after it set out to measure things by
the millimeter, liter and kilogram, Britain is part way there but
still not very enthusiastic about it.
   Shillings and sixpences are gone, and the liter _ spelled litre
here _ is showing up at gasoline stations.
   But miles are still the measure of the highways, and pounds and
kilograms depend on where you shop.
   ``Every retailer is afraid to change,'' said Andre Gabor, an
economist who has advised the government on going metric. ``No one
will go out on a limb for metric because they fear people might go
to the next shop.''
   ``I haven't personally gone metric,'' said Sir Thomas Padmore, a
former member of the Metrication Board, founded in 1969 to oversee
the transition.
   ``My principal hobby is gardening and I still use a gallon can.
There is total confusion in buying things like pesticides, which
are marked half in metric, half in imperial measure, and some
people are extremely tiresome about it.''
   Padmore, who is 80, added: ``Older citizens my age think it's a
damn nuisance.''
   As a member of the European Economic Community, Britain is part
of the tariff-free 12-nation trading bloc that will come into
existence at the end of 1992, and the resulting economic harmony
will put the British imperial system of weights and measures all
the more out of step.
   Thus, by order of the EEC, gills, gallons, feet, fathoms, pounds
and ounces are to be phased out by the turn of the century.
   The idea is to use the metric system for everything that is
negotiated across borders. Thus acres stay, as does the mile; the
cost of replacing every road sign in Britain and Ireland would be
enormous.
   Also saved are the furlong, a measure of horse-racing distance;
the troy ounce, in which gold bullion is traded, and the pint for
milk or a beer at the pub. The British also will still be able to
weigh themselves in stones, units of 14 pounds.
   Loose goods such as vegetables will stay imperial until 1999,
but packaged goods must come by the kilogram by 1995.
   The country's mistrust of the metric system dates to at least
1791, when it declined France's invitation to join in establishing
an international system devised by the Paris Academy of Sciences.
   Not until 1897 did Parliament legalize the use of metric
measures in trade and commerce.
   In 1965, Prime Minister Harold Wilson pledged Britain would go
metric, but he foresaw the problems when he remarked that the
British ``don't like four-syllable words like metrication.''
   Indeed, ``popping down to the pub for a 0.568 of a liter'' never
seemed likely to catch on, which is why the pint stays.
   A public opinion poll in 1970 indicated that most people
preferred the imperial measures. Fifty-seven percent opposed going
metric and only one-third said they understood the system, even
though it should be a lot simpler, since it works in multiples of
10 as opposed to the 12-inch foot, eight-pint gallon and 5,280-foot
mile.
   A government pin-up attempted the metric-is-beautiful approach
by showing bikini-clad Della Freeman with vital statistics in
millimeters _ 914-610-914.
   THINK METRIC, the poster exhorted, but Ms. Freeman didn't help
things by confessing a preference for inches.
   ``Millimeters sound so enormous that it is rather
unflattering,'' the model said.
   In inches, she's a 36-24-36.
   The currency was changed in the early 1970s. Out went shillings,
sixpences and half-crowns in favor of a decimal system whereby the
240-penny pound became the 100-pence pound.
   Despite intense grumbling from traditionalists, decimalization
worked. Schoolchildren began learning the metric system in 1974,
and it looked as though the 1979 deadline for full metrication
would be met.
   But in 1979 a poll found 46 percent still opposing metrication,
and today, says the National Consumer Council, British consumers
have the worst of both worlds.
   ``Consumers find that comparison of goods is made much more
difficult by the fact that products are often measured in different
ways in different shops,'' the council said. ``Conversion from one
system to the other is neither quick nor simple.''
   The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) favors metrication
to increase foreign trade and is confident its members will be
ready by 1992.
   ``In principle we should do all we can to extend our trading
markets,'' said John Scates of the CBI's International Affairs
Directorate. ``British industry must give the customers what they
want or you're asking for trouble because the next guy will please
the customer.''

<DATELINE>COLOGNE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Affluent young executives flocking
to West German cities like this scenic Rhine River metropolis have
a problem in common with the poor immigrants crowding in from the
East.
   Hundreds of thousands of them can find no place to live.
   West Germany, one of the world's wealthiest nations, has been
plunged into a housing crisis by its own prosperity.
   Demographic and economic warps have coincided to flood the
market with homeseekers at a time when the supply of new public and
private housing is virtually nil due to a construction lag five
years ago.
   ``Our postwar baby boom came along a little later than in the
United States, and we are now seeing hordes of young people with
good educations and good incomes flooding the housing market,''
said Stefan Kampmann, director of the German Tenants Association,
which monitors rental conditions nationwide.
   ``They can afford better housing, and they want it, but it just
isn't there.''
   The housing shortage loomed long before a wave of East European
refugees hit this year, but that influx expected to reach 500,000
by year's end has greatly aggravated the problem.
   The nation is now short about 800,000 homes. A million other
households are in need of major renovation.
   Thousands of recent arrivals from East Germany, the Soviet Union
and Poland sleep on cots in converted concert halls or in makeshift
metal housing erected on sports fields.
   The hundreds of thousands of upmarket homeless usually crowd in
with relatives or friends during the hunt for housing, which can
take years.
   West Berlin, Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt suffer the most acute
shortages, but officials concede the problem has reached crisis
proportions in virtually every city.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has declared housing the No. 1 budget
priority for next year and has promised special funds for new
construction this year and a review of tax and rent-control laws.
   Paradoxically, hundreds of thousands of potential apartments are
kept off the market by landlords in West Germany because of tax
consequences or building restrictions that prevent conversion of
attics and lofts.
   Pressure from all income brackets is mounting, and tales of
apartment-hunting woes abound.
   Desperate homeseekers advertise any way they can. A man in West
Berlin painted an appeal on the back of his leather jacket. Many
put up notices on trees and light standards.
   ``Desperate, well-paid two-income couple with small child will
pay 800 marks ($420) for information leading to obtaining a
three-room or larger apartment,'' said one of hundreds of such
notices posted in the Suedstadt neighborhood in Bonn, the capital.
   ``Non-smoking medical student seeks any room for 1989-90 study
year,'' a Heidelberg man, Rainer Schimpf, has likewise announced.
   Heike Schneider, a 29-year-old journalist in Bonn, said the
apartment shortage allows landlords to pick and choose tenants to
the point of discrimination.
   ``Landlords won't rent to students and single people because
they think you're going to wreck the place,'' said Ms. Schneider,
who shares an apartment with two roommates.
   While West Germans have more money to invest as their economy
booms, housing construction is a long-term investment with lots of
risks.
   Crowded with industry and covered with a spider's web of
freeways from the North Sea to the Bavarian Alps, little open land
is available for new suburban housing.
   Environmental codes strictly limit construction in urban areas,
and building and labor costs have risen so sharply that rents
double the going rate would have to be charged to recover
construction costs.
   A rent-control law has kept prices relatively stable at the
equivalent of about $600 to $725 a month for a 1,000 square feet of
living space.
   About 60 percent of West German households are renters.
   The German Home, Apartment and Land Owners Association in
Duesseldorf contends the government will have to loosen regulations
to encourage owners to rent second homes and spare rooms.
   Its president, Theodor Paul, says 225,000 more dwellings could
be brought into the market if owners could see a profit in it.

   It is still a crime to insult the
royal family in the Netherlands, as a 24-year-old Dutchman recently
learned when he was fined 500 guilders ($230) for displaying a
poster depicting Queen Beatrix as a pig.
   Most Dutch frown on insults to the House of Orange, whose fate
and fortunes have been entwined with the Low Countries for 400
years.
   Periodic polls indicate the public overwhelmingly favors
retaining its constitutional monarchy.
   ``The Orange family belongs to the antique furniture that we've
inherited, and it would be unwise to do away with it _ they might
be very valuable,'' said historian Coenraad Tamse of Groningen
University. ``They offer a simple icon of the continuity of Dutch
national identity.''
   Since 1898, the Dutch have been led by three queens _ the dour
Wilhelmina, a symbol of hope during the five-year Nazi occupation;
the motherly Juliana, and now the practical Beatrix, who has a
strong sense of her role in Dutch life.
   ``Beatrix has a very strong notion of historic continuity, even
though nothing could be further apart than the role of 16th-century
William and hers,'' said royalty writer Fred Lammers, referring to
Prince William of Orange, who led the Dutch fight for independence
from Spain in the 16th century.
   Although the 51-year-old Beatrix is far from a figurehead, her
official statements are closely tailored to fit the policy of the
elected government.
   An attractive woman with the characteristic ruddy cheeks of her
countrymen, Beatrix is unpretentious in public and dresses like a
prosperous middle-class matron.
   She and her husband, Claus, a former West German diplomat, mix
easily with the public and eschew extravagance.
   But Beatrix reportedly is concerned with maintaining respect for
the monarchy and insists on being called ``Majesty,'' rather than
``Ma'am,'' which her mother Juliana preferred.
   Over the centuries, the House of Orange has survived financial
and romantic scandal, as well as occupation by Napoleon's forces in
1795-1812 and by Hitler's in 1940-45. Both times its members fled
to England.
   Its current hallowed image dates from Wilhelmina, Beatrix's
grandmother, who was ``groomed to fit the mold formed by the
supposed Dutch national traits: virtuousness, diligence, charity,
religiosity, and aversion to violence,'' Professor Tamse said.
   Wilhelmina's bond with her people was irrevocably forged by her
frequent morale-boosting radio speeches from London during World
War II.
   Periodic scandals have failed to tarnish the Orange image.
   During the 1950s there was Queen Juliana's reported dependence
on a faith healer, which the media attributed to her depression
over the near-blindness of her daughter, Princess Christina, born
in 1947.
   In 1964, daughter Princess Irene enraged hard-line Protestant
factions by rejecting the royal family's Dutch Reformed Protestant
faith for Roman Catholicism to marry Prince Carlos Hugo de
Bourbon-Parma, who now is King Juan Carlos of Spain.
   Juliana's husband, Prince Bernhard, was Dutch industry's
unofficial ambassador until his implication in the Lockheed bribery
scandal in 1975.
   He was stripped of his rank as inspector-general of the Dutch
armed forces but is still highly popular and active in conservation
issues.
   Even the royal family's wealth _ reported to range from $80
million to $4.4 billion _ has failed to incite popular resentment.
   Beatrix and her family live in Huis ten Bosch (House in the
Woods), an estate in The Hague visible from the public highway.
Except for state occasions, Beatrix is driven around in a Ford.
   Their three sons study in the state-run university system and
room with friends.
   The heaviest public insult to the monarchy came in 1980, when
Juliana abdicated in favor of Beatrix. During the inauguration _
Dutch monarchs are not crowned _ stone-throwing squatters rioted
outside.
   ``In hindsight, the inauguration riots had less to do with the
monarchy than with anything else _ the housing situation,
unemployment, and the like,'' writer Lammers said. ``But as
national symbols, the royals bore the brunt of the unrest.''
   Despite her circumscribed role, Beatrix's interest in government
is keen, according to sources close to the royal family.
   She meets every Monday morning with Premier Ruud Lubbers and has
at least one extensive policy discussion a week with other Cabinet
ministers.
   The royals draw a line at exploitation of their private life by
the popular press.
   Four years ago, Claus obtained a court-ordered retraction from a
Dutch magazine for an unsubstantiated story alleging that their
eldest son, Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, spent the night with a
``mysterious blonde'' in an Amsterdam hotel.

<HEAD>In Peruvian Port, Shopkeepers Speak Russian</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CALLAO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dirty, decayed, haunted by hoodlums,
prostitutes and drug addicts, this fogbound seaport is not much
different from any other Latin American port of call _ except here,
the shopkeepers speak Russian.
   More than 200 ships of the Soviet fishing fleet operating in the
Pacific off Peru use Callao as a resupply point under a contract
signed by the two countries in 1971.
   For the Soviet Union, Callao represents an important but
controversial foothold in a region where Soviet influence has been
limited.
   About 30,000 Soviet crewmen a year, on six-month stints, shuttle
in and out on Aeroflot flights to nearby Lima, Peru's capital.
   The sailors, the most visible sign of the Soviet presence in
Peru, have become prominent targets for leftist terrorists, however.
   On July 5, a terrorist bomb tossed beneath a tour bus wounded 20
sailors from the fleet on a shopping and sightseeing trip. Many of
the wounded were badly maimed and burned.
   Six Soviet fishermen also were wounded in 1986 when a bomb
hidden under a pile of sweaters went off in a clothing shop
frequented by the sailors in Callao.
   Police attributed the attacks to the Shining Path, a leftist
insurgent group fighting since 1980 to topple Peru's government and
install a workers' and peasants' state patterned on the ideas of
the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung of China.
   The group also has attacked the Aeroflot office in downtown Lima
and a Peru-Soviet cultural center.
   On Oct. 25 rebels in a passing car hurled dynamite at the Soviet
Embassy, damaging a diplomat's car but causing no injuries.
   It was the second attack on the embassy in three years. In 1986
the Maoist guerrillas assaulted it with explosives and submachine
guns. One rebel penetrated the embassy compound but was blown up
when a bomb exploded in his hands.
   The Shining Path views the current Soviet and Chinese
governments as traitors to true Marxism and regards the Soviets as
enemies because they have been a major supplier of arms to the
Peruvian armed forces for the past two decades.
   Just before the July 5 bus bombing, the government announced it
had purchased four Soviet helicopter gunships for its fight against
the insurgents.
   Close relations between Peru and the Soviet Union go back to the
late 1960s, when the leftist military dictatorship of Gen. Juan
Velasco realigned Peruvian foreign relations toward the East bloc.
   Velasco outfitted his army and air force with Soviet arms and
aircraft, and despite subsequent changes in government Peru remains
dependant on the Soviets for training and spare parts.
   Today the country is the third largest purchaser of Soviet
military hardware in the Western Hemisphere, after Cuba and
Nicaragua.
   ``They are inhibited from turning away from the Soviet influence
because of decisions made 20 years ago,'' said a Western diplomat.
``They're hooked onto the chain.''
   Although staggered by a huge budget deficit and a $17 billion
foreign debt, the government is planning to buy 14 more helicopters
for use by its counterinsurgency forces.
   The government uses the fishing contract to help pay its debts
with the Soviets, almost all of which is for arms purchases.
   The agreement allows Soviet trawlers to harvest 400,000 tons of
fish a year inside Peru's 200-mile territorial-water limit. Peru
takes 17.5 percent of the catch.
   Critics complain the Soviets take as much as $1.5 billion worth
of fish each year without paying taxes and accuse the government of
doing little to control the take.
   ``They can fish where, when and as much as they want,'' said
Sen. Felipe Osterling, who submitted a formal complaint to the
government in April charging the fishing contract was
unconstitutional.
   The left-leaning government of President Alan Garcia has not
responded to the complaint.
   But businesses in blighted Callao welcome the tall blond
fishermen.
   ``Sweaters _ the cheapest; blue jeans, imported watches, and
they carry away lots of brown leather jackets,'' said Angelica
Casana, owner of a store that sells Peruvian handicrafts. ``They
take special sizes because they are very big.''
   The terrorist threat, however, has caused business to drop off
in Callao as the sailors try to maintain a low profile, she added.
   ``It's affected them, the fear,'' she said.
   ``They don't come like they used to, and some shops have closed
up and left.''

<HEAD>Year Five for Terry Anderson and the Hostage Ritual</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By now, in the fifth year of Terry Anderson's
captivity, there are rituals in the hostage impasse, tormenting
routines played over and over again.
   At home there are prayers and pleas. Abroad, there are demands.
In the government there is a litany: No deals, but every avenue
that might lead to freedom for eight captive Americans is being
pursued.
   Except that there are no known avenues at this point.
   All of it came together at Anderson's 42nd birthday, his fifth
as a hostage, observed Friday at Mass in a Georgetown University
chapel, sponsored by a volunteer organization called No Greater
Love.
   It was the 20th event that group had sponsored in behalf of the
hostages in Lebanon. It was the 1,686th day in captivity for
Anderson, chief of Middle East services for The Associated Press.
It was national Hostage Awareness Day by act of Congress, although
not a lot of people seemed to be aware of it.
   In the Senate, there is a daily reminder of Anderson's long
ordeal; Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., issues it at each
day's session, placing in the Congressional Record a speech, an
article or a count of the number of days Anderson has been held.
   The State Department repeated its familiar call for release of
the hostages on Friday, urging those who hold them to immediately
and unconditionally free all the hostages. ``No political cause can
justify these criminal acts,'' the department said in words used
over and over again during two administrations.
   Earlier in the week, the Shiite Moslem extremists who seized and
hold Anderson played out their part in the ritual, frustrating
evidence of the sameness and futility in it all.
   They repeated in the autumn of 1989 the demand with which they
began in the spring of 1985, for the release of 15 Moslem
terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait.
   With the demand, once again, came an instant photograph of
Anderson, captive and incommunicado somewhere in the Beirut area
since he was seized by gunmen on March 16, 1985. The photo was
similar to one released by the captors nearly a year ago.
   American officials have said all along that they do not control
the Kuwaiti prisoners, convicted in 1983 in embassy bombings that
killed five people, and that they would not make deals with
hostage-takers anyhow.
   The demand from Islamic Jihad, which also holds hostage Thomas
Sutherland, 57, came a day after the new president of Iran
suggested there might be another way out for the captive Americans,
and was read by some diplomats as a militant answer to the message
from Tehran.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran would try to help get the hostages
freed if the United States agrees to release Iranian assets frozen
in the Teheran embassy hostage crisis of 1979. He said the United
States also should help determine what happened to three Iranian
diplomats kidnapped in southern Lebanon in 1982 and believed to be
dead.
   Those, too, are familiar demands. And they drew a familiar
response. Officials at the State Department and the White House
said no deals for hostages, and that the United States has no new
information about the three Iranians. The dispute over frozen
assets, money and military equipment, is in the hands of a special
tribunal in The Hague, which periodically releases funds it
determines are owed Iran.
   ``Our position has not changed, that we do not link the Iranian
assets to the hostages, and we do not make deals for hostages,''
said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary.
   Eight Americans and 10 other Westerners are held hostage in
Lebanon, by militant Shiite groups aligned with Iran. But the
Iranian government always has disclaimed direct knowledge or
control of the captives, and Rafsanjani did so again.
   Administration officials now believe that the hostage situation
will be resolved only as part of a broader settlement including
some normalization of relations with Iran. President Bush came to
office saying he looked to a day of improved U.S. relations with
Iran, and inviting Teheran to move toward it by helping gain
freedom for the captives.
   The policy is unchanged. So is the plight of the hostages _
``year after frustrating year,'' as Peggy Say, Anderson's sister,
said at the birthday Mass.
   ``It is hope that motivates us to approach every ceremony as if
it would be the last,'' said Mrs. Say, a leader among the hostage
families.
   But there was no one to suggest anything more than hope; no new
policy, no promise, no sign of movement. Only the ritual farewells,
spoken with the suggestion that the next hostage ceremony must, at
last, celebrate freedom instead of marking bondage.

   The sound of classical music drifts from a large
upstairs dressing room at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre one hour before
an evening dress rehearsal. Gordon Matthew Sumner is playing Mozart.
   ``I think it helps to concentrate on something else for a minute
or two,'' says Sumner, better known as rock superstar Sting, as he
gets up from the piano. ``Otherwise, you end up worrying.''
   What occupies most of his time these days is ``3 Penny Opera,''
a revival of the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical about the
underworld of Victorian England. In it, Sting plays Macheath, a
rakish brigand nicknamed Mack the Knife. Macheath is a cutthroat
criminal, not to mention a devilishly handsome bounder and a ladies
man.
   The 38-year-old former bass player and singer for the Police
certainly looks the part. The golden locks have been cut and
slicked back. A mustache slashes the upper lip. But the eyes are as
blue and as mesmerizing as when he first filled stadiums and arenas
across the country singing such hits as ``Roxanne'' and ``Every
Breath You Take.''
   ``3 Penny Opera'' opens Nov. 5 on Broadway after a bumpy
out-of-town tryout.
   Reviews in Washington were unfavorable, especially for its star.
``If you're going to see Sting, prepare to be stung,'' sniffed one
critic. ``Slow and turgid stuff,'' said another. Cast members
reportedly were seen in New York auditioning for jobs in other
upcoming musicals. But director John Dexter and his company have
worked furiously on the show, and word of mouth, particularly
during the New York previews, has improved.
   ``I've learned an awful lot,'' Sting says. ``I know the
character is more convincing now than he was when I started
rehearsals in August. There's more of me in Mackie. You start with
a mask and you inject it with bits of yourself. I'm not saying you
become a murderer or a particularly bad person, but there are
moments in your life when you could be that person.''
   What has surprised the man who is making his Broadway debut in
the musical?
   ``I thought I would be less involved creatively. I thought I
would learn the lines, learn the blocking and just do it the same
way every night. It doesn't happen that way. The show is different
every night. Everybody's changing slightly. So the changes you do
have a domino effect.''
   Dexter, who won a Tony award in 1988 for directing ``M.
Butterfly,'' has a reputation as a tough taskmaster.
   ``He's very demanding, but I find working with him very
refreshing because he is very honest,'' Sting says. ``If you're
being rotten, he'll tell you. A good director holds a mirror up to
you and says: `This is good or bad. And it's your fault.' So I know
he's telling the truth.''
   ``3 Penny Opera'' is not Sting's first venture into the music of
Kurt Weill. Three years ago, he recorded ``The Ballad of Mack the
Knife'' and later performed Weill's music with the Hamburg State
Orchestra in West Germany.
   ``It's very strange music to sing,'' Sting says. ``Weill was a
student of Schoenberg, a very serious music man, and yet he
basically wrote pop music at the end of his career. He moved toward
pop music.
   ``That's an interesting point for me because I'm a pop musician
and I'm going the other way. His music is demanding. It has its
roots in European music but it also is very influenced by jazz.''
   ``3 Penny Opera'' was a quick flop when it was first done on
Broadway in 1933, but an off-Broadway revival in the mid-1950s
(starring Weill's widow, Lotte Lenya) ran for more than 2,600
performances.
   The odd spelling of the title, instead of the more traditional
``Threepenny Opera,'' was done to signify that this is a new
translation, done by Michael Feingold.
   The new stage production was the brainchild of producer Jerome
Hellman, best known as the man behind such movies as ``Midnight
Cowboy'' and ``Coming Home.'' Hellman and Sting are neighbors in
Malibu, Calif., and he persuaded the rock star to try the stage.
   Sting, whose father was a milkman in the working-class town of
Newcastle, England, studied English in college where he prepared to
be teacher. But he left teaching behind when he moved to London.
   ``I wanted to be a musician,'' he says. And he did, primarily in
jazz, before the Police was formed in 1977. He's had the name
``Sting'' since he was 18, when he wore black and yellow sweaters
that made him look, according to a friend, like a bee.
   Sting has been seriously studying singing for the last 10 years
_ ``to try and get out of my bad habits.''
   ``3 Penny Opera'' wasn't miked in Washington, but complaints
about the sound _ or lack of it _ brought out the microphones.
``But it's very subtle,'' Sting says. ``They don't make your ears
bleed like ours do when we play concerts.''
   The rock star has worked on his speaking voice, too, trying to
make it as resonant as his singing voice, and even has taken
tap-dancing lessons.
   ``Not because there's any tap dancing in the show,'' he says.
``I thought if I was going to learn dancing, I would try to learn
some of the most demanding dancing there is. It's brainwork, more
than anything else, trying to remember to tap so many steps to the
left and so many to right.''
   Sting's commitment to ``3 Penny Opera'' is for nine months, the
longest he has been in one place in 15 years. A new album, a
concert tour and a new movie will have to wait until the show
closes.
   ``It's demanding because of the process of adding, subtracting
and changing,'' he said. ``I'll probably go crazy, but I won't be
bored. Definitely not bored.''
   But that's the reason he did the show in the first place.
   ``I don't know what the fallout from this thing will be _
positive or negative,'' he says. ``I have no way of predicting it.
That's one of the exciting things about it. The important thing is
that I'm learning something. I think that's how I genuinely value
success or failure now.''

   Szilard went to England to introduce himself to Wells with the
idea, unavailing, of licensing his books in Central Europe. The
young scientist felt a personal calling to rescue the world from
itself through a brotherhood of its best and brightest. While
failing with Wells, Szilard filed away in the drawers of his memory
an apocalyptic preview from Wells' 1914 book, ``The World Set
Free,'' which forecast catastrophic destruction by atomic bombs.
   C.P. Snow, the reverse of Wells as a physicist who wrote novels,
said Szilard possessed an ``invulnerable egocentricity.'' But he
also, said a French biologist, was ``as generous with his ideas as
a Maori chief with his wives.'' He was given to long, reflective
walks but felt ``there is no place as good to think as the
bathtub.'' He would towel off after several hours of immersion and
apply for patents on his soap-born ideas.
   When the American Ernest O. Lawrence invented the cyclotron in
1930, which permitted firing subatomic particles at Rutherford's
nuclei, Szilard had already applied for a patent on a similar
device a year before. In any case, it was a new tool, something the
Americans were particularly good at inventing, to look more deeply
into the atom.
   In 1932 Rutherford's lab in England identified the uncharged
atomic particle, the neutron. Science now had a bullet to fire at
the nucleus of the atom without electrical interference from its
satellites.
   As science edged closer to the heart of the matter and the
immense power Einstein had postulated that lay there, its
practitioners were motivated by scientific venturing with slight
thought of other consequences. An atomic bomb?
   Frederick Alexander Lindemann, a British physicist who as Lord
Cherwell was to become Winston Churchill's wartime science adviser,
said in the 1930s he ``could scarcely believe that the universe was
constructed in this way'' as to make the atom a weapon. In
September 1933 Rutherford reiterated ``moonshine'' at a public
seminar and was quoted in a report of The Times. (Privately
Rutherford cautioned the War Office ``to keep an eye on the
matter.'')
   Also in that paper had been a review of Wells' latest book. As
it happened, one of the newspaper's readers was Leo Szilard. With
his usual prescience, he had seen where the anti-Semitism of ``Mein
Kampf'' was leading Germany and left the day before emigration fell
under Aryan restrictions.
   On a dank, lugubrious day in that September of 1933, Szilard
went for a walk. At one point he stopped for a red light near the
British Museum. But his mind kept on motoring. Wells' atomic bombs,
Rutherford's moonshine, flipped through his mind as did thoughts on
chemistry.
   There were such things in chemistry as chain reactions, but they
curtailed themselves eventually. But what if a Rutherfordian atomic
nucleus could be split by one of his neutrons such as shot by one
of Lawrence's cyclotrons? Would the nucleus release other neutrons
to hit other nuclei and so on in a chain reaction to release
Einstein's postulated energy?
   Thus the chain reaction of a scientific mind while waiting for a
light to turn green.
   In time Szilard would apply for a patent on an atomic chain
reaction. Not for the money. No, the purpose was to ensure a safer
and better world. He was concerned about ``disasters'' that might
occur if ``certain powers might attack this country.''
   He had learned from Lindemann that only the military could keep
a patent classified in Britain. Szilard applied to the War Office.
It turned him down. He tried the Admiralty with an accompanying
letter from Lindemann. It was hardly alarmist or wholehearted. ``.
.. even if the chances were a hundred to one against it,''
Lindemann wrote,``it seems to me it might be worth keeping the
thing secret as it is not going to cost the Government anything.''
   Secrecy was alien to science where new-found knowledge is a
torch passed from one lab experiment to another for the greater
good of all. As Isaac Newton said of the process, he had been able
to see so far only because ``I have stood on the shoulders of
giants.''
   One such giant of physics between the world wars was Enrico
Fermi, an Italian physicist of magnetic charm and such
infallibility he was nicknamed ``the Pope.'' Born in 1901, he had
been engrossed in physics since adolescence when he bought two old
books on the subject and read them through at once _ in Latin. An
experimenter known for exquisite precision, he could also ad-lib
with what was on hand, at one point using a goldfish pond to
moderate neutrons he bombarded all the elements with.
   Uranium responded exotically, resulting in a new element for
which Fermi won the 1938 Nobel prize. But he had seen so far and no
further.
   Fermi took his family with him to Stockholm to receive the
prize. They kept right on going to the United States. Laura Fermi
was Jewish.
   Unwittingly, the sinister anti-Semitism of ``Mein Kampf'' made
an incalculable contribution to the development of the atomic bomb.
At a stroke, Hitler's Aryan laws barring universities to Jews
reduced Germany's physicists by a quarter. Szilard had fled Germany
and so had his countrymen Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner. As the
``Hungarian Conspiracy,'' they would be an instrumental trio in the
crucial year of 1939.

   An Austrian Jew had forecast the diaspora: ``The French would
pray for the victims, the British would organize their rescue, and
the Americans would pay for it.'' In the end, the Axis paid for the
flight of Jewish science from Europe.
   In Denmark, Niels Bohr, a rugged theoretician who excelled at
soccer and transcended in physics to become a national hero, was a
clearinghouse of atomic information as well as a haven for emigre
Jewish researchers.
   One of those who escaped to Copenhagen was a young physicist,
Otto Frisch. His aunt, Lise Meitner, a chemist, continued working
at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. As an Austrian she was
not subject to Hitler's Aryan laws. She was born in Vienna in 1886
and became only the second woman there to earn a doctorate. She was
accepted for further study at KWI on the proviso that as a woman
she never show her face above her lab in the woodshop in the
basement. A pretty but shy young woman whose love in her life was
science, she accepted such exile.
   She formed a long and close partnership with Otto Hahn, also a
chemist. He was a handsome, gregarious outdoorsman. During World
War I he had worked on the dark side of chemistry _ helping with
Germany's poison gas detachments. He justified it as a means,
however murderous, of saving more lives by shortening the war. The
thought was not original with wartime scientists, then or later.
   Although they never even lunched together, Hahn and Meitner were
a close team, talking over their work on the atom's mysteries on
long walks, walking having played an inordinate role in the atom's
deciphering.
   When Hitler's troops marched into Austria in 1938, Meitner lost
her immunity. She hurriedly packed to leave for the Netherlands. In
farewell, Hahn gave her a treasured diamond ring that had been his
mother's. ``I wanted her to be provided for in an emergency.''
   Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, had closed the border to
fleeing scholastics. Meitner tried to look composed as soldiers
examined her passport.
   ``I knew that the Nazis had just declared open season on the
Jews, that the hunt was on. For 10 minutes I sat there and waited,
10 minutes that seemed like so many hours.''
   Then the soldiers passed her over the border. Unaware, they had
let a genie out of a bottle.
   Back in Berlin, Hahn continued bombarding uranium, now with
Fritz Strassmann. In early December of 1938 Hahn wrote Meitner, now
in Sweden, that something most unusual had happened. He and
Strassmann had found after one experiment that the uranium seemed
to have divided into two isotopes of barium whose weight did not
quite duplicate the weight of the original target. Although Hahn
had a good idea of what had happened, he asked Meitner for her
thoughts. And wished her a ``bearable Christmas.''
   Meitner was spending the holiday with friends near Goteborg.
There she was joined by Frisch, whose father was still interned in
the concentration camp at Dachau following the anti-Jewish pogrom
of Kristallnacht.
   On Christmas Eve, Frisch wanted to go cross-country skiing.
Meitner said she would walk along. Frish feared she couldn't keep
up. Oh yes, she could, Meitner insisted. She wanted to talk with
Frisch about Hahn's news. Frisch wanted to talk about a magnet he
had designed.
   ``Finally we became absorbed in my problem,'' she recalled.
   They sat down on a log and began sketching with a piece of paper
and a pencil Meitner had in her purse. She vividly remembered years
ago hearing Einstein lecture on his theory of relativity and how
the E equals mc2 evolved.
   She made the calculation of what the loss of weight in Hahn's
two barium isotopes had been compared to the uranium in terms of
Einstein's formula. The weight loss corresponded perfectly with the
energy that would been produced.
   Hahn and Strassmann had split an atom. Energy was released. A
new door had opened on the possibility of a chain reaction.
   Ironically, only a few days before, Szilard, now in the United
States at the University of Rochester, had written the British
Admiralty asking it to withdraw his patent on a chain reaction. The
odds of it happening, he explained, had ``just about reached the
vanishing point.''
   Just after the New Year Meitner cautiously wrote Hahn that
``perhaps ... such a heavy nucleus bursts.''
   On Jan. 3, 1939, Frisch, back in Copenhagen, began outlining
what the news from Germany had been and his discussion about it
with his aunt.
   Bohr's rapid mind raced ahead of his words.
   ``Oh, what idiots we have been!'' he said slapping his forehead.
``This is just as it must be!''
   Bohr was due to leave in four days for a stint at the Institute
for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. He asked that a blackboard be
installed in his stateroom aboard the ship.
   He had some noodling to do about atoms as he crossed the
Atlantic. A scientist from the Old World was bearing some startling
news to his colleagues in the New.

   It's a handbook for generals and politicians,
Wall Streeters and labor leaders, anybody playing to win. It's
centuries-old advice from a Chinese militarist who now seems to be
upstaging an Italian philosopher whose pragmatic ideas were once
considered the gospel for getting ahead.

   Move over, Machiavelli.
   The current bible of play-to-win strategists is no longer that
16th century Italian author's ``The Prince,'' but the much older
writings of the Chinese military tactician Sun Tzu, assembled as
``The Art of War.''
   Sun Tzu's writings finally reached the Western world in the late
18th century and were reputedly followed by the Soviet Red Army,
the Japanese military, Vietnamese guerrilla leader Ho Chi Minh and
Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung. The works drew little
attention in the United States until recent years, but have been
become increasingly popular. For example:
   _Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater, perhaps the most
hard-nosed political strategist of this decade, is a devotee who
reads ``The Art of War'' before every campaign.
   _Eastern Airlines machinists union leader Charles E. Bryan, one
of the airline industry's most powerful and most controversial
labor heads this decade, hands out copies of the Sun Tzu text to
all his organizations general chairmen.
   _And in director Oliver Stone's movie ``Wall Street,''
Oscar-winning actor Michael Douglas' ``greed is good'' character,
Gordon Gekko, advises his protege: ``Read Sun Tzu, `The Art of
War.' `Every battle is won before it's fought.' Think about it.''
   Stone, in Los Angeles finishing ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
about the life of Vietnam War double-amputee Ron Kovic and his
anti-war crusade, said that while ``The Art of War'' isn't yet
widely read on Wall Street, it was appropriate to the thinking of
Gekko, ``ruthless, yet accurate.'' As did Sun Tzu, Gekko emphasized
the importance of information and use of spies.
   Atwater, who recently read ``The Art of War'' for the 20th-plus
time on a flight from Washington to San Francisco, calls the book
``the most succinct strategy document ever written.''
   ``Everything in it you can relate to my profession, you can
relate to the campaign,'' Atwater says. ``Every time I read it, I
am reminded of something very important.''
   Some scholars consider ``The Art of War'' common sense put on
paper and don't quite understand its current popularity.
   ``It was always around and I personally find it to be a
collection of little aphorisms,'' says June Dreyer, a University of
Miami professor of political science and a student of Chinese
military history. ``For example, he says: `Know your enemy and know
yourself.' I think every ghetto kid in Chicago is thinking that
before he gets into a fight.''
   Dreyer suspects that one of the reasons the book is so popular
is that ``there's a certain panache to quoting an ancient Chinese
author.''
   Sun Tzu's emphasis on the aspects of psychology,
information-gathering, deception, planning and limiting casualties
are applied to many cases by his students. History, they point out,
is full of examples of how leaders failed to follow the basic rules
of Sun Tzu.
   James Clavell, the author and screenplay writer who has studied
Chinese and Japanese military thought, wrote in a foreword to one
of the English translations:
   ``I truly believe that if our military and political leaders in
recent times had studied this work of genius, Vietnam could not
have happened as it happened.
   ``We would not have lost the war in Korea (we lost because we
did not achieve victory), the Bay ofPigs could not have occurred;
the hostage fiasco in Iran would not have come to pass; the British
Empire would not have been dismembered, and in all probability,
World Wars I and II would have been avoided _ certainly they would
not have been waged as they were waged, and the millions of youths
obliterated unnecessarily and stupidly by monsters calling
themselves generals would have lived out their lives.''
   Little is known about the personal background of Sun Tzu, an
adviser and general for Chinese warlords. Scholars have differed on
when he wrote his guide to warfare, with some saying the seventh
century B.C. and others saying the third century. And some have
argued that he never existed at all and that ``The Art of War'' is
a compilation.
   Sun Tzu wrote that ``moral law,'' belief in the cause and in the
leaders, is crucial to victory, as is command discipline. The
object is not to devastate the enemy, but to win with as little
actual engagement as possible, he wrote.
   Among his teachings:
   _``To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme
excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's
resistance without fighting.''

   _``All warfare is based on deception.''
   _``In war, numbers alone confer no advantage. Do not advance
relying on sheer military power.''
   _``While we have heard of blundering swiftness in war, we have
not yet seen a clever operation that was prolonged.''
   _``War is a matter of vital importance to the state ... It is
mandatory that it be thoroughly studied.''
   _``If you know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear
the result of a hundred battles.''
   A desire to know his foe led Bryan, the union leader, to ``The
Art of War'' some 10 years ago.
   ``There was a rumor that management was using that book,'' said
Bryan, who bought copies for himself and his union leadership.
   ``It's mostly lessons, more on understanding and anticipating
the strategy of an adversary and being prepared to deal with it,''
said Bryan, who in 1983 took his union to the brink of a strike
before management gave in with a favorable contract. In 1986 he was
blamed by Eastern officials for forcing the sale of Eastern to
Texas Air Corp., and this year he led the strike against Eastern
that began March 4.
   Bryan emphasizes gathering information about the company and
management and usually keeps his strategy as secret as possible,
both Sun Tzu-type attributes. The strategies of Bryan, also based
on personal philosophical and religious beliefs, have come under
fire as Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo follows a plan to rebuild
Eastern without its unions.
   Atwater, who first read ``The Art of War'' while a University of
South Carolina graduate student, read it again this summer and
savored how Sun Tzu's guidelines had been followed in the 1988
presidential campaign.
   ``He talks in there repeatedly about keeping your own group
united,'' Atwater says. ``One of the driving things of the Bush
campaign was keeping united.''
   Atwater says the importance of laying out a strategy and
sticking to it, as taught by Sun Tzu, was demonstrated in the Super
Tuesday strategy in which Bush effectively locked up the Republican
nomination with his domination of the South. The plan to use the
South to defeat Bush's opponents had been planned for three years,
Atwater says.
   One of Atwater's favorite Sun Tzuisms is, ``When you get into
the mind of your opponent, you can move it.''
   Asked about deception and other Sun Tzu tactics, Atwater
chuckles. ``You'll have to get someone else to make observations on
that.''
   Atwater also read and was influenced by Machiavelli, best known
for advising the powerful that the end justifies the means in
gaining and maintaining power.
   ``I think Sun Tzu is a highly refined version of `The Prince,'
'' Atwater says.
   ``The Art of War'' can be found these days in U.S. military
study libraries, and is on a suggested reading list the U.S. Marine
Corps compiled this year.
   Marine Lt. Col. Fred Peck says Sun Tzu's writings contrast in
approach to another highly recommended war strategy work, ``On
War,'' by the 19th century Prussian military author Karl von
Clausewitz. Clausewitz's teachings, contained in 10 to 12 volumes,
also combine social, political and personal factors with military
strategy.
   Clausewitz presents his theories ``at extreme length and in
excruciating detail,'' Peck says.
   ``Sun Tzu wrote his book as a primer for warlords. It's got a
lot of pithy little advice, a lot lighter reading.''
   Samuel B. Griffith, a retired Marine brigadier general who
translated and published Sun Tzu three decades ago after writing
about China's civil war, wrote that ``The Art of War'' should be
``required reading for those who hope to gain a further
understanding of the grand strategy'' of both the Soviet and the
Chinese leadership.
   However, Ms. Dreyer says, the current Chinese leadership
apparently doesn't follow Sun Tzu. Their bloody quelling of the
summer's student protests goes against ``The Art of War''
philosophy that says the government must serve the people's
interest and maintain national unity.
   The Chinese military's handling of the students, she says, was
``not Sun Tzu.''

   Music is mere vibration in the air, and
difficult to get your hands on. But there are a lot of dollars in
music, and a special kind of private cop is out there to make sure
the artists and composers get their share.

   No sirens. No flashing lights. No guns
or billy clubs. Just a notebook and a pen and an ear for popular
music. These are the jukebox police.
   They are undercover spies, actually, private citizens backed by
civil law. Their duty is to find people who make money from music
without paying rights fees to the artists and composers. Some
people don't take them seriously until they find themselves in
court being sued for thousands of dollars.
   ``They think you're kidding,'' says Andy Kropelak, an
ex-schoolteacher who patrols West Virginia and western Pennsylvania
for Broadcast Music Inc. ``It's not a joke. It's not a scam.''
   BMI and the American Society of Composers, Artists and
Publishers are the principal enforcers of music copyright laws. The
organizations collect license fees from establishments that use
music in nearly every form _ whether it be a bar, a bank or a
brothel.
   ``They are not only the jukebox police, they are the licensers
of music throughout an area,'' says Jonathan Zavin, a private
lawyer for BMI.
   ``If it weren't for BMI or ASCAP, every bar and restaurant would
have to contact each songwriter individually to get permission to
play his music,'' Kropelak says.
   For jukeboxes, the U.S. Copyright Office collects $63 for
registrations and splits the money among the composers and
publishers' agencies. In addition to its field representatives, BMI
uses a network of people who log the songs they hear played on the
ubiquitous jukeboxes.
   ``With 50 or so field men, whatever they can do is a drop in the
bucket,'' says Ted Chapin, a lawyer for BMI in New York. ``Every
city, town and street corner has somebody using music. It's a
question of having enough hands and feet to get there.''
   One logger hit Joey's Bar and Grill in Charleston, W.Va., last
year after a Steppenwolf fan dropped a few quarters in the jukebox
and played ``Born To Be Wild'' and ``Magic Carpet Ride.'' A
country-and-western fan punched ``D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' and ``Rocky Top''
and a nostalgic soul played ``Heartbreak Hotel'' and ``Wipeout.''
   Unknown to owner Joseph Minardi, the BMI logger made a playlist
that became the basis for a federal court lawsuit. Minardi settled
out of court for $12,000 in damages and attorneys' fees even though
he only leased the machine from a man who kept half the profits.
   ``I didn't have any idea that a license was supposed to be on
it,'' Minardi says. ``He made no mention that there had to be a
license on it.''
   Minardi now has a current license for a new machine he purchased
himself. A fully authorized version of ``She Drives Me Crazy'' by
Fine Young Cannibals was playing.
   ``When I bought my own jukebox, they sent me information saying
this machine had to be registered with BMI and all that,'' he says.
``That was the first I'd heard of it.''
   The suit was based on songs played before Minardi obtained his
license. He says he forwarded cease-and-desist requests to the
owner of the jukebox, who has since died.
   BMI files up to 200 suits a year against bars, restaurants and
nightclubs, generally seeking between $500 and $1,000 for each song
title heard.
   Four years ago, Ric Ocasek from The Cars, Bruce Springsteen and
Prince took matters into their own hands, filing suit together to
stop a southern West Virginia bar from playing their music
illegally.
   ``We try to call and write and see them,'' Chapin says. ``The
suit is only the last resort. We're not in the business of filing
suit. We're in the business of licensing music.''
   Like Minardi, most violators succumb quietly, agreeing to pay
BMI a few thousand dollars for past violations and agreeing to
purchase the $63 jukebox license.
   Kropelak says he has often had trouble in West Virginia and his
boss, BMI general licensing vice president Tom Annastas, says it's
because many people resent being asked to pay for what they already
consider theirs.
   ``We've had our field representatives roughed up. Whenever you
go in some place and tell someone they have to pay for something
they don't feel they should have to pay for, they resent that,''
Annastas says.
   ``They've bought the disc jockey, they've bought the record or
bought the tape, and you go in there and tell them they have to pay
something else.''
   For that reason, BMI loggers ask to remain anonymous for fear
bar owners will retaliate.
   ``If they would just take care of business, I wouldn't have to
worry about it,'' says the logger who busted Joey's. ``It should
never reach that point.''
   The Joey's logger was a local musician who was upset that some
people would use music for free. BMI officials say they look for
other musicians to make the job as easy as possible.
   ``The first criteria is their knowledge of music and their
ability to recognize music, whether it be in a drugstore, a
nightclub or a skating rink,'' Siebel says. ``It's one thing tohe issue.
The issue is, is industry willing to invest to make
it a good neighbor?''
   Lusk cited Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. as a business that has
done just that by installing new equipment to reduce emissions that
were blamed for killing trees and slowing tree growth in the area.
   But others believe a balance of development cannot _ or should
not _ be struck.
   ``This area is not appropriate for many reasons _ for
aesthetics, for wildlife, for destroying the qualities of why
people want to come here or live here,'' says John Frederick of the
North Fork Preservation Assocation, which filed legal challenges to
both Cenex wells proposed in the area.
   Frederick lives in Polebridge, a tiny community five miles north
of the well site. The preservation group he heads also has opposed
the British Columbia coal mine, some subdivision efforts and
proposals to pave the dirt road that leads to Polebridge.
   ``People don't come up here to see oil wells,'' Frederick said.
   Another environmental group has targeted development in an area
just southeast of the park, where two companies have proposed
drilling test wells for oil and gas.
   The proposals by Chevron and American Petrofina have been
delayed, however, while the Lewis and Clark National Forest
prepares an environmental impact statement.
   The wells are proposed in the Badger-Two Medicine region, a
110,000-acre roadless area located just south of the park and near
two wilderness areas.
   The Badger-Two Medicine Alliance, seeking wilderness designation
for the area, has fought the drilling proposals. Alliance president
Lou Bruno feels development would damage the area severely.
   But oil and gas industry officials maintain that development can
occur with little effect on the environment.
   Keating noted that Cenex planned a number of precautions at its
well site, including measures to keep wildlife away from the site
and to protect the quality of surface water. Drilling also would be
limited to certain times of the year, to avoid periods of eagle
nesting and animal migration.
   ``Historically, there are producing wells on college campuses,
downtown business districts, in back yards,'' he says. ``They can
be made almost totally compatible with almost any environment.''

   The poles of pro-life and pro-choice in the
abortion debate seem ever farther apart. Here is a group of women
who have based a women's help center on the biblical quotation from
Jeremiah: ``Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be
comforted because her children are no more.''

<TEXT>
   In the aftermath of the Florida Legislature's
defeat of efforts to tighten abortion regulations, the battle
continues.
   In this city, for instance, there is a volunteer group called
the Sisters of Rachel that seeks to help women out of the trauma of
abortion. And there are experts who deny abortion produces
long-term emotional pain.
   The Sisters of Rachel have a counseling center where they teach
women to cry, to blame and to forgive, especially themselves.
   ``There's so many women out there hurting like we were,'' says
Linda Gardner, a co-founder of the Sisters. ``This is a place they
can come and let all that grief come out.''
   Gardner says she didn't begin to deal emotionally with her
abortion until nearly 10 years later.
   Judy Rivenbark, who operates the Tampa Women's Health Center,
doesn't think women suffer guilt pains after abortion.
   ``I have worked in abortion for many, many years,'' Rivenbark
says. ``Most women have come to terms with their decision by the
time it's made. I do not believe in this post-abortion syndrome.
Afterward I don't see a lot of depression, tears or guilt. I see a
lot of relief.''
   The health center performs abortions twice a week in
Hillsborough County where there were 5,577 abortions last year.
There were 62,539 in Florida.
   Elaine Tennant of the Sisters of Rachel says she had to overcome
the guilt of her own abortions. ``It catches up sooner or later.''
   ``I wouldn't let anybody get close to me,'' says Tennant, 28.
``I didn't tell anybody about my pregnancies. I began to feel it
was my closet secret. I was a bitter person, not once, but twice.''
   She had abortions when she was 17 and 21. It wasn't until four
years after her second abortion that she first saw pictures of
fetal development.
   ``A baby at 11-12 weeks was fully formed with everything
functioning. A heartbeat. A nervous system. I freaked out. It was
the first time I really sobbed over what I had done.''
   Gardner, Tennant and Pat Layton founded the Sisters of Rachel
four years ago and since have counseled more than 170 women. It has
no relationship to the Roman Catholic Rachel Society, which also
counsels women and tries to persuade them to carry their
pregnancies to term.
   The reasons women decide to abort are as varied as the women,
says Rivenbark of the Tampa Womens Health Center. ``They come here
for financial reasons, too many children, alcohol or drugs, spousal
abuse, illness, fetal abnormalities and lack of education about
birth control.''
   Ninety percent of the abortions are performed in the first
trimester, Rivenbark says. ``At eight weeks there's nothing there;
it looks like a cloud,'' she says.
   In January the founders of the Sisters of Rachel also started
the North Tampa Crisis Pregnancy Center where they offer free
pregnancy tests and information on alternatives to abortion clinics.
   ``In this program we want to tell women what it is all about;
give them the facts, the options, and let them make an informed
decision,'' says the 35-year-old Layton.
   ``We try to sway them not to abort,'' says Gardner, 29.
   For seven months they went to seminars, read, took counseling
courses, drew on their own experiences, then devised a format.
   What developed was a post-abortion syndrome support group that
meets once a week for six to eight weeks. Today, they get referrals
from psychologists, the women's center, a hot line, area
universities and others who have been through the program.

   The first night, in small groups of five or six, the women sit
around and talk about their abortions. ``A lot of them come in
terrified because they've never told anyone. Some come because they
can't handle the pressure anymore. We're their last resort,'' says
Tennant.
   ``Usually, it's a night of crying,'' adds Layton. ``They admit
their secret.''
   Gardner was probably past three months in her pregnancy when she
had an abortion at age 17. ``My self-worth was zero,'' she says.
``There were six of us in a group at the clinic. I remember
thinking we were like cows.
   ``Everyone was crying. I sobbed uncontrollably when they asked
me afterward how I felt. I said, `I think I just killed my baby.'
But I was so relieved it was over, that I wasn't pregnant anymore.
I went on with life.
   ``I became real promiscuous, married six months later, had a
child right away to make up for it. Then I divorced, went back to
promiscuity and got into alcohol and drugs.''
   She went on for four years before deciding as a single parent
she had to do something else. She got a real estate license and
sold houses figuring it would make her happy and rich and put her
around people who didn't do drugs.
   ``This wasn't it either,'' Gardner said. Then she met her
husband. ``He was a Christian. I told him about the abortion and he
accepted me.''
   When she was three months pregnant with their child she had a
sonogram. ``I couldn't believe it. I had never looked at fetal
development. This was the same point at which I had had my
abortion. It was a good negative. It was clear. This was a baby.''
   Even after she delivered her second child, Gardner said the
abortion still troubled her. She talked to a woman at church.
   ``I unleashed everything that had happened. Over the past 10
years I had been running from this bad person,'' says Gardner, now
a mother of three.
   The first night at the center is informal and flexible.
   ``We're just there to lead them through it. Sometimes when the
hurt is so deep it takes longer,'' says Tennant. ``It takes a lot
out of you to deal with people in such a state. Some are suicidal.
We've had some who had abortions three weeks earlier and their
bodies haven't even healed yet. Once we had a woman who had a
back-alley abortion 30 years ago and was still carrying around the
guilt.''
   Finally, there is a night for grieving and making peace.
   If problems remain, the women are referred to outside counseling.
   Out of the Sisters of Rachel grew the crisis pregnancy program
where they have counseled 70 women this year.
   Three women who visited, thinking of having abortions, changed
their minds. ``Even if one ends positively, it's worth it,'' says
Gardner.
   ``If they want to look into adoptions, we hook them up with an
attorney. If they want to keep the baby but can't afford it, we
help them find help,'' says Tennant.
   While abortions at the Tampa health clinic run between $280 and
$850, they can run up to $1,500 for more advanced pregnancies,
Rivenbark says.
   The Tampa center does abortions up to 17.9 weeks of pregnancy.
After that, women are referred to the St. Petersburg center for
two-day procedures. Rivenbark says doctors won't accept women
further along than 20.5 weeks.
   A woman is asked if she has considered options and told of the
surgical risk _ from infection to an emergency surgery.
   ``If a girl is unsure, or doesn't want the abortion and is being
pushed by a boyfriend or parents, we give referrals,'' Rivenbark
says.
   Outside her clinic, a lone picket parades silently on the
sidewalk wearing a four-foot sign. It reads: ``Lord Jesus Forgive
Our Nation.''

   In the early decades of the century, it was the
gathering place of artists and writers, bon vivants and aspiring
models, American expatriates and Russian political exiles.
Montparnasse, on the left bank of the Seine River in Paris, was a
neighborhood of remarkable creativity and unflagging revelry. Today
it is the site a cult art form in France.
   But it is Paris' lone skyscraper, the sleek Montparnasse Tower,
that is perhaps the clearest symbol of a new age.
   ``Now, there are just one or two painters. It's not like
before,'' says Aime Duhauvel, a house painter who for 51 years
lived at 8 Rue de la Grande Chaumiere, where Modigliani had his
atelier.
   Duhauvel, forced out of his apartment by high prices in 1984,
returns daily to chat with his friend, the local shoemaker.
   Ms. Goddard, who has lived on the Isle of Wight since 1935, says
she ``ran away'' to escape what was becoming the incestuous
smallness of the quarter.
   The gentrification of Montparnasse was inevitable, says Billy
Kluver. ``The artists create the community and the real estate
people move in.''
   For Kluver, who spent 10 years gathering documentation for his
book, the spirit of Montparnasse is dead.
   Not everyone agrees.
   ``This neighborhood inspires me,'' says Alice Mouradian, a
clothes designer who lives two doors from Hemingway's former Paris
abode. ``Each building here possesses a soul.''
   Mrs. Kowalezyk says her clients at Wadja are the same as before,
just younger. ``For us, things haven't changed,'' she says. ``It's
difficult with our prices, but people still need to eat.''
   ``To make a long story short,'' Kluver quotes Kiki's memoirs,
``Montparnasse is a village that's as round as a circus. You get
into it and you don't know just how, but getting out again is not
so easy!''
   Kiki simply ``burned herself out,'' says Kluver, collapsing and
dying at age 52, not far from the boulevard.

   Before taking the role as a teen-age doctor
on ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' Neil Patrick Harris talked to
some real physicians. They laughed at the premise but still gave
him advice.
   ``I didn't find any teen-age doctors when I did some research,''
he says. ``Most prodigies are in the arts. But it's possible that a
young person could become a doctor. There are no age limits.''
   Harris sees Doogie Howser as a normal kid who just happens to be
a doctor.
   ``The role's purposely written to have all the qualities any kid
would have,'' he says.
   Doogie is a prodigy who graduated from Princeton at the age of
10, from medical school at 14, and now, at 16, is a hospital
resident. He can perform surgery, but he's just old enough to get a
driver's license.
   ``The contrast is between him being a normal kid and being a
doctor,'' says Harris. ``Most of the humor comes from his age.
Women say they don't want a 16-year-old kid examining them. In the
pilot, an adult attorney whined when I sewed up his rear and
threatened to sue me. But Doogie with his intellect and savvy gets
out of it.
   ``Doogie's an only child and his parents try to treat him as
much like a normal teen-ager as possible. They realize he's a
genius and a doctor and that makes it more complicated. He told his
mother the facts of life when he was 3 years old.''
   ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' is the first show from Steven Bochco in
his multi-series deal with ABC. Bochco, whose past co-creations
were ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``L.A. Law,'' wrote the comedy with
David E. Kelley. The show has been successful in the ratings,
although not a major hit.
   The series also stars James B. Sikking and Belinda Montgomery as
Doogie's parents, Lawrence Pressman as the hospital chief of
services and Max Casella as his teen-age buddy.
   Taking time away from the set, Harris is interviewed in the
building 20th Century Fox has built for Bochco, sitting on a bench
in an open, atrium-like area.
   Like his character, Harris is 16 and attempts to lead a normal
life while showing his own genius for acting. Before beginning the
series, he lived in Albuquerque, N.M., and attended school there
between movies. His parents, who are both attorneys, have moved
temporarily to Los Angeles.
   Most recently, Harris starred with Faye Dunaway and Richard
Widmark in ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' a turn-of-the-century drama on
Turner Network Television. Last season he was in the Hall of Fame
production ``Home Fires Burning'' and ``Leave Her To Heaven.'' He
was in the feature film ``Clara's Heart'' with Whoopi Goldberg.
He's also had several guest roles in series, including a role as a
child evangelist who was beginning to stray toward evil on ``B.L.
Stryker,'' with Burt Reynolds.
   Harris auditioned for the role of Doogie Howser about the time
he was doing ``Home Fires Burning.''
   ``There were four of us up for the role,'' he says. ``They
narrowed it down to three before it worked out that I got it. I
talked to Steven before he wrote the script.
   ``I thought it was a great concept. It's neat to have a series
based on a child. With `The Wonder Years,' adults can look back and
say, `Yes, I remember when that happened to me.' Here, we're in the
present and people can say, `Yes, I remember my first kiss.' But it
suddenly changes. He's a doctor. Still, there are things you can
relate to.
   ``The show's a mixture of comedy and serious subjects. Lots of
times Doogie wants to lash out at adults who treat him as a child
when he's smarter than they are.''
   Harris is a junior in high school this year and hopes to go on
to Yale or New York University or the University of Southern
California, but not to study medicine, which he says is too hard
and takes too many hours.
   ``I want to make the transition to adult actor,'' he says.
``That's a real barrier. I don't want to be typecast as a certain
character. I think some child actors get typecast with their hair
slicked back or as a nerd or like the Fonz.''
   Harris began acting at the age of 6 when he accompanied his
brother Brian to a school audition for ``The Wizard of Oz.'' He
played Toto.
   ``I was doing magic even before that,'' he says. ``Sleight of
hand, illusions, producing things out of nowhere, you name it. I
want to take magic as far as I can. It's a great hobby. I don't
think I'll do it professionally. There are no schools. The best way
to get into magic is to study with someone as an apprentice.''
   But don't be surprised if Doogie puts on a magic show for sick
kids at the hospital.

   It requires a special talent to take an obscure
wedding dance by Edvard Grieg and turn it into a Hit Parade smash
like ``Strange Music'' or transform the exotic themes of Borodin
into songs like ``Stranger in Paradise'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and
Beads.''
   For much of their careers, George Forrest and Robert Wright have
used that talent, adapting someone else's music, usually a
classical composer, and spinning it into something new.
   They did it in Hollywood, working on dozens of films like
``Maytime,'' ``Sweethearts'' and ``I Married an Angel,'' and on
Broadway with shows like ``Song of Norway,'' ``Magdalena'' and
``Kismet.''
   ``Writing original music is 10 or 20 times easier than the
things for which we are best known,'' Wright was saying the other
day. ``The first thing you have to do as an adapter is learn
everything a composer ever wrote. Then you have to assemble and
assimilate the music. And finally, think the way he did.''
   At 75, Wright is the talkative member of the songwriting team.
Forrest, one year younger, nods in agreement. Their partnership has
lasted some 60 years. It began at Miami Senior High School where
they wrote their first song _ ``Hail to Miami High!'' _ and has
continued into the present. Their latest musical, ``Grand Hotel,''
currently is on view at the Martin Beck Theater.
   ``Grand Hotel,'' directed and choreographed by Tommy Tune,
focuses on the guests at a large luxury hotel in Berlin. It's based
on the 1920s best-selling Vicki Baum novel that later became a
successful movie starring Greta Garbo and John Barrymore.
   The musical, using an original Wright and Forrest score, takes
place in 1928, a year its composer and lyricist remember very well.
   ``We were both working musicians by that time,'' Wright says.
   ``I had won an amateur contest playing the Rachmaninoff `C Sharp
Minor Prelude' when I was 9 and went into vaudeville. I found out
very young that there was money in music, so I never touched the
piano unless I was paid.
   ``I played for Helen Morgan, Leonard Rose and Sally Rand, all in
the same year. I think it was 1933.''
   Two years later, at ages 21 and 20, Wright and Forrest went to
Hollywood and found work at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., the studio
associated with the classiest of the movie musicals. They were
signed to write original music and lyrics. But the team found
little work until a disaster nearly derailed a film version of
Sigmund Romberg's ``Maytime,'' starring Nelson Eddy and Jeanette
MacDonald.
   Irving Thalberg, the legendary producer, died with only half the
film musical completed. A new director started over, and Wright and
Forrest were assigned to come up with new musical material. Much of
it was taken from music already in the public domain, pieces like
Tchaikovsky's ``Fifth Symphony'' and pieces of operas. The movie
was a big success, and Wright and Forrest stayed in Hollywood for
seven years, participating in some 50 movies, often anonymously.
   ``We worked on anything they asked,'' Wright says. ``You're
slaves in Hollywood, very happy slaves, but they owned us body and
soul. We always did our very best and worked as artistically as we
possibly could.''
   Finally, they quit. Herbert Stothart, MGM's famous musical
director and their mentor, told them: ``They'll keep you forever.
People will never know who you are.''
   Before they left they wrote a small musical revue called ``Thank
You, Columbus,'' that opened _ and closed _ in Los Angeles. But
through it, they met producer Edwin Lester who vowed to put on
their next show.
   ``Once you write anything for the stage and you put it in front
of an audience and you hear them react, then the movies become very
dreary and dull,'' Wright says.
   The team traveled to New York to write for cabaret, nightclubs
and radio. The work included special club material for performers
like Jimmy Durante, Ella Logan, Sophie Tucker, Joe E. Lewis, Jane
Froman and Carmen Miranda.
   Lester reappeared in their lives in 1944, with an idea for a
stage musical based on the life of Edvard Grieg, using the
composer's own melodies. The idea became ``Song of Norway.'' It was
a big success for Lester in California, and he brought it to New
York where it ran for over two years.
   Lester also was responsible for ``Kismet,'' the team's other big
New York hit. This musical, a sort of Broadway meets the Arabian
Nights, won them a Tony Award in 1954. Besides ``Stranger in
Paradise'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' the songs included
``This Is My Beloved'' and ``Rhymes Have I.''
   The musical version of ``Grand Hotel'' has had a 20-year
history. It began in 1958 with Luther Davis who adapted the book
for the great Yiddish comedian Menasha Skulnik. It was called ``At
the Grand.''
   But by th time the musical went into production, it starred Paul
Muni and Joan Diener. Muni got sick, and the musical never got
beyond tryouts in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   Two years ago, Davis resurrected the idea and took it to Wright
and Forrest.
   He told them, ``I would like to start all over again and really
do Vicki Baum's novel,'' Wright recalls. ``Our other version was
set in Rome and was about movies and opera. We went back to the
original.''
   Wright and Forrest began reworking their score, and Davis
extensively revised the book.
   ``The most important part of a musical is the book, not the
music and lyrics,'' Wright says. ``Once the book tells a story that
is interesting, then the music and lyrics have something to say. Up
until then, they are just songs.''
   ``The book is more important because most of the critics are
literary critics; they are not music critics,'' Forrest adds.
``What they criticize is the book.''
   At ages when most people have been retired for a decade, Wright
and Forrest keep writing.
   They are revising ``The Anastasia Game,'' a new version of their
1965 musical ``Anya,'' which recently had a production in
Massachusetts, and working on ``Uncle Daniel,'' a musical based on
the Eudora Welty novella ``The Ponder Heart.''
   ``You can't stop working,'' Wright says.
   ``Besides, most of our working consists of sitting and
thinking,'' Forrest adds. ``You sit and you wish.''

   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines
visits the United States this week in hopes of attracting more
trade and investment to her country and improving conditions for
her 60 million people. Here is a report on the state of the nation
she has led since 1986.

<TEXT>
   Nearly four years ago, Corazon Aquino
stood before television cameras and proclaimed that a ``dark night
of tyranny'' had come to an end in the Philippines.
   Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, had been driven into
exile in Hawaii by the ``people power revolution'' that brought
Mrs. Aquino to power.
   The ``night of tyranny'' she referred to in taking her oath as
president on Feb. 25, 1986, may have ended, but poverty,
insurgency, crime and social inequities remain.
   Mrs. Aquino arrives in the United States on Tuesday, after
visiting Canada, in search of more trade and investment in the
Philippines to cope with those problems at home. From Vancouver,
Toronto and Ottawa in Canada, she is scheduled to visit New York,
Washington for a meeting with President Bush, and Dallas, before
heading home via either Los Angeles or San Francisco. She'll confer
with businessmen in New York and Dallas.
   But the struggle to deal with economic problems, armed
insurgencies and coup attempts has sapped the euphoria and
political vitality that in 1986 drove Marcos to Hawaii, where he
died Sept. 22 at the age of 72, and vaulted Mrs. Aquino to the
office that many thought should have been her husband's.
   It was the assassination of the husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino
Jr., on Aug. 21, 1983, that set off the chain of events that led to
the ``people power revolution'' in the Philippines.
   Aquino, who had been imprisoned by Marcos for seven years before
being allowed to leave for exile in the United States, was
returning home that August day to challenge Marcos; he was shot to
death as he stepped off a plane at Manila's airport.
   But today in Corazon Aquino's Philippines, a feeling persists
that nothing has changed since the Marcos years.
   Recently, the Social Weather Stations polling service said only
35 percent of 300 Manilans surveyed were satisfied with Mrs.
Aquino, down from a high of 77 percent two years ago.
   ``There is a growing number of people who are dissatisfied with
her,'' said Rev. Joaquin Bernas, president of Ateneo University and
an Aquino supporter. ``Satisfaction is going down steadily. Halfway
in her fourth year she has not rebounded.''
   Inflation today is 12 percent. Allegations of corruption abound.
   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, the Roman Catholic archbishop and the
nation's leading churchman, often comments that Filipinos rid
themselves of ``Ali Baba, but the 40 thieves remain.'' By Ali Baba
he means Marcos.
   ``Because of poverty and lack of education, people end up being
victims of injustice,'' said Luis Villafuerte, chairman of the
Governors League of the Philippines. ``If you cannot improve that
situation, you can say you have a democracy, you have elections,
you have a Congress, but it means nothing to people who are poor
and suffering.''
   Human rights abuses continue, as do killings by Communist
insurgents. The killings include the assassination in April of Col.
James Rowe of the U.S. Army and the slayings of two other Americans
in September.
   Ordinary Filipinos are threatened by rising crime, much of it
committed by police and soldiers, including car thefts, murders and
bank robberies. Police say the crime rate has increased by 6.5
percent since Mrs. Aquino took office.
   For the first six months of this year, the monthly crime index
stood at 20.17 incidents per 100,000 people. More than 15 percent
of the nation's 72,730 recorded crimes occurred in greater Manila.
   The Social Weather Stations survey said 25 percent of the 300
Manila residents polled reported they had been victims of crime.
   But no groundswell of opposition appears to be building against
Mrs. Aquino, known affectionately as Cory.
   Attempts by the left and right to organize huge street
demonstrations have largely fizzled. Filipinos appear more
concerned with the struggle for a decent living.
   But there is a feeling Mrs. Aquino might be missing a historic
opportunity to transform the Philippines into a model of
progressive Asian democracy.
   Mrs. Aquino can point to significant accomplishments. She has
restored democratic institutions, unshackled the press and held
back Communist and Moslem insurgents.
   The economy has grown steadily and is expected to increase by
about 6 percent this year. But economic gains have mostly
benefitted upper middle class entrepreneurs with little filtering
down to the masses.
   Government figures indicate the lowest third of society controls
only 9 percent of the national income, virtually the same as under
Marcos. Millions subsist on incomes barely adequate for food and
lodging.

   Among those millions is Aurora Mendoza, who supports an
unemployed husband and two children on a monthly salary of 1,543
pesos ($73.50) as a clerk in the Education Department.
   Her expenses average about 2,925 pesos ($139.30) a month, she
said. She makes up the difference by borrowing money from
colleagues. Others like her supplement their salaries by selling
home-grown foods or other items to fellow office workers.
   In Manila, wealthy Filipinos live in spacious homes in plush,
well-guarded ``villages.'' But government figures indicate that
Filipinos in 25 of the 73 provinces receive few state services.
   In Sulu, a largely Moslem province 600 miles south of Manila,
133 of every 1,000 infants die before their first birthday. Life
expectancy for males in Basilan province is 52.9 years _ 10 years
years below the national average.
   ``There is always the expectation of better things,'' Mrs.
Aquino said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ``And
there have been better things. But I suppose what people would like
is for all these good things to happen yesterday.''
   Mrs. Aquino, who is American-educated and a member of a wealthy
family, did not set out to recast Philippine society but to restore
the institutions that the Marcos years had destroyed or corrupted.
   Hers was to be an ``institutional revolution,'' the success or
failure of which would show whether U.S.-style democracy can work
in a poor country.
   But those values were imposed on an Asian society in which
family ties, paternalism and respect for authority sometimes lead
to nepotism, corruption and entrenched ``warlord'' families.
   Longtime colonial domination _ first by Spaniards, then by
Americans _ established a tradition of armed struggle such as the
20-year-old Communist insurgency and the Moslem revolt that flares
and subsides.
   Colonialism also produced a class of landed elite, which
prospered through war, revolution, dictatorship and democracy. Many
of the old families _ the Laurels, the Lopezes, the Cojuangcos, the
Aquinos _ were at the forefront of the anti-Marcos campaign.
   Early in her administration, Mrs. Aquino tried to pursue
reformist goals. Her fledgling steps faltered with the rise of
military influence and the re-emergence of powerful political clans.
   Mrs. Aquino freed 300 political prisoners and offered peace
talks to Communist and Moslem rebels. Her first human rights
commissioner, the late Jose Diokno, promised to prosecute soldiers
for human rights abuses committed under Marcos.
   The peace talks with the rebels failed. But the overtures and
the threat of prosecution alarmed the military, setting the stage
for the six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
   The coups failed because of the loyalty of Gen. Fidel Ramos, the
chief of staff and now the defense secretary. But military
influence increased, and most liberals were dropped from Mrs.
Aquino's Cabinet. Talk of human rights trials and reconciliation
with rebels ended.
   Early in her administration, Mrs. Aquino fired all officials
elected under Marcos and appointed ``officers-in-charge.'' That led
to turmoil in local administrations and a rift in the ruling
coalition after factions claimed they were shortchanged in
appointments.
   To end the turmoil, Mrs. Aquino's allies struck agreements with
many former Marcos supporters in the May 1987 congressional
elections and the regional balloting in January 1988.
   That enabled representatives of more than 30 ``warlord''
families to regain power.
   The influence of traditional politicians in Congress slowed
reform. Land reform languished in Congress nearly a year before
emerging with so many pro-landlord loopholes that the agrarian
reform secretary, Miriam Defensor Santiago, fears it will be
unworkable.

   THE LAND _ The Philippines is a tropical archipelago of 7,100
islands about 500 miles east of the Asian mainland, but its actual
land area is about the size of Arizona. Only 7 percent of the
islands are larger than one square mile and two-thirds are unnamed.
The largest islands are Luzon, which includes Manila, and Mindanao
in the south.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The 60 million Filipinos are mostly of Malay ethnic
stock with mixtures of Chinese, Spanish, Arab, American and other
European ancestry. They are descendants of Malays who began
arriving in the islands about 2,000 years ago from what are now
Indonesia and Malaysia. About 85 percent are Roman Catholic. The
rest include Protestants, Moslems and adherents of tribal
religions. English and Filipino, a Malay language based on Tagalog,
are the official languages. But more than 80 other languages and
dialects also are spoken.

<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ Corazon Aquino took office as president on Feb.
25, 1986, after a popular uprising toppled Ferdinand E. Marcos and
forced him into exile in Hawaii. Mrs. Aquino restored the
U.S.-style bicameral legislature, which Marcos had abolished.
Elections for the Senate and House of Representatives were held in
May 1987 and balloting for regional officials took place the
following January.

<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ Negritos migrated from Asia over a land bridge
thousands of years ago. When the Portugese explorer Ferdinand
Magellan reached the islands in 1521, he found descendants of Malay
people who began arriving about 2,000 years ago. A Spanish
expedition returned 21 years later and named the islands for King
Philip II of Spain. The Spanish ruled until the Americans seized
the islands in 1898 in the Spanish-American War. Japan invaded the
Philippines in 1941, defeating a joint U.S.-Filipino force. Gen.
Douglas MacArthur returned with a U.S. invasion force in October
1944 and recaptured Manila in February 1945. Full independence from
the United States was granted on July 4, 1946. Marcos declared
martial law in 1972 and lifted it Jan. 17, 1981. But he retained
vast powers until he was ousted in 1986.

   After winning a battle to ban ivory,
conservationists now face all-out war: rescuing a vast range of
animal and plant species far less imposing than the elephant.
   At stake are fast-rising wildlife exports worth more than $130
billion a year on the world's retail markets, according to
specialists.
   Two-thirds of the trade is legal, defended by well-organized
associations and by governments. The rest is contraband, via
networks of poachers and smugglers often involved in drugs or arms
as well.
   While sympathy can be whipped up over rhinos and leopards, less
noble life forms suffer unnoticed, environmentalists say.
   At a recent United Nations meeting in which elephants dominated
discussions, lonely lobbyists pleaded for a delicate flower, the
Turkish snowdrop, which is exported by the millions with unknown
implications.
   Scientists warn that unless they can assemble more data and
muster public opinion, valuable species will plummet toward
extinction during the coming decade.
   ``We have very little idea of the size of many populations,''
said David Western, a Kenyan biologist who is the director of
research for Wildlife Conservation International in New York. ``It
is a critical problem.''
   When Guyana's caimans came up at the U.N. meeting, Guyanese
authorities had to admit they had no idea how many of the scarce
crocodilians still lived along their rivers.
   The beautiful brilliant green Manus tree snail, prized among
mollusk fans, is earning badly needed revenue for Papua-New Guinea,
but no one knows how many can be safely sold.
   ``Most countries just don't have the resources to find out what
they have,'' said Western.
   The 103-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species, which adopted the ivory ban, regulates trade, but its
small staff relies on outside data and enforcement.
   If experts cannot agree that a species belongs on the
``endangered'' list, it is regarded as ``threatened'' and may be
traded under license.
   ``When a species is listed as threatened, prices soar,'' said
Craig Van Note of Monitor Consortium, a Washington-based network of
U.S. and international environmental groups.
   ``Everything that starts on the threatened list ends up
endangered,'' he said. ``Vested interests push trade for all it's
worth. This is big money, and we are finding the same mafias that
handle drugs also dealing in wildlife.''
   Until enough scientific evidence is gathered, species are not on
either list, and trade is determined mainly by the open market.
   About 350 million tropical fish were sold last year, causing
unknown depletions. In 14 years, France alone imported 1 billion
frog legs from South Asia.
   ``We desperately need more data,'' said Ginette Hemley, U.S.
head of Traffic, a monitoring agency supported by the World
Wildlife Fund. ``We have to raise major money. The onus is on us.''
   She noted burgeoning demands for wildlife products in newly
affluent nations.
   ``It's booming in Asia, and consumption is increasing
everywhere,'' she said. ``The trend is just beginning.''
   One Asian nation, Thailand, has been branded by wildlife groups
as one of the world's worst exploiters of wildlife.
   Unless ways can be found to bring exports into line with species
populations, conservationists will have to push for a total ban on
trade within five years, Ms. Hemley said.
   Traffic focuses on 30 species, mostly reptiles and birds, which
are particularly endangered. Smugglers are increasingly cunning,
with substantial resources for bribery and subterfuge.
   In the United States, Fish and Wildlife Service agents found
$3.5 million worth of narcotics last year during searches. That
included heroin in condoms stuffed into banned snakes and cocaine
stashed in polar bear hides.
   The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and
specialist teams keep tabs on wildlife, but arguments can be heated
when export earnings are at risk.
   Counting small fish in big ponds, or rare birds in remote
forests, involves substantial guesswork. In some countries, local
authorities accept bribes to skew data, wildlife experts say.
   Even with the obtrusive African elephant, tracked from the air
and on the ground by experienced scientists, wide discord persists
over census estimates.
   The accepted figure is 625,000, the findings of a recent
extensive survey. Iain Douglas-Hamilton of Kenya, an experienced
counter who took part in the survey, prefers 609,000.
   Some specialists in Zimbabwe and South Africa, who fought hard
against an ivory ban to allow culling from their controlled herds,
put the number near a million.
   But Pierre Pfeffer of the Museum of Natural History in Paris,
who has surveyed Central African forests, puts the total at
400,000. He says East African experts overestimate forest herds.
   Conservationists acknowledge the ivory victory was easier
because the elephant falls into what they call the spotted-cat
category. Most vulnerable species are in the rhino category.
   Ivory, like spotted cat fur, is valued for its visibility and
can be driven out of fashion with negative publicity. Rhino horn,
however, is valuable when ground up into unrecognizable powder.
   Only experts recognize many rare birds, reptiles and fish, and
consumers continue to buy them. Primates sold for research are not
vulnerable to fashion trends.
   Scientists say curbing harmful trade is especially important now
because wildlife is under serious threat from habitat destruction
in most of parts of the world.
   The World Resources Institute, along with the U.N. Environment
Program and the World Conservation Union, launched a major campaign
to preserve biodiversity, the vital interplay of species in nature.
   One-fourth of the world's plants and animals face extinction
within 25 to 50 years if losses continue at the present rate, the
institute said.
   ``The impact of such losses on human well-being is potentially
devastating,'' said the institute's president, James Gustave Speth.
``No longer is it acceptable to merely slow the rate of
destruction.''
   But conservationists contend international mechanisms are far
too lax to control trade.
   In one recent case, British police arrested a notorious smuggler
known as the ``Raider of the Orchid.'' He served six weeks in jail
and paid a fine of $4,200.
   New Scientist magazine said of the case: ``Dealers in rare
plants must be laughing all the way back to the jungle ... and the
cause of conservation has been set back decades.''
   At the recent endangered species meeting, environmentalist
groups accused Secretary-General Eugene Lapointe of conflict of
interest for financing CITES' ivory unit with contributions from
ivory traders.
   Earlier, Van Note testified in the U.S. Congress that CITES was
failing in its mission because of ``underfunding, inadequate
staffing and poor management.''
   Lapointe denied any wrongdoing but agreed CITES was hamstrung by
scant resources and faulty data from some member governments.
Infraction reports catalog widespread flouting of international
guidelines.
   Opening the CITES session Oct. 9, Prince Bernhard of the
Netherlands, a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, criticized
global efforts to control trade.
   He won applause by declaring: ``If there is any doubt ... on any
issue ... you must give the benefit of the doubt to the survival of
the species. Don't forget, once a species has gone, it has gone
forever.''

   Wildlife groups say Thailand is
decimating its own once teeming species and those of other nations
through bear-feast tours for Koreans, caiman skin smuggling and the
``Polish Connection.''
   The Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund for Nature and other
environmental groups cite numerous examples of wanton destruction:
   _South Koreans fly to Thailand on organized tours to feast on
bear meat, which they believe enhances vigor and strength,
according to Phisit na Phattlung, the Wildlife Fund's head in
Thailand.
   _Thailand was the major link in an operation to illegally
smuggle about 120,000 skins of South American caiman alligators to
Japan last year.
   _The International Primate Protection League charges that Thai
traders fake permits to send white-handed gibbons and other
protected species to zoos in Poland. Lacking funds, the Poles
obtain the animals on credit, keep about a third of them and sell
the rest to Western zoos.
   The Wildlife Fund has recently singled out Thailand and three
other nations _ Indonesia, Spain and Argentina _ as blatant
violators of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Thailand is a party to the 1975
convention, which seeks to halt an illegal worldwide trade valued
at some $5 billion each year.
   Frequently cited as reasons for Thailand's poor conservation
record are its wildly capitalist economy, widespread corruption,
poverty in rural areas and inadequate wildlife legislation.
   A yawning legal loophole allows the export of even endangered
animals from other than domestic sources, Phisit notes. Thus Thai
traders obtain wild animals from nearby Laos, Burma and Cambodia or
produce fake documents to show that animals captured in Thailand
came from these countries. This loophole facilitates smuggling
connections from South America, Africa, Australia and other parts
of Asia.
   Once a tropical wonderland, Thailand has ravaged its own forests
and their once richly varied inhabitants.
   ``Everything is for sale,'' said Phisit, who has monitored
wildlife exploitation for two decades.
   Elephants, tigers, wild cattle and deer are poached in national
parks. Rare wild orchids are plucked for unregulated export. Cobras
are slaughtered by the thousands for their skins, meat and the
purported medicinal power of their gall bladders. Eagles, hawks and
other birds of prey are sold to visiting Arab falconers.
   Stress, poor food and lack of knowledge about animal care take
their toll during and after capture. In snaring baby gibbons and
other primates, for example, the mothers are normally shot by
hunters.
   Further loss of life occurs during overseas shipment when the
animals are often drugged and smuggled in airless boxes, false
bottoms of containers and empty oil drums.
   This year only seven of 114 slow lorises _ small, large-eyed
lemurs _ survived a journey via forged export documents from
Thailand to Japan.
   ``People have been buying and selling animals for centuries,''
Phisit told a group of journalists recently. ``It's the cruelty and
loss of life along the way that we are against.''
   Phisit and other conservationists also assail what they call the
lackluster performance of Thai authorities who in turn complain of
inadequate resources and little legal power to move against the
traffickers.
   Vendors in areas frequented by foreign tourists try to sell slow
lorises sometimes drugged with paint thinner to render them
submissive, or gibbons whose teeth have been chipped to prevent
possible bites.
   A local newspaper recently interviewed a dealer who explained
how some gibbons are decapitated while still alive and their heads
preserved for sale as souvenirs at Bangkok's Weekend Market, where
wildlife is frequently on display on Saturdays and Sundays.
   ``There are posters at the market asking people to telephone the
Wildlife Department if they see wildlife traded,'' Phisit said.
``But you can call until you drop dead because it's Sunday and
nobody works in the office.''

   Events in China, which roused the world to a
frenzy of outrage in June, seem more recently to have lulled it to
sleep.
   What was once high drama on television has dwindled to a daily
grind of repression and arrests since the bold ``democracy
movement'' in Beijing's Tiananmen Square was snuffed out in blood.
   But what happened to the horror that swept the world in June?
Where are the tens of thousands of expatriate Chinese students and
sympathizers who joined in strident protest? And beyond the mild
sanctions announced months ago, where are the threatened boycotts,
the embargoes?
   On Oct. 1, only about 3,500 people joined fugitives from the
Chinese democracy movement for a demonstration in Washington to
counter the regime's 40th anniversary celebration. Organizers had
hoped to draw nearly 10 times that many.
   Other disturbances of global impact _ such as the 1979 Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan or the '76 Soweto massacre in South Africa
_ provoked lasting reaction from the West, either by arousing Cold
War passions or prompting endless demonstrations on college
campuses.
   Yet the world seems to do little more than frown at China while
its hard-line Communist government zealously smothers human rights.
   ``All the great intentions about making China realize the cost
of oppression have faded,'' said Sidney Jones, executive director
of Asia Watch, a human rights committee in New York.
   ``The Western European governments, the U.S. and Japan ... none
has said China has to lift martial law in Beijing before we'll lift
the freeze on World Bank loans. No one has said anyone involved in
the violence must resign before we resume high level contacts.''
   China watchers point to several reasons for the muted response:
   _Foreign governments do not want to disturb China's tentative
orientation toward the West, so carefully nurtured since the Nixon
years.
   _The Cold War has faded, and with it fears of communist excesses.
   _China activists suffered a sharp emotional letdown after seeing
their hopes crushed so abruptly; they recognize, bleakly, the
current regime is just continuing that country's age-old habit of
dictatorial repression.
   _The number of Americans and other Westerners involved with
China, whether economically or politically, is still small. Only
since U.S. diplomatic relations were resumed in 1979 have firm ties
been established after years of alienation.
   But the simplest reason may be out of sight, out of mind. With
dozens of arrests and at least 12 executions over the summer, the
Chinese government apparently has succeeded in extinguishing the
democracy movement _ or at least driving it underground.
   ``There's no one to carry the torch,'' said Jonathan D. Spence,
a China scholar at Yale University. ``If there was some kind of
opposition in China like the unions or the church in Eastern
Europe, they could carry the story.''
   Foreign news media, getting scant information from frightened
Chinese sources, have largely dropped China to the back pages. In
its place are more exciting _ and visible _ developments in Eastern
Europe and Latin America.
   ``The Chinese government has really done a very good job of
managing the story,'' said Barry Naughton, a China expert at the
School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at the
University of California, San Diego.
   ``In particular they have carefully avoided any sensational
event that could be a rallying cry. There is an ambiguity about it.
   ``They have begun to carry out a policy of systematic limitation
on intellectual freedom. That's a major story but they do it in a
way that is incremental. They're nickle and diming it.''
   That strategy suffered a minor setback Oct. 5 when the 1989
Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader
of Tibet, for his non-violent struggle to free his country from
China's occupation. It was a glancing commentary on Tiananmen
Square.
   But there may be deeper reasons why the emotions stirred by the
deaths of hundreds, perhaps thousands of Chinese on June 3-4 now
seem stilled.
   In some ways, the times are not ripe for outrage. The Cold War
has ebbed; some say ended. With it has gone the fear of communism
that aroused the right-wing ``China Lobby'' of the 1950s and
lingered long enough to prompt President Carter's grain embargo and
boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
   Instead, today's news is filled with smiling Soviet leaders and
widening gaps in the Iron Curtain. A poll published by Business
Week magazine in August found that, by a 3-to-1 margin, Americans
are more concerned by the economic threat from Japan than the
military threat from the Soviet Union.
   Economics, indeed, seems to be replacing ideology as the driving
force behind East-West relations, blurring distinctions. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union has staked his future on
it. So apparently have China's leaders, despite the lurch back into
totalitarianism.
   ``The burden of China relations has to some extent fallen on
businessmen, who are not exactly altruists,'' commented Robert F.
Dernberger, a China specialist at the University of Michigan.
   For the record, Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin
opened celebrations marking the regime's 40th anniversary with a
blast of Cold War rhetoric. He condemned the West's ``rotten
lifestyles'' and predicted the triumph of socialism over capitalism.

   But in other forums Chinese officials have quietly mollified the
West, harking back to the pre-Tiananmen Square line that China
needs many years of capitalist-type development before it can
succeed at socialism.
   The governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, told the
annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in
Washington on Sept. 27 that despite setbacks, its policy of
economic reform and opening to the outside world ``shall never be
altered.''
   In corporate boardrooms worldwide, executives still tantalized
by China's 1 billion consumers have been quick to respond,
restaffing long-established joint ventures there.
   ``Virtually all representatives from foreign businesses have
been back from Aug. 15 on,''said Chuck Conroy, who directs Asian
practices for Baker &amp; McKenzie, the world's largest law firm and
one of the first to establish a presence in China.
   Widespread speculation of a drop in agricultural trade has
proved unfounded. Helped by strong business since Tiananmen Square,
commodity sales to China, mostly cotton and wheat, are expected to
be around $1.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, more
than double the previous year.
   In addition, World Bank President Barber Conable said recently
he hoped to resume lending to China soon. Seven loans totaling
nearly $800 million were suspended after the Tiananmen Square
confrontation.
   Most foreign companies are still quietly tabling proposals to
send new capital and personnel into China. But like Conable, they
have only economic, not moral, qualms. They are looking for more
signs of stability.
   Even that, and the loss of more than $1 billion in tourism, may
do little to upset relations. Analysts point out that China's
economy was overheated anyway, and the crackdown gives China's
leaders an opportunity to check inflation and excessive growth.
   In Washington and most major foreign capitals, a chill has
settled over relations with China. Many Western governments did not
send representatives to the carefully orchestrated anniversary
celebration.
   Mostly, however, caution reigns.
   ``If the premise is that George Bush hasn't been going out of
his way to make headlines, that's true,'' said a U.S. government
official in Washington who asked not to be identified. Earlier this
fall, the president deflected a reporter's question about China
with a terse ``It's not time for normalcy.''
   The Bush administration barred high-level contacts with Chinese
officials and sales of military equipment after the crackdown, then
fell silent.
   Japan, China's No. 1 trading partner and No. 1 lender, also has
kept most official contacts at a low level and has not opened
negotiations on new developmental loans. Few Japanese businesses
are launching new projects.
   ``We are also very cautious'' in dealing with already-agreed
loans to China, ``because we do not want to give the impression
that we condone now what we criticized before,'' said Taizo
Watanabe, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry.
   Yet, ``in the hotels in Beijing all you see are Japanese
businessmen,'' said Dernberger, who recently visited China.
``They've already changed and gone back to business as usual.''
   For most Westerners, however, business as usual means having
little to do with China, and this may be another reason for the
tepid response to Tiananmen Square.
   ``I think there's less concern for human rights in China than in
South Africa or in Latin America,'' said Spence.
   ``It might be due to the racial consciousness in the United
States. We can identify with South Africa. It might be due to a
longstanding historical condition that the Chinese are not
permitted such freedom by their governments. ... What was exciting
was the struggle to be free.''
   Those who recognize that most poignantly, perhaps, are the
thousands of expatriate Chinese students who protested on college
campuses in June. Today, many of them are silent as well, fearful
of retaliation against family and friends in China _ and of their
own futures.
   ``In June students were furious about that kind of massacre. It
was very emotional. They had to speak out,'' said Lian Chao Han,
vice president of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students
and Scholars in Washington.
   ``After they cooled down, they really thought that they don't
want to harm their families,'' he said. ``Right now ... they don't
know what they're going to do.''

   The home of a witness's mother is firebombed.
An informant is shot after being accidentally exposed by the
prosecution. A judge worries about jurors' safety so much he
debates having them wear masks in court.
   Small wonder this trial is being conducted behind bullet-proof
plastic 1{ inches thick.
   The chief actor in this real-life script is 24-year-old Rayful
Edmond III who, according to prosecutors, was president and chief
executive officer of ``one of the largest business enterprises in
the Washington, D.C., area.''
   Edmond is alleged by the government to have run the largest
cocaine ring in the history of the District of Columbia: $2 million
a week, 70 pounds of cocaine a month, 30 killings along the way.
   The supporting cast includes Edmond's mother, several brothers,
brothers-in-law and his grandmother, whose home allegedly was
headquarters for the enterprise and who has become a fixture on
evening news shows with remarks as flamboyant as the trademark hats
she wears.
   Edmond borrowed techniques from Fortune 500 companies, according
to prosecutors: He offered good pay _ $500 a week minimum _
expensive cars, a company attorney, help in purchasing real estate,
lavish trips and clothes and jewelry. There were all-expenses paid
trips to the Super Bowl and to heavyweight championship fights in
Las Vegas. His payroll swelled once to 150 people.
   He operated, the government says, the hottest drug market in the
city on two narrow tree-lined blocks in northeast Washington known
as ``The Strip.'' At peak hours, cars would be bumper-to-bumper
waiting for young street sellers to bring plastic bags of cocaine
for $50 apiece.
   The trial, which began Sept. 11, has become something of a
sensation in Washington, much like the Oliver North case that
unfolded two floors down earlier in the year and the John Hinckley
trial that took place two floors above.
   Security was tight for those cases, but nothing like the Edmond
trial. The jurors are anonymous _ even to the judge and lawyers _
and are identified only by number. Would-be spectators are held
down the hall and summoned one-by-one to go through metal detectors.
   U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey declared in a memorandum
that there was a ``substantial likelihood of imminent danger to the
safety of the parties, witnesses, and other persons.'' Suspecting
the gang was trying to identify individual jurors, he tried to
close the trial to the public, leaving only reporters, but was
thwarted by an appeals court.
   In court, Edmond and his 10 co-defendants are matched one-on-one
by U.S. marshals. Add to that a dozen defense lawyers, four or five
for the government, the 12 jurors and three alternates, court
clerks and stenographer and the court takes on the appearance of a
Roman Forum. There are too many lawyers to crowd at the bench for
conferences; instead, they listen through wireless headphones.
   The 11 are charged variously with cocaine distribution,
conspiracy and racketeering. For Edmond, there is an additional
charge punishable by life in prison without parole _ carrying on a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Edmond also is scheduled for trial, along with three other
alleged gang members, on three first-degree murder charges. And
there will be a third proceeding for others charged with
conspiracy, swelling the number of defendants to 24.
   Despite the security precautions, Richey's court had to be
emptied once because of a bomb threat. Remote-control video cameras
scan the well of the court and the spectator seats. The judge often
has armed escorts from home to court.
   The chief defense lawyer, William H. Murphy Jr., wrangles
constantly with the judge and the government's lead lawyer,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Betty Ann Soiefer.
   During a shouting match, Ms. Soiefer elbowed Murphy away from
the lectern. He, in turn, likened her to football player William
``the Refrigerator'' Perry and demanded an apology. The judge said
he had not seen anything wrong with the prosecutor's conduct.
   The trial began with six alternate jurors; it now has only
three. One was dismissed earlier this month after it became clear
his identity had become known to defense attorneys, another because
of family hardship and the third after she allegedly told other
jurors she believed all of the defendants are innocent.
   There have been violent incidents. In March, prosecutors by
mistake mailed a letter to the home of a key informant, detailing
her cooperation and warning her life might be in danger. The
witness was sharing her home with Edmond's brother, Emanuel Sutton,
a defendant in the trial.
   A week later, the informant, Deborah Y. Phillips, was shot in
the leg. A month later, she was found by her mother with her mouth
taped shut and suffering from an apparent drug overdose. Since then
she has refused to testify, citing her rights against
self-incrimination.
   In her grand jury testimony, she had described counting money
for the organization, paying salaries to the workers and preparing
drugs for street sale. She said she regularly turned over shoeboxes
of money to Edmond, often as much as $60,000 a box.
   The trial was three weeks old when a Molotov cocktail was thrown
into the home of the mother of Kathy Sellers, a government witness
on the stand at that time. Nobody was hurt, but U.S. Attorney Jay
B. Stephens said all witnesses would be offered police protection.
   Testimony has proved no less sensational than the theatrics
surrounding the trial.
   Ms. Sellers testified she once watched Constance Perry _
Edmond's mother _ use a money-counting machine on thousands of
dollars at the home of one of Edmond's sisters. Both mother and
sister are under indictment.
   Drug agent John Cornille was surrounded on the stand by so many
stacks of cocaine seized during the arrest of one defendant that he
was almost blocked from view.
   Alta Rae Zanville told of visiting the apartment of defendant
Tony Lewis and finding so much money stacked on the floor that it
did not fit into three pieces of luggage. ``I would venture to say
it was about $3 million,'' she said.
   Stevenson McArthur, a 20-year-old serving a prison term for
dealing, testified he owned seven cars when he was 17.
   He became acquainted with Edmond outside a convenience store
when he asked about the black Mercedes-Benz that Edmond was
driving. Asked how he knew the car was worth $80,000, McArthur
replied: ``I had one of my own.''

   Terra-cotta works created by artists a millennium ago are
featured in a new exhibit, ``Icons: Ideals and Power in the Art of
Africa,'' at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in
Washington.
   The exhibition of 125 sculptures, watercolors, oils, etchings
and banners explores the various ways in which various African
societies and civilizations have viewed the icons of mother and
child, male and female, the male, the rider, and the stranger.
   ``Unlike European religious icons that focused on Christian
imagery, these five African symbols represent powerful, shared
cultural ideals and values central to the lives of African
peoples,'' said Andrea Nicholls, assistant curator. ``The ideals
are embodied in the images as attributes of physical beauty, power
or accomplishment in the social, political, religious or economic
realm.''
   The exhibit includes a pair of Yoruba palace doors by the
sculptor Areogun with images of a king and his wives, bicyclists,
colonial clerks, soldiers and equestrians to reflect late 19th
-century Yoruba life.
   ``Icons'' opened Oct. 25 and will run through Sept. 3, 1990.
   Here is a list of other current shows this season at some

<HEAD>The Artists: Upstaging at the Met</HEAD>

   In the Metropolitan Opera's new production of
``Rigoletto,'' the title role is sung by Leo Nucci, the Duke is
Luciano Pavarotti and soprano June Anderson makes a much
anticipated Met debut as Gilda.
   But Nucci's not worried about being upstaged. ``When you have a
great cast and a great conductor, we perform much better,'' he says.
   The Italian baritone was one of the top stars of the Met last
season, acclaimed as Figaro in ``The Barber of Seville'' and in
``Rigoletto,'' ``Madama Butterfly'' and ``The Elixir of Love.''
   He gave the Met four months which, he says with a smile, he
probably won't do again. Nucci is in demand in opera houses all
over the world. He started this season singing in Vienna and
Hamburg. He'll be at the Met for only ``Rigoletto,'' the first
seven performances of nine during November and two in February. In
January he'll sing the role in Houston.
   During Nucci's fall engagement here, he'll sing the 1,000th
performance of his career and his 100th Rigoletto.
   Five recordings on London Records will come out this season:
``The Barber of Seville,'' ``Rigoletto,'' ``Simon Boccanegra,''
``Aida'' and a solo record of Italian songs. ``A Masked Ball,'' the
last recording conducted by Herbert von Karajan, was released by
Deutsche Grammaphon in August while Nucci was singing in that opera
at the Salzburg Festival.
   Nucci, interviewed in his manager's office, said his early
career progressed in an unusual way. His opera debut was in 1967 in
the title role of ``The Barber of Seville'' in Spoleto, Italy.
   ``After three years, I am stopping the career. I was then in the
chorus at La Scala five years. Why I don't know. Don't ask me why.
Because of life. Many things. Things weren't going so well.
Thinking about the voice technique,'' he said.
   ``When I did my audition for the chorus, the chorus maestro
said, `You're sure you come to the chorus?' I said, `I'm sure. I
need the money for eating.' I never lost the habit of eating. This
is a big problem.
   ``I started again to study. I find in Milano a teacher; he was
85 at the time. I was with this old man until he died at 90 years
old. In 1973, I made another debut, in Lonigo, a very small city.
At the same time I was in the chorus at La Scala. In 1975 I take
another important decision, with my wife and family. I left the
chorus.''
   He dates his career from that time. ``I'm glad and I'm very
lucky. To stop the career and try again is not so easy.''
   Another good thing happened during Nucci's stint in the chorus.
``I find my wife. She is a soloist, soprano. She listened to me
sing a song, a very romantic song. She fell in love. I was already
in love, to sing the song. We married in 1972.''
   Nucci sang his first Rigoletto with his wife, Adriana, who was
six months' pregnant, in Lonigo. ``She also sang in San Francisco
and Covent Garden. She is retired now.
   ``My daughter, Cinzia, Cynthia in English, is 16. She tries to
be a soprano but it's too early to know about this.''
   Nucci's big break came in 1978, singing in ``Luisa Miller'' at
Covent Garden with Pavarotti and Katia Ricciarelli. ``The baritone
canceled in a new, very important production conducted by Lorin
Maazel. Katia said my name for replacing him. She called: `Is it
possible you can come to London? We have tomorrow the final dress
rehearsal. You can sing very well this role. What you say?' My
answer was, `Yes, I can.' It was the best thing in my life as a
singer.''
   He had sung in Italy, debuting at La Scala in 1977, and in small
houses, once with Ricciarelli, and in Spain, but wasn't known on
the international scene. ``This was the dream of everyone starting
a career.''
   Getting the costume altered wasn't difficult, Nucci says.
Performing after only one rehearsal was.
   Was it a success? Nucci smiles.
   ``The day after, I received in my hotel 10 or more telegrams,
from the Met, Chicago, Washington, Vienna, Paris. It is incredible;
this is a miracle,'' he said. ``After my first act aria and
cabaletta, all I remember is the curtain coming down. I remember
I'm crying.
   ``Luciano, after the first act, I can't forget, patted my
shoulder and said, `My young boy, you did tonight in one night what
we did in five years.' After that, Luciano calls me `champion'
instead of Leo. He still says it.''
   And what does Nucci call Pavarotti? ```Maestro.' He is the No.
1.''
   Nucci made his debut in Vienna in 1979, in Washington and the
Met in 1980, Chicago and Paris in 1981, San Francisco in 1984. Now
he's being booked into 1994.
   He won't be at the Met next season. In 1991, he'll do ``A Masked
Ball'' and ``Luisa Miller.'' In 1992 he'll sing ``Rigoletto.''
   Nucci described the character Rigoletto.
   ``He does insults because they entertain the Duke,'' he said.
``It is just a job. He doesn't like this job. He does it because
he's a hunchback. In that time, dwarfs were entertainment for the
rich.
   ``Three years ago, there was a big scandal in Hamburg. The
director wanted Rigoletto to be a clown. He is not a clown. ... He
is like a piece of wood. He does what he must do, nothing more _ in
my idea. Gilda was in a cage. The court was dressed like fascists.
This is nothing to do with `Rigoletto.' It's not like music of this
century. The time is different. You cannot do `Rigoletto' and
change everything.''

   When Paula Abdul was a child, she dreamed of
following in the footsteps of such singing and dancing legends as
Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Judy Garland.
   Today, it looks as if the diminutive 26-year-old vocalist and
choreographer could be well on her way.
   Abdul's debut album, ``Forever Your Girl,'' has sold more than 2
million copies with three No. 1 singles: ``Straight Up,'' ``Forever
Your Girl'' and ``Cold Hearted.'' A fourth single, ``The Way You
Love Me,'' is also burning up the charts.
   To top it off, she recently won three MTV awards for her music
and videos, and even more recently won an Emmy for her choreography
of ``The Tracey Ullman Show.''
   She is understandably overwhelmed.
   ``I feel redundant when I keep saying, `I'm overwhelmed' or `I'm
excited,' but it's really something you can't explain,'' she said.
``It's just an inner feeling that you have. You smile and you laugh
and you think, `I'm a real lucky girl.'''
   Abdul has come a long way from her days cheerleading for the Los
Angeles Lakers, considering it was an opportunity she almost missed.
   She heard about the audition and went with her girlfriends, but
became discouraged when she saw hundreds of Laker Girl hopefuls
milling about waiting for their chance to perform.
   ``I drove the girls that were auditioning with me so I had to
wait for them. And at the very last second, after hours, I said,
`What the heck, I'm just gonna go ahead.'
   ``I was a big basketball fan,'' she said. ``I was a huge Laker
fan and we each would get two season seats. What more could you
want? The Lakers were really hot.''
   Soon after being selected as one of the 12 cheerleaders in 1981,
the choreographer left to get married. She asked a very young Abdul
to take over the job.
   Like everything she commits herself to, Abdul devoted herself to
getting the Laker Girls noticed. She incorporated traditional
cheerleading with jazzy dance steps and savvy street moves.
   The fans did notice _ and the offers started pouring in for
Abdul to choreograph. She helped smooth out dance steps for a music
video by the Jacksons and did some commercial work. Then she
choreographed the videos for Janet Jackson's ``What Have You Done
for Me Lately?'' and ``When I Think of You,'' among others.
   ``I wasn't looking to become a choreographer really,'' Abdul
said. ``These were little jobs that came my way and it was
something that was good money and it was fun.''
   Besides choreographing videos for Jackson, ZZ Top and the
Pointer sisters, Abdul arranged dance steps for Aretha Franklin,
Kool and the Gang and George Michael concert tours.
   She also choreographed two films, ``The Running Man'' and
``Coming to America.'' She became so busy she had to say goodbye to
the Laker Girls.
   But with the looming examples of Kelly, Garland and Astaire,
Abdul still was drawn to song.
   Abdul laughed as she talked recently about her break into the
recording business. She said the record company executives who
worked with her on music videos kept asking, ``So what do you want
to do when you grow up, Paula?''
   She would respond: ``I want to be an artist on your label.''
   Finally two executives took her seriously and signed her to a
recording deal. ``Forever Your Girl'' was the result.
   ``I remember thinking when I was making the album: `Look, I'm
having a good time doing this but it would be really wonderful if I
really sold albums. It would be wonderful if I had hit songs,'''
she said.
   The album has since produced the three hits, and probably will
generate a few more.
   ``You feel like, `Well gosh, I have a No. 1 single, that's
really great.' Then you have another single that comes out and it
goes No. 1 and you freak out,'' she said. ``I freaked out. I
couldn't believe it. Then you have a third one that goes No. 1 and
you go, `Oh my God! I'm dreaming!'''
   Abdul never expected such quick success when she was a young
girl taking ``hours and hours'' of dancing lessons and dreaming of
Hollywood in her San Fernando Valley neighborhood.
   Her dark good looks come from a Brazilian and Syrian father, and
a French Canadian mother. She said when she was little, her mother
warned her about the perils of show business and urged her to have
another dream.
   Abdul seriously took the advice and went to California State
University, Northridge, where she entered the radio-TV-film program.
   ``I still had a strong love of song and dance and acting, but I
knew in case it never worked for me then I would maybe have a
career as a sports commentator.''
   Unfortunately for the sports world, she never took that career
track _ and now juggles choreography and singing while trying to
find time for herself. After a recent early morning photo shoot,
Abdul admitted she was pressed for time because she had to catch a
plane to Paris.
   ``It gets draining,'' she said. ``When it gets to be a little
bit too much that's when I have to back off, at least for a day,
because I don't want it ever to be tedious. I want to always feel
the way I'm feeling now.''
   She had been scheduled to choreograph the film version of the
musical ``Evita,'' but got a reprieve of the four-month project in
Spain when Meryl Streep dropped out as lead. With that shelved,
Abdul wants to take a week off, then immerse herself in a second
album, which may include some surprises.
   ``Musically, I'm more involved now and I have different ideas of
where I want to go,'' she said. ``I'm not going to deviate too much
from what I've done, with what's been successful for me, but I plan
on stretching a lot.''
   Her success has not stifled her ambition. She eventually wants
to break into acting, much like her Hollywood idols, and is
currently considering several prospects.
   ``I definitely want to act,'' she said. ``But I definitely want
to continue making music and I'll never give up choreography.''

   Vladimir Nabokov liked to write standing up,
waking in the early morning and starting work at a blue lectern. By
the afternoon, the author would be seated in an armchair, a wooden
board across his lap. He usually wrote until bedtime.
   With books taking up most of his day, letters were written only
for specific reasons: business, a line to his publisher or a legal
matter that required his signature.
   There were also notes to his family: passionate letters to his
wife, Vera, when they were apart for a time; messages slipped under
the hotel room door of his son, Dmitri, in Montreaux, Switzerland;
words of encouragement to his brother, Kirill, an aspiring poet.
   Not every writer could be creative at all times, but as Dmitri
Nabokov said in a recent interview, even the most casual memo by
his father was something special, graced by the touch that produced
``Lolita,'' ``The Gift,'' ``Ada'' and many others.
   ``It was a thrill, I loved it,'' recalled Nabokov, 55, who
helped compile ``The Letters of Vladimir Nabokov: 1940-1977''
(Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $29.95).
   ``I knew, that as in his fiction, around the corner of every
sentence there would be a nice little surprise, a linguistic
surprise,'' he said.
   ``Whether he was writing to a publisher, writing to a son,
making up a grocery list _ there was always something original in
how he phrased it. The receptors of my spinal cord were always
ready for his language.''
   Nabokov admits that a certain settling of accounts was in mind
upon issuing his late father's letters. Vladimir Nabakov's stern,
precise image represented just one side, his son insists. Consider
what the author wrote to Vera in May 1937 after his recovery from a
recent illness:
   ``You know _ now I can tell you frankly _ the indescribable
torments in February, before these treatments, drove me to the
border of suicide _ a border I was not authorized to cross because
I had you in my luggage. My love, is it really true that I shall
soon see you _ if fate does not let me down?
   ``Try not to worry too much, my love. We shall be together soon
anyway. Tell Mother I embrace her and am not writing her only
because I am spending all my epistolary energy on you.''
   ``Lolita,'' of course, touched off dozens of letters, ranging
from amusement to anger as frightened publishers suggested changes
or backed away, and governments attempted censorship.
   Nabokov knew his story of a middle-aged man's passionate affair
with a 12-year-old girl would create controversy and this 1950s
best seller became the usually apolitical author's most passionate
cause.
   On March 6, 1956, he wrote to Morris Bishop, chairman of the
Department of Romance Literature at Cornell University, where
Nabokov also taught:
   ``I know that `Lolita' is my best book so far. I calmly lean on
my conviction that it is a serious work of art, and that no court
could prove it to be `lewd and libertine.'
   ``All categories raid, of course, into one another: a comedy of
manners written by a fine poet may have its `lewd' side; but Lolita
is a tragedy. `Pornography' is not an image plucked out of context;
pornography is an attitude and an intention. The tragic and the
obscene exclude each other.''
   Those writers Nabokov found inferior are spared nothing. Poet
T.S. Eliot and author Thomas Mann are dismissed as ``big fakes.''
Nobelist Saul Bellow is ``a mediocrity.'' Poet Ezra Pound is
``disgusting and entirely second-rate.''
   Critic Edmund Wilson, a onetime supporter, feuded openly with
Nabokov. In the 1950s, after many years of a warm friendship, these
two great literary figures drifted apart.
   It started on a professional level, with Nabokov attacking
Wilson's attempts at Russian translation and ended with bitter,
personal attacks in the early 1970s, shortly before the critic's
death.
   ``As you perhaps know, the warm friendship between EW and VN,
which began in 1941, was later obliterated by minor and major
clashes,'' Nabokov would sadly note.
   He preferred the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, spending years
on the English translation of his novel in verse, ``Eugene Onegin.''
   Nabokov also admired James Joyce, whose ``Ulysses'' was labeled
``pornographic'' as well, and Marcel Proust, author of the classic
``Remembrance of Things Past,'' whose gift for intricate detail had
a powerful influence.
   ``Proust was very visual and chromatic in his approach and so
was father,'' Dmitri Nabokov said. ``Father in his youth wanted to
a painter. At the age of 15, he received lessons in the house. He
had talent, but his teacher read the first of my father's attempts
at poetry and prose and said, `You have to a writer, or a poet.'''
   Vladimir Nabokov, the son of a prominent liberal in
pre-revolutionary Russia, was born 1899 in St. Petersburg (now
Leningrad). He read Tolstoy and Turgenev as a child, played chess
and collected butterflies, a lifelong fascination.
   Unhappy with the Bolshevik government, he emigrated in 1919 and
lived in several countries before settling in the United States in
1940. Twenty years later, the author and Vera moved to Switzerland,
where they remained until his death in 1977. Vera Nabokov still
lives in Montreaux.
   ``He was a wonderfully warm guy,'' said Dmitri Nabokov, who
translated several of his father's books. ``He was my best friend,
as is mother. But he was intransigent with bad art and second-hand
ideas. Intransigent with those who mutilated his art. And very,
very jealous with his time.
   ``His time and strength were finite. He felt he had a gift that
he had to utilize to the fullest and he wanted to write. He did not
go on bookstore tours and was very parsimonious in giving
interviews.''
   In 1964, Nabokov did agree to a rare interview, and conducted it
in even rarer style. The reporter filled a stack of paper with
questions and handed them to Nabokov, who walked to his lectern and
composed the answers. Always, his son observed, the author knew how
he best communicated.
   ``In his own words, `I think like a genius, I write like a
distinguished author, I speak like a child.' He also said that he
was a wretched public speaker, which wasn't true. He was a
wonderful speaker, he did a lot of `off-the-Nabokov-uffing,' as he
called it.
   ``He was such a precisionist with language. He felt that
everything he published should be up to the best level or the right
thought.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Award-Winning Career Started in Bathroom</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some groups start as garage bands, bar
bands or studio bands, but Grammy-winning Take 6 began as a
bathroom band.
   The original group of six young students began harmonizing in a
bathroom at Oakwood College, a Seventh-day Adventist school in
Huntsville, Ala., nine years ago.
   ``You always have good acoustics in a bathroom,'' said Claude V.
McKnight III, the group's leader. ``It was a large bathroom and you
have sounds reverberating off the wall. The sound is better as long
as there isn't anyone doing anything that might upset you.''
   From those bathroom rehearsals and several personnel changes
came a jazz-styled, a cappella gospel group that scored a hit with
its first single, ``Spread Love.''
   The single and self-titled debut album earned the group three
Grammy nominations and two Grammys for best soul gospel performance
by a group and best jazz vocal performance by a duo or group.
   McKnight, Mark Kibble, Mervyn Warren, Cedric Dent, David Thomas
and Alvin ``Vinnie'' Chea have just finished a national tour and
are working on their second album in Nashville.
   The first LP, which was declared gold for selling 500,000
copies, consists of traditional gospel and contemporary Christian
songs such as ``Gold Mine,'' ``Mary'' and ``A Quiet Place.'' But
the sound is a mixture of Manhattan Transfer, the Beach Boys and
Earth, Wind and Fire. McKnight regards the group's sound as a means
of conveying a message as much as music.
   ``In the Christian world there is room for entertainment,'' he
said. ``You have to wrap the message up in a package that is
appealing to people. Most people won't come out and listen to
somebody who is going to thump a Bible over their head. But I will
come out and listen to some nice jazz sounds.
   ``Our message simply is that the love of Jesus Christ will apply
toward everyone.''
   McKnight acknowledges that some listeners might be turned off by
the message, but he points out the album has reached gold status
and is still selling well after its March 1988 release.
   The group tries not only to present its message during
performances but is also noted for adhering to a Seventh-day
Adventist lifestyle off stage. McKnight says none of the members
drinks alcoholic beverages or smokes and several are vegetarians.
   ``Being Seventh-day Adventist first off means we observe the
Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. It has been a
little difficult ... to allow us to have that time. In the record
industry, a lot of times it happens that we have to turn things
down or say can we do it on Sunday morning or Saturday evening.
   ``People are slowly but surely coming around to realize that we
are different.''
   Just as Take 6's lifestyle is different, so will be the next
album, McKnight said. While the group's a cappella sound was
praised by industry figures such as producer Quincy Jones and
Stevie Wonder, whose answering machine played one of the group's
tunes, McKnight said the new album probably won't be entirely a
cappella.
   ``Everybody plays an instrument and we will probably do some
things with instruments. We may do some things with just keyboards
or we may do a full-blown big band arrangement with horns and
everything,'' he said.
   ``Of course there will be gospel music, but we may do some bossa
nova types of things, some funkier types of things and, of course,
jazz. We want to show that we are versatile and can do other types
of music.''
   McKnight says the change might upset some fans.
   ``I think there will be some purists who will say: `Aw, they've
defiled it. They've added instruments.' But at the same time when
you do something and you do it well, then you will gain new fans
and you will preserve the old ones.''
   Like Take 6, McKnight urges other artists, especially aspiring
ones, to put their best work forward. Much of the music produced
these days is poorly crafted fluff that has no lasting value, he
said.
   ``There's a lot of things that just aren't done well. Strive for
excellence,'' McKnight said. ``There is a market out there for
quality. That is why a lot of people have longevity.''

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents Use Computers To Correspond With Pen Pals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALLEY CITY, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Susanne Barstad didn't know a modem
from a disk drive, but she and other residents of Sheyenne Care
Center have learned that computers can be as easy to use as a horse
and buggy.
   ``I figured you're never too old to learn if you want to try,''
the cheery 90-year-old said. ``I've always had a curiosity about
trying new things.''
   Barstad is among 19 residents of the nursing home who use a
computer to write to pen pals around the country through a network
called SeniorNet.
   The nonprofit organization has trained more than 3,500 people on
personal computers at 30 sites in 13 states and Canada since 1986.
Sites include doctors offices, senior centers and colleges, but
Sheyenne Care Center is the only nursing home, said Cindy Schwehr,
the center's SeniorNet coordinator.
   Schwehr believes the program keeps the residents' minds alert
and helps ward off institutional depression. ``I think it boosts
their self-esteem, their confidence. And it's an easy way for them
to establish friendships with people in other parts of the
country.''
   While some of the residents balked at using the computer,
Barstad jumped at the chance. ``I knew computers are going to be
the wave of the future. ... I was happy when they asked me to come
down and try it.''
   Barstad, a retired nurse, corresponds with three other seniors,
including an author in Florida and a former journalist in Virginia.
   Barb Svenningsen, a volunteer who helps the residents operate
the computer, said some still hesitate to use it. ``Their first
question is, `How much is it going to cost?' But those that get on
it and realize they can do it _ they really seem to like it.''
   SeniorNet evolved from a computer class and user manual,
``Computers for Kids over 60,'' by Mary Furlong, an associate
professor of education at the University of San Francisco and now
executive director of SeniorNet.
   Furlong started it because she felt senior citizens had been
left out of the computer revolution of the '80s. ``What I've
learned in the past six years is that older adults have a great
deal of wisdom to share. If we give them access to these tools ...
we as a society stand to learn a great deal.''
   Recognizing a relatively untapped market for computers and
information services, industry has been eager to help SeniorNet get
off the ground.
   Apple Computer Corp. donated $200,000 worth of computers to
equip 11 training sites including Sheyenne Care Center, which
received a keyboard, disk drive, monitor and printer.
   Users are billed only for the time something is sent over
transmission lines, Furlong said. That averages about three or four
hours a month at $12.60 an hour for most users.
   Sheyenne Care Center's bills are paid for by the Markle
Foundation of New York, which has donated $700,000 to SeniorNet.
The center joined after former administrator Jim Tourville heard
about it at a national conference.
   Tourville and former marketing director Tim Hager contacted
Furlong, and in 1987 the nursing home was selected to join eight
other sites in the country.
   ``We had absolutely nothing to lose by doing this _ because
everything was donated _ and hundreds of things to gain,'' Schwehr
said.
   ``This has given them a link with some of their younger family
members because the children are learning about computers in
school,'' she said. ``It gives them something to talk about, and
that can mean so much to an elderly person.''

   The Rev. Marshall D. Moran has talked
with Mahatma Ghandi and drove India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, around in a jeep. But to most of those who know
him, he's simply ``Mickey Mouse.''
   ``I want to continue as long as I find people wanting to talk to
me,'' said the 83-year-old Chicago-born Jesuit, ham license 9N1MM,
the only private radio operator in this tiny Himalayan kingdom
sandwiched between China and India.
   Since he started out on the radio he built himself, Moran
estimates he's talked to more than 80,000 ham operators. ``I used
to talk to captains of ships at sea. They used to respond saying,
`Your signal is not good.'''
   In 1961, the Maritime Radio Club of Houston sent him the radio
he's used since.
   Moran learned to make receivers from a friend in school. ``When
I was 13, I used to sell them to my friends. The parts would cost
me $90 ... I would sell it for $100. In those days $10 was good
money.''
   Those were also the days when broadcasting was young and no one
had heard of television. ``I saw the development of radio and
television from the very beginning. I was lucky to see the
beginning.''
   Moran set sail from the United States in 1929, in search of a
new homeland in Asia. He settled first in India, and became
principal of St. Xavier's School in Patna in the eastern Indian
province of Bihar.
   It was there, in 1939, ``while I was in the middle of putting a
high school in Patna, I met Gandhi _ the great man... After a half
hour talk with him I agreed to work for him,'' Moran recalls.
   ``In 1946, just before the end of the Second World War, I was
going to shillong to give a retreat lecture before Christmas,'' he
said, and Jawaharlal Nehru, who a year later would become prime
minister, was on the train.
   ``Nehru was then president of the Congress (Party). Large crowds
would come to see and hear him when the train stopped at railway
stations, and when his microphone did not work his voice stopped
and I went up to the speakers and connected the wires,'' Moran
said. ``Nehru asked me, `What is the name of your company which
takes so good care of loudspeakers?'
   ``I said, `I am sorry I am a Jesuit priest and an American
missionary.'''
   Moran met Nehru again in 1947 and drove him around Bihar in his
jeep during Hindu-Muslim rioting before the partition of India.
   Two years later, as principal of St. Xavier's in Patna, Moran
made his first trip to Nepal, to conduct examinations for Patna
University. He moved to the mountain kingdom in 1951 so settle,
intent on starting a boarding school.
   At the time, there was no airport, so he took a train to Raxaul,
the last Indian township on the border, and made his way to
Bhimphedi at the base of the Himalayan foothills. ``There were
eight porters waiting for me with an ulinkath (an open palanquin).
Four of them carried me on it and four others followed, running
behind them, changing turns every 10 minutes,'' he said.
   ``This was the only means of transportation system in those days
to enter into the Nepalese capital. ... I saw even cars being
carried by men on their shoulder along the trail. At Bhimphedi,
people took off the wheels of a car and they put the car on top of
two long logs with nine planks strapped sideways and 36 people in
rows of four men carried it on the trail to Thankot.''
   When Moran brought his own car into Nepal that in 1951, however,
he did it by air. Even so, he said, it was a Herculean effort.
   ``The door of the DC-3 was so narrow that I had to take off the
back and front bumpers first. The car was pushed into the plane
with barely an inch to spare to fit it in.'' Some of the plane's
hinges had to be removed, and ``When I asked the pilot for his
permission he said, `I can't give permission to do so but if I go
and take a cup of tea, I might not see it. Hurry up.'''
   That year, Moran met Nehru a third time. The prime minister was
visiting as a state guest, ``saw me at a civic reception standing
among the huge crowd and told King Tribhuvan, pointing at me, `This
is my most favourite driver.'''
   It was also the year that Moran established St. Xavier's, in an
old maharaja's summer palace 5,000 feet up in the Himalayan
foothills, where he still teaches five days a week _ when he
doesn't have his ``ears on.''

<HEAD>Ounce of Flu Prevention IS Worth a Pound of Cure</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

institutes that comprise the National Institutes of Health of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

   The old adage, ``an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure,'' holds true for the flu.
   Each winter millions of Americans suffer the fever, aches and
pains of influenza. Most recover from the effects in a week or so,
but for many older people the flu and its complications are
extremely serious.
   While the body's immune system is busy fighting the flu, a
person is less capable of resisting another life-threatening
infection like pneumonia. Older people and those with chronic
diseases such as heart disese, emphysema, asthma and diabetes have
the greatest risk of developing pneumonia along with the flu.
   And older people are more likely to require hospitalization. Flu
and pneumonia combined are the sixth leading cause of death in the
United States, and 80 to 90 percent of the deaths are in people 65
and older.
   But flu and its complications need not be deadly, and can be
prevented by vaccinating high-risk individuals six to eight weeks
before the season begins.
   Influenza is caused by a virus that infects the nose, throat and
lungs. Flu travels quickly, especially during winter in crowded
indoor places like malls, grocery stores, theaters and hospitals.
When someone with the flu coughs or sneezes, droplets containing
particles of the virus spread to other people.
   After infection, symptoms usually appear in two to four days;
the disease continues to be contagious for another three to four
days.
   Once the virus enters the body, it multiplies and causes a
variety of well-known complaints, including chills and fever,
headache, runny nose, sore throat and a dry cough. Extreme weakness
and muscle aches and pains often last for several days. If the
virus invades the lungs, viral pneumonia can develop.
   To prevent the flu, people 65 and older and residents of nursing
homes and other chronic-care facilities should be vaccinated. Also,
health professionals, nursing home workers and family members who
live with someone over 65 should get a flu shot to avoid spreading
the disease to those at risk.
   Unlike other viruses, the flu virus changes from time to time.
Because different strains of the virus tend to spread flu each
season, a new vaccine is prepared every year. It contains strains
of the flu virus recently circulating worldwide and believed likely
to hit during the coming winter. Nicknames such as the ``Spanish
flu'' and ``Hong Kong flu'' refer to places where large outbreaks
of new flu strains have first appeared.
   The vaccine is made from highly purified, killed viruses.
Because the flu shot does not contain infectious viruses, it does
not cause the flu. The most common side effect is a sore arm, which
occurs in less than one-third of those vaccinated and usually lasts
only a day or so. A few people also may develop a brief, low-grade
fever and some minor aches and pains, which begin six to 12 hours
after vaccination and can persist for one or two days.
   If a person has no special reason not to take aspirin, low doses
(such as one tablet every three to four hours) usually will relieve
these symptoms.
   Immediate allergic reactions, such as hives, rarely occur after
influenza vaccination. Anyone allergic to eggs, which are used to
grow the virus for the vaccine, should NOT receive the vaccine
since some egg protein may be present.
   Since the flu vaccine takes several weeks to work, the best time
to be vaccinated is in November. A vaccine also is available
against the most common types of bacteria which cause pneumonia.
The flu shot can be given at the same time as the pneumonia vaccine
without increasing the side effects. The flu shot must be given
every year, but the pneumonia vaccine should be given only once.
   In addition to the flu shot, an antiviral drug _ amantadine _
can prevent infection by certain strains. The drug is useful for
people who have not had the vaccine or as extra protection for
those who have been immunized.
   When taken soon after the early signs are felt, amantadine
reduces the duration of fever and other symptoms. It also can
prevent infection if taken during the entire four- to six-week
course of a flu epidemic.
   After people stop taking the drug, they become susceptible to
the virus again. It occasionally causes difficulty sleeping,
impaired concentration and dizziness, and has been associated with
falls in older people. As with all medication, patients should take
it only with a doctor's recommendation.

<HEAD>Getting Pleasure out of Intrigue</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

and editor from 1947 until he retired in 1984.

   For 40 years, when Bill Warriner saw a rose he
ticked off its development possibilities. Now he grows them mainly
for pleasure. In fact, Pleasure, his 1990 All-American, is the best
in mass plantings.
   ``One of the main reasons people don't grow roses is they don't
want to take care of them, so if you remove that reason you get
more customers,'' said Warriner, 67, who retired from Jackson &amp;
Perkins Co. ``I do think it's a shame more people, especially
retirees, don't enjoy the pleasure of gardening.''
   There are about 60 rose bushes growing in the 90-by-90-foot
landscape of his home in Tustin, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb where
he's lived the past 20 years. There's also a small vegetable garden
and a couple each of avocado, orange, lemon, lime and persimmon
trees. It's all pretty low-key.
   Of his roses, Warriner says, ``Now I just like to look at them,
smell them, enjoy them. What I'm looking for is beauty in the
landscape.''
   Pink-blooming Pleasure was propagated before his 1987 retirement
as vice president of research at Jackson &amp; Perkins, the
rose-selling giant. So were his 1989 All-Americans _ Tournament of
Roses and Class Act. It can be eight years from propagation to
possible designation by All-America Selection Inc., a non-profit
organization of most U.S. rose producers, so there may be more
Warriner winners. He has 15, more than anyone in the 50-year-old
competition.
   Announcements aren't made for two years after the selection to
give growers time to produce plants for sale. Pleasure will be
available this spring.
   I planted two test plants in March. The desert climate is a
severe test but Pleasure, a floribunda, produced numerous flowers
and good foliage. Compared to others, however, the flowers dropped
their petals quickly after being cut.
   ``Sometimes a rose that holds too long makes a poor landscape
subject because the flowers dry and stay on the bush,'' said
Warriner.
   Warriner, who grew up in Michigan, has never been sure why he's
always had a keen interest in flowers. He went to Michigan State
University because of its horticuture reputation. He also made the
boxing team as a middleweight, ``which probably cut off a lot of
joking about my love of flowers.'' He still can make the weight,
``although the pounds are distributed a lot differently.''
   As a hybridizer, he patented about 110 rose varieties. Jackson &amp;
Perkins estimates 41 million of his roses have been sold. Besides
the 1989 and 1990 All-Americans, they include such standbys as
Simplicity, Cherish, Love, Honor, Intrigue, Impatient, Sun Flare,
Medallion, French Lace and Color Magic.
   Warriner never developed a personal favorite and says it's a
thrill to see any of his growing somewhere ``because it means you
did something right.
   ``I look on each variety in a different way. The variety that
more people have grown than anything else is Simplicity. But it's
certainly not the most beautiful variety I've created. And so it's
hard to say what the favorite is. It would change every year,
depending on my goals in hybridizing at the time.''
   The most difficult part of hybridizing, he feels, is deciding
which roses to use for the crosses. One parent of Pleasure is
Intrigue, but Warriner said he never used it in hybridizing because
``it doesn't really bloom enough to be a good parent, although it's
a very clean plant and fragrant.''
   But when he saw a certain seedling he recalled Intrigue's strong
points and thought the combination had possibilities. He doesn't
recall now what it was that grabbed his attention. ``We rarely had
less than 150,000 seedlings.
   ``You go through them in the spring and summer on almost a daily
basis and pick out those that look like they might have potential,
and discard those with none. The first year we'd select perhaps
1,000 seedling varieties for further propagation. The next year
more would be eliminated. After going through the procedure about
three times, what's left are just a few varieties.''
   How possible is it that the ``perfect rose'' is growing
somewhere, but the owner doesn't realize it and no one else sees it?
   ``I certainly wouldn't go looking for it. Roses have to be
developed. I don't see how the natural process can produce a
winning specimen.''

   The nation's nursing homes need new ways to watch
over ``wanderers,'' the thousands of patients _ especially
Alzheimer's victims _ who are prone to walking around, says a
researcher seeking a high-tech solution.
   In three months of study at an Atlanta nursing home, David
Martino-Saltzman identified two patterns _ ``meandering,'' in which
patients wander aimlessly, and ``circuiting,'' in which they walk
laps around a defined area.
   The challenge for researchers is to find a way for nursing homes
to deal with the problem without physical restraints or drugs, said
Martino-Saltzman, a behavior specialist at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center here.
   His study involved pressure-sensitive floor mats that would
detect electronic tags worn by patients. The computerized system
allowed the patients to wander, but alerted workers when the
patients were where they shouldn't be.
   Such systems can be prohibitively expensive for small nursing
homes, he said. ``Small nursing homes can't afford a $100,000
system. It behooves us to come up with something that's
affordable.''

<HEAD>Opposition to Social Security `Earnings Test' Mounting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Depression-era law that cuts Social Security
benefits for older people who work faces growing opposition from
congressional critics who say it pushes seniors out of the labor
force when the nation needs them.
   Benefit reductions from the so-called ``earnings test'' can
combine with federal, state and local taxes to produce such high
marginal tax rates that many older workers do just as well staying
home, foes say.
   ``It is a tremendous disincentive to work and a tremendous
incentive to just give up and throw in the towel,'' said Sen.
William Armstrong, R-Colo. ``The marginal tax rate on some people
is easily 80 percent and in some cases more.''
   Workers aged 65-69 this year lose $1 in Social Security benefits
for every $2 earned over $8,880, and beneficiaries under 65 face a
similar reduction for earnings in excess of $6,480 _ a 50 percent
effective marginal tax rate by itself. There is no limit for those
70 and older.
   In 1990, the threshold is scheduled to rise to $9,360 for those
65-69 and $6,840 for those under 65, and the penalty will be less
severe for those 65 and above: a $1 reduction in benefits for every
$3 in excess earnings.
   But several proposals in Congress would relax the limits
further, and calls for repeal are gaining new allies.
   Each year almost 1 million Social Security beneficiaries aged
65-69 lose some or all of their benefits because of the earnings
test, and another 100,000 don't file for benefits because of it.
Others stop working, deliberately hold their earnings to just under
the threshold or hide excess wages from the government to avoid the
loss of benefits.
   A 67-year-old woman who works at a county courthouse in Illinois
recently wrote to her congressman that ``because of the earnings
limit, it just doesn't pay to work beyond the $8,880 limit.''
   A. Haeworth Robinson, chief actuary for the Social Security
Administration from 1975-78, once had a maid who quit because he
insisted on paying Social Security taxes on her wages, which would
have alerted the government to her earnings. Robinson believes the
earnings test is justified, but predicted its days are numbered
because of mounting opposition.
   Those seeking to relax the limits include Rep. Tom Tauke,
R-Iowa, who recalled that the woman who took care of his son faced
such a big tax bite on her wages due to the earnings test that she
``would've been better off if we had simply given her big
presents'' at Christmas and other holidays.
   ``It certainly made it clear to us that the system needed to be
changed,'' Tauke said. ``This will be around for a while, but
certainly the trend and the momentum is toward elimination.''
   Critics say the earnings test _ created along with Social
Security in the Depression when older Americans were being
encouraged to retire to free up jobs for young workers _ is an
anachronism at a time when policymakers are trying to keep older
people working longer and labor markets are tight.
   They also argue that it discriminates against working-class
Americans because the benefit reductions are linked only to
earnings, and are unaffected by unearned income such as pensions,
rent and dividends.
   Supporters, meanwhile, maintain it is only fair to limit the
retirement benefits paid to those still pulling in a paycheck.
   Robert Ball, who headed the Social Security Administration from
1962-73, said there is merit to the original concept of paying
Social Security benefits to make up for earnings lost because of
retirement. ``We've already departed from that a long way and I
don't see any reason to go further in the direction of making the
program a straight annuity,'' he said.
   That view is shared by Robinson, who said too many people
believe Social Security benefits are an earned right they bought
and paid for.
   Most workers get back far more in benefits than they paid in
taxes, government figures show. A typical worker who retired at 65
in 1988 had paid about $12,000 in Social Security taxes, which will
be recovered in benefits in two years. The average retiree goes on
to collect benefits for 15 to 20 years.
   ``If you repeal it, you're giving in to this propaganda that
this is a pension, that it bears some relationship to what you paid
in taxes, and that is just not true,'' Robinson said.
   After years of unsuccessful legislative jostling on the earnings
test, Congress appears ready to relax the restrictions over the
next two years. The House this fall passed a proposal to boost the
earnings threshold to $9,720 next year and $10,440 in 1991. The
Senate Finance Committee passed a more generous plan to up the
limits to $11,700 next year and then to $14,520.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King voiced support for
both proposals, saying they would ``encourage seniors to remain in
the workforce and contribute their knowledge and experience to the
nation's economy.''
   There also is growing support in Congress for outright repeal.
About 150 House members are co-sponsoring a bill introduced by Rep.
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., that would eliminate the test for those 65
and above.
   Many Republicans in Congress long have favored repeal of the
earnings test, but the idea now is gaining support among Democrats,
said Carolyn Weaver, a scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute. ``It is far more likely that it'll be repealed or at
least loosened.''
   The Social Security Administration supports the concept of
scrapping the earnings test, but isn't pushing for action because
it says repeal would cost too much _ $25.3 billion over five years.
   ``The idea of eliminating the earnings test is the right way to
go,'' said spokesman Phil Gambino. ``All the belief and the logic
behind it still exists, it's just the costs that are the problem.''
   Some advocates for repeal, however, believe that scrapping the
test would actually save money by returning thousands of retirees
to the workforce.
   Two conservative research groups, the Institute for Policy
Innovation and the National Center for Policy Analysis, this fall
issued a study predicting that at least 700,000 retirees would
enter the labor market if the earnings limit were repealed,
generating $140 million more in new, work-related taxes than the
cost of the additional Social Security benefits that would be paid.

   Our star, recently turned 50, is waking up,
smelling the coffee, and starting to give up that infatuation with
young love. But memories linger...
   Sound like the plot for a TV movie?
   It's actually the plot for television itself, advertising and TV
executives say, as shows like ``The Golden Girls'' draw big
audiences and stars like Bob Newhart, Andy Griffith, Angela
Lansbury and Carroll O'Connor shine.
   ``The audience is getting older,'' said David Poltrack, CBS
senior vice president for planning and research. ``The major
population shift is the aging of the baby boomers. When they were
young television was very youth-oriented.
   ``Gradually, the television networks are recognizing that the
advantage is to go with this aging baby boomer generation.''
   Johnny Carson, at 64, is still the most popular talk show host.
And when CBS' ``Lonesome Dove'' bowled over the competition last
spring with aging Texas plainsmen Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee
Jones, ``Perry Mason'' took the case and saved NBC from disaster.
The Raymond Burr role appeals mainly to older viewers.
   While the population is aging and older people have more
disposable income, advertisers are slow to recognize the changes.
   ``We don't go as far as CBS would like us to go,'' said Betsy
Frank, a vice president of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the world's largest
ad agency. ``CBS has always been more successful when it programs
for a more mature audience. Even ABC is making some concessions
toward older audiences. Its `ABC Mystery Movie' has older stars and
should do well with older viewers on Saturday night. But Fox
Broadcasting has succeeded by targeting a very young audience.''
   Nonetheless, Frank sees a shift to buying demographics of age
25-54.
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, agrees the
audience is aging and has more money, ``but you also have to look
at consumer habits.
   ``Is the person who is 61 years old who's bought Maxwell House
Coffee for 40 years really a good target for your new Vienna Roast?
I recognize that they have more income but I would be careful about
their buying habits.
   ``Our standard approach is to come up with a good show that has
as widespread an appeal as possible. `Golden Girls' is a show that
recognizes the graying of America but it's universal in its appeal.
It attracts teen-agers and young people as well. It defies
advertisers who thought it would be a show that would appeal to
only people over 50.''
   Tartikoff believes older viewers will be more of a factor in the
1990s.
   ``The phenomenon of shows about older people is quite new to
television,'' said Michael Dann, a consultant who formerly headed
programming at CBS and NBC. ``We always had older people in family
shows, but the shows were always about kids and their problems.
What you have now are shows built around the problems that older
people face. The remarkable thing about `The Golden Girls' is that
its audience cuts through all age groups. One show is a hit, two is
a trend. You clearly have that taking place today.''
   The problems older characters face aren't geriatric. They're the
usual mix of romance, sex, appearance, divorce, and the conflicts
of human nature.
   Although favorable demographics is still the preferred method of
advertiser selection, audience size is important and becoming more
so, Dann said. ``Years ago I personally canceled Jackie Gleason
with a 37 share and Red Skelton with a 36 share. You won't find a
television executive doing that today.
   ``Things are so competitive today with new delivery systems and
a fourth network that it's difficult to get a large rating for a
new show. I don't know of anybody today who would cancel a show
with a 30 share.''
   Poltrack said Fred Silverman has become adept at producing hit
shows that appeal to older viewers. ``In the Heat of the Night,''
``Matlock,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,'' and the ``Perry Mason''
movies all have older stars. ``The Father Dowling Mysteries'' was
dropped by NBC but has been picked up by ABC.
   In the new season, CBS' ``Island Son,'' ``Snoops,'' ``Wolf,''
``Major Dad'' and ``Peaceable Kingdom'' are aimed at older viewers.
So are ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' and NBC's ``The Nutt House,''
``Hardball'' and ``Mancuso FBI.''
   Movies and miniseries also lean heavily toward the older
audience.
   ``The networks are sticking with stars and shows that have
worked in the past,'' said Frank. ``It's not that we're seeing the
graying of television. What we're seeing is each network
concentrate more on the things they do best. Because older viewers
do watch more television, you may be seeing more older stars that
appeal to that audience.''
   Poltrack contends that the network trend toward more news and
reality shows is based on more than just the fact that such shows
are less expensive.
   ``When people pass 40 they become more interested in news and
information-based shows. The networks are losing audience to
competitors but the news and information shows are stable. You'll
see more of these shows in the 1990s.''
   A dissenter is Paul Schulman, media buyer for 14 big companies
representing $175 million in network ads. ``I think `The Golden
Girls' was a phenomenon in itself and all the imitations will bite
the dust quickly. When you buy time on shows that appeal to older
people you pay for an enormous waste of circulation. ``Young people
are still the key to high prices on a network. The most expensive
show on TV today is `Cheers' because of its enormous appeal to the
18-49 audience. `The Cosby Show' has a higher rating, but it
attracts a large number of kids. The aim of every network
programmer is to get another `Cheers' or `Roseanne.' At CBS,
`Wiseguy' doesn't get a big rating but that's the show all the
advertisers ask for because of its young demographics.''

   For proof that the tube is booming for older
actors, look no further than this year's Emmy Awards.
   Richard Mulligan, 56, won best actor in a comedy series, and
Carroll O'Connor, 65, won in a drama series. Other nominees
included Colleen Dewhurst, 63; Doris Roberts, 59; Eileen Brennan
and Diahann Carroll, both 54; all four ``Golden Girls''; Angela
Lansbury, 64; and Richard Dysart, 60ish.
   ``I think that's indicative of the effect older actors are
having on television,'' said Peter Golden, GTG Entertainment's vice
president for talent.
   ``We're finding that these days it seems to be hip to be
older,'' Golden said. ``The pilot movie for our series `Baywatch,'
which features mostly young actors, had a lifeguard in his 60s. He
died in the movie but tested so well we're going to add an older
lifeguard to the series.
   ``We're developing a comedy series that focuses on a man in his
70s.''
   Deborah Barylski, an independent talent agent who has cast many
comedy series, is placing more older performers than ever before.
``The scripts I'm getting are paying a lot more attention to that
kind of character.
   ``When I cast `Frank's Place' we used so many elderly people
that I really had to do a lot of digging to find new actors in that
age range.''
   NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' starring Bea Arthur, 63; Betty
White, 67; Estelle Getty, 66; and Rue McClanahan, 53, set the stage
for shows focusing on older characters. Others include CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote'' (Lansbury) and ``Newhart'' (Bob Newhart, 60);
and NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night,'' (O'Connor) and ``Mancuso,
FBI'' (Robert Loggia, 59).

<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aging is characterized by abrupt
declines in mental ability often caused by personal experiences
like forced retirement or a heart attack, according to a long-term
study that suggests some precautions.
   The 33-year Seattle Longitudinal Study has tracked the
intellectual ability of more than 4,000 people ranging in age from
their 20s to their 90s.
   ``What we have to do now is document scientifically what
anecdotally we have seen all along,'' said K. Warner Shaie, head of
Penn State University's Gerontology Center. ``That people don't age
the same way.
   Most aging studies have looked at group averages for different
age groups, rather than tracking changes in individuals over time,
Shaie said. Every seven years, the Seattle study researchers test
five areas: verbal meaning, spatial orientation, inductive
reasoning, and number and word fluency.
   People maintain their mental abilities, on average, into their
60s, Shaie said. ``From then on, on average, you can find some
decline.''
   By 67 more than half the participants showed declines in
reasoning ability, though verbal ability didn't decline for most
until their late 70s.
   ``Inductive reasoning tends to decline sooner, because it
involves speed of response,'' Shaie said. ``Between age 20 and 60,
reaction time approximately doubles, so any skill requiring high
levels of speed is vulnerable.''
   Researchers recently looked at 838 participants who had suffered
a significant drop in one or more of the five abilities over the
previous seven years, and found a link to jarring events in their
lives, such as the death of a spouse and mental decline, Shaie
said. People who are open to change, active and continue to learn
either formally or informally tend to age more slowly.
   ``It's more of a use it or lose it proposition,'' he said.
   Some of the major risk factors are an unstimulating or sedentary
life, low education level with no effort to continue learning and
heart disease, he said.
   As part of his research, Shaie also studied 120 people age 60 or
older who had shown significant declines in mental ability.
   Their abilities in many cases could be improved by five hours of
cognitive training sessions, in which trainers led subjects in a
series of increasingly difficult mental exercises. For example, to
improve spatial orientation, the subjects were told to mentally
rotate increasingly abstract objects.
   ``Can you teach an old dog new tricks? The answer to that is of
course you can teach an old dog new tricks,'' Shaie said. ``It may
take a little longer. As long as you are alive, usually you are
capable of learning.''
   Several of those who failed to improve have been diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease, the mysterious affliction that robs people of
intellectual ability.
   Shaie began his research at the University of Washington.
   ``The argument is, you gain with experience. By that token, the
older you are, the smarter you ought to be,'' he said. ``But, on
the other hand, when we compare young and old people we find that
at some point older people seem not to do as well as younger
people. I got intrigued by this paradox.''

nationwide with sales in the latest 12 months of $5 million to $350
million for the 10th annual list. Besides high return on equity,
companies were graded on ``consistency in earnings growth and
balance-sheet strength,'' Forbes said.
   Return on equity, considered one of the best yardsticks of a
company's performance, shows annual profits as a percent of net
worth. ROE is calculated by dividing stockholders equity into net
income.
   The most profitable company on the list was Franklin Resources,
a mutual fund management concern based in San Francisco and ranked
fifth with a 53.5 percent five-year ROE. Franklin's profit rose 17
percent to $74.25 million in the latest 12 months.
   Franklin also would have given investors the biggest bang for
the buck _ $10,000 invested in the company five years ago would be
worth $132,528 today, Forbes said.
   Among the entire group, insurers had 15 entries, followed by
specialty retailers with 12 and restaurants with 11.
   California led all states with the most companies on the Forbes
list, 23. New York and Chicago were the top cities, each with 10,
followed by Dallas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Philadelphia, with
six each.
   Forbes first published the best small company list in 1979 under
the title ``Up and Comer.'' An investment of $10,000 in each of the
top 100 companies that year would today be worth $4.8 million, a
compound annual rate of 17 percent, the magazine said.
   By Forbes' calculations, the same amount invested in the
Standard &amp; Poors 500 would now be worth $3.2 million.
   Rounding out the top 10 were: Tech-Ops Landauer, Chicago,
(radiation monitoring services), with 54.5 percent ROE; Franklin
Resouces; Quiksilver, Anaheim-Santa Ana, (casual sportswear), 52.7
percent; Colonial Group (Class A), Boston, (fund management), 50.9
percent; One Price Clothing Store, Spartanburg, S.C., (discount
apparel stores), 47.4 percent; International Dairy Queen (Class A),
Minneapolis, (fast-food restaurants), 42.8 percent; and Shorewood
Packaging, New York, (packaging materials), 39.9 percent.
   Forbes said it eliminated from consideration limited
partnerships, estate investment trusts and companies with stocks
that sell for less than $5 or have a small amount of publicly
traded stocks.

<HEAD>Whittle Signs 500 Schools for Channel One</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 schools with nearly 345,000 students
have signed up for the launch of the advertiser-supported Channel
One daily news show for the classroom set to debut this spring, the
project sponsor said.
   Whittle Communications, a Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company,
said Sunday the subscriptions during the first eight weeks of
active recruitment of schools puts the project halfway toward its
goal of having 1,000 schools equipped to receive the show at launch
in March 1990.
   It now expects to have 1,000 schools signed up by the end of
this year.
   The Channel One project has come under fierce attack by national
educational groups, state officials in California and New York and
others who object to giving advertisers a platform for pitching
products to students in the classroom.
   Channel One plans to send a 12-minute news show geared toward
students to participating schools every weekday. Each show will
contain two minutes of paid advertising. In exchange for the
running the show, schools get about $50,000 each in television
monitors, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes.
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications, said
his salesmen have approached about 1,290 school districts
representing 3,855 schools in 24 states so far. He said 10 percent
of the districts have rejected the offer, schools in 238 districts
have signed up and talks continue in the rest.
   He said he expects to have no trouble meeting the longer-term
goal of having 7,000 to 8,000 schools participating in the program
by the end of 1990.
   ``This documents what we thought: that local educators would
view this very differently than national ones,'' he said. ``Some
critics are going to be very surprised.''
   Installation of equipment is expected to begin in January.
   Whittle has previously said it had signed contracts with
advertisers who have bought 56 percent of the available commercial
time on Channel One for the first year of programming.

<HEAD>Average Cost of Bouncing Checks Going Up, Newsletter Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average fee banks charge for
bouncing a check has increased in the past two years, and it varies
widely from city to city, according to a survey by an industry
newsletter.
   Today's edition of Bank Rate Monitor says the average fee for
writing a check on insufficient funds in a checking account was
$16.13 on Oct. 25. That's up from $15.30 in April 1987, when it
last did the survey.
   The highest fees were found in Philadelphia, where some banks
charge as much as $30 for a bounced check, while the lowest were
reported in New York, where some charge customers less than $10,
according to the Palm Beach-based newsletter's survey of 110
institutions in major markets.
   The publication said it found much the same variance in 1987.
   Cynthia McGeever, a vice president of Atlantic Financial Federal
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., gave competition as the reason
Philadelphia-area banks charge more. Atlantic Financial raised its
fee from from $25 to $30 on Oct. 1.
   ``We perceived the whole market was moving upward,'' she told
the newsletter. ``People who had been at $20 were going to $25.
People at $25 were going to $30. I think it was a competitively
driven decision.''
   But she thought $30 would be the upper limit, at least for
awhile.
   ``You may see some people below $30 coming up to $30, but I
don't think you'll see a lot who will go higher than that.''
   The newsletter also reported that the number of banks and
thrifts charging more than $15 per bounced check increased to 44
from 34.
   David Allen, a vice president of First City Texas in Dallas,
which raised its bounced-check fee from $17.50 to $20 last year,
said banks need to consider the fact that bouncing a check is
against the law, not just what it costs to reprocess the check.
   ``If you write checks in excess of the amount in the account,
you are attempting to get an interest-free loan from the bank,'' he
told the publication.
   He suggested customers have an account with overdraft
protection, perhaps covered by a credit card.
   Bank Rate Monitor tracks average interest rates, fees and
charges by major banks, thrifts and credit unions nationwide on a
weekly basis.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Woes Prompt Rail Company To Change Financing For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A skittish junk bond market forced buyers of CNW
Corp. to make significant last-minute changes in the financing of
their $1.6 billion buyout of the railroad company, officials
involved in the plan said.
   The group planned to issue $475 million in high-yield, or junk,
bonds as the final financing of the leveraged buyout to take the
company private. But in a two-week trip to nearly two dozen cities,
officials of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., the
underwriters of the bond offering, discovered buyer resistance.
   The buyout group consists of DLJ, railroad company Union Pacific
Corp., CNW and Blackstone Capital Partners L.P. of New York.
   Chicago-based CNW is the parent of Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that
operates in nine states, most of them in the Midwest.
   Garrett Moran, head of DLJ's high-yield securities operations,
said Friday that potential buyers of the railroad company's
securities indicated they wanted equity as well as better terms for
the junk bonds.
   ``It's a skittish market,'' Moran said.
   The result is that CNW's buyers will make a public equity
offering amounting to 10 percent of the ownership.
   Blackstone, which holds 72 percent of the stock, and DLJ, which
took 22 percent, each will give up a portion of their holdings on a
pro-rata basis for the initial public offering. The remaining 6
percent is held by management, led by Chairman Robert Schmiege.
   In five years, Union Pacific is expected to convert $100 million
in preferred shares into 25 percent ownership.
   The buyers also agreed to raise the yield on the junk bonds by
one quarter of 1 percent to 14.75 percent. CNW spokesman James
Foote said DLJ estimates the added interest will amount to $2
million a year.
   In addition, the buyers have agreed to reset the interest rate
12 months from now to a level that will allow the bonds to trade at
101 percent of face value. That lowers the risk for buyers who are
leery of the value of junk bonds in the current market.
   Trouble in the junk bond market erupted last month when Canadian
retail company Campeau Corp. said it would have trouble making
payments on its high-yield debt. Since then, other junk bond issues
have plunged in price.

<HEAD>Congestion Problems Grow With Record Number of Passengers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines carried a record number of
passengers last year, boosting worldwide profits to $1.6 billion,
the International Air Transport Association said in a report for
release today.
   IATA's annual report, released on the eve of its general
assembly in the Polish capital, predicted another bumper year in
1989, but warned that air congestion would limit future expansion,
especially in Europe.
   In a bid to improve security and safety measures, IATA said it
planned to step up checks on airport security and review the
problem of human error in air crashes.
   Air congestion and security are expected to be the main themes
at IATA's annual meeting.
   The report said IATA's 187 member airlines carried 632 million
passengers last year, a 2 percent rise over the record set in 1987.
Of these, 190 million flew on international scheduled flights, more
than 6 percent more than in 1987.
   A further 22 million people flew on domestic and international
charter flights.
   It predicted international scheduled passenger traffic would
grow 8 percent in 1989 and 1990, although it should drop back to
about 7 percent in the following three years.
   The report said the most rapid expansion should be in Asia and
the Pacific. Air traffic in Europe and North America is expected to
grow at a rate of about 6 percent a year.
   Insufficient airport capacity could limit growth in Europe,
where congestion problems are most acute, it said.
   ``The lack of adequate airport and air space capacity to meet
current and future demand continues to be the major problem facing
the air transport industry today,'' the report commented.
   IATA has identified 35 airports in West Europe as ``congested,''
and has said that Sydney, Bombay, Hong Kong and the Japanese cities
of Tokyo and Osaka also are suffering from lack of airport space.
   The report said that the bomb explosion aboard Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, showed flaws in the implementation of
security measures.
   It said that IATA planned to increase the number and frequency
of airport surveys around the world under its Intensified Aviation
Security Program.
   There were 20 plane crashes in 1988, five more than the previous
year. Human error was the main cause of 16 of the crashes. The
statistics did not list losses caused by terrorism or sabotage.
IATA is to hold a conference within the next two years to overhaul
the industry's approach to the problem of the ``human factor,'' it
said.
   It said recent accidents have led to growing concern about the
structural safety of older aircraft. But excess demand for new
planes was forcing many airlines to modify rather than replace
older aircraft. This would add to costs and impose yet another
constraint on the industry's growth, it added.
   The increase in demand for air travel boosted total profits of
airlines belonging to the Geneva-based association to $1.6 billion
last year, up from $900 million in 1987 and compared with a loss of
$300 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Foreign Business Executives Find Chinese Managers Cautious, Scared</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign business executives who attended an
international forum here found Chinese managers preoccupied with
the government's current ideological campaign and imbued with a
``wait-and-see, cover-your-back attitude.''
   Foreign executives who attended the 9th symposium in China of
the Geneva-based World Economic Forum also said it was clear during
the three-day session last week that Chinese leaders were willing
to let many private and collective business enterprises ``go down
the drain.''
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Chinese also said they were studying devaluation of the yuan and
for the first time in 1990 may roll over some the nation's foreign
debt.
   They said that in meetings with Communist Party General
Secretary Jiang Zemin and other officials the Chinese emphasized
that the nation's economic reforms and open-door policy were
unaffected by the June crackdown on pro-democracy dissent and the
subsequent conservative backlash against Western liberalism.
   They said the Chinese urged the delegates from 65 foreign
companies to see for themselves that China remains eager to do
business with the outside world.
   But they said that during the meetings, which ended Friday,
there was constant reference to upholding the socialist line, and
that ``everyone was quite careful to put themselves in an
ideological framework.'' They said this was quite different from
past meetings, when politics was never mentioned.
   The sources said the more than 100 Chinese managers who attended
the forum were preoccupied with the question of increased Communist
Party interference in the workplace, one aspect of the campaign to
assure the party a leading role in all areas of society.
   ``The relationship of party and manager was clearly foremost in
their minds,'' one of the sources said.
   They said they received conflicting signals on whether increased
party authority would apply to joint Chinese-foreign ventures, and
whether employees of joint ventures would be subject to government
plans to have recent college graduates work at the grass-roots
level for several years.
   The sources said the Chinese were generally more subdued than in
previous years and were cautious in their statements. ``They are
very scared to say anything that might backlash on them,'' one said.
   They said the central role of state companies was repeatedly
emphasized, and that, in contrast to previous years, only one
private entrepreneur participated in the forum.
   China's conservative leaders, in stressing that China must
remain a socialist state, have relegated the nation's thriving
non-government companies to a minor role in the economy. Higher
taxes and the inability to obtain credit have driven many smaller
enterprises out of business.
   The sources said party chief Jiang was convincing in his pledges
that China will remain open, although he was blunt in stating that
the nation's open-door policy will always have a socialist
framework.
   Chinese officials said the government might resort to taking out
new loans to repay loans due next year. They said China, which has
a foreign debt of more than $40 billion, owes somewhere between $4
and $9 billion next year.
   Officials also said the current austerity program designed to
curb economic growth and slow inflation could last two to five
years more. The squeeze on credit and cutback on building projects
has affected many joint ventures, and the business executives were
told foreign investors will have to bring their own money.

   London share prices rose sharply in extremely
light trading Monday, as the market benefited from a technical
rebound after its sharp fall on Friday, and responded to sterling's
healthy early tone.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 28.2 points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,110.3
points, up from a morning low of 2,101.2 points.
   Despite the upturn, dealers said the market remained highly
nervous about a potential further weakening in sterling, which
might force Britain's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major,
to hike interest rates.
   Volume came to an extremely light 129.9 million shares, compared
with 310.9 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>Auto Industry Turns Downward; Dealers Urged to Exercise Clout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As automakers fight to hold their shares of a
shrinking automobile market, the nation's dealers _ the companies'
first customers _ are being urged to toughen their act.
   U.S. auto dealers have been watching their profits slide.
Industry estimates indicate that one of every two dealers are
either losing money or just breaking even.
   And now, the president of the nation's largest dealer
organization is urging the businesses to make drastic cost-cutting
moves.
   It appears to be another step in a growing militancy among the
20,000 members of the National Automobile Dealers Association since
Ron Tonkin took over earlier this year as the organization's
president.
   Weeks ago, as automakers prepared for the Oct. 1 beginning of
the 1990 model year, dealers said they would cut their orders,
perhaps by as much as 30 percent of last year's.
   Tonkin, through an advertisement in automotive trade magazines,
is turning up the heat.
   He is urging dealers to take cost-cutting action, especially in
``flooring.'' Flooring is the money paid, mostly in interest, to
hold unsold automobiles on dealership lots. It is one of the
biggest expenses for dealers, Tonkin said.
   Cutting inventory will cut stock-carrying costs, he said.
   Before the advertisement appeared, dealers had begun cutting
their orders. On Thursday, when the companies reported sharply
lower third-quarter earnings, officials with each of the Big Three
automakers confirmed that recent dealer orders were lower than a
year ago. They declined to say by how much.
   Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly industry newsletter, said
domestic automakers' dealers had a 59-day supply of cars on hand at
the end of September.
   The Fast Track News, a sales-oriented newsletter published every
10 days by Integrated Automotive Resources Inc. of Wayne, Pa., said
dealers had a 66-day car supply on hand as of Oct. 20.
   Tonkin suggested that a dealer who had considered a normal
supply to be about 60 days slash that to 15 to 30 days.
   ``Let's face it,'' he said. ``If every dealer in this country
decided that they had 50 percent too much inventory, if it all
happened at once, it's going to impact production.''
   While helping dealers cut their costs and improve their profits,
such a move could further hurt manufacturers who already have taken
these hits:
   _The companies have said that incentive programs, which gnawed
away at profits during the first three quarters of this year,
probably will continue into the fourth quarter and 1990, but at
lower levels.
   _Vehicle sales this year are predicted to be somewhere between
14.5 million and 15 million cars and light trucks. That would be
down significantly from the 15.6 million sold in 1988.
   _The sales downturn likely will result in more production cuts,
analysts have said, mostly coming in short-term downtime for
``inventory adjustment.''
   _Third-quarter profits for the nation's Big Three automakers,
reported last week, were 27.3 percent below last year's earnings.
And executives with each company have said the pressure on profits
won't let up for at least a year.
   ``The outgrowth of this,'' Tonkin said, ``has been a flexing of
strength, a feeling on the part of dealers that they no longer have
to fear stating their real feelings directly to the automakers and
their (sales) representatives.
   ``Maybe it's time that they joined us,'' he said of the
automakers. ``We have been in the red for some time.''

   General Motors Corp. is planning to build a new
engine plant in Europe, which might encompass plans for a joint
components venture with Jaguar PLC, sources said Monday.
   Alternatively, a separate engine plant might be built as part of
General Motors planned tie-up with the British luxury car maker,
the sources said.
   GM has 31 manufacturing centers in Europe.
   Jaguar, which has spurned advances from Ford Motor Co. because
it wants to remain independent, has been negotiating a cooperation
agreement with GM for several weeks.
   A GM spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping
with British practice, said the U.S. auto maker was committed to
guaranteeing Jaguar's independence, and described recent talks as
``well-advanced.''
   A ``complex and detailed'' announcement of a joint agreement
between General Motors and Jaguar is to be made by Jaguar ``some
time in the next two and a half weeks,'' a source said.
   The deal is expected to include plans for a jointly developed
new auto model between General Motors and Jaguar, and a number of
agreements for joint component production, sources close to the
talks said.
   General Motors, which eventually is expected to take a minority
stake of up to 30 percent in Jaguar, would inject cash into the
British company and make available its technology. In return,
General Motors hopes to benefit from the Jaguar name, and thwart
Ford from either linking up with, or taking over, Jaguar.
   Sources close to General Motors said it hasn't decided yet
whether the new European engine plant would be built either in
Britain, West Germany or Austria.
   ``A key factor deciding if the plant will be built in Britain is
whether the group can reach an agreement with unions at Vauxhall
that they will speak with one voice,'' a source said.
   Four unions represent workers at Vauxhall, a General Motors unit.
   Though the company isn't necessarily calling for a single union
deal, it is ``looking for a new approach,'' a source said.
   General Motors announced Friday that it had received early U.S.
regulatory clearance to begin buying up to 15 percent of Jaguar.
   Ford, which previously obtained the same clearance, has raised
its stake in the British company to 13.2 percent. It has said it is
prepared to launch a full bid after takeover restrictions are
dropped.
   Both companies are prevented from raising their share in Jaguar
to over 15 percent by a ``golden share'' the British government
holds in Jaguar until the end of 1990.

<HEAD>Investor Group Offers $68 Million for Detroit Free Press</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 1 graf for 5th pvs to UPDATE with Knight-Ridder declining
comment on Michigan Investor Group offer; picks up 6th graf pvs, `Oral

<TEXT>
   An investor group has offered to buy the
Detroit Free Press for $68 million as lawyers prepared for oral
arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court in a case involving a joint
operating agreement with The Detroit News.
   William D. McMaster, head of the Michigan Investor Group, made
the bid to buy the Free Press in a letter Sunday to James K.
Batten, president of Knight-Ridder Inc. which owns the newspaper.
   ``The Michigan Investor Group, if successful in purchasing the
Free Press, will continue the 158-year-old Detroit Free Press as an
ongoing enterprise and will convert the editorial format to a
`statewide community newspaper,' '' McMaster said in a news release.
   The owners of the two newspapers, Gannett Co. Inc. and
Knight-Ridder, have said the JOA would force the layoffs and a
price increase. Knight-Ridder has said it will sell the Free Press
or close it if the JOA is denied.
   Officials at Knight-Ridder's Miami headquarters were reviewing
McMaster's letter this morning and could not immediately comment on
it, corporation spokeswoman Heidi Etzold said.
   Oral arguments were scheduled for today in the JOA case.
   ``It's the time when all the elements of the case will converge,
all the people involved will be together for the last time,'' said
William Schultz, an attorney for JOA opponents.
   The Supreme Court justices may vote on the JOA this week, but
their decision isn't likely to be made public until next summer.
   Eight of the nine justices will vote. Justice Byron R. White
withdrew from the case citing personal reasons. A 4-4 tie would
uphold the JOA.
   The court may uphold two lower-court approvals of the JOA,
reject the merger or instruct Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
to reconsider the decision.
   Schultz represents Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a
group of readers, advertisers, weekly newspaper Publisher W. Edward
Wendover, former News columnist Matt Beer and state Sen. John
Kelly, D-Detroit.
   The Detroit Free Press, which declared itself a failing
newspaper in May 1986, filed under the Newspaper Preservation Act
of 1970 for permission to merge with The Detroit News. A JOA allows
newspapers to combine business operations but maintain editorial
independence.
   McMaster said he hoped to complete the purchase of the Free
Press by the end of the year, provided the newspaper supplied the
group with statements on its operations and assets.
   Opponents say the merger is prompted by greed and would hurt
smaller area newspapers. Some question the independence of the two
papers under a JOA.
   ``If this JOA is upheld, we will see the end of competitive
journalism in this country by the end of the century,'' said Louis
Mleczko, a News reporter and president of Local 22 of The Newspaper
Guild.

<HEAD>EPA Official Warns Petroleum Producers of Oil Field Waste Hazards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum producers aren't doing enough to
protect the environment from potentially hazardous oil field wastes
and in some cases aren't using common sense, an Environmental
Protection Agency official said.
   ``The oil and natural gas industry is way behind in waste
management both in the volume and the toxicity of wastes
generated,'' Robert Tonetti, acting deputy director for the EPA's
waste management division, said Sunday.
   Tonetti also said the industry needs more regulation at all
government levels, especially in the area of commercialized waste
management facilities.
   He spoke to the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
The conference in San Antonio lasts through Tuesday.
   Oil producers, in some cases, are not using ``common sense''
when disposing of exploration and production wastes, allowing
non-hazardous materials to be mixed with toxic chemicals, Tonetti
said.
   If not disposed of properly, oil field wastes threaten public
health and safety because wastes generated during oil exploration
and production can wipe out groundwater supplies and contaminate
soil, Tonetti said.
   Under the EPA's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, those
wastes are exempt from hazardous waste regulations.
   But the act applies the exemption only to drilling fluids,
produced waters and other wastes associated with crude oil or
natural gas production.
   The exemption does not include unused chemicals, spent solvents,
empty drums, used lubrication oils or acidic cleaners. These
chemicals sometimes get mixed with non-hazardous wastes and create
a hazardous substance and a health risk, Tonetti said.
   ``A lot of misunderstanding exists among producers about what is
exempt and what is not,'' he said.

   The stock market gained ground today, bouncing
back from last week's drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 92.42 points last
week, climbed 14.35 to 2,611.07 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in

640 up, 549 down and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.37 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the upswing was attributable to ``bargain
hunting'' by traders attracted to stocks that have been hit by
selling this month.
   They also noted hopes for evidence in the next few days that the
economy was maintaining a moderate pace of growth, despite a recent
barrage of disappointing corporate earnings reports.
   The government is due to report Tuesday on the index of leading

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Open Lower On Harvest; Wheat Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade while wheat
futures were narrowly mixed.
   The slight drop in corn and soybean values partly reflected
ideas that mild, dry weather allowed harvesting of those crops to
continue at a rapid pace over the weekend.
   Rain forecast for later this week in the Corn Belt could hamper
harvest activity. But with most of the crop already in, traders are
focusing more on foreign demand and on the South American soybean
crop, which is now being planted, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``They're behind normal and they need rain,'' he said of soybean
producers in Brazil and Argentina.
   The soybean market also was pressured by expectations that a
large number of deliveries will be posted against the November
soybean contract on Tuesday, the first day for traders to declare
their intentions to deliver soybeans against the contract.
   Wheat futures were supported by expectations that the Soviet
Union will soon make a major purchase of U.S. wheat, Lespinasse
said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1} cents lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $3.99{ a
bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.41\ a bushel; oat futures were { cent lower to { cent higher
with December at $1.43\ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2{ cents

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with December
at 74.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .23 cent
higher with November at 82.45 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .27 cent lower with December at 45.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .45 cent higher with February
at 52.20 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Friday.

<HEAD>Again, The Issue Is Investor Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rascality and privilege are bad seed in the
stock market, surviving repeated scandals and reforms and sprouting
spontaneously again and again under the allure of easy or quick
profits.
   Some important players think they see signs of the weed again.
   As in the past, there are many who see nothing wrong _ in this
instance, with so-called program trading. Some of the most esteemed
names in the industry defend the practice. The New York Stock
Exchange accommodates program traders.
   But there are others _ brokers, big investors, mutual funds,
listed companies among them _ who are determined to uproot the
practice, saying it caters to privilege and in doing so destroys
public confidence.
   These are individuals and institutions with real clout, and they
aren't likely to back off. They are angry and determined.
   Program trading takes various forms, but the most controversial
is stock-index arbitrage trading, or short-term, computer-triggered
buying or selling to exploit brief inconsistencies between prices
in spot and futures markets.
   Because it is based on market mechanics rather than underlying
stock values, the strategy is called mindless. Mindless or not,
some brokers play the game for their own accounts, regardless of
the impact on their own customers. And, because the formula is
shared, that impact can be explosive in either direction.
   One of the latest to vent outrage is the investment management
firm of Neuberger &amp; Berman, which took full-page newspaper
advertisements to demand an end to ``the numbers racket.''
   Program trading, it said, serves no economic purpose ``except to
line the pockets of a handful of institutions and individuals.''
   In addition, it said, it causes mindless volatility, drives
individual investors from the market, reduces stock values, and
``mocks the fundamental truth that the price of a stock should be
based on its value.''
   It is a type of insider trading, the company says, in which big
players, hooked up directly to the New York Stock Exchange
computers, buy and sell on 5 percent margin while other investors
stand in line and must put up 50 percent.
   ``In short, program trading is nothing more than a numbers
racket in which those running the numbers win, while individual
investors, corporations, and the American economy lose.''
   For those who follow stock market history, this is an old theme,
an echo of similar instances in which it was alleged and sometimes
shown that stock trading held special advantages for the powerful,
making it in effect a club.
   The club is forever being broken up, most memorably following
the crash of 1929 but again in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when
some of the old-line brokers collapsed under an avalanche of paper
and had to be dissolved.
   The shenanigans of the 1920s, culminating in the big collapse,
had scared individuals from the market. In the 1960s, the New York
Stock Exchange sought to regain them, urging investors to ``own
your share of American business.''
   Millions of small investors were lured into a market unprepared
for them. Accounts were mishandled, client money was misused. Some
brokers made easy profits, others lost on every sale. Individuals
and institutions fell together.
   After that, government and the industry sought to reassure
investors. A form of insurance was introduced, and to some extent
it succeeded. Individuals remained a force _ but a shrinking one in
relation to mutual and pension funds.
   In recent years, however, there is evidence of a further retreat
from the market, in part because of market-manipulation scandals.
Over the five years 1984-1988, individual investors cashed in a
half-trillion dollars of shares. Last year the decline amounted to
$105 billion. The selling continues in 1989.
   Once again, therefore, the issue is public confidence in the
market, a market so volatile that even some of the biggest players
are concerned.
   A sound market, they say, is a non-volatile one in which buying
and selling is matched in an orderly fashion. A volatile market,
they say, is prima facie evidence of one that is failing its
customers.

<HEAD>Striking Deere Workers Ratify New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HORICON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production workers at John Deere &amp; Co.'s
plant in Horicon ratified a 3-year contract Monday, ending a nearly
month-long strike.
   Members of Local 873 of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted 666-205 in favor of the
proposed 3-year contract, the company announced. The local has
about 940 employees.
   ``We just received word that the contract passed by a 78 percent
to 22 percent margin,'' said Deere spokesman Bob Combs. ``That
obviously brings the strike to a conclusion.''
   Combs and union officials declined to release details of the new
contract, which will expire Oct. 1, 1991.
   ``It was a very comprehensive proposal,'' Combs said. ``Like any
contract, (it) was a compromise.''
   A tentative agreement was reached Friday after union
representatives and company officials met for the entire day.
   Some employees will report back to work Tuesday and the rest
will be back to work by Wednesday, union spokesman Steve Kovalaske
said.
   Machinists ratified the contract Monday during a three-hour
meeting at Horicon High School, Kovalaske said.
   The workers went on strike Oct. 1, one day after voting to
reject the company's last offer. The plant, which produces lawn and
garden equipment, has been idle since the strike began.
   The only other strike at the Horicon plant was in December 1958
when union members walked out for a week.
   The Machinists union is still on strike against Eastern
Airlines, where it was joined by pilots and flight attendants
starting March 4. The union also is continuing a walkout against
aircraft maker Boeing Co. which began early this month.

   Share prices closed sharply higher in the year's
thinnest volume Monday on the London Stock Exchange, supported
largely by a technical bounce after last week's steep declines.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 30.1
points, or 1.4 percent, higher at 2,112.2.
   The key index finished below a session high of 2,117.1 posted
after Wall Street opened stronger. But it had showed strength
throughout the London session, hitting a low of only 2,102.2 within
the first few minutes of trading.
   Volume was only 256.6 million shares, breaking the previous 1989

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for striking Machinists and Boeing
Co. resumed face-to-face negotiations today in an attempt to end
the union's 27-day walkout.
   Federal mediator Doug Hammond brought both sides together after
talking separately Sunday with negotiators for the company and the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   Hammond said he wants to keep both sides talking until an
agreement is reached, ``but we'll see once they get here.''
   Neither side, however, has changed its stance, with the union
saying it wants more money out of the prosperous aerospace company
and Boeing saying it's offered all it will.
   Hammond said he could not talk about issues in the strike. He
said Sunday's talks simply involved negotiators redefining their
positions to him and setting up terms of today's discussions.
   The negotiations are the first since an effort by Hammond to
restart the talks failed Oct. 18.
   Hammond said there was no specific item that got the two sides
talking again, other than his decision it was time for negotiations
to resume.
   ``Doug Hammond is a professional. He knows how to read the
climate and when it's time to get the two sides together,'' said
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder.
   Some 57,800 members of the Machinists union are on strike
against Boeing nationwide in the walkout that began Oct. 4.
   ``It is appropriate for Boeing and the union to resume
negotiations at this point to hear each other's position across the
bargaining table,'' chief Boeing negotiator Larry McKean said late
Sunday in a statement. ``Beyond that, I cannot speculate on the
direction, timing or ultimate outcome of the negotiations.''
   ``This round of bargaining will hopefully lead to a settlement,
but you have to be at the table to discuss the issues before you
agree on them,'' Tom Baker, president of IAM District Lodge 751,
said Sunday night.
   Of the money issue, Baker said succinctly, ``They got it, we
want it.''
   Boeing said today that its net earnings for the quarter ending
Sept. 30 were $242 million, or $1.05 a share, on revenue of $6.36
billion, compared with profits of $144 million, or 63 cents a
share, on revenue of $3.72 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Boeing had net earnings of
$598 million, or $2.60 a share, on revenue of $15.43 billion,
compared with earnings of $440 million, or $1.92 a share, on
revenue of $12.09 billion.
   The third-quarter figures don't show effects from the strike,
but Boeing warned today that the walkout would seriously hurt sales
and earnings the rest of the year.
   The strike began after machinists overwhelmingly rejected
Boeing's three-year contract offer that included annual pay raises
of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent and bonuses of 8 percent in
the first year and 3 percent in the second. The offer also had
cost-of-living increases to virtually cover inflation, a reduction
in mandatory overtime from 200 to 160 hours per quarter and higher
benefits.
   Machinists represent 43,300 Boeing workers in the Seattle area,
12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred
others in California, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other
states.
   Boeing, which employs 164,000 workers worldwide and about
106,000 in the Seattle area, has kept its plants open and delivered
15 commercial jets since the strike began.
   Machinists last week collected the first of their $100-a-week
strike payments. Health insurance for strikers expires this
Wednesday, though employees can extend the coverage by paying
premiums themselves.
   Last Friday, Boeing announced plans to reorganize its military
and aerospace business to reduce losses and cut overhead. The
changes primarily involve redrawing managment assignments with
little change in job assignments or employment level at any plants.
Boeing spokesmen said the decision was unrelated to the strike.
   The jets Boeing has delivered during the strike were all
virtually completed before the walkout began. So far this year,
Boeing has received orders for 807 commercial jets valued at $43
billion.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 92.42 points last

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
slightly lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the corn and
soybean markets succumbed to harvest pressure and pulled wheat
prices down as well.
   The selling mainly reflected a perception that mild, dry weather
allowed harvesting of corn and soybeans to continue at a rapid pace
over the weekend, analysts said.
   Rain forecast for later this week could hamper harvest activity
in the eastern Corn Belt and the Southeast. But most of the
Midwestern crops have already been gathered and traders are
increasingly turning their attention to export demand, which
remained slack on Monday.
   The soybean market also was pressured lower by expectations that
a large number of delivery notices will be posted against the
November soybean contract on Tuesday, the first day for traders to
declare their intentions to deliver soybeans against the contract.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were { cent to 2 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in December at $3.96{ a

<HEAD>Two More Firms Halt Index Arbitrage</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Program Trading Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more Wall Street brokerages said Monday they
would limit their program trading, joining other major firms that
have backed away from the strategy under pressure following the
recent stock market volatility.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said that effective immediately it would not
execute index arbitrage for its clients. Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. said
it had ceased index arbitrage for its own accounts but would
continue using the strategy for its customers.
   The announcements followed similar moves by large brokerages
last week. On Friday, Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Bear, Stearns &amp;
Co., two of the biggest users of program trading, said they would
stop using index arbitrage to trade for their own accounts;
PaineWebber Group Inc. stopped using all forms of the strategy.
   Index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy aimed at
profiting on brief and minute differences between prices of stocks
and stock-index futures, which are traded on Chicago futures
exchanges.
   The trading tactic, in which millions of shares can be bought or
sold in seconds, often is geared to make short-term profits during
excitable markets. Critics say it can accentuate market movements,
leading to sharp price swings such as the 190-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average on Oct. 13.
   Merrill Lynch halted index arbitrage for its own account nearly
two years ago following the Black Monday stock market crash, which
critics said was worsened by program trading.
   In Monday's statement, Merrill Chairman William A. Schreyer and
President Daniel P. Tully said ``the causes of excess market
volatility are far more complex than any particular computer
trading strategy.''
   But they conceded that ``index arbitrage has been clearly
identified in the investing public's mind as a contributing factor
to excess market volatilty.''
   Merrill would stop executing such trades until the firm is
``satisfied that effective controls are in place,'' the statement
read.
   Kidder was the third most active index arbitrage firm during
September, trading 34.6 million shares with the strategy during the
month, while Merrill Lynch ranked seventh with 12.8 million shares,
according to the New York Stock Exchange. Morgan Stanley led all
firms with volume of 53.1 million shares.
   The brokerage houses have come under considerable pressure to
eliminate the strategy. Last week, Kemper Financial Services Inc.
and Keystone Group Inc., two major institutional investors, said
they would no longer buy or sell stock through brokerages that
conduct index arbitrage. Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
Hartford, Conn., followed suit Friday.
   On Monday, the investment management firm Neuberger &amp; Berman
took out a full-page New York Times advertisement imploring: ``Stop
the numbers racket on Wall Street.'' The ad urged investors to
voice their concerns in writing to Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Richard Breeden and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan.
   According to New York Stock Exchange figures, program trading of
all kinds accounted for a record 13.8 percent of average daily
volume in September, the most since the exchange began keeping such
figures in July 1988.

   The stock market pulled out of last week's
slide, but couldn't mount much of a rally in a quiet session Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 92.42 last week,
recovered 6.76 to 2,603.48.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
684 up, 774 down and 482 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 126.63 million
shares, down from 170.33 million Friday and the lightest total in

   Analysts said the market got some benefit from ``bargain

   They also noted hopes for evidence in the next few days that the

   The government is due to report Tuesday on the index of leading
economic indicators for September. Advance estimates call for the
index, which is designed to function as a kind of economic crystal
ball, to show a modest increase.
   However, concern has spread on Wall Street lately that corporate
earnings will be disappointing for some time to come, even if the
economy isn't headed for a full-fledged recession.
   The profileration of unpleasant surprises in third-quarter
earnings reports issued to date ``is in stark contrast to the
experience of 1987, 1988 and early 1989,'' noted Abby Joseph Cohen,
an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``During that period, persistently rising profit expectations
provided support to rising stock prices.''

   The dollar was mixed against the major foreign
currencies Monday while the British pound advanced for the first
time since last week's political upheaval in London.
   Gold prices slipped in domestic trading after rising overseas.
   There was no news to affect currency dealings, and analysts said
investors spent the day squaring their positions following the
pound's sharp decline late last week.
   Sterling chalked up its first gains since Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson resigned last Thursday night and caught many
traders by surprise.
   Robert Ryan, an analyst with the Bank of New York, said
sterling's rise reflected short-covering, the buying of dollars to
fulfill previous agreements to sell them.
   The pound rose to $1.5825 in New York, up from late Friday's
$1.5795, after closing earlier in London at $1.5785, up from
$1.5750 Friday.
   Some dealers warned, however, that sentiment toward sterling
remained bearish.
   ``You're bucking the trend if you try to take the pound higher
right now,'' said a corporate dealer at a U.S. bank in London.
``I'm not convinced the pound's fall has stopped.''
   Overseas dealers said trading was lackluster as dealers waited
for fresh economic news later in the week.
   Traders said they did not expect the dollar to move far away
from its current levels this week unless Tuesday's release of the
September Index of Leading Economic Indicators or Friday's
unemployment report provided some surprises.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8340 West German marks, up from 1.8295; 1.6050
Swiss Francs, up from 1.6005; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.2150;
1,346.00 Italian lire, down from 1,348.00; and 1.1735 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1747.
   The dollar rose to 141.90 Japanese yen in New York from late
Friday's 141.75. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 142.17 yen from
142.75 Friday, and in London, the dollar declined to 142.05 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8360 West German marks, up from 1.8300; 1.6065
Swiss francs, up from 1.6005; 6.2325 French francs, up from 6.2190;
2.0727 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820; 1,348.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,342.00; and 1.1747 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1746.
   Gold edged lower in New York following gains in foreign trading.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $376.65
for a troy ounce of gold, down from late Friday's $377.25. Earlier,
a troy ounce of gold fell 70 cents to close at $377.80 on the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $376.75 a troy ounce,
up from $374.25 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose to a closing bid of
$376.75, up from $373 bid late Friday, and in earlier Hong Kong
trading, gold rose $1.45 to close at a bid $378.75.
   Silver prices also were mixed.
   A troy ounce of silver fell 3.8 cents to $5.243 on the Commodity

price of $5.22 a troy ounce from $5.19 bid late Friday.

<HEAD>Miller Introducing Its First Non-Alcoholic Brew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller Brewing Co. on Monday introduced its
first non-alcoholic brew, a product it said was spurred by growing
anti-drinking sentiment in the United States.
   Miller also announced plans for a 12-week Super Bowl advertising
campaign featuring two celebrity-coached teams battling on a
football field over rival ``taste great'' and ``less filling''
claims for Miller Lite beer.
   Miller's Sharp's brand non-alcohol brew will be introduced for
sale nationwide Jan. 1 and will be backed by a national marketing
effort but no test-marketing, Miller officials said.
   Non-alcoholic beers have been popular in Europe for some time,
and other U.S. brewers, including Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., Pabst
and G. Heileman, already sell non-alcohol or low-alcohol brands.
   Miller touts Sharp's as having a taste like real beer due to a
new brewing process the company developed.
   Miller experimented in 1984 with a low-alcohol beer, also called
Sharp's, but the brew did not advance beyond test marketing.
   Annual U.S. production of non-alcoholic beers is about a million
barrels a year, compared with the national beer market of more than
182 million barrels. But the non-alcoholic segment is growing at
the rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year while the overall beer
market has been stable, analysts said.
   David Krishock, new products category director for Miller, said
growth in the non-alcoholic beer market prompted Miller to bring
Sharp's out nationwide without test marketing.
   The new brew will have 74 calories per 12-ounce serving _ about
half the calories of regular beer _ and will be sold in bottles,
cans and kegs.
   Jerry Steinman, publisher of the industry newsletter Beer
Marketer's Insights, said Miller's introduction of a non-alcohol
beer was not surprising in view of an anti-alcohol atmosphere he
said prevailed in the United States.
   Steinman said non-alcoholic beers had not proven widely popular
in the United States largely because they lacked the taste of
regular beer, and because brewers had found it difficult to brew a
non-alcohol beer with real beer taste.
   Krishock said most brewers produced a non-alcoholic product by
using a normal brewing cycle and then removing the alcohol along
with the ``real beer'' taste.
   Under Miller's new brewing process, when the yeast is added to
the wort _ the end product of the barley-cooking process _ the
temperature is kept low so that fermentation is slow and produces
minimal alcohol, at the same time that the yeast contributes its
taste to the brew.
   Miller said its Super Bowl ad campaign, which will begin Nov. 5,
will feature 12 weeks of television, radio and print advertising
and a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trips to Super
Bowl XXIV in New Orleans.
   The celebrity teams will be coached by pro football Hall of
Famer Larry Csonka and actor George Wendt, of television's
``Cheers,'' while actor Richard Moll of television's ``Night
Court'' will referee.
   Last year, Anheuser-Busch ran a Super Bowl ad campaign featuring
battling teams of animated helmet-clad beer bottles pitting its
Budweiser and Bud Light brands against each other.

   Oil futures prices drifted lower in moderate
trading Monday led by weakness in the wholesale gasoline market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
unleaded regular gasoline fell 1.21 cents to 53.41 cents a gallon.
   The contract gained nearly a penny on Friday amid reports about
possible problems at a Chevron Corp. refinery in El Segundo, Calif.
Chevron confirmed late in the day that a catalytic cracking unit
with an output of 60,000 barrels a day of gasoline had been closed
for repairs. The company said, however, that the closure would not
seriously affect output.
   ``(Gasoline) gained Friday on news about the Chevron refinery.
It shouldn't have gained and today it came back off,'' said Bob
Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Weakness in the gasoline market dragged other oil prices lower,
traders said.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, closed at $19.72 a barrel, down 5 cents.
January WTI fell 10 cents to $19.47 a barrel.
   No. 2 heating oil for November delivery settled 0.04 cent lower
at 57.64 cents a gallon, while December heating oil rose 0.07 cent
to end at 58.03 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said crude prices, which have weakened in recent days,
could drift lower in advance of the Nov. 25 meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, Austria.
Traders have attributed the decline to concern about higher OPEC
production in the face of slackening U.S. demand.
   Various estimates have put the cartel's total output at around
23 million barrels a day, well in excess of its official quota of
20.5 million barrels a day. And while various OPEC members have
suggested that increasing worldwide demand supports the higher
output, some analysts argue that world oil prices could weaken if
the United States, the largest consumer of oil, cannot absorb some
of the excess.

   Copper futures prices fell sharply Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, extending the market's two-week-old slide amid
new selling prompted by a continued easing of supply fears.
   On other futures markets Monday, precious metals retreated; pork
bellies surged while livestock futures were mixed; oil futures
fell; grains and soybeans slipped; and stock-index futures were
narrowly mixed.
   Copper settled .30 cent to 3.35 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $1.128 a pound, its lowest price since
Aug. 10.
   Copper traders began selling at the opening bell in reaction to
the London Metal Exchange's report of a smaller-than-expected 550
metric ton decline in warehouse stocks of copper last week. The
market had expected a drawdown of as much as 4,000 tons.
   The report reinforced perceptions that pressure on copper
supplies is easing following the recent settlement of a two-month
Canadian mine strike and the expected reopening of Mexico's largest
copper mine after a two-month shutdown.
   ``Two-thirds of the near-term production problems seem to have
been resolved,'' said metals economist Fred Demler of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., referring to the Canadian and Mexican mines.
A third major copper mine, in Papua New Guinea, has been shut down
since mid-July due to terrorism in the area.
   The market appeared to ignore news of a potential new supply
threat in Chile, where workers at two mines, two mills and a
smelter operated by an Exxon Corp. affiliate took a strike vote
Friday that could result in a strike as early as next Thursday,
when their contract expires.
   The Chilean operation, known as Exxon Disputada, produces about
115,000 metric tons of copper annually, less than any of the
aforementioned three mines, said Tom Torget, a spokesman for Exxon
Coal and Minerals Co. in Houston.
   Under Chilean law, a strike would be required next Monday if no
agreement is reached by then, Torget said. But, he said, ``we think
both sides are interested in an agreement.''
   Gold and silver futures fell modestly on the Comex, but
sustained most of the gains made last Thursday and Friday, when
gold rose more than $9 an ounce.
   Demler said the gold market's refusal to sell off sharply could
be construed as a bullish signal.
   But analyst Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. predicted
gold would ``encounter some formidable resistance'' at about $383 a
troy ounce in the December contract.
   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.20 lower with December at $380.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 3.8 cents lower with December
at $5.283 a troy ounce.
   Frozen pork-belly futures rallied strongly on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on reports that Yugoslavia had bought 200
metric tons of U.S. bellies for November delivery and was
considering buying up to 800 tons more. A pork belly is the part of
a hog from which bacon is made.
   Pork bellies settled 1.25 cents to 1.75 cents higher with
February at 53.60 cents a pound; live cattle finished .25 cent
lower to .13 cent higher with December at 74.15 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .15 cent higher with November
at 82.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .42 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with December at 45.75 cents a pound.
   Oil futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange, paced
by the November gasoline contract, which expires on Tuesday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 26 cents
lower with November at $18.34 a barrel; heating oil was .16 cent
lower to .07 cent higher with November at 57.64 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.17 cents lower to .35 cent higher with
November at 53.45 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade as the corn and soybean markets succumbed to
harvest pressure, pulling wheat down as well.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1} cents lower with December at
$3.96} a bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents lower with December at
$2.41 a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with December at
$1.42} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
November at $5.60{ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures were narrowly mixed on the Chicago Merc,
where the contract for December delivery of the stocks in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled unchanged at 337.20 points.
Each point is worth $500.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Hear Pension Dispute Affecting 30 Million Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS last graf to identify ERISA; No pickup; A longer version

<TEXT>
   Federal protection for 30 million U.S.
workers' pensions could be at stake in a dispute the Supreme Court
agreed to resolve Monday.
   The justices said they will decide what authority the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency, has to order employers to
revive scraped pension plans.
   A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside
the agency's order that LTV Corp. and its subsidiary, LTV Steel
Co., restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $2.3
billion.
   James B. Lockhart, executive director of the PBGC, told
reporters Monday that the lower courts ``misunderstood and
misapplied'' the agency's arguments in finding for LTV. By pursuing
the matter, he said, PBGC is trying to ``prevent future losses from
companies that might want to copycat the LTV-type approach.''
   Government lawyers say the ruling, if not overturned, could make
the agency ``an open-ended source of industry bailouts'' and spark
a financial crisis similar to the one facing the government's
insurance program for the savings and loan industry.
   The justices' decision is expected by next July.
   In other matters Monday, the court:
   _Heard arguments over a challenge to the partial merger of
Detroit's two daily newspapers.
   _Let stand rulings that blocked a Nebraska agency from imposing
mandatory blood testing for AIDS of employees who come into direct
contact with the mentally retarded people the agency serves.
   _Left intact rulings that may let Urbana, Ohio, ban as obscene
five nationally distributed ``adult'' magazines generally not
considered hard-core pornography.
   _Was urged during an oral argument session to strike down as
``taxation without representation'' a federal judge's order that
doubled local property taxes to pay for racially desegregating
Kansas City, Mo., public schools.
   The pensions case focuses on the power of the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., the agency that protects the pension benefits of
the 30 million Americans who participate in single-employer defined
benefit pension plans.
   When a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy
promised benefits, the federal agency becomes the pension plan's
trustee, taking over its assets and liabilities. The agency then
pays all benefits workers had earned as of the date the pension
plan ended.
   In fiscal year 1988, the PBGC paid $324.7 million in insured
benefits to 113,000 retirees who participated in 1,476 terminated
pension plans.
   Dallas-based LTV Corp. and LTV Steel, after filing for
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in 1986, advised the
PBGC that they could not and would not fund the three pension plans
they sponsored. The plans, which have about 100,000 participants,
were terminated in 1987.
   In a deal with the United Steelworkers of America union,
however, LTV Steel agreed to what government lawyers contend is a
``follow-on'' arrangement. Under it, LTV agreed to make up any
benefits lost to employees because of the pension plans'
termination _ those benefits not covered by the federal pension
insurance program.
   The result was employees continued to receive the same benefits
they did before the plans were terminated, and payment of unfunded
pension liabilities shifted to the PBGC.
   The PBGC contends such arrangements are abusive, and the agency
ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the three pension plans.
   When LTV refused, the agency sought to enforce its order in
federal court. A judge ruled that the PBGC lacked the authority to
issue such an order, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld that ruling last May 12.
   The PBGC then sought Supreme Court review, contending that the
appeals court ruling ``places the pension insurance program in
serious financial jeopardy.''
   Justice Department lawyers sided with the PBGC, telling the high
court that last May's ruling ``threatens to undermine ... a program
already seriously in debt.''
   But lawyers for LTV said Congress ``specifically rejected
proposed prohibitions on follow-on plans'' when substantially
amending the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in
1987.

<HEAD>Judge Postpones Fine Against UMW To Let Talks Jell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge spared the United Mine Workers
from another hefty fine Monday to give negotiations mediated by
former Labor Secretary Bill Usery a chance to progress.
   Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin said the union
violated his strike restrictions 84 times in August and September
and said nearly half of the acts were violent. The most blatant act
of defiance he cited occurred last month when 98 union members
invaded Pittston Coal Group's main preparation plant and occupied
the building for four days.
   However, McGlothlin, who previously issued fines totaling $31
million for illegal strike activities directed at Pittston, said he
wanted to avoid any action that could impede progress at the
bargaining table.
   The judge said he would wait until Dec. 8 to decide whether to
impose additional fines.
   ``The court feels there seems to be high hope'' for progress in
contract talks, McGlothlin said in a courtroom filled with striking
miners and supporters. ``It's important to the parties that Mr.
Usery and the negotiators for both sides have the best possible
circumstances to work with.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole last week appointed Usery as a
``super'' mediator in the strike. The walkout, involving Pittston's
1,695 union workers in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, began
April 5.
   Previous talks conducted under the auspices of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service produced virtually no progress.
   McGlothlin also said he wanted his postponement to encourage
striking miners to put an end to violent acts undertaken to disrupt
coal shipments and intimidate replacement workers. The judge said
that for three weeks after the preparation plant takeover,
virtually no violations of strike restrictions were reported.
   Bruce Bratten, a member of the union's negotiating team, said he
was surprised and pleased by McGlothlin's decision. ``I think he's
given the process a chance to work.''
   Pittston attorney Stephen Hodges said, ``If it helps end the
violence, who can complain about that? Not me.''
   Bratten said McGlothlin's previous fines, stretching back to
June, allowed Pittston to stall in contract talks. ``They had a
direct impact on Pittston's desire to negotiate in good faith. The
state court placed economic pressure on the union.''
   McGlothlin heard two days of testimony in a contempt of court
hearing last week and said he wanted to wait until Monday to rule
in order to review the evidence.

<HEAD>Unocal Third-Quarter Earnings Fall 19 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unocal Corp. said Monday its third-quarter
profits fell 19 percent due to escalating costs to produce oil and
gas and lower refining and marketing results.
   For the three-month third period, the Los Angeles-based oil, gas
and coal company earned $79 million, or 67 cents a share, down from
$97 million, or 84 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter.
Revenue rose 8 percent to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion.
   Unocal chairman Richard J. Stegemeier said the quarter's
negative results were partially offset by higher crude oil prices
and improved domestic natural gas production. A $6 million
after-tax gain from the sale of land in Canada, and a $14 million
reduction in deferred income taxes resulting from changes in the
company's state taxes also contributed.
   For the first nine months, Unocal's profits fell 16 percent to
$286 million, or $2.44 per share, from $339 million, or $2.91 a
share. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $8.5 billion from $7.5 billion.

<HEAD>Iacocca: Chrysler Plant or Plants Likely To Close by End of 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least one of Chrysler Corp.'s 12 North
American assembly plants will have to close by the end of next year
and some projects may be delayed as the automaker wrestles with a
smaller market, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca says.
   Iacocca, in an interview published in Monday's Automotive News,
didn't say which plants would be closed, but speculation centers on
the company's St. Louis car plant as being the most likely.
   That plant makes the Dodge Daytona and the Chrysler LeBaron
Coupe and convertible. Last year, when the company renovated its
Newark, Del., plant for Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim
production, it modified tooling to enable it to make the two
LeBarons as well.
   ``You have got too much capacity chasing too few customers in
the richest market in the world,'' Iacocca said. ``It will only be
solved one of two ways. The way we will probably have to do it is
that General Motors, Ford and Chrysler will have to close some
plants. Period.
   ``Or there would be a trade bill, and we would shut our
borders,'' he said. ``But we won't do that and I don't advocate
that.''
   GM plans to idle its Lakewood assembly plant in Georgia in
March. The company already has closed plants in Framingham, Mass.,
and Pontiac, Mich. Ford officials have said they will deal with
overcapacity by trimming overtime, which has been high in some Ford
factories.
   ``We definitely will have to close more than we have closed to
date, which is a 100-year-old plant called Kenosha,'' Iacocca said.
``There is a plant or two that probably will be closed.''
   Chrysler inherited the plant in Kenosha, Wis., when it bought
American Motors Corp.
   Besides the plant closing, Iacocca said some projects may be
delayed, but that the company's new LH and LX car programs will
continue. Cars derived from the two platforms will be introduced in
the early 1990s.
   ``That one is not going to be deferred because it is in the
heart of the market,'' he said, ``and we would like some
strengthening there.''
   Iacocca indicated that the No. 3 U.S. car company may abandon
parts of the automobile or truck market if it determines that it
isn't profitable.
   ``I don't think we can afford to be in every car and truck
segment,'' he said. ``In this world market now, you cannot go it
alone and you cannot be all things to all people. ...
   ``So we're going to have to continue to try to develop car
niches that are profitable to us.''

   The Chicago Board of Trade has levied a $15,000
fine and a 30-day suspension against a commodity options trader
accused of mishandling a customer account.
   The exchange said trader Jeffrey Friedman filled orders
personally instead of using another broker for trades in an account
over which he had discretionary trading authority.
   Friedman agreed to the sanction without or admitting or denying
guilt, the exchange said in a statement issued Friday. The
suspension began Monday.

<HEAD>Shoney's Restructuring to Trim Debt by $4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shoney's Inc. aims to trim its debt by
$4 million in interest charges next year as part of its latest
restructuring in which it will refinance a $410 million debt.
   Shoney's, which has more than 1,500 restaurants nationwide,
borrowed $585 million in a restructuring last year.
   The refinancing reduces the interest on $160 million of the debt
to 9.78 percent from 11.66 percent, and reduces the overall
effective interest rate from 10.66 percent to 10.33 percent, the
company said.
   Also, 94 percent of the debt is now at fixed interest rates, up
from about 60 percent before the refinancing.
   Shoney's has repaid $175 million of the debt this year,
including $54 million in scheduled payments and $121 million in
pre-payments, according to Chief Financial Officer Taylor Henry Jr.
   The debt refinancing will require accelerated write-off for fees
related to the original financing, which will reduce fourth-quarter
earnings by 7 cents per share.
   Shoney's reports year-end earnings in mid-December. Revenues for
1989 are projected to be $45 million ahead of last year's figures,
Henry said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quotron Systems Inc. said Monday it will lay
off 400 of its 2,500 employees because demand for financial
information has plunged due to Wall Street cutbacks and
consolidations since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The layoffs will affect a wide range of job levels at Quotron
offices around the world, said the Los Angeles-based subsidiary of
Citicorp, the New York banking company.
   Quotron provides financial information such as stock prices
through a network of more than 100,000 computer terminals in 23
countries. Its competitors include Telerate Inc., Reuters Holding
PLC and Knight-Ridder Inc.
   Quotron's president and chief executive, J. David Hann, said in
a statement that the layoffs ``will continue to keep operating
expenses in line with revenues in response to changing conditions
in the retail securities industry, which has been contracting since
October 1987.''
   Quotron revenues had been growing at the rate of 25 percent a
year when Citicorp acquired the company two years ago for $680
million, about three times Quotron's annual revenues at that time.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding concern, does not
provide financial results for Quotron.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines will expand its
transatlantic service by 30 percent beginning in 1990 with six new
daily flights between the United States and Europe, officials
announced Monday.
   The new nonstop flights starting in May 1990 include
Chicago-Warsaw, Chicago-Helsinki, Miami-Madrid, Dallas-Barcelona, a
second daily Chicago-Paris flight and a second daily
Chicago-Manchester flight, officials said.
   ``These new flights emphasize American Airlines' commitment to
building a strong European service and continuing the expansion of
our international network,'' said Donald J. Carty, executive vice
president of American.
   The announcement also was made at a news conference at the
International Air Transport Association meeting in Warsaw, Poland.
   Carty said Chicago was targeted as the originating point of four
of the transatlantic flights because of its large Polish population.
   ``Chicago has the largest population of citizens of Polish
heritage in any city except Warsaw, and thus we anticipate a great
deal of personal and pleasure travel,'' Carty said.
   With the new service, American will fly 161 flights a week to 17
European cities. The additions solidify American's position as the
third-largest U.S. transatlantic carrier, behind Pan American World
Airways and Trans World Airlines.
   American is the nation's largest airline. Its parent, AMR Corp.,
recently was the target of a $7 billion takeover proposal from New
York developer Donald Trump.

   Schering-Plough Corp. on Monday announced
that an over-the-counter version of a prescription antifungal drug
that treats athlete's foot and other fungal infections has received
federal approval.
   Lotrimin AF, which is manufactured by Schering-Plough's health
care division, will be the over-the-counter version of Lotrimin, a
prescription drug that also treats topical yeast and fungal
infections, such as jock itch and body ringworm.
   The medicine, which was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration last week, will be introduced to head off generic
forms of Lotrimin AF, which could appear on store shelves when
Schering-Plough's patent expires Dec. 5, said company spokesman
Ronald Asinari.
   Schering-Plough already manufactures Tinactin, a leading topical
antifungal in the general consumer market, Asinari said.
   He said the topical antifungal market has grown at an annual
rate of 12 percent. Worldwide sales of dermatological products
contributed $401 million to Schering-Plough's total sales of $2.97
billion last year, he said.
   Lotrimin AF will be on the market in 1990 and will be available
in cream and liquid forms.

<HEAD>Boeing Reports Strong 3rd Quarter Profits, But Says Strike Will Hurt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `Boeing released ...,' with talks ending for
day.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. enjoyed record third-quarter profits
68 percent higher than in the same period in 1988, but the jet
builder warned Monday that a lingering strike by Machinists will
hurt badly the rest of the year.
   The company also said it is having ``substantial'' losses on
some government and defense programs.
   Boeing released its earnings statement as its negotiators met
with those of the Machinists union in an attempt to end the
four-week-old strike. Six hours of talks produced only an agreement
to meet again Tuesday.
   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, who called Monday's session,
said he hoped to keep the two sides at the table until a new
contract offer can be worked out.
   Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz said the higher profits for the
quarter and first nine months were due mostly to higher sales
volume and lower research, development and other new business costs
for commercial aircraft and computing.
   But he said that performance was partially offset by losses and
higher research and development costs for defense programs, and a
higher effective federal tax rate.
   Net earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 were $242 million,
or $1.05 a share, on revenue of $6.36 billion, compared with
profits of $144 million, or 63 cents a share, on revenue of $3.72
billion a year earlier.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said both profits and sales for the
most recent quarter were records for the company.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Boeing's profits were $598
million, or $2.60 a share, on revenue of $15.43 billion, compared
with net earnings of $440 million, or $1.92 a share, on revenue of
$12.09 billion.
   ``While that looks good at first glance, closer inspection
indicates our net profit was only 3.9 percent'' for the first nine
months, Binder said.
   ``Our profit margin is approximately 1 percent less than the
average of all U.S. manufacturing companies and we simply must do
better to remain competitive.''
   Union spokesman Jack Daniels read it differently: ``That falls
into line with our contention that their profits indicate they
should make a better offer to the Machinists union.''
   Stock analysts said Boeing's performance was about what they
anticipated, although they took special note of the downbeat
forecasts for defense work and strike effects.
   ``That's the first time I've seen any indication they feel there
will be a severe impact on the fourth quarter,'' said Paul Nisbet
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``At the end of the second quarter, they mentioned matter of
factly that the company's defense and space programs would not be
profitable at the end of 1989,'' said William Deatherage, analyst
at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``Now they're saying it's
a significant loss.''
   Boeing announced on Friday a major reorganization of its defense
division.
   The third-quarter figures don't show effects of the strike by
about 57,800 union Machinists who walked out Oct. 4 after rejecting
a 3-year contract offer.
   ``The strike by the Machinists union will have a serious adverse
impact on fourth-quarter sales and earnings and on the company's
cash and short-term investment position,'' Shrontz said in the
earnings statement.
   That was one of the strongest acknowledgments from Boeing about
damages from the strike, which has severely slowed aircraft
deliveries.
   When the strike began, Boeing had hoped to deliver another 94
aircraft by the end of the year. So far, it has delivered only 15.

   Mitsubishi Estate Co., a major Japanese real
estate concern, announced Monday it will buy 51 percent of
Rockefeller Group Inc., the private real estate and entertainment
company controlled by descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr.
   The $846 million cash purchase will give Mitsubishi majority
control of Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc., the Cushman &amp;
Wakefield Inc. real estate firm and Rockefeller Center, the
landmark, 22-acre Manhattan development built by Rockefeller.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members, who control
the company through trusts, wanted more income from their
investments. Most of the family members' inheritance is tied up in
real estate and other corporate holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
trusts said the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other company operations. William G. Bowen, chairman
of the trust committee, said one objective of the sale was to
diversify the company's holdings, which are concentrated in real
estate.
   ``Our agreement with Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding
commitment to Rockefeller Center and New York City, which my father
made more than 50 years ago, and which present generations of the
family continue to feel,'' David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's
chairman, said in a statement.
   Richard A. Voell, Rockefeller Group's president and chief
executive, said the purchase of the 627,000 shares in the company
by Mitsubishi ``ensures the company's ability to continue to invest
in Rockefeller Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and
prestigious commercial complex.''
   He said Rockefeller Group's board, its advisers and the trust
committee considered other options, such as a recapitalization
funded by debt, before they decided on the sale.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust. The company also manages Rockefeller
Center.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller,
founder of Standard Oil Co., and was estimated at $900 million by
1911.
   His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five trusts for his
children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal owners of
Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr. the
main beneficiaries.
   The Rockefeller Center complex includes the General Electric
Building, formerly known as the RCA building, Radio City Music Hall
and the Time-Life building.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which the company
holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate is one of Japan's largest real estate
companies. Its other major U.S. investments include partnerships
that built a $500 million office building at Citicorp Plaza in Los
Angeles and a 2,300-acre resort complex at Palm Desert, Calif.
