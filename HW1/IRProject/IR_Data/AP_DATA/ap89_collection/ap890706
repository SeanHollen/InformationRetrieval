   Two Puerto Rican hit men who may have
killed as many as 40 people in their homeland were behind bars
Thursday, police said.
   Carlos Ortiz Quinones, 23, and Fernando Garcia Marquez, 21, were
arrested Wednesday, and were in the Dade County Jail in Miami
without bond while authorities awaited extradition papers from
Puerto Rico, said police Sgt. Tom Hunker.
   ``These guys were pretty cold. They admitted to killing a lot of
people,'' Hunker said. ``They said they were just killing insects _
not really people.''
   A special police squad accompanied by federal agents surrounded
Ortiz and Garcia on a street here as they prepared to buy a
silencer, Hunker said.
   The pair had been under surveillance for some time, but officers
did not initially known how many crimes they were wanted for.
   Police said Ortiz and Garcia may have killed two members of a
rival gang in Puerto Rico within the last two months.
   They were charged with first-degree murder in Puerto Rico in the
1987 shooting death of a police officer, and are wanted for other
killings, Hunker said.
   Ramon Ortiz, head of the Police Criminal Investigations unit in
Ponce, Puerto Rico, said Thursday that Puerto Rican police would ask
the two be returned to Puerto Rico.
   ``The arrest of these thugs is the best news we've heard in a
long time,'' he said. ``We're going to request the extradition of
these gunslingers because they are implicated in more than 10
murders.''
   He said the two are also suspected of taking part in the November
1987 killing of Ponce policeman Roberto Santos Lopez, brother of
Wilfredo Santos Lopez, a congressman in Puerto Rico's legislature.
   The two men, who have been living in Miami Beach in recent
months, were working with the Wasps gang in Ponce in an effort to
wipe out the rival Las Martinez gang, Hunker said.
   ``These guys are implicated in up to 40 murders,'' he said.
``Whenever their bosses needed a contract killing, they'd go down
there, do it and come back.''
   Besides talking freely with police about many of their crimes,
Carlos Ortiz and Quinones kept Puerto Rican newspapers in their room
with front-page accounts of many slayings, Hunker said.
   ``These guys are definitely some of the worst I've seen in 17
years as a police officer here,'' said Hunker. ``They were bragging.
They showed off their bullet holes _ they're young and they're kind
of wild.''
   One of the suspects told police he started killing when his
12-year-old brother was killed during a gang war over cocaine, the
officer added.
   Garcia, who police said escaped from a maximum-security prison in
Puerto Rico, is charged in Puerto Rico with three first-degree
murders and two armed robberies. Ortiz is charged with first-degree
murder.

<HEAD>No Proof of Miracle, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There is ``no convincing evidence'' a life-size
statue of Christ closed its eyes during a Good Friday church
service, according to a report issued Wednesday by the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh.
   Before and after photographs of the crucifix at Holy Trinity
Church in Ambridge appear virtually the same, said the report by a
commission appointed by Bishop Donald Wuerl to study the alleged
miracle.
   Thousands of the faithful and the curious visited the white,
concrete church about 15 miles northwest of Pittsburgh after hearing
reports the eyes, which appeared as small slits, partially closed
March 24 then returned to normal a few days later.
   Although no one reported seeing the lids moving, witnesses said
they were about one-third open when the plaster crucifix was
suspended 15 feet above the altar in January. During the special
three-hour prayer meeting, worshipers and the church's pastor, the
Rev. Vincent Cvitkovic, said they noticed they had closed.
   The commission reviewed written reports, interviewed six
witnesses and looked over other photographs taken by an independent
agency the diocese refused to name.
   ``Although the witnesses testified to what they had perceived, a
careful examination of the photographs provided by Holy Trinity
Church as well as those photographs independently commissioned shows
no convincing evidence that a miracle has occurred,'' the report
said.
   State police trooper Chris Marion, a Holy Trinity parshioner,
last month claimed he saw the eyes close briefly again as a
television crew re-enacted the Good Friday incident.
   Marion said the figure opened its eyes after he climbed a ladder
under the crucifix during filming of NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries''
series.
   Cvitkovic later said he saw nothing of the second incident and
told church officials nothing happened. The commission did not
investigate the second incident.
   Commission members said they don't doubt the sincerity of the
witnesses interviewed, but believe they could have been fooled by
the church's lighting and the different angles from which they
observed the crucifix.
   The commission is neither encouraging nor discouraging the belief
the eyes closed, Winter said. ``Our job was to try to verify if a
miracle occurred,'' he said. ``We could not.''
   Cvitkovic remains on leave for ``four to six weeks of rest,
reflection and prayer,'' said the Rev. Paul Maslach of Chicago, who
heads Cvitkovic's order, The Croatian Franciscans.
   Cvitkovic is not being punished for talking about the event,
Maslach said. The priest was exhausted by the work required when
scores of worshipers began visiting the church to see the crucifix,
he said.

<HEAD>Kraft Announces Number of Winners in Botched Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft is getting ready to roll out its
wallet now that it has tallied the number of customers who submitted
winning entries in its botched ``Ready to Roll'' promotion, a
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   About 21,000 matched game-piece sets were received by Friday's
deadline, spokeswoman Kathy Knuth said, including about 10,000 for
what was to have been the contest's ``one and only'' grand prize _ a
$17,000 Dodge van.
   ``We had originally estimated this (alternate payout) plan would
cost $3 million to $4 million,'' she said. ``That is still
accurate.''
   A promotional insert in June 11 newspapers in the Chicago and
Houston metropolitan areas carried the right half of four game
pieces for ``Ready to Roll.''
   Specially marked packages of Kraft cheese contained a left half,
and under the original terms of the contest, matched pairs could be
redeemed for one of 8,000 packages of cheese; one of 500
skateboards; one of 100 bicycles; or at odds of 15-million-to-1, a
1990 Dodge Caravan LE.
   Kraft learned the contest was botched just hours after the Sunday
newspapers were on the streets, when several hundred customers
called to claim the van.
   Kraft, facing the likelihood of more ``Ready to Roll'' winners
than losers, immediately declared the contest null and void and
ordered the specially marked packages of cheese pulled from store
shelves.
   On June 15, the company, formally called Kraft General Foods
Group of Philip Morris, offered to quadruple the number of prizes
originally offered and add cash prizes and special drawings.
   The proposal came after the company entered into agreements of
``voluntary compliance'' with the attorneys general of Illinois and
Texas.
   Several angry players filed class-action lawsuits despite Kraft's
claims that it could not be held liable for the prizes. And several
of the winners said they would press on with the litigation despite
Kraft's offer to sweeten the pot.
   Under the new payout plan, players who matched game pieces for
the van and submitted them by Friday's deadline will receive $250
and be eligible for a July 14 drawing, in which four vans will be
awarded.
   Similarly, each player who matched game pieces for a bicycle will
receive $50, skateboard winners $25, and cheese winners $5. Those
players also will be eligible for prizes in the drawings.
   Ms. Knuth said Wednesday an exact breakdown was not yet
available, but that about 25 percent of the 21,000 winning entries
mailed to the company were for bicycles; 20 percent for skateboards;
and 10 percent for cheese.

<HEAD>East German Guards Do Not Open Fire As Man Flees Over Wall to West</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist border guards ordered a 24-year-old East
German man to halt as he scaled the Berlin Wall, but did not fire on
him when he defied them and went on to reach the West, West Berlin
police said.
   The escape Wednesday came just one day after Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's chief of staff said East German officials had told him border
guards had been ordered not to use deadly force.
   Rudolf Seiters said East German leader Erich Honecker informed
him of the policy during his visit to East Berlin on Tuesday. He
said Honecker assured him that deadly force would only be used in
cases of ``self-defense or desertion.''
   The last shooting incident occurred on April 8, when communist
border guards opened fire on two men attempting to scale the Berlin
Wall.
   Eyewitnesses said the men were led away, apparently uninjured.
   In a March 10 escape attempt, shots fired by Communist border
guards hit and seriously wounded one of three men attempting to flee.
   On Feb. 6, a 22-year-old East German was killed when he tried to
scale the Wall with a ladder.
   According to the West Berlin-based Working Group August 13, a
private organization that monitors events in East Germany, at least
191 people have been killed trying to escape from East Germany since
1961.
   The group is named after the date the Berlin Wall was erected.

   Workers replacing Juneau's public pool have
confirmed what city officials feared: The lining of the 16-year-old
pool was full of holes.
   The pool was losing more than 10,000 gallons a day because of the
holes, formed in the aluminum lining by reaction to other metals in
the rock and fill surrounding the tank, city recreation director Jim
Dumont said Wednesday.
   ``It would be like turning your garden hose on at home and
letting it run for 24 hours,'' Dumont said.
   The extra water needed to keep the covered pool full cost the
city about $15 a day, plus the expense of additional chemicals and
heating.
   The new pool will cost about $1.29 million. Dumont said the
lining will be made of concrete.
   ``We're thinking of putting the aluminum samples in the display
case by the Assembly chambers so people can see how much damage was
done,'' Dumont said.

   ``Here kitty, kitty,'' just
didn't do the job.
   Five boys who spent four days trying to free a kitten from a
drainage pipe finally found a means of rescue: tying pieces of fish
to a badminton net and lowering it into the pipe.
   Attracted by the fish, the kitten climbed onto the net and the
boys pulled her out. She was 12 feet down the pipe, said Sharon
Pittman, mother of four of the boys.
   The children dubbed the kitten Baby Jessica Too, in honor of
Jessica McClure, the Texas girl who was trapped in an abandoned well
for 2{ days in 1987.
   The rescue effort began Saturday after 5-year-old Cory Pittman
heard the kitten's cry. The kitten was pulled out Tuesday.
   Cory's 13-year-old brother, Tommy, said his family gave up a
holiday trip to help the kitten, but they didn't mind.
   ``We saved an animal's life. That's what counts,'' he said. ``We
wanted to save it and now we are going to nurse it back to health.''

   T.R. Benker may not be the funniest comedian in
the world. But he has staked a claim as the most persistent.
   Benker capped a 72-hour joke-telling marathon Tuesday night back
where he began it three days earlier _ onstage at Bally's Catch a
Rising Star comedy club.
   In between, he told jokes on the radio, outside a casino and over
breakfast in coffee shops.
   The Guinness Book of World Records lists 50 hours as the longest
continuous joke-telling session.
   It was the Chicago comedian's sixth joke-telling marathon. And it
was most likely his last.
   ``Never, ever again,'' Benker said Wednesday. ``I can't even
remember my mom's name today.'' He didn't sleep the entire time and
had a five-minute break each hour.
   Audience reaction depended on the audience.
   ``I might tell a joke one hour and people would just kind of
stand there and do nothing,'' he said. ``An hour later I'd tell it
again and people would laugh their buns off.''
   Benker said he hoped his marathon did something to his career.
   ``This was the big one for someone to discover or manage me or
else to put me away,'' he said.

   A Soviet military plane on a training
flight collided with a glider, killing the glider pilot, the
state-run news agency PAP reported.
   The collision occurred Wednesday near the city of Lubin, 290
miles southwest of Warsaw, the agency said, quoting a Defense
Ministry spokesman.
   The PAP report did not name the type of Soviet plane involved and
said its pilot landed safely at his home airport. The agency did not
say where the flight originated.
   ``The reasons for the accident will be investigated by a special
commission with the participation of Polish and Soviet military
experts,'' PAP said.
   On Tuesday, A Soviet MiG-23 jet, also on a training mission, flew
pilotless 560 mile across Europe before crashing into a house in
Belgium, killing a man.
   The pilot of that jet bailed out after takeoff from the Kolobrzeg
airfield in Poland when the plane developed a mechanical problem,
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov told the Soviet news agency
Tass on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos, sharing exile in Hawaii
with her ailing husband Ferdinand, says the worst disease cannot
compare with homesickness.
   The wife of the former president made the statement in an
interview made in Honolulu and broadcast today by radio station DZBB.
   Mrs. Marcos said she was willing to reconcile with President
Corazon Aquino, who ousted her husband during a civilian-backed
military uprising in 1986, if the Marcoses are allowed to return
home.
   ``I can stay for a day, for an hour,'' said Mrs. Marcos. ``Just
to see my country, even a minute would do because I'm very homesick.
I found out that there is no disease that can compare with
homesickness.''
   ``Of all the most difficult things to bear, it's homesickness.
You don't know what's happening to your heart. You don't know if
it's bursting or whatever.'' she added. ``It's difficult. If you are
not in your country, you are like a tree that has been uprooted.''
   ``I'm like a tree which has been bearing flowers and fruits and
then I'm made to stop growing,'' said Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow the Marcoses to return, citing
national security. She has also refused to allow Marcos,
hospitalized since January, to be buried in his homeland if he dies
in Honolulu.
   During the interview, Mrs. Marcos accused the U.S. government of
``kidnapping'' her family and forcing them to stay in Honolulu.
   Marcos remained in very critical condition Wednesday battling
widespread infection after the removal last week of a
non-functioning, transplanted kidney, said Norma Kop, spokeswoman of
the St. Francis Medical Center.
   The Marcoses have been indicted by a U.S. court for allegedly
stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury and
stashing it in the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $5
million bail. Marcos has been separated from the case because of his
illness.

   Police in riot gear and East Village residents
faced off Wednesday night after dozens of homeless people were
evicted from Tompkins Square Park.
   The homeless were evicted because of a new city regulation took
effect Wednesday banning residential structures, such as tents, from
city parks.
   Later, hundreds of East Villagerfs began surrounding the park as
police wearing helmets with visors tried to keep the entrances to
the park blocked.
   The mood was tense but there were no immediate reports of
widespread clashes. There were some reports of bottle-throwing.
   Earlier, about 100 people shouting ``It's our park!'' staged an
impromptu march around the park as the raid got underway.
   The homeless people apparently did not resist and police reported
no arrests.
   Dozens of homeless people live in the park, which was the site of
a seven-hour riot last Aug. 7, when police tried to enforce a curfew
that was later revoked. Fifty-two police officers and 18 civilians
required hospital treatment after the clash; 115 complaints of
police brutality were filed.
   The controversial regulation that went into effect Wednesday was
proposed by the Department of Parks and Recreation and had been
opposed by homeless people and advocates for the homeless.
   Alan Moss, a Parks Department deputy commissioner, was at the
park while the eviction was carried out and said: ``This is not
aimed at the homeless who have been using parks. It is aimed at
getting rid of permanent structures. When you see a big spike being
driven into a tree and boards being nailed together, that doesn't
belong in a park.''
   He said the new rule would not stop a homeless person from
sleeping on a park bench or on the grass.
   Human Resources Administration workers were on the scene with
vans so that those who wanted could go to city shelters.
   The raid began at about 8:30 p.m.

<HEAD>Ostriches Barred Entry After Ticks Found</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Live ostriches have been denied entry into the
United States by the Agriculture Department because African ticks
that can carry livestock disease recently were found on some of the
imported birds.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said 18 ticks _ identified as
African Bont ticks and Bont-legged ticks _ were found on two
imported ostriches in Andrews and Quinlan, Texas, in late May.
   Some of the exotic ticks also were found later on adult ostriches
in Ohio and Oklahoma, he said Wednesday.
   The USDA announced June 19 that African ticks had been detected
on shipments of ostriches and told livestock producers to be on the
alert.
   Bont ticks are known to transmit heartwater, a disease of cattle,
sheep, goats and other ruminants. However, Glosser said the ticks
removed from the ostriches are not known to transmit any human
diseases.
   ``So far, there is no evidence that the ticks have spread to U.S.
livestock,'' he said.
   Glosser said his agency ``is reviewing inspection methods and
quarantine facility standards to determine if other action is needed
to prevent additional pests from entering the United States.''
   He said the ostriches were in a shipment of 44 adult birds
imported from Zimbabwe on April 2. Twenty-five survived and were
released 30 days later from a privately owned, USDA-approved
quarantine facility in Mundelein, Ill. Those were sent to cities in
Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas.
   Glosser said 50 ostrich chicks from Tanzania also were imported
Jan. 25 and that 45 survivors were released from a private
quarantine facility in Schaumburg, Ill. They went to dealers in
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South
Carolina and Texas.
   No ticks were found on the ostrich chicks.
   ``Animal health officials placed the infested premises under
state quarantine, identified all the ostriches and are treating the
birds and soil every 14 days with a pesticide used to control
livestock ticks,'' Glosser said.
   ``Other birds or animals that may have had contact with the
ostriches or those immediately adjacent to the birds are being
examined for ticks and treated,'' he said. ``If no ticks are found,
the state or federal veterinarian will lift the quarantine and
continue a tick surveillance for six months.''
   Glosser said rabbits, birds, steers and other ``sentinel''
animals are being placed on all farm premises with the adult
ostriches to see if the ticks are still a threat to domestic
animals. Agency health officials also are trapping wildlife on the
farms to check for ticks.
   Heartwater affects the heart, lymph nodes and brain of livestock,
causing muscle twitching, diarrhea, convulsions and death.
   Glosser said the ticks are reddish-orange or dark brown and
commonly attach themselves to the neck, udder, hoof or tail area of
livestock.

   A preliminary report by the Agriculture
Department shows farmers spent $118.4 billion on production expenses
last year, up 7.5 percent from $110.1 billion in 1987.
   Despite the increase, 1988 expenditures were still far below the
record level of $131.8 billion in 1981, just before the general
financial crunch that stalled expansion in the nation's agricultural
sector
   By 1986, annual spending by farmers dropped to less than $106
billion, indicating massive cutbacks in capital investments as land
values plummeted and debts burdened many.
   According to the report issued Wednesday by the department's
National Agricultural Statistics Service, 1988 expenditures were
higher for all major categories except interest, which decreased 3.7
percent to $8.37 billion, and building and fencing, which dropped
10.3 percent to $2.23 billion.
   Farm services, which include rent, accounted for the largest 1988
expenditures by farmers, totaling $24.6 billion, or 21 percent of
the total. That was up 2.7 percent from 1987.
   Spending on feed for livestock totaled $17.9 billion, rising 20
percent from 1987 and accounting for 15 percent of last year's total.
   Overall, 1988 production expenditures averaged $54,956 per farm,
an increase of $4,165 from 1987, the report said.
   The analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not
include figures for net income or profits.

   F. Paul Dickerson, a veteran of the private
grain trade, has been appointed general sales manager and associate
administrator of the Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural
Service.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Wednesday that
Dickerson's 27 years of marketing and trading experience in the
United States and abroad ``makes him a natural to carry out the
demanding duties'' of the sales manager.
   Dickerson most recently was a consultant and marketing agent in
the Pacific Northwest, Yeutter said. From 1978 to 1986, he was
president and chief operating officer of Columbia Grain Co., of
Portland, Ore. Before that, beginning in 1967, he worked for Cook
Industries Inc., in Portland; Memphis, Tenn.; and Tokyo.
   From 1960 to 1967, Dickerson worked for Cargill Inc. He is a
native of Inglewood, Calif.
   As the agency's general sales manager, Dickerson will be
responsible for administering foreign market development activities,
export credit programs and the Food for Peace aid program.

<TEXT>
   The beginning of the end to Angola's
14-year civil war looked promising.
   But less than two weeks after President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos
and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi sealed a cease-fire with an historic
handshake at an African summit in neighboring Zaire, talks between
the government and rebels have collapsed.
   Now, peace seems further away than when the guns fell silent on
June 24.
   Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, is scheduled to arrive in Luanda on Friday to survey the
situation.
   He said Monday in South Africa that he expected a final
settlement in Angola before the end of the year. ``There have been
some tremendously important developments in Angola, and I believe
it's on the right track,'' he told a news conference.
   The United States, which has been providing UNITA with some $15
million a year in military aid since 1985, has never recognized
Angola since it gained independence from Portugal in November 1975.
   Although Cohen is not expected to announce the establishment of
formal diplomatic relations with Angola, diplomats in Luanda say a
low-level U.S. representation could soon be sent to the capital.
   Acknowledging political difficulties between the two countries,
Dos Santos has said he hoped for ``understanding and realism'' from
the United States:
   ``We hope that now another climate has been established in
southern Africa, we can draw the lines that will lead us to a
normalization with the United States.''
   An Angolan government delegation walked out of talks with UNITA,
short for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
in Kinshasa, Zaire, on Friday. Angola accused the rebels of killing
more than a dozen people in attacks on civilian convoys and of
sabotaging Luanda's power supplies in violation of the cease-fire
signed in Gbadolite, Zaire.
   In a statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, UNITA said news of
the cease-fire is taking time to trickle down to their fighters
spread around this nation, which is twice the size of France.
   The rebels also insist their leader is not contemplating exile,
although Savimbi's reported acceptance of a ``temporary and
voluntary'' stay abroad, far from Angolan politics, was one
pre-condition for talks stated by the Angolan government.
   Dos Santos, following a meeting Monday with President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso of the Congo in the Congolese town of Pointe Noire,
told reporters that ``the cease-fire violations must stop ... so a
favorable environment is created for the re-integration of UNITA
members into Angolan society and institutions.''
   He ruled out any power-sharing agreement leading to a multiparty
system.
   Sources close to the government said the Gbadolite summit caught
government and rebels off guard and both sides are now unsure of
their next moves.
   Speaking on Angolan radio from Pointe Noire, Dos Santos described
the process that led to the Gbadolite summit of 20 African heads of
state as ``hurried'' and said it was originally scheduled for August.
   President Mobutu Sese Sekou of Zaire, a UNITA backer and
self-appointed moderator in the Angolan peace talks, is believed to
have pushed the summit forward so it would occur before his official
visit to Washington last week.
   ``Mobutu told the Angolan government Savimbi was ready to accept
their peace plan,'' a resident African diplomat said. ``But it looks
like a lot of things still have to be sorted out.''
   The diplomat dismissed as ``mere rumors'' published reports that
the Angolan government had offered UNITA three ministerial posts and
four provincial governerships.
   ``A first priority should be somehow getting their troops
separated and a monitoring, demilitarized zone set up,'' a Western
diplomat said. ``Then there's the problem of integrating the rebels
into the Angolan armed forces.'' Since January, 70 United Nations
monitors have been in Angola to oversee the phased withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops deployed in the country to help Angola fight the
guerrillas.
   According to the terms of a U.S.-brokered December 22 agreement
signed in New York by South Africa, Cuba and Angola, all the Cuban
troops are to have pulled back beyond the 13th parallel by August 1
and are to be out of the country by mid-1991.
   Cohen is slated to meet with Angolan, Cuban and South African
officials who form the commission monitoring progress of the
agreement.
   UNITA has been fighting the Cuban-and Soviet-aided Marxist
government since Angola's independence.
   Shortly before his inauguration in January, President Bush wrote
to Savimbi pledging continued military support, but Western
diplomats here say the tide could be turning.
   Diplomats say Dos Santos, a 47-year-old Soviet-trained petroleum
engineer, could face resistance to a settlement with UNITA from
within his own ruling party.
   Rumors of coup plots have buzzed around the capital since early
this year.
   But since he succeeded Agostinho Neto in 1979, Dos Santos has
surprised many observers by clamping down on party infighting and
has systematically concentrated more power in the presidency while
easing out Marxist hard-liners.

   Heavy rain drenched the East Coast on Wednesday, causing
widespread flooding with eight inches of rain in New Jersey, and 10
inches in Maryland.
   The heat continued in the desert Southwest, where temperatures
near 110 degrees were recorded in parts of Arizona and California.
   Showers stretched along the Atlantic Coast from the Carolinas to
New York. Two people, including a 9-year-old boy, drowned and more
than 450 people were evacuated because of flooding in northern
Delaware.
   Salem County, N.J., was deluged with eight inches of rain and
southern Anne Arundel County, Md., had 10 inches. The National
Weather Service initially reported 20 inches fell in southeastern
Bucks County, Pa., and in the Philadelphia area, but revised that
report to 2.8 inches. It also revised lower an initial report of 13
inches of rain in Monroe, N.J.
   Heavy rain flooded tracks and disrupted Amtrak passenger service
along the railroad's busy northeast corridor. Busing and long delays
affected nearly 10,000 passengers, a spokesman said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 6.28 inches at Mt. Holly, N.J.; 5.7 inches at Wrightstown,
N.J.; 4.8 inches at downtown Philadelphia; 2.3 inches at Newark,
N.J.; 1.5 inches at Wilmington, Del.; and 1.2 inches at New York
City's Kennedy Airport.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Arcata Crescent City, Calif., to 112 degrees at Pierre,
S.D. Wednesday's low in the Lower 48 states was 26 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
middle and south Atlantic Coast states, the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys, the Gulf Coast states to southern and eastern Texas; and
widely scattered thunderstorms across northern Minnesota, northwest
Wisconsin and western upper Michigan.
   Highs were predicted in the 70s over western Washington and along
much of the Pacific Coast; 80s to lower 90s across most of the
nation; between 95 and 105 degrees from the central Plains to South
Dakota and southern Minnesota; 95 to 105 degrees over the Great
Basin and interior valleys of California, New Mexico and southwest
Texas; and between 105 to 120 degrees in the desert Southwest.

   Emmy Award-winning actor James Woods, and his
new wife, horse trainer Sarah Owens, are honeymooning in the English
countryside, a spokeswoman said.
   About 200 people, including actors James Garner, Robert Downey
Jr. and Piper Laurie and musicians Don Henley and Bob Seger,
attended the weekend wedding at the Greystone Mansion here, said
spokeswoman Jasmine Madatian.
   Woods, 42, wrote the couple's vows. The 26-year-old bride wore
her great-great-great-grandmother's wedding dress, complete with a
6-foot-train and 8-foot veil, Ms. Madatian said.
   Woods was nominated for an Academy Award in 1986 for the movie
``Salvador'' and garnered an Emmy for the 1986 TV Hallmark Hall of
Fame special, ``Promise,'' in which he played the schizophrenic
brother of Garner's character.

   Emmy Award-winning actress Tyne Daly, best
known for her work on the small screen, isn't afraid of thinking
big, even if it means belting out songs to 12,000 people in an
outdoor amphitheater.
   ``It's like being a Christian in the Roman circus,'' the former
``Cagney and Lacey'' star said in a recent telephone interview from
St. Louis, where she played Rose in the classic musical ``Gypsy.''
   ``When you're doing something, you have to give it grandeur,''
she said. ``I don't think you could make something good unless you
give it pretensions.''
   The 30th anniversary production of ``Gypsy'' opened Wednesday
night at the Los Angeles Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
for a two-week run.
   The musical, which will head for New York in November, is
directed by Arthur Laurents, who wrote the musical's book.

   Former President Reagan, back at a
Mexican ranch after a riding accident that put him in a Army
hospital, underwent a follow-up examination, a spokeswoman said.
   Reagan, 78, is sore but in excellent condition, Margaret
Liebchen, a spokeswoman at Fort Huachuca here, said after
Wednesday's examination.
   Dr. Juan Lopez, who treated Reagan at the base, flew into
northern Mexico to examine the former president, she said.
   Reagan, an accomplished rider, was thrown by a bucking horse
Tuesday at a privately owned ranch near Cananea, about 30 miles
south of the border. He was flown by U.S. Army helicopter to Raymond
W. Bliss Army Community Hospital.
   Reagan was discharged after four hours and returned by helicopter
to Mexico with his wife, Nancy, Secret Service agents and the
hospital's chief nurse, who returned to the post Wednesday.
   The Reagans are staying at a ranch owned by William Wilson, a
friend and former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.

   The designer Halston was mentioned 98 times and
Bianca Jagger 84, but Yogi Berra, Idi Amin and Dick Tracy got only
one mention apiece.
   They are among the 2,338 names dropped in ``The Andy Warhol
Diaries,'' according to Fame magazine, which said Wednesday it had
compiled the first complete index to the diaries and will publish
the list in its September issue.
   Until now, there's been no substitute for reading the entire
807-page book to learn whether one's name was mentioned in Warhol's
diary of his social encounters from 1976 to 1987.
   Many of the names in the book were dropped dozens of times, Fame
found. One top name was artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, who got 111
mentions.

   To Patsy Kensit, a love scene with Mel Gibson
was simply ``a nice experience.''
   For the 21-year-old British actress, who appears opposite Gibson
in ``Lethal Weapon II,'' acting is serious business, and the
romantic scene in a beachside trailer was just part of the job.
   ``It's probably the most unromantic situation you'll ever find
yourself in,'' she said. But ``even though we were acting, it was a
nice experience,'' Miss Kensit said in a recent interview.
   Appearing in one of the summer's big-budget sequels might be the
high point of a young actress' career, but again Miss Kensit was
unimpressed.
   Movies are only half her professional life. The other half _
singing in the London pop band Eighth Wonder _ she finds more
exciting and rewarding.
   ``You make a movie, my experience is you're working for someone.
My experience with the band is we work for ourselves,'' she said.

   Hank Williams Sr.'s illegitimate daughter
should share in royalties worth millions of dollars from songs
written by the late country music singer, the state Supreme Court
ruled.
   In its 5-2 decision Wednesday, the court said Cathy Deupree
Adkinson's interests were not properly represented when Williams'
estate was settled 21 years ago.
   The court said Mrs. Adkinson, a budding country singer from
Washington, D.C., can share in the royalties from the time she filed
her initial claim on Aug. 5, 1985.
   Her attorney, David Cromwell Johnson, estimated the royalties
from such songs as ``Your Cheatin' Heart'' and ``Kowliga'' are worth
at least $500,000 a year and maybe up to a million dollars a year.
   ``For 35 years of her life, she's got the short end of the
stick,'' Johnson said. ``But in the last two weeks, she's won major
victories.''
   The ruling came one week after Mrs. Adkinson reached an
out-of-court settlement of her separate lawsuit seeking a share of
the $600,000 estate of her adopted mother in Mobile.

   A pyrotechnician ignored his horoscope
warning and went ahead with a July Fourth fireworks display because
in the best show business tradition, the show must go on.
   Bruce Olson, who works for Western Enterprises of Enid, Okla.,
was contracted to do the annual fireworks display at Dick Bivins
Memorial Stadium.
   His horoscope for Tuesday said: ``Avoid setting off fireworks.''
   Olson, an Aries, paid no heed to the stars and went on with the
show, but not without a hitch. A 6-inch shell fired prematurely,
scattering debris in the firing area and forcing a 10-minute delay.
No one was injured.
   Fortunately, the shell had been kept away from the others. That's
the only thing that kept the show from opening with the grand
finale, Olson said.

<HEAD>Administration Backs Rule Allowing U.S. Airliner Repairs Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is supporting a rule
allowing U.S. airlines to use foreign repair shops, but some members
of Congress are concerned safety might be compromised.
   Aircraft and parts manufacturers and some domestic carriers
support the foreign repair rule, which went into effect last
December. They say it promotes good trade relations, enhances safety
by making more repair facilities available, and, in the long run,
saves U.S. jobs.
   The rule allows U.S. airlines to fly any of their planes to any
country for repairs as long as the facility is certified by the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   Several foreign governments pushed for the rule change after the
FAA started to crack down on airlines that were violating a 1949 law
prohibiting foreign repair of airliners used in domestic service.
   Two bills in the House would rescind the new rule and reimpose
the former prohibitions, with some exceptions for foreign-made
planes and parts used by U.S. airlines. Maintenance bases set up by
U.S. airlines abroad also would not be affected since they are
regulated as domestic facilities.
   ``I believe that allowing maintenance of U.S. domestic aircraft
by foreign concerns raises both problems of accountability and
serious questions of FAA's ability to stay on top of a rapidly
changing industry,'' said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., sponsor of a
bill to rescind the rule.
   Mineta told a House Public Works and Transportation aviation
subcommittee hearing last week that the growth of foreign repair
stations will tax the FAA's limited number of inspectors abroad.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said the measure threatens the
livelihood of people who work in 4,000 domestic repair facilities.
   ``It's no secret that many U.S. airlines will jump at the chance
to lower their maintenance costs by taking advantage of low wages
abroad,'' said Synar.
   But the FAA said there is no evidence this is happening.
   ``There has been no signficant change in the way U.S. airlines
are having maintenance work performed by foreign repair stations
under the new rule,'' the agency said in a report to Congress.
   ``There is no fundamental difference between domestic and foreign
repair stations other than geography,'' FAA associate administrator
Anthony J. Broderick said in congressional testimony.
   Broderick said the global nature of the air transportation
industry prompted the more liberal rule. He said the FAA would take
``no shortcuts'' in certifying foreign repair facilities and would
not certify more than it can monitor with FAA inspectors.
   The agency watches over 200 certified repair facilities abroad.
The domestic and foreign facilities range from small companies doing
limited work on individual aircraft parts to large plants that do
complete overhauls of large passenger jets and engines.
   The Commerce Department also testified in support of the new
rule, saying the United States enjoys a large positive balance in
repair station work done for foreign airlines in the United States.
   ``In the view of our trading partners, the proposed legislation
is discriminatory and invites retaliatory action,'' warned Linda F.
Powers, deputy assistant Commerce secretary.
   Robert Peel of the Association of European Airlines said the
association's 21 airline members did $29 million worth of repair
work on U.S.-registered airliners last year but spent $84 million at
U.S. repair stations.
   At least two major airlines _ United and American _ have joined
their union workers in saying they would like to see restrictions on
foreign repairs.
   Among reasons given for opposing the new rule are that foreign
mechanics are not subject to drug testing, that personnel at the
facilities would not be certified by the FAA and that language
differences would hinder communications and safety.
   ``The lure of being able to perform routine maintenance and
repairs for any U.S. registered aircraft could lead to a
proliferation of newly (certified) foreign repair stations and an
expansion of many existing foreign facilities,'' said James M.
Guyette, United vice president for operations.
   The FAA says it has received 81 applications for foreign repair
station certification, 78 of them in Europe and three in the
Pacific. One Pacific application has been approved, and 12 European
and two other Pacific stations are being considered for
certification, the FAA said.
   It said planned increases in foreign-based inspection personnel
will allow full surveillance of the additional facilities if they
are certified.
   John J. Kerrigan of the Transport Workers Union called the rule
``the single most important threat to the future of aviation
maintenance in this country.''
   The union, which represents 18,000 mechanics, joined American
Airlines in opposing the 1988 rule change.

<HEAD>Burma's Soaring Rice Price Provokes Fears of Unrest</HEAD>

   The price of rice is rising beyond the
means of many in Burma and shortages could provoke renewed calls for
democratic reform in the country, diplomats say.
   The military government, however, has assured the people that
supplies of the staple are plentiful.
   Last year rising prices of food _ particularly rice _ helped draw
mass support in Burma for months of protests demanding an end to
more than a quarter century of one-party rule and authoritarian
repression.
   The government's inability to stem price increases this year
could once again stir open defiance of the government despite
September's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in which
thousands died, diplomats say.
   More than 10,000 people attended a pro-democracy rally Wednesday
in the Burmese capital of Rangoon in defiance of martial law, which
prohibits gatherings of more than five people.
   It was the largest protest since last year's protests.
   ``It is a constant theme for the government now to talk about
lowering (rice) prices, but they continue to rise,'' a Western
diplomat said from Rangoon Wednesday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``If people cannot afford the price of rice they are going to get
unhappy and start looking for someone to blame again.''
   The price of rice in Rangoon has doubled in the past year, the
diplomat said. A 110-pound bag that cost the equivalent of $44 a
year ago now fetches at least $88, he said. Prices are even higher
elsewhere in the country, he said.
   Despite huge raises for government employees, many people are
experiencing difficulty purchasing essentials such as rice.
   Buying rice is a constant theme of conversation in Burma, the
diplomat said.
   ``People used to greet each other by asking `what have you
eaten?', well now they say `what did you eat with?''' said one
Rangoon housewife. ``If you say you ate with your hands it means
that you had rice, if you say you used a spoon it means you had to
make do with rice soup.''
   And if wage increases have done little to alleviate the problems,
diplomats warn they may spur inflation.
   In a broadcast on state-run radio Sunday, the government blamed
the sudden rise in rice prices on hoarding of stocks by the wealthy
following reports of shortages. They also blamed the increases on
transportation difficulties during the monsoon season.
   ``No one is really sure how much rice there is in the country,
that is why people are hoarding _ they don't know if there is going
to be enough to get them through the monsoon season,'' one diplomat
said.
   With dissatisfaction growing, opposition groups are planning to
rally on anniversary dates of last year's bloody unrest, the
diplomats say.
   ``Right now the attitude is that if the government can't provide
rice, then it can't provide anything, so what good is it?'' one
said.``Rice is really the bottom line in Burma, its even more
important than press freedom or anything else like that.''

   College-educated women who postponed having
children until their 30s are getting earlier pre-natal care and
having fewer underweight babies than other mothers, according to a
government report.
   Four times more women aged 30 to 34 had first babies in 1986 than
did women in the same age group in 1970, the National Center for
Health Statistics reported Wednesday.
   Between 1970 and 1986, the number of first births to women 30 to
34 increased from 42,404 to 181,504, the center reported. For women
35 to 39, the total first births rose from 11,704 to 44,427.
   The increase in older first-time mothers reflects women who have
postponed families while completing educations and launching
careers, sociologists have reported.
   Among women 30 to 34, the proportion of first-time mothers who
have college degrees increased from 40 percent in 1975 to 48 percent
in 1986, according to the report compiled by Stephanie J. Ventura.
   Although some increase can be attributed to the overall rise in
education among women, the rate also reflects that some women are
postponing having children, the report said.
   ``It is apparent that well-educated women ... have postponed
childbearing, and that they are making up for at least some of the
delay at a growing pace,'' Ventura said.
   Better-educated mothers are seeking earlier medical attention for
themselves and their babies, resulting in fewer underweight births,
according to the study, ``Trends and Variations in First Births to
Older Women, 1970-86.''
   Birth weight is widely used as a measure of infant health, with
babies weighing less than 5 pounds 8 ounces considered at risk.
   For women 30 to 34, the report found, 7.5 percent of all first
births suffered from low birth weight. But among women with college
educations the share was 5.8 percent.
   ``Greater educational attainment ... is associated with more
timely receipt of pre-natal care and a better outcome in terms of
birth weight,'' Ventura said.
   As of 1986, for example, about 91 percent of first-time mothers
30 to 34 began pre-natal care during the first trimester of their
pregnancy, the report showed.
   By comparison, 77.4 percent of all first-time mothers started
care that early, and among women 15-19 pre-natal care was begun in
the first three months by only 55.8 percent of first-time mothers.
   The report did not go into other health factors concerning the
age at which women first gave birth.
   The study comes just two weeks after a Census Bureau report
showed that one-third of all the children born in 1988 had mothers
30 and over.
   While women in their 30s were having more children, the birth
rate for younger women has been declining while those women pursue
educations and careers.
   When asked in surveys about expectations of future births, large
numbers of these women continued to report plans for families.
   ``The question that remains is to what extent those women who
intend to have children will actually have the children they expect
to bear,'' Ventura wrote.

   Abortion rights activists expect to blunt the
impact of a Supreme Court ruling with a ``mass mobilization of the
American people'' to march on the Capitol and to target key
legislative races next year.
   Organizers for the National Organization for Women announced
Wednesday they hope to draw 1 million people to the march at the end
of October.
   The march ``will make the equal rights march look like a peanut
compared to the giant that will come out here,'' NOW President Molly
Yard told a rain-dampened crowd of several hundred who gathered for
a rally across the street from the White House.
   ``We will organize with NOW the largest mass mobilization in
history,'' she said.
   Last April, abortion rights activists lobbied on Capitol Hill to
try to influence the Supreme Court's decision on a Missouri law
imposing restrictions on abortion. Crowd-size estimates ranged from
300,000 to 600,000 men and women, Democrats and Republicans and
Hollywood stars.
   However, justices on Monday upheld the Missouri law, giving
states new power to regulate abortion.
   ``We're not about to go home and give up,'' said Yard. ``We are
going to stay and fight.''
   Yard said the NOW march will be part of the group's ``Freedom
Campaign for Women's Life,'' which also will include a ``Freedom
Caravan'' that will travel to every state to educate women about the
abortion rights movement.
   About 14 leaders from a dozen national pro-choice groups yelled
into microphones set up in Lafayette Park to issue warnings to
President Bush and other elected officials who are against women
having the right to choose abortions. Others held banners, waved
signs, hooted, cheered and clapped.
   Police lined the streets and milled through the crowd to carry
off a few anti-abortion activists who infiltrated the rally with
their own signs.
   Irene Natividad, national chairwoman of the National Women's
Political Caucus, said her group will focus on training women to run
for state legislative seats. She said delegates to the group's
August convention will receive copies of a manual, ``How to Run and
Win on Choice.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said she will introduce
legislation to move the family planning issue ``front and center.''
   ``I think this is a political struggle from beginning to end. We
say to state legislators and federal congressmen all across this
country, `Take our rights and we'll take your jobs,''' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League.
   ``We will be single-issue voters,'' she said. ``Choice is the
most important issue that we can vote on. We are busily engaged in
targeting key races. We are going to be the most bold and
sophisticated and hard-hitting political campaign this nation has
ever seen.''

   U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab
signed an agreement with Britain today to simplify procedures for
exchanging information on drug trafficking, commercial fraud and
other customs matters.
   A Customs spokesman said the Mutual Assistance Agreement ``for
the first time, provides a legal basis for intergovernmental
cooperation'' that has been going on informally for years.
   The new agreement was signed by von Raab and J.B. Unwin, chairman
of Britain's Board of Customs and Excise.
   Customs spokesman Dennis Shimkowski said similar agreements are
being negotiated between the United States and other countries that
are frequent trade partners.
   Narcotics smuggling is a prime target of the agreement, which
will allow the quick exchange of drug trafficking intelligence
between the two governments. There also is a provision that calls
for cooperation in the surveillance of suspected persons or goods.
   Other provisions provide for investigative and inspection
assistance when requested and the mutual use of witnesses and
documents in civil or criminal proceedings. Both nations are allowed
to withhold assistance for reasons of national interest.
   Shimkoski said Britain and the United States have been
cooperating informally for years, but there were delays in sharing
intelligence because the information was sent through diplomatic
channels.
   ``It took forever to get things done,'' said Shimkowski.
   The United States already has similar customs agreements with 10
countries. They are West Germany, Austria, Mexico, Canada, Italy,
South Korea, Cyprus, Sweden, Finland and Norway.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Asks For No Strings on Thrift Enforcement Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says
indictments and convictions obtained by a special Dallas task force
show what can be done nationwide if Congress gives him $50 million
to root out savings and loan embezzlers.
   But he's saying ``no thanks'' to a House offer of $75 million if
the Texas task force is kept in operation and a similar unit is
established in Southern California.
   The two areas have the biggest backlog of S&amp;L fraud cases. They
also account for about two-thirds of the thrift losses behind a $157
billion bailout of the nation's biggest financial disaster since the
1930s depression.
   ``What we prefer to do is have the flexibility to move our
resources where they are necessary,'' Thornburgh said Wednesday. He
said his department will oppose the mandated task forces when
lawmakers start reconciling differences between House and Senate
versions of the bill next week.
   Meanwhile, Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall
said Wednesday that net withdrawals from the nation's 2,934 S&amp;Ls
eased for the fourth month in a row in May.
   Wall told reporters there was only a ``slight outflow'' of
deposits in May, compared with $5.4 billion taken out in April.
   Including interest credited to depositors' accounts, deposits
actually rose in May, the first time that has occurred since last
December, Wall said. But, excluding interest, depositors took out
more money than they put in.
   Thornburgh called a press conference Wednesday to announce the
conviction of three former Dallas S&amp;L executives on fraud and other
insider abuse charges and the indictment of a fourth person.
   He attributed the convictions _ all on guilty pleas _ and
indictment to the special Dallas task force and said it is evidence
of what can be done if Congress provides ``the tools needed to do
the job.''
   Since its creation two years ago, the task force _ a joint
operation of the Justice Department's criminal division, the U.S.
attorney's office in Dallas, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service
and the bank board _ has obtained 50 indictments and 32 convictions,
Thornburgh said.
   But he said he opposes a provision in the House S&amp;L bailout bill
that would mandate the task forces for three years. Instead,
Thornburgh endorsed a Senate version that parallels exactly
President Bush's proposal to devote $50 million over the next three
years for prosecuting S&amp;L fraud but with no strings on how the money
is spent.
   The three former S&amp;L executives listed Wednesday by Thornburgh as
entering guilty pleas are:
   _John H. Roberts Jr., former president of Summit Savings
Association of Dallas, who was accused of using a nominee borrower
to obtain a $4.5 million loan from the institution in order to
provide an airplane for Roberts' personal use. He faces a maximum
prison term of 10 years and a $15,000 fine.
   _Joseph R. Smith, former vice president at Sunbelt Savings
Association in Dallas, who was accused of conspiring to defraud the
bank board and the IRS. He faces a maximum sentence of five years
and a fine of up to $250,000.
   _Kenneth C. Hood, former vice president of Western Savings
Association in Dallas, who was accused of attempting to defraud the
IRS by creating artificial ``losses'' and by making a false
statement in connection with a $11.3 million loan from Sunbelt. He
faces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of
$500,000.
   Indicted was Bob R. Franks, former president of Northpark Savings
Association in Richardson, Texas. Franks is accused of illegally
diverting $138,000 in Northpark funds to make an interest payment on
a $2.95 million loan from Centennial Savings Association of
Greenville, Texas. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 15
years in prison and fined up to $500,000.

   People who shop by phone or mail order are
finding less to complain about, according to the Council of Better
Business Bureaus.
   Store shoppers, on the other hand, were a little less satisfied
in 1988 than they were the previous year, the council said in a
report Wednesday.
   According to a compilation of figures supplied by the nation's
180 Better Business Bureaus, ``ordered product sales'' prompted
58,200 complaints, compared to 68,500 in 1987, dropping from first
to third in the ranking of complaints against sellers.
   Ordered products consist of items, including subscriptions,
ordered by mail or telephone.
   ``I don't know of a specific action or a specific program, but
what I would suggest is there has been a renewed emphasis on
customer service,'' said Connie Heatley, a public relations
executive with the New York-based Direct Marketing Association in
New York.
   Retail stores prompted 65,900 complaints in 1988, moving to No.
1, compared with 65,200, or second place, the year before.
   Home furnishings accounted for the highest complaints, 12,500, in
the retail category.
   Service firms were the second-highest source of complaints, at
58,600, compared with 59,350 in 1987, when they ranked third. Auto
service firms are excluded from that category.
   Home improvement and remodeling companies ranked fourth,
receiving 46,000 complaints, compared with 45,750 the previous year.
Auto, truck and recreational vehicle dealers were at the bottom of
the list both years, with 31,000 complaints in 1988 and 26,750 in
1987.
   In a separate category, the council said customer requests for
assistance in resolving problems numbered 3.4 million, 50 percent
higher than in 1987.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's slow journey toward
conservatism over the past two decades became a quick-paced march in
its 1988-89 term, with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist leading
and Ronald Reagan's three appointees right with him.
   The Rehnquist court came of age as it cut back abortion rights,
curtailed affirmative action for women and minorities, limited other
civil rights protections, condoned mandatory drug testing and
permitted capital punishment for juvenile and retarded killers.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy tipped the balance of power. In his
first full term, he solidified a comparatively youthful conservative
majority that prevailed in a series of important 5-4 votes.
   Thus with three appointments, former President Reagan
accomplished what Richard M. Nixon failed to do with four _
fundamentally reshape the nation's highest court, and perhaps the
future of American law as well.
   Reagan named Sandra Day O'Connor to the court in 1981, then
promoted Rehnquist and appointed Antonin Scalia in 1986 after Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger retired. Kennedy joined them early last
year.
   Allied with Rehnquist and Byron R. White, who was appointed by
President John F. Kennedy in 1962, the Reagan appointees are now in
control.
   Conservatives two years ago were panning Rehnquist's first term
as chief justice, dejectedly admitting that he had been
outmaneuvered and overshadowed by William J. Brennan, the court's
leading liberal.
   Rehnquist clearly assumed a leadership role the next year, but
not without joining in some surprising rulings that sparked
commentators to say he had moderated his staunchly conservative
ideology.
   ``Statesmanlike'' is what some conservatives called Rehnquist's
performance in the court's 1987-88 term. But Kennedy's votes in the
just-completed term allowed Rehnquist to be Rehnquist again,
standard-bearer for the causes conservatives hold most dear.
   Two major exceptions to the court's conservative path through
1970s and 1980s _ abortion and civil rights _ are exceptions no more.
   Waiting until the last day of the 1988-89 term to announce a
decision in its mostly closely watched case of the decade, the court
gave states far greater power to regulate abortion.
   The immediate impact: Abortions are likely to become harder to
get.
   The implications: It now appears much more likely the court will
reverse its 1973 decision, in Roe vs. Wade, that women have a
constitutional right to abortion. Reversal, which could come as
early as next year, would allow states to outlaw most abortions.
   A clear majority _ Rehnquist, White, Scalia, Kennedy and O'Connor
_ believe Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided. Only O'Connor's
reluctance to throw out the 1973 ruling stopped the court this time,
but three new abortion disputes will be on the court's docket when
it ends its summer recess in October.
   In other key rulings this term, the court:
   _Made it more difficult for minorities and women to prove
on-the-job bias by using statistics.
   _Gave white men more power to challenge court-approved
affirmative action plans helping minorities and women as unlawful
``reverse discrimination.''
   _Shielded states and state officials from some civil rights
lawsuits.
   _Made it more difficult to sue cities when their employees
violate someone's civil rights.
   _Limited the scope of a key civil rights law, ruling that it does
not apply to racial or sexual harassment in employment.
   _Ruled that states may not be sued under a federal law aimed at
bettering the educational opportunities of handicapped people.
   _Said federal prosecutors may seize the assets of defendants even
if those assets were going to be used to hire a lawyer.
   _Ruled that states are not obligated to provide free lawyers to
death row inmates who lose their initial round of appeals.
   _Ruled that the death penalty may be imposed on convicted
murderers who were as young as 16 when they committed their crime.
   _Ruled that capital punishment also may be imposed for mentally
retarded killers.
   _Ruled that police may vary from the precise wording of the
famous Miranda warnings before questioning suspects, even if the
result arguably is confusing.
   Each of those rulings came on 5-4 votes. In each, Brennan and
Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens
dissented.
   In less polarized voting, the court also:
   _Upheld the use of mandatory blood and urine testing for railroad
workers involved in accidents and for U.S. Customs employees seeking
drug-enforcement jobs.
   _Allowed law enforcement agents to stop, question and even search
airline passengers whose looks or actions in some way fit the
``profile'' characteristics of a drug courier.
   _Ruled that states may use anti-racketeering laws to prosecute
pornographic bookstores, but barred the states from closing down the
bookstores before such cases go to trial.
   The court's liberal wing, although most often in dissent, was not
without its significant victories.
   Most notably, Brennan wrote for a 5-4 majority that included
Kennedy and Scalia when the court ruled that burning the American
flag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest.
   And Brennan was the author when the court ruled, 5-4, that
sentencing juries may not consider a murder victim's personal traits
when deciding whether the killer should receive life in prison or
death. Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy dissented.

   The African National Congress, an outlawed
South African anti-apartheid group, is planning to open an
information office here.
   The Pentagon has listed the ANC as a terrorist organization in
its ``Terrorist Group Profiles,'' although the State Department has
questioned that listing.
   ``We need to establish ourselves strongly in this city,'' Dumi
Matabani, a South African who has been representing the ANC from his
home here the past eight years, said Wednesday.
   Matabani said an office would be opened before the end of the
year, once funding and space for the facility have been organized.
Matabani is registered with the Justice Department as a foreign
agent representing the ANC for lobbying and information purposes.
   The ANC, founded 75 years ago, was outlawed by South Africa in
1960 and its leader, Nelson Mandela, was jailed. The group began a
sabotage campaign one year later, claiming it had no alternative

   The Federal Communications Commission has given
a permanent waiver to Capital Cities@ABC from rules that
could have required the firm to sell multimillion-dollar radio and
television stations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San
Francisco.
   The commission granted Cap Cities@ABC's request that it be
allowed to own WABC-TV, WABC-AM and WPLJ-FM in New York City;
WLS-TV, WLS-AM and WYTZ-FM, Chicago; KABC-TV, KABC-AM and KLOS-FM,
Los Angeles; and KGO-TV and KGO-AM, San Francisco.
   Four months ago, the FCC loosened cross-ownership rules that
prohibited a company from owning both a radio station and a
television station in the same television market.
   The commission said it would look favorably upon waiver requests
involving radio and television station combinations in the largest
25 television markets in the country. In a 3-0 ruling made public
Wednesday, the FCC said Cap Cities@ABC had shown the stations were
located in four of the five largest markets in the country.

   U.S. officials are worried about reports that
Namibia's guerrilla movement tortured prisoners, according to the
State Department.
   Some of the 150 people freed after years of imprisonment said
many others were tortured and beaten to death while held in
underground pits in neighboring Angola.
   They said they were among thousands of dissidents imprisoned by
the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) during its
guerrilla war for independence from South Africa.
   The State Department has been in the forefront of pushing for
independence for the territory. Elections are scheduled in November.
Several freed prisoners estimated SWAPO still holds more than 2,000
detainees.
   Guerrilla leaders say they held just 201 dissidents and have
released them all.

<HEAD>Study: 25 Million Americans Infected With Herpes Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genital herpes infections are far more common in
the United States than experts once thought, but most people who
catch the virus never know they have it, according to a study
published today.
   When herpes emerged as a national scare in the early 1980s,
experts estimated that perhaps 5 million to 10 million Americans had
it. The new data, based on blood samples collected a decade ago,
shows that 25 million people were infected.
   The number infected probably has increased since then. The
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases now estimates
that about 30 million Americans carry the sexually transmitted
virus, and 500,000 more catch it yearly.
   Although being formally published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, the herpes prevalence figures already have been widely
reported and discussed.
   The report was based on an analysis of blood samples drawn from
4,201 people who participated in the second National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey between 1976 and 1980. It was written
principally by Dr. Robert E. Johnson of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control.
   Among the findings:
   _Overall, 16 percent of Americans were infected. The prevalence
increased from less than 1 percent in youngsters under age 15, to 20
percent among those between ages 30 and 44. It then nearly leveled
off.
   _Blacks were far more likely than whites to be infected. Among
those between ages 60 and 74, the infection was found in 20 percent
of whites and 65 percent of blacks. However, the researchers said
the gap between the races may have narrowed since the survey was
conducted.
   _The infection was more common in women than in men among blacks
but not whites.
   _The infection was also more common in those who were divorced,
separated or widowed than in people who stayed married.
   Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. A
related virus, herpes simplex type 1, is more common and causes cold
sores.

<DATELINE>MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious respiratory illness threatens
to kill half the region's desert tortoises, the latest menace for an
animal already under attack by ravens and man's encroachment on the
desert.
   ``The poor things are under a lot of pressure from all
directions,'' said John Borneman, western regional representative
for the National Audubon Society.
   ``Off-road vehicles, habitat loss, dumping in the desert, the
ravens, and now this. At some point it's going to be more than they
can take.''
   Biologists theorize that the tortoises caught the illness from
others taken from the desert by visitors and kept as pets, only to
be returned to the 400-square-mile region with diseases caught while
domesticated.
   John Brode, a state Department of Fish and Game biologist in
Sacramento, said the illness could wipe out 10 percent to 50 percent
of the desert tortoise population.
   ``It's like a cold _ a runny nose,'' he said. ``All we know is
that it seems to be a viral infection and it's very serious. There's
very little chance of recovery. ... They could become extinct.''

<HEAD>Things Aren't Just Ducky for Resident Mallards at Water Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some savvy ducks have found their version of
Florida's vacation paradise at a water amusement park, but the
management wants the little visitors to go back from whence they
waddled.
   ``They just hang out _ use the Lazy River ride, mooch food and
eye all the pretty women,'' said Richie Fontanez, a lifeguard at the
Wet 'n Wild theme park, where the resident mallard population has
reached more than 30.
   ``The big problem is what goes in a duck comes out a duck.''
   On Wednesday, the park started an eviction attempt. The plan was
to relocate them about 15 miles east, to the town of Bithlo.
   But that was easier said than done.
   For eight hours, the ducks waddled and fluttered just out of
range of a small arsenal of nets and baited wire traps set up by
Orange County Animal Control officers and environmentalists.
   But by the end of the day, only one had been nabbed _ by Cindy
Westra, co-founder of Back to Nature, a wildlife rehabilitation and
education center near Chuluota in neighboring Seminole County. She
lured it with bread crumbs and soft words.
   ``They're greedy little beggars. The park has now become a very
convenient meal ticket for them,'' said Carmen Shaw, the center's
other founder. She and Westra volunteered to help capture the
gentle, migratory birds.
   Nobody knows where they came from, but they've been living at the
park's lake about six years. There are about six times as many ducks
now as there were originally.
   Once the duck roundup is over, the birds will be taken by car to
a Bithlo ranch, where they will be introduced to more mundane
aquatic pleasures on a local lake.
   ``They'll be safer on the east side of Orange County,'' said
Shaw. ``That area of the county has less development and is less
polluted.''

<HEAD>Iranians Boycott Annual Pilgrimage to Mecca</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 2 million Moslems from 80
countries are making the annual pilgrimage to Islam's holiest
shrines, both in Saudi Arabia, but Iranians are staying away to
protest new limits on the number of pilgrims. The Iranian media have
intensified their daily broadsides condemning the Saudi royal
family, which oversees the pilgrimage, or hajj, to Mecca and Medina.
   The Saudis last year imposed a quota on the number of pilgrims,
1,000 for every 1 million people in a Moslem country. Iran rejected
the limit, which reduced its usual 150,000 pilgrims by about
two-thirds.
   The Saudis said the reductions would prevent crowding while they
expanded facilities and accomodations in Mecca, birthplace of the
Prophet Mohammed, and Medina, where he is buried.
   But the move was widely seen as aimed at curbing militant Iranian
pilgrims who the Saudis say have violated a ban on political
demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   ``We never intended to bar the Iranians from the hajj,'' Interior
Minister Prince Nayef said in a statement distributed Wednesday by
the official Saudi Press Agency. ``We have told Tehran that Iranian
hajjis are welcome to come to the kingdom, but in a specific number
as is the case with hajjis from other Islamic countries.''
   During the pilgrimages, oil-rich Arabian princes mingle with
paupers from Bangladesh. Other hajjis include Uzbeks from the Soviet
Union, Turks, Nigerians, Indonesians, Poles, Sicilians and Chinese.
   Security has been tight since 1979, when extremists seized the
Grand Mosque in Mecca and held it for two weeks before Saudi forces
stormed it.
   More than 250 people were killed, including 100 of the fanatics.
Another 63 were later beheaded.
   The Saudis arrested scores of Iranian Revolutionary Guards posing
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and
explosives. In 1987, 402 pilgrims _ most Iranians _ were killed in
Mecca in riots the Saudis say the Iranian fundamentalists instigated.
   The Saudis have said that with the Iranians' absence this year,
there has been little need for the extra security.
   ``We've been told that no Iranians are coming and that's a
relief,'' a Pakistani pilgrim, Abdul-Khatir Bakhsh, said in an
interview.
   The Saudis severed relations with Tehran in April 1988, citing
Iranian subversion and terrorism.
   ``If the rulers of Iran are still bent on offending the hajjis,
we reject and will resist this,'' Prince Nayef said. ``We will not
allow anyone to undermine the safey of the hajjis or the homeland.''
   He said that an unspecified number of Iranians living outside
Iran were making the pilgrimage.
   By the time the hajj climaxes July 12, Saudi officials estimate
that more than 2 million Moslems will have made the pilgrimage,
about half of them Saudis.
   Officials said there are 31 pilgrims from the Soviet Union,
compared with 15 last year.
   ``More people will be coming in the future, thanks to glasnost,''
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness, said Mufti
Talgat Tadzhuddin, a Soviet pilgrim.
   China also has been more liberal, allowing 2,000 men and women to
make the pilgrimage, twice the size of last year's group.
   In Mecca, birthplace of Islam, the men discard jewelry, robes and
business suits to don two pieces of white, seamless cloth the size
of bath towels. The attire signifies equality in the eyes of Allah.
   Women wear head-to-toe cloth garments and are not allowed to wear
perfume.
   All Moslems are expected to make the pilgrimage at least once if
they can afford it. During the hajj, they abstain from cutting their
hair, enjoying pleasures of the flesh and even killing mosquitoes.
   The pilgrimage is not just a religious gathering _ which the
Saudis televise and beam by satellite to Moslem countries _ but also
an international bazaar.
   Officials said more than 600,000 Saudis are congregating in Mecca
and Medina to sell items such as food, prayer rugs and souvenirs.
   The Saudi royal family's custodianship of the holy shrines is its
main source of legitimacy with the world's 1 billion Moslems.
   The government spends billions on logistics for the pilgrimage,
whose main destination is Mecca but includes a side trip to Medina.
   The Saudis are spending billions more on modernizing Mecca and
Medina by building high-rise apartments and hotels, and gouging huge
underground parking lots in the rocky hills ringing Mecca.

   Here are excerpts from statements made in U.S.
District Court at Judge Gerhard A. Gesell's sentencing of Oliver L.
North on Wednesday:
   By North:
   Your Honor, I have devoted nearly two decades to the service of
our country and I would never knowingly do anything to hurt it or
any of its institutions. Over these years there have been some
success. But I have always believed that those accomplishments were
more the result of the efforts of the good people I was privileged
to work with rather than myself.
   I also recognize that I have made many mistakes and as a result
of those mistakes I have been convicted of serious crimes. I have
also lost a chance to ever again serve as a Marine.
   In his paperwork the prosecutor said that I feel no remorse. In
that he is wrong. For I grieve over what has happened. And I truly
do pray about it every day. One should not confuse a smile or a wave
toward the ever present press cameras that seem to follow me around
for a lack of sensitivity over what has happened or lack of care for
the consequences.
   That I choose to face each day with faith that this will all
eventually end well, that the anguish of my wife and four children
will some day end should not, I believe, be held against me. I pray
daily that their two and a half year nightmare will some day end in
the not too distant future and that they will be able to think of
something other than what has preoccupied me when they arise in the
morning. ...
   Over the course of these many months I have often wondered when
this seemingly endless ordeal will indeed end. I cannot describe for
you in words that are adequate how much all of this has hurt my
family, how it has disrupted or interfered with our children's young
lives. How their days which should have been filled with the joyful
things of childhood have been so radically altered and different and
sad.
   Nor can I tell you how it has affected my wife of nearly 21 years
to see what she rightly deserves not to see as her children are
attacked, so often uncertain because of what their father did or
failed to do, because of who he was and what he did or didn't do.
Nor can I describe to you the hurt that this has meant to Betsy
herself because there are some things that are felt too deeply to
say in public. ...
   Your Honor, I ask only that you consider these things when you
weigh the sentence, that you be lenient so that they will have a
chance to rebuild their lives.

   By Gesell:
   I can assure you, Colonel North, that I'm going to take into full
consideration the important fact that before you came to the White
House you had served your country with distinction in the highest
traditions of the Marine Corps.
   And the court is not going to overlook that there were major
matters of military and quasi-military nature which you performed,
again with the highest distinction at great personal risk to
yourself after you came to the White House. But I'm sure you realize
that this case has little to do with your military behavior,
commitment or expertise.
   The indictment involves your participation in particular covert
events. I do not think that in this area you were a leader at all,
but really a low-ranking subordinate working to carry out
initiatives of a few cynical superiors. You came to be the point man
in a very complex power play developed by higher-ups.
   Whether it was because of the excitement and the challenge or
because of convictions, you responded certainly willingly and
sometimes even excessively to their requirements. And along the way
you came to accept, it seems to me, the mistaken view that Congress
couldn't be trusted and that the fate of the country was better left
to a small inside group, not elected by the people, who were free to
act as they chose while publicly professing to act differently.
   Thus you became, and by a series of circumstances in fact and I
believe in your mind, part of a scheme that reflected a total
distrust in some constitutional values.
   Now, a trial is a very extraordinary thing. As you stand there
now you're not the fall guy for this tragic breach of the public
trust.
   The jury composed of everyday citizens your supporters mocked and
mocked throughout the trial understood what was taking place.
Observing that many others involved in the events were escaping
without censure or with prosecutorial promises of leniency or
immunities, they used their common sense. And they gave you the
benefit of a reasonable doubt.
   You're here now because of your own conduct when the truth was
coming out. Apparently you could not face disclosure and decided to
protect yourself and others. You destroyed evidence, altered and
removed official documents, created false papers after the events to
keep Congress and others from finding out what was happening.
   Now, I believe that you knew this was morally wrong. It was
against your bringing up. It was against your faith. It was against
all of your training. Under the stress of the moment it was easier
to choose the role of a martyr but that wasn't a heroic, patriotic
act nor was it in the public interest.
   You have had great remorse for your family and understandably so.
It is often the tragic part of what happens when mistakes are made.
I believe you still lack full understanding, however, of how the
public service has been tarnished.
   Nonetheless, what you believe is your own business and jail would
only harden your misconceptions. Given the many highly commendable
aspects of your life your punishment will not include jail.
   Indeed, community service may in the end make you more conscious
of certain values which at times you and your associates appear to
have overlooked in the elite isolation of the White House.
   Your notoriety has cause many difficulties but it has also made
you a rich man. And where you go from here is up to you, as I see
it. You can continue to flame the myth by which you have supported
yourself during these recent difficult years or you can turn around
now and do something useful. ...
   I want to talk to you about the community service. I've spent a
lot of time thinking about it. I want the community to get the
benefit of your organizational and administrative skills which are
very, very high. I believe, as your counsel has indicated, that you
are a caring person. And this community service I'm putting before
you like many aspects of this case is unique.
   There is a model program to be tested in the District of
Columbia, fully financed and in the final formative stages at the
present time. It involves a program of counseling, training and
educating and, where necessary, providing after-care for District of
Columbia inner city youths, most of whom are living in public
housing surrounded by the drug culture.
   The work will involve no fund raising, no public speaking but a
very complex administrative task of coordinating various private and
D.C. resources in a program targeted to see if we can't stop the
scourge of drugs that hits the young people of this city.
   And I'm asking you and directing that you participate in that
program and give it your administrative skills, your organizational
skills and if it succeeds, as I believe and hope it will ... it
gives you an opportunity, I think, a sense of fulfillment and a
chance to start something good and wholesome for the future.

   Here is a chronology of key events in the
Oliver North Iran-Contra case, from his indictment to sentencing:
   1988=
   March 16 _ North, former Reagan National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter, former Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Iranian-American
arms dealer Albert Hakim are indicted on charges including
conspiracy to divert Iranian arms-sales profits to the Contras.
   March 18 _ North announces his retirement from the Marine Corps,
says he may subpoena ``the highest ranking officials in our
government.''
   June 6 _ U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell orders separate
trials for the four defendants; independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh, the next day, says North will go first.
   Nov. 7 _ One of 16 criminal counts against North, fabricating a
document, is dismissed.
   Nov. 21 _ Gesell says that if North stands trial, the court will
have little control over the testimony of witnesses ``acquainted
with high security matters.'' He appeals to President Reagan to
decide whether the government will allow the trial to take place.
   Nov. 29 _ Gesell refuses to dismiss two of the central charges
against North, conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of
government property. He dismisses one, wire fraud.
   Dec. 1 _ Reagan rules out a North pardon but says ``duty
requires'' his administration to block release of secret documents
North wants for his trial.
   Dec. 12 _ Gesell tells North he can't use 3,500 secret documents,
that he can use more than 300, roughly the same number planned to be
introduced by the prosecution. The decision removes a major obstacle
to the trial going forward.
   Dec. 30 _ North subpoenas Reagan and President-elect Bush as
defense witnesses. Gesell, after Bush is sworn as president the
following month, rules he won't be called. He postpones a decision
regarding Reagan.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>1989</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 5 _ Prosecutors ask Gesell to dismiss conspiracy and theft
charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's refusal
to release material the judge ruled North would need. Gesell later
dismisses those counts.
   Twelve felony counts remain, including lying to Congress in 1985
and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Contras and lying to the
attorney general about the National Security Council's role in
diverting money from the Iran arms sales.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero, and conspiring to defraud the government of tax
revenue by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the
Contras.
   Jan. 31 _ Jury selection begins.
   Feb. 8 _ The Justice Department interrupts North's trial, urging
new safeguards to prevent him from making surprise disclosures of
classified information. Gesell denies the request.
   Feb. 9 _ A jury of nine women and three men is selected.
   Feb. 10 _ The Justice Department seeks again to delay North's
trial. A federal appeals court panel denies the request.
   Feb. 12 _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist grants a delay until
the full Supreme Court can consider the Justice Department's
objections to the release of classified material by North's defense.
   Feb. 15 _ The Justice Department issues guidelines designed to
guard against disclosure of certain classified material by North.
   Feb. 16 _ The Supreme Court lifts its stay.
   Feb. 21 _ The trial opens with prosecutor John Keker portraying
North as a liar who ``places himself above the law'' and defense
lawyer Brendan Sullivan calling him a patriotic Marine who obeyed
the orders of his commander-in-chief.
   March 8 _ Fund-raiser Carl Channell testifies that North once
said of his work for the Contras: ``I don't care if I have to go to
jail for this; I don't care if I have to lie to Congress.''
   March 15 _ Former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane
testifies that Reagan approved a secret arrangement under which
Honduras got military aid for supporting the Contras.
   March 21 _ Security consultant Glenn Robinette testifies that
North let Secord pay for a security fence at his home and then tried
to cover up the deal after he left the White House.
   March 23 _ Fawn Hall, North's secretary at the White House,
tearfully testifies that he was a tireless and selfless boss and
their shredding of Iran-Contra documents ``was no big deal.''
   March 28 _ Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III testifies
administration officials were worried about impeachment of Reagan
after they discovered the Iran-Contra link.
   March 31 _ Gesell rejects North's request that he order Reagan to
testify, saying there is no proof the former president authorized
North to commit crimes.
   April 6 _ The defense introduces an admission of facts, agreed to
by the government, stating that George Bush, as vice president, met
with Honduran President Suazo to tell him of expedited aid. The
document says the aid was in return for Honduras' help to the
Contras.
   North takes the stand, saying he was merely a Marine following
White House orders.
   April 7 _ North concedes he lied to the House Intelligence
Committee at an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting at the White House at which he
denied providing assistance to the Contras.
   April 12 _ North testifies he thought he was protecting Reagan
when he altered Iran-Contra memos before investigators from the
Justice Department could get a look at them.
   April 13 _ North leaves the stand; the defense rests.
   April 18 _ Prosecutor Keker, in a hard-hitting summation, says,
``North and McFarlane were following Adolf Hitler's old strategy,
which is the victor will never be asked if he told the truth.''
   April 19 _ In an emotional closing argument, Sullivan says North
became a ``sacrificial lamb'' in the Reagan White House and was
fired to spare the former president political harm.
   Bush tells reporters at the White House that ``my conscience is
clear'' about the Iran-Contra affair.
   April 21 _ The jury begins deliberations.
   May 4 _ North is convicted of falsifying and destroying
documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting in
the obstruction of Congress. He was acquitted of five other counts
of lying to or obstructing Congress, of lying to Meese, of illegally
converting traveler's checks to his own use and of conspiring to
defraud the IRS.
   June 30 _ Gesell denies a mistrial motion filed by the defense on
grounds that juror Tara Leigh King had falsely denied in a
questionnaire that she or her relatives had ever been involved in a
court proceeding or criminal investigation.
   July 5 _ Gesell sentences North to a suspended prison term and a
$150,000 fine for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. North is
placed on two years' probation and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service administering a new program to help inner-city
youth avoid involvement in drugs.

<HEAD>Fla. Governor Calls For Special Session on Abortion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Abortion-Elections, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez said he wants a special session of the
Legislature to adopt new abortion restrictions, but Gov. Mario Cuomo
said he would defend New York's liberal abortion laws despite this
week's Supreme Court ruling.
   ``I don't believe we ought to wait until 1990 to deal with a
difficult subject,'' Martinez said Wednesday. ``It's not something
that's going to go away. It's something that must be dealt with.''
   In Baton Rouge, the Louisiana Legislature went into special
session Wednesday but Gov. Buddy Roemer said there wasn't enough
time to add abortion to the agenda.
   Louisiana already blocks the use of state money and facilities
for abortions, and lawmakers have passed a bill that would make
abortion a crime if the U.S. Supreme Court overrules Roe vs. Wade,
the 1973 case that legalized abortion.
   Martinez, a Republican and abortion opponent, endorsed the
Supreme Court ruling that upheld a Missouri law restricting
abortions and invited other states to follow suit. He also said he
was pleased with the ruling because it appeared to reinforce states'
rights.
   ``I think here in Florida we will try and develop a policy for
the state of Florida and not interpret what other states may do with
the ruling the U.S. Supreme Court issued,'' Martinez said. ``Clearly
I believe the unborn ought to have more rights than they have right
now.''
   Martinez said the special session would come no later than a
previously scheduled one in October that was called to consider
growth management and transportation.
   Currently, Florida allows abortions during the first six months
of pregnancy, and in the final three months only to protect the
mother's life. State Medicaid money will pay for abortions only when
the mother's life is threatened.
   The state's parental consent law, which is not enforced because
of a pending lawsuit, is one of the strictest in the country, said
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. It requires unmarried minors to receive the
permission of their parents, a guardian or a judge to have an
abortion.
   ``It also pleased me that we have a parental-consent law pending
before the Florida Supreme Court, and certainly the opinion of the
United States Supreme Court ... goes straight to the heart of the
parental-consent law requirements,'' said Martinez, who met with
pro-life activists Wednesday to discuss plans for a special session.
   New York also allows abortions during the first 24 weeks of
pregnancy and after that if a woman's life is in danger.
   Although Cuomo says he personally opposes abortion, he has
budgeted Medicaid funds for abortion each year. He said he would do
so again in next year's budget despite the ``inevitable attempt by
some legislators to deny fairness to poor people because the Supreme
Court follows a lower standard.''
   ``We think we have a better way and a fairer way,'' the
Democratic governor said. ``Yes, we have been different. I'm proud
of those differences. From a New Yorker's point of view, we do it
better.''
   Cuomo, a Roman Catholic, also said he would oppose any attempt to
forbid abortions from being performed in public hospitals. But he
would not say what he would do if presented with a bill requiring
minors to get parental consent for abortions.

   A pharmacist set fire to 15,000 cigarettes
and challenged others to kick the habit.
   ``Today ... we made a promise we would quit selling cigarettes,
and today has come,'' Kenneth Henderson said Wednesday.
   Bystanders cheered as the United Drug Center owner tossed a match
in a trash can that had a painted message challenging others to quit
smoking.
   Henderson had vowed to quit selling cigarettes on NonDependence
Day, a day set aside by the American Lung Association to encourage
smokers to quit.
   He estimated the cigarettes were worth $1,000.

said. ``I don't think it will be something we can't live with.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading opposition party today
charged the government with political harassment after intelligence
agents and police tried to forcibly detain one of its lawmakers.
   The Agency for National Security Planning tried to detain Lee
Chul-yong of the opposition Party for Peace and Democracy for
questioning on grounds he had knowledge of a fellow lawmaker's trip
to North Korea.
   Under South Korean law, failure to report another's illegal visit
to the communist North is a crime. Lee said he knew nothing about
the trip by National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won until he read about
it in newspapers.
   Three agents approached Lee when he arrived in Pusan, southeast
of Seoul, on business late Wednesday.
   News reports said the agents tried to apprehend Lee in the
airport VIP lounge, saying they had orders to ``courteously escort''
him back to Seoul.
   Lee refused and a scuffle occurred before Lee left hurriedly with
an aide, news reports said. The agents followed Lee into downtown
Pusan and tried unsuccessfully again to take him into custody, the
reports said.
   When Lee returned to Seoul, the agents were on the same plane and
additional agents and about 30 police were at the airport, news
reports said.
   Agents boarded the plane and requested Lee disembark, which he
again refused, the reports said.
   Opposition party members met Lee and whisked him from the airport
to the home of Kim Dae-jung, leader of the party.
   The party said members would not cooperate with questioning
without a court order. It charged the government with ``a
sophisticated political scheme to degrade'' its image.
   The intelligence agency is looking into the illegal trip to North
Korea by Peace and Democracy lawmaker Suh Kyung-won, who is in jail
charged with violating national security law.
   The party announced today it would protest what it called
``harassment and political suppression'' with Park Seh-jik, director
of the Agency for National Security Planning, accusing the
intelligence agency of exceeding its authority.
   Pang Chae-myung, a business partner of Suh, was arrested
Wednesday night for failing to report Suh's visit to authorities. He
was the ninth person to be charged in the case.
   The Seoul government maintains that contact with North Korea must
be made only through official channels and that the north remains
intent on spreading communism throughout the divided peninsula.
   The Korean peninsula was split into the communist north and the
capitalist South in 1945 at the end of World War II and the two
nations remain bitter enemies.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA7 of July 5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and
Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward
Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, a
planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on June 22 when it was
57.2 million miles from Neptune. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released Wednesday by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which called it ``the
best color photo of Neptune taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its Aug. 24 close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from Earth, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of Neptune. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot or Earth's
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on Jupiter, Saturn and apparently on Neptune are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe Earth's jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said Hansen and Caltech planetary
scientist Andrew Ingersoll.
   Jupiter's 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on Neptune,
Stone said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on Saturn, he added.
   Stone said that on Jupiter, and possibly Neptune, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. Jupiter's
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from Neptune to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
Neptune's atmosphere, said Rich Terrile, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying Neptune's atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' Terrile said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., in 1977.
   They explored Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 1 flew past Saturn in 1980
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986 and will fly about 3,000 miles above
Neptune's north pole cloudtops at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   Five hours later it will encounter Neptune's backward-orbiting
moon, Triton, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
Pluto's elongated orbit Neptune will be the ninth and outermost
until 2007.

   Taiwan registered a trade surplus of $6.2
billion in the first six months of this year, a 36.1 percent
increase over the same period last year, the government announced
today.
   Exports in the first half of 1989 totaled $32.1 billion, a 9.9
percent increase from the year-ago period and imports were $25.9
billion, a 5.1 percent rise, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics said.
   Analysts said the first-half surplus was due mainly to
record-high exports in May, which totaled $6.3 billion.
   They said labor and political unrest in South Korea helped boost
Taiwan exports as foreign buyers switched their orders to the island.
   Taiwan's surplus with the United States, its largest trading
partner, totaled $5.5 billion in the period, compared to $4 billion
a year ago.
   Trade with Japan, Taiwan's second-largest trading partner,
registered a deficit of $3.2 billion for the year's first six
months, up from $2.7 billion last year.
   Trade officials expect this year's total trade surplus to be
about $9 billion, compared to $10.9 billion last year.

<HEAD>Deadly Bacteria Returns After 50 Years, Doctors Say</HEAD>

   An outbreak of rapidly fatal bacterial infections
in at least four western states could mark the return of dangerous
strains of strep germs that mysteriously disappeared almost 50 years
ago, researchers reported today.
   The newly recognized illness, which doctors call streptococcal
toxic shock syndrome, can lead from a minor skin infection to death
in a day or two.
   Strep germs are common but usually result in relatively minor
illnesses, such as sore throats. More virulent forms of the microbes
were once frequent causes of life-threatening illnesses, including
scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. But for reasons unclear, the
dangerous strains of strep largely faded away in the early 1940s.
   In today's New England Journal of Medicine, doctors describe 20
cases of severe illness, including six deaths, that were seen
between 1986 and 1988 in Idaho, Montana, Utah and Nevada. They
believe the illness was caused by strep bacteria that produce
scarlatina toxin, the poison responsible for scarlet fever.
   Although experts are unsure of the outbreak's scope, Dr. Dennis
L. Stevens said, ``It's a bigger problem than 20 patients, believe
me.''
   Stevens, the report's chief author, said he expects to hear of
many more cases after today's publication.
   However, Dr. Robert Breiman of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta cautioned that there may always have been
occasional severe strep attacks that have gone unnoticed.
   ``Whether these 20 cases are a major change from the past, it's
hard to know,'' Breiman said.
   Stevens saw his first case in 1984 at the Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Boise, Idaho. The victim had gone to the hospital
with a mild fever. After 10 hours, he went into shock. Eight hours
later, he died.
   ``I was amazed at the rapidity with which this occurred,'' he
said. ``I saw another case a year later. I started talking to
colleagues. They told me of similar cases.''
   Since Stevens and his colleagues, a group of infectious disease
specialists who meet once a year as the Rocky Mountain Pus Club,
assembled the 20 cases he has since seen more, including some in
California and Washington state.
   About two years ago, other doctors began reporting an increase in
the number of cases of rheumatic fever. In addition, outbreaks of
severe strep disease have been reported recently in Britain and
Scandinavia.
   Dr. Edward Kaplan of the University of Minnesota, a co-author of
the latest study, said he believes there may be some connection
between the emergence of these dangerous strep illnesses, perhaps a
genetic change in the strep bacteria.
   ``With all due respect to some people who are skeptical, one
can't help being impressed with what has happened,'' he said. ``This
could be either because we are looking harder or it's a real event.
I think it's a real event.''
   Of the 20 cases described, six victims, or 30 percent, died of
the illness. Five died within four days of admission to a hospital.
Three of them died within 36 hours. Most started with red, tender
skin and quickly went on to more serious symptoms, including shock,
kidney failure and breathing failure.
   Most were healthy young adults. Their median age was 36 and all
but four were younger than 50.
   ``People born before 1940 (when scarlet fever was more common)
probably have had contact with this toxin and probably have
antibodies that protect them from developing this shocklike
episode,'' said Stevens. ``We think the reason it's attacking young
people and not old people is predominantly because they are
immunologic virgins to this toxin.''
   The variety of toxic shock syndrome associated with tampon use in
menstruating women is caused by a different microbe, the
staphylococcal bacteria.

<HEAD>Trial of Former Bakker Aides Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors of two former top PTL aides
urged a jury to focus on alleged tax evasion by the pair and not to
be distracted by big salaries or television celebrities at the
ministry.
   ``This case is not about Jim Bakker, Tammy Bakker or Richard
Dortch,'' Justice Department prosecutor Joseph Bender said,
referring to PTL's founder, his wife and former top aide.
   ``It's not about whether the defendants collected exorbitant
salaries or bonuses. It's about the income the defendants failed to
pay taxes on.''
   But the attorney for brothers David and James Taggart said the
opposite in his opening remarks Wednesday.
   ``This case is not about taxes _ we concede at the outset there
are some taxes owed by David and James,'' lawyer Ben Cotten said.
``This is a case about authorization, intent and doubt.''
   The Taggarts were indicted by a federal grand jury in December on
charges of failing to pay $487,000 in income taxes from 1984 to
1987. The indictment was issued the same day that Bakker and Dortch
were indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud.
   Bakker's and Dortch's trial on charges of diverting more than $4
million of PTL money to their own use and conspiring to defraud PTL
contributors is scheduled to open Aug. 28 in Charlotte.
   In a four-hour hearing Wednesday, attorneys for Bakker and Dortch
argued that the case should be moved out of western North Carolina
because of pretrial publicity. Dortch's attorney also asked that his
client be tried separately. U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor did not say
when he would rule on the requests.
   In the Taggart case prosecutors said David Taggart, 32, who was
Bakker's personal aide, and Taggart's 35-year-old brother, PTL's
former interior decorator, used ministry credit cards to get large
cash advances and used blank PTL checks to pay American Express
bills.
   Bender said the government would prove the Taggarts illegally
used more than $1.1 million in PTL money to buy such things as a New
York condominium, luxury autombiles, jewelry, furs and designer
clothing.
   The first prosecution witness, special Internal Revenue Service
agent Deborah Burney, said the Taggarts received nearly $1.7 million
in PTL funds from 1984 to 1987 on top of their salaries.
   ``We found there was an understatement'' of their taxable income
on their tax filings during that period, she said.
   Cotten said witnesses and documents would show his clients had
authorization to use the credit cards and take out cash advances
from the highest levels at PTL.
   He described his clients as hard-working, dedicated employees who
were given vast responsibilities in running the multimillion-dollar
ministry in the early 1980s.
   ``During this time frame, several people were getting vast
amounts of benefits through procedures in place that were not under
the control of David and James Taggart,'' Cotten said.
   The witness list in the Taggart trial looks like a ``Who's Who''
of TV evangelism.
   Prosecutors are expected to call up to 69 witnesses, including
evangelists Jerry Falwell, John Wesley Fletcher, Rex Humbard and Rex
Humbard Jr.
   Cotten's witnesses could include Bakker's daughter, Tammy Sue
Chapman, and a former PTL board member, the Rev. Aimee Cortese.
   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years in
prison and face fines of more than $1 million.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Sharply Against Yen, Tokyo Stocks Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar ended sharply lower against the
Japanese yen today while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rose moderately.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 113.77
points, or 0.34 percent, ending the day at 33,423.48.
   The dollar finished trading at 138.90 yen, down 1.30 yen from
Wednesday's close of 140.20 yen. It opened at 138.30 yen and inched
up while fluctuating between 137.85 yen and 139.10 yen.
   Traders said the dollar fell following its decline on overseas
markets overnight, mainly due to expectations that U.S. interest
rates would fall as a result of a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
   Market players were inclined to get rid of the dollar on
expectations of a further shift toward easy credit by the U.S.
Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, said a trader with the
Bank of Tokyo. The committee met Wednesday and will meet again today.
   Dollar-selling sped up following remarks of a high-ranking U.S.
Treasury Department official that the U.S. government was still
concerned about the dollar's high level against the yen, he said.
   On the stock exchange, the index's early rise following buying by
investment trust companies caused optimism in the market, said Kenji
Ishizuka, dealer with Daiwa Securities.
   ``The yen's strength against the dollar largely encouraged
investors' buying incentives,'' he said.
   ``In addition, a majority of market players are expecting the
United States will take action to ease its monetary policy,'' he
said. Expectations of lower interest rates are a stock buying
incentive.
   But many participants remained on the sidelines ahead of Friday's
release of the U.S. jobless rate for June, by which they believe the
U.S. monetary authority will determine its stand, Ishizuka said.

<HEAD>EPA Approves Genetically Altered Virus Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have approved the nation's
first open-air field test of a genetically engineered virus for use
as a pesticide.
   Researchers hope the step will help them develop biological means
of destroying crop-damaging insects.
   Researchers at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research
will test the virus on cabbage plants at Cornell University's New
York State Agricultural Expriment Station in Geneva beginning later
this month, said H. Alan Wood, the virologist who will direct the
test.
   The test is designed to see if a genetically disabled virus will
disappear from the environment quickly after working on insects,
rather than lingering in the field.
   ``The ultimate goal of our project is to come up with
environmentally safe viral pesticides for biological control of
insect pests,'' Wood said Tuesday.
   The test would be the first time a genetically altered virus was
released as an insecticide in the United States, said Fred Betz, a
biologist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Several
genetically altered batcteria have been tested as has a genetically
altered virus that was tested by inoculating animals.
   Scientists are aiming their test at the cabbage looper, a pale
green caterpillar that attacks more than a dozen kinds of vegetables
including cabbage, beets, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower,
collards and kale.
   The virus they are using is identical to naturally occurring
strains known as baculoviruses, which cause viral epidemics in many
agricultural and forest insect pests.
   Researchers will remove a gene that provides a protective protein
coat from the virus. The disabled virus cannot survive long in the
environment, so scientists will mix it with a naturally occurring,
wild strain of the virus before spraying it.
   Scientists hope the method will allow the virus to live long
enough to work on insects without having it linger in the
environment. If the test is successful, researchers hope to combine
the method of disabling the virus with genetic enhancements that
would make the virus more deadly.
   Despite their innate ability to kill insect pests, many
baculoviruses need to be genetically improved to be commercially
viable, said Cornell entomologist Anthony M. Shelton, who is
collaborating on the test.
   The field test will be conducted on a two-acre doughnut-shaped
plot containing 20,000 cabbage plants, of which 2,500 plants in the
center will be sprayed with the virus.
   Wood said the surrounding plants will act as a buffer to prevent
the spread of the virus, and as a control group.
   Shelton and Wood said even if the disabled virus does spread,
there would be no danger to humans and animals because baculoviruses
infect only invertebrates such as insects.
   The EPA approved the field test after determining it posed no
environmental or human health hazards.
   The test plot will be monitored through 1991.

<HEAD>Says Hanoi-backed Regime in Cambodia Is Entitled to Central Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, adjusting U.S. policy to changing realities, said today
that the Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia is entitled to a
central role in efforts to reach a political settlement there.
   Baker endorsed efforts by resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and government leader Hun Sen to reach agreement on
Cambodia's political future once Vietnam completes its promised
troop pullout in September.
   He called this effort ``crucial to the achievement of a viable
political accord.''
   Baker's speech before foreign ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations marked a subtle shift in the evolving U.S.
policy toward Cambodia as Vietnam prepares to complete its
withdrawal.
   For years, the United States focused on a complete Vietnamese
pullout, deriding Hun Sen and his allies as Hanoi's ``puppets.''
   With withdrawal now close, the Bush administration is
increasingly concerned that the Khmer Rouge, militarily the
strongest of three Cambodian resistance factions, could fill the
vacuum left by the departing Vietnamese.
   For Baker, there is no higher priority in Southeast Asia than
blocking the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, which during its
1975-78 rule killed hundreds of thousands as it tried to turn
Cambodia into an agrarian commune.
   The Vietnamese invaded in late 1978, forcing out the Khmer Rouge.
   Baker spelled out the type of agreement he believes would be
appropriate for Cambodia: a cease-fire, cessation of foreign
military aid to all factions, an interim coalition government led by
Sihanouk and an international presence to oversee free elections.
   France has indicated an interest in playing host to a conference
of the four factions that will vie for power in the aftermath of the
Vietnamese withdrawal.
   With U.S. support, the ASEAN countries of Indonesia, Thailand,
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei have been supporting
the two non-communist resistance forces in Cambodia.
   While Baker believes a return to power of the Khmer Rouge could
lead to a second holocaust in Cambodia, Sihanouk's position is that
moderate elements of the Khmer Rouge should be welcome to take part
in a provisional government.
   Sihanouk, a former Cambodian head of state, fears the Khmer Rouge
would otherwise be encouraged to continue the struggle they have
waged since Vietnamese forces ousted them from power.
   On Wednesday, Sihanouk ruled out a separate peace agreement with
the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh and promised to
keep fighting.
   He told a news conference in Beijing, one of his homes in exile,
that any settlement must include his Khmer Rouge allies.
   Fears of a Khmer Rouge takeover have prompted the first serious
division within the United States over Indochina _ Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia _ since U.S. military involvement there ended 16 years ago.
   The Bush administration wants to send lethal aid for the first
time to the non-communist rebel forces in Cambodia. But the
administration is encountering strong resistance in Congress, where
some lawmakers worry that U.S. weapons will fall into the hands of
the Khmer Rouge.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., has said the alternative to such aid
might be a second ``Asian Auschwitz'' under Khmer Rouge sponsorship.
   Baker expressed hope that the day is near when ``Indochina can be
transformed from a battlefield to a marketplace.
   ``Yet to achieve this end _ to remake the terrible swords of the
killing fields into plowshares for a peaceful community _ we must
maintain our resolve and our unity of purpose now more than ever.''

   An exasperated judge fined the United Mine
Workers an additional $720,000 for using convoys to slow coal
shipments, but he doubted the penalties would work.
   ``It's all just sort of whistling Dixie,'' U.S. District Judge
Glen Williams said Wednesday. ``This order is being flouted,
flaunted, openly disobeyed.''
   Williams said he believes the UMW leadership is orchestrating the
tactic against Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   UMW District 28 President Jackie Stump called the fines
excessive. He also said it was difficult to stop people from joining
the convoys.
   ``A lot of them are saying, `We pay taxes on the roads. If we
want, we'll drive on them,''' he said.
   Scattered violence was reported Wednesday, which marked the start
of the fourth month of a strike against Pittston by 1,900 UMW miners
in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. Wildcat strikes also have
been reported in several states since June 12, when thousands of
union miners walked off the job in support of the striking Pittston
miners.
   In McClure, state police said a dynamite explosion damaged a
machinery warehouse owned by Pittston at the base of Hazel Mountain.
No injuries were reported in the blast, and authorities said it was
uncertain whether the explosion was strike related.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said that 20 feet from the
explosion site, company employees found 25 to 30 sticks of dynamite
tightly wrapped with tape. Odom said the wrapped dynamite failed to
detonate, but traffic had to be rerouted for hours while police
explosives experts removed the bundle.
   ``It makes me more firm in my resolution that I'm not going to
yield to terrorists,'' Odom said.
   Union officials could not be reached for comment in the district
office or in the hotel where they have been staying.
   A miner's windshield was smashed as he drove to work at a Peabody
Coal Co. mine near Morganfield, Ky., where UMW members have been on
a wildcat strike this week, authorities said.
   And coal trucks entering a Peabody mine near New Lexington, Ohio,
were stopped at gunpoint for the second time this week, although no
shots were fired either time.
   Odom said a ``rolling blockade'' of hundreds of cars and trucks
continued to clog the main coal hauling road Wednesday. ``They're
out there in full force, ignoring the court order,'' he said.
   Nearly every working day during the past three weeks, the
bumper-to-bumper convoys have tied up traffic on roads connecting
Pittston's processing plants with its supply mines.
   On June 26, Williams declared the union in contempt of court for
orchestrating the tactic two days the previous week and fined the
UMW and two officers $240,000.
   Williams said he will increase the daily fine to $550,000 for
further violations of the convoy ban.
   UMW attorney Mike Passino said the union will appeal the fines,
which now total $960,000.
   U.S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole, meanwhile, met in
Washington with UMW president Richard L. Trumka, who ``did not
request any action from her,'' Dole spokeswoman Johanna Schneider
said. She said the talks would continue and were fruitful.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for jailed Saudi financier and
arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi have asked the Swiss to block a U.S.
request to extradite him so he may stand trial on fraud charges, a
Justice Ministry spokeswoman said.
   Khashoggi is charged in a U.S. indictment with helping ousted
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda conceal
assets allegedly plundered from their homeleand.
   Ministry spokeswoman Ursula Riedel said it would be at least two
weeks before Swiss authorities reach a decision on whether to
extradite Khashoggi, who has been in custody since April 18.
   If authorities approve the extradition request, Khashoggi would
then have 30 days to take his appeal to the Swiss supreme court, the
Federal Tribunal.
   This could mean the former billionaire spending his 54th birthday
on July 25, and possibly many weeks more, in his small jail cell in
the Swiss capital.
   Ms. Riedel and Khashoggi's Swiss lawyer, Ralph Zloczower, both
declined to give details of the appeal against extradition, which
was submitted Tuesday.
   Khashoggi, the Marcoses, five other people and a California bank
were indicted in October by a U.S. District Court in New York.
   The indictment accuses the Marcoses of stealing more than $100
million from the Philippine treasury and using the money to buy real
estate and expensive art objects in New York.
   The U.S. government alleges Khashoggi posed as the owner of some
of the assets to conceal the Marcos' ownership. He is charged with
racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud.
   Racketeering alone carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.

<HEAD>Sailor who Deserted 20 Years Ago Gets Suspended Sentence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TREASURE ISLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnam-era Navy deserter who
secretly led a normal life for 20 years received a suspended
sentence and a bad conduct discharge after friends, politicians and
even veterans urged leniency.
   Charles Smith walked away from his Navy post at Treasure Island
in September 1969, just days after being ordered to report to an
Alaskan outpost. He also left behind a wife and son.
   Smith kept his name, married again and lived less than 10 miles
from the California base during his desertion, which was among the
longest of the Navy's recent cases.
   On Wednesday, the 43-year-old seaman apprentice pleaded guilty to
unauthorized absence from the Navy at a court-martial. He was
tracked down by Navy investigators after his name popped up during a
credit check. Smith had recently purchased a home.
   Judge Capt. Phil Roberts ordered Smith discharged for bad conduct
and added a four-month suspended sentence and the forfeiture of
$1,000 in future Navy pay.
   ``I couldn't ask for anything more,'' said Smith, who had faced a
maximum life sentence for unauthorized absence.
   He also could have been sentenced to one year for desertion and
two years for marijuana use, which was detected during a urinalysis
after his May 3 surrender, said his attorney, Howard DeNike.
   When Smith was asked about his 18 months of active duty during a
news conference following sentencing, he described it as ``a lot of
harassment. We're even now.''
   Smith left the Navy after finding out his first wife was
unfaithful and because he resented the rigidity of military life,
DeNike said. Smith enlisted in March 1968, and left the service
without permission twice for brief periods before his final
desertion.
   Smith has never contacted his former family or his parents and a
sister in Ohio. He also never obtained a divorce from his first
wife, although DeNike said he assumes she either annulled the
marriage or received a divorce.
   Smith remarried in 1975, had five children, bought a house in the
San Francisco suburb San Pablo and became active in the Episcopal
church. He has worked the last 12 years as a foreman at Kardum Paint
Co. of San Francisco, earning $24,000 yearly.
   Prosecutor Lt. Dennis Hoffman portrayed Smith as a ``problem
child'' who never grew up, but Smith's employer and the church
pastor testified he was a dependable worker and family man.
   Friends and his 37-year-old wife, Mary, gathered 600 signatures
from people asking that Smith be given an administrative discharge
and no prison sentence. His wife said she knew nothing of her
husband's desertion.
   U.S. Reps. Ron Dellums and George Miller wrote the Navy urging
leniency. And a veterans' organization with members from every U.S.
war and major conflict since the 1930s asked the military to grant
Smith clemency.
   ``From our personal experiences we can understand how an
individual might simply walk away from the pressures of life in the
Navy, particularly in time of hostilities,'' said Mike Felker,
secretary of the San Francisco-based Veterans Speakers Alliance, in
a letter to the court.
   Following several days in the brig, Smith has reported daily to
Treasure Island for duty on a maintenance unit, earning a salary of
$750 monthly. He is likely to be placed on leave without pay within
a few weeks and then discharged.
   A new enforcement program has reduced the number of desertion
cases from 14,000 in 1987 to 2,485, said Lt. Cmdr. Kaye Roberts,
head of the Navy Deserter Apprehension Program in Washington D.C.
   The record for Navy deserters who turned themselves in belongs to
a now-deceased sailor who jumped ship in 1926 and surrendered to
Navy authorities last year, said Roberts, who would not reveal the
man's identity.
   The longest unresolved desertion case involves a sailor who left
his base in 1962, she added.

   If it were up to folks in Ollie, Oliver North
wouldn't have been placed on two years' probation or fined $150,000
for Iran-Contra crimes.
   ``They shouldn't have given him anything. Hell, he should run for
president. He's the only one who's got any sense,'' Awilda Davis
said Wednesday while nursing a beer at the Old Ollie Inn, which she
used to own.
   ``They pardoned Nixon for what he did. Why can't they pardon
North?''
   A federal judge in Washington on Wednesday sentenced the
45-year-old former White House aide to suspended terms of three, two
and one years for three felony convictions by a jury two months ago.
   In addition to the fine, North also was ordered to devote 1,200
hours to a new program to help District of Columbia youths avoid
involvement with drugs.
   Like Ms. Davis, several other Ollie residents felt the former
Marine lieutenant colonel's sentence was too harsh, even though he
could have been sent to prison for 10 years.
   Ed Horras said North was ``the fall guy'' for the Reagan
administration when the Iran-Contra affair became public more than
two years ago. Horras said he would feel the same way even if the
town didn't share North's first name. The town of 220 residents
invited North to the ``Ollie Big Days'' celebration two years ago,
but he declined the invitation.
   North has contended that in the Iran-Contra affair _ in which
U.S. arms were secretly sold to Iran and profits were diverted to
the Nicaraguan rebels _ he only acted on behalf of Reagan
administration superiors.
   Horras believed him.
   ``I think he's a scapegoat,'' he said. ``If one man was able to
do that, what else is going on that we don't know about?''
   Ollie Mayor Dave Gentry said North was fortunate to receive the
suspended sentence.
   Now that North has been sentenced, Gentry expects fewer visits by
reporters and television news teams.
   ``It will probably be a little drabby now that that's not going
on anymore,'' Gentry said.
   One person who might not mind a return to normalcy is Ollie
Postmaster Bill Northup.
   ``During the Iran-Contra hearings, we got requests every single
day for postmarks for seven solid weeks. I guess we sent out about
4,000 across the country, even to Alaska and Hawaii,'' Northup said.
   ``But things have cooled off. I'll be looking for more (requests)
in the next few weeks because of the sentencing, but by and large I
think things will drop off.''

   Five brothers ended bachelorhood
together in a joint wedding ceremony attended by more than 4,000
people and true to their professed values of thrift and tradition.
   Wednesday's ceremony took place in Penang, 180 miles northwest of
Kuala Lumpur and cost the five Shanmugam brothers about $18,620.
   The brothers, aged 29 to 35 and from an ethnic Indian family,
said felt a joint wedding would both save money and adhere to an
Indian custom of having no more than one wedding per family per year.
   The traditional Indian wedding was conducted by five priests,
headed by the president of the Malaysian Indian Priests Association,
Sai Vamani Muniandy.
   Two people in a family marrying simultaneously is quite common
among the Indian community, but not five at one time.
   The five bridegrooms' three other brothers and two sisters were
already married.

   Oliver North is guilty of nothing more than
following orders, according to his supporters and residents of this
rural upstate village where he grew up.
   ``He was just an intermediary between Reagan and Bush and all the
rest,'' said Charles Havelka, a retired real estate agent whose son
was friends with North.
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Havelka said of the three-year suspended
prison sentence and $150,000 fine North received in federal court in
Washington for his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Havelka said he remembered young Oliver North as a regular
church-goer, a Boy Scout, and later as a Marine. He said he's sure
North did no wrong.
   ``If he's a patriotic American and he said he didn't do anything
wrong, then he didn't,'' Havelka said.
   In suburban Albany, members of the upstate New York chapter of
the American Freedom Coalition rallied and collected signatures on
petitions calling on President Bush to pardon North.
   ``In this particular case the American system of justice has
performed a great travesty,'' said Mitchell Goldstein, head of the
group. ``Oliver North is guilty of nothing more than following
orders and going along with his conscience.
   ``The real villains in this drama are those who hounded Ollie
North and his family for the last 2{ years in pursuit of a political
agenda that the American people reject.''
   Public support has mainly been on North's side in Philmont,
located about 30 miles south of Albany, since congressional hearings
held into the Iran-Contra scandal in the spring of 1987 made North a
hero to many Americans.
   The town of 2,000 residents even held an Oliver North Day in
August 1987 to show their support.
   ``If he came to Philmont tomorrow, I'd give him a hero's
welcome,'' said Phillip Mossman, the village mayor.
   Mossman said North's sentence was too harsh and that the Vietnam
veteran was a ``fall guy.''
   ``Don't tell me that Reagan and Bush didn't know what was going
on,'' Mossman said. ``They come out on national television and call
him a hero and the next day they fire him.''

<TEXT>
   A reputed Colombian drug cartel leader accused of
trafficking tons of cocaine into the United States was arraigned in
prison for fear fellow smugglers would try to free him, authorities
said.
   Luis Santacruz Echeverri, 35, is accused of heading U.S. drug
operations for the Cali cartel, a Colombian drug gang that rivals
the older Medellin cartel.
   Santacruz, who is being held without bond, pleaded innocent
Wednesday in an office at the Metropolitan Correctional Center south
of Miami before U.S. Magistrate Samuel Smargon.
   It was the first time such a hearing has been held in a prison in
the south Florida federal district, authorities said. No trial date
was set.
   ``He is so important from our information that we believe the
cartel will make efforts to free him, even though we have no overt
indications of any threat,'' Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal James Tasso
said.
   An indictment accuses him of involvement in a 2{-ton cocaine
shipment seized in Chicago in July 1987, the largest such
confiscation at that time; in all, he is accused of trafficking
about 10 tons into the United States.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Toby Vick said the role of Santacruz in
the Cali cartel was more important than that of Carlos Lehder Rivas'
in the rival Medellin cartel. Lehder was convicted in Jacksonville
last year of drug smuggling and is serving a life sentence.
   Vick also said after the arraignment that authorities ``believe
there is a lot more cocaine involved than what he's charged with.''
   Santacruz is a half-brother of Jose Santacruz Londono, a wealthy
Cali businessman who the Drug Enforcement Administration says is
co-leader of the drug cartel and the target of indictments in
Orlando and New York.
   Santacruz is believed to be third in command of the Cali cartel,
following his half-brother and Gilberto Rodriguez, Tasso said.
   Santacruz is a master of disguise, said Tom Cash, head of the DEA
in Miami. Cash said Santacruz visited Miami often, traveling on
phony passports and changing his looks with each trip.
   ``He grows a beard. He shaves it off. He dyes his hair. He puts
on glasses. He's like one of the Marx brothers, merrily changing his
repertoire while he bounces around the city of Miami organizing
these shipments,'' Cash said.
   Agents spotted Santacruz on June 8 in a south Miami neighborhood
and arrested him.
   ``It was like spotting John Dillinger as he walked out of a movie
theater,'' Cash said.
   Santacrus was charged June 14 with 14 drug-related counts.
   The Cali and Medellin cartels probably account for up to 85
percent of U.S. cocaine imports, said DEA spokesman John Fernandes.
   The cartels have cooperated in the past, but by some reports have
been at war since 1988. Within days of Santacruz's arrest, two men
were arrested in West Palm Beach and charged with trying to arrange
a weapons shipment to Colombia for the Cali cartel.
   The guns, along with a drone plane capable of dropping bombs,
were allegedly to be used to kill off Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the top
man in the Medellin cartel who was shot down in a helicopter by Cali
gang members and holed up in a Colombian hideout, authorities said.
   Authorities, however, have no evidence linking Santacruz with the
plot.

<HEAD>Former Longtime Hungarian Leader Dead</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: COMBINES bulletin series. Minor editing.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-time leader Janos Kadar, who came
to power after Soviet troops and tanks crushed the 1956
anti-Stalinist uprising and ruled for 32 years, died today at age
77, the state-run news agency announced.
   MTI said Kadar died after a ``prolonged and grave illness.'' He
had been reported ill in April and was rushed to the hospital Monday
with pneumonia and severe breathing and circulatory problems.
   The agency said the ruling Communist Party ``informs the party
membership, and the entire Hungarian people, with profound sorrow
that comrade Janos Kadar died following a prolonged, grave illness
on Thursday July 6 at 9:16 a.m.''
   Kadar led Hungary to relative prosperity and tolerance in the
1970s, but in the 1980s came to symbolize resistance to further
economic and political reform.
   In May 1988, he was unseated as party general secretary by Karoly
Grosz and named honorary party chairman.
   This May, Kadar lost that post and membership on the party's
policy-setting Central Committee, which wrote him a letter
criticizing mistakes during his rule.
   Kadar's political legacy has since come under fierce attack and
the ruling Communists have moved rapidly to embrace democratic
political changes and market-oriented economic reforms.
   The change in fortunes was typical of a long career that began in
1931 when he joined the illegal Communist Party as a 19-year-old
from a peasant background, with only eight years of schooling.
   Kadar was jailed and seemingly forgotten after a party purge in
1951, but was rehabilitated after the downfall of his Stalinist
rival, Matyas Rakosi, and his rise began.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply for 4th Day, Tokyo Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell sharply today against the
Japanese yen for the fourth consecutive day while the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index rose moderately.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 113.77 points, or 0.34
percent, closing at 33,423.48.
   The dollar closed at 138.90 yen, down 1.30 yen from Wednesday's
close of 140.20 yen. It opened at 138.30 yen and ranged from 137.85
yen to 139.10 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 5.05 yen in four trading days.
   Traders said speculation accounted for today's fluctuations as
investors tried to push the currency below the 138 yen mark.
   Daiwa Bank trader Mitsuhiko Kinugasa said most market players
were inclined to reduce their dollar holdings in anticipation that
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board might move toward easier credit.
   The Fed's policy-making committee met Wednesday and was to meet
again later today.
   ``The move toward easy credit would lead to interest rate cuts,
and would make the interest rate gap between the European currencies
and the dollar even narrower,'' Kinugasa said.
   Central banks of European nations, including West Germany and
France, raised their discount rates in concert last week.
   Lower U.S. interest rates make the dollar less attractive to
foreign investors.
   Kinugasa said, however, many investors avoided major moves before
Friday's announcement of the U.S. jobless rate in June, which will
influence the Fed's decision on whether to cut interest rates.
   On the stock exchange, the yen's strength against the dollar
reassured Japanese investors, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with
New Japan Securities Co.
   He said expectations of an easier credit policy in the United
States were the major buying incentive for Japanese investors.
   Trading was inactive, with first section volume estimated at 550
million, down from Wednesday's 650 million. Among the gainers were
construction and real estate issues.

   Leona Helmsley's lawyer urged a federal jury not
to be prejudiced by the hotel queen's enormous wealth or by the fact
she may not be the nicest person.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' attorney Gerald Feffer said, ``I don't
believe Mrs. Helmsley is charged in the indictment with being a
tough bitch.''
   ``In the United States we don't put people in jail for being
unpopular,'' Feffer said Wednesday in his opening arguments.
   ``The Helmsleys are without a doubt one of the richest couples in
the United States. ... The amount of money they have at their
disposal is extraordinary. It's beyond comprehension.''
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is on trial in U.S. District Court on charges
of evading federal taxes by disguising $4 million in renovations at
her Connecticut mansion as business expenses. She also faces other
fraud and extortion charges.
   Feffer downplayed the $1 million in federal taxes Mrs. Helmsley
is charged with not paying in 1983-85. He said Mrs. Helmsley and her
husband, Harry, paid $57.8 million in federal, state and local taxes
during that time.
   Feffer told the jury that the businesses were entitled to pay
part of the cost of renovating, decorating and operating the country
estate the Helmsleys purchased in 1983 for $11 million.
   In his opening arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita
said the Helmsleys knew the write-offs were illegal.
   ``The Helmsleys were determined to keep down the cost and charge
as much as they could get away with to their companies,'' he said.
   ``They used their position in society to evade one of the most
important responsibilities ... to pay their fair and accurate share
of taxes.''
   The Helmsleys head a $5 billion real-estate and hotel empire.
   Helmsley, 80, who was indicted in April 1988 with his wife, was
removed from the trial after U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr.
found him mentally incompetent.
   DeVita said an outdoor sound system, a marble dance floor and
jade figures worth half a million dollars were among the purchases
for Dunnellen Hall in Greenwich, Conn., that Mrs. Helmsley wrote off
as business expenses.
   He said Mrs. Helmsley also used her hotels and businesses as ``a
personal piggy bank'' to pay for other purchases. He said these
included everything from a $45,000 silver clock for her husband
``right down to her shoes and underwear.''
   DeVita said Mrs. Helmsley yelled at employees and had them fired
if they did not go along with the scheme.
   One executive, who paid out $10,000 for work at the mansion after
getting Helmsley's approval, was forced to personally pay back the
amount to Mrs. Helmsley because she did not approve the contract,
DeVita said.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who appears in advertisements as the ``queen of
the Helmsley Hotels,'' several times shook her head no during
DeVita's hour-long statement and her face became noticeably red.
   The prosecutor charged that the Helmsleys avoided paying for the
renovation of the estate by submitting phony invoices and records to
make it appear that the expenses were incurred by 19 different
companies in their empire.
   He also said Helmsley and co-defendant Frank Turco, a former
Helmsley Hotel executive, extorted ``money, goods and services''
from vendors doing business or seeking contracts with Helmsley
companies.
   He said the scheme unraveled in early 1986 after Turco and a
third defendant, Joseph Licari, who was a top aide to Helmsley, fell
out of favor with Mrs. Helmsley.
   ``The henchmen were no longer there to keep a lid on it,'' DeVita
said.

   Angry neighbors chased two crack users who used a
meat cleaver and baseball bat to kill an 18-year-old man in front of
his mother and sister after he forced them from his building,
authorities said.
   The four-block chase by six men ended in front of a police
station, where the two were arrested on second-degree murder
charges, police said.
   Hermenio Perez, 29, and his 26-year-old brother, Jose, went to
visit a woman who lived in the building early Wednesday and smoked
crack in her apartment, said police Inspector Joseph DeMartino.
   A resident of the building confronted Hermenio Perez, who was
smoking crack at the time, and told him to leave. The dispute turned
into a fistfight involving both brothers and Michael Taylor,
authorities said.
   The brothers left the building, promising to return. Police were
summoned, but arrived after the brothers had left.
   Police said the Perezes returned a short time later outside the
building. One was carrying a cane and a knife, the other had a meat
cleaver and a baseball bat, DeMartino said.
   Taylor and a group of residents confronted the brothers again and
a second altercation began.
   During the melee, Hermenio Perez struck Taylor with the meat
cleaver, and Jose Perez hit him with a baseball bat, DeMartino said.
   Taylor died in front of his mother and sister, DeMartino said.
   Two other people were treated and released at North Central Bronx
Hospital for minor injuries, police said.

   Homeless people began moving mattresses and
shopping carts back into a park early today, hours after their tents
were torn down by city workers.
   Hundreds of people faced off with police as officers sealed off
the park entrance. Ten officers suffered minor injuries and at least
30 people were arrested, charged mostly with disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest, authorities said.
   Tompkins Square Park in the East Village was the site of a riot
last summer. But the confrontation that began Wednesday night was
limited largely to some egg throwing and jeering at police, although
skirmishes continued into early today.
   Late Wednesday, officers appeared to be going out of their way to
be courteous, saying ``please'' and ``thank you'' to those in their
path.
   Homeless people were told to leave the park at 8:30 p.m. under a
new city regulation that took effect Wednesday banning residential
structures, like tents, from parks.
   ``We're giving them a chance to take down their tents and gather
up their belongings and they're being offered shelter,'' said Alan
Moss, a Department of Parks and Recreation deputy commissioner who
was at the scene.
   He said the regulation was aimed at getting rid of unauthorized
structures. ``When you see a big spike being driven into a tree and
boards being nailed together, that doesn't belong in a park,'' he
said.
   The park was reopened at midnight and the homeless began moving
mattresses and shopping carts back inside.
   Deputy Police Chief Charles Reuther said there were no plans to
stop the homeless people from returning ``as long as they don't
bring structures.''
   City Human Resources Administration workers with vans were in the
park to transport those who wanted to go to city shelters for the
homeless.
   Helmeted police officers blocked the entrance to the lower
Manhattan park while workers dismantled the large cardboard boxes
and other makeshift structures homeless people had been living in.
   No raids were planned at other parks because ``we don't have any
other place where we have structures going up,'' Moss said.
   Meanwhile, several hundred people gathered around the park. Most
appeared to be curious rather than hostile.
   While the mood was tense, the most serious acts involved egg
throwings and rubbish burning, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Edward
Burns.
   Dozens of people were living in the park on Aug. 7 when police
tried to enforce a curfew that was later revoked. A riot ensued,
injuring 52 officers and 18 civilians. More than 100 complaints of
police brutality were filed.

<HEAD>China Expresses Outrage Over U.S. Moves Toward Sanctions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China expressed outrage today at recent moves to
impose additional sanctions on Beijing by members of the U.S.
Congress who ``sanctimoniously claim to be the guardians of `human
rights.'''
   It accused the United States of seeking to overthrow China's
government and turn the country capitalist, saying Washington had
helped foment unrest.
   The House of Representatives voted June 29 to suspend trade and
development programs with China, prohibit the sale of police
equipment and suspend transfers of nuclear technology.
   ``To those people in the American Congress who deliberately
distort the facts and interfere with China's internal affairs, we
cannot but express our indignation,'' said the Communist Party
newspaper, the People's Daily.
   Congress' move followed broader sanctions halting military sales
and suspending high-level exchanges imposed by President Bush in the
wake of the bloody military suppression of China's pro-democracy
movement.
   Troops backed by tanks cleared central Beijing of protesters on
June 4, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   ``Any sovereign country would use the same legal and reasonable
methods when faced with a situation of this magnitude,'' the
People's Daily said.
   ``But some anti-China and anti-socialist congressmen in the
United States refuse to accept the truth. They use their class
instinct of anti-communism to interfere in China's internal affairs
...
   ``They never talk about the suppression of the black human rights
movement or student protests against the Vietnam War in their
country, but sanctimoniously claim to be the guardians of `human
rights.'''
   China's Communist leaders have kept up a barrage of anti-U.S.
criticism in an attempt to discredit U.S. news reports about their
suppression of dissent.
   The Liberation Daily, Shanghai's Communist Party paper, said
organizers of student protests in the United States must give
detailed personal information and that permission to demonstrate can
be rescinded at any time.
   It listed student protest incidents in the United States from the
1950s to 1970s, including the killing by National Guardsmen of four
people during an anti-Vietnam War protest at Kent State University
in Ohio in 1970.
   Zhao Ziyang, ousted as Communist Party leader for opposing the
use of troops to crush the pro-democracy movement, was hit with more
broadsides.
   A lawmaker charged him with neglecting the leadership of the
working class.
   ``The People's Republic of China is a Communist country that uses
the coalition of the workers and the farmers as a foundation for
democratic dictatorship,'' Wang Houde told the National People's
Congress, whose steering committee ends a session today.
   ``But for a certain period we have been negligent in this
respect, and Comrade Zhao Ziyang's behavior is closely linked to
this,'' Wang said. ``Comrade Zhao Ziyang did not manage well
relations between workers.''
   Zhao has been stripped of his party and government posts, but
continuing references to him in the press as ``comrade'' indicate he
retains party membership.
   The newspaper Economic Reference charged that Washington is
seeking to overthrow China's government by turning the country
capitalist, guiding and supporting forces seeking revoltionary
change, stirring up protests among minority ethnic populations,
spreading anti-communist propaganda and cultivating dissidents under
the banner of human rights.
   Its Wednesday editions said the U.S. government-run Voice of
America, ``clearly reflecting the American government's policy,
started the most disgusting rumors, fanning the flames, and even
acted as a contact between reactionary forces in China and the
United States.''
   ``The truth already has been exposed: American influence was
behind the supporters of the few people who created this turmoil in
Beijing that turned into a counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' it said.
   VOA has an estimated listening audience in China of tens of
millions and official media have repeatedly singled it out for
criticism.
   The government last month expelled a VOA correspondent, accusing
him of spreading false reports and violating martial law.
   In spite of the anti-American diatribe, China continues to try
and lure back foreign businessmen who fled the country after the
crackdown and assure potential foreign investors that the country
has returned to stability.
   Deng Yingchao, head of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries and as widow of former Premier
Chou En-lai a prominent spokesperson for China's international
policy, told a Japanese lawmaker today that China's open-door and
economic reform policies would not change.

arts champion saga, came in third at $14.3 million.
   In fourth place was ``Ghostbusters II,'' the comedy sequel
starring Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, with receipts of $13.1
million. In fifth was ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which
grossed $11.1 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society,'' a modern-day version of ``Goodbye Mr.
Chips'' featuring Robin Williams, was sixth with $10.1 million.
``Great Balls of Fire!'' made its debut in seventh place but
collected just $5.6 million in wide release.
   Playing in only 353 theaters, Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing''
grossed a healthy $5.2 million to land in eighth place.
   ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' was next with $3.7 million
and ``Field of Dreams'' finished 10th with $2.8 million.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
choppy European trading early today amid speculation that the U.S.
Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. Gold prices fell in
Europe.
   After dropping in nervous early dealings, the dollar recovered
some ground in late morning trading and some traders talked of the
currency being oversold Wednesday in New York.
   Dealers said the market would look to the U.S. employment data
scheduled for release Friday for clues about the pace of U.S.
economic growth.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell for the fourth consecutive day to a closing 138.90
Japanese yen, down from 140.20 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in
London, it edged back up to 139.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8900 West German marks, down from 1.8907
   _1.6210 Swiss francs, up from 1.6195
   _6.4095 French francs, down from 6.4125
   _2.1340 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1495
   _1,366.60 Italian lire, down from 1,380.50
   _1.1905 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1909
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6205 from $1.6155 late
Wednesday.
   Gold bullion opened in London at $384.40 a troy ounce, down from
$385.50 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $384.30.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $383.20, down from $384.50 bid
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.38 to a closing bid of
$384.71.
   Silver bullion fell in London to $5.37 a troy ounce from $5.38
bid late Wednesday.

   Abe Stolar went to a baseball game to soak up some
long-missed Americana and watched his native town's Cubs, a team
that hasn't won a World Series during the 58 years Stolar lived in
the Soviet Union.
   ``It's beautiful here. It should be a painting,'' Stolar said
Wednesday night at Wrigley Field.
   The 77-year-old Stolar and his Soviet-born wife, Gita Rozovskaya,
arrived in Chicago on Tuesday from Israel, where the family settled
earlier this year after a 14-year battle to leave the Soviet Union.
   The Stolars joined U.S. Sen. Paul Simon and his wife, Jeanne, at
a game between the Cubs and San Diego Padres. Simon, D-Ill., met
Stolar during a 1980 trip to Moscow and was instrumental in securing
his release.
   ``This is much more comfortable, the Soviets just have benches at
events like this,'' said Stolar.
   Stolar was told by a reporter that the Cubs haven't won a World
Series since he left town. ``It'll come some day, don't worry,''
said Stolar.
   Having lived most of his life in the Soviet Union, Stolar admits
he's not much of a baseball fan. So why take in a ballgame on his
second day back in the United States?
   ``It's America,'' Simon said of the sport.
   Earlier Wednesday, Simon joined Stolar on a visit to the West
Side Chicago neighborhood where he grew up before his family pulled
up stakes and emigrated to the Soviet Union in 1931.
   ``I didn't expect anything,'' Stolar said of his sentimental
journey to Humboldt Park. ``That's what keeps me young. Everything I
get is a gift.''
   Spanish has replaced the Yiddish and Polish that once filled the
neighborhood's tenements.
   But Stolar found the soda fountain where as a teen-ager he mixed
ice cream concoctions, the third-floor apartment where he heard
adults passionately debate socialism and the high school where he
acted in a play.
   ``It all looks strange and new to me'' said Stolar, who found his
childhood home replaced by a garbage-strewn lot, ``but somehow it
feels like home.''
   Stolar plans to tour the city today. On Tuesday, he leaves
Chicago, the first stop on a 12-city trip to meet with Jewish-rights
leaders.
   Stolar's parents emigrated in 1910 from Russia to Chicago, where
he was born two years later.
   But in 1931, disillusioned by the Great Depression and drawn back
to their homeland by reports that the Bolshevik Revolution had
created a workers' paradise, the family headed east.
   Stolar's father was killed in the Stalinist purges, and his
mother and sister died after being sent to concentration camps in
Siberia.
   Stolar himself was wounded serving in the Soviet Army during
World War II, worked for Radio Moscow as a translator and announcer
and later married and had a son of his own, Michael.
   He was increasingly disillusioned with life in the Soviet Union,
but for years there was virtually no chance of emigrating.
   In 1974, prompted by concerns about his son's future and eased
U.S.-Soviet relations, Stolar applied for an exit visa.
   Stolar was disappointed several times in his effort to get his
family out. He became a cause celebre for several U.S.-based emigre
organizations, and dined with President Reagan in Moscow during last
year's summit.
   In March, Stolar finally left the Soviet Union with his wife, his
son and daughter-in-law, and their two children.

<HEAD>New US Ambassador Named, Ministry Changes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese legislators today named a new ambassador
to the United States and replaced the ministers of labor and
chemical industry in an unusual mid-year shuffle.
   The National People's Congress' steering committee made the
appointments during a special session called to study and affirm the
ruling Communist Party's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   The cabinet changes did not appear linked to the crackdown that
ousted party leader Zhao Ziyang.
   The evening television news said Zhu Qizhen, vice foreign
minister, was appointed ambassador to Washington to replace Han Xu,
who has held the post four years. The report said Han's term was up.
   Han, along with China's other ambassadors, was recalled to
Beijing last week for what the Foreign Ministry said was a regular
meeting, but Western diplomats said such recalls were not regular.
   Zhu, 61, speaks English fluently and formerly headed the
ministry's American and Oceanic Affairs Department.
   His appointment came as Chinese-U.S. relations continued to
worsen with the Foreign Ministry rejecting a U.S. protest over
soldiers' spraying gunfire at American and other foreign diplomatic
housing a few days after the army cleared central Beijing of
protesters, killing hundreds.
   The United States charged in its protest Monday that soldiers
staged an alleged sniper attack from the diplomatic compound so they
could deliberately target American and other diplomats' apartments.
   No one was hurt in the incident.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Assistant Foreign Minister
Liu Huaqiu met today with U.S. Ambassador James Lilley and gave him
a note saying China ``categorically rejects the U.S. Embassy's
groundless accusation.''
   ``It is entirely futile for the U.S. Embassy to attempt to exert
pressure on the Chinese government by making a big fuss about an
incident which has already been resolved,'' the note said.
   Xinhua said Labor Minister Luo Gan, 53, who was appointed last
year, was replaced with Ruan Chongwu, a Moscow-educated party
veteran who was minister of public security from 1985-88.
   Ruan, 56, also was deputy secretary of Shanghai's party committee
in the early 1980's under Jiang Zemin, the new national party chief.
He has since last yeasr been vice minister in charge of the State
Science and Technology Commission.
   Xinhua did not mention Luo in its brief report on Ruan's
appointment, and gave no reason for the change. However, Hong Kong's
New Evening Post newspaper said Luo already had been given a new
post as secretary-general of the State Council, China's cabinet.
   China faces a serious problem of stagnant or declining labor
productivity. Productivity climbed in the early 1980's when senior
leader Deng Xiaoping enacted reforms that allowed worker to be given
incentive pay.
   But continued tight control over job changes, overstaffing and
inflation have counteracted some of the early gains, and many
workers spend hours of their workday drinking tea and playing chess.
   Gu Xiulian, until recently governor of the eastern province of
Jiangsu, was appointed minister of chemical industry, Xinhua said.
   She replaces Qin Zhongda, 65, who resigned, it said.
   Gu, 52, is a member of the party Central Committee, and was
China's first female governor. She was trained in metallurgy and
electrical mechanics.
   Xinhua said both new ministers were nominated by Premier Li Peng.

<TEXT>
   The Agent Orange fund has dispensed $12 million
to thousands of Vietnam veterans, their families and support
organizations, and up to $60 million more will be handed out in the
next year, overseers of the fund say.
   The fund was created in 1984 when seven chemical companies agreed
to pay $180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by
veterans and their families who alleged injuries from exposure to
the chemical during the war.
   ``We're moving very quickly. We're ahead of where I thought we
would be at this time,'' said Dennis Rhoades, director of the Agent
Orange Class Assistance Program, a social-service fund created to
distribute some of the money.
   By June 30, $11.8 million in cash was distributed during the
fund's first year, according to an annual report Wednesday. The
report said 6,039 veterans or their survivors received $9.5 million;
the rest went to 13 organizations.
   The program administered by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein
is expected to distribute some $300 million in all by the end of
1994, including as much as $60 million during the next 12 months,
the report said.
   Agent Orange, a herbicide widely used by American forces to
destroy ground cover during the Vietnam War, contained the highly
toxic chemical dioxin.
   In their lawsuit, veterans said exposure to Agent Orange caused
cancer and other illnesses, as well as birth defects in their
children.
   Distribution of the money in the fund was held up by challenges
for four years until the U.S. Supreme Court a year ago refused to
hear appeals.

   The government today extended tough
censorship laws to foreign media and said security forces can shoot
Sinhalese radicals engaging in violence or putting up
anti-government posters.
   ``No news whatsoever can go out of this country without being
censored,'' Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratna told a news
conference. ``If you cannot conform to that, please leave the
country.''
   ``I will cancel your visas and deport you if you violate the
censorship,'' he told reporters, who included several foreign
correspondents. ``If I decide to cancel a visa, no appeals will be
considered.''
   The government also said today that talks with India about
withdrawing Indian troops should be held in Sri Lanka. The 40,000
troops were invited to Sri Lanka nearly two years ago to enforce a
peace plan, but the Colombo government wants them out by the end of
the month.
   The censorship laws, which ban reporting on the radical Sinhalese
movement, went into effect this morning. The ban was announced
Wednesday and, initially, foreign media organizations were exempted.
   Wijeratna said the move is part of a crackdown on the radicals,
who have been trying to overthrow the government for two years.
   The government, controlled by the island's Sinhalese majority,
says the radicals are behind a 4-week-old strike by transport
operators, which has crippled the economy of this troubled Indian
Ocean island nation.
   ``We will not allow the government to be displaced by gun-toting
criminals,'' Wijeratna said. ``Our armed forces and police have been
given wide powers to deal with all form of subversion in the most
ruthless manner.''
   He said this included shoot-on-sight orders on those indulging in
violence or putting up anti-government posters. All public meetings
and trade union rallies have also been banned, he said.
   The government blames Sinhalese militants for at least 3,500
killings since they launched an anti-government campaign in July
1987 to protest peace overtures being made to separatist Tamil
rebels.
   The Sinhalese militants said too many concessions were being
given to the minority Tamils, who have been fighting since 1983 for
an independent nation on the island's northern and eastern sectors.
   Since May, the government has been holding talks with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most powerful rebel militia.
The Tigers rejected the 1987 overtures and carried on the war for a
Tamil homeland, but last month they agreed to cease hostilities
against the government and negotiate a settlement.
   However, they continue to fight the 40,000 Indian soldiers
deployed on the island to help end the Tamil insurrection. The New
Delhi government has refused to stop fighting the rebels until they
surrender their weapons.
   India has also not agreed to Colombo's requests to pull out the
soldiers by July 29, the second anniversary of their landing in Sri
Lanka, saying a hasty withdrawal could lead to even greater ethnic
violence.
   India has suggested that negotiations be held for a gradual
pullout. On Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi offered to
discuss a timetable.
   ``If India wants to sit down and talk about the troop withdrawal,
they will have to send somebody to talk to President (Ranasinghe)
Premadasa, who is handling the issue personally,'' Wijeratna told a
news conference today.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
complain of discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent
of the population and control the government and military.
   At least 9,000 people have been killed in the Tamil insurrection.

   Army technicians strapped rocket sections
to reinforced stands for the destruction today of the nation's last
Pershing 1A and the first-ever elimination of an entire class of
nuclear weapons.
   Officials at the Longhorn Army Ammunition plant planned to fire
the two sections of the unarmed, 5,500-pound ballistic missile in
horizontal position today. After consuming their solid fuel, the
sections were to be crushed.
   The operation comes under terms of the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty signed in 1987 by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The INF treaty requires elimination of 859 American
intermediate-range and shorter range missiles and 1,752 similar
Soviet missiles within three years.
   A 10-member Soviet inspection team was to monitor today's
destruction of the 169th and last Pershing 1A. Hundreds of larger
Pershing 2 missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles are also
being destroyed under the treaty.
   The Soviets began destroying several classes of similar missiles
a year ago.
   Nuclear warheads are removed beforehand from the missiles marked
for destruction, which have a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.
   The destruction of the Pershing 1A is being handled by Morton
Thiokol Inc., which built many of the Pershing motors.
   In September, then-Vice President Bush made a campaign stop of
the first missile destruction at Longhorn, hailing the event as
``the day we began to reverse the arms race.''

   Patricia Spahic knows too well what it means to
suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
   During a fight scene in the final act of the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival's production of ``Hamlet'' Wednesday night, a
dagger sailed into the third row and hit Mrs. Spahic. The blade
glanced her forehead, leaving a cut.
   ``It was almost like a setup,'' Mrs. Spahic's daughter, Mary Beth
Spahic, 30, of Ambridge, said today.
   ``You couldn't imagine you'd be struck with anything falling from
a play. Yet everything that was happening was so close to the
audience _ smoke and a trap door slamming _ that you also question
why somebody wouldn't get hurt.''
   Mrs. Spahic, 63, of Ambridge, was treated at a hospital and
released.
   ``It was just a slice, a gash. It drew blood,'' said Miss Spahic,
wo sat beside her mother at the 560-seat Stephen Foster Memorial
theater and spoke for her today. ``She's not upset or anything, but
I don't think she'll be laughing today.''
   The mishap occurred during the fight in which Hamlet and Laertes
both die. As Hamlet drew his dagger, it slipped his grasp.
   Richard McMillan, who played Hamlet, immediately stopped the show
and asked if there was a doctor in the house as the lights came up.
A physician rushed to the woman's side and helped the stage crew
escort her to an ambulance.
   The play resumed within minutes.

<HEAD>Sentencing Judge Weighed North's Achievements Against His Crimes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 12th graf, Fifty-eight, with pardon request and
White House reply</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in Oliver L. North's case balanced
the former presidential aide's achievements against his Iran-Contra
crimes to fashion a punishment that could defuse the controversy
over his prosecution.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell's sentencing decision
Wednesday answered a question posed by defense lawyer Brendan V.
Sullivan Jr., who asked: ``What is Oliver North's good life worth?''
   Before placing him on two years' probation, Gesell told North he
had considered ``the many highly commendable aspects of your life''
as a Marine hero in Vietnam and later as a staff aide at the
National Security Council.
   Against North's 20 years of service as a Marine Corps officer and
a presidential aide, Gesell weighed the three crimes for which North
he stands convicted _ destroying or altering Iran-Contra documents,
helping falsify a chronology of U.S.-Iran arms sales to deceive
Congress and illegally accepting a home security system.
   By giving North what he called ``a chance to start something good
and wholesome for the future,'' the judge made it harder for North's
supporters to portray their hero as a martyr.
   Gesell told North that while he was a ``low-ranking subordinate
working to carry out initiatives of a few cynical superiors'' he
didn't consider him blameless.
   ``As you stand here now, you are not the fall guy for this tragic
breach of the public trust,'' the judge said.
   ``You're here now because of your own conduct when the truth was
coming out,'' Gesell said of North's role in helping ``keep Congress
and others from finding out what was happening.''
   That said, Gesell gave North a suspended three-year sentence,
imposed a $150,000 fine and ordered him to work 1,200 hours while on
probation to help administrate a program to keep inner-city youths
off drugs.
   In doing so, the judge may have lowered the volume of the debate
about whether North was a scapegoat and the victim of a hard-nosed
prosecutor determined to get scalps from the Iran-Contra
investigation.
   The sentence also may relieve some of the pressure on President
Bush to pardon North now that the retired Marine lieutenant colonel
is not facing time behind bars.
   Fifty-eight House members asked Bush to give North a pardon, but
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president had not
considered granting one.
   ``A far more important thing in the North case was that legal
accountability be established, not that imprisonment be decreed,''
said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor. The
sentence ``focuses the country on the right issue.''
   ``Little would have been gained and much would have been lost by
adding fuel to the fires of martyrdom in this case,'' Tribe said.
   ``I don't think that anybody or very few people wanted all of the
additional chaos in the country, the additional hard feelings that
we have too much of right now, of having Oliver North trundled off
to jail waving the American flag,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who co-chaired the 1987
congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair, said most of his
colleagues ``would not really feel comfortable seeing Oliver North
go to jail.''
   The judge urged North to put the controversy and political hoopla
behind him.
   ``You can continue to flame the myth by which you have supported
yourself during these recent difficult years or you can turn around
now and do something useful,'' the judge said, referring to North's
appearances on the lecture circuit where he reportedly commands
$25,000 for each performance.
   ``I fashioned a sentence that punishes you. It is my duty to do
that,'' Gesell said. ``But it leaves the future up to you.''
   Indeed, North's permanent disqualification from holding federal
office for altering or destroying National Security Council
documents will undermine efforts by his supporters to promote a
political career.
   The judge told North ``you still lack full understanding ... of
how the public service has been tarnished.''
   ``Nonetheless, what you believe is your own business and jail
would only harden your misconceptions'' about how government should
work, the judge said.
   Jail might have also hardened in the minds of many Americans the
image of a legal system indifferent to the achievements of a former
Marine they view as a folk hero.

<HEAD>TV Guide: Bush Had Off-Camera Coaching During Rather Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's quick comebacks during his
explosive interview with Dan Rather last year were not entirely
off-the-cuff, a new book says.
   Several of the presidential candidate's responses came from cue
cards scrawled by media consultant Roger Ailes, CBS correspondent
Bob Schieffer and Gary Paul Gates say.
   Excerpts from their book, ``The Acting President: Ronald Reagan
and the Supporting Players Who Helped Him Create the Illusion That
Held America Spellbound,'' appear in the July 8 issue of TV Guide.
   During the live, January 1988 interview, then-Vice President Bush
told Rather, who had been questioning him on his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, ``It's not fair to judge my whole career by a
rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by
those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?''
   Bush referred to Rather's walk-off from the CBS set in 1987 when
a tennis match ran into news time. It caused the network to ``go
black'' for six minutes.
   ``What people in the bureau and viewers at home could not see was
that the response had not been entirely spontaneous. As the
interview progressed, the crafty Ailes had stationed himself beside
the camera,'' Schieffer and Gates wrote.
   ``If Bush seemed to be struggling for a response, Ailes would
write out a key word in huge letters on his yellow legal pad and
hold it just beneath the camera in Bush's line of vision.
   ``Just before Bush had shouted that it was not fair to judge his
career on Iran, Ailes had written out on his legal pad the word `not
fair to judge career ... Yours.' Three times during the interview,
Bush's answer had come after Ailes had prompted him with key words
or phrases scribbled on the legal pad.''
   Schieffer and Gates said that before the interview Bush had been
stirred up by aides who wanted to end the candidate's image as a
``wimp.''
   Ailes ``was like a boxing coach,'' CBS deputy bureau chief Mary
Martin is quoted as saying. ``It seemed like he just wanted to keep
Bush stirred up. He was waving his arms and telling Bush, `He's
gonna sandbag you.'''

   A bomb today extensively damaged a London book
store whose sister shop was attacked by arsonists in what
authorities said was a campaign against Salman Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   Many Moslems consider the novel blasphemous and the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called in February for the author to be
sought out and killed.
   Scotland Yard said no one was injured in the 3:30 a.m. blast from
a homemade bomb inside Collet's book store on Charing Cross Road in
central London. Damage to the store was extensive. Windows were
blown out and the explosion was followed by a fire.
   Collet's said the fire destroyed the first floor and set off
water sprinklers which destroyed thousands of books.
   Three ``improvised devices'' were found at the scene, Scotland
Yard said in a statement. No further information was immediately
available.
   Devices in police parlance normally means bombs, but it was not
clear whether these were in addition to the bomb that caused the
explosion or whether one of the three devices exploded.
   Police said anti-terrorist detectives are investigating but gave
no indication who is believed responsible for the bombing. No one
claimed responsibility.
   Store manager Carol Taylor said the employees believe the
attackers mistook the store for another branch of Collet's just 100
yards away which stocks ``The Satanic Verses'' and was firebombed on
April 9.
   Ms. Taylor said her store stopped selling Rushdie's best-seller
after employees voted in December that it should not be stocked.
   A sign reading ``We don't sell `The Satanic Verses''' was placed
in the window, Ms. Taylor said, but it was removed last month
because managers thought the controversy had died down.
   ``I heard about the attack on the news this morning and I thought
to myself, `They've got the wrong shop,''' Ms. Taylor said, adding
the store probably will be shut for several months.
   Police said the April bombing was part of an intimidation
campaign by Moslem militants trying to halt sales of Rushdie's book.
   Rushdie, a naturalized Briton born in India, has been in hiding
since Khomeini, spiritual leader of Iran's fundamentalist
revolution, on Feb. 14 called on Moslems to find and kill him.
   Two Iranian Moslem clergymen backed Khomeini's call by offering a
total of $5.2 million for Rushdie's death.
   Sales of the book in Britain and elsewhere rocketed following the
publicity created by Khomeini's death call.

<HEAD>Eagleburger Says Reform Pace Depends on East Europeans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
said today that while the United States and other Western
governments intend to assist Poland and Hungary in developing
free-market economies, the pace of reform depends primarily on the
East Europeans themselves.
   ``In the last analysis, the decisions are going to have to be
made in Warsaw and Budapest,'' Eagleburger said in a
government-sponsored telecast to Europe as President Bush prepared
for a visit next week to the two Soviet bloc capitals.
   ``The president will be bringing some support,'' Eagleburger
said. ``How much and what kind I will leave until he gets there.''
   The State Department official said the U.S. purpose was to help
the Polish and Hungarian economies adopt a free-market system and to
place decisions in the hands of private individuals instead of the
communist governments.
   But Eagleburger seemed to indicate U.S. support would be
conditioned on changes by the Polish and Hungarian governments.
Reform, he said, ``has to be done basically by the peoples and
governments involved.''
   He also cautioned that reform should proceed at a measured pace,
without explaining what potential perils he foresaw.
   The U.S. interest in helping is that economic change will ease
the divisions between East and West in Europe and make further U.S.
and Soviet troops reductions there possible, Eagleburger said.
   Bush last month proposed cutbacks to equal levels of 275,000
troops, as well as reductions in tanks, artillery and other
non-nuclear weapons. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev earlier
made his own dramatic proposals for cutbacks.
   On related issues, Eagleburger said U.S. policy calls for the
reunification of West Germany and East Germany into one nation, and
he predicted the U.S. Senate would follow the lead of the House and
approve easier credit terms for Hungary.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Part of Lawsuit Against Rob Lowe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today dismissed part of a lawsuit
accusing Rob Lowe of enticing a teen-age girl into sexual antics on
videotape.
   The girl's mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, had sued the heartthrob
actor under a Georgia law involving the seduction of a minor
daughter, and she also alleged that Lowe intentionally inflicted
emotional distress on her family.
   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell, who heard arguments last
week on Lowe's request that the lawsuit be thrown out, agreed to
dismiss the claim of emotional distress, saying the suit did not
offer enough facts to warrant the allegation.
   But the judge refused to dismiss the claim for damages for
seduction.
   The lawsuit stems from a videotape Lowe purportedly made in his
hotel suite while in Atlanta last summer for the Democratic National
Convention.
   The tape _ widely circulated on Atlanta's party circuit and shown
electronically censored on TV news _ apparently shows Lowe, Ms.
Wilson's daughter, Jan Parsons, and another woman in sexual
escapades.
   In May, Ms. Wilson sued, contending Lowe enticed her daughter,
then 16, into having sex with another woman while Lowe videotaped
them.
   Edgar Neely III, an attorney for Lowe, had argued that the
lawsuit should be dismissed because only a custodial parent may sue
under Georgia law. Neely said the girl's parents are divorced, and
her father has custody.
   But J. Hue Henry, Ms. Wilson's attorney, said that Miss Parsons
was living with her mother at the time and that the tape humiliated
the family and strained Ms. Wilson's relationship with her daughter.
   Lowe, 25, is the star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and
``About Last Night.''

<TEXT>
   The alleged head of a money-laundering ring
has pleaded guilty in a secret agreement with prosecutors. It was
the first guilty plea from an undercover operation that handled $32
million in drug profits.
   Roberto Baez-Alcaino, 51, was among 85 people and banking
institutions indicted as a result of the Customs Service's Operation
C Chase, named for the C in C-note, or $100 bill.
   Over a two-year period, federal agents infiltrated powerful
Colombian money-laundering syndicates and helped launder money
intended mainly for Colombian drug traffickers, including the
Medellin cartel.
   Baez-Alcaino, his wife and two associates pleaded guilty in
closed hearings Wednesday, but the charges involved and the deal
struck with prosecutors were kept secret.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys urged the judge in private to
let agreement remain secret. In open court, they said only that they
were ``concerned'' about unspecified ``sensitive related matters.''
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich granted the request
over objections of an attorney for The Tampa Tribune, but she did
direct prosecutors and defense attorneys to review and edit the plea
agreements so at least some information could be made public.
   The government has yet to comply. U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman
said his office wouldn't comment. Baez-Alcaino's attorney was on a
flight back to Los Angeles when the judge ordered the attorneys to
agree on an edited plea bargain.
   Gregg Thomas, the Tribune's attorney, said the newspaper would
appeal the decision.
   ``The public is entitled to know the end result of a criminal
indictment, which in this case is a plea agreement,'' he said.
``Without that knowledge, how can we evaluate the performance of the
government?''
   Baez-Alcaino was charged with managing a cocaine ring that
generated the bulk of the $32 million by selling drugs in five
cities.
   Also pleading guilty were Baez-Alcaino's wife, Gloria; his top
lieutenant, Joaquin Casals of New York City; and Edgar Rendon Nino,
charged with being a bagman for Baez-Alcaino.
   The sting, made public in October, is best known for the
indictment of BCCI Holdings, a Luxembourg-based holding company for
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and nine of its
officers.
   In congressional hearings this year, BCCI and an assistant
director of its Miami office, who was among those indicted, were
identified as helping Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
hide drug-trafficking profits.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug charges.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese Christian and Syrian army gunners
blasted Beirut's segregated residential suburbs with thunderous
barrages of shellfire today. Police said four people were killed and
eight wounded.
   The armies ignored a joint appeal for a cease-fire by France and
the Soviet Union. The fighting ended a two-day lull that came after
Lebanese Moslem forces reopened land crossings dividing the
capital's Christian and Moslem sectors.
   Police said Syrian troops attacked a ship cruising off the
Christian port of Byblos. The troops have enforced a 16-week
blockade to prevent the Christians from getting arms supplies.
   ``The ship is cruising back and forth three miles off Byblos with
shells falling around it,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing regulations. He said he did not have details of
the ship's identity, owners or cargo. Byblos is 20 miles north of
Beirut.
   The mainly Christian Lebanese army accused the Syrians of
provoking the battle with early morning shelling of residential
centers in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave where a million
people are trapped.
   A spokesman for Maronite Gen. Michel Aoun said his gunners
responded ``only against Syrian artillery and rocket emplacements.''
But howitzer rounds also rained on areas that do not harbor
batteries.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called on
residents of Moslem west Beirut to stay away from areas around
Syrian artillery.
   The bombardment caught people in the morning rush hour.
   Panicking motorists honked their horns hysterically and sped in
all directions. Pedestrians dove for cover and shopkeepers hurriedly
lowered their shutters against flying shrapnel.
   Rockets flew overhead, and artillery blasts shook both sectors as
the city streets emptied.
   The police spokesman said four people were killed and eight
wounded, bringing the toll to 401 killed and 1,546 wounded since
fighting began March 8 between Aoun's mostly Christian troops and
allied Syrian and Druse forces.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Francois
Mitterrand of France appealed Wednesday for a cease-fire to be
``rigorously respected'' by all Lebanese factions.
   Syria is Moscow's chief Arab ally. Paris, which ruled Lebanon
until its independence in 1943, traditionally supports the
Christians but has assumed a neutral role in the latest fighting.
   In a joint statement ending a visit to France by Gorbachev, the
two leaders expressed support for an Arab League initiative to
settle the 14-year civil war but also said their countries can help
``notably in the framework of the United Nations Security Council.''
   France and the Soviet Union are among the five permanent members
of the council. Britain, China and the United States are the others.
   Gorbachev and Mitterrand said they are ``convinced that Lebanon
must remain sovereign, independent, united, with its territorial
integrity respected.''
   Aoun has pledged to drive out the 40,000 Syrian troops in
Lebanon, charging they have violated their 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems. But his 20,000
troops are outnumbered 4-to-1 by those of Syria and allied Lebanese
Moslem militias.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Watergate Hotel, which earned a place in
history because of the 1972 Democratic party headquarters burglary,
is for sale.
   The British Coal Board has put the 237-room hotel up for sale,
along with the lease it holds on an office building in the Watergate
complex, the land under three cooperative apartment buildings there
and retail space in the Watergate shopping mall.
   Pension fund officials said Wednesday they want to pull out of
the U.S. real estate market because growth prospects are better in
other countries.
   Wendy Luscombe, president of Pan American Properties Inc. and
Buckingham Holdings Inc., the American companies that manage the
fund's holdings, would not comment on the asking price. Her office
said the sale was part of a $1 billion portfolio and referred calls
to Morgan Stanley Realty, where a knowledgeable person was not
reached immediately.
   Estimates for the complex, which was completed in 1965, have
ranged from $28 million to $71 million, according to today's
editions of The Washington Post.
   The break-in at the sixth-floor offices of the Democratic
National Committee in the Watergate Office Building next door to the
hotel made the complex something of a landmark and the name of the
site also became the name of the nation's biggest political scandal.
   G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, employees of President
Nixon's 1972 re-election committee and masterminds of the burglary,
waited in their room in the hotel while the break-in was being
carried out. Nixon's resignation was forced two years later because
of White House efforts to coverup involvement in the burglary.
   ``It has historic value,'' said Stephen J. Wayne, a Georgetown
University professor of government.
   The British pension fund's U.S. portfolio, valued at nearly $1
billion, includes 10 shopping centers, two shopping malls and office
buildings in New York City and San Francisco.

   Heavy rain continued for a second day today on the already
saturated East Coast, and flash flood watches were posted in seven
states.
   Thunderstorms produced large hail and strong winds in Minnesota
late Wednesday. Winds gusted to 62 mph at International Falls and
blew over vehicles and downed trees at Pelican Lake. The storms
weakened early today.
   The rains in the Northeast were remnants of Tropical Storm
Allison, which came ashore last week and dumped up to 20 inches of
rain in Texas and Louisiana.
   Wednesday's storms were blamed for at least two deaths.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from Florida and the
central Gulf Coast to New England early today, with rain most
prevalent from central Virginia to coastal New England.
   Flash flood watches were in effect in North Carolina, Virginia,
West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.
   Two people drowned and a third person was missing today in
Delaware, where up to 10 inches of rain drenched the state. More
than 450 people were forced to evacuate their homes. Rainfall
amounts included 9.52 inches at Claymont and 6.63 at Wilmington, the
highest 24-hour total for any July day in 95 years of recordkeeping.
   Rainfall records also were broken throughout New Jersey,
including Newark, which logged 2.45 inches of rain.
   Rain washed out track beds and reduced Amtrak service between
Washington and New York City to one track. The hardest hit area was
between Wilmington and Philadelphia, where rain fell at up to 3
inches an hour, said Amtrak spokeswoman Cliff Black.
   In Philadelphia, three workers were injured at the Naval Shipyard
when a tarpaulin tore open and sent them plunging 40 feet to the
deck of an aircraft carrier, a shipyard spokesman said. The three
were bailing rainwater out of the tarp.
   A driving thunderstorm stranded hundreds of motorists in Cobb
County, Ga., overturning mobile homes and flooding streets. Police
today said crews worked past midnight to free the drivers, hours
after the rain ended.
   Near Alexandria, La., 56 residents in Rapides Parish were
evacuated by Wednesday night as officials warned of backwater
flooding.
   A few showers dampened western New Mexico and southeastern
Arizona today.
   Record high temperatures for the date Wednesday were set in
Wyoming, North Dakota, Nebraska, Florida and Colorado, where at
least seven communities broke the 100-degree mark.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
northern Minnesota across northern Wisconsin to upper Michigan;
along the East Coast from southern and central New England across
much of New York state through Florida; and over Alabama and
Mississippi and much of Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky and West
Virginia.
   Predicted highs: in the upper 80s and in the low 90s from
northern New England across the lower Great Lakes, from the South
Carolina coast across Florida, over the lower Mississippi Valley,
northern Minnesota and the upper Missouri Valley; in the 90s over
the remainder of the Mississippi Valley, the remainder of the
Plains, from southern Montana across New Mexico, over the Great
Basin and the central Pacific Coast; 100 degrees and higher from
western Montana across Utah and central California: from 115 to 120
over the Desert Southwest; and in the 80s over much of the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 96 degrees at Phoenix.

   A Palestinian shouting ``Allahu Akbar''
grabbed the steering wheel of a crowded passenger bus today and
forced it into a deep ravine where it burst into flames, police
said. Fourteen people were reported killed and 27 injured, including
five Americans.
   Police Commissioner David Kraus said other victims were believed
still trapped inside the bus, which was gutted by flames and lay on
its roof down a slope off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway.
   ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is great,'' has become a battle cry of
the nearly 19-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the incident ``a shocking
disaster, the fruit of a disgusting mind, hate-filled. We have
reached the height of madness, a product of flowing hatred
(engendered) by endless incitement.''
   ``It doesn't matter much if this is a result of an organized plan
or a result of the atmosphere some groups create,'' he said on army
radio. ``I think we will find a way to take care of incidents like
this.''
   An Arab passenger believed to have grabbed the steering wheel was
arrested. He was at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, where director
Avi Israeli said he was treated for head and chest injuries.
   Police said the man would be questioned about his motive after he
recovered. They said he was from the occupied territories but was
not carryng an identification card.
   A reporter saw rescuers remove 17 body bags from the bus scene,
but it was uncertain if they contained full or partial remains.
   Other bags containing victims' belongings also were brought out
of the ravine, including glasses, shoes, canteens, a purse and
wallets, and a Book of Psalms.
   At least five of the injured were Americans, officials at
Hadassah Hospital said. They did not identify the American victims
by name.
   It was the worst such incident since March 11, 1978, when
Palestinian guerrillas from the PLO's Fatah faction infiltrated
Israel from the sea and hijacked a bus on the coastal highway.
Thirty-three people were killed and 82 were wounded.
   Angry Israelis called a popular radio talk show and demanded the
death penalty for terrorists.
   The bus driver, interviewed from his hospital bed on army radio,
said a bearded Arab man of about 25 approached him suddenly and
grabbed the wheel.
   ``I thought he wanted to ask me something, like everybody does on
the way. But he jumped on the steering wheel, shouted ``Allahu
Akbar'' and pulled it with all his strength to the right,'' said the
driver, Moshe Elul.
   Elul said he tried with all his strength to turn the wheel back
to the left ``but he simply sat down and put his legs on the front
dashboard to give him support, and that's how he dragged us down.''
   ``I woke up when the bus started to turn really sharply to the
right,'' said Victor Assal, 23, of Bethesda, Md. ``I saw people
screaming up front. All of a sudden the ground turned 90 degrees.
The first thing I did was grab for my gun. Then I lost
consciousness.''
   Assal, who emigrated to Israel last year and now serves in the
army, said he was on his way to visit his mother in Jerusalem when
the bus overturned.
   Today's crash occurred at 11:40 a.m. The red-and-white bus of the
state-run Egged company, one of many that makes the 45-minute run
between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem daily, broke through a steel barrier
on a straight section of the four-lane highway near this Israeli
Arab village, about seven miles west of Jerusalem.
   Witnesses said the bus, which seats about 50 people, was full.
The number of passengers could be higher, however, since people
often stand on the ride.
   A witness identified only as Reuven said on Israel radio that he
pulled the driver from the bus and the driver said: ``How did he do
this to me?''
   An army rescue team was brought in, and dozens of motorists left
their vehicles to climb into the ravine and recover victims, some
scaling down on ropes. Orthodox students in black hats and long
coats rushed from a nearby Jewish seminary to help.
   ``I ran across the road and saw bodies strewn all down the
ravine,'' said Yitzhak Cohen, 44, a businessman who was driving past
when the crash occurred.
   He said he heard a young female soldier in the bus screaming,
``Save me, save me!,'' and he helped her crawl out of the bus
through a window.
   It was unclear how quickly the bus caught fire. The gutted
vehicle was resting on its roof at the ravine's bottom, and army
teams brought by helicopter were assisting in the rescue.
   Injured victims were being taken out of the ravine by small Huey
helicopters and transferred to a larger CH-53 chopper that landed on
the roadway. They were being evacuated to hospitals.
   Police roped off the roadway, but traffic was being rerouted on a
side road through Abu Ghosh.
   Daniel Mordechai, a 48-year-old carpenter from Ramle, said he
arrived moments after it happened.
   ``At first there was a small fire like a camp fire. Then there
was a huge explosion. We didn't want to get too close to the bus
because we were afraid of getting hurt. So we helped those who were
blown out of the bus,'' he said.
   The crash came five weeks after a lone Arab wielding a knife
fatally stabbed two elderly Jews and injured three in downtown
Jerusalem.
   The murderer, Nidal Zaloum, 22, of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, was sentenced in June to life in prison for the attack. He
had shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' when he attacked his victims,
witnesses said.

   Janos Kadar, who took power after the
Soviets crushed the 1956 revolt and steered Hungary through relative
prosperity until moderates forced him out during hard times, died
today. He was 77.
   Kadar's death came as the Supreme Court canceled all charges
against former Premier Imre Nagy and his associates who led the 1956
uprising and were executed under Kadar on charges of high treason.
   The decision signified Nagy's legal rehabilitation.
   Kadar, the communist who led Hungary for 32 years until last year
and who ultimately came to symbolize resistance to democratic
change, died this morning after ``a prolonged, grave illness'' the
state-run MTI news agency said.
   The agency said the ruling Communist Party had ``with profound
sorrow'' informed its members and the Hungarian people of
``comrade'' Kadar's death.
   MTI said funeral arrangements would be announced later. It was
considered unlikely he would be buried before President Bush's visit
next week.
   Hungarian television broadcast a half-hour documentary on his
life this morning, and two Budapest radio stations canceled all
programming containing rock 'n' roll music and light entertainment.
   Kadar was hospitalized Monday with pneumonia and severe breathing
and circulatory problems.
   He was first reported gravely ill in April and in May lost his
post as honorary party chairman as well as a seat on the party's
Central Committee, which wrote him a letter criticizing mistakes
during his lengthy rule.
   Since he was replaced by Karoly Grosz in May 1988 as party
general secretary, Kadar's political legacy has come under fierce
attack and the communists have moved rapidly to embrace democratic
change, promising contested elections and a multiparty system.
   After guiding Hungary in the 1970's to relative prosperity and
freedom dubbed ``goulash communism'' in the West, Kadar came to be
seen as an impediment to further reform in the 1980s.
   He will perhaps be most remembered for his 1962 statement to a
rally in the industrial town of Csepel: ``Those who are not against
us are with us.''
   By the mid-1980s, Hungary's economy was in a tailspin and the
Soviet Union was undergoing a political rebirth under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Kadar fell out of favor in ruling circles.
   In a published response May 10 that MTI said was Kadar's last
public statement, the former leader admitted ``mistakes'' but said:
``My actions were guided by good intentions.''
   In apparent reference to the 1958 execution of Nagy and hundreds
of others after the 1956 revolt, Kadar said in the letter, ``I hope
... that future generations will assess more objectively the results
and errors of the past 30 years.''
   Nagy's remains, initially placed in an unmarked grave, were
reburied in a government-sanctioned ceremony June 16 that drew
hundreds of thousands of mourners marked his de facto political
rehabilitation.
   Kadar's change in fortunes was typical of a long career that
began in 1931 when he joined the illegal Communist Party as a
19-year-old from a peasant background, with only eight years of
schooling.
   Kadar was jailed and seemingly forgotten after a party purge in
1951 but was rehabilitated after the downfall of his Stalinist
rival, Matyas Rakosi.
   While in power, Kadar was conciliatory and ruthless by turns.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in 1965, he made a
prophetic comment: ``You have strummed a string to the effect that,
when the monolithic unity of the Communist countries is ended, what
is left?''
   Kadar was born May 26, 1912, in the Adriatic port of Fiume, which
was renamed Rijeka and became part of Yugoslavia when the
Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up.
   He advanced through Communist Party ranks to Central Committee
membership in May 1942, having spent more than three years in prison
on various political charges.
   After the communist takeover in 1948, Kadar became interior
minister in Rakosi's Stalinist regime but it was never clear whether
he controlled the feared political police.
   Rakosi kept a jealous eye on Kadar's progress and had him
arrested in 1951 on charges of espionage and treason. When Stalin
died in 1953, Rakosi's grip on power began to slip. Kadar was freed
and rehabilitated the next year.
   Growing discontent led to Rakosi's ouster in July 1956, but
dissatisfaction continued and a popular uprising began within three
months. Tens of thousands of students filled the streets, demanding
a free press, withdrawal of Soviet troops and a multiparty politics.
   Kadar became party leader a few days later, left the capital and
announced that he had established a rival government to that of
Premier Nagy.
   On Nov. 3, he asked the Kremlin to help end the revolt.
   Red Army forces moved in and Kadar instituted two years of
repression. Nagy and his associates were executed in June 1958.
   Less than four months after Nagy's death, Kadar embarked on
economic reform that brought growing prosperity and increasingly
cordial ties with the West.
   A reticent man who liked chess and reading, Kadar has been
described as a ``sad, ascetic man'' with ``an intense face.'' A
dedicated hunter, he told The AP hunting trips with Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev ``were no diplomatic pretexts for me.''
   ``If you enter a wood even as much as a meter, speech stops,'' he
said. ``You don't make a noise. You don't talk in the woods. There
is silence. That is why I like it.''
   Kadar played a shadowy role in the short-lived Czechoslovak
liberalization of 1968. It was said that he opposed intervention in
Czechoslovakia, but Hungarian soldiers joined the Soviet-led
invasion.
   His reforms in the 1970's foreshadowed the modernization
Gorbachev now is pursuing in the Soviet Union: less central
planning, more competition and weeding out or streamlining of
unprofitable state concerns.
   Economic problems increased, however. By the late 1980's,
inflation was 18 percent and the foreign debt $18 billion, the
highest per capita in the Soviet bloc. Large price increases and
other austerity measures fed discontent and the perception that
Kadar was largely to blame.
   Eight months after Grosz replaced Kadar, parliament legalized
independent political movements.
   And this year, the party decided the 1956 revolt was a popular
uprising, not the counterrevolution it had been called for 33 years.
On June 16, Nagy's remains were reburied with honor.
   In a serialized interview with the weekly Magyarorszag, Kadar
said: ``Nagy's tragedy is my own personal tragedy as well.''
   He is survived by his wife, Maria.

   The Arab League today declared that Israel's
plan for elections in the occupied territories was dead and urged
the United States to abandon support for the initiative.
   The league's envoy, Clovis Maksoud, said he would meet Friday
with State Department officials and ask the United States to support
the convening of an international conference to bring about peace
talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
   Maksoud said at a news conference that the decision by Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accede to demands by his hard-line
supporters had rendered useless his proposal for elections among the
1.7 million Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
   The Shamir plan ``was devised as a public relations gimmick to
defuse public outrage against Israel's inhuman and illegal
measures'' in crushing the 18-month Palestinian uprising, Maksoud
said.
   ``I hope the U.S. administration is sufficiently jolted by this
rude rebuke of its support for its protege to undertake a
long-overdue and profound reassessment'' of its support for the
Shamir plan.
   The next step should be for the United States to ``remove its
protective shield'' from the Shamir government and join European
countries and the Soviet Union in supporting an international peace
conference.
   Maksoud said he hopes President Bush's upcoming trip to Europe
will ``sensitize him to the support of U.S. allies for an
international conference and make him more willing to distance
himself from the intransigent excesses of Israel.''
   Shamir's election plan should now be turned into a referendum
among Israelis to determine whether a majority supports the
right-wing prime minister, Maksoud said.
   The envoy also said an attack Thursday by an Arab who plunged an
Israeli bus into a ravine reportedly killing 14 people ``was
testimony to the exasperation'' of Palestinians living under Israeli
occupation.
   Maksoud said that while such acts are not authorized by the
leadership of the Palestinian uprising and ``are not to be condoned,
at times they have to be understood.''

   American scientists proclaimed success today in a
pioneering experiment to detect the presence of a nuclear warhead
aboard a Soviet warship in the Black Sea.
   The success of the experiment, if confirmed by other scientists,
could bolster Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's argument that
it is possible to verify the presence of nuclear weapons aboard
ships and submarines.
   ``It was very successful,'' said Tom Cochran, an American
physicist with the Natural Resource Defense Council, a liberal
Washington group that organized the experiment with the Soviet state
Academy of Sciences.
   But it remains possible for either side to hide weapons or shield
them against detection by the type of devices used Wednesday,
Cochran said.
   Washington has balked at Soviet demands that the proposed
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which would cut superpower atomic
arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent, include a curb on
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles aboard submarines.
   U.S. Navy officers say they will not allow Soviets aboard
American submarines to conduct the intrusive inspections needed to
determine whether a cruise missile is carrying a conventional or
nuclear warhead.
   Soviet technology lags far behind American in the sophisticated
missiles, which can be launched very close to an enemy's shore, can
fly at altitudes too low for radar detection and deliver a nuclear
punch without warning against key coastal areas.
   In Wednesday's Black Sea experiment, Soviet government and
private American scientists used a variety of radiation detection
devices to measure the emission of neutrons and gamma rays from a
nuclear wearhead on an SS-N-12 subsonic cruise missile aboard the
Soviet missile cruiser Slava.
   Among observers were three American congressmen, all Democrats:
Reps. John Spratt, a member of the House Armed Services Committee
from South Carolina, Bob Carr, from Michigan, and James Olin, of
Virginia. They were in Yalta, 750 miles south of Moscow and not
available for comment immediately.
   Cochran and other American scientists from Princeton and Stanford
universities made their measurements with portable detectors placed
alongside the deck launcher, less than a yard from the warhead.
   Simultaneously, Soviet scientists from the academy's institutes
of geochemistry and earth physics used radiation detection devices
carried in a military helicopter and a troop transport, said Cochran.
   ``All the systems tested successfully,'' Cochran said in a
telephone interview.
   ``We detected the signature of the nuclear warhead in the
launcher'' he said. ``We used a portable germanium detector that we
placed alongside the launcher and got a strong signal from the U-235
and the plutonium in the warhead.'' Plutonium and U-232, a form of
uranium, are two main elements used in nuclear weapons.
   At the same time, Soviet scientists circling in a helicopter 65
yards above the Slava used a neutron detector that indicated the
presence of plutonium on the ship.
   Soviet scientists aboard a troop transport circling 70 yards from
the cruiser used a sodium iodide gamma ray detector that registered
radiation from the warhead, said Cochran.
   ``None of the tools by themselves is adequate to verify limits on
nuclear weapons, so you have to put together a package to cover the
shortcomings of various systems'' he said.
   Cochran said the scientists want to do a similar experiment in
the United States, but the American Navy has refused to cooperate.

   The conservative mayor of Beijing condemned recent
activism by China's intellectuals and hinted at the beginning of a
far-reaching purge of the educated elite.
   Mayor Chen Xitong also leveled more accusations at ousted
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, charging that Zhao ``connived''
to promote the political turmoil that climaxed with the massacre at
Tiananmen Square last month.
   Mayor Chen made his comments Friday in a speech to the National
People's Congress, China's legislature. The official Xinhua News
Agency released the text of the speech today.
   Also today, the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily
expressed outrage at recent moves to impose additional sanctions on
China by members of the U.S. Congress who ``sanctimoniously claim to
be the guardians of `human rights.'''
   Chen said that in September, certain Hong Kong newspapers and
journals began boosting Zhao and debunking senior leader Deng
Xiaoping.
   ``The essence of the dialogue was to whip up public opinion for
covering up Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, keeping his position and power
and pushing on bourgeois liberalization even more unbridledly,''
Chen said.
   He attacked a series of forums, speeches and open letters
organized since December by intellectuals including dissident Fang
Lizhi, who took refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing after the
military crackdown, and magazine editor Ge Yang and ideologist Su
Shaozhi, who gathered to discuss political questions.
   Some of the intellectuals Chen named are known to have escaped
China or gone underground in the last month, while others have been
arrested. By naming individual intellectuals and describing their
activities in detail, Chen's speech appeared to signal a widening
purge of intellectuals.
   ``Zhao all along tolerated and connived at the increasingly
evident signs of turmoil...thus facilitating the formation and
development of the turmoil,'' Chen said.
   He said that other party leaders had urged that Zhao call a
meeting April 23 of the party's top body, the Standing Committee of
the Politburo, but that ``instead of accepting this suggestion, Zhao
went golfing, as if nothing had happened.''
   ``Because he took such an attitude, the party and the government
lost a chance to stop the turmoil.''
   Zhao was sacked after being accused of trying to split the party
and supporting the student-led demonstrators.
   He has been stripped of his party and government posts, but
Chen's occasional reference to him as ``comrade'' and similar
references in the official press indicate he retains his party
membership.
   Chen also repeated government charges of foreign influence in the
demonstrations, saying: ``Political forces outside the Chinese
mainland and in foreign countries had a hand in the turmoil from the
very beginning.''
   China's Foreign Ministry today rejected a U.S. Embassy protest
over an army attack last month on diplomatic housing. Xinhua said
the ministry called ``groundless'' the embassy's charge that the
attack was premeditated and targeted certain apartments, including
those of American diplomats.
   The Chinese government also expressed indignation at recent moves
to impose sanctions against Beijing by members of the U.S. Congress.
   The House of Representatives voted June 29 to suspend trade and
development programs, prohibit sale of police equipment and suspend
transfers of nuclear technology. The Senate has yet to act on the
bill.
   ``To those people in the American Congress who deliberately
distort the fact and interfere with China's internal affairs, we
cannot but express our indignation,'' said the People's Daily.
   Troops armed with semi-automatic rifles and backed by tanks
fought their way to Tiananmen Square June 3-4, leaving nearly 300
dead according to Chinese government estimates. Western and private
Chinese estimates say as many as 3,000 people died.
   ``Any sovereign country would use the same legal and reasonable
methods when faced with a situation of this magnitude,'' the
People's Daily said.
   The Liberation Daily, Shanghai's Communist Party newspaper, said
the United States also has used force against student protesters,
noting that the National Guard shot to death four anti-Vietnam War
protesters at Kent State University in 1970.
   Chinese media have concentrated on attacking the United States,
although other Western governments have voiced strong criticism of
China's military action and imposed sanctions as well.
   Beijing especially has singled out the U.S. government-run Voice
of America radio network, which has an estimated audience in China
of tens of millions. The government last month expelled a VOA
correspondent, accusing him of making false reports and violating
martial law.

   With garbage piling up on the
streets, the mayor of this debt-ridden city wants the National Guard
called out to clean up the mess.
   But a spokesman for Gov. James R. Thompson said that's not likely
to happen.
   East St. Louis has had only sporadic garbage pickup for months.
Mayor Carl E. Officer said the desperately poor Mississippi River
city of 55,000 cannot afford to pay its garbage collector.
   ``Several years ago, the National Guard came into East St. Louis
and assisted us on a cleanup,'' Officer said Wednesday. He said he
expected ``a positive response'' from Thompson on sending the Guard
into East St. Louis.
   But David Fields, a spokesman for Thompson, said that is not an
appropriate use of soldiers, and Guard spokesman Maj. Bob Arnett
said the National Guard has never been called for garbage duty in
East St. Louis.
   ``You can't send the National Guard to every city that needs its
garbage picked up,'' Fields said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Cancels Charges Against Nagy and Associates</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Obit-Kadar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's Supreme Court today canceled
all charges against Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956 anti-Stalinist
uprising.
   The move by the Supreme Court meant full legal rehabilitation for
Nagy and eight associates, two of whom are still alive. Shortly
before he died, Nagy predicted he would one day be exonerated.
   ``The Supreme Court has found the chief prosecutor's petition
well-founded and canceled the sentences against Nagy and his
associates passed in 1958,'' the official MTI news agency reported.
   ``All of the charges were canceled as no crime was committed,''
it said.
   Nagy's daughter Erzsebet and relatives of other executed leaders
attended today's proceedings. Miklos Vasarhelyi and Sandor Kopacsi,
surviving Nagy aides included in the Supreme Court decision, did not.
   Nagy's legal rehabilitation came just hours after the government
announced the death of leader Janos Kadar, under whose regime Nagy
was executed after Soviet tanks crushed the revolt.
   Nagy was sentenced to death and was hanged June 16, 1958. His
body and those of his associates were dumped in unmarked graves in a
Budapest cemetery.
   A government-sanctioned reburial ceremony on the 31st anniversary
of his execution this year marked his de facto political
rehabilitation. Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians attended a
ceremony on the day of the reburial.
   The Hungarian Communist Party leadership issued a statement on
May 31, hailing Nagy as a symbol of communist reform and a
``significant figure'' in postwar history, and said he was sentenced
in a ``show trial'' that was in violation of the law.
   Prosecutor Karoly Szijarto lodged the 69-page petition with the
Supreme Court June 9, proposing that ``the illegal sentences be
revoked and the innocent people who were condemned be acquitted.''
   In an eight-point statement, Szijarto charged that authorities
``gravely and repeatedly violated the rules of criminal procedure in
effect at the time, particularly by limiting the freedom of the
accused and their right to defense.''
   Nagy was charged with high treason, setting up a secret
organization to overthrow the ``political system of people's
democrary'' and with aiming to restore the multiparty system.
   Hungary's communist leaders last month began landmark
negotiations with opposition groups on holding the first multiparty
elections since the communists consolidated power in 1948.
   Deputy chief prosecutor Sandor Nyiri told the court today that
Nagy was not guilty of treason.
   At his trial, Nagy reportedly said: ``I am convinced that the
Hungarian people and the international working class will exonerate
me. The time will come when the truth will be known.''

<HEAD>Crack on 727 Prompts Inspection of Jetliners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 20-inch crack found in an aging United Airlines
jet prompted the government to order immediate inspections of the
nation's oldest Boeing 727s.
   United mechanics at Stapleton International Airport located the
crack June 26 during a routine inspection of the 25-year-old plane.
   In a directive issued Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration
ordered the owners of 46 other Boeing 727-100 jets built in 1963 and
1964 to inspect them within two weeks and report any problems.
   The directive was made by telegram, a method used in cases
considered urgent. The FAA noted that cracks in the fuselage skin
could lead to rapid decompression of the plane.
   The 727, no longer manufactured, was the all-time best-selling
commercial jet before being supplanted by the Boeing 737. Tom Cole
of Boeing said there are 1,765 727s in service.
   Inspections were ordered only for the 47 oldest 727s because the
skin was made thicker on later models, Cole said. He said he did not
know which airlines were affected but that most of the first 47
planes went to U.S. carriers.
   Structural problems in older aircraft usually can be anticipated,
often through computers, but the one in the United jet was in an
unexpected place, Cole said. The crack was below the passenger
windows and between the front edge of the wing and the cabin door.
   The jet, one of the oldest in United's fleet, was repaired and
resumed flying, said FAA spokesman David Duff.
   A tear in an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 in Hawaii last year
crippled the jet and swept one flight attendant to her death.
Earlier this year, a fuselage tear in the oldest Boeing 747 in
United's fleet swept nine passengers to their deaths over Hawaii. A
faulty cargo door is thought to have caused the accident.
   The inspection order isn't expected to affect scheduling.

<HEAD>Thousands of Tremors Strike Central Japan for 7th Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of tremors struck an area southwest of the
capital today, the seventh day of quakes that have burst water pipes
and shaken the tiles off roofs in a seaside tourist town, officials
said.
   The Meteorological Agency said 2,506 tremors, including a quake
measuring 4.3 on the Richter scale and 66 others felt by citizens,
were recorded off the peninsula in the first 20 hours of the day.
   They brought to 11,286 the number of tremors reported in the area
since Friday. They were focused at depths of 2.5 to 3.1 miles under
the seabed and about four miles northwest of Ito, a seaside town 60
miles southwest of Tokyo, the agency said. Police said no casualties
or significant damage were reported.
   In Ito, four cases of burst water pipes, 14 cases of roof tiles
or stones falling off buildings or walls, and some ground cracks
were reported, said Setsuo Koizumi, a city official.
   Quakes on Wednesday included one measuring 4.9 on the Richter
scale that also caused some minor damage, officials said.
   A 13-member subcommittee of the government's Coordinating
Committee for Earthquake Prediction, met in an emergency session
Wednesday and called for a close watch to determine the potential
for a major earthquake.
   ``The tremors are believed to have been caused by magma movements
in the volcanic activity developing undersea off the peninsula since
the fall of 1978. The seismic levels in the current series of
tremors are considerably strong when compared to the previous ones
reported in the same area almost every year during the past
decade,'' said Kiyoo Mogi, a University of Tokyo professor who heads
the subcommittee.
   Mogi said in a telephone interview that in the same general area,
nearly 17,000 tremors, including some 290 felt by citizens, occurred
over a one-month period that began in late July last year.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter. An earthquake of 5 is capable of causing considerable
damage in populated areas.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
newly announced hard-line conditions for dealing with the
Palestinians have closed the door to peace, PLO spokesman Ahmed
Abdul-Rahman said today.
   He said the nearly 19-month-old uprising of Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would be ``escalated
because this is the only answer to intransigence.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman said Shamir had
also ``closed the door in the face'' of President Bush and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III, ``the only ones working for peace.
   ``These efforts now face total failure,'' he said.
   In Washington, the Arab League declared Israel's election plan
dead and urged the United States to abandon support for the
initiative.
   Clovis Maksoud, the league's envoy, said he would meet Friday
with State Department officials and ask Washington to support the
convening of an international conference to bring about peace talks
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
   ``I hope the U.S. administration is sufficiently jolted by this
rude rebuke of its support for its protege to undertake a
long-overdue and profound reassessment'' of its support for the
Shamir plan, Maksoud said.
   In a speech Wednesday, Shamir ruled out several peace options
considered to be attractive to the Palestinians.
   He said elections in the occupied territories for Palestinians
who would then negotiate with Israel on autonomy could be held only
after the uprising had been crushed.
   He also said Palestinian Arabs living in East Jerusalem would not
be allowed to vote in any elections and vowed to continue building
settlements in the territories.
   Shamir's new tough stance subdued a challenge to his leadership
of the right-wing Likud bloc.
   Abdul-Rahman said Shamir's speech had ``endangered'' the chances
for peace. ``There is a complete rejection of American and
Palestinian efforts to bring about peace.''
   He said the Palestinian leadership would meet within the next few
days to consider their position in the light of Shamir's speech.
   ``We will be contacting the American side to hear what they are
going to do,'' Abdul-Rahman said.
   He also said the Palestinians would ask the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council to take steps to convene an
international conference on the Middle East ``now that Shamir has
blocked the American initiative which was the only initiative going
and which had Soviet support.''

   Authorities have arrested a Lebanese
student on suspicion of plotting to bomb Israeli and American
targets in West Germany, law enforcement officials said today.
   Erwin Hoesl, an investigator for the Bavarian Criminal Office in
Munich, said the 21-year-old suspect is a ``fanatical'' Shiite
Moslem and that investigators uncovered the alleged plot ``just in
time'' before any attacks could be carried out.
   According to Hoesl, the suspect was apparently under contract
with Arab terrorist organizations in the Middle East. He was
arrested June 22 in a raid on his apartment in Darmstadt, 20 miles
south of Frankfurt. Many American military facilities are located in
both cities.
   Bavarian authorities declined to reveal the suspect's name but
said he has been a physics student at Darmstadt Technical University.
   The Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, however,
reported the suspect's first name and the first letter of his last
name, Bassan M.
   It said he has lived in Darmstadt since 1985 and that
investigators found instructions for making a bomb in his apartment.
   Police said no explosives were found.
   An earlier Bavarian police statement said the June 22 raid on the
student's apartment turned up evidence that bombing attacks were
planned on certain Israeli and American targets, which it did not
identify.
   Police said documents were found ``that indicate he scouted out
Israeli and American establishments for Middle East contractors''
for possible bombing attacks.
   The newspaper report said the suspect was allegedly helping to
set up ``imminent'' bombing attacks in Munich, 180 miles southeast
of Darmstadt, on the office of Israel's airline, El Al; the Israeli
Trade Center; and the city's Jewish community center.
   The newspaper added that ``an English-language list of Israeli
and Jewish religious establishments in the Federal Republic (West
Germany)'' were found during the raid in Darmstadt.
   The paper said the ``contractors are not in this country and
therefore not reachable by German police.'' Bavarian police declined
to say who had hired the suspect.
   Authorities in September 1988 intercepted several photos that
were to be sent to Beirut showing Israeli offices in Munich and
accompanied by an Arab-language text, officials said.
   ``After months of work in cooperation with Hesse state police,
Bavarian authorities were able to identify the suspect,'' the
statement added.

<HEAD>`The Red Sneaks,' A New Musical by Elizabeth Swados, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City streets have gotten a little meaner and a
lot more dangerous in the 11 years since Elizabeth Swados put a
group of young people on stage in ``Runaways,'' a musical collage
about kids who ran away from home.
   For ``The Red Sneaks,'' now on view at off-Broadway's Perry
Street Theater, Miss Swados again looks at the material seductions
available to the lost children of the big city.
   Her vision is remarkably clear, unsentimental and disturbing,
three qualities you wouldn't expect in a musical loosely based on
``The Red Shoes,'' that Faustian tale of a ballerina's obsession
with dance. But in collaboration with her young performers, she has
put together a gritty little contemporary musical that combines pop
and rock with more traditional musical comedy.
   Her score, augmented by two rap songs written by several of the
actors in the show, ranks among the best work she has done. One
number, ``Sad and Lonely Child,'' is particularly affecting.
   In this 70-minute version, Dedre, a young resident of a New York
welfare hotel, sells her soul for the red sneakers, a magical pair
of shoes dusted with red glitter. She is seduced by Shawn, a
devilish young man who raps his way into her heart.
   Their tale is amplified by a chorus of six other youngsters,
children who sing their way through a long list of urban victims and
social ills. ``Stupid macho junkie boy'' and ``stupid little babies
filled with babies'' go two of their topical chants.
   These kids know the consequences of their actions but that
doesn't stop them from experimenting with sex and drugs. Their world
is shaped by the glamour of television and film. What they see on a
screen is what they want and will do anything to get.
   Dedre Guevara is fine, even touching, as the doomed heroine
seduced by Shawn Benjamin, a strutting, street-wise Satan. They get
strong support from the other cast members, particularly Kenny Lund
who matter-of-factly reduces kiddie porn and the selling of crack to
a question of economics.
   The choreography by Arthur Fredric is mostly of the enthusiastic,
foot-stomping variety, but it works on G.W. Mercier's set of a
decaying tenement. Miss Swados, who also directed, moves her young
charges around the small stage with style and speed.
   ``The Red Sneaks'' is contemporary musical theater at its best, a
morality tale that doesn't preach but still manages to deliver a
message with its often compelling entertainment.

<TEXT>
   A new municipal ordinance recognizing
unmarried couples _ gay or heterosexual _ appeared headed for the
November ballot after two clergymen turned in more than 27,000
signatures for repeal.
   Registrar Germaine Wong said 18,000 signatures are needed to get
the measure on the ballot. She said it will take at least five days
to verify the signatures.
   The ordinance, which was passed last month and took effect
Wednesday, permits unmarried couples to register their partnerships
at City Hall for a $35 fee.
   The ordinance grants visitation rights to partners of hospital
patients, and bereavement leave for city employees whose partners
die. A task force is considering whether the ordinance also entitles
unmarried partners of city employees to full health coverage.
   In their petition, opponents of the measure said it ``abitrarily
redefined the time-honored and hallowed nature of the family, flying
therewith in the face of some of society's most precious values.''
   The petition for a repeal vote was submitted by the Rev. Charles
McIlhenny, a pastor at the First Orthodox Presbyterian Church, and
Rabbi Lionel Feldman. The petition drive also was backed by several
Roman Catholic parishes.
   Both men refused to comment when they dropped off a box full of
signatures at the city clerk's office Wednesday.
   The action drew a sharp response from supporters of the ordinance.
   ``If the right wing wants to put something on the ballot, they
can go ahead,'' said Jean Harris, aide to city Supervisor Harry
Britt, author of the measure. ``We have 60 percent of the people in
San Francisco backing us.''
   San Francisco expects about 900 couples annually to register as
``domestic partners.''
   There was no fanfare Wednesday to mark the new law, in part
because sign-up forms and explanatory brochures were not ready.
People who showed up to enroll were turned away, but officials said
the forms should be ready today.
   The real kickoff will probably take place in August to allow gay
organizations time to round up couples to take part in a mass
signup, Harris said.

<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today
that his Labor Party is considering pulling out of the government to
protest the tough new conditions Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir put
on his peace initiative.
   Three left-wing parties filed no-confidence motions against the
government in Parliament, claiming the decision Wednesday by
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc had foiled chances of starting peace
talks.
   Ministers of the center-left Labor Party convened a special
meeting at party headquarters in Tel Aviv, but it was postponed
after an Israeli bus drove into a ravine, killing more than a dozen
people. Police said the accident occurred when a Palestinian
passenger grabbed the bus' steering wheel.
   Avi Gil, a spokesman for Labor leader and Finance Minister Shimon
Peres, said the party's 100-member bureau would convene Monday to
decide what course of action to take.
   Shamir sought to soften his party's decision by announcing plans
to ``do the utmost'' to find Palestinians as partners for Middle
East peace talks.
   ``What Likud decided was about implementation of the plan, not to
prevent talks, contacts or discussions with Palestinians to put this
thing on track,'' said Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner.
   The peace plan, introduced earlier this year by Rabin and later
adopted by Shamir, called for Palestinians in the occupied
territories to elect representatives to talks with Israel on an
autonomy plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Later negotiations
would decide the territory's final status.
   In response to pressures by Likud hard-liners led by Industry
Minister Ariel Sharon, Shamir on Wednesday ruled out several peace
options considered attractive to Palestinians.
   The party adopted them as a policy, but Shamir aides insisted
this did not affect the formal elections proposal.
   Shamir explicitly ruled out a chief condition of Palestinians,
the participation of 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem in the
elections.
   He also rejected establishment of a Palestinian state and said
the balloting could not be held until the nearly 19-month
Palestinian uprising ended. The revolt has claimed the lives of 543
Arabs and 23 Israelis.
   ``What the Likud has embraced, first of all, is neutralizing
chances of getting the peace initiative off the ground,'' Rabin said
on Israel radio.
   ``There are doubts about whether there will be room for a unity
government or definitely for Labor's participation,'' he added in a
separate interview with army radio.
   Four other prominent Labor ministers, including Peres, also
suggested Likud's decision meant they should consider leaving the
coalition government.
   Shamir responded to Labor's threats by telling the daily Maariv,
``I hope Labor will remain in the government. They have no reason to
change their position, but it is all up to them.''
   If Labor leaves the Cabinet, Shamir could be forced call new
national elections for lack of a sound base of support in the
120-member Parliament.
   But Israeli newspaper editorials made light of Labor's threats,
and analysts reasoned that both Peres and Rabin were not assured
victory if elections were held.
   The Hadashot newspaper said Israel's main problem now would be
expected U.S. displeasure with Shamir's statements: ``Shamir emerged
unscathed from the test he faced in Likud's Central Committee. The
American test is likely to be no easier, and maybe harder.''
   But Shamir's spokesman Pazner stressed that the premier's speech
Wednesday showed ``no change in his attitude about what should be
done'' to advance the peace process.
   ``What happened yesterday was a reiteration of Likud's position.
There was nothing new,'' Pazner added. ``We want to make clear that
we continue to be committed to the initiative and to do the utmost
to find partners.''
   The PLO, which already has criticized the elections plan for
failing to guarantee them a future independent state, said Shamir's
speech ``closed the door to peace.''
   In Tunis, PLO spokesman Ahmad Abdel Rahman also said the speech
``closed the door in the face of (President) Bush and (Secretary of
State) Baker, the only ones working for peace. These efforts now
face total failure.''
   In a related development, the Maariv daily said that before the
Likud meeting, the United States and PLO decided to upgrade the
level of the dialogue they renewed in December and were considering
moving the talks from Tunis to Cairo.
   Asked about the report, Pazner replied: ``We hear rumors about
the upgrade and we regret this very much.''

<HEAD>Top Court Says Homosexual Lovers Can Be Considered Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   New York's highest court ruled today that a
partner in a long-term homosexual relationship can take over the
couple's rent-controlled apartment when the lover who signed the
lease dies.
   In a 4-2 ruling, the Court of Appeals ordered a lower court to
reconsider its decision to evict a New York City man from a
rent-controlled apartment he shared for a decade with his now-dead
lover.
   In doing so, the court expanded the definition of a ``family'' as
it applies to New York's rent-control laws. The word is crucial
because state law says only ``family members'' may take over
rent-controlled apartments when the tenant of record dies.
   The court said that the definition should include adults who show
long-term financial and emotional commitment to each other, even if
they don't fit the traditional meaning of a ``family.''
   Today's decision is the first time any top state court in the
nation has recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent of a
family, according to American Civil Liberties Union lawyer William
Rubenstein, who argued the case.
   ``Today's decision is a ground-breaking victory for lesbian and
gay men,'' Rubenstein said. ``It marks the most important single
step forward in American law toward legal recognition of lesbian and
gay relationships.''
   The ruling comes amid growing fears within the gay community
about housing discrimination because of AIDS. It's especially
important in New York City, which has the greatest number of AIDS
cases in the nation and a tight housing market.
   Rubenstein said the ruling would also apply to unmarried
heterosexual partners and poor families who can't afford to
formalize their relationships.
   ``We conclude that the term family ... should not be rigidly
restricted to those people who have formalized their relationship by
obtaining, for instance, a marriage certificate or an adoption
order,'' Judge Vito Titone wrote.
   Furthermore, Titone said that state rent-control law protections
against sudden eviction ``should not rest on fictitious legal
distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find its
foundation in the reality of family life.''

<DATELINE>MINERAL POINT, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young man who pleaded no contest to
killing his adoptive parents and brother in 1983 collects money from
their estate for rent, living expenses and schooling because the
couple died without a will.
   An agreement recently made public shows that the man, who changed
his name from Peter Zimmer to Anton Jovan Collier, is the
beneficiary of a trust that pays for his apartment, gives him $100 a
week spending money and pays for college or vocational school.
   It requires him to attend school full time until 1992 or until he
earns a bachelor's degree, live in the apartment and not commit a
felony.
   The agreement, which Collier signed in 1987, bars him from
contacting Zimmer relatives or traveling to Wisconsin, Illinois,
Arizona or California. He forfeits the trust if he violates any
portion of the settlement.
   Collier, who was 14 when his parents and brother were slain in
1983, was sent to a juvenile institution after pleading no contest.
   Hans Zimmer, 48, was found shot to death in family's rural
Mineral Point home. His wife, Sally, 44, and son, Perry, 10, were
stabbed up to 20 times.
   Because Collier's parents had no will, the probate court
recognized him as sole heir of the $177,000 estate. He filed an
inheritance claim before being released from the detention home in
1987.
   Relatives contested his claim but later agreed to a settlement on
the condition it be kept confidential.
   But a state appeals court ruled that the settlement was public
information under Wisconsin law, and the agreement became public
last week.
   Collier's case was cited by lawmakers last year to win passage of
a law preventing juvenile killers from inheriting their victims'
estate.
   Collier's whereabouts were not disclosed.

   Excerpts from the speech by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday to the Council of Europe,
from an English-language translation provided to reporters:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On European unity:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A truly unique chance is opening (for Europeans) to play a role
in building a new world, one that would be worthy of their past, of
their economic and spiritual potential.
   It also is the specific feature of the situation in Europe that
it can cope with all this, live up to the expectations of its
peoples and do its international duty at the new state of world
history, only by recognizing its wholeness and by making the right
conclusions.
   Europe experienced more than once the attempts at unification by
force. But it also experienced noble dreams of a voluntary
democratic community of European peoples.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On Europe's different social systems:=
   The idea of European unification should be collectively thought
over once again ... I know that many people in the West perceive the
main difficulty in the existence of two social systems.
   Yet the difficulty lies elsewhere _ it lies in the rather
widespread belief, or in the political objective, that overcoming
the division of Europe means overcoming socialism.
   But this is a course for confrontation, if not something worse.
There will be no European unity along these lines. The fact that the
states of Europe belong to different social systems is a reality.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On the changing political order:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The social and political order in some particular countries did
change in the past, and it can change in the future as well. But
this is exclusively a matter for the peoples themselves and their
choice.
   Any interference in internal affairs, any attempts to limit the
sovereignty of states _ both friends and allies or anybody else _
are inadmissible.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On the defense of socialism:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   For all our present shortcomings and lagging behind, we know full
well the strong points of our social system which result from its
essential characteristics.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On outmoded stereotypes:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In the meantime, less true than in the past, it is precisely on
the basis of outmoded stereotypes that the Soviet Union continues to
be suspected of hegemonistic designs and of the intention to
decouple the United States from Europe.
   There are even some people who are willing to put the U.S.S.R.
outside of Europe.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On the superpowers:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and the United States are a natural part of the
European international and political structure.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On Europe's negative aspects:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Let us not forget that the metastases of colonial slavery spread
around the world from Europe. It was here that fascism came into
being. It was here that the most destructive wars started.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On a blueprint for a common European home:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   I do not claim to carry a finished blueprint of that home in my
pocket. What we have in mind is a restructuring of the international
order existing in Europe that would put common European values in
the forefront and make it possible to replace the traditional
balance of forces with a balance of interests.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On force:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The philosophy of the concept of a common European home rules out
any likelihood of an armed clash and the very possibility of the use
or threat of force.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On NATO:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   If it becomes clear that NATO countries are ready to join us in
negotiation on tactical nuclear weapons, we could, naturally in
consulting with our allies, carry out without delay further
unilateral reductions in our tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.
   The need to convene within the next 18 to 24 months a second
Helsinki-type meeting is coming to the fore with ever increasng
urgency.
   It is time for the present generation of leaders of the European
countries, U.S.A. and Canada to discuss, in addition to the most
immediate issues, how they contemplate future stages of progress
toward a European community of the 21st century.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On East-West cooperation:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The following projects, for example, are equally urgent both for
the East and West of Europe:
   _ A trans-European high-speed railway.
   _ A common European program on new solar-energy technologies and
equipment.
   _ Processing and storing nuclear waste and enhancing the safety
of nuclear power stations.
   _ Additional fiber optics channels for transmitting information.
   _ An all-European satellite TV system.
   _ An international thermonuclear experimental reactor.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On the European Economic Community:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   We are far from underestimating the emergence in the next few
years of a single European market ... coming up is a trade and
economic agreement between our country and the EC. We attach
substantial significance to this act.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On the environment:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The common European home will have to be environmentally clean
... major ecological problems have long ago transcended national
confines. Setting up a regional ecological security system is
therefore an urgent task ... elaborating a long-term continental
ecological program could be a first step.

<DATELINE>SPOLETO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian critics Thursday gave glowing
reviews to the world premiere of a stage version of Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's ``No One Writes to the Colonel.''
   The play was written and directed by an Argentine and interpreted
by a Venezuelan theater company.
   The debut Tuesday night was sold out despite torrential rains in
Spoleto, an Umbrian town north of Rome. ``Colonel'' is the only
foreign-language prose work in the 32nd annual Festival of Two
Worlds.
   A version of the festival is also held each year in Charleston,
S.C., and Melbourne, Australia.
   Argentine Carlos Gimenez and several collaborators wrote the
screenplay for ``Colonel'' in 1971. According to Italian newspapers,
the text was approved by Garcia Marquez. The cast is from the
Rajatabla Theater Company of Caracas.
   ``Gimenez's adaptation faithfully reflects the double nature,
realistic and symbolic, of Garcia Marquez's narrative,'' wrote Renzo
Tian of the Rome daily Il Messaggero.
   ``From this contrast expressed with intense simplicity, the play
acquires a vivid dramatic force ... this is animated by a group of
vigorous interpreters headed by Jose Tejera, who plays the taciturn
colonel, Aura Rivas, his bitter wife, and supporting roles by Daniel
Lopez, Annibal Grun, Mimi Sills and Erich Wildpret.''
   The 1961 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning Colombian writer tells
of a forgotten civil war hero in the imaginary Latin American town
of Macondo. The colonel waits in poverty and solitude for a pension
that will never come. His last possession of value is a prize
fighting cock, which he refuses to sell.
   The Spoleto festival runs through July 16 and includes operas,
dance, theater, music, art exhibits and films.

   A wildfire spread to a utility transmission line, blacking out a
sweltering Utah town, and a wind-whipped forest fire sent smoke
billowing 10,000 feet over the Utah-Colorado line, restricting air
travel.
   Major fires burned out of control in six states today.
   In New Mexico, the state's biggest blaze covered 6,500 acres and
40 fresh lightning fires popped up, including a 400-acre blaze that
threatened ranch buildings near the Arizona line.
   Dying winds and cool night weather helped firefighters battle
several brush fires burning on more than 4,000 acres in Southern
California.
   The blackout in Utah began Wednesday afternoon when a Utah Power
&amp; Light Co. maintenance truck caught fire. Flames spread to 70 acres
of grass and small trees, toppled four wooden transmission towers
and knocked out a 230,000-volt line.
   Electricity was restored to many communities within hours, but
the 20,000 residents of St. George, the state's hot spot Wednesday
with a high of 108 degrees, remained without power this morning.
   ``A lot of people have gone out of town, to Mesquite, Nevada, or
places where they have power, or to places in the mountains where
it's cooler,'' said Barbara Mathews of the Washington County
sheriff's office.
   Officials this morning said that the fire was contained and they
hoped to have it under control this afternoon.
   Four other fires raged out of control on more than 11,000 acres
in eastern Utah, where temperatures were around 100 degrees and
humidity levels below 5 percent.
   A 7,000-acre blaze roared past fire lines in the Flume Canyon
Wilderness Study Area 20 miles west of the Colorado line. It belched
so much smoke that the Federal Aviation Administration closed an air
route.
   The fire also burned over a natural gas pipeline and ignited gas
seeping from a small leak, but the operator managed to cut off the
flow in time to prevent any serious damage, said Dan Lewis, a
spokesman for Northwest Pipeline Co.
   Some 275 firefighters battled the fire with two tanker planes and
two helicopters, said Mary Plumb of the Bureau of Land Management.
Containment was expected this weekend, she said.
   A fire on more than 2,600 acres in Uinta Canyon moved to the
northeast despite aerial attacks by seven tankers and three
helicopters and ground assaults by 400 firefighters, said BLM
spokesman Ray Tate. ``It should burn for several days despite our
best efforts,'' he said.
   A third blaze 23 miles west of Duchesne, which was nearly
extinguished on Tuesday, roared out of control on more than 850
acres because of wind. A fourth fire in Indian Canyon between
Duchesne and Price covered 900 acres.
   In western Colorado, a grass fire scorched 900 acres and
destroyed a home before being declared 75 percent contained this
morning. Crews also nearly contained a stubborn fire that burned
2,100 acres near Dinosaur National Monument.
   In Southern California, 340 firefighters struggled against an
800-acre fire southeast of San Diego that cut off telephone service
to two small communities and threatened homes. Four firefighters
suffered minor injuries.
   ``What's giving us the most difficulty is that they can only
reach the fire with hand crews because the terrain is very steep,''
said California Department of Forestry spokeswoman Dolores Fremter.
   Three other blazes blackened more than 3,000 acres in Riverside
County. The largest burned 1,300 acres of brush near Lake Elsinore
before being contained this morning.
   A person loading abandoned cars onto a flatbed truck caused a
spark that started the fire, said Tim Spann of the Forestry
Department. ``That's how dry it is out here,'' he said.
   In New Mexico, about 1,000 firefighters and support workers
battled a fire that grew an additional 500 acres to 6,500 acres
Wednesday in Gila National Forest, said Forest Service spokesman
Mary Zabinski. Rain kept the fire from growing further this morning,
and containment was expected by Friday.
   But the storm also brought lightning that caused 25 new fires in
the Gila forest and 15 elsewhere in New Mexico. One fire spread over
400 acres and threatened ranch buildings on federal-owned Owl Canyon
near the Arizona line.
   More than 100 firefighters battled a lightning fire in Georgia
that has burned at least 750 acres of the Okefenokee Swamp. John
Hart, a Forest Service spokesman, said below-normal rainfall and
water levels hampered efforts to fight the blaze, which apparently
broke out late last week.
   More than 200 fresh firefighters were joining the battle today
against a 2,200-acre blaze in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National
Forest. Offficials said they were having trouble finding
firefighters.
   ``The availability of crews seems to be somewhat depleted, with
the number of fires in Colorado and so forth,'' said Ed Christian, a
spokesman for the forest. The fire started July Fourth, apparently
from fireworks.

<HEAD>Federal Inspectors, FBI Probe NY Nuclear Site For Waste Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents and a team of Energy Department
specialists experts today entered a federal nuclear fuel facility in
upstate New York to investigate possible violations of environmental
and safety rules, the department said.
   Dennis C. Vacco, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of
New York, said the FBI agents on the site, about 50 miles south of
Buffalo, were looking for evidence of possible criminal violations
of federal laws governing hazardous waste storage.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said the investigation was
the first of 17 such probes by Energy Department specialists over
the next year at federal nuclear facilities. The Energy Department
took over operation of the New York state-owned plant in 1980.
   Last month, FBI agents raided an Energy Department nuclear
weapons plants in Colorado in search of criminal violations of waste
storage laws. DOE employees were not allowed to participate in that
raid, and Moore said last week that the resulting bad publicity had
triggered a new effort to cooperate in such probes.
   Moore said ``there is currently no evidence'' of waste-handling
violations at the New York facility, known as the West Valley
Demonstration Project.
   Christina Sankey, a department spokeswoman, said the plant has
been operated since 1966 and currently is being decommissioned and
decontaminated. The facility, which reprocessed nuclear fuel for
power plants during the 1970s, contains an unspecified amount of
low-level, high-level and other categories of radioactive waste.
   Ms. Sankey said the investigation could last several weeks. She
said the Environmental Protection Agency also was participating in
the investigation.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins announced late last month that
he had created ``tiger teams'' of department specialists to assess
environmental compliance at all department nuclear facilities,
including the nuclear weapons plants.

<HEAD>New York Court Strips Prison Dads of Parental Rights</HEAD>

   New York's highest court ruled unanimously
today that prisoners serving long sentences can be stripped of their
parental rights if they fail to find a relative to care for their
children.
   ``Put simply, relegating a child to foster care until he or she
is no longer a child is not a viable plan ... and, more importantly,
it deprives the child of that quality of `permanency' found by the
Legislature to be so essential to proper growth and development,''
wrote Judge Fritz Alexander of the Court of Appeals.
   The 7-0 ruling means that Willie Bethea, serving two 25
years-to-life murder sentences, cannot block the adoption of his
13-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter. The ruling also affects
another inmate, identified in court papers only as Gregory F., and
his sons, ages 9 and 8. Gregory F. is serving 10-to-20 years for
armed robbery.
   In both cases, foster parents sought to adopt the children.
   ``I don't believe I lost,'' said Ruth Cassell, Bethea's lawyer.
``You're screwed if you're an inmate.''
   She said she had not yet read the decision or decided whether to
appeal.
   In 1983, the Legislature gave inmates a say in whether their
children could be adopted. Before that, they had no parental rights.
However, inmates were expected to maintain contact with their
children and plan for their futures.
   While the Court of Appeals noted that the Bethea and Gregory F.
had regularly visited with their children, it also said they had
been unable to find family members to care for the youngsters.

   Evangelicals, a growing force in Christianity, open a global
conference next week to refine strategies for spreading the faith,
some aiming for it to be offered to everyone by A.D. 2000.
   That widely asserted target sometimes is considered more as a
stimulus than a potentially accomplishable task. But the fervor for
working at it is mounting in many church quarters.
   ``The Countdown Has Begun'' goes the title on a book of
interdenominational planning discussions held early this year in
Singapore. But the mission's success was seen to require some course
corrections.
   ``We see afresh that cooperation and partnership are absolute
necessities if the Great Commission is going to be fufilled by the
year 2000,'' the participants said.
   Up to now, they said, ``pride, prejudice, competition and
disobedience have hindered our generation from effectively working
at the task of world evangelization.''
   The ``Great Commission'' refers to Christ's parting instructions
to present his message to all peoples. Evangelicals have a special
passion for proclaiming that message and eliciting belief in it.
   Advancing that task beyond any particular time frame is the
objective of the International Congress on World Evangelization,
which is meeting Tuesday through July 20 in Manila, the Philippines.
   Evangelist Billy Graham had been scheduled to give the opening
address, but canceled the Manila appearance in favor of extending
his ``Mission '89'' in London, his office said.
   More than 4,000 evangelical-minded Christians of both mainline,
historic churches and smaller evangelically oriented groups in 190
countries are expected to make the Philippines gathering one of the
largest of its kind.
   It has been dubbed ``Lausanne II,'' a successor to a similar
gathering in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974, which was convened by
Graham's organization and spawned a continuing, interlinked movement.
   The Rev. Leighton Ford of Charlotte, N.C., chairman of the
Lausanne committee taht is sponsoring the this year's congress, says
the session will address new, crucial issues that are affecting
evangelization.
   ``Secularism is rampant and we're suffering from a lack of
evangelical cohesion,'' he said.
   He said the meeting will ``bring together the many streams of
evangelism,'' examine ``new issues and challenges'' and ``plan
strategies for a great new thrust of evangelization in the closing
decade of this century.''
   Planners say participants are coming both from major Protestant
and Orthodox churches in the World Council of Churches and also
those outside it, plus some Roman Catholic evangelization
specialists.
   About 200 organizations have set the timeclock, at least
symbolically, on getting the Christian message spread worldwide by
the year 2000, but that is only one note in the more broadly
concerned Manila conference.
   While emphasizing evangelism and cooperation in it, the
conference also is to grapple with social issues such as poverty,
racism, urbanization and the challenge of other religions.
   It also may set up a central clearing house for coordination and
exchange of information in the findal-decade drives to present the
gospel to those who have not yet heard it.
   Already, an ``A.D. 2000 Global Service Office'' has been
established in Rockville, Va., for exchange of information,
coordination of publications and production of a newsletter.
   Mission researchers estimate about 1.3 billion of the world's 5
billion people have never heard the Christian message.
   The Rev. Thomas Wang, international director of the Lausanne
committee and chairman of the Singapore consultation, wrote in
Christianity Today:
   ``Around the world we have been hearing an international chorus
of Christian leaders crying out for a more concerted evangelistic
effort. It's as though God is saying, `Gentlemen, it's time to get
more serious.'''
   He said the Manila conference and the A.D. 2000 emphasis could
benefit each other ``like a two-stage rocket.''
   Besides the many organizations that have focused on the
end-of-century goal, including larger bodies such as the Southern
Baptists, various other organizations have pinpointed the final
decade for evangelistic emphasis.
   The ``Decade of Universal Evangelilzation,'' Roman Catholicism
calls it. The Assemblies of God calls it the ``Decade of Harvest.''
Presbyterians and the worldwide Anglican Communion calls it the
``Decade of Evangelism.'
   At the recent mission-evangelism conference sponsored by the
World Council of Churches in San Antonio, about 60 evangelical
participants appealed for better relations between it and the
Lausanne evangelism movement.
   Urging that the two world conferences be held jointly, they said
that acting separately strained resources and gave a divisive image
to the world.
   The Rev. Eugene Stockwell, a world council official, said at a
news conference that there is ``an impression abroad we are at odds
with one another.'' But, he added, ``what unites us in common
commitment to Jesus Christ is far more important than anything that
might be a difference among us.''

<HEAD>Repeal of Crime Victims Law Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Senate today voted without debate
to repeal a three-week-old law that lets police withhold crime
victims' names from the press and public. The 24-0 vote sent the
bill to the House.
   The law, which took effect June 14, created a storm of protest in
the news media.
   Republican John Leedom, the Senate sponsor of the law, also
sponsored the repeal. He said the law had been ``misapplied to such
an extent that many law enforcement officers are not furnishing
(information) _ that was not the intent.''
   The law amended the Texas Open Records Act to allow authorities
to withhold information that might identify victims of felonies such
as aggravated assault, robbery and murder.
   Supporters had said it would protect victims from being pestered
by alarm salesmen and security companies.
   As the uproar grew against the law, Gov. Bill Clements added
repeal to the agenda of the special legislative session.
   George Irish, publisher of the San Antonio Light and a
representative of a First Amendment and freedom-of-information
coalition of seven Texas news organizations, argued for repeal in
testimony submitted in writing.
   He said the law creates a ``potentially dangerous situation for
citizens far more devastating than the temporary harassment by
unscrupulous sales personnel.''
   ``Perhaps the most disturbing result of the law has been the
blackout of information disclosing the identity of the victim in a
child kidnapping case,'' Irish said. ``It is exactly the fact that
information is dispersed about a kidnapping which often leads to
solving the case.''

   Two bombs exploded Thursday hours before
the firing of the traditional midday rocket that marked the start of
the weeklong fiesta of the running of the bulls, police said.
   The bombs, which caused no injuries, wrecked the cars of two
politicians who belong to the Popular Union party, widely believed
to be the political arm of the Basque separatist group ETA, a police
spokesman said. No group claimed responsibility for the blast.
   Seven hours after the early morning explosions, thousands in the
city's main square cheered as officials fired off the traditional
rocket, or ``chupinazo,'' to start the annual San Fermin festival,
made famous by Ernest Hemingway in his 1926 novel, ``The Sun Also
Rises.''
   ETA, whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Liberty, has
killed more than 600 people since it began its violent campaign for
independence for the northern, three-province Basque region in 1968.
   Pamplona is the capital of the autonomous region of Navarre,
which borders the Basque region. ETA also seeks the annexation of
Navarre as an independent Basque state.
   The city's population of 200,000 was expected to double as
thousands of tourists arrive to partake in eight days of
around-the-clock festivities in honor of San Fermin, Pamplona's
patron saint.
   The fiesta revolves around the daily morning run of bulls from a
pen along a half-mile route to the city bull ring when hundreds of
people try to keep ahead of the six bulls and six steers that
accompany them.
   The runs begin Friday and continue through July 14. The six bulls
reappear later in the day at a bullfight.
   The festival has been held continuously since 1591. Since that
date, bulls have gored 52 people to death, 13 of them since 1924.
   This year, the city plans to spend $583,000 on the festival,
including $67,000 on fireworks.
   On Tuesday, suspected Basque separatists fired three
rocket-propelled grenades at a Pamplona barracks of the paramilitary
Civil Guard, slightly damaging the building but causing no injuries.
In 1985, an ETA bomb injured a policeman in Pamplona as the fiesta
was set to start.

<HEAD>No Abnormality Found in Seas Where Hydrogen Bomb Lost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   No abnormalities have been found in samples of fish
and seaweed taken from the area where a hydrogen bomb fell off a
U.S. aircraft carrier 24 years ago, the Science and Technology
Agency said Thursday.
   The findings were contained in a preliminary report. Agency
official Kimihiko Oda said the agency still was analyzing water
samples taken from the deep sea, and a final report would be
available by the end of July.
   He said samples were taken in the fishing grounds nearest to the
area where an A-4 Skyhawk plane carrying a one-megaton H-bomb
accidentally rolled off the carrier Ticonderoga on Dec. 5, 1965. The
bomb fell into the sea about 80 miles from a small island off
Okinawa, in southern Japan.
   Japan did not become aware of the accident until May, when it
began its tests.
   The agency also analyzed data from annual surveys taken in many
places in Japan and offshore for the past 21 years to check on
radioactive fallout from nuclear tests by China, the Soviet Union,
the United States and France, Oda said, and no abnormalities were
found.
   Still to be analyzed are water samples collected from a depth of
14,850 feet by a vessel of the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast
guard.
   Oda said no samples were taken from the 15,840-foot-deep seabed
where the bomb sank because the survey's aim was to find whether the
accident affected Japan's people and the marine environment.
   Last month, William Arkin of the Washington-based Institute for
Policy Studies, which released declassified U.S. Navy documents on
the accident, said there was little danger the bomb would detonate,
although the 33 pounds of plutonium it contained could threaten the
environment as it deteriorates.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today awarded the nation's
highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to Gen.
James H. Doolittle, public servants C. Douglas Dillon and George
Kennan, former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and comedian Lucille Ball.
   Miss Ball's award was accepted posthumously by her husband, Gary
Morton.
   Bush praised the five as American heroes.
   ``You have left an indelible mark as you have enriched this
nation, and America is grateful,'' he said.
   Doolittle, 92, the aviation pioneer and retired Air Force general
who made history by leading the first U.S. air strike on Japan
following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was described by the
president as ``the master of the calculated risk'' and a
``trailblazer in modern aviation.'' In the 1960s he was an executive
in the private aerospace industry.
   Bush said Kennan, 85, was ``truly a visionary'' on U.S.-Soviet
relations. In addition to writing extensively on that subject, he
served in the State Department as head of the policy planning staff
and as counsel, and later was ambassador to the Soviet Union from
1952 to 1953 and ambassador to Yugoslavia in the early 1960s.
   Mrs. Smith, 91, the former Republican senator and congresswoman
from Maine, gained fame for her speech denouncing the tactics of
1950s anti-communism crusader Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. She
served in Congress under six presidents, beginning with Franklin
Roosevelt in 1940.
   Dillon, 79, former ambassador to France and undersecretary of
state in the 1950s and Treasury secretary from 1961 to 1965, was
praised by Bush for his contributions to Latin America and Western
Europe policy as well as tax policy.
   Bush called Miss Ball, 77, ``the first lady of television'' and
said, ``She was like everyone's next door neighbor, only funnier.''
She died April 26 after a lifetime in entertainment, remembered
mostly for one of television's all-time most popular shows, ``I Love
Lucy.''

   The number of cases of AIDS reported to the World
Health Organization totaled 167,373 by July 1, marking an increase
by more than 10,000 from the previous month, according to WHO
statistics released Thursday.
   The WHO estimates the actual number is more than twice as high
and at least 1 million new cases are expected worldwide by 1993.
   Updates from Kenya, more than doubling the previous figure, and
from the United States made up most of the newly reported cases
registered by the WHO as of July 1.
   So far, 149 countries or territories have reported at least one
case. Twenty-eight countries, mainly in Asia, advised the WHO they
had no cases.
   Kenya reported 5,949 cases by March 31, or 3,217 more than the
previous total dated June 30, 1988, while the United States listed
95,561 cases, an increase by 2,842 between May 9 and May 31.
   Updates from Burkina Faso, Burundi, and Zambia also contributed
to the overall rise in reported AIDS cases in Africa by more than
5,000 to 29,906.
   Among the world's more populous countries, Uganda has the highest
AIDS rate with 26.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. It has the
second-highest total with 6,772 cases listed in January.
   Brazil, with 6,421 cases, has a rate of 1.9; France has a rate of
4.2 and the fourth-highest total worldwide, 6,409. European updates
during June included Italy, from 3,494 to 3,773 and West Germany,
from 3,086 to 3,324.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   An Indian social service agency filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection today, two weeks after the IRS shut down
its community center because of more than $700,000 in debts.
   The Boston Indian Council's community center had provided day
care, family counseling, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, job
training, cultural activities and other social services.
   A Chapter 11 filing allows a company or organization to hold off
creditors while it continues to operate and puts its finances in
order.
   Greg Buesing, an attorney whose firm represented the council,
said the group owed about $500,000 to the IRS for payroll taxes,
penalties and interest, and more than $200,000 to other creditors.
   Many people cried when the agency's dilapidated brick building
was closed, said Reva Crawford, education director at the council.
Massachusetts has about 5,000 Indians of voting age.
   ``This was the only place they could come where people spoke
their language, knew their ceremonies and dances,'' Crawford said.
   Buesing said the council had about $2.5 million in federal and
state funding in the early 1980s, but grants dried up under the
Reagan administration. By 1989, the group's budget had fallen to
$1.5 million.
   ``They didn't have any private working capital or a source of
private funds to make ends meet and things got out of control,''
Buesing said. ``They spent money that wasn't there and didn't cut
programs fast enough.''

   China published a report Thursday condemning
prominent intellectuals who spoke out on political and economic
issues in recent months. The report indicated the government was
intensifying its 5-week-old crackdown on dissent.
   The report also stepped up criticism of ousted Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang and accused his aides and advisers of
collaborating with student leaders in efforts to overthrow the
government.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong read the report June 30 to the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, which meets between
annual sessions of the full congress. It was made public Thursday
after the congress approved it.
   When party officials urged Zhao to call a meeting in April to
discuss the growing student movement, Zhao ``went golfing as if
nothing had happened,'' the report said. Later he encouraged frank
press reports of the subsequent protests, it said.
   ``Because he took such an attitude, the party and the government
lost a chance to stop the turmoil,'' the report said.
   Zhao was sacked after being accused of trying to split the party
and supporting the student-led demonstrators. He has been stripped
of his party and government posts, but references to him in the
official press as ``comrade'' indicate he retains his party
membership.
   The government report stopped just short of accusing Zhao of
taking part in the alleged anti-government conspiracy by those under
him.
   It singled out not just people who took part in the protests but
intellectuals, who it said created a climate that encouraged the
protests.
   Some of the intellectuals Chen named are known to have escaped
China or gone underground in the last month, while others have been
arrested. By naming individuals and describing their activities in
detail, the report appeared to signal a widening purge of
intellectuals.
   Although the student protests began in April, intellectuals had
become increasingly outspoken on political, cultural and economic
issues since late last year as problems in China's 10-year-old
economic reform program became evident.
   Thinkers and writers held forums and published unofficial
magazines to criticize government policy, and signed petitions for
an amnesty for political prisoners. The report said this ``prepared
for the turmoil that ensued.''
   Chen singled out more than a dozen people, including leading
dissident Fang Lizhi, who has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy, and
political theorists Yan Jiaqi and Su Shaozhi, who have fled to the
West.
   A publishing company official said authorities have banned
publication of works by Fang and people accused of ``ideological
mistakes.''
   Also Thursday, the National People's Congress appointed a new
ambassador to the United States in a climate of worsening relations
between the two countries. Zhu Qizhen, who had been vice foreign
minister and who speaks fluent English, was named to replace Han Xu,
who held the post for four years.
   State TV said Han's term was up. He was recalled to Beijing last
week along with China's other ambassadors for what the Foreign
Ministry called a regular meeting. Western diplomats said it was the
first such general recall in decades.
   Jiang Zemin, who replaced Zhao as party chief, told a visiting
Indian delegation that China would not change its policies in
response to foreign economic sanctions. It was his first meeting
with a foreign visitor since taking office June 24.
   Jiang did not single out the United States, which has halted
military sales and high-level contacts to protest China's June 3-4
army attack on the protesters.
   The congress' Standing Committee, however, passed a resolution
expressing ``strong indignation'' over the U.S. action.
   Also Thursday, the Foreign Ministry sharply rejected a U.S.
Embassy protest over an army attack on foreign diplomatic housing.
   The embassy had charged that the army made a premeditated attack
on targeted apartments, including those of American diplomats, when
it fired on the housing complex last month. The official Xinhua News
Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu gave U.S. Ambassador
James Lilley a note rejecting the accusation as groundless and
irresponsible.
   Leading newspapers joined the offensive with commentaries
blasting alleged U.S. efforts to undermine socialist countries. One
commentary by the editor of a leading party magazine, Seek Truth,
said in an analysis that conflict is inevitable between the
socialist and capitalist systems.
   ``We cannot ... lose our vigilance,'' Wu Jianguo wrote.
   The Standing Committee approved two Cabinet changes. Labor
Minister Luo Gan was replaced with a former public security
minister, Ruan Chongwu, and Chemical Industry Minister Qin Zhongda
was replaced with Gu Xiulian, who until recently was governor of
Jiangsu province.
   It was not clear if the changes were linked to the party's
political shakeup.

   Sixteen years ago, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh and
Robert Marley released ``Catch a Fire.'' The album catapulted the
reggae trio to international fame.
   A world tour followed. But Wailer, who is more at home in the
hills of his native Jamaica than the concert stage, returned home
and vowed never to go on the road again.
   The mystical mountain man busied himself writing and recording
songs on his own label, Solomonic, and farmed the land at the same
time.
   ``I think I love the country actually a little bit more than the
city,'' Wailer said. ``It has more to do with life, health and
strength. The city takes that away sometimes. The country is good
for meditation. It has fresh food and fresh atmosphere _ that keeps
you going.''
   This year, he launched a tour to support his ``Liberation'' LP,
which took him to 13 cities in the United States.
   His recent performance at Radio City Music Hall with the Switch
Dance Troupe marked his first New York appearance since selling out
Madison Square Garden in a solo concert nearly three years ago.
   Wailer was born Neville O'Reilly Livingston 42 years ago. His
career began in 1963 in a Kingston, Jamaica, slum when he and his
childhood friend, Robert Nesta Marley, teamed with Winston Hubert
McIntosh, later to be known as Peter Tosh, to form the legendary
group, the Wailers.
   After the release of their first hit, ``Simmer Down'' in 1964,
the Wailers' popularity spread throughout Jamaica. By 1966, they had
five records in the Jamaican Top 10. But the pulsating sound of
reggae went largely unnoticed by the rest of the world until the
``Catch a Fire'' LP.
   On their first tour, they met thunderous applause as audiences
throughout the world jammed stadiums, packed concert and theater
stages and lined dance halls to catch a glimpse of those ``natty
dreadlocks'' from Jamaica.
   While Marley and Tosh lost no time blazing international trails
for themselves, Wailer headed for the Jamaican countryside to be
close to nature.
   Marley, whose ``I Shot the Sheriff'' was covered by such rockers
as Eric Clapton, and who had become the biggest of the reggae stars,
died of a brain tumor at the age of 36 in 1981.
   Tosh, who left the Wailers in 1973 and formed his own group,
Word, Sound and Power, was nominated for a Grammy for the LP
``Captured Live'' in 1985. He was gunned down and killed in his
Jamaican home on Sept. 11, 1987, at the age of 42.
   Tosh's son, Andrew, joined Wailer on portions of the
``Liberation'' tour.
   Marley and the Wailers did more to popularize and refine reggae
than any other artists. They had hits with ``Stir It Up,'' ``Get Up,
Stand Up,'' ``No Woman, No Cry'' and ``Could You Be Loved.''
   Bunny Wailer considers himself just as much a farmer as a
musician, and helped provide food for victims of Hurricane Gilbert
last fall.
   ``Sometimes people pay less attention to those things (food) but
they turn out to be the most important things. I am a farmer,'' said
Wailer, who was in the United States when the hurricane smashed into
the Caribbean island.
   Wailer chartered a jet, filled it with food and flew to Jamaica.
When Wailer returned to his farm on the border of Portland and St.
Thomas parishes, he found his home undamaged.
   ``Liberation,'' his fourth album on the Shanachi label, includes
messages on hunger, drug abuse, apartheid and freedom. The LP also
contains a copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   ``Based on the history it projects, it's taken 400 years to
write,'' Wailer said in an interview. ``When I said I was going into
the studio, that only took four months. But to get all these things
together, it has taken my lifetime and so many other lifetimes
before.''

   A woman who kept her pregnancy a secret
allegedly killed her newborn son by slashing his throat with a razor
blade after she gave birth in the bathroom of a drug store, police
said Thursday.
   ``She was apparently overwhelmed by the enormity of the
pregnancy,'' said Nassau County police Lt. John Nolan. ``She just
decided she would kill the baby.''
   Christine Forsyth, 21, of Uniondale, gave birth at the drug store
in Merrick, where she worked as a cashier, Wednesday afternoon, then
killed the baby with a razor blade used to open cartons, Nolan said.
Co-workers found the body in a trash bin in the bathroom.
   Forsyth was to be arraigned Thursday or Friday on a second-degree
murder charge at the Nassau County Medical Center, where she was
being treated for bleeding from the birth.
   Forsyth, 4-foot-10 and heavy-set, had concealed her pregnancy
from her boyfriend and parents, Nolan said.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down New York City Law Protecting Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's highest court today struck down a
New York City law designed to help the homeless by forcing owners of
one-room apartments to rent them out.
   The Court of Appeals ruled 5-2 ruled that the five-year
moratorium on redevelopment of single-room occupancy hotels was an
unlawful taking of private property.
   ``No one minimizes the tragic reality of homelessness,'' said
Judge Stewart Hancock Jr. ``But the city's response _ to foist its
responsibility on certain private property owners, by requiring them
to remain in the SRO business or ransom their property rights _
simply does not meet the requirements of the city and state
constitutions.''
   In a dissent, Judge Joseph Bellacosa complained about property
rights being held more important than social policy. He recalled
that past courts struck down child labor laws because they hurt
business.
   The 1985 New York City law prevents owners from demolishing SRO
hotels unless they pay $45,000 a room into a fund to try to save
housing for the poor, elderly and sick.
   The city said its goal of trying to save 52,000 apartments and
not forcing residents out into the street justified such measures.
   But the appeals court, overturning a lower-court ruling, said the
law requires property owners ``to surrender the most basic
attributes of private property, the rights of possession and
exclusion.
   The court noted that the city spent much of the 1970s trying to
get SRO owners to tear down housing it considered a blight. About
40,000 rooms were demolished to make way for office buildings and
housing for the rich.

<HEAD>Church Authorities Declare 65th Miracle at Lourdes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOURDES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sicilian woman's malignant tumor has
been cured following her pilgrimage to Lourdes, religious
authorities said Thursday, declaring it the 65th miracle at the
Roman Catholic shrine.
   Dr. Theodore Mangiapan, head of the Medical Bureau of Lourdes,
said his panel and two other church medical commissions had
determined that Delizia Cirolli's cure could not be explained
medically.
   In Catania, Sicily, Archbishop Luigi Bommarito said investigators
had ``acknowledged the `miraculous' character'' of her case.
   Miss Cirolli, 24, visited Lourdes in August 1976, suffering from
a malignant tumor in her right leg. Doctors had said they should
amputate the leg, but soon after her pilgrimage, the tumor began to
heal, Mangiapan said.
   ``Delizia never received any specific treatment, neither surgery,
nor physiotherapy nor chemotherapy and she had only one thing to do
and that was to die,'' he said.
   Her health was monitored closely, allowing medical authorities to
note that her cure was ``perfect and definitive,'' a requirement for
a cure to be recognized as a miracle.
   The grotto at Lourdes became a shrine after a girl named
Bernadette Soubirous had 18 visions of the Virgin Mary recognized by
the church starting in 1858.
   More than 4 million people from as many as 150 countries travel
to Lourdes annually seeking the water from the grotto.
   Miss Cirolli's healing was the 65th miracle recognized at Lourdes
since 1862, although there have been more than 6,000 claimed
recoveries. There are about 2,500 cases waiting to be declared
miracles.

<HEAD>Worry About Cambodia Grows as Vietnamese Withdrawal Nears</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and
pro-Western nations of Southeast Asia pressed hard for Vietnamese
withdrawal from Cambodia, but as it nears, their nervousness about
what happens next is almost palpable.
   Vietnam says all its military forces will be out of Cambodia by
the end of September, after nearly 11 years. What will replace
Vietnamese occupation has dominated discussions here this week among
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and foreign ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   The best result would be a negotiated settlement between the
three resistance factions and the Hanoi-sponsored government, laying
the groundwork for peace in Cambodia for the first time in a
generation.
   The worst would be a power vacuum, with each contending party
trying to fill it through the use of force, because the strongest
resistance army is the brutal Khmer Rouge.
   Hundreds of thousands of people were executed or died of
starvation while the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from the end of the
Indochina war in April 1975 to the Vietnamese invasion of December
1978. Some estimates say more than 1 million perished.
   France, once the colonial power in Indochina, has taken the
diplomatic initiative as the Vietnamese withdrawal approaches,
inviting the Cambodian factions to peace talks in Paris in two weeks.
   It plans to follow the talks immediately with an international
conference involving the ASEAN members Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   Also attending would be the United States, Soviet Union, Britain,
China and France, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council.
   The Cambodian issue was the glue that kept the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations together over the past decade, and some
delegates to the meeting in Brunei wondered whether it could
continue after a settlement.
   American officials seem undecided about whether the French acted
precipitately. Renewed civil war could result if the initiative
fails, but the French view that decisive action is required also
could be a catalyst for peace negotiations.
   To Baker, the requirements for a durable settlement are clear.
   He said in a speech Thursday it should include a cease-fire;
cessation of foreign military aid to all factions; an interim
coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former
Cambodian head of state, and an international force to monitor free
elections.
   All the delegates are aware, however, that the problem in
Cambodia goes beyond ordinary factionalism.
   They are aware that history may not judge them kindly if the
result of their long diplomatic effort is the return of the Khmer
Rouge to power. China also could be expected to share in the
criticism because of its role in arming the Khmer Rouge.
   Baker spoke for delegates when he said Thursday that the goal of
transforming Cambodia from ``a battlefield to a marketplace''
requires ``our resolve and our unity of purpose, now more than
ever.''

   A wayward dolphin has left the East River and
steadily moved north up the Hudson River instead of heading back to
the ocean, indicating it may be sick, researchers said.
   The bottle-nosed dolphin was last spotted near West Point on the
Hudson, at least 40 miles north of Wards Island in the East River,
where it lingered for more than a week, the Okeanos Ocean Research
Foundation said Wednesday. The animal was first spotted June 20 in
the East River.
   Marine biologists had planned to try herding the dolphin from the
East River to open waters by playing recorded sounds of killer
whales underwater. But those plans were canceled Saturday when the
dolphin moved north.
   ``Such aberrant movement up the East River and Hudson River may
indicate that the animal was sick prior to entering the East River,
and its condition is not improving,'' Okeanos said in a news release.
   Okeanos said the animal may not survive in the Hudson River, so
it is considering capturing it with nets or a hoop capture line.
Capture is a last resort since the stress could kill the dolphin.

<HEAD>U.S. Governors Discuss Trade Program With Common Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. governors met Thursday with
officials of the European Community to learn how their states can
gain from the trading bloc's plans to create a single market in late
1992.
   ``We're out to find markets for goods and products that are
produced in our respective states,'' said Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles, chairman of the National Governors' Association.
   ``At the same time, we're interested in presenting our states as
places to do business for other companies,'' he told a news
conference at the European Community headquarters in Brussels.
   Baliles and the governors of Iowa, Washington, New Jersey, Utah,
Vermont, Kentucky and Puerto Rico held discussions at the European
Commission, the executive body of the 12-nation Common Market.
   The governors met with officials at the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the U.S. Mission to the Common Market. They
were scheduled to meet Friday with members of the European
Parliament, the trading bloc's legislative body.
   Frans Andriessen, foreign affairs chief for the European
Commission, the community's executive body, said the governors
talked mostly about the plans to eliminate by late 1992 the many
trade barriers separating the dozen EC nations. The idea is to form
a European-wide market in which people, goods, services and money
can move freely.
   Andriessen said the officials discussed the opportunities the
single market ``will create for people inside and outside the
European Community and the irreversibility of the process and the
implications it will have for external relations.''
   Baliles said the governors want to hold further discussions with
EC officials.
   American states, he said, ``are vulnerable to foreign competition
_ that was once very remote ... We have lost our economic
insularity. We are affected by events, places and people beyond our
borders.''
   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin said, ``A large percentage of the
jobs in our respective states ... are very heavily dependent on
decisions now being made and will continue to be made by the
European Community.''
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad noted the United States and the Common
Market are at odds over a number of agricultural issues, including
the trading bloc's costly farm subsidy program.
   He described the community's ban on meat from U.S. cattle treated
with growth hormones as ``an improper and unfair barrier to free
trade'' in beef.
   Andriessen responded that the community's restrictions were
non-discriminatory, applying to not only foreign meat exporters but
also European farmers.
   ``It is unacceptable that one country takes unilaterally
retaliation measures which in our view are not compatible with
international rules,'' he said.
   On Jan. 1, the Common Market imposed a ban on hormone-treated
beef. The United States refused to comply and instead slapped stiff
duties on a variety of European products.
   In May, both sides agreed to allow U.S. ranchers who want to
export untreated beef to do so. They will have to submit to a
certification process drawn up by European officials. In return, the
United States agreed to reduce its retaliatory tariffs.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton arrived with the delegation but had to
return home for state business, officials said.

<HEAD>Cafe Owner Sues, Seeking Secret Pie Recipes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There's a pie fight at the Club Cafe.
Smack-dab in the middle of the gooey mess is the recipe for peanut
butter-cream pie and 13 other flavors.
   Long famous for its pastries, Club Cafe changed hands in the
spring. Chief pastry baker Mary Hampton Allen soon walked out,
citing differences with the new owner.
   She took with her the secret recipes for the famous pies.
   The new owner, Robert McNanna, hired another baker, but he says
the pies just aren't the same.
   So he's suing. The lawsuit in Hot Springs Chancery Court seeks to
force Ms. Allen to divulge the ingredients and the methods she used.
The lawsuit says the cafe ``could not continue without the ability
... to make and produce the various types and kinds of pies for
which it had become famous.''
   A court hearing is scheduled July 25.
   ``It's all in her head, she never wrote anything down,'' says Ms.
Allen's attorney, Steven D. Oliver. ``It's something she just
developed over the years. A pinch of this, a pinch of that.''
   McNanna contends that Ms. Allen promised to share her cooking
secrets.
   ``The recipes were my main concern. She said that she would teach
somebody how to bake them before she left. You never know what might
happen. She could get in a car wreck or something.''
   Pies have been big business for Club Cafe _ the restaurant sells
about 300 per week, by the slice. During Thanksgiving and Christmas,
sales quadruple.
   Club Cafe pies were first baked by Ms. Allen's relatives. She is
34 and virtually grew up at the cafe. The family operated the cafe
until forced to sell the majority of the stock to McNanna, according
to Oliver.
   Ms. Allen has filed a lawsuit of her own, attempting to regain
control of the cafe because she says McNanna is behind on mortgage
payments.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Terms Set by Shamir for Palestinian Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department today criticized the tough
terms set by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud
coalition for an election among Palestinian Arabs, but said it still
supports the plan.
   ``Partisan declarations, particularly if they appear to be more
restrictive or impose conditions, do not advance the process,''
spokesman Richard Boucher said of the steps taken by the Israeli
leader Wednesday in Tel Aviv under pressure from more hard-line
members of the political party.
   But the U.S. official stressed that the plan for elections among
Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza has the endorsement
of the Israeli Cabinet and the Bush administration and still
provides ``the most realistic way to advance the peace process.''
   Boucher called on Palestinians to accept the proposal and to open
talks with Israel `'to flesh out the details of the initiative and
to make elections and negotiaqtions work.''
   The election would choose Palestinian leaders to negotiate
temporary, local self-rule with Israel. After five years, Israel,
Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan would hammer out an overall
settlement.
   The conditions set Wednesday by Shamir did not represent any
change in the Israeli leader's position. And the Bush administration
is in accord with one of th major terms _ no Palestinian state to be
established on Israeli-held territory.
   Still, approval of the terms appeared to bind them more tightly
to any negotiations that might be held. They included a statement
that Israel would not give up territory and that Jews could keep
settling on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Ahmed Abdul-Rahman, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said in Tunis that the conditions approved by Shamir
and the Likud closed the door to peace.
   The PLO official said the nearly 19-month-old uprising by
Palestinians against Israeli control would be ``escalated because
this is the only answer to intransigence.''
   But the State Department, through spokesman Boucher, said it was
basing its policies on the plan approved in May by the Israeli
Cabinet and not by ``domestic Israeli politics.''
   The statement suggested a U.S. view that Shamir had compromised
with hard-liners in his party without really changing the proposal
itself.

<HEAD>Court: New Malpractice Trial After Doctor Saves Juror in Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH EDWARDSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge should have declared a mistrial when
a doctor accused of malpractice apparently saved the life of a juror
in front of the rest of the jury, an appeals court ruled Thursday.
   The jury may have been ``subliminally influenced'' by Dr. Ho Woon
Lee's performance when he administered aid to the stricken juror,
even though they found Lee liable for damages in a malpractice
lawsuit, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court ruled
unanimously. Supreme Court is New York state's trial-level court.
   Former patient Brayno Reome sued Lee because a drain had been
left in his leg after amputation surgery.
   During a recess in the Cortland County trial, a juror suffered
what appeared to be a heart attack or stroke. Lee ``administered aid
including a blow to the chest,'' according to the court.
   The other jurors were removed before an ambulance arrived.
   When the jurors returned, the judge told them the trial would
continue with an alternate juror. The next morning, the judge said
that the ill juror had not been admitted to the hospital and that he
was apparently fine.
   ``The likely conclusion to be drawn by the jurors was that Lee
had competently administered emergency medical care, possibly saving
their fellow juror's life,'' the court said in a decision by Justice
Paul Yesawich.
   The jury awarded Reome $3,500 for medical expenses and $10,000
for pain and suffering. Reome, a retired house painter, had
complained of pain for the nine months he remained Lee's patient in
1983 and 1984 before the drain was discovered and removed by another
doctor.
   The appeals court said the ``unconscionably low award suggests
that the jury was subliminally influenced to view Lee favorably at
(Reome's) expense.''
   A judge's instructions couldn't remove the ``favorable bias that
Lee's admirably humanitarian efforts created,'' the court said as it
sent the case back to Supreme Court for a new trial.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo has signed a law that gives
the nation's second-largest state one of the most sweeping sets of
restrictions on smoking in public places and at work.
   The law will prohibit smoking in auditoriums, elevators,
gymnasiums, food stores, shared taxicabs and limousines. Smoking
will be restricted to certain areas in restaurants, bowling alleys,
bingo halls, hospitals, theaters, indoor arenas, banks, waiting
areas and restrooms.
   ``The Clean Indoor Air Act will, we hope, save lives,'' said
Cuomo at a bill-signing ceremony Wednesday.
   In the workplace, smoking will be prohibited in a work area at an
employee's request. Non-smoking areas will have to be provided in
employee cafeterias, lunch rooms and lounges to meet employee
demand, up to 70 percent although more would be possible.
   Smoking in theater viewing areas, libraries, museums and mass
transit has long been prohibited in New York.
   The smoking law wouldn't apply in bars, hotel rooms, conventions,
private residences, private limousines, private automobiles, private
parties, tobacco stores and private boxes at indoor arenas, such as
luxury boxes at sports stadiums. Violators will be subject to fines
of up to $1,000.
   Businesses could also get an exemption if they could prove the
smoking ban would create a financial hardship.
   The law takes effect in early January except for the workplace
provisions, which take effect in early April.
   Some 41 other states have some sort of smoking restrictions, but
only Minnesota has a statewide law that's tougher than New York's,
according to the Washington D.C.-based Tobacco Free America Project.
California, the nation's largest state, has a patchwork of statewide
laws that are collectively weaker than New York's new statute, the
group said.
   Only Illinois, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama,
Louisiana, Wyoming and Missouri have no form of statewide smoking
restrictions. Officials at the Tobacco Free America Project said
they believed the New York law would help them win over the rest of
the nation.
   The drive to restrict smoking has come amid scientific findings
that non-smokers could still contract lung and heart disease from
breathing other people's smoke.

<HEAD>PR Executive Sentenced for Misusing Foundation to Aid Rebels</HEAD>

   A public relations executive who raised private
money to arm the Nicaraguan Contras was sentenced to two years'
probation today for illegally using a tax-exempt foundation for the
fund-raising effort.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris sentenced Richard Miller on
his guilty plea to conspiring to defraud the government by using the
foundation to finance the covert arms-supply operation when direct
U.S. military aid to the anti-leftist rebels was banned by Congress.
   Harris also directed Miller to perform 120 hours of community
service. He could have received up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   Miller and Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, who is scheduled to be
sentenced Friday by Harris, each entered guilty pleas to the
conspiracy charge nearly two years ago and cooperated with
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   They were the first defendants convicted as a result of Walsh's
investigation.
   In pre-sentencing remarks, Miller told the judge, ``I let my
guard down. It may have been blind patriotism, but that's no
excuse.'' Caught up in a cause he believed in, he said, ``I turned a
blind eye to the excesses of others and I crossed the line myself.''
   The guilty pleas by Miller and Channell were the basis of a
charge that former White House aide Oliver L. North conspired with
them to illegally use the National Endowment for the Preservation of
Liberty to raise donations for a non-tax-exempt purpose.
   The foundation, headed by Channell, used White House briefings
and meetings with then-President Reagan to help raise $10 million
from donors who included Texas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt.
   North was cleared of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury that
convicted him May 4 of trying to cover up the Iran-Contra affair and
illegally accepting a home security system.
   North was fined $150,000 on Wednesday by U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community
service.
   Miller testified that North let him take 10 percent of the
private donations as his cut for raising money. Miller said North
gave him lists of weapons the Contras needed to use during his
meetings with potential donors.

   The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee says Venezuela's investigation of a foreign exchange
scandal is causing some American corporations to re-examine their
investments in the country and to withdraw top executives.
   Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., in a letter to Venezuela's
ambassador here, said: ``At a time when economic growth is a
priority, it would be a shame to see foreign corporations
discouraged from investing in Venezuela or decide to curtail their
operations.''
   ``I do not wish to interfere in any way in domestic affairs or in
the judicial system in Venezuela; nor can I comment on the merits of
the case,'' Fascell said in his June 13 letter to Ambassador Simon
Consalvi.
   ``As a friend of Venezuela, however, I do wish to bring to your
attention the problems this case is causing for foreign business,''
he said. ``Some American corporations have removed their top
executives and are re-examining their investments in your country.''
   Fascell said that he has been told by executives of major
American corporations that a Venezuelan judge has issued arrest
warrants for several people, including American executives, ``on
charges of fraud in obtaining preferential foreign exchange.''
   ``I understand the charges involved do not permit those accused
to be granted bail,'' Fascell said. ``The executives involved claim
they and their corporations are innocent.''
   Replying, Ambassador Consalvi said his government ``does not
welcome any discouragement to the presence of foreign businesses and
investment,'' and in fact welcomes them.
   But he said the government, operating under a system of
separation of powers, respects ``the independence of the judicial
system.''
   He also noted that Venezuela acted in March to abolish the
multiple exchange rate system.
   Investigators in Venezuela have been examining allegations that
billions of dollars in illegal profits were skimmed from a now
disbanded office set up to distribute U.S. dollars at favorable
exchange rates for essential imports.
   The investigators have been quoted in published reports as saying
that some $2.4 billion of the $30 billion involved may have been
touched by fraud.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to France hardly
sparked the emotional outpouring seen last month in neighboring West
Germany, although he did find sympathetic support among those lining
the capital's boulevards.
   Compared to the mania that greeted the Soviet president in Bonn,
the French were described as more skeptical. The two-day visit was
one of long, private talks with President Francois Mitterrand and
intimate meals with French officials, not high-profile street
diplomacy.
   As expected, the high point of the trip was the speech delivered
Thursday, Gorbachev's last day in France, before the Council of
Europe in Strasbourg. He offered additional and rapid cuts in the
Soviet nuclear arsenal if NATO accepts negotiations on tactical
nuclear weapons.
   Political observers say the reserved reaction of the French
public can be traced, in part, to the national character.
   ``French crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than German
ones,'' said Dominique Moisi of the French Institute of
International Relations.
   Politics and history also shaped the French response. West
Germans view Gorbachev as the source of changes that could lead to a
reunified Germany. They also see the Kremlin, not the West, as the
best hope for getting missiles off their soil.
   ``The French expect much less of him and are more skeptical of
changes taking place in the Soviet Union,'' Moisi said.
   France no longer plays the pivotal role in international
diplomacy it did under Gen. Charles De Gaulle, who took France out
of NATO's unified military command and welcomed Soviet courting as a
way of irritating the United States.
   In recent years, France has become a defender of the Atlantic
Alliance.
   French intellectuals, many of whom surrendered their leftist
sympathies a decade ago, gave Gorbachev a lukewarm welcome when he
spoke at the Sorbonne.
   Nonetheless, a poll published by BVA-Paris Match before the visit
showed that Gorbachev enjoyed greater popularity with the French
than did President Bush or British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Sixty-six percent of those polled had ``a good opinion'' of
Gorbachev and 59 percent believed he was sincere in trying to reform
the Soviet Union.
   Fifty-two percent also believed Gorbachev's hold on power was
``fragile,'' compared with 82 percent of West Germans surveyed who
said they thought the Soviet leader's reforms would succeed.
   The French daily Le Monde ran an editorial Wednesday praising
perestroika but noting the many problems Gorbachev faces at home.
   ``The success of perestroika is everything,'' the editorial
noted, ``except assured. ... From all points of view we are
concerned, and the question then is to know not if, but how, we
should help democracy triumph everywhere on the common continent.''

   President Bush today deflected Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for swift negotiations over reductions
in short-range nuclear weapons, noting that NATO leaders said they
would not entertain such talks until agreement had been reached on
conventional forces.
   ``I don't want to get off track by reopening the'' issue of
short-range nuclear forces that Western leaders agreed to in
Brussels in May, Bush said.
   The president made his comments as he fielded questions from
reporters in preparation for his trip to Europe beginning Sunday.
   The president said he hoped to use his visits to Poland and
Hungary to nudge both Communist-controlled countries toward economic
democracy. ``Our challenge is to help creater the conditions under
which the Hungarians and Poles can recover economically and make the
transition ...,'' he said.

   Bush also said he is happy that former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North did not draw a jail term for Iran-Contra crimes. He
sidestepped a question of a possible pardon for the former White
House aide, noting the case is being appealed.
   North was given a suspended sentence and a $150,000 fine, and was
ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service in an anti-drug
program for his conviction on three counts.
   Bush fielded questions in the Executive Office Building across
the street from the White House. His audience consisted largely of
foreign reporters, although American journalists were permitted to
ask questions, as well.
   The president departs on Sunday for his two stops in Eastern
Europe before heading for an economic summit meeting in Paris and a
follow-up visit in the Netherlands.
   He said he hoped the summit would deal with worldwide
environmental concerns and make a contribution toward
non-inflationary growth.

   Oliver North's sentencing Wednesday leaves four
people still to be tried from the Iran-Contra affair.
   North's conviction was the fourth arising from the diversion of
profits from the secret sale of arms to Iran to aid the Nicaraguan
contra rebels.
   The remaining cases, in brief:
   _Former national security adviser John M. Poindexter, North's
boss for much of the period in question in 1985 and 1986. Poindexter
is charged with obstructing Congress and making false statements in
the various investigations. No trial date has been set yet.
   _Arms dealer Albert Hakim. He is charged with conspiring to pay
illegal gratuities in connection wih the provision of a security
fence at North's home and setting up a Swiss bank account for
North's children. No trial date has been set.
   _Arms dealer Richard V. Secord. Secord, a former Air Force
general, is also charged with conspiring to pay illegal gratuities
in connection with the fence and the bank account. Trial is
scheduled in Washington for Nov. 18.
   _Joseph F. Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica.
Fernandez is charged with four counts of lying to and obstructing
the inquiries of the Tower Commission and the inspector general of
the CIA about his role in helping North construct a secret resupply
airstrip. Trial is scheduled for July 24 in Alexandria, Va.
   The earlier convictions:
   _Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane. He pleaded
guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding information from
Congress. McFarlane was sentenced to two years' probation on March 3.
   _Public relations consultant Richard R. Miller. He pleaded guilty
to conspiring to defraud the government through illegal use of a
tax-exempt foundation to raise $3.2 million for the Contras. Miller
was sentenced today to two years' probation and ordered to perform
120 hours of community service.
   _Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, Miller's fund-raising colleague. He
pleaded guilty to the same conspiracy charge and is scheduled to be
sentenced Friday.

<HEAD>East Drenched in Best Tropical Storm Tradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big wet currently being administered to the
East is in the tradition of some serious drenchings of the past,
events when tropical storms got things started and then let nature
take its soggy course.
   ``It's not a frequent occurrence, but it happens,'' said storm
specialist Bob Case of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., noting that a similar situation created devastating
floods in West Virginia four years ago.
   ``This was not anything like a once-in-a-lifetime event, but it
wasn't a garden variety storm either,'' added Scott Kroczynski of
the National Weather Service's Office of Hydrology in Silver Spring,
Md.
   The flooding in the last day or two wasn't spread over a large
area, but was severe in some localities, explained Kroczynski and
co-worker Frank Richards.
   Intense rain drenched a relatively narrow strip from suburban
Washington to suburban New York on Wednesday, they noted, with 2 to
6 inches of rain in most areas but 10 inches or more in some spots,
especially in northern Delaware, where at least two people drowned.
   Many people are blaming tropical storm Allison for the intense
rain, which disrupted train service between New York and Washington,
swept away a camper in North Carolina and generally created
miserable conditions along the East Coast.
   Allison's remains, however, are in Alabama. That storm, despite
the intense rain it brought ashore in Texas and Louisiana more than
a week ago, isn't a direct part of the East Coast problems, Case
said.
   But it is taking some of the blame, he noted. And that's
appropriate, since it helped create the mess.
   ``The last similar situation was .... Hurricane Juan in 1985,
when severe flooding occurred in Virginia and West Virginia.'' Case
said.
   ``Juan did the same thing. It did not cause the flooding, but
(it) opened the the way,'' he said. Before Juan, tropical storm
Agnes in 1972 brought similar devastating rains, he explained.
   Allison came ashore in Texas, worked northward to reach western
Kentucky by last Monday, then drifted back to Alabama, where it is
now a low pressure area. At the same time, a high pressure center is
located off the East Coast.
   Air around a low moves in a counter-clockwise direction. Around
highs, it circulates clockwise.
   When they meet, those circulations are like two meshed gears
turning away, explained Case, with a low to the west turning
counterclockwise and a high to the east turning clockwise.
   That means the air flows combine between the two centers, pulling
warm, moist air northward from the Gulf of Mexico to ``inundate the
United States east of the Appalachians,'' Case explained.
   ``The real culprit is this inundation of tropical, unstable
air,'' he added.
   As it moves north, the warm, wet air rises, pushed up by the land
and generally lifted over cooler air already in the area. Rising air
cools; cooler air can hold less moisture than warm air, and _ bingo
_ the result is rain.
   Richards and Kroczynski explained that on Tuesday night and
Wednesday some cold air moved in above the warm tropical air in the
stretch between Washington and New York.
   This cold air, which was heavier and more dense, then sank down.
   That led to a sudden overturning of the cold and warm air. ``Once
it started, it was almost like a chain reaction,'' said Richards,
explaining the localized deluges.

   For Don Avenson, the full impact of a
Supreme Court ruling on abortion hit home during a Fourth of July
parade in the little northern Iowa town of Humboldt.
   ``People asked you about it as you drove by,'' said Avenson,
speaker of the Iowa House and a Democratic gubernatorial candidate.
   ``Obviously, an issue that none of us wanted involved in the
primary has been thrust upon us,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it is
such an issue that people don't want to talk about the other
things.''
   In Iowa, as in other states, the court's ruling Monday giving
states new freedom to restrict abortion has sharply altered what was
shaping up as a run-of-the-mill gubernatorial battle.
   ``God, it's a new ball game,'' said Joe Shanahan, a spokesman for
the Iowa Democratic Party. ``The entire scenario has changed.''
   The primary won't be held until June 1990, but four Democrats are
already running for the chance to oppose two-term incumbent
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad in November 1990.
   Attorney General Tom Miller, the only one of the four who wants
to limit abortion, was the early favorite in the race, with Avenson,
Lt. Gov. JoAnn Zimmerman and Des Moines banker John Chrystal distant
challengers.
   Miller, who has held statewide office for more than 10 years,
spent months quietly raising money, building an organization and
cultivating a moderate image. Democratic activists, hungry to oust
Branstad, were viewed as willing to accept something less than
liberal purity in their candidate.
   Then came abortion. Hours after the court decision, Miller called
on the Legislature to enact new abortion restrictions, saying ``we
should reduce and, if possible, eliminate abortions.'' The same day,
Avenson pledged to use his powerful legislative post to block any
attempt to restrict women's access to abortion.
   While Avenson has surfaced as the most visible opponent for
Miller on the abortion issue, Ms. Zimmerman has had trouble raising
money and Chrystal has languished in polls and visibility, leading
many Democrats to view the run as a two-person race.
   Iowa law currently is silent on abortion, because the Legislature
in 1976 removed all references in the wake of the Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion. That's precisely where it will stay,
pledged Avenson, and that's also good politics in a Democratic
primary.
   ``I believe that activists Democrats are by and large
pro-choice,'' said Avenson. ``They are comfortable with the status
of the situation now.''
   For his part, Miller accuses Avenson of being irresponsible and
divisive, damaging the party's chance in the general election.
   ``I don't think it will be a referendum on abortion,'' said
Miller. ``When this case is digested, people will see the debate is
about regulation of abortion, not prohibition of abortion.''
   While the candidates have heated up their rhetoric since the
court's decision, there have been other signs the abortion issue is
now deeply rooted in the campaign.
   Abortion rights activists _ heavily populated by liberal
Democrats _ picketed Miller's campaign headquarters, and feminists
have taken to launching anti-Miller chants at rallies.
   ``My gut reaction is a fairly sizable majority of activists are
pro-choice,'' said Shanahan. ``Activists tend to be opinionated.''
   ``They are perhaps a little more on the pro-choice side than the
general public,'' conceded Miller. ``I do note that I have three
opponents to carve up the pro-choice side.
   ``What's important is what the 60 percent to 80 percent of Iowans
in the middle think,'' said Miller. ``They are not going to be
induced to vote single-issue.''
   Spicing the debate between Avenson and Miller is a sharp
difference in campaign styles.
   Avenson is a burly outdoorsman who owns a tool-and-die business
and has built a reputation as a legislative wheeler-dealer. Miller
is a Harvard-trained lawyer who cultivates a polished image, working
to broaden his appeal beyond the party's traditional base to include
young professionals and others who have deserted Democrats in recent
elections.

<TEXT>
   A former engineer who spent 16 months in prison for
a crime he didn't commit has helped start a foundation to clear
people who are wrongly convicted of crimes.
   Lenell Geter, cleared of armed robbery charges by the Dallas
County district attorney's office in 1984, said the national
non-profit group Justice Denied Research Inc. will start
investigating cases later this month.
   A former E-Systems engineer, Geter told The Dallas Morning News
on Tuesday that his wife and their two daughters moved to Columbia,
S.C., last August because ``my ordeal changed things.''
   ``I could never overcome the fears I had,'' Geter, 31, said.
``There were always strange things that were happening. For the most
part, people greeted me real well.
   ``But those who showed no remorse to what happened to me became a
threat to me and my family.''
   Geter, now a social worker in South Carolina, declined to be more
specific. He will become chairman of the advisory board for the new
foundation.
   James Humphreys Jr., a Dallas private investigator given much of
the credit for Geter's release from prison, will examine many of the
cases, foundation officials said.
   The 1983 conviction of Jerry Wanzer for aggravated sexual assault
on an 8-year-old girl will be Humphreys' first case.
   A civil rights group described Wanzer's conviction and 25-year
prison sentence in 1986 as an example of ``gross racial injustice.''
But the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Wanzer's appeal in April
1987.
   ``The one thing I hope the foundation would do would be to
exonerate a person or persons who are incarcerated unjustly,'' Geter
told the newspaper.
   Geter said the foundation will seek cases in which substantial
evidence can be obtained to prove applicants' innocence, with
emphasis on defendants who could not afford thorough investigations
and whose court-appointed attorneys mounted an inadequate defense.
   ``Oftentimes, when an indigent person enters the judicial system,
he goes in with the minimum investigation and is later convicted,''
Geter said.

   Bush said he was untroubled by Gorbachev's rejection of the
American call for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland.
   ``We're not trying ... to make things more difficult for him,
just as when he goes to France and Germany, I don't think he's
trying to make things more difficult for us,'' he said.
   ``My trip over there is not to ... try to drive wedges between
the Sovuiet Union and Eastern Europe,'' Bush said. ``That is not
what 1989 diplomacy is about.''
   ``We're not going to be there trying to raise tensions,'' he
added of his trip to Poland.
   He said he wanted to ``extend to them whatever help we can'' and
help that country move toward more reform and more openness.''
   He noted he could not impose his wishes on the internal affairs
of the governments of Poland and Hungary, but made clear that he
hopes his visit there will assist a trend toward openness.
   Both countries have undergone dramatic political reforms in
recent months, including the admission of Solidarity union leaders
into the Polish parliament under unusually open elections.
   ``In Poland and Hungary, our strong support for the democratic
course these nations have chosen will be clear,'' he said. ``Their
efforts are not only a new beginning in their own countries, but can
be the beginning of an historic process of European reconciliation,
of ending the artificial division of Europe.
   ``We want to help these countries toward an alternative future, a
democratic alternative and help create a Europe that is whole and
free,'' he said.
   He also urged East Germany to join the trend of its Eastern
European neighbors.
   Asked whether he has preconditions for better relations with East
Germany, Bush said, ``Yes I do see preconditions: a little more
democracy, a little more freedom, a little more openness.''
   Addressing the East Germans directly, he said, ``Come along with
the flow. Things are changing in Eastern Europe.''
   ``The same could be said for Czechoslovakia, Romania, and
Yugoslavia,'' he said of the other countries under Soviet influence
since the end of World War II.

<HEAD>DC Priest Says Black Americans Need Church Within Church</HEAD>

   A Catholic priest who was suspended for
establishing a temple in defiance of church authorities said
Thursday he wants to establish a separate rite for black Americans
but is content to let someone else lead it.
   ``We don't want one Imani Temple,'' the Rev. George A. Stallings
said Thursday, three days after Cardinal James A. Hickey suspended
him for holding the renegade church service at Howard University Law
School. ``We want several hundred of them, several thousand.''
   But despite his determination to fly in the face of his church
authorities and his sudden national celebrity, Stallings says he
views himself a parish priest at heart.
   ``The only role that I see for myself is pastor of a local parish
community that is under the heading of an African-American Catholic
rite,'' said Stallings, who is black.
   Stallings, 41, says a new rite is needed with a black leadership
and clergy because the Roman Catholic Church is hopelessly mired in
its own white, European perspective. It's a charge that church
officials deny.
   Most other rites are ethnic churches within the Eastern Rite,
such as Maronite and Ukrainian churches. They have considerable
autonomy in ritual and discipline, but still accept the pope.
   Stallings also says that the church has ``has put its emphasis on
maintenance rather than mission,'' missing the opportunity to fill
many of the inner-city churches that were once filled with white
ethnics who have fled to the suburbs.
   ``I have been to cities where the church was closed,'' said
Stallings. ``Black protestants came in and took over, and now
they're packed to the gills.''
   Stallings proved Sunday he could pack a church, although critics
say he many of those were curiosity seekers and the crowds will
dwindle at Imani, Swahili for ``faith.''
   The service combined the traditional Catholic Mass with African
ritual and the foot-stomping, hand-clapping style of the traditional
black protestant church.
   Stallings' public act of defiance means he is now banned from
performing sacraments. According to a spokesman for Hickey,
Stallings's decision to ignore the cardinal's authority is hindering
his own stated effort to establish a new rite. Under church rules, a
request for a new rite would first go to Hickey.
   ``The difficulty is not that he tried those channels and is
blocked,'' said Rev. William Lori, Hickey's secretary. ``The
difficulty is that he has spurned those channels.''
   But Stallings says the church hierarchy, despite a number of
black bishops, is institutionally blind.
   ``It is difficult if not almost impossible for one ethnic or
cultural group to define or to decide what is good for another
ethnic group,'' he says. ``It is always necessary for those ethnic
groups to get a seal of approval from the white male power group.''
   At stake in the Stallings battle are 2 million black American
Catholics, a minority of both black people _ some 30 million in
America _ and American Catholics as a whole _ 54 million.
   According to church figures, there are 300 black priests and 13
black bishops. Of the 17,000 Catholic parishes, 1,200 are
predominantly black.
   Church officials say they are gaining rather than losing blacks,
although no one could immediately provide figures.
   ``I don't hear a hue and cry for breaking away,'' said Auxiliary
Bishop John H. Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the bishops'
committee on black Catholics of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops.
   ``The father's argument that there is racism in the church has
been acknowledged,'' Ricard said, adding ``there is a crying need
for our church to meet the social and economic needs of
African-Americans.''

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Happy North Not Going to Jail</HEAD>

   President Bush expressed pleasure today that
Oliver North was not sentenced to jail for his Iran-Contra
convictions, but sidestepped a question about whether he has
considered pardoning the former White House aide.
   ``I'm happy he's not going to jail,'' Bush said in answer to a
question during an interview with a group of journalists. ``I'm not
going to comment further because this matter is under appeal and is
in the federal courts.''
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced North on
Wednesday to a three-year suspended sentence, two years' probation,
$150,000 in fines and 1,200 hours of community service work.
   In a related case today, U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris
sentenced public relations consultant Richard Miller to serve two
years' probation and perform 120 hours of community service for
using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel private donations to North's
aid pipeline for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, who with Miller helped raise more than
$10 million for the Contras, is to be sentenced on Friday. Both men
had pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the government.
   Fifty-eight members of the House composed a letter to Bush urging
a pardon for North, arguing, ``It is time to put an end to the
political persecution of an honorable man who has served his country
with distinction.''
   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., who led the effort, still plans to
forward the letter to Bush even though it was written before the
sentencing and anticipated that North would draw a prison term,
spokesman Paul Morrell said today.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had no
comment on the sentencing and had not considered a pardon.
   ``We haven't discussed a pardon,'' Fitzwater said. ``There's been
no discussion. It hasn't ever been discussed.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he believed Bush should pardon
North because the fine was too high and the loss of the former
Marine Corps lieutenant colonel's pension was too stiff a penalty.
   The Navy announced that as a result of the sentencing it was
suspending North's $23,000-a-year pension earned in 20 years of
service. But it recommended the pension be restored by Comptroller
General Charles Bowsher, who has the final say.
   North said after the sentencing that he planned to press an
appeal of his conviction and looked forward to carrying out Gesell's
order that he devote 1,200 hours to a new program to help District
of Columbia youths avoid drug involvement.
   ``I welcome the chance to work for these folks and anybody in the
fight against drugs,'' North said.
   Gesell said he believes North still lacks understanding of ``how
the public service has been tarnished'' by his activities, adding,
``Jail would only harden your misconceptions.''
   The judge told North: ``Your notoriety has caused many
difficulties but it also has made you a rich man. ... You can
continue to flame the myth by which you have supported yourself
during these recent difficult years or you can turn around now and
do something useful.''
   North is free to continue the $25,000-a-speech tours that have
occupied his time since his conviction for aiding and abetting in
obstruction of Congress, for destroying or altering government
documents and for accepting a gratuity _ a security fence around his
home.
   The shredding conviction bars North from holding federal office.
   North had asked the judge for lenience.
   ``I have devoted nearly two decades to the service of our country
and I would never knowingly do anything to hurt it or any of its
institutions,'' he said in a soft voice. `` ... I grieve over what
has happened and I truly pray about it every day.''
   North was convicted on May 4 for his role in the Iran-Contra
affair, in which the government secretly sold weapons to Iran and
funneled some of the proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
During the trial, North argued he was merely following the orders of
superiors in the Reagan administration.
   Lawmakers on Capitol Hill generally applauded Gesell's sentencing
decision.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the chairman of the House Iran-Contra
Committee, called the sentence ``good and wise'' and said: ``Judge
Gesell balanced difficult facts, recognizing Colonel North's
distinguished military record and his devotion to family with the
fact the jury convicted him on three counts and his difficult
position with regard to his superiors.''
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra
Committee, said, ``I am certain that Judge Gesell's sentence is
appropriate, in light of the unique circumstances of this case.''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said: ``I don't think that anybody,
or very few people, wanted all of the additional chaos in the
country, the additional hard feelings that we have too much of right
now, of having Oliver North trundled off to jail waving the American
flag.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a North supporter, said on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America'' that the sentence ``was a little milder
than I had come to expect. We had been told Gesell was a hanging
judge and I think he really tempered justice with mercy in a
sentence which, all things considered, was pretty fair.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, interviewed with Hyde, sounded a
note of dissent. He called the sentence ``a disappointing surprise''
and said ``it makes it much more difficult for the special
prosecutor to go after other (Iran-Contra) cases and get a
conviction.''

<HEAD>Bush Deflects Gorbachev Call for Talks on Short-Range Weapons</HEAD>

   President Bush today deflected Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for swift negotiations over short-range
nuclear weapons, noting that NATO leaders agreed not to entertain
such talks until an accord had been reached on conventional forces.
   ``I don't want to get off track'' by reopening the issue of
short-range nuclear forces that Western leaders agreed to in
Brussels in May, Bush said.
   In a nationally televised session with foreign reporters designed
to set the stage for his European journey on Sunday, Bush said he
hoped to use his visits to Poland and Hungary to nudge both
Communist-controlled countries toward democracy.
   He insisted he wasn't trying to stir up trouble in Gorbachev's
backyard, saying, ``That is not what 1989 diplomacy is about.'' At
the same time, Bush called on East Germany and other less open
Warsaw Pact nations to ``come along with the flow.''
   He said he looked forward to a Europe that ``is whole and free.''
   ``Our challenge is to help create the conditions under which the
Hungarians and Poles can recover economically and make the
transition ...,'' he said of his pending visits to two nations in
the throes of extraordinary political and economic change.
   Bush also said he is happy that former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North did not draw a jail term for Iran-Contra crimes. He
sidestepped a question of a possible pardon, noting that the former
White House aide is appealing his conviction on three charges.
   North on Wednesday was given a suspended sentence and a $150,000
fine, and was ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service in
an anti-drug program.
   Bush fielded questions in the Executive Office Building across
the street from the White House. His audience consisted largely of
foreign reporters, although American journalists were permitted to
ask questions, as well.
   The president's two stops in Eastern Europe will precede an
economic summit meeting in Paris and a follow-up visit in the
Netherlands.
   He said he hoped the summit would deal with worldwide
environmental concerns and make a contribution toward
non-inflationary growth.
   Bush's reply to a question about Gorbachev's proposal appeared
carefully worded.
   ``The answer is to please read carefully what happened in
Brussels,'' he said. ``To look at the united NATO position and to go
forward ... with the agenda at hand. That will be the message. I
don't want to get off the track by reopening the short-range nuclear
forces package,'' he said.
   In a speech earlier in the day in Strasbourg, France, Gorbachev
offered to make additional and rapid cuts in his country's nuclear
arsenal if NATO accepts negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons.
   The speech seemed designed in part to increase pressure on the
United States to depart from an agreement with its allies on an
issue that dominated the NATO summit in May.
   The NATO agreement calls for negotiations to reduce short-range
nuclear missiles only after an East-West agreement has been reached
to reduce conventional forces and reductions are actually underway.
   ``I see no reason to stand here and try to change a collective
decision taken by NATO,'' the president said today.
   In his response to Gorbachev, Bush added, ``we welcome unilateral
cuts on his side, certainly.''
   Bush said he was untroubled by Gorbachev's rejection of the
American call for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland.
   ``We're not trying ... to make things more difficult for him,
just as when he goes to France and Germany, I don't think he's
trying to make things more difficult for us,'' he said.
   ``My trip over there is not to ... try to drive wedges between
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,'' Bush said. ``That is not what
1989 diplomacy is about.''
   ``We're not going to be there trying to raise tensions,'' he
added of his trip to Poland.
   He said he wanted to ``extend to them whatever help we can'' and
help that country move toward more reform and more openness.''
   He noted he could not impose his wishes on the internal affairs
of the governments of Poland and Hungary, but made clear that he
hopes his visit will assist a trend toward openness.
   Both countries have undergone dramatic political reforms in
recent months, including the admission of Solidarity union leaders
into the Polish parliament under unusually open elections.
   ``In Poland and Hungary, our strong support for the democratic
course these nations have chosen will be clear,'' he said. ``Their
efforts are not only a new beginning in their own countries, but can
be the beginning of an historic process of European reconciliation,
of ending the artificial division of Europe.
   ``We want to help these countries toward an alternative future, a
democratic alternative and help create a Europe that is whole and
free,'' he said.
   Asked whether he has preconditions for better relations with East
Germany, Bush said, ``Yes I do see preconditions: a little more
democracy, a little more freedom, a little more openness.''

   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks at
a news conference Thursday.
   Bush: Everybody please be seated. Well, first I have a brief
statement. And then I'd be glad to take your questions.
   Our trip will take us first to Poland, then Hungary _ two
countries engaged in unprecedented efforts toward economic and
political reform. The next stop, Paris, to join in the celebration
of France's centennial _ bicentennial _ and to participate in the
15th Economic Summit. Finally, our journey ends in the Netherlands
for the first-ever visit by an American president to one of our
oldest and closest allies.
   In Poland and Hungary, our strong support for the democratic
course these nations have chosen will be clear. Their efforts are
not only a new beginning in their own countries but can be the
beginning of an historic process of European reconciliation, of
ending the artificial division of Europe. We want to help these
countries toward an alternative future, a democratic alternative,
and to help create a Europe that is whole and free.
   Certainly Poland and Hungary face serious economic problems. And
no amount of outside assistance can substitute for their own
sustained efforts. Our challenge is to help create the condition
under which the Poles and the Hungarians can recover economically
and make a successful transition towards democracy.
   And therefore, immediately following this session today, there's
going to be a White House Symposium on Eastern Europe. And our aim
is to involve American private-sector leaders in the support of
change in Poland and Hungary. In the long run, their participation
is essential if democracy is to succeed in Eastern Europe.
   Our efforts during the economic summit in Paris are just as
critical in helping end the economic and political division of
Europe, and that's why we will propose ways to work together to
assist economic recovery and democratic change in Poland and
Hungary. We believe the Western democracies must coordinate their
economic and technical assistance programs to provide real help at a
time of historic change in these two countries and help reintegrate
their economies into the global economy.
   Our key economic objective at the summit is to sustain
non-inflationary growth. And in order to move the international
trading system into the next century, we need to commit to conclude
the Uruguay Round negotiations with substantial results in all
areas, including agriculture, by the end of 1990.

   We've already announced new measures to strengthen the
international debt strategy through the Brady Plan, with its
emphasis on economic growth and investment. And to fulfill our
commitment at the Toronto Economic Summit, beginning October 1, the
U.S. government will forgive official development loans of the
sub-Saharan countries.
   There are other challenges that need to be met. It is time that a
summit address our natural heritage and let Paris then be known as
the summit which accepted the environmental challenge. The U.S.
leads the world in environmental protection and research. We invite
others to join in our efforts and to support our goal of a cleaner,
healthier global environment.
   Our trip is going to conclude with a visit to the Netherlands
where we will discuss with Dutch leaders our broad range of shared
interests. This will also be an occasion for celebrating America's
longest, unbroken diplomatic relationship and for reaffirming the
vitality of America's routes in Europe and the strength of our
trans-Atlantic ties.
   I'd be glad to take questions.
   Q: Mr. President, Mr. Gorbachev challenged you again today to
negotiate to eliminate short-range missiles in Europe. Is the answer
still no and always no?
   Bush: The answer is to please read carefully what happened at
Brussels, to look at the united NATO position and to go forward _
and we've had encouraging sounds from the Soviets on this _ go
forward with the agenda at hand and that'll be the message, and I
don't want to get off-track by re-opening the SNF question when we
have a good package that has wide support. The big thing, the
post-NATO action, is to move forward in meeting our timetables and
in fairness, I should say I was very pleased that Mr. Gorbachev made
a comment _ I believe it was in Germany _ that that timetable was
not too ambitious.
   Q: If I may follow up on the same question, Mr. Gorbachev is
asking about these tactical forces, who needs them, and the question
does arise: What, if anything, NATO has to fear from accepting his
offer of unilateral cuts on his side, considering that during the
course of any such negotiations NATO would presumably retain its own
tactical capability, as you have suggested, pending conventional
cuts?
   Bush: If your question is, `Would we welcome unilateral cuts on
his side,' certainly.
   Q: From your remarks, sir ...
   Bush: Maybe that wasn't the question, but that's the answer.
(Laughter.) You left yourself open by leaving that part of it, sure,
we would welcome that.
   Q: From your remarks, sir ...
   Bush: That wasn't what he said, however ...
   Q: From your remarks, sir, you say you want the Paris summit to
accept the environmental challenge. You want polluters to pay. Does
that mean you are going with budgetary commitments and do you want
the other six nations as well to make budgetary commitments to make
polluters pay?
   Bush: Well, I'm not sure we're going to get into that. I've given
our proposals here in the United States for revisions of the Clean
Air Act and things that we feel are important domestically. But we
do support negotiations that, you know, on other subjects leading
toward the framework, for example, the framework convention on
global warming. We can focus our efforts on reducing or preventing
pollution at the outset rather than cleaning it up afterwards.
   These are the broad questions we're going to be talking about.
I'm concerned about deforestation and tried to show some support for
that in a trip I took to North Dakota and working with our head of
our environment on reforestation. And I think here's a question
that's going to have enormous interest in the summit. So it's going
to be on these broad tactics rather than trying to indicate to our
European partners how they should handle their own domestic
pollution problems.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
challenged NATO unity Thursday with a unilateral Kremlin offer to
scrap more nuclear missiles and made bold proposals laying a
foundation for a ``common European home'' to end Cold War divisions.
   In a wide-ranging address capping a three-day visit to France,
Gorbachev also gave his clearest assurance the Soviet Union might
someday be prepared to tolerate non-Communist regimes in Eastern
Europe.
   ``The social and political order in some particular countries did
change in the past, and it can change in the future,'' Gorbachev
told the Council of Europe, a 23-nation assembly of West European
democracies.
   To deepen ``all-around cooperation'' on both sides of what once
was dubbed the Iron Curtain, Gorbachev proposed a list of
pan-European projects he called ``urgent.'' These included a
high-speed railway spanning the continent, an all-European TV
satellite system and cooperation to heighten safety in the
processing and storing of nuclear waste.
   After the speech, Daniel Tarschys, a Liberal member of the
Assembly from Sweden, said Gorbachev ``gave the green light to
further cooperation between East and West Europe.''
   The Strasbourg-based Council of Europe last month granted the
Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia ``special guest
status'' to encourage relations and recognize the impact of current
political reforms taking place in the countries.
   Gorbachev's address to the Council, a separate body from the
12-member European Economic Community trade bloc, had been expected
to elaborate on the idea of a ``common European home,'' which the
Soviets define as stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals.
The concept was first mentioned by Gorbachev in 1985.
   But, Gorbachev told the parliament members, ``even today, I do
not claim to carry a finished blueprint of that home in my pocket.''
   Much of his speech dwelt instead with disarmament and security
concerns and with specific proposals for East-West cooperation in
Europe.
   ``The Europeans can meet the challenges of the coming century
only by pooling their efforts,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's remarks on disarmament from the podium in the
assembly hall of the ultramodern Palace of Europe seemed designed to
force a break in a hard-won compromise reached by NATO members last
month in Brussels.
   The compromise by North Atlantic Treaty Organization members
agreed to link future negotiations in tactical nuclear arms to
results obtained at the Vienna talks seeking Europe-wide reductions
in conventional weaponry. At the Brussels meeting, West Germany won
agreement that bargaining with the Soviets on tactical missiles
would begin, but not until conventional arms reductions wre under
way _ 1992 at the earliest.
   The United States and Britain held fast for agreements that such
talks would aim at only a partial reduction of the U.S. and Soviet
warheads.
   The Soviets complained the agreement would cause delays in arms
reduction and, in his speech, Gorbachev expressed amazement at the
logic of the compromise.
   ``Only Europeans who have no intention of waging war against one
another are threatened by those weapons,'' he said. ``The ultimate
objective is to completely eliminate those weapons.''
   He did not specify how many rockets his country would be willing
to destroy. Soviet officials have acknowledged they have 1,608
short-range nuclear missiles with a range of about 300 miles to
NATO's 136, a 12-to-1 advantage.
   ``If it became clear that NATO countries are ready to join us in
negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons, we could, naturally, after
consulting our allies, carry out without delay further unilateral
reductions in our tactical nuclear missiles in Europe,'' Gorbachev
said.
   In Washington, President Bush deflected Gorbachev's call for
swift negotiations over reductions in short-range nuclear weapons,
noting that NATO leaders said they would not entertain such talks
until agreement had been reached on conventional forces.
   ``I don't want to get off track by reopening the'' issue of
short-range nuclear forces, Bush said in a news conference before
his trip to Europe beginning Sunday.
   Bush also said he hoped to use his visits to Poland and Hungary
to nudge both Communist-controlled countries toward democracy.
   The last Soviet offer to scrap nuclear weapons _ about 500
warheads _ came in May during a visit to Moscow by U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and while the United States, West Germany
and Britain were brawling about whether to modernize NATO's few
remaining short-range missiles or trade them away.
   Peter Hardy, a member of parliament from Britain's opposition
Labor Party, called Gorbachev's conditional arms cut offer ``a major
step forward.''
   ``He offered olive branches,'' Hardy said.
   During his three-day visit to France, Gorbachev held talks with
French President Francois Mitterrand in Paris, and both leaders
signed more than 20 agreements on trade and other bilateral matters.
   Gorbachev, accompanied to France by his wife Raisa, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and other top officials,
left Strasbourg on Thursday for Bucharest, Romania, where he will
attend an annual summit meeting of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
military alliance that begins Friday.

<HEAD>Federal Housing Agency Money Spent On High-Rolling Lifestyle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENDAL WEAVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For three years, federal housing
officials in Alabama lost track of $2 million in government money.
It was supposed to help middle-income home buyers, but records
indicate it went instead for a $50,000 Mercedes, an $18,000 speed
boat, jewelry, furs and video equipment.
   Documents obtained from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development by The Associated Press allege that Montgomery real
estate broker Cy Walker hid the money with the help of blank forms
that he apparently got from an unwitting First Alabama Bank employee.
   Walker, who handled sales of HUD's foreclosed homes in the
Montgomery area, put agency money from the sales closings into a
First Alabama account that he alone controlled, according to HUD
documents. Those records and AP interviews indicate that Walker
appeared to underwrite a high-rolling lifestyle.
   The documents also depict a federal agency without adequate
controls over its multimillion-dollar Alabama operation. Such
controls, according to a HUD memo, finally were put in place on Nov.
9, 1987. That same day, Walker closed out the First Alabama account,
withdrawing the last $136.54.
   By then, after three years, slightly more than $2 million in HUD
money had been deposited in the account but not sent to the federal
agency, the records indicate. Some of it appears to have been spent
on HUD-related expenses, such as maintenance on foreclosed homes and
attorney's closing fees. But HUD records, including canceled checks,
also show it was used by Walker in part for the following purchases:
   _ A $50,000 sports car. Laurens Pierce III, spokesman for Jack
Ingram Motors in Montgomery, said salesmen recall that Walker bought
a Mercedes 560 SL convertible. In all, a HUD audit listed nearly
$180,000 in checks written by Walker to car dealers, including Cobb
Pontiac Cadillac, which received $14,185 on one occasion, $27,153 on
another, and $12,595 on a third.
   _ An $18,870 speed boat from Kowaliga Marina. The office manager
at the marina said it was a Stingray _ ``the Cadillac of speed
boats,'' she said.
   _ More than $31,000 worth of electronics and appliances from The
Record Shop. Some of the purchases, such as stoves, could have gone
to HUD houses that needed fixing. However, expensive video equipment
was delivered directly to Walker's home.

   _ $2,200 for a saltwater aquarium and accessories from Wet Pets.
   _ $21,000 was paid to High School Video Memories, a business
enterprise in which Walker hoped to sell video yearbooks to all high
school graduates in Alabama.
   Walker did not return a phone call made to the recording device
on his beeper telephone. The number listed for his residence phone
has been disconnected, and Walker has moved from the apartment
listed in the 1989 phone book.
   Montgomery Real Estate Commission records show that he still has
a valid real estate license, but it is listed as ``inactive status''
since he has not been associated with a real estate firm since Nov.
14, 1988.
   HUD officials declined to comment on the case because it is a
matter under investigation.
   The FBI has turned its investigative file over to the U.S.
attorney for possible prosecution. U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson said he
will meet with HUD officials this month to discuss possible criminal
indictments.
   HUD, which completed its audit in September 1988, is trying to
recover the money through administrative procedures.
   Walker won the HUD contract to handle sales of HUD's
single-family dwellings in the Montgomery area through competitive
bidding. In 1984, he handled the HUD work while he was an associate
broker for Rick's Lind-Davis Real Estate Inc. The firm was sold in
1986 to Johnny M. Portis, who folded the business last year when the
HUD trouble surfaced. His attorney said Portis was not aware of what
Walker was doing with the HUD money.
   Dave Gordon, a First Alabama executive familiar with the HUD
case, said he could not comment on any specific allegations. But he
said it appears that ``from all the indications from HUD, from a
regulation standpoint, First Alabama has done nothing wrong, nothing
out of the ordinary.''
   A Nov. 9, 1987, memo from Robert E. Lunsford, at the time the
acting manager of HUD's Birmingham office, told the regional
administrator that a bank employee gave Walker ``a blank stack of
the wire transfer authorization forms'' so that Walker ``could have
them typed prior to his visit and thus save the bank employee some
work.''
   ``This is a closely controlled form of the bank and it is our
understanding that the Security Department of the bank is very upset
over this action,'' the memo said.
   It said the wire transfer authorization forms sent to HUD from
Walker's sales closings were all drawn on First Alabama and ``appear
to be signed by a non-existent bank employee.''
   According to the memo, the forms led HUD's Birmingham office to
believe that the bank had wired the money properly to the Office of
Finance and Accounting in the agency's central office. At the time,
the agency had no procedure in place to check whether it had
received the money or not.
   Such a procedure, according to Lunsford's memo, was adopted when
the problems with the Montgomery account were uncovered in October
1987.
   Before uncovering the Montgomery problems, wrote Lunsford, ``we
felt very secure in following normal operating procedures which to
some degree assumes that you are dealing with honest people.''

<TEXT>
   Janos Kadar, Hungary's leader from the
repression of 1956 through the liberalized ``goulash communism'' of
the 1970s until his removal last year as a relic of the rigid past,
died Thursday at age 77.
   ``The era Kadar represented we were already burying while he was
still alive,'' a commentator said on state radio.
   That era began in October 1956, when Kadar took over the
Communist Party and summoned Soviet tanks to crushed the
anti-Stalinist uprising led by Premier Imre Nagy.
   Nagy was executed in 1958. Liberal new Hungarian leaders reburied
him with honors this spring, and a few hours after Kadar's death the
Supreme Court exonerated Nagy of all charges, completing his
rehabilitation.
   A statement carried by the official news agency MTI announced
``with deep shock and profound sorrow'' that Kadar had died Thursday
``after a prolonged, serious illness.'' He was hospitalized Monday
with pneumonia and breathing and circulatory problems.
   Kadar was reported gravely ill in April and in May lost his two
remaining posts: honorary party chairman and member of the Central
Committee, which wrote him a letter criticizing ``erroneous
decisions'' during his long rule.
   He responded in a letter, his last public statement, that he
always acted in Hungary's best interests of his country but had made
``mistakes.''
   A statement from the party leadership Thursday emphasized both
Kadar's success with cautious reform and the later years
characterized by economic stagnation and growing discontent over
stalled reforms.
   It said his declaration to a workers' rally in 1962 that ``those
who are not against us are with us'' led to ``a national consensus;
which is not to say that there were no mistakes and painful
retreats, but Janos Kadar's name came to be synonymous with humanist
socialism.''
   The four members of the Communist Party Presidium, led by party
chairman Rezso Nyers, were named as a committee to organize the
funeral. The official news agency MTI said the date and place would
be announced later.
   Nyers and Premier Miklos Nemeth left for Romania to attend a
Warsaw Pact summit beginning Friday, prompting speculation that the
funeral would be delayed until after President George Bush's visit
to Hungary next week.
   Black flags flew on all public buildings in Budapest and state
radio played classical music. Television broadcast short
documentaries of Kadar's life throughout the day.
   Since Karoly Grosz replaced Kadar as party chief in May 1988, the
former leader has come under fierce attack and the new leadership
has moved rapidly to embrace democratic change, promising contested
elections and a multi-party system.
   Representatives of the party and opposition have begun
negotiations on holding the first open elections since the
Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   Liberal policies put forth by the new leaders are similar to
those endorsed in 1956 by Nagy, whom they describe as a forerunner
of Communist reform.
   Nagy's official status began to change this year when the party
declared the revolt was a popular uprising, not the
counterrevolution it had been called for 33 years.
   In a serialized interview with the weekly Magyarorszag after the
reburial, Kadar was quoted as saying: ``Nagy's tragedy is my own
personal tragedy as well.''
   Janos Kadar was born May 26, 1912, in the Adriatic port of Fiume,
which was renamed Rijeka and became part of Yugoslavia when the
Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up. He joined the illegal Communist
Party in 1931, as a 19-year-old of peasant stock with only eight
years of schooling.
   He achieved Central Committee membership in May 1942, having
spent more than three years in prison on various political charges.
   When the Communists took over, Kadar became interior minister in
Matyas Rakosi's Stalinist regime, but it was never clear whether he
controlled the feared political police.
   Rakosi had him arrested in 1951 on charges of espionage and
treason, but when Josef Stalin died in 1953, Rakosi's grip on power
began to slip. Kadar was freed and rehabilitated the next year.
   Growing discontent led to Rakosi's ouster in July 1956, but
dissatisfaction continued and a popular uprising began within three
months. Tens of thousands of students filled the streets, demanding
a free press, withdrawal of Soviet troops and multiparty politics.
   Kadar became party leader a few days later. On Nov. 3, he asked
the Kremlin to help end the revolt and the Red Army moved in.
   Less than four months after Nagy's death, Kadar embarked on
economic reform that brought growing prosperity and increasingly
cordial ties with the West.
   He was a reticent man, fond of chess, reading and hunting.
   Of hunting, Kadar said once: ``If you enter a wood even as much
as a meter, speech stops. You don't make a noise. You don't talk in
the woods. There is silence. That is why I like it.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today offered additional and rapid cuts in his country's nuclear
arsenal if NATO accepts negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons.
   Gorbachev's proposal, contained in a speech to the Council of
Europe's assembly in this eastern French city, appeared designed to
increase pressure on the United States to agree to the talks, an
issue that caused a deep rift in the Western alliance that was
patched over last month.
   ``If it became clear that NATO countries are ready to join us in
negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons, we could, naturally, after
consulting our allies, carry out without delay further unilateral
reductions in our tactical nuclear missiles in Europe,'' Gorbachev
told the assembly, which contains parliamentarians from 23 Western
European democracies.
   Gorbachev did not say how many missiles the Soviets would cut.
   President Bush reacted to the proposal by noting that NATO
leaders agreed not to entertain such talks until an accord is
reached on conventional forces. ``I don't want to get off track'' by
reopening the issue of short-range nuclear forces that Western
leaders agreed to in Brussels, Bush said in Washington.
   Earlier today, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
the Gorbachev statement had been anticipated.
   ``We welcome any unilateral reductions'' in the Soviet's nuclear
arsenal, Fitzwater said. But he added that the Bush administration
would stand by its own proposal on East-West force reductions in
Europe.
   NATO last month agreed to link any future negotiations on
tactical nuclear arms to results obtained at the Vienna talks
seeking Europe-wide reductions in conventional weaponry, a step the
Soviets have said will cause delay.
   Gorbachev's announcement, made from the podium at the ultramodern
Palace of Europe, seemed designed to force a break in that link.
   As presented at the NATO summit in Brussels, Bush's plan calls
for a reduction in conventional forces in Europe to 275,000 troops
apiece for NATO and Warsaw Pact nations before talks are held on
reducing short-range missiles.
   An attempt by the Soviet Union to seek earlier talks ``was the
reaction we expected from the Soviets,'' Fitzwater said. ``Our
position remains the same as before: to do the conventional talks
first.''
   ``NATO has its posture established,'' Fitzwater said,
conventional arms reductions first. ``I wouldn't anticipate any
change in that.''
   In Bonn, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
praised the speech as an ``impressive declaration of belief in
Europe'' that ``embraced the basic values of European culture and
civilization.''
   Most of NATO's weapons are based in West Germany.
   In his 45-minute speech, Gorbachev also:
   _Said the social and political order in Europe could change, the
furthest he has gone in suggesting that the Kremlin would one day be
ready to tolerate multiparty democracies in its eastern allies.
   _Proposed a series of projects both Eastern and Western Europeans
could take part in, including a high-speed railway spanning the
continent, an all-European TV satellite system, and a program for
processing and storing nuclear wastes and improving nuclear power
plant safety.
   The Soviet leader, on the final day of a three-day visit to
France, said he couldn't understand why Europeans would want
tactical nuclear arms to remain on their home continent.
   ``Only Europeans, who have no intention of waging war against one
another, are threatened by those weapons,'' Gorbachev said.
   In May, when U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III visited
Moscow, Gorbachev announced the Soviets would unilaterally eliminate
500 tactical nuclear warheads.
   NATO specialists, however, said the Soviet offer represented only
a fraction of the Red Army's tactical nuclear weapons. Soviets have
acknowleged they had a 12-to-1 advantage in shorter-range nuclear
missiles, those with a range of 300 miles.
   The announcement in May came as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization was embroiled in a dispute about tactical nuclear
forces. The United States, West Germany and Britain were brawling
over whether to modernize or trade away NATO's few remaining
short-range missiles, those with a range of up to 300 miles.
   Under the NATO compromise, West Germany won an agreement that
bargaining with the Soviets on tactical weapons would begin, but not
until conventional arms reductions are under way _ 1992 at the
earliest.
   Britain and the United States held fast for agreement that such
talks would concentrate on a partial reduction of U.S. and Soviet
warheads, and not, as the West Germans wanted, on their complete
elimination.
   Gorbachev flew this morning to Strasbourg from Paris, where he
held a last meeting with President Francois Mitterrand. He was to
leave later today for Bucharest, Romania for a Warsaw Pact summit.
   In a statement issued at a joint news conference Wednesday,
Gorbachev and Mitterand appealed for an immediate cease-fire in
Lebanon and a halt in arms deliveries to Lebanese groups involved in
the conflict.
   Mitterrand also said on Wednesday that France's nuclear arsenal
is so much smaller than those of the Soviet Union and the United
States that it should not be included in arms reduction talks.
   On another topic, Gorbachev said on Wednesday that he is prepared
to meet with Solidarity's leaders and that he thinks democratization
based on free elections should not be confined in the East bloc to
Hungary and Poland.
   He also said the Soviet Union would accept governments in Eastern
Europe that are no longer dominated by the Communist Party.
   ``The right to free election ... is of vital importance,'' he
said.
   The countries Moscow dominated by threat of force for most of the
postwar period are now in transition, moving toward a kind of
socialist democracy, Gorbachev said.
   But he rejected any suggestions that communism is in a worldwide
crisis or decline, and said no one should believe ``that we will
renounce our values, that we will renounce socialism.''

   Sir?
   Q: Yes, Mr. President, despite your recent success at the NATO
summit, Mr. Gorbachev seems to have enjoyed far greater popularity
in Western Europe than you do. Why do you think that is, and what
can you do about it?
   Bush: You know something? I don't really care about that. I'm not
interested in that. I am delighted that he enjoys popularity in
Europe. I am delighted when he goes to Germany. I am pleased when he
goes to France. It is good for world peace that he takes those
trips, and I expect he will be delighted when I go to Poland and
when I go to Hungary, for we will be well received in those
countries. So we shouldn't view the relationships between East and
West, or between the United States and the Soviet Union on who seems
to be popular at the moment. We're not going to get into the
international poll business _ even though I read with keen interest
a recent poll taken by the US Information Agency or somebody of that
nature pointing out that the standing of the United States _ I'll
try to be modest _ was pretty darn good in Europe following the NATO
summit. But I would make a tremendous mistake as president of the
United States if I was concerned about Mr. Gorbachev's popularity
vis-a-vis my own in terms of some poll. It's irrelevant. What's
important is how are we going to handle these major questions that
we're asked here _ arms control, or economic recovery, and freedom
and democracy in Eastern Europe? These are the questions.
   And I might add parenthetically, you mentioned those figures, or
standings _ I don't know whether you're accurate or not _ but even
if they are, it doesn't mean I ought to go to Eastern Europe to try
to go one up, try to establish a popularity level in Poland or
Hungary. That's not what sound foreign policy is about. We want to
see these countries in Eastern Europe move more down the road toward
democracy, down the road toward freedom. And so, I have to resist
getting into _ into this popularity thing, other than to say I'm
pleased, and I mean it. I am very pleased that his standing is good
in Europe, because that enables us then, to work not only
bilaterally, but through NATO and the Pact to improve things for the
people. So it doesn't really concern me.
   Q: Mr. President, Solidarity has asked for Western aid of some
$10 billion over three years to fend off what they call ``economic
disaster.'' Is there any realistic propect of the Paris summit
coming up with that kind of sum from the West?
   Bush: I do not want to go into sums, but I doubt that there will
be an instant grant of any $10 billion. But the summit, the G-7,
will be addressing itself, themselves, to this concept of what do we
do to help economic recovery? But I said, in these countries, as I
said in my opening statement, though, I think there is a _ must be a
_ recognition on the part of the Solidarnosc leaders and the part of
the government leaders from all stripes in Poland, that economic
reform is essential if the West, through multilateral institutions
or bilaterally, can do its, do its upmost. The economic reform is
essential if we're going to be able to help the way we'd like. But I
haven't heard the $10 billion figure that, from Solidarnosc, but I
don't want to raise expectations by saying I think we can achieve
such a number, something of that nature.
   Q: May I follow up?
   Bush: Please.

   With a Soviet inspection team looking on,
the U.S. Army destroyed the last of its Pershing 1A missiles
Thursday, the first time an entire class of American nuclear weapons
has been eliminated.
   The ground shook at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant as white
flames and smoke poured from the 169th Pershing 1A to be destroyed
under provisions of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   The treaty, signed in 1987 by President Reagan and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, requires elimination of 859 U.S.
intermediate-range and shorter range missiles and 1,752 similar
Soviet missiles within three years.
   The final 5,500-pound Pershing 1A, strapped on its side to
reinforced stands, was destroyed in two ignitions _ one for each of
two rocket motors.
   The first burn lasted about 40 seconds and consumed one rocket
stage. A half-minute later the second stage was fired for another 40
seconds. The more powerful of the two rocket motors carried enough
propellant to hurtle a 3,000-pound car about 150 miles in 45 seconds.
   Some of the Soviet observers watched the operation from a
concrete bunker near the firing site. Another contingent was about
1,000 feet away in a second observation area.
   Gen. Maj. Vladimir Medved'ev, director of the Soviet Nuclear Risk
Reduction Center, watched the firing through binoculars. ``This has
been possible due to the new political thinking,'' he said. ``This
is a major step in the direction of peace.''
   The general presented American officials with a small sculpture
of a Soviet missile destroyed under the treaty.
   ``We all should be mindful that the completion of the destruction
of the Pershing 1A system is proof positive that we have moved
forward in our relationship with the Soviet Union,'' said Maj. Gen.
Marvin D. Brailsford, commander of the U.S. Army Armament, Munitions
and Chemical Command in Rock Island, Ill.
   The spent missile sections were crushed after they cooled.
   The missiles marked for destruction, which have a range of 300 to
3,400 miles, are not armed. Nuclear warheads and electronic guidance
systems were removed, with the warheads stored by the Department of
Energy.
   Thursday's operation, 10 months after the first Pershing 1A was
destroyed at Longhorn, was conducted by Utah-based Thiokol Inc.,
which built many of the Pershing motors at Longhorn.
   The Pershing program began in 1958, with the upgrade to the
Pershing 1A 11 years later. Larger Pershing 2 missiles will continue
to be destroyed under terms of the INF treaty. Officials say nine of
the complete missiles already have been scrapped at Longhorn, with
another 234 heading to the junk heap.
   The Soviets began destruction of several classes of similar
missiles a year ago.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Strikes Down Fetal Disposal Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has struck down a 1987
Minnesota law requiring dignified and sanitary disposal of aborted
or miscarried fetuses, saying the law could interfere with a woman's
right to have an abortion.
   By elevating the status of a fetus to that of a person or a human
body, the law creates a psychological burden similar to those found
unconstitutional in other states, Judge David Doty said in a
decision released last Friday.
   Doty also said the law was unclear about how to dispose of fetal
remains.
   ``It appears substantially likely that the statute is so vague
that persons charged with enforcement of the statute are left free
to react to their own preferences, thereby trapping those who desire
to be law-abiding and acting without fair notice of the conduct that
is considered unlawful,'' Doty said.
   The judge noted that lawmakers drafting the law had been unable
to agree on what type of disposal would be considered dignified.
   ``Some legislators stated that group burial or cremation would
not be dignified while others assumed that a dignified burial or
cremation need not be individual,'' he wrote.
   Disposal of fetal remains became an issue after fetal parts
allegedly were found in a dumpster behind a clinic and displayed by
anti-abortion activists.
   The law was scheduled to go into effect Aug. 1, 1987, but Planned
Parenthood of Minnesota and Dr. Mildred Hanson filed a lawsuit in
July of that year attempting to block it. Restraining orders
previously issued by Doty kept the law from being enforced.
   Planned Parenthood argued that the law suggested to women that an
abortion is to be equated with taking a human life, which would
interfere with their right to an abortion by making the abortion
decision psychologically more disturbing.
   The state said the law would not unduly interfere with a woman's
abortion decision.
   The state argued that it was not equating fetal remains with a
dead person but was acknowledging that a fetus is different from
other human anatomical tissues because it has the potential to
develop into a human being. Doty rejected that argument.
   He also said that requiring individual treatment of fetuses could
increase the cost of an abortion by at least $40.
   ``Although to many seeking an abortion a $40 increase may seem
insignificant, but for a woman on welfare or for an unemployed
teen-ager, this additional cost may put the cost of an abortion
beyond reach and become a direct burden,'' Doty said.
   Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III said Wednesday
that a decision on an appeal has not yet been made. However, he
said, ``I assume we will appeal that.''

   Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi said Thursday his forces and government troops both have
violated a June 24 cease-fire, but he said this should not stop
talks to end the war.
   Savimbi, leader of UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, signed an agreement with the Luanda
government June 22 in Gbadolite, Zaire, to begin peace negotiations.
   The agreement included a truce in the 14-year guerrilla war.
   But Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has suspended the
peace talks because of guerilla violations of the cease-fire.
   ``That there have been attacks froavimbi's decision to accept the Gbadolite
agreement has earned
him a legitimacy he did not know during the war. He was photographed
at the Zaire summit with several African leaders whose governments
had called his guerrillas puppets of South Africa.
   And although Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny had quietly
supported Savimbi's calls for national reconciliation in the former
Portuguese colony, the Angolan guerrilla leader had never appeared
publicly in the Ivory Coast before Thursday's news conference.
   In the past, the guerrilla leader arranged to fly reporters into
his stronghold in southeastern Angola.
   Savimbi agreed to absent himself from direct participation in the
peace negotiations, but he made it clear suggestions he go into
exile are out of the question.
   He said if exile had even been suggested he would not have
attended the summit.
   ``I do not think there are any grounds for discussing exile or
integration because it is not going to happen at all,'' Savimbi said.
   He said his movement's goal remains free national elections,
which dos Santos rejects, and suggested Africa learn from the
democracy process in some Eastern European countries.
   ``We do not think that the one-party system is good,'' Savimbi
said. ``Africa also is going to make progress. You see what is
happening in Poland and Hungary ... let us just do it now,'' he said.

   Christians and Syrians broke a two-day
lull in their long artillery war Thursday and traffic dissolved in a
din of blaring horns as shells rained on Beirut during the morning
rush hour.
   Police said five people were killed and 13 wounded, bringing the
total to 402 dead and 1,551 wounded since the battle began March 8
between Christian army units and a Moslem alliance of Druse
militiamen and Syrian soldiers.
   Panicky motorists sped away in all directions and pedestrians
rushed to bomb shelters to escape shells and rockets that began
falling at 8 a.m. on Moslem west Beirut and on the city's eastern
sector, where Christians live.
   Vegetable vendors abandoned their stalls and sought refuge in
building entrances when a shell crashed into the main street of
Karakon, a Druse district of west Beirut.
   The whoosh of rockets, thunder of shells and wail of ambulance
sirens filled the air across the battered city. Steel shutters
slammed down on shops and banks.
   As abruptly as it began, the battle subsided at 9:30 a.m. and
settled into what has become a daily pattern: the intermittent thud
of shells fired by the Syrians at the Christian-held coast north of
Beirut.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the Arab League,
drove into west Beirut from Syria just before the shooting stopped,
to meet with Lebanese leaders about how to end one of the worst
episodes in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   He spent 90 minutes with acting Premier Salim Hoss, who heads a
Moslem cabinet vying for power with that of Gen. Michel Aoun,
commander of the Christian forces fighting the Syrians and Druse.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, refused to speak with reporters after
conferring with Hoss and crossed the city's sectarian dividing line
to meet with Aoun in the shattered presidential palace at Baabda, a
Christian suburb.
   Police said Syrian howitzers in north Lebanon opened fire briefly
at about noon on a small freighter carrying food supplies to Byblos,
a Christian-run port 19 miles north of Beirut, but the ship docked
without damage.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command said the Syrians provoked
Thursday's battle by firing before dawn at towns in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of Beirut.
   Before the latest artillery duel began, Presidents Mikhail S.
Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Francois Mitterrand of France
urged that both sides observe a cease-fire and said arms deliveries
to warring Lebanese factions should be halted.
   They issued a joint statement during Gorbachev's visit to France.
   On Wednesday, press reports said Syria had demanded Aoun remove
medium-range missiles, capable of reaching Damascus, that his forces
were said to have received from Iraq.
   Asked whether such missiles had been delivered, Aoun's spokesman
said Thursday: ``If so, then their withdrawal is linked to the
Syrian pullout from Lebanon.'' He refused to elaborate.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate
issued by the Arab League in 1976, the year after the civil war
began. Early in the 4-month-old artillery war, Aoun said the Syrians
were an occupation force and he was fighting a ``war of liberation.''

   A 13-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and
killed in the Askar refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on
Thursday when soldiers on patrol opened fire, Arab reports said.
   The teen-ager was identified as Aiman Badran, and doctors at
Al-Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said he was dead on arrival with a
bullet in the head.
   The army spokesman's office said it had no information about the
case.
   No major clashes were reported in the camp on Thursday, and it
was not known why the soldiers opened fire, Arab reporters in Nablus
said.
   Also Thursday, two Palestinians died of wounds suffered in
earlier clashes with Israeli troops, and soldiers took 16 Arabs into
custody in continuing security sweeps in the occupied West Bank.
   One of the victims was identified as 18-year-old Hassam Hamad of
the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. He was shot
in the head on Wednesday in a stone-throwing confrontation with
soldiers and died at Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv, the army
said.
   The other victim was identifed as 30-year-old Awni Sawalhah of
the West Bank village of Assira Shamaliya, who died at Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem, family members said.
   Sawalhah, an ambulance driver for the Friends of the Patients
Society, was transporting the body of a Palestinian killed in a
clash with soldiers on June 18 when troops opened fire on his
ambulance, hitting him in the lower back, hospital officials said.
   The society, an Arab charitable organization, filed a formal
protest with the army over the shooting.
   The three deaths raised to at least 546 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories began 19 months ago. Twenty-three Israelis also
have died.
   The toll of Israelis was likely to rise after police released the
names of victims in Thursday's bus crash.
   At least 14 people were killed and 27 injured after a bus plunged
off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway when a Palestinian grabbed the
steering wheel and forced it off the road, police said.
   Most of the casualties are believed to be Israelis, but the
injured include at least 7 Americans, a Canadian and a Spanish woman.
   An army sweep of the Jalazun refugee camp near the West Bank town
of Ramallah resulted in the arrest of 16 suspected leaders of the
uprising, the army said.
   The arrests raised to about 300 the number of Palestinian
activists taken into custody in search-and-arrest operations that
began last Sunday.
   The army has said the detainees were suspected of membership in
``popular committees,'' which organize Palestinian resistance, and
``strike forces,'' which enforce strikes and boycotts called by the
underground leadership of the uprising.
   The army announced it demolished three houses and sealed three
others Thursday to punish Palestinians accused of attacks on
Israelis or on Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   The houses were in the areas of Nablus, Jenin and Qalqilya in the
West Bank, the army said.

   China's government and Communist Party officials
face a long summer.
   Their summer vacations have been canceled by order of the party
Central Committee and the State Council, China's cabinet, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday.
   The order, which Xinhua described as ``an urgent announcement,''
was made ``to promote hard work and plain living, and recover the
losses caused by the recent turmoil and counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
   Chinese from all walks of life participated in the seven-week
movement for democracy. Factory production dropped and other
business operations were interrupted as employees in Beijing and
other large cities took to the streets.
   The order said party and government employees at every level
would be affected, and the only holidays to be taken are those set
by the state.
   Work units were ordered not to give compensation, in money or
goods, for the lost vacations, and those who violate the order will
be disciplined, the order said.

<HEAD>Thirty Americans to Join Korean March</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30 Americans are planning to participate
in a peninsula-wide peace march in Korea, according to organizers
who said Thursday the event could spark retaliation from South
Korean government leaders.
   The Americans will meet 100 people from 16 countries, then divide
up for simultaneous marches through South Korea and communist North
Korea, according to organizers.
   ``We feel a special responsibility to participate in this
historic march because it is the presence of 43,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea that is the primary obstacle to overcoming the cruel
division of Korea, which is a legacy of World War II and the cold
war that followed,'' said Channing Liem, former South Korean
ambassador to the United Nations and now a U.S. citizen.
   Jihoon Lee of the Young Koreans United said many fear that those
marching through South Korea may be ``violently suppressed,'' given
the ``current repressive climate.''
   Lee and Liem pointed to the recent arrest of hundreds of leading
student and trade union activists after a visit by South Korean
clergyman Moon Ik Hwan to North Korea.
   The peace march is part of the International Peace and
Reunification Study Tour of Korea. Participants will travel through
many towns, villages, and cities to talk with residents and visit
their workplaces, schools, and community centers.
   Besides the estimated 30 Americans, other participants will come
from Australia, the Philippines, Latin America, Africa, Europe and
the Asia-Pacific Region for the July 20 event.
   A demilitarized zone dividing Korea originally was created as
part of a temporary truce agreement. Organizers said marchers will
call for a permanent peace pact.
   In the past, the South Korean government has mobilized prevented
marchers supporting reunification from reaching the zone, Lee said.
   Whit Hutchison, a Methodist minister and educator, said the march
should call attention to the international power politics being
played in that country.
   ``For the entire period of my life, Americans have been deeply
implicated in a divided and militarized Korea,'' said Hutchison.
   Susan Bailey of the People's Anti-War Mobilization, also
criticized the role of the United States in Korea. Last year, Bailey
was arrested during a visit to South Korea and deported.

<HEAD>North Korea Says Moon Must Be Released as Condition for Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) </DATELINE>

   A senior government official said
Thursday that stalled talks with South Korea cannot resume unless
Seoul frees a dissident clergyman who was jailed for visiting North
Korea.
   ``The South Korean authorities must release the Rev. Moon
Ik-hwan,'' Chon Kum Chol, vice chairman of the Commission for the
Reunification of the Fatherland, said at a news conference. ``If he
is released, all the talks will be resumed between the North and the
South.''
   Chon also said future talks could be jeopardized if South Korea
arrests Im Su-kyong, a 20-year-old student who also defied a Seoul
ban on travel to North Korea to attend an international youth
festival.
   He said that if Miss Im, like Moon, is arrested upon her return,
``it will b will be a great challenge and we will regard it as a
great obstacle to North-South dialogue.''
   Moon, a leading critic of the South Korea government of President
Roh Tae-woo, was detained after a visit to North Korea in March in
which he held lengthy talks with North Korean President Kim Il Sung
on possible Korean reunification.
   Chon said the South Korean National Security Law, which bans
unauthorized trips to North Korea, is ``the worst evil law.''
   The two nations, divided since 1945, resumed direct talks last
fall, with seven meetings of lawmakers discussing steps toward a
non-aggression pact and other tension-easing measures.
   Talks also were held early this year on preparing for a meeting
of the two nations' prime ministers and on organizing a joint team
for the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing.
   But North Korea suspended the parliamentary talks in February to
protest the annual U.S.-South Korean ``Team Spirit'' military
maneuvers, and the other talks were called off in April after Moon's
arrest.
   Chon accused the South of ``raising a frantic anti-communist,
anti-North clamor'' after the Moon trip and said the Roh government
had made no proposals for reunification.
   ``Confrontation between the North and the South is now quite
acute,'' he said.
   Chon said North Korea had proposed Red Cross talks on Aug. 15 on
reuniting divided families. He did not list the Red Cross talks,
last held in 1985, among the dialogues that will be affected by the
Moon case.
   Chon also indicated that North Korea would be willing to hold
meaningful talks with the United States if the joint military
maneuvers are suspended.
   ``Everything depends on the United States,'' he said. ``If they
show a change in attitude, we may be willing to reciprocate.''
   North Korea says the presence of 43,000 U.S. troops in South
Korea is the main obstacle to easing tensions. It has proposed a
phased withdrawal of U.S. troops by 1991, to be accompanied by a
reduction of both North and South Korean forces.

<HEAD>Film Found in Late Beatle's Rolls Royce Still a Mystery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SURREY, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exhaustive research has failed to
clear up the mystery of a home movie found under a seat in John
Lennon's psychedelic Rolls Royce.
   As a result, officials at the Transportation Museum of British
Columbia have released the uneven, heavily spliced film, shot in
1970 in the Beacon Hill area of Boston.
   ``What we can do now is let it go to the public,'' said museum
development officer Fred Davies. ``With positive identification of
people (in the film), then maybe we'll get some more information.''
   The biggest mystery is ``how did the film get into John Lennon's
Rolls Royce?'' Davies said Wednesday. ``That is the magic question.''
   The 28-minute home movie shows several young men and women in
their late teens or early 20s smoking a hookah, or water pipe,
followed by several surreal images of a church, a television cartoon
show and numerous wine bottles.
   ``Maybe they're trying to depict what happens after you smoke
this thing, who knows,'' Davies mused while showing the film to
reporters.
   Another highlight is footage of a total eclipse of the sun as
seen in New England on March 7, 1970, along with a peace
demonstration attended by the young people and Boston police
equipped with riot gear.
   The 8mm color movie was found in November under a passenger seat
in the late Beatle's 1965 Phantom V Rolls Royce, which Lennon had
painted with flowers, scrolls and zodiac signs.
   Vancouver millionaire Jim Pattison bought the car for $2.3
million at an auction in 1985 and brought it to British Columbia for
display at the Expo 86 world's fair. Pattison later donated the
vehicle to the province, and it has become the top attraction and
publicity generator for the museum.
   Museum researchers have failed to turn up more information on the
film, and Davies suggested that the filmmaker and participants might
be keeping quiet to preserve their reputations.
   ``We've had a few dead ends,'' he said. ``Maybe 20 years later
they might be senators or presidents of corporations.''

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Rejects Another Candidate for Senior Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature on Thursday refused to
confirm the first deputy chairman of the nation's highest court
because he was an official in the period before ``perestroika,''
Tass reported.
   The official news agency said the Supreme Soviet voted against
Sergei I. Gusev by a count of 162-127, with 73 abstentions, because
he ``was a prominent figure in the judicial system in the period
before perestroika'' _ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
political and economic restructuring.
   ``Gusev's excessively emotional remarks also seemed to have
played a negative role,'' Tass added, without elaborating.
   There has been a substantial turnover in senior government and
Communist Party personnel since Gorbachev began his policy of
restructuring. The latest step has allowed the legislature to vote
on Cabinet and other senior level posts.
   Gusev, who assumed the number two spot on the Soviet Supreme
Court in 1979, was the latest in a string of senior officials whose
nominations have been turned down.
   The legislature confirmed five incumbent Cabinet members, the
news agency said.
   The parliament suspended its consideration of government
nominations Thursday because Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was leaving
for Romania. He and Gorbachev are to attend a meeting of the Warsaw
Pact consultative committee.
   While turning down Gusev, the legislature approved the
nominations of two junior members of the Supreme Court, Aleksandr M.
Filatov, 66, who had held the post of deputy chairman since last
December, and Robert G. Tikhomirnov, 61, who has been sitting on the
21-member court since April 12, 1984.
   The Cabinet nominees who were approved were:
   _ Vladimir M. Velichko, 52, minister of heavy machine-building.
Velichko has held that post since July 20, 1987, and has been a
member of the Communist Party Central Committee since March 6, 1986.
   _ Mikhail I. Shchadov, 62, coal minister. He has held his post
since Dec. 15, 1985, and has been a member of the Central Committee
since March 6, 1986.
   _ Nikolai Lamayev, 60, minister of the chemical and oil refining
industries. Tass did not report when he took office.
   _ Vladislav G. Kolesnikov, 64, minister of electronics
industries. He has held his post since Nov. 18, 1985, has been a
member of the Central Committee since March 6, 1986, and has served
on the Central Committee Commission on Socio-economic Policy since
October.
   _ Oleg G. Anfimov, 52, minister of electro-technical industries.
Tass provided no further information on him.

<HEAD>Gov't Set to Crush Extremists with Censorship; Shoot on Sight Orders</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: This report was submitted to a government censor, but no changes

<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government extended tough
censorship laws to foreign media Thursday and gave security forces
shoot-on-sight powers in moves to crush Sinhalese extremism.
   All public meetings and trade union rallies have been banned in
the crackdown, Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratna told reporters.
   The latest victims of the militant left-wing extremists are seven
people killed Wednesday, including three men accused of supporting
the government and two Moslems whose bodies were left hanging from a
coconut tree, police said.
   The government blames the extremists for the deaths of at least
3,500 people in southern Sri Lanka, where they have fought for two
years to overthrow the government. Most victims are government
officials or supporters of Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa's
governing party.
   ``We will not allow the government to be displaced by gun-toting
criminals,'' Wijeratna told reporters. ``Our armed forces and police
have been given wide powers to deal with all forms of subversion in
the most ruthless manner.''
   He said this includes powers to shoot on sight people involved in
violence or putting up anti-government posters.
   The government says the extremists, from the People's Liberation
Front, also instigated a four-week strike by transport workers that
is crippling the economy.
   On censorship, Wijeratna told reporters, ``I will cancel your
visas and deport you if you violate the censorship.''
   Foreign journalists initially were exempted from laws banning
reports on the radical Sinhalese movement that went into effect
Thursday morning.
   But Wijeratna said: ``No news whatsoever can go out of this
country without being censored. If you cannot conform to that,
please leave the country.''
   Local journalists who violate the laws will be jailed, he said.
   Militant Sinhalese began killing government supporters in July
1987 to protest peace overtures to Tamil rebels fighting since 1983
for an independent homeland in the northeast.
   Tamils are a mainly Hindu ethnic group and say they are
discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists and
comprise 75 percent of this island nation's 16 million people.
   Since May, the government has been holding peace talks with the
biggest Tamil rebel group, which initially rejected peace overtures
under a 1987 accord sponsored by neighboring India, but agreed last
month to a truce.
   However, the rebels continue to fight 40,000 Indian soldiers
deployed on the island to end the insurrection. New Delhi has
refused Colombo's request to withdraw its troops, saying the rebel
truce is a ruse and that they will continue fighting once Indian
troops withdraw.
   New Delhi also says a hasty pullout would lead to greater
bloodshed in the northeast, where 9,000 people, mostly Sinhalese,
have been killed.
   On Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi offered to discuss
a timetable for a gradual withdrawal.
   Wijeratna told reporters Thursday that his government will not
send an envoy to New Delhi. ``If India wants to sit down and talk
about the troop withdrawal, they will have to send somebody'' to
Colombo, he said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa says he would
accept any invitation to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, an opposition daily reported Thursday.
   The newspaper printed the remark one day after Gorbachev told a
news conference in Paris that he saw ``no obstacle'' to meet
eventually with representatives of the independent union. There
might be ``a possibility of a meeting with this organization
recognized by the Polish people,'' Gorbachev said.
   Asked by Gazeta Wyborcza whether he would accept such an
invitation, Walesa replied: ``I would go immediately.''
   Gorbachev visited Poland a year ago and made no contact with the
then-banned union. Solidarity was declared legal again in April.
   Adam Michnik, editor of the mass-circulation Gazeta Wyborcza and
a Walesa adviser, has developed a deep interest in Gorbachev's
reform policies, and senior Solidarity activists have started to
follow Soviet events as well.
   During a visit to Paris in October for a human rights conference,
Walesa had a long talk with Soviet human rights activist Andrei
Sakharov, like himself a Nobel Peace Prize winner.

   Q: Mr. President, Mr. Gorbachev has rejected your call for a
Soviet military withdrawal to withdraw from Poland as purely
propaganda. How do you plead to that? Is it a dead letter now, or
where do you go with it?
   Bush: I didn't know that he rejected it. I just thought he said
it was propaganda.
   Q: You don't take that as a rejection?
   Bush: Well, as a lack of enthusiasm, perhaps. (laughter). He
didn't say rejection. I mean, he's just taken trips out of Hungary.
And who would have said, two years ago, that that would happen? We
salute that. We think that is good. And so I'm not trying to
exacerbate problems for him in Poland. I think I was asked the
question, `Would you like to see the day when there are no troops in
Poland,' or something of that nature, and I said yes. But I, and he
viewed that as political. It's not political. It's a visceral
feeling I have on the question. I think it would be nice to aspire
to that kind of a situation where troops, he wouldn't feel troops
were necessary. Put it that way.
   And I would have a feeling that at some point the Polish people
might feel that way. But we're not trying to, as I say, make things
more difficult for him, just as when he goes to France and Germany I
don't think he's trying to make things more difficult for the United
States. We're in a very interesting period of change, and I have
said we want to see perestroika succeed and I want to see glasnost
succeed, and I'll repeat it here. And my trip over there is not to
try to _ through that statement or anything else _ drive wedges
between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. That's not what 1989
diplomacy is about. He's talking about a European home. And I'm
saying, `That's a good concept, but let's be sure a guy can move
from room to room. Let's be sure it's open. Let's be sure people can
move around in this home.'
   So we can discuss all these things, and I'm sorry he
misinterpreted or elected to characterize my view as, what you say,
`political,' but that doesn't change my view. And I don't expect it
changes the views of the people of Poland. But we're not going to be
there trying to, you know, raise tensions. We're going to be there
trying to help the Polish people, to encourage Poland towards
reform, to express the friendship and affection for Poland that
exists in a tremendous quantity here in the United States. And we
will be carefully, very carefully discussing these other
relationships, mainly, I might add, with our European partners, as
we did at the NATO summit. So, but, we'll see eye to eye on that;
it's going to take a little while.

   A public relations executive who testified
against Oliver L. North was placed on probation Thursday for
illegally using a tax-exempt foundation to raise donations for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Richard R. Miller was sentenced on his 1987 guilty plea to
conspiracy to defraud the Treasury by using a tax-exempt foundation
to raise $3.2 million for the non-deductible purpose of buying
armaments for the Contras.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris placed Miller on two-years'
probation and ordered him to perform 120 hours of community service.
   Harris, noting that Miller had already suffered many adversities
as a result of his guilty plea, said ``I need not impose more for
justice to be served.''
   Miller, who cooperated with independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair, could have been
sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to $250,000.
   ``I let my guard down. It may have been blind patriotism, but
that's no excuse,'' Miller told Harris. Helping the Contras ``was a
cause that meant everything to me and in that fervor I turned a
blind eye to the excesses of others and I crossed the line myself.''
   Prosecutors made no sentencing recommendation, but noted in court
pleadings that Miller had cooperated with their investigation of the
private foundation that raised some $10 million for the Contras when
U.S. military aid was banned by Congress.
   After the sentencing, associate independent counsel David Zornow
said Miller ``came forward at a very early stage of the
investigation to admit his wrongdoing, pleaded guilty to a very
serious charge and agreed to cooperate with the government.''
   ``He lived up to his agreement with the government,'' Zornow
said. ``This closes the chapter on Mr. Miller.''
   Miller and Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channell, who is scheduled to be
sentenced Friday for his guilty plea to the same tax conspiracy
charge, both testified that North was part of the conspiracy to
raise money through the tax-exempt National Endowment for the
Preservation of Liberty.
   North was acquitted of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury that
convicted him trying to cover up the Iran-Contra affair and
accepting a home security system.
   On Wednesday, North was fined $150,000, placed on two-years'
probation and ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service.
   Miller, who raised money and helped move it to off-shore bank
accounts for distribution to the Contras, testified that North let
him take a 10 percent of the money he handled as his cut.
   Alluding to North's sentence, defense attorney Earl C. Dudley Jr.
said imprisoning Miller would be unfair because of the treatment of
others more seriusly involved in the Iran-Contra affair.
   In another reference to North, Dudley said that during the
lengthy investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, Miller ``never
once turned to a paper shredder, he never once turned to the option
of lying.''
   Miller is the third person to be sentenced for his involvement in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane was placed on
probation on March 3 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges
of withholding information from Congress about the secret
arms-supply network.
   Still pending are cases against John W. Poindexter, McFarlane's
successor as national security advise,r who is awaiting trial on
felony charges of obstructing Congress and making false statements.
   Also awaiting trial are arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert
Hakim, who are charged with conspiring to pay illegal gratuities to
North.
   They are accused of arranging to install a $13,800 security
system outside North's house and setting up a $200,000 Swiss bank
account for North's family.
   Former CIA agent Joseph F. Fernandez is scheduled to stand trial
July 24 on charges he lied to the CIA and the presidential
commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair about his role
setting up an airstrip on Costa Rica for the arms resupply operation.
   No trial dates have been set for Poindexter and Hakim. Secord's
trial is tentatively set for Nov. 13.

   This is the last one, the moving last question. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, don't you feel that there is a problem because
the president in Poland has not been elected yet, and you arrive
without meeting a chief of state there?
   Bush: Slight complication, but no. That's a Polish affair. That's
a matter for Poland to decide. That's not a matter for the United
States to say, `I'm not going there until you have this all
ironclad, worked out.' It's not our business. We will deal with the
Polish leadership. And it complicates it _ I think your question's a
very good one _ and knowing what Mr. Jaruzelski's plans may be with
finality. But we'll have good discussions there with whoever our
interlocutors are, because we are not trying to sort out those
internal developments. That's not the role of the President of the
United States. My role is along the lines of my answer to my last
question, to extend to them whatever help we can; to tell them we
identify with reform and political openness; to salute the fact that
Solidarnosc, which was outlawed when I was in Poland not so many
months ago, is now legal; and to see how we can work with them as
they move forward toward more reform and more openness. So, I have
to deal with what's there, with who is there, and do it with
respect, and not look like, `Well, if you don't have all your
internal political matters sorted out as you begin this march down
democracy's road, well, we won't come to Poland.' I mean, I'm going
to deal with who's over there, and I salute them.
   It takes, these are difficult changes that they sort out, who's
going to stand for president and who's not. We've got to understand
that in this country. I mean, we've taken a long, long time to get
to where we are in terms of the stability that comes from elections
every four years. But we can't impose or say, `If you don't agree
with us on this formulation that we're going to hold back or be
reluctant to discuss with you the political situation, with whoever
you tell us, say, is going to come meet me or deal with it.' I
really am looking forward to that. I'm looking forward to our trip
to Hungary very, very much.
   And for those of you who may be new here, the affection for
Poland and the affection for Hungary in all our communities in the
United States is really high, it's really strong. And if I can do
nothing else but explain that and say, `We want you to succeed in
these changes,' that visit will be worthwhile even if they haven't
sorted out their internal political situations, with every `t'
crossed and every `i' dotted. It's going to be a good trip.
   Thank you all very much.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Trounces New Party in Low Turnout Poll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGUS SHAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe's socialist party
won a parliamentary by-election by a clear margin and trounced a new
political party committed to Western-style democracy, official
results indicated Thursday.
   But the loser said a low voter turnout reflects apathy toward the
government.
   ``We have given ZANU (PF) a big fright. The low poll shows ZANU
(PF) has no support. People are disenchanted,'' businessman Fibion
Mutikori, candidate of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, told reporters
after results were announced.
   Herbert Ushewokunze, election director for Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union (Patriotic Front), said his party's victory
``was a vote against disunity and destabilization.''
   Harare city councilor Ephraim Masawi, 39, polled 7,254 votes
against 3,125 for Mutikori in Dzivaresekwa, a sprawling constituency
stretching east from suburban Harare to peasant and commercial
farmlands.
   There were 500 spoiled ballots.
   Only 16 percent of the 64,000 registered voters took part in the
Tuesday and Wednesday poll, compared to 80 percent at the last
elections in 1985, election officials said.
   Mutikori, 34, described the results as an encouraging test for
the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, which fought its first election on an
anti-corruption ticket.
   The new party wants to keep this southern African nation a
multiparty democracy. Mugabe says he will make it a one-party state.
   ``We are only 67 days old. We have not been allowed to campaign
but we still captured 28 percent of the vote,'' Mutikori said.
   In the 1985 elections, Mugabe's party polled more than 90 percent
of votes in Dzivaresekwa.
   The Zimbabwe Unity Movement was formed on April 30 by renegade
politician Edgar Tekere, the former secretary-general of Mugabe's
party who was No. 3 in the governing party hierarchy.
   Tekere has accused the government of intimidating his party
officials and cites the arrests of several party workers for
suspected subversion as evidence of state interference in the
election.
   In May, Tekere said police invoked public order laws to ban a
political rally in Harare, the capital.
   On June 11, the new party canceled a second rally when it found
itself locked out of a stadium where the meeting was to take place.
   Tekere, 52, was fired last October from the party he helped found
after he denounced official corruption and criticized Mugabe's aim
to establish a one-party state.
   This week's by-election was to fill a seat in the 100-member
House of Assembly held by the late Maurice Nyagumbo, a senior
Cabinet minister who committed suicide after he was named in a
judicial inquiry investigating corruption.
   Four other ministers resigned their seats after it was found they
used their influence to buy cars from a state-assembly plant and
resold them at inflated prices.
   New cars are in short supply in Zimbabwe and can fetch up to four
times the price fixed by the state.
   Mugabe's party last year merged with the main opposition party,
Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (Patriotic Front),
giving the new combined ruling party all but one of the seats in the
National Assembly. The lone opponent is a member of the exiled Rev.
Ndabaningi Sithole's Zimbabwe African National Union.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Seeks Life Sentence for Man Accused of Killing Palme</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief prosecutor sought a life
sentence Thursday for Christer Pettersson in what he described as
the cold-blooded execution of Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   Summing up the state case in the monthlong trial, Anders Helin
alleged Pettersson followed Palme from a movie theater on Feb. 28,
1986, and shot him in the back from a distance of 4 inches to 8
inches.
   Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede who has served a jail term for
manslaughter and who is a known drug and alcohol abuser, denies
killing the Swedish leader.
   Palme was a four-term prime minister who dominated Swedish
politics for more than a decade and earned his country its
reputation as an international mediator and champion of world
disarmament.
   Helin recounted the testimony of Palme's widow, Lisbeth, and five
others who testified they saw Pettersson at the scene of the
assassination.
   Mrs. Palme, he said, had pointed out Pettersson at a videotaped
police lineup and again in the courtroom, after studying pictures of
647 other possible suspects during the three-year manhunt.
   He said the verdict could only be first-degree murder, ``when
considering that he waited for Olof Palme, that he, to quote the
witness (Inge) Morelius, `executed him in cold blood with a shot in
the back.'
   ``If the District Court decides it was murder, that means a life
prison sentence,'' Helin said.
   A life sentence in Sweden usually is remitted to a term of 14 to
20 years, and prison authorities routinely grant paroles, even for
serious crimes, after two-thirds of the sentence has been served.
   The verdict and sentence will be decided by two judges and six
lay jurors, each with an equal vote. Their decision is expected
later this month.
   Earlier, the court canceled its morning session when defense
attorney Arne Liljeros asked to check new evidence he said he got
overnight.
   Liljeros said the information is intended to give more
credibility to the only witness who supported Pettersson's alibi.
The defendant said he was at a suburban train station 17 miles from
the scene at the time of the killing. Liljeros said he would address
the issue in his summation Monday.
   Recreating the night of the killing, Helin said no one knew in
advance of Palme's last-minute plan to go to a movie with his wife.
The couple also decided on the spur of the moment to walk home.
   He said Pettersson, waiting to make a drug contact, saw the
Palmes enter the theater, left to get a gun, and returned to wait
for the Swedish leader to emerge.
   He followed the couple down Sveavagen street, passed them and
waited in ambush at a street corner, the prosecutor said.
   After the shooting, Mrs. Palme saw Pettersson twice, Helin said,
once when she looked up for help when her husband fell, fatally
wounded, and again a few minutes later when he was farther away.
   Although she did not see a gun, other witnesses testified that
only the Palmes and one other person were at the corner.
   The state contends Pettersson is hostile to any authority, and
cites this as a motive.

<HEAD>Bush Challenges Soviet Leader to Withdraw Troops From Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush spurned a call Thursday from
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for swift negotiations on short-range nuclear
missiles and challenged the Soviet leader anew to withdraw Red Army
troops from Poland.
   Conceding Gorbachev had described the idea of a troop pullout as
propaganda, Bush said: ``I didn't know he rejected it ... a lack of
enthusiasm, perhaps.''
   Bush said ``it would be nice to aspire'' to a situation where
Gorbachev ``wouldn't feel troops were necessary. I would have a
feeling that at some point the Polish people might feel that way.
   ``He's just taken troops out of Hungary,'' Bush said. ``Who would
have said two years ago that that would happen? We salute that. We
think that is good.''
   Bush used a nationally broadcast news conference to set the stage
for a trip beginning Sunday to Poland and Hungary. He also will
visit Paris for a seven-nation economic summit and make a one-day
stop in the Netherlands, the first visit there ever by an American
president.
   In his first comments on the sentence imposed Wednesday against
former White House aide Oliver North, Bush said: ``I'm glad he's not
going to jail.'' He refused to comment further.
   North was fined $150,000 and put on probation for two years for
his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Bush's news conference came on the same day that Gorbachev,
winding up a visit to France, offered to make additional and rapid
cuts in Soviet nuclear forces if NATO agreed to hold negotiations on
tactical, or short-range, nuclear weapons.
   Bush noted that NATO leaders, at a summit in Brussels, had agreed
to begin negotiations on tactical weapons only after an East-West
agreement had been reached to reduce conventional forces and
reductions were actually under way.
   ``The answer is to please read carefully what happened in
Brussels,'' he said. ``To look at the united NATO position and to go
forward ... with the agenda at hand. That will be the message. I
don't want to get off the track by reopening the short-range nuclear
forces package,'' he said.
   ``I see no reason to stand here and try to change a collective
decision taken by NATO,'' the president said, adding: ``We welcome
unilateral cuts on his side, certainly.''
   Bush declared himself untroubled by Gorbachev's visit to France
and an earlier tour of West Germany, saying it was ``good for world
peace that he takes those trips.'' He added, ``I expect he will be
delighted when I go to Poland and when I go to Hungary, for we will
be well received in those countries.''
   He also said he wasn't bothered by Gorbachev's popularity in
Western Europe.
   ``I don't really care about that, I'm not interested in that,''
Bush said, adding that a U.S.-government commission poll after the
NATO summit in May demonstrated that the United States' standing was
``pretty darn good.''
   Questions about his visit to Eastern Europe dominated the
half-hour question and answer session.
   The president said his stops in Poland and Hungary were not
intended to stir up trouble for Gorbachev or ``drive wedges''
between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``That's not what 1989 diplomacy is about,'' Bush said.
   ``We're not going to be there trying to raise tensions,'' Bush
pledged. ``We're going to be there trying to encourage the Polish
people to move toward reforms.''
   While saying he wasn't trying to ``make things more difficult''
for Gorbachev, Bush urged East Germany and other less open Warsaw
Pact nations to ``come along with the flow.''
   He said he looked forward to a Europe that ``is whole and free.''
   ``Our challenge is to help create the conditions under which the
Hungarians and Poles can recover economically and make the
transition ...,'' he said of his pending visits to two nations in
the throes of extraordinary political and economic change.
   He noted he could not impose his wishes on the internal affairs
of the governments of Poland and Hungary, but made clear that he
hopes his visit will assist a trend toward openness.
   Later, Bush told a White House symposium on Eastern Europe he
would press for an international effort to aid the Polish and
Hungarian economies when he is in Europe.
   ``They face enormous and political problems. They need our
support in their efforts. Simply showing our sympathy and
encouragement is not enough,'' Bush said.
   Both countries have undergone dramatic political reforms in
recent months, including the admission of Solidarity union leaders
into the Polish parliament under unusually open elections.
   ``We cannot solve all the problems the Poles and the Hungarians
face. But we've got to be actively engaged,'' Bush said. ``We've got
to hold out the promise of an alternative future for centeral and
eastern Europe _ a peaceful transition to a democratic future. And
we need to back up that promise with some practical assistance.''

   A backyard fisherman reeling in a bluegill
stepped into a lake to free the fish from a clump of weeds and was
nearly hauled in himself by a 7-foot alligator.
   ``I punched him on the top of the head, punched him real hard,
and he let go. In fact, my fist is swollen,'' said William Barger,
who suffered two gashes in his left thigh.
   ``I think when I stepped down in the water, he had just been
laying there and the first thing he saw was my leg,'' said the
6-foot-2, 230-pound Barger. The gator ``just popped up out of the
water and grabbed me by the leg. If he had grabbed my ankle or
wrist, he probably would have taken it right off.''
   After Tuesday's attack, three Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission officers and a trapper went to the mobile home park,
captured the gator and a 9-foot alligator nearby and killed them,
said Capt. J.R. Doxey, commission regional supervisor.
   Barger expects to be laid up for about a week.

<HEAD>Federal Inspectors, FBI Probe Nuclear Site For Waste Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators made a surprise
visit to a former nuclear fuel plant Thursday as part of a
nationwide probe of environmental and safety problems at nuclear
facilities, officials said.
   FBI agents and the federal Department of Energy's ``tiger team''
of environmental specialists descended on the upstate New York plant
looking for evidence of possible violations of federal laws
governing hazardous wastes, according to Dennis C. Vacco, the U.S.
attorney in Buffalo.
   They would probably be at the site for several weeks, officials
said.
   Vacco said the investigation was not specifically concerned with
nuclear wastes, which is the main type of waste handled at the West
Valley Demonstration Project.
   ``There is no current information of any problem in handling
nuclear wastes,'' he said. ``We're looking at pure hazardous
wastes.''
   ``Pure'' wastes are non-nuclear, chemical wastes.
   Vacco would not elaborate on possible problems or the nature of
the wastes, but people familiar with the plant said the
investigation may involve the storage of chemicals used when the
plant was still operating in the 1970s.
   West Valley, about 50 miles south of Buffalo, is a former nuclear
fuel reprocessing facility that is currently being decommissioned
and decontaminated. Thousands of gallons of liquid radioactive waste
stored in decaying underground tanks are being solidified into
cement drums and glass logs.
   Raymond Vaughn, of the West Valley Committee on Nuclear Waste, a
citizens group that opposes the storage of wastes at the site, said
he was not familiar with any chemical waste problems.
   ``It must be the old chemicals that were used in reprocessing,''
he said. ``The chemicals they use (now) are relatively innocuous.''
   He said toxic chemicals were used in reprocessing in the past,
and some may have been stored at the site.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said Thursday in Washington
that the West Valley investigation was the first of 17 such probes
by Energy Department specialists over the next year at federal
nuclear facilities.
   The Energy Department took over operation of the New York
state-owned plant 50 miles south of Buffalo in 1980. The government
is spending $800 million to clean up the facility.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins announced last month that he
had created ``tiger teams'' of specialists to assess environmental
compliance at all Energy Department nuclear facilities, including
the nuclear weapons plants.
   The West Valley investigation is the first assignment of that
special team, according to Christina Sankey, a department
spokeswoman.
   In addition to reviewing the handling of wastes, the team will
also assess administrative and managerial procedures, Ms. Sankey
said.
   ``It was a surprise to us,'' said Micki Andrus, a West Valley
spokeswoman. ``We knew of Admiral Watkins' plan but didn't know they
would be coming here first.''
   Ms. Andrus said several investigators met with project managers
Thursday afternoon and that more members of the investigating team
were to arrive Friday.
   She said operations at the facility were not affected by the
investigation, which is expected to take four to six weeks.

   Known in Roman times, asbestos was for many
years was one of the most welcomed of natural products. Its strength
and resistance to heat made it ideal for many construction and
insulation uses.
   It had a stength 10 times that of steel, yet could be woven like
cotton into a fabric that resisted flames and acids. It was tough
enough to brake a speeding locomotive and flexible enough to be
sprayed onto school building walls and ceilings for insulation.
   During the first 80 years of this century more than 30 million
tons of asbestos found various uses in this country. Most was
imported from Canada.
   But its widespread use began to decline in the 1970s after
pioneering research by Dr. Irving Selikoff of the Mt. Sinai School
of Medicine in new York made it clear that exposure to microscopic,
breathable asbestos particles can cause lung cancer and other severe
illnesses such as mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the chest and
abdominal membranes, and asbestosis, a chronic diseas of the lungs
that makes breathing progressively more difficult.
   The word asbestos actually is a generic term for a variety of
minerals with tightly woven structures that provide unusual strength
and flexibility.
   The most commonly used asbestos is chrysotile, a white magnesium
silicate mined mainly in Quebec, Canada. Other commercial forms of
asbestos are crocidolite, a blue tinged compound, and amosite, which
is brown. Both are mined in South Africa.
   Asbestos was used most extensively from the end of World War II
until the early 1970s.
   In 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency listed asbestos as a
harzardous air pollutant and in 1978 it restricted its uses, banning
spray-on asbestos insulation.
   In recent years asbestos use in the United States fell from
240,000 metric tons in 1984 to 85,000 metric tons in 1987.

   The State Department on Thursday discounted the
contention of American scientists that they had succeeded in an
experiment to detect the presence of a nuclear warhead aboard a
Soviet warship in the Black Sea.
   The department also said the only way to find effective
verification methods for the presence of nuclear warheads on
sea-launched missiles was through government-to-government efforts
and not by private organizations.
   The joint experiment was conducted Wednesday by the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, a state-sponsored body, and by the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a Washington environmental-advocacy
organization.
   The experiment sought to address claims by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the presence of nuclear weapons aboard
ships and submarines can be effectively verified.
   Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov said after the trial
that ``this method is regarded by the U.S.S.R. to be useful at
creating a comprehensive system for verification.''
   Karpov, speaking on the evening television news program Vremya,
agreed other means were necessary in any verification system and
said he hoped the experiment would lead to further cooperative work
on the subject by American and Soviet scientists.
   The United States has treated the Soviet claims very cautiously,
saying effective verification continues to be one of the most
difficult obstacles on the way of concluding the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, which would cut superpower atomic arsenals by 30
percent to 50 percent.
   Negotiations on a START agreement resumed last month in Geneva,
but the United States, citing problems of verification, has rejected
the Soviet demand that the pact include a curb on nuclear-tipped
cruise missiles aboard submarines.
   U.S. Navy officers say they will not allow Soviets aboard
American submarines to conduct the intrusive inspections needed to
determine whether a cruise missile is carrying a conventional or
nuclear warhead.
   In the Black Sea experiment, the scientists used a variety of
radiation-detection devices to measure the emission of neutrons and
gamma rays from a nuclear wearhead on an SS-N-12 subsonic cruise
missile aboard the Soviet missile cruiser Slava.
   The U.S. scientists, from Princeton and Stanford universities,
made their measurements with portable detectors placed alongside the
deck launcher, less than a yard from the warhead.
   Simultaneously, Soviet scientists from the academy's institutes
of geochemistry and earth physics used radiation-detection devices
carried in a military helicopter and a troop transport.
   But deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the
operation was not conducted ``under operational conditions. It does
not take into account the possibility that the effectiveness of
radiation-detection equipment could be undermined or circumvented by
shielding, concealment or other counter-measures.''
   Boucher said the experiment ``could create unwarranted
expectations'' on the part of the Soviet Union at the START talks.
He noted that the American physicists had also conceded their
experiment would not provide full-proof verification against
cheating.
   ``Despite our extensive efforts,'' the State Department spokesman
said, the United States ``has not yet found ways to effectively
verify limits on nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missiles. We
believe that issues such as SLCM (Sea-Launched Cruise Missiles)
verification can be dealt with effectively only in a
government-to-government context.''
   But Tom Cochran, one of the physicists, said ``all the systems
tested successfully'' during the measurments.
   Among the observers on the Soviet carrier were three Demcoratic
members of the House. They are Reps. John Spratt, a member of the
House Armed Services Committee from South Carolina; Bob Carr, from
Michigan, and James Olin, of Virginia.

   A chemical storage tank along the Houston Ship
Channel exploded Thursday, killing one worker and sparking a fire,
authorities said.
   Investigators were still trying to determine the cause of the
explosion in the upper level of a 50-foot metal storage tank. No
other injuries were reported, and no evacuation was necessary, Fire
Department spokesman Mike Warnke said.
   The Oxide Inc. tank, which contained a form of glycol monomer,
exploded while the victim was working on the tank, Warnke said.
   ``He was working near the top of the tank and was blown off by
the explosion,'' Warnke said. ``It's possible that the explosion
could have been related to his work, but we don't know yet. There
was also a thunderstorm moving through the area at the time.''
   Warnke said the tank was partially filled with liquid chemicals
and the remainder was filled with vapor, but the level was not known.
   The name and age of the victim were not immediately available.

<HEAD>Navy Delays Trident 2 Missile Test</HEAD>

   The Navy has put off until early August the
second submarine launch test of its newest and most powerful nuclear
weapon, the Trident 2 missile, Pentagon officials said Thursday.
   The first such test ended in failure on March 21, when the
missile self-destructed four seconds after it was launched by the
submarine USS Tennessee off the coast of Cape Canaveral.
   Although a second test had been anticipated for mid-July,
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams announced that the Navy's analysis
of tests involving the missile's rebuilt nozzle control system would
not be completed in time to meet such a schedule.
   Therefore, the test has been rescheduled for early August,
Williams said.
   The delay will not affect the Navy's plans to meet its deadline
for putting the submarine missile in full operation by March 1990,
the spokesman said.
   In the first attempt to launch the missile from the submerged
Tennessee, the weapon popped to the surface as planned and the first
stage ignited properly, but the missile then began spinning like a
burning pinwheel and exploded.
   Afterwards, Pentagon officials said they suspected a mechanical
fault in the part of the missile that swivels the rocket nozzles
from side to side, thereby directing the missile's angle of flight.
   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon
that is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident
1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to
individual targets up to 4,600 miles away.
   The Trident 1 experienced some test failures but was deployed on
schedule, Pentagon officials said after the Trident 2's first test
failure.
   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its
undersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and can
match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it is
launched from a submerged, moving submarine.
   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry
24 of the missiles.
   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Janet Mescus said in May that analysis of
data and parts recovered from the failed test indicated the missile
went out of control for two reasons.
   One problem originated in the mechanical link that transmits
direction commands to the first stage exhaust nozzle, which pivots
to control the missile's direction. The second involved the timing
and degree of the nozzle position commands as pressure was building
in the motor early in the missile's flight.
   ``Instead of commands directing the missile to go up and out, it
went up and over,'' Mescus said.
   The missile, also known as the D-5, is built by the Lockheed
Missiles &amp; Space Co. and costs $26.5 million each.

<HEAD>Domestic Partnership Law May Be Headed for Ballot</HEAD>

   On the day it was scheduled to take effect,
the city's new domestic partnership law was suspended because a
petition to take the issue to voters appeared to be valid, city
officials said Thursday.
   Two conservative clergymen submitted a petition with 27,122
signatures to the Registrar of Voters on Wednesday in an effort to
block the law and put it on the November ballot.
   They need 18,800 certified signatures to succeed and have a
``50-50 chance'' of qualifying for the Nov. 7 election, according to
Registrar of Voters Germaine Wong.
   The law, which recognizes gay and lesbian couples as well as
unmarried heterosexual unions, was unanimously approved by the Board
of Supervisors in May. Mayor Art Agnos signed it into law June 5,
making San Francisco the first major metropolitan city to adopt such
legislation.
   The new law permits live-in lovers to register with the city for
$35 in a procedure similar to filing a marriage license. The law
grants hospital visitation rights and bereavement leave to city
employees, and a provision to extend health care benefits to city
workers is being studied.
   No one actually signed up with the city as domestic partners
before the law was suspended, said assistant county clerk La Vergne
Keppard.
   Supporters expressed annoyance at the repeal effort but were
confident that the challenge will be defeated if it qualifies for
the ballot.
   ``We've got more than 60 percent of the voters' support for
domestic partners,'' said Jean Harris, an aide to Supervisor Harry
Britt, who authored the legislation.
   Although Wong said it will take her office several days to
validate the signatures, the city charter requires suspension of the
new law because the petition ``appears to contain the requisite
number of signatures,'' deputy city attorney Buck Delventhal said
after a meeting with city officials.
   If the referendum qualifies for the ballot, the Board of
Supervisors would have the option of repealing the domestic
partnership ordinance or sending it to the voters for approval.
   If the petition is ultimately rejected, the new law will
automatically take effect.
   Proponents heralded the law as a symbol of the validity of gay
relationships. Opponents, led by the Catholic church, said the
legislation weakened the sanctity of marriage.
   ``The up side of this whole (repeal) thing is that we will have
four months to educate the public and to really get the issues out
there and to help people really understand what domestic partnership
is about,'' said Larry Brinkin of the city's Human Rights
Commission, which was responsible for implementing the new law.
   Brinkin, who had planned to register with his lover as domestic
partners at a mass ``sign-in'' party in August, said he was
disappointed but not surprised by the repeal effort.
   ``It's not that I don't think people should have the right (to
vote), but I don't think it's necessary,'' he said. ``That's what I
hire supervisors to do. I want them to make the laws.''
   Leaders of the Catholic church did not sanction the repeal
effort, but Archdiocese spokesman Deacon Norman Phillips said,
``Obviously, we are in sympathy with its being taken off the books.''
   The petition was submitted by the Rev. Charles McIlhenny, a
pastor at the First Orthodox Presbyterian Church, and by Rabbi
Lionel Feldman, who is not affiliated with a synagogue, according to
the Board of Rabbis of Northern California.
   Reached at his church, McIlhenny refused to comment. Feldman also
declined to talk to reporters on Wednesday.

   With summer just a scoop or two away, U.S. ice
cream production in May jumped seasonally to 79.8 million gallons,
the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   That was up 16 percent from April and 3 percent from May of last

reported.
   And that was only ``hard'' ice cream. There were no estimates for
soft versions produced by machines across the country.
   But the report did show that ice milk production, at 37.4 million
gallons in May, was up 20 percent from April and 9 percent from a
year earlier. Sherbet production was 5.4 million gallons, up 26
percent and 20 percent, respectively.
   Frozen yogurt output was estimated at 6.74 million gallons in
May, virtually the same as in April. No year-earlier figures were
available.

<TEXT>
   Iran's new supreme leader, Ali Khamenei,
on Thursday urged Moslems to demonstrate and defy Saudi Arabia's ban
on political activity during the annual pilgrimage to the holy
cities of Mecca and Medina.
   This is the second year Iranians have stayed away from the
pilgrimage in protest of a Saudi limit on participants.
   But pilgrims from other nations should protest all
``conspiracies'' facing Islam, especially Salman Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses,'' said Khamenei, who was chosen on June 4 to
lead Iran after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   His 18-page message was carried by Iran's state radio and the
official Islamic Republic News Agency, both monitored in Nicosia.
   An estimated 1.8 million pilgrims from 80 countries are making
the annual pilgrimage, or hajj, to Mecca, the birthplace of the
prophet Mohammed. Pilgrims also travel to Medina to visit the tomb
of the 7th century founder of Islam.
   Last year, Saudi Arabia began limiting the number of pilgrims
based on a country's population. At that time, Iran was allowed
45,000 people, or one-third the number it planned to send.
   The pilgrimage season has been marred by disturbances since
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. In that year, religious
extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca and held it for two
weeks before Saudi forces stormed it.
   More than 250 people were killed, including 100 of the
extremists. Saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more.
   The Saudis arrested scores of Iranian Revolutionary guards posing
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and
explosives.
   The next year, 402 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were killed in
riots in Mecca that the Saudis say were instigated by
fundamentalists.
   Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef said Wednesday that if ``the
rulers of Iran are still bent on offending the hajjis, we reject and
will resist this. We will not allow anyone to undermine the safety
of the hajjis or the homeland.''
   Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran in April 1988. Tehran since has
been campaigning to strip King Fahd of his title as ``custodian of
the two holy shrines'' and place Mecca and Medina under
international supervision.
   Khamenei told Iranians: ``The hand of the enemy has again
deprived you of your certain right to make pilgrimage to the house
of God and the grave of the prophet.''
   He said the Saudi limit on pilgrims has ``added another dark page
to its black file. Our memory of history will not forget these
hostilities.''
   Khamenei urged pilgrims to ``gather in large numbers to express
their opposition and hatred toward the cultural conspiracies of the
arrogant against Islam.''
   He said Khomeini's death sentence against Rushdie ``still
stands'' and applies to ``any one else who insults Islam.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Feb. 13, when
Khomeini accused him of blaspheming Islam in ``The Satanic Verses''
and ordered his death.
   Khamenei also suggested pilgrims debate the Palestinian uprising
against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
the civil wars in Lebanon and Afghanistan.

   Net deposit withdrawals from savings and loan
institutions slowed by more than 50 percent in May to $2.4 billion,
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday.
   Two West Coast thrifts that lost a total of $1.4 billion in
deposits during the month accounted for more than half of the net
withdrawals, the S&amp;L industry's chief regulator said.
   After counting interest credited to depositors' accounts, total
deposits in the nation's 2,934 S&amp;Ls grew by $587 million during May
to $955.2 billion. It was the first increase since last December.
   James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, attributed the
slightly improved deposit balances in thrift institutions to a
normal seasonal resumption of savings after April withdrawals to pay
taxes.
   Barth also said the spread between interest rates offered by
money market mutual funds and S&amp;Ls also narrowed modestly in May.
   The May decrease in net deposits _ the 13th in a row _ was the
smallest since savers began pulling their money out of S&amp;Ls more
than a year ago as concern about the health of the industry
heightened.
   ``Passage of legislation permitting troubled thrifts to be
resolved should lessen depositor concerns and thereby enable the
industry to better manage its deposits,'' Barth said.
   Withdrawals from accounts of $100,000 or smaller, the amount
insured against losses by the federal government, declined from $5.7
billion in April to $300 million in May, the board said.
   However, holders of deposits exceeding $100,000 pulled a total of
$2.2 billion out of S&amp;Ls in May, compared with a $400,000 increase
in their deposits in April.

<HEAD>New York's Top Court Says Homosexual Lovers Can Be Considered Family</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 8-9, `Also this ...' to CORRECT that law was blocked

<TEXT>
   New York's highest court ruled Thursday that
a partner in a long-term homosexual relationship can take over the
couple's rent-controlled apartment when the lover who signed the
lease dies.
   In a 4-2 ruling, the Court of Appeals ordered a lower court to
reconsider its decision permitting the eviction of a New York City
man from a rent-controlled apartment he shared for a decade with his
lover, who died.
   In doing so, the court expanded the definition of a ``family'' as
it applies to New York's rent-control laws. The word is crucial
because state law says only ``family members'' may continue to live
in rent-controlled apartments, saving hundreds of dollars a month in
rent in many cases, when the tenant whose name is on the lease dies.
   The rent-control laws date from the housing crunch of World War
II. They limit the rent increases landlords can charge in apartments
with longterm tenants.
   The court said the definition of ``family members'' should
include adults who show long-term financial and emotional commitment
to each other, even if they don't fit the traditional meaning of a
family.
   The New York decision is the first time any top state court in
the nation has recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent of
a family, according to American Civil Liberties Union lawyer William
Rubenstein.
   ``Today's decision is a ground-breaking victory for lesbians and
gay men,'' Rubenstein said Thursday. ``It marks the most important
single step forward in American law toward legal recognition of
lesbian and gay relationships.''
   Also this week, a law was scheduled to take effect in San
Francisco permitting unmarried couples to register as ``domestic
partners,'' giving them certain rights such as the right to
bereavement leave from a city job if the partner dies.
   The law, passed last month, is strongly supported by gay-rights
groups, but some clergymen waged a petition campaign seeking to
repeal the measure and put it on the November ballot. On Thursday,
the day the law was scheduled to take effect, the law was suspended
pending certification of signatures to put the repeal measure on the
November ballot. Verification of the signatures, which were
submitted Wednesday, was expected to take several days.
   In the New York case, Judge Vito Titone wrote, ``We conclude that
the term family ... should not be rigidly restricted to those people
who have formalized their relationship by obtaining, for instance, a
marriage certificate.''
   The case involves Miguel Braschi, 33, who wants to live in the
desirable Manhattan apartment he shared for 11 years with Leslie
Blanchard. The two men were considered a lifetime couple and spouses
by their friends.
   Blanchard, the owner of a Manhattan beauty salon, died in
Braschi's arms in September 1986, leaving Braschi almost $5 million.
   Soon afterward, the landlord, Stahl Associates, attempted to
evict Braschi on grounds that he had no right to continue living in
the below-price apartment because he wasn't related to Blanchard by
``blood, marriage or adoption.''
   Braschi's lawyers said the rent on the apartment is about $700,
several hundred dollars per month less than it would cost on the
open market. But they argued that he and Blanchard were a family and
so he had rights under the rent-control law.
   A trial court said Braschi should be allowed to keep the
apartment at the rent-control price but the Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court, a first-level appeals court, reversed that and
said Braschi had to leave.
   In Thursday's ruling, the Court of Appeals said the Appellate
Division had failed to consider all the factors that should be
considered when determining whether a person is a family member.
   It ordered the appellate judges to consider Braschi's case again,
considering such factors as the fidelity and longevity of the
relationship, the level of emotional and financial commitment and
the way the participants presented themselves to society, Titone
said.
   David Picon, an attorney for Stahl Associates, said he would have
no comment on the decision.
   Rubenstein and other lawyers for activist groups said the ruling
would also apply to unmarried heterosexual partners and poor
families who can't afford legal fees to adopt children or obtain a
divorce.
   ``This court is stating ... that gay couples, lesbian couples as
well as other couples that don't fit the Ozzie and Harriet mold
should be recognized as the families they are in reality,'' said
Evan Wolfson, a lawyer at the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a national
gay rights group.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Richard Simons said the court was
too broadly interpreting the state Legislature's intent in drafing
New York's rent control law. The court majority's decision, he said,
``produces an unworkable test that is subject to abuse.''

   The government said troops supported by
aircraft and heavy artillery advanced toward a major Moslem
guerrilla base near the Pakistani border Thursday on the second day
of an offensive.
   The Soviet-sponsored government said the soldiers killed at least
287 guerrillas, wounded 238 and captured tanks, armored personnel
carriers and ammunition. It gave army casualties as only four dead.
   Each side in the 11-year-old war customarily exaggerates the
other's losses and minimizes its own.
   ``This is our biggest offensive ... since the Soviet troop
withdrawal'' completed Feb. 15, said presidential spokesman Sarwar
Yourish. ``Our aim is to push the rebels toward the Pakistani
border.''
   He said the army drove the insurgents back on the south and
southeast of Jalalabad, capital of Nangarhar province, which has
been under guerrilla siege since March 7.
   Jalalabad is 75 miles east of Kabul and 45 miles from Pakistan,
where most of the guerrillas are based.
   Afghan air force jets bombed rebel positions in and around
Jalalabad for a second day and guerrilla rocket attacks on the city
continued, Yourish said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said soldiers
advanced toward a guerrilla base at Torkham, six miles from the
Pakistani border, after overrunning insurgent positions around
Jalalabad.
   The Torkham base at the foot of the Khyber Pass, a major route
for supplies from Pakistan, is a staging area for attacks on
Jalalabad.
   In Pakistan, the guerrilla-run Afghan Information and
Documentation Center acknowledged the loss of some positions near
Jalalabad.
   An Afghan pilot landed his Soviet-made ground attack fighter in
Peshawar, Pakistan, and sought asylum Thursday, Pakistani officials
said.
   A Pakistan air force official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the pilot of the Sukhoi-22 jet ``refused to bombard
mujahedeen positions and fled to Pakistan.'' Afghan guerrillas call
themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   On Monday, two Afghan helicopters landed in Pakistan and their
crews sought political asylum.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1968 and Soviet forces intervened in December 1979. An estimated
115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistan when the U.N.-mediated
withdrawal began on May 15, 1988.

   Fun with fossils? University of Florida
researchers have created a program for amateur archaeologists that
residents really dig.
   A horse trainer, a postal clerk, a cab driver, a sewage plant
operator and a retired chemical engineer are among those helping
researchers excavate fossils on a farm about 30 miles west of here.
   The program, ``Bones: From Bats to Bear-Dogs,'' may not take them
far from home but it sends them 20 million years back in time. So
far, they have found three-toed horses, rhinoceroses and other
creatures from the Miocene era.
   ``It's thrilling to know that you're digging in soil that is
millions of years old and you're finding part of an animal that
lived at that time,'' Gloria Driggers, a second-grade teacher in
Orange Springs, said Thursday.
   ``Indiana Jones is just a movie,'' said Lourdes Chu, a
Gainesville cab driver who found the tooth of a three-toed horse and
a piece of camel bone after scraping dirt with a dental pick for
several hours. ``Actually, it doesn't turn out to be quite that
exciting.''
   The 12 adults are students in the class offered for the first
time by the Florida Museum of Natural History on the university
campus. It is taught by paleontologist Ann Pratt.
   The Bear-dog _ a giant wolf-like creature with a head resembling
a bear _ was one of the most spectacular prehistoric animals to be
found at the site, Ms. Pratt said.

   They could be discussing solid rockets or
bragging about their brains but this group of hyper-intelligent will
be square dancing instead.
   They are 100 members of Intertel, an international organization
meeting in Indiana for three days beginning Thursday. The
2,000-member group accepts only people whose intelligence quotients
test in the top 1 percent.
   John Hartman, an Indianapolis real estate agent and chairman of
Intertel's 1989 general assembly, said their bounty of brains
shouldn't intimidate non-members.
   ``We won't sit around making equations or inventing computer
programs. It's really, as much as anything, a good social
get-together,'' Hartman said of the meeting at the Holiday Inn in
which square dancing is high on the agenda.
   ``We have some bright people, but that doesn't mean we always
have the best common sense. We're about three degrees off plumb,''
said Hartman.
   Intertel members range in age 11 to 80 and must score 99 percent
in structured intelligence tests. That compares with 98 percent for
Mensa, another international organization of people with high
intelligence.
   Although one purpose of Intertel is to allow members to meet with
their peers, it also is involved in programs for gifted and talented
children.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prison authorities Thursday hanged a
Pakistani convicted of smuggling 5{ pounds of heroin into Egypt,
implementing for the first time a longstanding threat to execute
drug dealers.
   The Interior Ministry made certain the message got out.
Journalists for Egyptian and foreign media were invited to talk with
Anwar Hussein Kasser Hussein, 27, before his walk to the gallows,
very unusual in a country where executions generally are done in
private.
   The government is cracking down hard on narcotics smuggling, a
practice that experts say has increased greatly in recent years.
Twenty-five convicted smugglers _ including five women _ remain on
death row. Nine have exhausted their appeals.
   A group of prison and prosecution officials, a forensic doctor
and a Moslem clergyman witnessed the 8:15 a.m. execution.
   ``I am not a drug dealer. I'm a student,'' Hussein protested at
the end.
   ``I was trapped,'' he told reporters. ``Somebody gave it (the
heroin) to me. When I came into the country I found out about the
drugs.''
   Visibly shaken and wearing the red uniform of prisoners on death
row, Hussein spoke in a small room at Cairo's central jail, which is
equipped with an execution chamber.
   A slight, bearded man from Peshawar, Hussein said he had five
brothers and four sisters. Nobody from his family was present, and
Hussein said only one brother knew about the death sentence.
   ``There is no justice in Egyptian law. If you have money, you can
do anything in this country,'' he said bitterly. ``I could not
afford a good lawyer.''
   A prison guard embraced Hussein before he entered the gallows
room, and the Moslem clergyman asked him to repeat tenets of Islam.
   ``This execution is meant to show that Egypt is not a market for
drugs,'' said the Ministry of Information's Mohammed Agami, who
accompanied reporters to the prison.
   ``If we hand out lesser sentences, it will encourage the drug
mafia to deal in Egypt.''
   A Pakistani diplomat said prison authorities telephoned the
embassy on Tuesday to advise of the execution.
   ``I think the notice was too short, and the information was not
complete,'' said the diplomat, speaking anonymously under embassy
rules.
   ``In Pakistan a person to be hanged is allowed to see his family
hours beforehand, to give his last will. ... At this short notice,
it was almost impossible for Hussein's family to come.''
   Hussein's hanging came a month after Parliament enacted a new
drug law providing stiffer punishment for offenders and widening the
scope of the death penalty. President Hosni Mubarak has approved the
law, which awaits official publication before it is implemented.
   The new law calls for a mandatory death penalty for smugglers and
people who illegally grow or prepare narcotics, encourage youth to
use drugs or provide a place for the use of drugs. The government
first recommended mandatory death for smugglers four years ago.
   Under the current 1960 law, the death penalty is left to the
discretion of judges and was applicable only to smugglers and
traffickers. In most cases, judges convicting under the law opt for
long prison terms of up to life, which in Egypt is 25 years.
   There has been a sharp rise in the seizure of hard drugs in Egypt
since the early 1980s. Foreign experts value the narcotics trade in
Egypt at several billion dollars annually.
   Since 1985, the government has invoked an emergency law passed
after the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat to arrest drug
dealers on suspicion and hold them in custody without trial. The
emergency law gives the government wide powers of arrest, including
so-called preventive detention of people considered security risks.
   Hussein was caught on March 16, 1987, at Cairo International
Airport where, according to the indictment, he was trying to bring
in 5{ pounds of heroin valued at about $1 million.

   Lucille Ball was posthumously awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom on Thursday, as President Bush
described her and the four other recipients as American heroes.
   Also receiving the nation's highest civilian award in a ceremony
in the White House East Room were former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith,
aviator and war hero James H. Doolittle and statesmen Douglas Dillon
and George Kennan.
   ``You have left an indelible mark as you have enriched this
nation, and America is grateful,'' Bush told the recipients, adding
that they ``embody the achievement, vision and dedication that is
the greatness of this country.''
   Gary Morton, Miss Ball's husband, accepted the medal for the
carrot-topped comedian who died April 26 at age 77.
   ``Lucille Ball was a national treasure who brought laughter to us
all,'' Bush said. ``She was like everyone's next-door neighbor, only
funnier.''
   Miss Ball was known to generations of television viewers as the
wacky housewife on ``I Love Lucy.''
   Doolittle, 92, was a war hero, aviation pioneer and retired
military general who has received the Silver Star and Congressional
Medal of Honor.
   Bush said Doolittle ``electrified the world'' when he led the
first U.S. air strike on Japan after the Japanese devastated Pearl
Harbor. The U.S. raid on April 18, 1942, dubbed ``30 seconds over
Tokyo,'' inflicted negligible damage but shocked a nation that had
been told by its emperor that it could never be attacked.
   The raid was welcome news in the United States, and ``Little
Jimmy'' Doolittle became an instant hero.
   Doolittle, a retired general, was ``the master of the calculated
risk'' and a ``trailblazer in modern aviation,'' Bush said.
   Smith, 91, a Maine Republican, served in Congress for 32 years,
both in the House and the Senate. She served under six presidents,
beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.
   Bush praised her ``historic and courageous speech'' denouncing
the tactics of 1950s anti-communism crusader Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
   The president described the 85-year-old Kennan as ``truly a
visionary'' on U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Kennan, a diplomat for 27 years, ``shaped the way Americans have
thought about foreign policy in the post-war era,'' Bush said.
   In addition to writing extensively on the Soviet Union and
foreign affairs, Kennan served in several posts in the State
Department during the 1940s and 1950s. He was ambassador to the
Soviet Union from 1952-53 and ambassador to Yugoslavia in the early
1960s.
   Dillon's career included stints as ambassador to France under
President Eisenhower, undersecretary of state in the 1950s and
Treasury secretary from 1961-65.
   Bush praised Dillon for his contributions to Latin America and
Western Europe policy in developing President Kennedy's tax policy,
described at the time as revolutionary.
   Dillon, 79, later was chairman o the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
and Bush called him ``truly a Renaissance man.''

   President Bush's four-nation trip to Europe
will take him 9,040 miles over 10 days, with 24.5 hours of flight
time on Air Force One on the way to Poland, Hungary, France and the
Netherlands and back home.
   Bush will leave Washington about 7 a.m. EDT Sunday for Poland.
Because of the six-hour time difference, it will be about 10 p.m.
local time when he arrives in Warsaw.
   During a two-night stay in Warsaw, Bush will meet with Polish
leaders, deliver a speech before the Parliament on Monday and attend
a state dinner.
   On Tuesday, Bush will fly to Gdansk to meet with Lech Walesa and
other Solidarity leaders. He will deliver a speech at the Solidarity
monument near the Lenin shipyard where Walesa worked as an
electrician.
   Later Tuesday, Bush will go on to Budapest, becoming the first
American president to visit Hungary. A state dinner is planned on
the first night of his stay.
   On Wednesday, Bush will meet with students opposed to the
Communist government and deliver a speech at Karl Marx University.
   The president will fly to Paris on Thursday and take part in
ceremonies marking the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   On Friday, July 14, Bush will join the leaders of France,
Britain, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada at the annual summit
of industrialized nations. The summit will conclude on Sunday, July
16, followed by a black-tie dinner.
   On Monday, Bush will go to the Hague, where he will meet with
leaders and make another speech. Bush will return to Washington on
Tuesday, expected to arrive early in the afternoon.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Glad North Won't Serve Jail Term</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday he's glad that
one-time White House aide Oliver North won't serve jail time for his
Iran-Contra convictions.
   But the president, in response to a reporter's question, would
not address the issue of a presidential pardon.
   Asked what he thought about the judge sparing North a prison
sentence and whether he has considered a pardon, Bush replied:
   ``One, I'm happy he's not going to jail. Two, I'm not going to
comment further because this matter is under appeal and is in the
federal courts.''
   North is expected to appeal his conviction but has not yet done
so.
   Bush made his comment during a question-and-answer session with
reporters from foreign news agencies and a small group of American
press.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced North on
Wednesday to a three-year suspended sentence, two years' probation,
$150,000 in fines and 1,200 hours of community service work.
   Bush has declined to talk about the possibility of a pardon for
North, although 58 members of the House signed a letter asking him
to do so. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater's standard
answer on a possible pardon is that it has not been discussed.
   North's defense in the case was that he was carrying out his
activities to help the Nicaraguan Contras at the behest of his
superiors in the Reagan administration, at the time when Bush was
vice president. Bush has maintained he did not know the extent of
North's activities to help the rebels.

<HEAD>Army Allows Apache Helicopters To Fly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Army announced Thursday that its fleet of
AH-64 attack helicopters could begin flying again after an
investigation showed a fatal accident last week was caused by a
piece of improperly stored sheet metal striking the tail rotor.
   The Army has 486 Apaches, its newest and most sophisticated
helicopter gunship.
   The fleet was grounded Monday for the investigation into the June
29 crash in northern Florida of a National Guard Apache. The
co-pilot was killed and the pilot seriously injured when the tail
rotor came off the helicopter.
   In a statement at the Pentagon, the Army said the investigation
into the Florida crash revealed that the tail rotor damage was
caused by ``a foreign object striking a rotor blade.''
   Physical and chemical evidence found that a piece of sheet metal
used to help secure a door had been improperly stored and that the
piece of metal ``became dislodged and flew into the AH-64's tail
rotor system,'' the statement said.
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. John Chapla said the rectangular piece of
metal is about six to eight inches long and is supposed to be
securely stored during flight.
   ``It blew free and struck the rotor,'' Chapla said.
   The investigation was conducted at the Army Safety Center in Fort
Rucker, Ala.
   The Apache fleet was last grounded in August 1987 when
investigators studied the failure of one component of the tail
rotor. It was also grounded twice in 1986 for relatively minor
problems.
   The choppers, built by McDonnel Douglas Corp., cost roughly $13
million each.
   The Army's fleet was dealt a blow last month after dozens were
put out of service because of damage they suffered during a freak
wind storm at Fort Hood, Texas.
   The gunship is designed to replace the Cobra helicopter as the
Army's primary attack helicopter. The twin-engined machine, which is
designed to destroy enemy tanks, carries Hellfire and Hydra 7
missiles and a 30mm cannon.

<HEAD>New Premier Says Government Won't Negotiate U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new conservative-communist government
will not negotiate an agreement on U.S. military bases but will
leave it up to the government formed after elections in October, the
premier said Thursday.
   Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis told Parliament that meantime,
relations with the United States will be kept at ``the level
indicated by the traditional friendship of the two countries.''
   The previous agreement on the four U.S. bases expired in
December. Greece gave the United States 17 months to negotiate a new
one or close the bases.
   Tzannetakis did not say if his government would decide whether to
extradite a Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, who is wanted by the
United States for his alleged involvement in a bomb attack on a Pan
Am jetliner in 1982.
   The conservative premier, outlining his program to Parliament,
said his top goal was a promised cleanup of Greece's scandal-ridden
politics.
   Parliament is expected to give Tzannetakis a vote of confidence
on Saturday.
   ``The people are relieved to see that the time of cleansing has
come,'' Tzannetakis said in promising to investigate all scandals,
especially if there were indications that former Socialist officials
were involved.
   The Panhellenic Socialist Movement, with 125 seats in the
300-seat unicameral Parliament, failed to win a third term in office
in the June 18 general elections. Charges that officials of former
Premier Andreas Papandreou's government were involved in banking,
financial and arms scandals contributed to their defeat.
   The conservative New Democracy party, with 145 seats, and the
communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress, with 28, forged an
unprecedented alliance when no party won an absolute majority in the
elections.
   Party leaders say the coalition will govern only for three months
with the purpose of investigating allegations of political
wrongdoing, and that new elections will be held in October.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet officer said Thursday radar operators
handling many military flights failed to notice the pilotless MiG-23
fighter zooming halfway across Europe before it crashed in Belgium.
   ``To control every plane when there are so many is not economical
or practical,'' said air force Lt. Col. Anatoly S. Balikin, speaking
at a news conference.
   The pilot of the MiG, Col. Nikolai Skurigin, ejected in Poland
after reporting that the aircraft was smoking and heading into the
Baltic Sea. But the plane sped on and killed an 18-year-old man when
it struck a house in Wevelgem, Belgium.
   Skurigin appeared before reporters Thursday and apologized
profusely to the victim's family.
   Soviet helicopters were still searching the Baltic Sea when they
were surprised by Western reports that the jet had crashed 560 miles
away in Belgium, said Gen. Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, deputy
commander-in-chief of the Soviet air force.
   The plane flew over Poland, East Germany, West Germany, the
Netherlands and Belgium before running out of fuel and crashing into
the house, near Belgium's border with France.
   The West European countries protested the incident to the Soviet
Union for failing to inform them about the wayward plane.
   The Soviet government has offered to pay compensation to the
victim's family in an apparently unprecedented gesture by the
Kremlin, but has not yet spelled out details of the payment.
   At least one East-bloc radar facility picked up an unidentified
plane crossing the border into the West, Balikin said, but
authorities believed the report erroneous because they counted their
planes and found none missing.
   ``This all took place under difficult conditions,'' Balikin said.
``Over the city of Kolobrzeg, there were training flights of East
German, Soviet and Polish planes.''
   There were also training flights over East Germany, he said.
   ``The flight paths were parallel or very close to the flight
paths of this flight or in the opposite direction,'' he added.
   A U.S. official who declined to be further identified said the
Soviet explanation ``calls into question their command and control
of their own aircraft. It's like saying they had an accident because
there was a lot of traffic.''
   Skurigin said he had written a personal letter of apology to the
victim's family, but ``nothing can compensate for the death.''
   ``I must tell you frankly, if I knew or could have foreseen such
tragic consequences of this pilotless flight, I would have stayed in
the plane to the end,'' said Skurigin, a stocky blond officer. His
hand was bandaged, and he said received only a minor finger injury
despite ejecting just 330 feet from the ground shortly after takeoff.
   Shaposhnikov made a similar statement when asked whether the
Soviet offer of compensation would cover the death as well as
material damages.
   The offer of damages and the news conference with six apologetic
senior Soviet officers departed from previous Soviet responses to
military incidents.
   Soviet officials refused to consider compensation when they shot
down a South Korean airliner in 1983 or when a sentry killed a U.S.
major in East Germany in 1985, said Richard Pipes, a Soviet expert
at Harvard University. Soviet authorities did apologize for the
death of the officer, Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., but not until
three years later.
   Responding to a reporter's questions, Shaposhnikov said Tuesday's
incident ``was not a test of combat readiness'' of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization air defenses.
   Two U.S. Air Force jets intercepted the MiG over West Germany but
did not shoot it down for fear it would fall on a populated area.
   Officials at NATO said nothing to Soviet authorities about the
jet until after it crashed, Shaposhnikov said, calling for a system
for NATO and Warsaw Pact forces to warn each other of such accidents.
   Last month, the U.S. and Soviet governments signed a pact on
avoiding dangerous military incidents, but it apparently was not
applied Tuesday.
   The pilot said he took off normally Tuesday on his second flight
of the day, then felt a sharp jerk at the left air intake and his
airspeed dropped abruptly.
   ``I radioed the tower that 132's engine was out,'' he said, and
turned its nose toward the sea. ``My commander told me to eject and
I bailed out.''
   Skurigin said he did not aim the jet straight down because it
would have crashed into a town near the Kolobrzeg airfield.
   As he parachuted, he saw the jet heading down with black smoke
pouring from the engine. ``I did not see any flames or any
indication it had crashed,'' he said.
   The MiG flew onward using an automatic lock-on navigation system
that kept it on the same course against the horizon, said air force
Maj. Gen. Abrek Ayupov. Western sources said it reached an altitude
of more than 36,000 feet over Western Europe.
   The wreckage was taken to a Brussels military depot Thursday to
await Soviet investigators. Belgium has said the Soviets can take
the wreckage home. NATO officials have said the MiG-23, first shown
in public 22 years ago, is well-known in Western intelligence
circles.
   On Wednesday, a Soviet fighter jet crashed in Poland after a
collision with a Polish civilian glider, whose pilot was killed.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said it appeared neither
pilot was flying at his assigned altitude in the accident near
Lublin.

<HEAD>Labor Weighs Quitting Israeli Government; PLO Says Door Closed to
Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
Thursday the Labor Party will consider quitting the government, and
the PLO said Premier Yitzhak Shamir closed the door on peace by
hardening Israel's peace plan.
   U.S. Ambassador William Brown met the prime minister, head of the
right-wing Likud bloc, on Thursday, and a Shamir spokesman said
later that Washington sees Israel's peace initiative as ``firm and
abiding.''
   But the State Department in Washington criticized the tough new
terms.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher declared, ``Partisan declarations,
particularly if they appear to be more restrictive or impose
conditions, do not advance the process.'' Boucher added, however,
that the Israeli plan still provides ``the most realistic way to
advance the peace process.''
   Three parties on the left _ Shinui, the Citizens Rights Movement
and the Communists _ filed no-confidence motions against the
government in Parliament, claiming Likud's Wednesday decision mired
chances of starting peace talks.
   In a speech Wednesday, Shamir ruled out several peace options
considered to be attractive to the Palestinians.
   He said elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip could
be held only after the 19-month-old Palestinian uprising there was
crushed, Palestinian Arabs living in East Jerusalem would not be
allowed to vote, and Jewish settlements would continue to be built
in the territories.
   In Washington, the Arab League declared Israel's election plan
dead and urged the United States to abandon support for the
initiative.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which had criticized the
elections plan for failing to guarantee Palestinians a future
independent state, said Shamir's speech ``closed the door to peace.''
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman also said in Tunis, Tunisia,
that peace efforts by President Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III _ ``the only ones working for peace'' _ ``now face total
failure.''
   Abdul-Rahman said the uprising would be ``escalated because this
is the only answer to intransigence.''
   Israel's peace plan, introduced this year by Rabin and later
adopted by Shamir, calls for Palestinians in the occupied lands to
elect representatives to talks with Israel on an autonomy plan for
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Later negotiations would decide the
final status of the territories.
   Ministers of the center-left Labor Party convened a special
meeting, but it was postponed after officials learned that a
Palestinian forced an Israeli bus off the road and into a ravine
Thursday, killing 14 people.
   Shimon Peres, the party leader and finance minister in the
coalition Cabinet, said the disaster ``tears the heart apart ... The
entire nation is unified in sorrow.''
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal, who had urged Labor to leave the
government because of Likud's action, said such political moves were
``made pale by the events.''
   ``Today's disaster only stresses my belief that at these times we
need the unity government,'' he said on Israel TV.
   Peres spokesman Avi Gil said Labor's party bureau would meet
Monday to decide what course of action to take.
   In Jerusalem, Shamir reiterated at his meeting with Ambassador
Brown ``that Israel's political initiative continues to exist in its
framework such as accepted by the Israeli government and that there
were no changes made in it,'' spokesman Avi Pazner told The
Associated Press.
   Pazner said Brown ``expressed Washington's stand that as long as
the government is not introducing changes into the peace initiative,
Washington sees it as firm and abiding.''
   Shamir sought to soften Likud's decision by announcing plans to
``do the utmost'' to find Palestinian partners for Middle East peace
talks.
   He told the daily Maariv: ``I hope Labor will remain in the
government. They have no reason to change their position, but it is
all up to them.''
   Israeli newspaper editorials made light of Labor's threats to
bolt. Analysts reasoned that Labor was not assured victory if
elections were held.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Part of Lawsuit Over Rob Lowe Sex Tapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawsuit accusing Rob Lowe of enticing a
teen-ager into an erotic home video was cut in half when a judge
ruled the girl's mother can't claim emotional distress, but can
contend the actor seduced her daughter.
   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell, ruling Wednesday on Lowe's
motion to dismiss the lawsuit, said Lena Arlene Wilson can sue under
Georgia's law forbidding the seduction of a daughter if she alleges
that Lowe and her daughter, Jan Parsons, had unlawful sexual
intercourse.
   ``We will have a witness to that,'' Ms. Wilson's attorney, J. Hue
Henry, said after the ruling was made public Thursday.
   Henry said he will file an amended lawsuit to that effect Friday,
and ``we'll get ready for trial.''
   The lawsuit stems from a videotape which Lowe purportedly made in
his hotel suite while visiting Atlanta last summer for the
Democratic National Convention. That videotape _ widely circulated
on Atlanta's party circuit and shown electronically censored on TV
news _ shows a man who looks like Lowe in a hotel room with the girl
and another woman.
   It shows him seeming to stage-manage a sexual encounter between
the two, but does not show him having sex with Ms. Parsons. Henry
says, however, that he has witnesses who will testify that Lowe did
have sex with the girl.
   Ms. Wilson sued under the daughter-seduction law, and also
accused Lowe of intentionally committing acts that caused emotional
distress to the family.
   ``This is a case of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct,''
Henry told the judge last week.
   In his ruling, Tidwell dismissed the emotional distress claim,
saying the suit ``does not allege sufficient facts'' under Georgia
law to press the claim that Lowe intentionally inflicted emotional
distress on Ms. Wilson.
   Tidwell, however, rejected Lowe's motion to dismiss the claim for
damages on the basis of seduction. The judge noted that under
Georgia law, such a claim requires proof that unlawful sexual
intercourse took place. He gave Ms. Wilson 10 days from Wednesday to
amend her lawsuit to that effect.
   Lowe attorney Richard North told reporters the ruling was ``very
favorable,'' in that it ``narrowed the allegations against Mr. Lowe
by 50 percent.''
   Ms. Wilson filed her lawsuit in May in State Court in Fulton
County, contending that Lowe enticed her daughter, then 16, into
having sex with another woman while he videotaped them. Attorneys
for Lowe succeeded last month in transferring the case to federal
court.
   Edgar Neely III, an Atlanta attorney representing Lowe, argued
last week that the lawsuit should be dismissed because in Georgia
only a custodial parent has the right to take legal action on
matters concerning a child. Miss Parsons' father, John Parsons, has
custody and has waived his right to act in the case, Neely said.
   However, Tidwell noted in his ruling that, according to Ms.
Wilson's lawsuit, her daughter was living with her at the time of
the alleged incident.
   Lowe, 25, is the star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and
``About Last Night.''
   A criminal investigation into possible charges against Lowe is
officially continuing, although no charges have been brought.

   Police said Thursday they arrested the president of
a machinery company in a case involving unauthorized exports to
communist East Germany of rare material that could be used in
nuclear reactor rods.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified
the man as Hirokuni Matsuda, president of Prometron Technics Corp.,
a Tokyo-based maker of air plasma steel cutters.
   He said Matsuda was charged with violating Japan's Customs and
Foreign Exchange Law and could be sentenced to up to five years in
prison if convicted.
   Matsuda exported more than 22 pounds of hafnium valued at $28,600
to East Germany in 1986-87 without government clearance, the
official said.
   Hafnium is on a list of items strictly regulated under rules of
the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control, or COCOM,
a Paris-based Western watchdog body that regulates trade in
strategic items with the communist bloc.
   Because of its ready emission of electrons, hafnium is reportedly
used mainly in control rods for military reactors aboard
nuclear-powered vessels.
   The official said that Matsuda shipped 6.6 pounds of hafnium by
air to East Germany in February 1987, and an employee of his company
carried 15.4 pounds of hafnium hidden in his personal luggage.

   President Bush will name Michael G. Sotirhos
ambassador to Greece and Eric Javits ambassdor to Venezuela, the
White House said Thursday.
   Sotirhos, ambassador to Jamaica, had been a member of the Small
Business Administration's national advisory council and the National

international interior design company.
   Javits, nephew of the late Sen. Jacob Javits, is a New York

   State Department sources also said that Chris Arcos, the deputy
assistant secretary for Latin American affairs, will be named
ambassador to Honduras.
   Arcos will succeed Everett Briggs, who will oversee Latin

   The conservative opposition charged Thursday
that the governing party was trying to steal the Baja California
legislature to neutralize a conservative victory in the governor's
race.
   The National Action Party accused the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI for its Spanish initials, of setting up
three ``laboratories'' where the ``alchemy'' of vote-changing was
taking place.
   National Action's Ernesto Ruffo won the July 2 gubernatorial
election, but the party's executive secretary, Francisco Gonzalez
Garza, said the PRI would run the government.
   ``Ruffo would be governor, but PRI would control the political
decisions,'' he said.
   Abel Vinicio Tovar, secretary-general of National Action _ known
as PAN _ said at the same news conference that the PRI's commitment
to democracy had been called into question.
   The PRI has been the government's party for 60 years, but in
recent years has increasingly maintained its hold by fraud.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has struck several dramatic
blows against fraud and corruption since taking office Dec. 1, has
promised clean elections.
   The PRI conceded that Ruffo defeated Margarita Ortega in Baja
California. He would become the first non-PRI governor of any
Mexican state in 60 years if he takes office as scheduled Nov. 1 for
a six-year term.
   The vote is counted by party representatives who were at the
polling places on election day, and the parties make claims based on
their own counts.
   The official count by the state electoral commission will not be
released until Sunday, and the PAN claims the PRI and the government
are using the time to cook the figures.
   In the state legislature, the PAN says it is winning nine of 15
seats as well as the mayoralties of Ensenada and Tijuana. The PRI is
claiming Tijuana and 12 legislative seats.
   ``How could they lose the gubernatorial vote badly in Tijuana,
then win all six (of Tijuana's) legislative seats and the
mayoralty?'' asked Francisco Gonzalez Garza, PAN executive
secretary, citing figures gathered by PAN.
   PRI officials have admitted there were irregularities on July 2,
but maintain they were not large enough to affect the results. They
attribute the legislative results to ticket splitting, although they
have released no vote totals of their own.
   A person who answered the telephone at a private house that PAN
alleges is one of the alleged ``laboratories'' in Tijuana said the
owner was not at home. PAN accuses PRI supporters of taking ballot
boxes from vote counting centers to the ``laboratories'' and
stuffing them with PRI ballots or taking out PAN ballots.
   ``It's not true. None of those things are happening,'' said PRI
spokesman Arturo Galvan in a telephone interview from Mexicali, the
state capital. He accused PAN supporters of harassing PRI officials
and picketing PRI offices.
   Meanwhile, in the state of Michoacan west of Mexico City, the PRI
insisted it was winning a majority of 18 state legislative seats and
said it would ``fight for every vote.''
   The leftist opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party has said
its count shows it ahead, and the party accused the PRI of fraud.
   In Baja California, PAN officials said the PRI was trying to
stuff some ballot boxes and invalidate the count from boxes won
heavily by the PAN.
   Gonzalez Garza, PAN's executive secretary, said PAN figures
showed their candidate winning by a vote of 78,158 to 52,658.
   ``For a Baja California government, Tijuana is a determining
economic factor,'' he said.
   Baja California has one of Mexico's strongest state economies,
based on tourism and on cross-border industry. Tijuana is its
largest city, just south of San Diego on the U.S.-Mexico border.

   Spanish composer Ernesto Halffter was buried
at Madrid Almudena Cemetery on Thursday after his death at age 84
from heart failure, his son Manuel said.
   Halffter died at his Madrid home on Wednesday, his son added.
   One of his most popular works was the ballet ``Sonatina y
Sinfonetta,'' which premiered in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1929.
   At age 19, Halffter began his music studies in Granada with
Spanish composer Manuel de Falla.
   De Falla died in 1946. Halffter completed de Falla's unfinished
symphony ``La Atlantidad,'' which won critical acclaim at its
premiere in Barcelona, Spain, in 1961.

   Soldiers surrounded the hideout of ousted
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi and captured him Thursday when he tried
to escape through a balcony, the army announced.
   An army bulletin broadcast on television said Mahdi, 53, had been
hiding in the home of Mohamed Hassan Khalifa Sherif, who was not
identified further.
   ``The house was surrounded, and while a team was searching it,
Sadek Mahdi jumped out of a small balcony overlooking the street but
was immediately arrested carrying a letter to the Revolutionary
Council,'' the bulletin said.
   It did not disclose the contents of the letter or say what floor
the balcony was on.
   Mahdi, elected in May 1986, went into hiding after a military
coup last Friday. Soon after the coup, the junta arrested at 45
senior politicians and members of the ousted regime.
   Rumors circulated that Mahdi was outside the capital, protected
by his followers, or secretly in detention. Junta leader Osman
Hassan Ahmed Bashir insisted, however, that he had not left Khartoum
and soon would be arrested.
   Hours before the arrest was announced, Col. Suleiman Mohamed, a
member of the junta, denied reports that Mahdi had sent word
requesting a guarantee of personal safety before turning himself in.
   Earlier Thursday, Col. Hassan Dahawy told The Associated Press
the former premier had been caught in Khartoum.
   ``We have arrested Mahdi,'' he said. ``We are geting the radio
and televison to interview him live in a short time to show the
people.''
   Three hours later, however, only the bulletin describing the
arrest was broadcast.
   On Thursday night, junta leader Bashir announced a decree
establishing committees to investigate ``financial and
administrative irregularities'' under the former regime.
   In an interview conducted before Mahdi's arrest, Egypt's
state-run newspaper Al-Akhbar quoted Bashir as indicating the ousted
premier would be treated as harshly as anyone else if convicted of
corruption.
   ``His corrupt practices have ruined all services of the
country,'' the junta leader was quoted as saying. ``All those
responsible for this destruction will be violently hit.''
   The interview was published in Friday's editions of the newspaper.
   Bashir also said ``specialized courts'' of three military
officers each would try people charged with violating laws
regulating market prices, customs and public order, with death as
the maximum penalty.
   Bashir, 43, has said his priority for reform is fighting
corruption as a first step to improving the economy and national
security.
   Mahdi's government was buffeted by street demonstrations against
high prices and severe shortages of basic goods.
   The new military leader accuses ousted officials of destroying
the economy and hesitating too long to organize peace talks to end a
ruinous war in the south that was costing the government $1 million
a day while it ran up a foreign debt of $13 billion.
   Rebels began fighting in 1983 for more autonomy and development
in the south, where a Sudan's minority of black Christians and
animists lives. The government and military are by the dominant Arab
Moslems.
   The war has induced famine that claimed hundreds of thousands of
live in the south of Sudan, Africa's largest country.
   On Monday, Bashir was quoted as inviting rebel leader John
Garang, a former army colonel, to Khartoum for talks to end the
rebellion. The new leadership earlier canceled peace talks arranged
by Mahdi's government for Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Last year, army threatened to move against Mahdi unless he
speeded efforts to end the war. The United States and other
countries threatened to withhold aid for the same reason.
   Mahdi finally suspended harsh Islamic laws, which met a rebel
demand negotiations, and talks started in May.
   Part of Mahdi's problem was that he is a great-grandson of the
Mahdi, whose fervent Moslem followers defeated a British colonial
force and brought brief independence to Sudan in the late 1800s. The
mantle of religious leadership caused him to avoid decisions that
may have been interpreted as anti-Moslem.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Marvin Mandel was reinstated as
a lawyer Thursday in a 90-second ceremony that he called ``the last
step in a long journey'' back from his 1977 conviction on political
corruption charges.
   Mandel, 69, took the oath from Alexander Cummings, clerk of the
Court of Appeals, as his wife and his lawyers looked on.
   ``We got it done,'' the former Democratic governor said as he
signed his name in a book containing signatures of other lawyers
admitted to the bar in Maryland.
   Asked by reporters after the ceremony to describe his feelings,
Mandel replied, ``It's really an overwhelming feeling. It's been a
long time coming. It's the culmination of many years of struggle.''
   Mandel was disbarred after he failed to overturn his conviction
on mail fraud and racketeering charges. He served nearly 19 months
of a four-year prison sentence before President Reagan ordered his
release in December 1981 from a federal prison camp at Eglin Air
Force Base in Florida.
   He became eligible to apply for reinstatment to the bar when the
U.S. Supreme Court overturned his conviction last month.
   New lawyers normally take the oath at a session of the Court of
Appeals, which is on summer recess and will not return until
September. Mandel got permission from Chief Judge Robert Murphy to
have Cummings administer the oath instead of the chief judge.
   Asked why he moved so quickly to regain the right to practice
law, Mandel replied, ``Because I've been waiting eight years.
September is two months away. Why wait?''
   He was unsure whether he will practice law on his own or join a
law firm.
   ``Those are the kinds of questions I'm going to take a little
time to answer,'' he said.
   Mandel, who was named governor in 1969 and was elected to two
terms, said he will remain active in politics but has ``no intention
at this point of running for political office because there are none
available right now.''
   Having his conviction overturned and regaining the right to
practice law were the two most important steps in returning to a
normal life, Mandel said.
   ``I think this is the culmination of all of it,'' he said. ``I
think it's the last step on a long journey.''

   A Palestinian shouting the glory of
Allah grabbed the steering wheel and forced an Israeli bus over a
cliff into a 200-foot ravine Thursday, police said. The bus exploded
in flames, killing 14 people.
   Twenty-seven people were reported injured. Police said the
Palestinian passenger survived and was captured.
   Israel radio said the Palestinian was 28 years old and was from
the occupied territories, where an uprising against Israeli rule
began 19 months ago. He reportedly told his interrogators he wanted
to avenge the beating of his relatives by Israeli soldiers.
   Helicopters brought the dead and injured up from the gutted bus,
which lay in a circle of burned grass below the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem
highway eight miles west of Jerusalem. They also hauled up shoes,
purses, wallets, eyeglasses, a Book of Psalms and other belongings
of the victims.
   ``I can't describe it. ... You see something black that just a
few minutes ago was a human being,'' said Rami Yaffe, head of the
fire brigade that helped in rescue operations.
   U.S. officials said seven of the injured were Americans,
including a woman visiting Israel to watch her daughter compete in
the Maccabiah Games for Jewish athletes, but did not identify them.
One of the injured was identified as Canadian and another as a
tourist from Spain.
   Officials said two people were unaccounted for.
   Police Commisssioner David Krauss said after the Palestinian's
arrest: ``We know for certain that this man is the attacker. Maybe
he was the one who also planned it. Inside the bus, he acted alone.''
   The man was seen by photographers lying on the ground with a
bandage on his head.
   Krauss said police detained a second suspect and were checking
whether he was related to the attacker. Army radio said he was the
young man's father, was also on the bus and was injured.
   Security officials told Israel radio and Israel's Itim news
agency the assailant was suspected of being a member of a Moslem
fundamentalist group who acted out of ``nationalistic-religious
motives.''
   The radio said he had worked at Tel Aviv's open-air Hacarmel
market.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on army radio the bus crash
was ``a shocking disaster, the fruit of a disgusting mind.''
   Bassam Abu Sharif, a top aide to PLO chief Yasser Arafat, called
the attack ``a human reaction by someone who has had his children
killed, seen families deported, houses demolished.'' He spoke by
telephone to Paris from Palestine Liberation Organization
headquarters in Tunis.
   It was the worst such incident since March 11, 1978, when
Palestinian guerrillas from the PLO's Fatah faction infiltrated
Israel from the sea and hijacked a bus near Tel Aviv. Thirty-three
people were killed and 82 wounded.
   Israelis called a popular radio talk show and demanded the death
penalty for terrorists.
   ``The death penalty would help at least to calm us. We would know
he got his and didn't get out free,'' said one woman caller, Ora
Hanama.
   Armed police officers and border police troops surrounded the
assailant's bed at Hadassah Hospital after members of the anti-Arab
Kach party threatened in telephone calls to kill the attacker.
   Israel radio said police in Jerusalem were reinforced to prevent
revenge attacks against Arabs. Itim said two Arabs were beaten at
the open-air Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem, and Israel TV
reported three Arabs were forced off a Jerusalem bus and beaten.
   The bus driver, interviewed from his hospital bed on army radio,
said a bearded Arab man approached as if to ask a question.
   ``He jumped on the steering wheel, shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' (God
is great!) and pulled it with all his strength to the right,'' said
the driver, Moshe Elul.
   Elul said he tried turn the wheel back but the Arab ``simply sat
down and put his legs on the front dashboard to give him support,
and that's how he dragged us down.''
   The phrase ``Allahu Akbar'' has become a battle cry of the
Palestinian uprising, in which nearly 550 Palestinians have died.
Before Thursday's crash, 23 Israelis died in uprising-related
violence.
   The crash occurred at 11:40 a.m. Witnesses said the red-and-white
bus of the Egged bus cooperative broke through a steel barrier on a
straight section of the four-lane highway. The bus, which carries
about 50 passengers, was full.
   Victor Assal, 23, an Israeli soldier who emigrated from Bethesda,
Md., last year, said he was asleep on the bus en route to visit his
mother in Jerusalem.
   ``I woke up when the bus started to turn really sharply to the
right,'' he said. ``I saw people screaming up front. All of a sudden
the ground turned 90 degrees. The first thing I did was grab for my
gun. Then I lost consciousness.''
   An army CH-53 helicopter landed on the highway to help evacuate
the injured, and smaller Huey choppers ferried victims from the
ravine.
   An army rescue team was brought in, and some motorists climbed
into the ravine on ropes to help. Orthodox students in black hats
and long coats rushed from a nearby Jewish seminary to give
assistance.

   Former PTL executive David Taggart bought
$100,000 worth of jewelry and spent $400,000 on other things the
same year he told the IRS his gross adjusted income was $107,000, a
tax attorney testified Thursday.
   ``Did the defendant ever tell you how he could purchase items
worth $500,000 when his income was $100,000?'' Justice Department
prosecutor David Brown asked former PTL tax attorney Robert Gunst.
   ``It looks like a mistake was made,'' said Gunst, who prepared
Taggart's 1984 tax return.
   David Taggart and his brother, James, were indicted in December
on charges of failing to pay $487,000 in income taxes. Prosecutors
say they diverted $1.1 million of ministry funds to their personal
use by taking cash advances on PTL credit cards and using blank
ministry checks to pay the credit card bills.
   Other purchases questioned Thursday included a one-bedroom
apartment on the 57th floor of New York's Trump Tower, which Gunst
said the two brothers bought in 1986 for $640,000.
   They had previously leased an apartment in the same building,
Gunst said, and James Taggart deducted his $2,000-a-month share of
the rent because he claimed he used the apartment for business and
while taking classes.
   Gunst said Taggart was entitled to the deduction if he was
staying at the apartment while furthering his education. But he said
he did not know if Taggart actually attended classes in New York.
   The tax attorney also said PTL founder Jim Bakker approved using
ministry funds to pay $52,000 in back taxes and penalties levied
against David Taggart after an audit of his 1981 and 1982 tax
returns.
   Gunst said he found ``25 to 30'' boxes of credit card receipts
during an IRS audit of the ministry, and was worried that spending
by the Taggart brothers could threaten PTL's tax-exempt status.
   ``I told him (David Taggart) it was extremely important for him
to keep good records of his travel expenses and credit card
purchases,'' Gunst said.
   He also said he never asked Taggart about using PTL money for
personal expenses.
   Both Taggarts joined the ministry in the late 1970s as pianists.
Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, became Bakker's top aide and
James, 35, was the ministry's interior designer. Both were fired
after Bakker resigned in 1987 in the midst of a sex-and-money
scandal.
   James Taggart's interior design business was paid hundreds of
thousands of dollars to decorate the hotels and other projects that
sprang up at Heritage USA, PTL's Christian retreat in Fort Mill, S.C.
   Patricia Harris, who became Bakker's executive secretary in 1984,
testified that David Taggart asked her for several cash advances
from PTL's numerous checking accounts.
   Prosecutor Joseph Bender asked her if Taggart, her immediate
supervisor, was required to give her receipts.
   ``No, he said it was used for the Bakkers,'' she said. ``He would
just tell me he was keeping his own receipts. He said he kept them
at home in shoe boxes.''
   ``Why didn't you demand that David Taggart turn over the
receipts?'' Bender asked.
   ``Because I considered him the same as Mr. Bakker or Mr.
Dortch,'' she said, referring to Richard Dortch, a former top Bakker
aide. ``They were my supervisors. I asked, I didn't demand.''
   The trial of the two brothers is expected to take up to a month.
If convicted, they each could face 25 years in prison and fines of
more than $1 million.

   Fifty percent of Americans surveyed in a new
poll say they oppose the Supreme Court decision making it easier for
the states to regulate abortion, the newspaper USA Today said
Thursday.
   Forty percent of the 662 adults polled by Gordon S. Black Corp.
said they support the court's ruling.
   The court ruled on Monday that Missouri could require certain
medical tests of fetal viability and keep public hospitals from
performing abortions. The justices said they would hear three cases
next year that raise the possibility of even further narrowing or
overturning of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized
abortion in the United States.
   The USA Today poll being published in Friday editions did not ask
respondents their positions on Roe Vs. Wade. The announcement of
results Thursday did not indicate why those opposing and supporting
Monday's decision took the positions they did, and spokeswoman
Sheila Gibbons said she did not know if that was tabulated in the
detailed results.
   The poll found that 38 percent reported they would be likely to
base a voting decision on a candidate's stand on abortion. This was
twice the percentage, 19 percent, that reported basing a past voting
decision on abortion.
   Asked what regulations they might support, 75 percent of the
respondents said parents of those under 18 should be notified if
their daughter seeks an abortion, 63 percent said husbands or
partners should be notified when adults seek abortions and 44
percent said abortions should not be performed in public health
facilities.
   The Associated Press-Media General poll of 1,108 people in April
reported that 53 percent favored Roe vs. Wade and 65 percent said a
woman should be able to get an abortion if her doctor agrees to it.
These responses cannot necessarily be compared with the USA Today
results because the questions were different.
   In a poll of 662 people, the margin of error is about four
percentage points.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Thursday halted
an elderly-housing program that has lost more than $119 million on
projects, many of which government analysts had warned were not
necessary or were too large.
   The announcement marked the third time in recent weeks that Kemp
has suspended or canceled Department of Housing and Urban
Development programs because of suspected mismanagement and abuse
during President Reagan's eight years in office.
   Kemp said mortgage defaults under the five-year-old elderly
housing program totaled $250 million so far, and he said it had too
often served well-to-do elderly instead of the low- to
moderate-income population it was created to serve. The $119 million
represents HUD's direct loss to date in payments to private lenders
who provided financing for the projects in return for government
backing of the loans.
   As an example of the program's poor targeting, Kemp cited a Palm
Harbor, Fla., development he said charged $2,100 a month rent for
two-bedroom apartments. The audit of Midwestern projects approved
under the program found many were less than half occupied.
   Overall, 30 percent of all the elderly housing projects in which
HUD insured the mortgages are in default, as are 12 percent of
similar projects in which HUD is a co-insurer of the financing and
liable for 80 percent of the cost of any default. HUD is the insurer
or co-insurer of 150 such projects, said an agency spokesman who
could not immediately give a breakdown between the number for which
HUD is the full insurer and co-insurer.
   Kemp has been trying to get a handle on the agency's troubles at
a time when Congress also is investigating allegations of fraud,
mismanagement and influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   Kemp made his announcement as congressional investigators said
they would summon former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce to testify
about allegations he personally ordered the agency to finance an
unrelated project involving a longtime friend.
   In earlier testimony, Pierce denied any direct role in such
decisions. But published reports have quoted a former HUD official
as saying Pierce directed her to approve the project.
   Kemp, in announcing he was halting new and pending applications
for the Retirement Service Center program, said he planned to revive
the program after its guidelines were rewritten to guarantee
improved project selection and guaranteed targeting to low-income
elderly.
   ``This is a program that should serve low-income people but
instead is serving upper- and middle-income persons, and doing it
very poorly at that,'' he said. ``I plan a complete redesign of the
Retirement Service Center program and will require that it be
targeted to low- and moderate-income elderly.''
   The program was designed to provide housing to people over age 70
who can live on their own and afford market rents. The centers do
not provide medical care but do offer such services as central
dining and recreation.
   Kemp's decision came six months after HUD auditors completed a
harsh report of the program's implementation in the Midwest, where
investigators found that 25 percent of the completed projects were
in default and said that HUD officials time and time again ignored
agency economists and sided with developers in deciding how many
units should be included in the developments.
   ``We believe the projects failed because the field offices did
not assure adequate markets existed for the projects or did not
assure the project sponsors had adequate prior experience,'' said
the internal audit, released by HUD under the Freedom of Information
Act.
   The auditors said that in one case the Cincinnati HUD office
approved a 254 unit development, as requested by the developer,
despite an agency economist's findings that the market would support
just 125 units. In May 1988, nearly three years after New England
Village opened, only 67 of the 254 units were occupied and the
mortgage was in default.
   The auditors also criticized the Minneapolis-St. Paul HUD office
for approving a 208-unit development overlooking a gravel pit that
an agency economist said should be rejected. Only 76 of the units
were rented as of May 1988 and the mortgage has been assigned to
HUD. The project was not identified by name in the audit and
regional HUD officials did not immediately return telephone calls.
   The report by Thomas J. Bannon, the region's inspector general
for audit, listed four projects in Cincinnati with mortgages
totaling $35.2 million and two others in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
area totaling $17.9 million that were ``in default or considered
financially troubled.''
   In less than six months on the job, Kemp also has suspended or
canceled two other programs: HUD's rental rehabilitation program and
a loan insurance program for land development that financed such
luxury projects as golf course condominiums.
   In many of those projects, HUD and congressional investigators
have determined that politically connected consultants helped win
HUD's backing.
   In addition to Pierce, among those to be recalled by the House
subcommittee investigating HUD are Thomas T. Demery, the agency's
former assistant secretary for housing, and Lance Wilson, Pierce's
former top aide.
   Also, Republican political consultant Paul Manafort will be asked
to testify again because of questions about the accuracy of his
prior testimony about the role of his firm in HUD-sponsored
rehabilitation projects, panel aides said.
   Two other former ranking HUD officials, Janet Hale and Shirley
McVay Wiseman, will be asked to testify for a first time, the aides
said.

<HEAD>Summer Rains Soak South and East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The South and the East were drenched again with thunderstorm
rains Thursday that swelled rivers in Louisiana, closed roads in
Delaware and washed out bridges in Georgia.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the central and
eastern Gulf Coast to the Tennessee Valley, the southern and central
Appalachians and the middle and southern Atlantic Coast. Heavy rain
fell in some areas.
   In the South, flooding was reported in Pelham in central Alabama.
Many roads and bridges remained closed in Cherokee and Cobb counties
near Atlanta due to earlier rains that brought an estimated 2 to 4
inches of rain by Thursday morning.
   In Louisiana, high water flooded a highway at Metairie near New
Orleans, and some rivers and streams were at or above their banks.
   The lower Calcasieu River in the southwestern part of the state
was nearly 8 feet above flood stage. Many homes and camps along the
river remained flooded, and many roads near it were impassable. The
Mermenteau River was 4 feet above flood stage near Mermenteau in the
south-central part of the state.
   In the East, standing water continued to block roads in northern
Delaware. Many streets were flooded and small streams overflowed
their banks in Cumberland County, N.J.
   Flash flood watches were in effect from western North Carolina to
western and central Virginia, much of Maryland and northern Delaware.
   Thunderstorms also fell over western South Dakota.
   But there was relief from the heat that had plagued the Pacific
Coast and the New England coast when temperatures dipped into the
60s and 70s. Much of the remainder of the nation had readings in the
80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Arcata and Crescent City, Calif., to 110 at Needles,
Calif.
   Friday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from eastern Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast,
the Appalachians, the Atlantic Coast and Florida, and also over the
upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s through upper Michigan
and along the northern Pacific Coast; above 90 degrees from western
parts of the lower Ohio Valley to the middle and lower Mississippi
Valley, the Plains, the Rockies and interior Oregon and California;
in the 90s from the middle and southern Atlantic Coast to the
Florida Peninsula; above 100 degrees through the interior valleys of
California and near the Big Bend of the Rio Grande River in Texas;
and in the 80s in the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Opposition Nominates Single Candidate Aylwin to Succeed Pinochet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A united opposition nominated moderate
politician Patricio Aylwin on Thursday as its candidate to succeed
right-wing military President Augusto Pinochet in elections set for
Dec. 14.
   Aylwin, a 70-year-old law professor, former senate president and
current president of the centrist Christian Democratic Party,
accepted the nomination by a 17-party coalition.
   He promised that if elected, he would lead a government ``for all
Chileans and with all Chileans.''
   ``I have faith in victory at the polls, to win the government and
a wide majority in congress,'' he said.
   Election winners will take office on March 11, 1990.
   Meanwhile, the conservative pro-government forces continued
difficult negotiations to choose their presidential candidate.
Sergio Jarpa, 66, who served as Pinochet's interior minister, is
considered the front-runner.
   Most constitutional experts agree that Pinochet legally cannot
succeed himself. He was obliged to call the open election after
losing an Oct. 5 referendum. Voters rejected a military proposal to
extend his term until 1997.
   The coalition promised on Thursday to restore complete democracy
in Chile. It announced agreement on a joint platform for a future
civilian government, including major social reforms to aid the poor
and respect for human rights.
   The Pinochet government, which has ruled since a 1973 coup, has
been widely accused of human rights abuses.
   Thursday's nomination was attended by presidents of all the
parties and nearly every senior opposition leader.
   Hundreds of people, most of them young, gathered outside
coalition headquarters in the center of the capital, waving Chilean
and party flags, to follow the brief ceremony through loudpeakers.
   ``Aylwin, friend, the people are with you!,'' they chanted.
   Police, posted half a block away, did not interfere.
   Aylwin and other leaders stressed the unity of the opposition.
   ``I am, of course, aware of my limitations, but I'm sure I will
be able to overcome them with the help of you all, of the parties in
the democratic coalition, the independents, with the help of all
Chileans,'' Aylwin said.
   He asked the parties to put differences aside, ``to build
together the kind of fatherland the great majority demands _
progressive, free, just.''
   The nomination was made by Enrique Silva, president of the
centrist Radical Party.
   ``We all support you,'' Silva told Aylwin. ``You are now the
leader of Chile's democratic opposition, the man who will lead us to
victory and will become the first democratic president after so many
years of an authoritarian regime.''

<HEAD>Evacation Period Draws to End, Some Miners Consider Returning </HEAD>

   Thousands of union coal miners whose
vacations are almost over must decide by Monday whether to continue
wildcat sympathy strikes or return to work for the first time in a
month, officials said Thursday.
   ``It will be a telling day for a lot of concerns,'' said Joe
Cerenzia, a spokesman for Consolidation Coal Co. in Pittsburgh.
   In other developments, U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., asked
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to help end the strike, and Virginia
state police arrested 16 people trying to slow traffic around coal
processing plants.
   If the 37,000 United Mine Workers members end their wildcat
strikes, coal companies believe they can guarantee adequate
stockpiles at the nation's utility and industrial plants.
   If not, the plants will cut deeper into the 30- to 45-day supply
they normally keep on hand. Thursday marked the 24th day of the
wildcat strikes.
   Many union locals planned meetings before the weekend to discuss
whether to return to work, officials said.
   As many as 46,000 coal miners in Appalachia and the Midwest have
been on wildcat strikes, supporting 1,900 striking Pittston Coal
Group employees who worked 14 months without a contract and defying
a federal court order to return to work.
   Byrd asked Mrs. Dole to urge both The Pittston Co.'s chairman and
UMW President Richard Trumka to begin serious discussions as quickly
as possible.
   Byrd, who has contacted Trumka and Pittston chief Paul Douglas
and asked them to take charge of negotiations, told Dole that work
stoppages are starting to hurt the economies of West Virginia and
other states.
   Since June 24, many miners have been on a two-week vacation. Most
received pay for the time since their time off was scheduled in
advance, Cerenzia said. The vacation period ends at midnight Sunday.
   ``We're assuming that people are going to show up for work
Monday,'' said Island Creek Coal Corp. spokesman Jerry McPhee. ``We
have a contract and we expect them to abide by it.''
   In Indiana, a letter by AMAX President Douglas Ashby, published
as an advertisement in newspapers in state mining areas, said miners
should get back on the job to cut personal losses and to avoid
aggravating their employers' business problems.
   ``AMAX Coal Industries is suffering, our customers are suffering,
and most importantly you, your families and your communities are
suffering,'' Ashby said in the letter released this week.
   ``Your jobs are available today, and I invite you back before the
situation escalates,'' he added.
   The wildcat strikers are under orders by U.S. District Judge
Dennis Knapp to refrain from encouraging strikes, but the union
workers have flouted the edict since it was issued last week. The
judge is imposing fines on the miners for each scheduled work day
they stay out.
   In Virginia, where a federal judge has fined the union $960,000
for impeding the flow of traffic around coal processing plants,
federal marshals and state police arrested 16 drivers in a
slow-moving convoy.
   Striking miners in Ohio planned to discuss returning to work when
the national vacation period ends at midnight Sunday. Some feared
their employers would hire replacement workers and bust the union,
which signed a no-strike contract with the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association in February 1988.
   ``Some of them think if this goes down the drain, miners might be
in bad shape,'' said Charlie Greer, president of a UMW local
representing Zanesville, Ohio-area miners.
   Sentiments seemed similar in Virginia, said Steve Anderson, a
spokesman for Westmoreland Coal.
   ``Some people seem to think there are going to be some votes
taken in the next couple of days,'' Anderson said. ``The sense that
you get is that there is a high level of interest in people going
back. It doesn't mean that they won't go back out later, but that's
just based on what our guys are picking up.''
   Union officials in Washington could not be reached Thursday.

   The 23-nation Council of Europe has
spent four decades promoting parliamentary democracy and human
rights.
   It was established May 5, 1949, as Western Europe's first
cooperative political organization, but now lives in the shadow of
the 12-member European Economic Community and the the European
Parliament, the EEC's advisory body.
   Acting through a Parliamentary Assembly and its executive
Committee of Ministers, the foreign ministers of member countries,
the Council has gained considerable prestige in the human rights
field.
   The Council's stated objectives are to work for greater European
unity, improve living conditions, develop human values and uphold
the principles of parliamentary democracy and human rights.
   Although it has no power over member governments, the Council
exerts influence as a consultative and advisory body on political
and moral issues.
   The Council, comprising the Western European democracies, has
been described as a ``laboratory of ideas.'' Its role has expanded
into a variety of areas, including terrorism and drugs, and it has
produced numerous accords and conventions among members.
   The European Convention on Human Rights is best known, and the
Council's most public arm is the European Court of Human Rights,
which accepts individual cases and makes decisions are binding on
states that have agreed to accept its rulings.
   Other conventions deal with subjects ranging from sports
hooliganism to terrorism.
   Last month, the Council granted the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary
and Yugoslavia ``special guest status,'' allowing them to address
the body but not participate in decisions. The gesture was aimed at
encouraging better relations by recognizing political reforms under
way in those countries.

   President Bush announced Thursday the
cancellation of the debt of sub-Saharan African countries to the
United States.
   ``Beginning Oct. 1 the U.S. government will forgive official
development loans in the sub-Saharan countries,'' the president told
a news conference.
   In 1987, the most recent year in which figures were immediately
available, the State Department put the total of U.S. loans to
sub-Saharan Africa at $4.3 billion, including $743 million in
development loans, $1.5 billion from the U.S. government's
Export-Import Bank and $1.2 billion in U.S. government loans to buy
surplus American farm products.
   Bush did not say which of these categories would be included.
   Africa south of the Sahara Desert is usually taken to mean all of
Africa except South Africa and the North African countries on the
Mediterranean _ Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.
   Bush said his action would be in accordance with a decision taken
last year at an economic summit in Toronto to offer different
options to creditor governments. Until now, the United States has
preferred only to stretch out repayment terms.
   Bush did not mention Latin American debt, which is much greater
than African debt but is owed in large part to commercial banks in
North America and Europe rather than to governments. Major examples
are Mexico, which owes more than $100 billion, and Argentina, $60
billion.
   Earlier in the day Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady spoke to
reporters at length about the banks' current negotiations with
Mexico.
   ``With respect to Mexico they will sell those loans at less than
100 cents on the dollar and this is the first time that has been
recognized,'' Brady said. ``The stumbling blocks now they're arguing
about (are) whether those loans, which were borrowed at 100, should
be 90, 80, 70, 60, somewhere in there.''
   Other governments, notably in West Germany, France, the
Netherlands and the Nordic countries, have converted many loans into
grants. When major U.S. aid programs began with the Marshall Plan
for western Europe after World War II, the bulk of the money was in
grants. Over the years, loans became the preferred form of U.S. aid.
   As Third World debt mounted and the burden of interest payments
on debtor countries increased, the pendulum has swung back to
grants. Recipients of the biggest chunks of U.S. aid _ Israel and
Egypt _ now get grants and not loans.
   In 1987, sub-Saharan Africa owed $137.8 billion in medium- and
long-term debt. It was estimated that payments due from these
countries had risen from $5.6 billion in 1979 to $21 billion a year
for the period 1986 to 1989.
   Total Third World debt is put at about $1.3 trillion.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday
ordered a ban on most remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos,
forbidding its use in hundreds of products from automobile brake
parts to water pipes.
   The prohibition will be phased in over the next seven years and
apply only to new products. Asbestos-containing products already in
use _ and not affected by previous restrictions _ are not included
because in some cases replacement might be more hazardous than a
gradual phase-out, officials said.
   The action, however, will end the use of asbestos by 1996 in all
but a handful of commercial products _ guided missile liners,
acetylene cylinders and some sealing tapes, for example _ for which
no adequate substitute has been found and where concerns about
health risks are minimal, the agency said.
   In the final phase of the ban, beginning in 1996, an estimated 94
percent of uses of asbestos will be prohibited, said the agency.
   ``We're eliminating a known cancer-causing substance from the
marketplace,'' declared EPA Administrator William Reilly at a news
conference. He said that despite the known cancer threat from
asbestos the mineral continues to be widely used.
   The EPA action does not affect continuing efforts to rid
buildings, including schools, of loosely formed asbestos insulation
and spray-on asbestos, both of which have been banned from
production since 1978. The EPA reiterated that removal of such
asbestos should be carefully controlled to prevent even more serious
exposure from airborne particles.
   Under the new regulation, the use of asbestos in some products,
including roofing material, pipe wrap and sheet products will be
banned next year; its use by automakers in brake pads and linings
will be prohibited beginning in 1993, and its use in auto
replacement parts, cement water distribution pipes, roof shingles
and a variety of other uses will be ended in 1996.
   Reilly said the timetable reflected the availability of
substitute products, some of which will be more expensive.
   The EPA estimated that the cost to consumers of the shift from
asbestos products to substitutes will be about $460 million over the
next 13 years. During the same time, the shift is expected to result
in a saving of at least 200 cancer deaths, the agency estimated.
   Asbestos over the years has had widespread industrial uses with
an estimated 30 million tons of the mineral used in this country
since the turn of the century, most of it since World War II. It has
seemed ideal for insulation and friction-product uses because of its
strength and resistance to heat.
   But microscopic asbestos fibers can remain in the body for
decades and have been blamed for a variety of illnesses including
lung cancer; mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the chest and
abdominal membranes; and asbestosis, a chronic disease of the lungs
that makes breathing progressively more difficult.
   Reilly said the EPA _ which first listed asbestos as a hazardous
air pollutant in 1972 and urged its ban in 1979 _ has taken too long
to remove asbestos products from the marketplace.
   ``The first question I had was why has this thing been around so
long,'' said Reilly, who was appointed this year.
   Critics have accused the Reagan administration of blocking
earlier EPA acton. In the mid-1980s, a congressional investigation
concluded that the Office of Management and Budget held up proposal
of a regulation for more than a year. That regulation was finally
proposed in 1986, but no final action was taken until Thursday.
   In recent years asbestos use has declined sharply because of
concern about its health effects. There were 85,000 metric tons of
asbestos used for a variety of products in 1987, compared to 240,000
metric tons three years earlier.
   Two of the most widespread and continuing uses of asbestos is in
the manufacturer of brake pads and linings for automobiles and
trucks. Although automakers have been phasing out the use of
asbestos, most new cars continue to have some asbestos brake
products.
   Asbestos also is part of the nation's water system. There are
more than 400,000 miles of concrete-asbestos pipe carrying drinking
water to thousands of communities. The EPA said that while there is
concern about health risks in the production and replacement of such
pipes, there is no risk of contamination of drinking water.
   Reilly urged against consumers attempting to dig up
asbestos-cement water pipes or to replace asbestos brake parts.
   ``Disturbing asbestos brakes, shingles, or siding already in
place where there is no health or safety reason to do so can cause a
much greater health hazard than leaving them in place,'' said Reilly.
   The expected regulatory action was praised by environmentalists,
   ``This is a new approach _ pollution prevention,'' said
Jacqueline Warren, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
   Ellen Silbergeld, a toxicologist with the Environmental Defense
Fund, called the action ``long past due'' and a ``landmark
development in protecting environmental quality and public health.''
   However, the Asbestos Information Association said that products
now being marketed with asbestos are manufactured, installed and
used safely.
   ``Current asbestos products bind the asbestos fibers in locked-in
or encapsulated matrices that significantly diminish fiber
release,'' the group said.

<HEAD>Striker Killed in Clash With Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police armed with machine guns fired
Thursday on striking construction workers, killing one and wounding
four, witnesses said.
   In Cuzco, a major tourist city, police said guerrillas shot to
death two university students and left notes on both victims that
said: ``This is how informers die.''
   Police opened fire on the strikers after an officer was injured
by a stick of dynamite thrown by someone in the crowd, witnesses
said.
   The clash came after 150 police troopers in riot gear confronted
strikers outside the headquarters of the Civil Construction Workers
Union.
   An Associated Press reporter saw five wounded strikers evacuated
from the building. One of the wounded died later at a hospital, a
union official said.
   The construction workers earlier had joined striking doctors from
public hospitals in hurling firebombs at cars and buses and breaking
windows in downtown Lima. Police arrested 40 construction workers,
according to their union.
   Most areas of this impoverished nation's economy have been hit by
strikes by workers demanding huge wage increases to offset
inflation, which is running at nearly 6,000 percent a year.
   Downtown Lima has been the chaotic scene of numerous marches in
the past week by striking teachers, electric company workers, slum
residents demanding the government provide them with electric
service and a mothers' group demanding government milk donations.
   The doctors' strike, which began more than a month ago, has left
nearly all public hospitals without doctors.
   The construction workers union, which claims 250,000 members, has
been on strike since Monday and has virtually shut down all
construction projects in the nation.
   In the demonstration in downtown Lima, witnesses said between
2,000 and 3,000 strikers took to the streets after a rally at a
hospital. The witnesses said the protesters also smashed windows in
offices, shops and the Crillon Hotel, a downtown landmark.
   Riot police used clubs and tear gas to break up the protests, the
witnesses said.
   The construction workers gathered later outside their
headquarters in La Victoria, an industrial and working-class
neighborhood of Lima.
   During the confrontation that ensued, a secretary at the office
who spoke on condition of anonymity said the office was filling with
tear gas as she spoke and that shots were being fired outside.
   Union director Arturo Vicente said member Manuel Hernando, 32,
died after he was shot twice in the chest. He denied reports that
union members threw dynamite at the police.
   ``Our only weapon is the strike,'' Vicente said at a news
conference. ``We don't respond with dynamite, but with reason.''
   Meanwhile, police in Cuzco said Shining Path rebels shot to death
Walter Huayllani, a 24-year-old law student, as he was driving home
on Wednesday night.
   Huayllani was a member of a radical leftist party associated with
a rival guerrilla group, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
   The movement is pro-Cuban and smaller than the Shining Path,
which considers Cuba, as well as the Soviet Union and China,
traitors to true Marxism.
   Police said Magnolia Zuniga, 30, a nursing student, was shot in
the head by guerrillas when she answered their knock at her door.
She was arrested two years ago as a suspected terrorist but later
released.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. underwent
quadruple-bypass heart surgery Thursday, and was in critical
condition in an intensive care unit, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Brown underwent open-heart surgery from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at
Humana Hospital-Audubon, according to a news release by hospital
spokeswoman Denise Damron.
   Tests conducted Wednesday determined there was blockage in blood
vessels feeding Brown's heart, and the operation bypassed four of
those vessels.
   Brown is expected to remain in intensive care for several days,
the statement said. It is routine for patients who have undergone
this kind of operation to be listed in critical condition.
   Brown was hospitalized in Florida last week after suffering chest
pains, and was transferred to Audubon on Tuesday.
   He was in good spirits Wednesday, and spent part of the day with
his wife, former ``CBS Morning News'' host Phyllis George Brown and
family members, the statement said.
   Brown underwent triple-bypass heart surgery in 1983 at the end of
his four-year term as governor and developed serious lung
complications.
   He withdrew from his race against Walter ``Dee'' Huddleston for
the U.S. Senate in 1984, saying it was because of doctors' orders.
   In 1987, he finished second in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary to Wallace Wilkinson.

<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama, the religious leader revered
by most Tibetans as a living Buddha, celebrated his 54th birthday
Thursday with a party in Malibu.
   The exiled Tibetan religious leader is on a 17-day visit to Los
Angeles to address followers of the 2,500-year-old faith and conduct
religious ceremonies. Though respected by all Buddhists, to some
followers he carries no religious authority.
   A group of Buddhist monks and others celebrated his birthday with
birthday cake, a tree planting ceremony, luncheon and traditional
Tibetan dancing in Malibu.
   ``We even sang `Happy Birthday' to the Dalai Lama, although they
don't do that in Tibet,'' said Betty Rogers, spokeswoman for the
religious leader's trip to Los Angeles.
   While the Tibetan people traditionally celebrate all birthdays on
the first of every new year, they mark the Dalai Lama's birthday on
July 6, Ms. Rogers said.
   Tenzin Gyatso, who is the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, spoke on
Wednesday to a group of religious leaders from various faiths,
discussing how Buddhists can adapt to life in the United States.
   ``Each new place, new environment, new culture, Buddhism has
adjusted to new environments,'' said the Dalai Lama. ``Eventually,
Western Buddhism, American Buddhism, and English Buddhism will
happen in the same sense.''
   The Dalai Lama advised his listeners to preserve their values,
but to ``be aware of the other culture's values, too.''
   The Dalai Lama is revered as the the 14th reincarnation of a
founder of the Mahayana wing of Buddhism and has spent the last 30
years in the Himalayas, where he was offered sanctuary after fleeing
his native Tibet because of military threats by the Chinese
government.

<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government has ordered
the expulsion of a U.S. citizen from the human rights group Freedom
House sent here to observe elections, officials and the man being
expelled said Thursday.
   Nicaragua has said it would accept such observers to confirm that
the process leading to general elections next Feb. 25 will be free
and fair.
   Nicaraguan-born Antonio Ibarra Rojas, 40, a sociology professor
at Dubuque University in Iowa, said he came here June 11 to report
for Freedom House on the arrival of Alfredo Cesar and a group of
followers.
   Cesar is the first active member of the Miami-based Nicaraguan
Resistance directorate to return home to join the political process.
The Resistance is an umbrella organization of U.S.-supported
guerrilla and exiled political groups opposed to the Sandinistas.
   Ibarra, a naturalized U.S. citizen who writes for Freedom at
Issue, the official Freedom House magazine, said he applied on
Wednesday for accreditation as an electoral observer with the
Supreme Electoral Council.
   Hours later, Ibarra said, immigration officials took him by force
from his home to immigration offices and accused him of overstaying
his 30-day permit.
   ``I showed them an approved extension for 75 more days,'' Ibarra
said. ``They they said I had changed addresses without notifying
them.
   ``These are just bad excuses,'' Ibarra said. ``If they are so
open and are going to have free elections, why don't they want
independent observers?
   ``At no time have we come to sabotage or boycott the electoral
process.''
   Ibarra said he was consulting his lawyer to appeal the expulsion
order.
   Interior Ministry spokeswoman Patricia Orozco said immigration
authorities visited addresses Ibarra gave them and failed to find
him.
   ``He also had stated `business' as his motive for visiting
Nicaragua. But he is doing journalistic work, and that's another
kind of business,'' she said.
   Freedom House was an observer in 1984 elections won by the
Sandinista National Liberation Front. The leftist Sandinistas came
to power in a popular revolution that ousted U.S.-backed dictator
Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.

   Utah firefighters sweltered in 100-degree heat Thursday as they
struggled to contain a 7,000-acre wildfire and forest officials in
Wyoming trying to douse a 2,400-acre blaze worried about weekend
weather forecasts of dry lightning.
   In California, flames that scorched 1,100 acres of thick brush
raged untamed in rugged terrain near the Mexican border, but
firefighters were gaining on the last in a series of wildfires in
the southern part of the state.
   Fires also charred land in Colorado, Georgia and Alaska.
   Utah firefighters, reinforced by fresh crews, labored in the
100-degree heat to hand dig miles of fire lines on steep, tinder-dry
terrain in an effort to stop blazes that have blackened 11,000 acres
of eastern forests.
   Most of the fires still raged out of control, but an army of 200
firefighters was slowly gaining the upper hand on the 7,000-acre
Diamond Peak blaze, the largest uncontrolled fire in the lower 48
states on Thursday, said Mary Plumb, spokeswoman for the Bureau of
Land Management's Moab district.
   The Diamond Peak fire, located about 20 miles west of the
Utah-Colorado border, was 40 percent contained Thursday.
   Officials expect to fully contain the fire by Saturday, Plumb
said.
   In Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyo., about 340 firefighters
and a helicopter battled a fire that started Tuesday and grew from
2,200 acres to 2,400 acres Thursday in warm, breezy weather.
   The fire about 40 miles southeast of Pinedale and 150 miles
southeast of Yellowstone National Park was 5 percent contained, said
forest spokesman Ed Christian. Officials do not expect to contain
the fire until July 13.
   The weekend weather forecast made the potential for further fire
danger ``very high,'' Christian said. He added that the National
Weather Service was predicting record high temperatures in
northwestern Wyoming for the rest of the week.
   The forest fires across the West were creating a shortage of
firefighters and equipment. Christian said forest officials have
ordered another 160 firefighters and seven helicopters to help fight
the Bridger-Teton fire, but he did not know when they would arrive.
   In California, nearly 5,000 acres have been blackened by an
unrelenting string of fires from Ventura County northwest of Los
Angeles to San Diego County, 160 miles to the southeast.
   Five air tankers and three helicopters bombarding the latest
blaze with water and fire retardants supported 800 firefighters on
the ground as the fire roared unabated through steep, rocky canyons
40 miles east of San Diego.
   A quarter of the fire area was surrounded and another 25 percent
was declared under control at midday, officials said.
   In Colorado, slightly cooler weather and some cloud cover over
the central mountains gave firefighters hope as they continued to
mop up fires in the Colorado mountains.
   In Georgia, a 500-acre fire that broke out when lightning struck
in the Okefenokee Swamp in Fargo was 15 percent contained and three
work crews tried to put out the rest, said Chris Zajicek, fire
information officer for the U.S. Forest Service.
   A prolonged stretch of warm, dry weather in the southern half of
mainland Alaska put the 1989 wildfire season in full swing, state
officials said.
   Thirty-three crews either were in the field or on their way to
fires in six areas, according to Bill Beebe, the state's fire
information officer.
   The worst fires were in the McGrath area. Lightning was suspected
as the cause of a fire that had spread to 9,000 acres near Swinging
Dome near the mostly abandoned mining community of Flat.
   Three fires in steep terrain near Crooked Creek grew from 840
acres to more than 2,000 acres Tuesday night. Beebe said 17 crews
were working the Crooked Creek blazes. Another fire of unknown size
is burning in the DeCourcy Mountain Mine area.

<HEAD>`China Beach,' `Wonder Years' Among Humanitas Prize Winners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's ``China Beach'' and ``The Wonder Years''
were among winners Thursday of 1989 Humanitas Prizes, given for
network programs displaying ``values that enrich the viewing
public.''
   The 15th annual cash prizes were also awarded to an edition of
the ``CBS Schoolbreak Special'' and an episode from ABC's ``The New
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.''
   NBC's documentary ``Destined to Live,'' about breast cancer, also
was singled out to receive a Humanitas prize.
   There were no awards for television movies this year because
Humanitas organizers felt no project deserved recognition.
   Patricia Green, the writer of ``China Beach's'' ``Promised Land''
episode, was given a $15,000 prize for her dramatization of the
absurdity of racial prejudice and her portrayal of the importance of
peace.
   In the 30-minute category, Matthew Carlson took a $10,000
Humanitas prize for writing the ``Pottery Will Get You Somewhere''
episode of ``The Wonder Years.'' Carlson's segment dealt with a
family's struggle with new roles, and a child's response to his
parents' failure to communicate.
   A $10,000 award was presented to writer Alan Gansberg in the
children's live action competition. Gansberg's script for ``My Past
is My Own'' on the ``CBS Schoolbreak Special'' explored the power of
seemingly powerless people and the theme that today's freedoms are
the result of earlier sacrifices.
   For children's animation, Doug Hutchinson and Larry Bernard will
split $10,000 for scripting the ``Find Her, Keep Her'' episode of
``The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.'' The episode examined the
need to both hold onto and let go of love.
   The prizes were sponsored by the Human Family Institute, a
non-profit organizition dedicated to the humanities.
   The Rev. Elwood Kieser, president of the institute, said future
awards ceremonies would recognize programs presented by public and
cable television and feature films.

   Major Western democracies
Thursday condemned China's crackdown on political dissent, and Japan
urged China's leadership to heed world opinion.
   The foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, the United States,
Japan, and New Zealand denounced the Chinese army's killing of
unarmed civilians in Beijing when the crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement began the night of June 3-4.
   Their speeches began three days of annual talks with their allies
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where fears and
suspicions of northern neighbor China remain deep in some quarters.
   A speech on behalf of the sixth dialogue partner, the European
Community, did not mention China, a topic that was added to the
meeting's agenda after the crackdown began.
   ``The recent formation of a new leadership seems to indicate that
China is in a process leading towards settlement of the domestic
situation one way or another,'' said Foreign Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka of Japan.
   ``Japan earnestly hopes that the new Chinese leadership will heed
the international opinion and will govern in a spirit of
reconciliation and restraint, well aware of its position in the
international community and particularly, of the important role it
plays in the Asia-Pacific region,'' he said.
   ``We deeply deplore the fact tht so many lives were lost by the
use of military force,'' Mitsuzuka said.
   The Chinese government has said that 200 to 300 people were
killed when thousands of soldiers marched on Beijing and drove
pro-democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square. Chinese witnesses
and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been
as high as 3,000.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III spoke of a ``new order''
in East Asia in which democracy and free enterprise are supplanting
communism.
   ``The going will not always be smooth, as events in China have
proven,'' he said. ``But to stand in the way of necessary, historic
change, as we have seen to our revulsion in China, is to turn one's
back on the future.''
   Foreign Minister Russell Marshall of New Zealand said the
brutality in Beijing was shocking in light of China's progress in
raising living standards and encouraging democratic values.
   ``We recognize fully that there are laws and practices in other
states that are the legitimate internal business of those states,
and none of our business,'' he said. ``But at the same time, there
must be a balance between the rights of sovereign states and the
internationally recognized human rights of ordinary citizens.''
   Japan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Seiichi Kondo, told reporters
that some delegates at Thursday's talks spoke strongly about human
rights in discussing recent events in China.
   He said Mitsuzaka told these delegates it was not appropriate to
isolate China and urged them to take a longer view.
   ``We should not push China into a corner as it would be
counter-productive,'' Kondo said.

   U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker III and Japanese Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka spoke of
the risk of prolonged civil war on Thursday in urging Cambodia's
warring factions to share power.
   Mitsuzuka proposed an international body for Cambodia's postwar
reconstruction.
   Their statements came in speeches at the start of annual talks
between members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
their Western ``dialogue partners.''
   ASEAN comprises the non-communist, rapidly developing nations of
Brunei, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Indonesia. The dialogue partners are the United States, Japan,
Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the 12-nation European Community.
   Both groups support a three-party guerrilla coalition fighting
Vietnamese troops who invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and the forces
of the Hanoi-installed government.
   Baker said Vietnam's plan to withdraw all troops by Sept. 30 has
``given new urgency'' to the search for peace. ``The danger of a new
cycle of civil war is very real,'' he said.
   He said Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former head of state in Cambodia
and now leader of non-communist guerrillas, is central to U.S. and
ASEAN goals of a comprehensive stable settlement, including
guarantees against the return to exclusive power of the brutal Khmer
Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge killed perhaps a million Cambodians before it was
ousted by Vietnam's invasion. It is now the largest guerrilla unit
in Sihanouk's coalition.
   Both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese invaders are communist.
   Appearing to give the pro-Vietnamese government of Premier Hun
Sen more stature than in previous official U.S. statements, Baker
said:
   ``Prince Sihanouk's efforts to work out a power-sharing agreement
with the Hanoi-sponsored Hun Sen regime are crucial to the
achievement of a viable political accord, and we urge our ASEAN
friends to use their unity to strengthen the prince's position as he
seeks to advance the process of national reconciliation.''
   The main barrier is refusal of the pro-Vietnam government to let
the Khmer Rouge join in a provisional four-party government. The
Khmer Rouge reportedly is storing arms for a major push once the
Vietnamese soldiers leave.
   Baker said Washington ``will stay engaged'' in the region as it
faces these and other challenges. ``East Asia is integral to
America's future,'' he said.
   Mitsuzuka also opposed what ASEAN officials now commonly refer to
as an ``Afghanistan-type solution.''
   He said that whatever the settlement, ``It cannot be accepted in
such an unstable character as might prolong the civil war in
Cambodia.''
   Mitsuzuka said it was imperative for the Cambodian parties to
work out a solution to ``forming a provisional politica plan for
implementation of the future general election, not only for the
internal stability of Cambodia but also for the security of all
neighboring countries.''
   He said reconstruction of postwar Cambodia will be a major issue
at the international conference on Cambodia in Paris.
   ``Japan believes we should all now consider establishment of an
International Committee for the Reconstruction of Cambodia as an
international cooperative framework,'' he said.
   He said that ``the very first thing this committee has to do may
be to dispatch a fact-finding mission.''
   Edwige Avice, France's deputy foreign minister and chief EEC
delegate here, said the international conference on Cambodia
probably will be held July 30. She said Sihanouk and his guerrilla
allies will hold talks in France July 24-25 with Hun Sen.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Seiichi Kondo said all
participants in Thursday's talks expressed support for Japan's
proposal on forming the body to rebuild Cambodia.
   Sihanouk earlier had sent the ASEAN ministers a letter in which
he wrote of the danger of a partial settlement.
   The statesmen here will discuss Cambodia and other issues
including trade friction and new Asia-Pacific economic cooperation
in sessions from Thursday to Saturday.

   An Air National Guard fighter

Thursday, killing a man on the ground after the two-man crew ejected
safely.
   An Air Force fighter crashed in southwest Alabama and the pilot
also safely ejected, the Air Force said.
   In California, the F-4C Phantom jet took off at 1:06 p.m. on a
routine training flight from this base 60 miles east of Los Angeles,
California National Guard Col. Ralph Marinaro said in Sacramento.
   ``The plane was 100 to 200 feet off the ground when the wing
dipped,'' Marinaro said. ``The pilot tried to compensate for it but
wasn't able to. The pilot and the crewman ejected. Both of them are
alive.''
   The unmanned jet then plummeted to the ground and struck a
National Guard vehicle, killing one man, critically injuring another
and slightly injuring a third, Marinaro said.
   The dead and injured were not identified pending notification of
relatives.
   The Air Force F-15 jet crashed around 3 p.m. near Lamison, Ala.,
a community about 80 miles southwest of Montgomery, according to an
Air Force statement.
   The fighter, based with the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing at Eglin
Air Force Base in northwest Florida, was on a training mission when
the crash occurred the Air Force said.
   ``The pilot did eject and he did get out of the plane OK,'' said
Staff Sgt. David Beaulieu, a spokesman for the fighter wing at
Eglin. ``As far as his condition, he's OK.''
   The pilot was the only person aboard.

   Janos Kadar, Hungary's leader from the
repression of 1956 through the liberalized ``goulash communism'' of
the 1970s, died Thursday at age 77.
   Kadar's career began in 1931 when he joined the then-illegal
Communist Party.
   Kadar achieved Central Committee membership in 1942, having spent
more than three years in prison on various political charges.
   When the Communists took over, he became interior minister in
Matyas Rakosi's Stalinist regime.
   Rakosi had Kadar arrested in 1951 on charges of espionage and
treason, but when Josef Stalin died in 1953, Rakosi's grip on power
began to slip. Kadar was freed and rehabilitated the next year.
   In October 1956, he took over the Communist Party and summoned
Soviet tanks to crushed the anti-Stalinist uprising led by Premier
Imre Nagy.
   Nagy was executed in 1958.
   Kadar was replaced as party general secretary in 1988. He later
lost his post as party chairman and membership in the party's
policy-setting Central Committee.

   A UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crashed
east of Seoul on Thursday night, killing one U.S. soldier and
injuring two others, U.S. military officials said.
   The military also said a Korean civilian was killed and two
others injured Thursday while U.S. troops were training at a firing
range.
   The helicopter was on a routine night training mission when it
crashed about 10 p.m. Thursday about 8{ miles east of Seoul,
according to a statement the military issued Friday.
   It said the cause of the crash was under investigation.
   The Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo, quoting witnesses, said the
aircraft went down when its blades hit a high voltage power line
about 500 yards above the ground.
   A unidentified Korean civilian was burned and slightly injured
when he tried to pull the injured soldiers from the fiery wreckage,
witnesses said.
   The names of the dead and injured were expected to be released
later in the day after their families were notified, a military
spokesman said.
   The aircraft belonged to the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd
Battalion, 2nd Aviation, according to the statement. The 2nd
Infantry Division is the only U.S. infantry unit stationed in South
Korea and includes about 15,000 troops.
   The death and injuries at the firing range also involved units
from the 2nd Infantry and occurred about 1{ miles south of the
demilitarized zone that separates communist North Korea from South
Korea, a military spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman said no Americans were hurt.
   A military statement said the accident occurred during a routine
training mission while units were using artillery fire. The
spokesman said the firing range is surrounded by a buffer zone that
is off-limits to civilians.

   The government is preparing to ban almost all
uses of asbestos, ending a decade-long debate over the health risk
posed by the cancer-causing substance in such items as brake linings
and water pipes, according to sources.
   The regulatory action, which will end the manufacture of most
asbestos products in three phases over the next seven years, was
expected to be announced by the Environmental Protection Agency
today.
   According to government and private sources who spoke on
condition they not be identified, the agency action will allow
asbestos to be a component in only a small number of items,
prohibiting its use over the next seven years in an estimated 94
percent of the products in which it currently can be found.
   Among those products are automobile brake pads and linings,
cement water distribution pipes, roofing shingles, floor and pipe
wrapping and other construction products.

   Longtime leader Janos Kadar, who rose to
power after the Soviets crushed the 1956 revolt and steered Hungary
through relative prosperity until hard times and liberals forced him
out, died today at age 77.
   The Communist who led Hungary for 32 years until last year _ but
ultimately came to symbolize stagnation and resistance to democratic
change _ died after a ``prolonged and grave illness,'' the state-run
MTI news agency said.
   Kadar was rushed to the hospital Monday with pneumonia and severe
breathing and circulatory problems.
   MTI said the ruling Communist Party ``informs the party
membership, and the entire Hungarian people, with profound sorrow
that comrade Janos Kadar died following a prolonged, grave illness
on Thursday July 6 at 9:16 a.m.''

   An outbreak of rapidly fatal bacterial infections
in at least four western states could mark the return of dangerous
strains of strep germs that mysteriously disappeared almost 50 years
ago, researchers reported today.
   The newly recognized illness, which doctors call streptococcal
toxic shock syndrome, can lead from a minor skin infection to death
in a day or two.
   Strep germs are common but usually result in relatively minor
illnesses, such as sore throats. More virulent forms of the microbes
were once frequent causes of life-threatening illnesses, including
scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. But for reasons unclear, the
dangerous strains of strep largely faded away in the early 1940s.
   In today's New England Journal of Medicine, doctors describe 20
cases of severe illness, including six deaths, that were seen
between 1986 and 1988 in Idaho, Montana, Utah and Nevada. They
believe the illness was caused by strep bacteria that produce
scarlatina toxin, the poison responsible for scarlet fever.

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and
Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward
Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, a
planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

<HEAD>State Handling of Skagway Lead Cleanup Comes Under Fire</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crews have removed tainted soil near
Skagway's ore terminal, but eight months after the discovery of
extremely high levels of lead in the town there is no plan for
cleaning homes, yards or Skagway Harbor.
   ``It's supposed to be a cleanup, but it's a half-hearted
effort,'' said Susan Fredricks, one of about a dozen of Skagway's
712 residents who in April formed ``Get the Lead Out,'' which is
pushing for a thorough cleanup.
   Two Anchorage-based environmental groups, the Alaska Center for
the Environment and Trustees for Alaska, last month asked the
federal government to take over the cleanup. They called the work so
far ``patently irresponsible.''
   Records indicate the effort has been ineffectual and marred by
illegality and lack of agreement among the four companies
responsible. The removal of soil near the terminal and railroad
tracks halted in May for the tourist season.
   Dick Stokes, regional supervisor of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation in Juneau, says the cleanup is going as
fast as possible considering its complexity, but has given the
companies until July 14 to agree on a plan for the terminal.
   Extremely high lead levels in the terminal's soil were revealed
last fall in tests conducted by terminal operator Bowhead Equipment
Co., which is under a federal order to stop polluting the harbor.
Further tests confirmed that the Gold Rush town's role as a mining
port had created an insidious byproduct.
   ``There's lead dust in people's carpets, on their window sills,
on their door sills, embedded in their beds and furniture,'' said
Kristine Benson, a soil scientist with the Alaska Center for the
Environment.
   The highest levels were at the terminal and railroad tracks,
where concentrations of 133,000 parts per million have been found.
Lead naturally is present in Skagway soil at about 50 ppm, and the
U.S. Environmental Protection has ordered cleanups elsewhere if
levels in soil exceeded 500-1,000 ppm.
   Lead also is in residents' blood, although state health officials
concluded in November that few had absorbed enough to pose a risk.
Environmentalists say that conclusion was based on an outdated
standard.
   Lead can cause headaches, anemia, colic, paralysis and cramps. It
also can stunt growth in children and cause birth defects.
   ``The symptoms are very subtle,'' Benson said. ``I don't think
anyone can say with any confidence that there have been no ill
effects in Skagway.''
   In any case, the DEC said a risk exists _ especially for children
_ and promised to remove the lead. Officials decided to clean the
terminal area first while testing to determine the extent of
contamination in residential areas.
   ``Our first priority was to cut off contamination from the
source,'' Stokes said, adding that Bowhead Equipment has been able
to prevent the ore from being spread through town by trucks and
released into the air during ship loading.
   Meanwhile, according to state records:
   _White Pass &amp; Yukon Route violated state law twice by leaving a
pile of contaminated soil uncovered and exposed to wind. Stokes, in
a letter, scolded a railroad official for failing to ``understand
the seriousness of the cleanup.'' No punitive action was taken, but
Stokes said the company will have to pay for the state's
investigation of the violations.
   _Soil has been removed twice from the east side of the terminal,
but tests after each found more than the target of 1,000 ppm of
lead. The area, traversed by cruise ship passengers until last
month, has been sealed.
   _Tests showed that the cleanup of a 10-foot corridor along the
railroad tracks also was insufficient.
   _White Pass had hoped to clean up to three miles of track before
summer, but did about a half-mile because of required soil tests and
documentation. The track is being used for a tourist excursion train
through the summer.
   In a letter to the EPA, the two environmental groups say DEC is
ill-equipped to monitor the cleanup, especially since the Exxon
Valdez oil spill consumed much of its resources. Stokes doubts the
EPA, which is on the steering committee, will take over. EPA
officials did not answer interview requests.
   The environmental groups also note that the state has not come up
with a comprehensive cleanup plan for the town about 100 miles north
of Juneau.
   White Pass Transportation Inc., the railroad's parent and
terminal owner, submitted a plan in January. Bowhead, Curragh
Resources Inc. and Yukon Alaska Transport submitted a plan in March.
Bowhead runs the terminal under contract with Curragh, a Canadian
mining company. Yukon Alaska trucks the ore.
   None of the plans suggests cleaning people's yards, homes or the
harbor. The four also have been unable to agree on responsibility
for the terminal.
   ``Perhaps I'm a little optimistic, but I think they'll find some
kind of understanding to complete the job at the ore terminal,''
Stokes said.
   ``The next question is whether they will work out among
themselves what to do with the residential section.''
   A deadline for them to address residential cleanup will be set in
the next few weeks, he said. That issue is the most likely to end up
in court.
   ``The companies are not going to volunteer to clean up indoors
because of this unknown of financial liabilities,'' he said. ``The
bottom line is we're looking at no soils to remain in place at no
greater than 500 ppm, unless there's some showing that those soils
are not likely to be redistributed.''
   The tentative minimum limit for inside homes also is 500 ppm, but
the residents' and environmental groups want it set at 50 ppm. Tests
of vacuum bag samples have shown levels up to 8,210 ppm, with the
highest near the terminal.
   ``From the studies I have read, 500 ppm in the environment has
been shown to produce lead levels in children which compromise
neuro-muscular development and red blood-cell production,'' resident
Lynne Smith wrote to DEC Commissioner Dennis Kelso. ``Please realize
this is not some abstract concept to us. It is a reality we live
with and look for in our children every day.''

<TEXT>
   The Medicine Bow Post gives folks
pretty much what they want from a hometown newspaper, but maybe not
what they expected when the weekly was donated to the University of
Wyoming.
   ``I think the biggest worry that they had was this was going to
be all university news,'' said Geoff Woodman, last year's student
editor. They were happy ``after they found out it was going to stay
their newspaper.''
   Dave Roberts founded the Post a dozen years ago to chronicle a
mining boom that has since gone bust. He's been keeping an eye on it
since giving it to the school last year. ``I think from the stories
that I see and from letters that I get from people in Medicine Bow
that they've kept it a hometown paper.''
   For Woodman and his staff of 11 students, that meant car-wash and
church announcements, news from around Wyoming and updates on the
nearby wind turbines _ the world's largest _ without pay or the
glamour of a big-city paper.
   ``It's pretty bleak in the winter time. There is a reason why the
two largest wind turbines in the world were constructed in Medicine
Bow,'' said Tom Hacker, a journalism instructor who had just 12
applicants for the first 12 staff positions and now has to choose
from many more.
   Under Hacker's guidance, the students _ acting as reporters,
editors, photographers and typesetters _ have pushed the tabloid's
circulation to 1,100 with stories centered on the life and times of
Medicine Bow's 300 residents and their neighbors. They also have
expanded its sports and feature coverage.
   ``The kids seem to reach out further. They're ambitious kids and
they're always looking for a good story,'' said Mayor Gerald Cook,
although admitting that some of the older residents think the
students should stay closer to home.
   ``I personally think the kids are doing a terrific job,'' Cook
said.
   The Post averages four to eight pages and covers Medicine Bow,
Rock River and Hanna, rural communities on U.S. 30 that have
stagnated since Interstate 80 was built to funnel motorists across
southern Wyoming.
   ``I think it's as much a benefit to them as it is to the
students,'' Roberts said.
   Woodman gets a semester's credit while living here to oversee the
Post's production; the other 11 students live on campus in Laramie
and make several trips a week along the 60 miles of two-lane highway
to Medicine Bow.
   They congregate in the lobby of the defunct Medicine Bow State
Bank on the edge of the two-street town devoid of trees and
fast-food restaurants. Dinner out means a trip to the Virginian
Hotel that inspired one of the pre-eminent novels of the Old West,
Owen Wister's ``The Virginian.''
   Inside the bank building, computer terminals sit near an antique
label printer used to address subscriptions. A primitive darkroom
occupies the vault, and the teller windows provide storage space for
back issues.
   The lack of a true newsroom doesn't detract from the students'
experience or efforts, Hacker said. ``I would be very surprised if
five years from now the Medicine Bow Post weren't an even more
important institution in that region.''
   Cook said the students are providing a valuable service by
keeping the paper alive, and publicity the unusual program has drawn
has boosted a sparse tourist trade. ``We got a little national media
and right now that helps.''
   The new publisher, the University of Wyoming, is getting an
unexpected benefit, as well, Hacker said. Publicity is attracting
more students and money to the department when there had been
reduced emphansis on journalism.
   When Roberts first offered to donate the Post, some university
trustees hesitated out of concern that it would draw talent from the
student newspaper, The Branding Iron. Instead, ``I think that we're
going to do a much better job ... of providing people for community
journalism jobs,'' Hacker said.
   Woodman, who hopes the Post will lead to a job on another
small-town newspaper, has come to enjoy life in a town where ``you
know everybody that you see on the street.'' He can't drive through
town without chatting with one of the 300 or so residents who stuck
around after the oil and gas boom busted.
   Michelle Kodis, who takes over as editor this summer, said the
benefits of the job outweigh the appeal of having a paid internship
with a big-city daily. ``I'd rather do this,'' she insisted. ``As an
intern with a large newspaper ... I don't think I would get to do
anything.''

<HEAD>Pleasant `Knight &amp; Daye' Gets Summer Run</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Everett Daye not-quite-fondly recalling his radio
partner of 30 years ago: ``I thought he was dead _ I hoped.''
   Not an unlikely sentiment, considering the fact that Everett Daye
tried to kill Hank Knight the last time they met. They had fought
over the woman who became Daye's wife.
   Mason Adams (``Lou Grant'') plays Daye and Jack Warden (``Heaven
Can Wait'') plays Knight and Hope Lange (``The Ghost and Mrs.
Muir'') plays Gloria Daye in this pleasant summer comedy from Lowell
Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (``Laverne &amp; Shirley,'' ``Splash'').
   ``Knight &amp; Daye'' premieres Saturday on NBC before moving into
its summer time period next Wednesday.
   In the premiere episode, Daye recalls the origins of the
partnership. Daye was a serious journalist, Knight a comic
entertainer. They were paired by an enterprising producer who
thought the names went nicely together _ ``Knight and Daye.''
   ``That described us,'' recalled Daye. ``I once got Eleanor
Roosevelt on the show. Hank lifted her up to guess her weight.''
   Wouldn't you know it _ an eager young station manager (Julia
Campbell) shows up hoping to reunite the pair on KLOP, the 16th
highest-ranked station in San Diego. ``How many radio stations are
there in San Diego,'' asks Daye. ``Seventeen,'' she says proudly.
``We beat out Airport Information _ finally!''
   To make matter more sitcomplex, the Dayes live with their
daughter, a zookeeper, and son-in-law, an exiled Cuban doctor, and a
crowd of grand-tykes.
   Mom explains to daughter Ellie (Lela Ivey) the circumstances of
the Knight and Daye rift, which occurred just before one of their
radio shows and precipitated an on-air fight. ``It was an hour of
uninterrupted vulgarity,'' she sighs. Ellie is appalled. ``Worse
than `Geraldo'?''
   Summer replacement shows get cut a little slack since we've come
to expect so little from the networks in the hazy days of low
viewing levels. ``Knight &amp; Daye'' is diversionary, but uneven. There
is the tiresome, but apparently de-riguer domestic upheaval as
Knight moves into the midst of the Daye brood. And the kids are too
choreographed-cute.
   Not enough is made of the reunion between the two basically
incompatible egotists. But Knight arrives in a hilariously bad
toupee and two-toned shoes to announce, when his eyes first light
upon Daye, ``While I am still an impressive-looking man, you have
aged incredibly!''
   And the pilot picks up when the dour Daye sheds his curmudgeonly
outer layer and begins to sparkle, recalling their halcyon days
together. There's no need for dialogue to explain why Gloria is
adamant that he take the radio job.
   Of course, there are some obstacles on the way to the reunion,
but the inevitable happens, or we would have no series.
   Adams and Warden are a delightful pair, and their on-air repartee
is credibly amusing. It is believable that people would tune in to
hear Daye complaining about the drug problem only to have Knight
gamely interject that, indeed, a bottle of Bufferin costs $4.59 at
the drugstore, but at the supermarket it's only $4.19.

   MISSISSIPPI STORY _ Tom Hulce (``Amadeus''), Blair Underwood
(``L.A. Law'') and Jennifer Grey (``Dirty Dancing'') have been cast
in the NBC movie ``Murder in Mississippi,'' based on the murders of
three civil rights workers who were killed by racists in 1964
because of their efforts to register black voters. Hulce plays
Mickey Schwerner, Grey plays Schwerner's wife and Underwood plays
James Chaney. No casting yet on the other civil rights worker who
was killed, Andrew Goodman. The murders inspired the largely
fictional feature film ``Mississippi Burning.'' The NBC movie will
focus on the relationships among the civil rights activists and
their activities up until the murders. ...
   THESE ARE THE GUYS _ Folk-singers-turned-jingle-writers Robin
Batteau and David Bushkin are profiled on this month's ``What I

<BYLINE>Do Bad Bonds Drive Out Good? ^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today, on the leading edge of modern, creative,
innovative financial and economic thinking, old Thomas Gresham isn't
always listened to, although he shouts loudly from the grave.
   His message is the same as it has been, ``Bad money drives out
good,'' and it applies today as it has since he stated it for the
first time in the 16th century, when he was an adviser to Queen
Elizabeth I.
   But Gresham's law is, for the most part, ignored. Like bad money,
a spate of experimental thinking, still unproved, has moved in where
sound reasoning, demonstrated over the years, has departed.
   Ignorance of the law, however, doesn't mean it has no
significance. Indeed, it's significance has been shown again as
surely as it was in Queen Elizabeth's day, when debasement of the
currency damaged England's foreign trade.
   For evidence of the modern application, you need only check what
happens to the once-secure bonds of sound companies after newer,
junk bonds are issued in a leveraged buyout _ the value of the old
bonds falls.
   James Creedon, president of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., a
major holder of existing RJR Nabisco bonds, can attest to their
sudden decline in market value. The drop occurred when the company
decided to undergo a junk bond-financed leveraged buyout last year.
Metropolitan has sued, so far without success, for reimbursement.
   Junk bonds are said by their supporters to be as good as any
other _ even better. Their promoters claim that nobody can (as yet)
demonstrate they are riskier. They pay very high yields to borrowers.
   They are issued by borrowers often to raise funds for a leveraged
buyout of a corporation or to take over another company. They carry
high rates because those who issue them can't otherwise raise the
money quickly.
   In the RJR Nabisco deal, Creedon claims the issuance of junk
bonds by companies that already have older, sounder bonds oustanding
turns upside down some basic legal concepts governing the extension
of credit.
   One of the most fundamental principles of corporate law, he said
in a recent speech, is that the claims of bondholders are superior
to the claims of shareholders.
   Thus, he said, ``if a corporation is liquidated, the assets would
be sold and the proceeds would be used to pay _ first, the
bondholders and other creditors, then the preferred shareholders
and, lastly, if anything is remaining, the common shareholders.''
   In the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout, he continued, substantially
all the company's net worth was paid out to its shareholders and the
bondholders received nothing.
   ``The payment to shareholders was funded by enormous levels of
new debt,'' he said. ``In effect, the interests of shareholders were
given priority over the interests of the bondholders.''
   Analyzing the situation, H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., states that the result was predictable:
The value of $5 billion of existing RJR debt plunged.
   Questions: What will future bond buyers say when salesmen ask
them to invest in corporate bonds? Will they merely ask what
protection they have from being destroyed by a sudden issuance of
junk bonds? Will they decline to buy? Will they demand higher rates
for assuming a greater risk?
   Said Heineman: ``When LBO players change the rules in the middle
of the game to suit their personal convenience (let alone their
personal pocketbooks), it's time for the public, taxpayers and
investors alike, to beware.''
   Said Creedon: ``High-quality, secure investments were turned into
a form of `junk.'''
   And from the grave you almost could hear Sir Thomas say, ``I
warned you: Bad money drives out good. It always has.''

<DATELINE>McALLEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen-wheelers filled with electronic
goods and auto parts rumble out of one of the nation's busiest
foreign trade zones and on past high-production farms.
   They roll past shiny aluminum trailer parks for retirees who pump
millions into the economy, past a busy mall and middle-class
neighborhoods.
   Welcome to the nation's poorest metropolitan area.
   The lowest per capita income of the 318 U.S. metropolitan areas
in 1987 _ $7,001 _ was in McAllen-Edinburg-Mission in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, where a boom is taking place amid rural slums where
thousands live in squalor.
   There are other measures of Hidalgo County's poverty: It has the
state's highest unemployment rate, and in March, it shut down its
indigent health care program when it ran out of money halfway
through the fiscal year.
   But local promoters say the gloomy statistics are misleading.
   ``We are a thriving little town,'' said Leonel Garza, president
of the McAllen Board of Realtors Inc. ``I keep hearing we're full of
poverty. I don't know how they figure it.''
   New industries, especially the border plants, maquiladoras, are
drawing so many people that housing values are on the rise. Garza's
group in a May survey found only three houses available for rent in
the city.
   More than $1 billion in goods a year pass through the foreign
trade zone, which has had to turn away tenants since its warehouses
filled up last year.
   Hidalgo County also is the No. 1 destination for 80,000 ``winter
Texans,'' retirees who spent about $161 million last year in
southern Texas.
   And retail sales in the area grew 22.6 percent last year _ faster
than any other part of the state.
   Those statistics also mislead, said economist J. Michael Patrick,
director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Economic Development
at Pan American University in Edinburg. ``Just because we see a lot
of activity in McAllen doesn't mean it's being translated to the
population in a broad sense.''
   The broader population he refers to is found largely in the rural
colonias, where developers have sold tiny home sites without water,
sewers or paved roads for as little as $100 down. A 1986 study for
the Texas Water Development Board found 52,000 people in 366
colonias in Hidalgo County, population 375,000.
   This time of year, many colonia residents are boarding up their
houses to travel north to harvest crops, continuing a cycle of
subsistence living.
   ``We have to get away from migrant work so there will be
stability in the families, so our children will have a full school
year, not half a year,'' said Carmen Anaya, who for 39 years has
lived south of Pharr in a colonia known as Las Milpas.
   The majority of colonia residents are U.S. citizens, said Mrs.
Anaya, who through Valley Interfaith, a coalition of churches, won
legislative approval this session of a $100 million appropriation
for colonia water and sewer installations. The bill was signed into
law by Gov. Bill Clement.
   ``Nobody has sewer service here,'' said Herlinda Hernandez, 65,
who lives with her husband in a cinder-block house in a colonia west
of Mission. Her daughter and grandchildren live in a plywood home in
the front of the same small lot on a street paved with caliche clay.
   Mrs. Hernandez has running water and a septic tank, but fears
that her grandchildren are exposed to chemicals from the
crop-dusting planes that spray a corn field behind her house.
   A neighbor down the street uses an antique wringer washing
machine, while children play in the dusty street.
   Many colonia residents have outhouses that overflow on rainy
days. Even when equipped with septic tanks, many yards end up with
contaminated soil due to poor drainage and lots too small to absorb
the waste.
   That leads to hepatitis, intestinal parasites and typhoid, said
Sister Christine Stephens, chief organizer for Valley Interfaith.
``They live on top of open sewers a lot of the time.''
   The working poor who have no health insurance and make too much
for public health care simply go without, resulting in undetected
cases of diabetes and high blood pressure, Stephens said.
   Like most border areas, prosperity in Hidalgo County is tied to
the maquiladoras, where U.S. products are assembled by Mexican
workers making about $1 an hour. The number of maquiladoras in
Reynosa, Mexico, across from McAllen, increased from 36 to 51
between November 1987 and November 1988, and added more than 5,000
new employees, according to the McAllen Economic Development Corp.
   Yet the county in April had Texas' worst unemployment rate _ 16.7
percent _ more than double the state average of 7 percent and a
point higher than the year before, according to the Texas Employment
Commission.
   The growing unemployment in the face of an industrial boom is
primarily due to a high birthrate and an influx of people into
Hidalgo County, said David Ruelas, Employment Commission labor
market analyst in McAllen.
   To bridge the gap, the McAllen Economic Development Corp. is
trying to attract maquiladora suppliers, companies that would
provide highly paid jobs for skilled labor, said President Mike
Allen.
   But many local communities have high school dropout rates of more
than 50 percent and a shortage of people with industrial experience.
That makes it hard to convince companies they can find people to
fill skilled positions in plastic injection molding and tool-and-die
operations, and most continue to send the supply orders north to
traditionally industrial parts of the United States.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Turns State Elections Into Abortion Battlefields</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This time, the election returns may follow the
Supreme Court, onto an abortion battlefield no candidate is likely
to escape without scars.
   President Bush expressed confidence that Americans will handle
the issue ``within the bounds of civility and our legal
institutions.''
   That may be wishful confidence.
   Abortion is not a subject that fosters civil discourse. Not even
in the chambers of the Supreme Court, where black-robed justices
bitterly denounced one another in the July 3 decision permitting
state restrictions on abortion. And certainly not in the streets.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist said dissenting colleagues had
accused his 5-4 majority of cowardice and illegitimacy. In angry
dissent, Justice Harry Blackmun said the decision invites
constitutional crisis for the nation and brutal consequences for
women who would defy laws against abortion.
   The shouting and shoving started almost at once, in
demonstrations scattered around the country, with confrontations
that can only escalate.
   Both sides said they would demand that every state legislator,
indeed every candidate for office, take a public position on
abortion. To the rival activists, that single issue overrides
everything else in judging a candidate.
   After a politically popular decision at the turn of the century,
Finley Peter Dunne, the Chicago columnist, wrote that the Supreme
Court follows the election returns.
   That observation may be reversed on abortion, which Blackmun
called ``the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of our
time.'' There is no safe side for office-holders, office-seekers,
even for judges.
   Justice Antonin Scalia said the court should overturn its 1973
abortion rights ruling, get out of the way and let the political
system deal with the issue.
   For 16 years, since the court held that a woman has a right to
terminate a pregnancy, opponents of abortion have been campaigning
intensively, sometimes defying the law to barricade abortion
clinics, sometimes shouting down candidates.
   They were on the offense, demanding a constitutional amendment
against abortion.
   Now the court has opened another path to their objective,
permitting state restrictions and hinting that it may eventually
reverse its 1973 abortion decision. So they will lobby and
demonstrate for restrictive state laws and also will put the issue
before the courts in as many versions as possible.
   Abortion rights organizations saw the handwriting of an
increasingly conservative Supreme Court and began mobilizing in
anticipation of court setbacks. Now they will try to make the issue
central in every legislature and every election.
   The first arenas will be the closely divided Florida Legislature,
to be summoned to special session by a Republican governor bent on
restricting abortion; and the Nov. 7 elections in New Jersey and
Virginia, which are electing governors and legislators. In both
states the Republican gubernatorial nominees oppose abortion, the
Democrats support abortion rights.
   While the issue is too personal, with too much intramural dissent
for party lines to hold clearly, national Democratic policy is to
favor abortion rights while the Republican Party opposes abortion.
   The 1988 Democratic platform declares that ``the fundamental
right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of
ability to pay.'' The Republican platform, tailored to the position
Bush adopted as Ronald Reagan's vice presidential nominee, supports
an anti-abortion constitutional amendment and opposes the use of
public funds for abortion.
   Supreme Court opinions and dissents in the abortion ruling
forecast the coming fights. Scalia said the court had prolonged its
``self-awarded sovereignty over a field where it has little proper
business.''
   Scalia said that ``the answers to most of the cruel questions
posed are political, not juridical.'' He said that by stopping short
of reversal, the court made itself ``the object of the sort of
organized public pressure that political institutions in a democracy
ought to receive.''
   ``We can now look forward to at least another term with carts
full of mail from the public and streets full of demonstrators,
urging us ... to follow the popular will,'' Scalia said.
   Blackmun said in his dissent that the decision ``implicitly
invites every state legislature to enact more and more restrictive
abortion regulations in order to provoke more and more test cases.''
   The Supreme Court will consider three more abortion cases later
this year, following on what Scalia scorned as an indecisive
decision.
   That probably will escalate the battle. But perhaps, eventually,
the political system will shape answers acceptable to the majority
of Americans.

   He was one of professional football's mightiest
men, a 295-pound monster who could bench press twice his weight.
Now, Steve Courson is thrilled to lift 15-pound dumbbells and climb
a flight of stairs.
   The former offensive lineman, now only 33 years old, suffers from
cardiomyopathy, a mysterious disease that turns heart muscle into
flab and eventually kills its victims unless they undergo a
transplant.
   Though his doctors can't blame Courson's condition on his long,
heavy use of anabolic steroids, they can't rule it out. Neither can
he.
   ``There are so many ironies about my situation. That's why I
can't discard them as being an accident. Why is all this ironically
happening to me? I've had two strikes. Strike three you're out.''
   Courson, formerly of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, is believed to be the first professional athlete to be
put on the waiting list for a heart transplant after years of taking
illegally obtained anabolic steroids.
   Experts fear more may follow.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised. I think it's going to happen,'' said
transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh. ``It might be liver disease that comes out of those
things, too.''
   ``The potential health hazard and the impact on the national
health care system ... it's very frightening,'' said Harvard
University's Dr. Lyle Micheli, president of the American College of
Sports Medicine.
   It also raises an ethical question for transplant surgeons: With
a scarcity of organs, should people who take harmful drugs be given
lower priority?
   Anabolic steroids, fast becoming the scourge of sports, are
derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone. They stimulate
development of bone, muscle and skin. Admitted users include
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, whose 1988 Olympics gold medal was
withdrawn after he tested positive for the drugs.
   Courson first took anabolic steroids in 1974 before his sophomore
year at the University of South Carolina. In four weeks, he went
from 230 pounds to a solid 260. He continued the off-season habit
after being drafted by the Steelers in 1977 and playing on two Super
Bowl teams.
   Not long after being traded to the Buccaneers in 1984, Courson
boasted a 60-inch chest and 22-inch biceps and was pressing up to
605 pounds. ``Anyone who's trained with weights or trained that
seriously at world-class level realizes those types of gains don't
occur by eating Wheaties.''
   At one point, Courson was shelling out $1,500 a year for
steroids, ``not that big a tradeoff when you're making $300,000 a
year,'' he said.
   In March 1985, in the midst of an 1,800 milligram-a-week regimen,
his highest ever, Buccaneers doctors told him he had an irregular
heartbeat. The problem cleared up in two weeks with medication, and
Courson quit taking steroids for the next year.
   At the end of the 1985 season, Courson lost his starting job. He
took his last dose of anabolic steroids before the Buccaneers'
training camp in 1986 in hopes of getting off the bench. ``I wanted
to maintain a competitive edge and I realize it had to do with my
age, too, the wear and tear on the body.''
   Courson was waived at the start of the season, got no other
offers, and retired. He lived in Wyoming and Florida, then returned
to the Pittsburgh area in early 1988 to finish his autobiography and
train as a professional wrestler.
   On Nov. 23, 1988, Courson went to Allegheny General Hospital for
what he thought was an ulcer. It turned out to be cardiomyopathy.
   For years, doctors have warned of the immediate side effects of
steroids: acne, sexual dysfunction, rashes and unusually aggressive
behavior known in the trade as ``'roid rage.'' Less is known about
long-term effects, although animal tests suggest the drugs
accelerate cardiovascular disease.
   ``Anybody who's used steroids and has any malady, it's
immediately assumed steroids caused it. We haven't even done those
studies yet,'' said Dr. Charles Yesalis of Pennsylvania State
University.
   ``We don't know frankly what is the bottom line,'' said Dr.
Judith Orie, Courson's cardiologist. ``But we do know anabolic
steroids cause high blood pressure in patients. High blood pressure
after a point in time causes the heart to fail.''
   Also, ``steroids can alter the immune system. We don't know
whether that has played a role and allowed a virus to affect his
heart or not,'' Orie said.
   Complicating matters is the fact that doctors don't always know
what causes cardiomyopathy.
   ``There are many people who have cardiomyopathy and had nothing
to do with steroids,'' said Dr. Barry Maron of the National
Institutes of Health. ``That's the problem there is in establishing
a connection in this one person. It's a very iffy kind of thing
(although) I'm not saying it's impossible.''
   About 40 percent of all heart transplants are performed on
cardiomyopathy patients, said Dr. Michael Kaye of the University of
California at San Diego, who keeps the international registry of
heart, heart-lung and lung transplants, which stood at 11,181 in
late June. The vast majority _ 10,154 _ were straight heart
transplants.
   There were 1,223 people awaiting heart transplants in the United
States as of June 26, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing.
   ``The transplant community is concerned (about steroids) because
of the tremendous need for organs and lack of donors,'' Kaye said.
   Courson, who has been on the list since March 31, could wait a
long time because of his body size. Doctors give him two years
without a transplant.
   Experimental heart medication has enabled the 6-foot-1{ Courson
to go from an all-time adult low of 225 pounds late last year to 255
pounds. It has also allowed him to stay in shape by walking
treadmills and lifting light weights three times a week at Allegheny
General's cardiac rehabilitation laboratory.
   Because of the scarcity of organs, some people quietly wonder
whether former steroid users should get the same priority as
individuals who never took illicit drugs. Transplant doctors,
however, say they merely take into account patients' current
lifestyles and ability to maintain healthy habits.
   Cigarette smokers and alcoholics, for instance, usually are told
they must stop before they can be considered for transplantation.
That's no guarantee, however, that they will stop for good.
   Arthur McDonald Sr., 53, of Schenectady, N.Y., ended a 30-year
cigarette habit before being put on the heart transplant waiting
list at Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh. About a year
after his 1985 transplant, he was smoking again. He says he plans to
quit as soon as he loses 30 more pounds.
   ``They weren't very happy. I'm not happy with myself,'' he said.
``You've got a second chance at life and the cigarettes aren't going
to add to it.''
   Doctors say they extract a promise and hope for the best.
   ``We really need that commitment,'' Starzl said. ``But just
because someone drank in the past, just because Steve Courson once
took steroids so he could compete, I don't believe should be
determining factors.
   ``I think he's been punished plenty.''
   Courson feels no shame or guilt being on the waiting list.
   ``Everyone's got their faults. But when you were doing something
that you got paid for and was glorified, are you totally to be
blamed?''

<TEXT>
   I woke up this morning after a night of killing pain.
   I went to the practice field to deal with it again.
   My coach, he tells me, ``Fight hard and be a man!''
   But with his chalk board theories we all wonder if he can?
   So knock 'em down, block 'em hard and strive to win the fight.
   I wonder why they're so concerned, is it economic plight?
   The battle in the trenches, won and lost, and who does realize
   but the gladiator in its midst whose soul in anguish cries.
   The battle fought, the game is won, and victor duly glorified.
   But the sad fact, businessman, is the sporting soul has died.
   In the end in retrospect what's glorified and gained
   but the almighty dollar, not the spirit of the game.

   Wires as thick as molecules, ``grown''
in rocks containing microscopic channels, could yield tiny,
three-dimensional chips that could be tightly packed into small
computers, a researcher says.
   ``We cannot claim yet that we have electron flow along these
chains, but we have essentially done the first step to make these
systems,'' said Thomas Bein, a University of New Mexico chemist who,
with doctoral candidate Patricia Enzel, grew chains of organic
molecules in the channels of a mineral called zeolite.
   The channels in zeolite are 3 to 12 angstroms wide. An angstrom
is one-tenth of a billionth of a meter. Etched wires on silicon
microchips are about 1 micron, one-25,000th of an inch or one
millionth of a meter.
   Crystals of zeolite _ Greek for ``boiling stone'' _ are believed
to form in volcanoes under high heat and pressure, Bein said. ``They
seem to boil because they contain water in their channels in
nature.''
   Synthetic zeolites are used as filters in such industries as oil
refining because they have a large surface area and their channels
can either absorb or reject different-sized molecules, he said.
   ``I think he's made a substantial advance here,'' said Mark
Ratner, a Northwestern University chemist who had heard about, but
had not read, Bein's research. He described it as ``growing a wire
in a mineral.''
   ``One of the problems has been how to get these things to
structure properly because they are floppy, kind of like boiled
spaghetti,'' Ratner said. ``The advantage of using zeolites is they
are stones _ they're hard, rigid, well-designed structures with
pores in them.''
   If molecular wires can be grown in zeolites, ``you would be
solving the addressing problems, telling the wire where to go,'' he
said.
   Bein said he and Enzel used synthetic zeolite crystals, each
about 1 micron in diameter _ in their research, which was presented
during an April meeting of the American Chemical Society in Dallas.
   Thousands of crystals, in the form of a powder, where placed in a
quartz reactor the size of a large cigar and heated to 400 degrees
Celsius to remove water vapor from the channels. The crystals were
cooled in a vacuum to keep the channels empty so vapors of an
organic substance called aniline could be used to coat the interior
walls of the channels. An oxidant caused the aniline to link into
chains of polyaniline, which is known to conduct electricity.
   ``Other conducting polymers also have been encapsulated in the
crystals, including polypyrrole and polythiophene,'' Bein said. More
research is needed to determine the length of the linked molecules
so a current can be hooked up.
   Some zeolites contain parallel channels, while others contain
networks of channels like hallways and rooms, Bein said. ``We have a
whole shopping list of about 200 structures with different pore
sizes and types of networks.''
   A step after controlling the chemistry in the channels and
determining electrical flow would be to ``introduce active
components like storage of bits or switching ...'' and then to ``try
to put information in and get information out of these assemblies,''
Bein said. ``Then we could create a very dense computer at a
molecular level, and that's what excites us so much.''

<TEXT>
   A Russian fish that feasts on aquatic
plants has made friends in America by clearing fishhook- and
propeller-snagging weeds.
   The white amur, a native of large rivers in Russia and China, was
introduced to the United States in 1963. The long, slender fish
commonly known as the grass carp has proven effective in controlling
underwater and floating weeds, said Tim Murphy of the University of
Georgia Extension Service.
   ``They do an excellent job of cleaning a pond by eating the
vegetation,'' said Paul Williams, co-owner of a hatchery that
produces the long, slender fish. ``It's going to open up ponds and
streams that are unusable.''
   South Carolina's Water Resources Commission plans to stock Lake
Marion, a major recreational area, with 300,000 grass carp over a
three-year period. The agency has been able to eliminate some weeds
with chemicals, but not hydrilla, which has closed large sections of
the 110,000-acre lake.
   ``Grass carp are known to feed on hydrilla,'' noted Danny
Johnson, director of the commission's surface water division.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority has asked Congress to fund a weed
control program for its 68,000-acre Lake Guntersville in
northwestern Alabama. The plan includh
California's Long Valley.
   The chamber is believed to hold about 200 cubic miles of molten
rock at temperatures as high as 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, according
to Sandia National Laboratory researchers who plan to drill 2,500
feet in 60 days during the first phase of the experiment, scheduled
to begin Aug. 1.
   Phase two, next summer, will extend the hole to 6,500 feet. The
third phase, in 1991, will go to 14,000 feet, and the final phase,
in 1992, will go to 20,000 feet or until the temperature hits 930
degrees. The final step is to bore through molten and partially
molten rock with a bit that sprays some sort of liquid to clean the
bit and cool the rock to drillable consistancy.
   Fluid would continue to be flushed through the well and through
fractures in the solidified magma, possibly generating high-pressure
steam that would be used to drive turbine generators at ground level.
   Scientists don't know if magma is a practical source of energy.
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates magma bodies buried within six
miles of the surface contain up to 500,000 quads of energy. Each
quad, a guadrillion British thermal units, is equal of 172 million
barrels of oil.
   ``One of the big unknowns is at what depth does magma reside
under Long Valley,'' said Sandia project manager James Dunn. Seismic
readings suggest the top of the magma chamber is about 4] miles deep.
   The Long Valley caldera is a collapsed, 700,000-year-old volcano
in Inyo National Forest in east-central California. The well will be
drilled within the caldera on top of a low, rounded hill that has
bulged up from the caldera floor because of the magma pressing from
below.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Researcher Gets Hand From Salamanders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Patrick knows many of his 3,000
test subjects by sight. Others he's had to mark with dye.
   Patrick, a Virginia Polytechnic Institute biologist, uses
salamanders to study the effects of acid rain. Because their skins
aren't waterproof, he said, ``Acid rain goes right into them, unlike
most other vertebrates. That makes them much more sensitive to acid
rain than, say, a bird or a mammal.''
   Some 40 species of salamander live in the central Appalachians,
more than anywhere else in the world. Patrick has dye-marked or
photographed 3,000 of the amphibians over six years so he can
identify and track them in the wild.
   Ireland, who travels the streams, springs and mountains of
Virginia, eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, says acid
rain _ especially the sulfur in it _ has reduced the salamanders'
growth rate about 14 percent.
   The acid in acid rain contains of sulfur and hydrogen, he said.
``I've found that for salamanders it's the sulfur that is equally
bad or worse than the hydrogen. The acid part, the hydrogen, is
easily neutralized by a lot of components in soil. My work is
showing that the sulfates are a big problem and there is nothing in
soil to get rid of that.''
   Acid rain in bodies of water often is gauged by pH levels, which
test their acidity and not sulfur, he said. ``Very often you find
that the hydrogen might not be too high, but you can still have a
lot of sulfates.''

<HEAD>Dental Laser Is Latest In Pain-Free Cavity Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A laser beam that vaporizes pockets of tooth
decay treats cavities without drilling, anesthesia or pain, a
researcher says.
   When it was used on 100 teeth with cavities or shallow decay, 95
percent of the patients reported feeling nothing, said dentist
Richard Klein. The others reported a brief warmth or tingle that was
not uncomfortable.
   Klein, of Madison Heights, Mich., spoke at a recent news
conference for a dental laser developed by Sunrise Technologies Inc.
of Sunnyvale, Calif. The device has been sold in other countries
since December, but is not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for general use in the United States, said company
chairman Arthur Vassiliadis.
   Another alternative to standard drilling, called Caridex, gained
FDA approval five years ago. That system uses a liquid to dissolve
decayed tissue, greatly reducing the need for drilling, its
developers say.
   Klein, who has used Caridex, said the laser works faster.
   The laser beam is aimed with a handpiece that resembles that for
a drill. Its rapid pulses are absorbed by decayed tissue, which
vaporizes. But healthy tissue does not absorb the light and so
remains unaffected.
   The process takes longer than regular drilling, said Klein, who
charges an extra $5 to $20, depending on how long it takes. He also
said the current model could not replace the drill completely
because it cannot penetrate fillings or crowns, nor get through
tooth enamel to reach cavities between teeth.
   Robert M. Pick, assistant clinical professor of periodontics at
the Northwestern University Dental School in Chicago, said more
research is needed on the laser's potential for treating cavities.
It may not be as effective as the drill for deep cavities, although
it will be with further development.
   Pick said the laser should be helpful in other applications
because it sterilizes tissue _so it may lower the chance of
infection after root canal surgery and promote healing after a gum
disease treatment called curettage.
   The FDA has approved another type of dental laser that can remove
benign tumors and other soft tissues without bleeding, and with
minimal or no pain after surgery, he said.

<HEAD>Consumer Optimism Continues, Conference Board Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high level of consumer optimism persists
despite indications of slower economic growth, the Conference Board
says.
   The board said Wednesday that its Consumer Confidence Index was
117.5 in June, little changed from May. Consumer confidence has held
at a relatively high level since late last year, although buying
plans are declining, according to the Conference Board, a business
research group.
   The monthly survey covered 5,000 households throughout the United
States.
   It found a small decline, to 28.7 percent, in the number of
consumers who believe current business conditions are good, and a
slight rise, to 17 percent, in those who believe they are bad.
   Consumer opinion continues to be positive on the issue of job
availability, the survey showed.
   ``Job security and the sustained buying power of the weekly
paycheck are contributing substantially to the consumer's sense of
well being,'' said Fabian Linden, executive director of the
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. ``As long as the
consumer remains in good spirits, there is faint likelihood that the
economy will take a bad turn.''
   With the big spring car sales over, households planning to buy an
automobile in the next six months dropped to 6.5 percent in June
from 8.5 percent in May. Around 3.2 percent of the respondents plan
to purchase a home, down from 3.4 percent a month earlier.
   The survey also noted a mild loss of interest in buying major
appliances.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. says it has entered
into a contract with Intercontinental Energy Corp. to supply two
power plants to be built in the Northeast.
   The $600 million undertaking is the largest single financing
project in the United States in the independent power and
cogeneration field, Westinghouse said Wednesday. Chase Manhattan
Bank of New York structured and underwrote the financing, and
syndicated it to a group of 10 banks.
   Last year, Chase structured, underwrote and arranged two
comparable financings for a combined total of $675 million to build
two power plants in the Southwest for Texas-New Mexico Power Co.
Chase also worked with Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse on that project.
   Westinghouse will manage the latest project to completion,
including the design, construction, testing and startup of the two
combined-cycle plants in Bellingham, Mass., and Sayreville, N.J.
   The 300-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plants will be built on
parallel construction schedules. Commercial operation is expected to
begin in 1991.
   Westinghouse will manage the operation of both plants under
10-year contracts.
   Power generated by the Bellingham station will be bought by
Boston Edison Co, Montaup Electric Co. and Commonwealth Electric Co.
The plant will provide process steam to an adjacent carbon dioxide
production facility.
   Jersey Central Power &amp; Light will buy all power generated by the
Sayreville facility. The plant will supply process steam to Hercules
Inc.
   ``As the nation acts to meet its future energy needs, the
construction and financing of projects like Intercontinental will
assume increasing importance,'' said William D. Rockford, Chase's
managing director for project finance. ``Chase stands ready to work
with the energy industry to further the effort.''
   Intercontinental is a project developer owned by the Roy family
of Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Labor Secretary Asks $14.8 Million Boost For OSHA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has asked Congress to
boost the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's budget by
$14.8 million to allow the agency to retain 179 workers it is slated
to lose.
   Current plans call for OSHA to lose the employees next fiscal
year when California returns its worker-safety protections to the
supervision of a state agency, which will get 50 percent of its
funds from the federal government.
   The federal share of the cost of the California program will be
roughly $14.8 million and OSHA is to lose the 179 positions now
assigned to work that will be taken over by the state.
   But Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole proposed boosting OSHA's
budget by the amount needed to pay for the California program and
allow OSHA to relocate the California positions elsewhere in the
country.
   ``OSHA should retain and redeploy the 179 positions,'' Mrs. Dole
said Wednesday in a statement. She said OSHA's jurisdiction and
responsibilities have expanded in recent years without corresponding
boosts in staff size.
   Mrs. Dole made the request in letters to Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
and Rep. William H. Natcher, D-Ky., chairmen of the Senate and House
subcommittees with jurisdiction over OSHA's budget.
   OSHA currently has about 2,400 workers, according to agency
spokesman Roy Clason. Including the money Mrs. Dole requested
Wednesday, its proposed budget for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1,
is $268 million, he said.

   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. has been granted a
permanent waiver to Federal Communications Commission rules that
could have forced the company to sell multimillion-dollar radio and
television stations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San
Francisco, the commission said.
   The commission announced Wednesday that it granted Capital
Cities' request that it be allowed to own WABC-TV, WABC-AM and
WPLJ-FM in New York City; WLS-TV, WLS-AM and WYTZ-FM, Chicago;
KABC-TV, KABC-AM and KLOS-FM, Los Angeles; and KGO-TV and KGO-AM,
San Francisco.
   In March, the FCC loosened cross-ownership rules that prohibited
a company from owning both a radio station and a television station
in the same television ``market,'' such as in the New York or Los
Angeles metropolitan areas.
   The commission said it would look favorably upon waiver requests
involving radio and television station combinations in the largest
25 television markets in the country.
   It would grant waivers if there were more than 30 separately
owned, operated and controlled broadcast licensees, or ``voices,''
after the proposed combination, the commission said.
   In a 3-0 ruling made June 30 and issued Wednesday, the commission
said Capital Cities had shown the stations were located in four of
the five largest markets in the country. The commission said Cap
Cities had shown there are 94 separate broadcast owners in New York
City, 79 in Los Angeles, 105 in Chicago and 57 in San Francisco.
   The FCC in 1985 had granted Capital Cities and ABC an 18-month
waiver to the so-called one-to-a-market rule when the two media
companies proposed a $3.5 billion merger.
   The commission had anticipated that the two companies would sell
off radio and television stations to meet FCC requirements, which
also stipulated that one company could own TV stations that reached
no more than 25 percent of the viewing public.
   The two companies owned 12 TV stations and 24 radio stations, and
before the merger was completed in January 1986 they sold four TV
stations, eight radio stations and Capital Cities' cable television
division for a total price of about $1 billion.
   Among the sales were: WTNH-TV, New Haven, Conn., sold for $170
million; WXYZ-TV, Detroit, and WFTS-TV, Tampa, Fla., $246 million;
and WKBW-TV, Buffalo, N.Y., $65 million.
   But before the 18-month waiver period expired, the commission
announced it was considering allowing common ownership in the larger
TV markets. Capital Cities requested another extension of the
temporary waiver, and then the request for a permanent waiver its
holding in the four large markets.
   ``Granting Capital Cities-ABC's request ... clearly meets the
standards adopted in the multiple ownership proceeding,'' the
commission said, adding that ``permitting radio-television
combinations in the top 25 markets with many competing voices
generally would not undermine the benefits derived from (the FCC's)
traditional pro-competitive and diversity policies.''

   An economic recession in Israel is taking a
heavy toll on jobs, sparking angry protests from laid-off workers
and a rising chorus of calls for government help.
   But the hard-pressed Finance Ministry _ already grappling with a
widening budget deficit and higher army spending to deal with the
Palestinian uprising _ has been hesitant to come to the rescue.
   The nation's unemployment rate has climbed to 8.6 percent, and
Rabbi Moshe Zeev Feldman, the deputy labor minister, says it could
hit a 20-year high of 10 percent by year's end if no action is
taken. Feldman says more than 132,000 Israelis are out of work.
   The most dramatic protest involved 20 mayors from development
towns, who chained themselves to the gate outside Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's office last weekend to demand relief for unemployed
residents and their own cash-strapped municipal coffers.
   They later set up tents across from the Prime Ministry and
threatened to camp there until their demands were met.
   The development towns were set up to attract Jewish immigrants to
rural areas, but many of their local factories have been closed or
forced to cut workers in the economic downturn.
   Yehiel Zohar, council leader from Netivot in the southern Negev
Desert, said unemployment was twice the national average. Declining
tax revenues and rising costs have pushed the town budget $3.5
million into the red, he said.
   ``People are desperate, and we have nowhere else to go,'' Zohar
said.
   About 140 workers, including many recently demobilized soldiers,
blocked streets in the northern town of Beit Shean this week to
protest losing jobs on archaeological sites. Employees laid off by
electronics and defense contractors also have picketed there.
   And in Tel Aviv, tax men raided the Tel Aviv Museum, which owes
nearly $1 million in back taxes. The Jerusalem Post said the tax
squad planned to confiscate 100 paintings but settled for
televisions, typewriters and other office equipment after museum
officials said a court order was needed to take the artwork.
   The city has said it cannot rescue the museum, and 30 percent of
the museum staff may be laid off.
   Israeli analysts predict a slow economic turnaround.
   ``The recession seems to be bottoming out now,'' said Yacov
Sheinin of Economic Models Inc. in Tel Aviv. ``It will be a slow
comeback, but I think by the beginning of 1990, the performance will
be much better.''
   He predicted the economy, after two lackluster years, could grow
about 4 percent next year. But he said factories would be slow to
rehire, ``meaning we'll probably face a high rate of unemployment
through 1990 and into 1991.''
   The unemployment rate in Israel was 5.6 percent of the work force
at the start of the recession in late 1987.
   The economic downturn coincided with the start of the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Tourism and foreign investment declined sharply. An Arab boycott
cut the sale of Israeli goods to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, one
of Israel's leading export markets, and tax collection in the Arab
sector remains at a low level. Thousands of Arab workers also left
jobs in Israel, hitting industries such as construction and textiles
particularly hard.
   The army last month asked for an additional $210 million to cover
the cost of fighting the uprising, and Finance Minister Shimon Peres
warned that it may have to be balanced with cuts in non-military
programs.
   Peres has been trying to hold to the economic austerity program
he put in place on Jan. 1 to stem the rising budget deficit.
   He has devalued the shekel three times against the dollar, from
1.6 to 2 shekels; cut government subsidies on food and fuel; and
resisted ministry calls for higher spending.
   But in an economy that traditionally has turned to the government
to get it through rough times, Peres has been forced to make
concessions to help ailing state-supported institutions.
   He has agreed to a $2.6 billion bail-out program for the nation's
ailing kibbutz collective farms and a $50 million loan to the
Histadrut-controlled Koor industrial conglomerate, which was
threatened with bankruptcy.
   Earlier this week, the Parliament passed a $9 million
loan-guarantee program to assist more than 130 recession-weakened
companies. A proposal put forward to assist the development towns
has been estimated by the Finance Ministry at $150 million.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Eastern Two-Week Extension To File Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines has won a two-week
reprieve for finishing a reorganization plan before competing
proposals may be filed.
   At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
granted the joint request by Eastern and its major creditors for an
extension of the company's exclusivity period through July 21, after
they indicated they were nearing agreement on a restructuring plan.
   ``We're making progress, although we're not there at the
moment,'' said Joel Zweibel, the attorney representing Eastern's
major creditors.
   In granting the request, Lifland said, ``There have been few
windows of opportunity in this case. I certainly view the present
period as a real window of opportunity.''
   Miami-based Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection from
creditors on March 9, five days after the start of a crippling
strike by the Machinists union that has been supported by most
pilots and flight attendants.
   A company seeking Chapter 11 protection has the sole right to
submit a reorganization plan to the court during the first 120 days
of its case, after which other parties may propose plans. Eastern's
exclusivity period had been due to end Friday.
   Eastern wants to rebuild as a smaller carrier and pay off
creditors with the proceeds of about $1.8 billion in asset sales,
including several that already have been approved by the bankruptcy
court.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., said
Friday that only technical differences regarding the plan remained
between the company and its creditors.
   But Zweibel said after the hearing that two ``substantive''
issues, which he declined to identify, still were unresolved.
   ``We hope that they'll be resolved within two weeks,'' Zweibel
said in an interview. He said the speed of Eastern and the creditors
in devising a reorganization plan was ``unprecedented'' for a large,
complex bankruptcy case.
   Also at the hearing, David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed
bankruptcy examiner for Eastern, said contract negotiations were
continuing in Washington between the airline's management and its
striking pilots, as ordered by Lifland.
   For about a week, Shapiro has been trying to get the two sides to
reach an agreement that would end the pilots' walkout. He did not
disclose details of the talks, saying only that they would be
broadened Monday to include Eastern's other two striking unions.
   But sources close to the talks, speaking anonymously, said little
progress has been made and only minor issues have been addressed so
far.
   Pilots union officials insist that job-security provisions are
necessary for an agreement. Eastern recently sought bankruptcy court
permission to cancel its contract with the Air Line Pilots
Association and to impose about $50 million in wage and benefit
concessions. The airline also is seeking changes in work policies
that would allow it to increase pilots' flying hours.

<BYLINE>Estimates: OPEC Production Rose To Year's Highest In June</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>

   OPEC nations boosted their crude oil
production in June to its highest level so far this year, surpassing
the cartel's self-imposed output ceiling, according to estimates.
   The International Energy Agency said Wednesday in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries pumped about 21.3 million barrels of crude a day last
month, up 200,000 barrels a day from May.
   The rise lifted second-quarter production to about 21 million
barrels a day, topping OPEC's self-imposed 18.5 million-barrel daily
production limit. It also was the highest for the April-June period
since the 23.2 million barrels a day produced in that quarter of
1981.
   The OPEC nations last month set their production ceiling at 19.5
million barrels a day for the last six months of the year _ up 1
million barrels from the first-half quota _ in an attempt to support
an $18 benchmark price for a ``basket'' of Middle Eastern crude oil.
The basket price is a composite of seven different crudes.
   OPEC's argument is that by giving member countries higher quotas,
they will be less likely to cheat and exceed the limits.
   The ministers agreed to divide up the extra sales proportionately
among all members, angering Kuwait and others that wanted a bigger
share of the increase. Kuwait has stated it would not be bound by
its individual quota.
   The energy agency _ a body of the multi-nation Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development _ predicted demand for OPEC oil
would be about 20.9 million barrels a day in the second half of the
year, about the same as the May forecast.
   Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets in New York, predicted OPEC in July would produce 20.5
million to 21 million barrels a day.
   He said oil stocks already were high and demand was likely to
slow, which could keep prices under downward pressure.
   The average price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
was $17.62 a barrel at the end of June, sharply up from $12.34 at
the end of November.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, closed at $20.79 a barrel Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, up 52 cents from Friday's close. The market was
closed Monday and Tuesday for the Independence Day holiday.
   OPEC has said data from nearly all its members shows they
generally are adhering to their targets. The organization measures a
nation's quota by figuring crude production and the amount of oil
put into, or drawn out, of stocks.
   The energy agency estimated Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 crude
exporter, produced 4.8 million barrels a day in June, compared with
its OPEC quota of 4.5 million barrels a day.
   ``The major increase was in Iran, which was up 300,000 barrels a
day (from May) to 2.8 million barrels a day (in June),'' the report
stated.
   Iraq, like Iran, pumped about 2.8 million barrels a day, compared
with a quota of 2.64 million barrels.
   Kuwait produced an estimated 1.6 million barrels a day and the
United Arab Emirates 1.7 million barrels, compared with their
targets of about 1 million barrels a day.
   Nigeria produced an estimated 1.6 million barrels a day;
Venezuela, 1.7 million barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Indonesia,
1.2 million barrels; Algeria, 700,000 barrels; Gabon, 200,000
barrels, and Libya, 1 million barrels.

<HEAD>Cablevision Said To Be Considering Time Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cablevision Systems Corp. has been mentioned as
another possible bidder for Time Inc., further complicating the
media giant's plan to merge with Warner Communications Inc.
   Time attorney Lawrence Hamermesh told Delaware Chancery Court
Judge William Allen in a letter dated July 3 that ``Cablevision is
actively considering a bid for Time.'' The letter was disclosed
Wednesday.
   A Cablevision spokesman, David Carey, said the cable-TV company
had no comment on the letter. Time spokesman Edward Adler said his
company _ which is trying to fend off a $12.2 billion hostile bid
from Paramount Communications Corp. _ also would not comment.
   The letter was filed with the Delaware court, which is
considering suits brought against Time by Paramount and a group of
Time shareholders that includes Cablevision and Texas investor
Robert Bass.
   The Time board has rejected Paramount's $200-a-share bid as
inadquate and too dependent upon contingencies to be viable. The
company is trying to preserve its planned merger with Warner and has
launched a $14 billion tender offer for that movie and publishing
concern.
   Paramount sued Time in Delaware to force Time's board of
directors to consider its offer.
   Time stock rose $1.25 a share to $155.25 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Wednesday. Warner was up 87{ cents to
$61.25 a share and Paramount slipped 87{ cents to $59.37{ a share,
also in NYSE trading.
   Cablevision, which is based in Woodbury, N.Y., was off 87{ cents
to $41.75 a share on the American Stock Exchange.
   Some analysts who have followed the three-way struggle for Time
were skeptical about a bid from Cablevision, one of the nation's
largest operators of cable-TV systems and a provider of cable
programming.
   Fred Anschel, of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., noted that
Cablevision already has a heavy debt burden and likely could not
handle the high leverage needed to complete a buyout of Time.
   But Frederick Moran, an analyst who follows Cablevision for Moran
&amp; Associates Inc., said, ``If they do it, I would expect them to be
a very tough player.''
   Moran acknowledged that Cablevision's debt load was a concern,
but said the company likely would have a partner if it does make a
bid. ``That makes the situation doable,'' he said.
   It was not immediately known whether Bass was considering joining
Cablevision in a possible bid. David Bonderman, a Bass spokesman,
did not return a telephone call seeking comment and Bonderman's
secretary said it was the company's policy not to comment on
possible bids.
   However, Anschel said, any new bids for Time would be academic
before the Delaware court ruled on the Paramount suit.
   Paramount is seeking to force the Time board to seriously
consider its offer on grounds that the board effectively put the
company up for sale when it agreed to merge with Warner in a
stock-swap earlier this year.
   Under Delaware law, if a company has put itself up for sale, it
must consider whatever bids will give shareholders the maximum
value. If the court rules in Paramount's favor, Time will be
hard-pressed to ignore Paramount's bid, which is $74 higher than the
price at which Time stock traded before Paramount announced its
original $10.7 billion, or $175 a share, bid June 6.
   Allen, the Delaware judge, will hear arguments in the case
Tuesday and is expected to rule shortly afterward. However, any
decision undoubtedly will be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Paramount extended the expiration date of
its offer for Time until July 28. The offer had been scheduled to
expire Friday.

<HEAD>Inspection of 727s Ordered After Discovery of Unusual Crack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered
rigorous inspections of the 47 oldest Boeing 727s following the
discovery of an unusual 20-inch crack on a United Airlines jet,
officials said Wednesday.
   United inspectors found the crack June 26 during a routine
maintenance inspection and notified Boeing Co. and the FAA
immediately, said United spokesman Rob Doughty in a telephone
interview from Chicago.
   The crack started inside the plane and broke through the surface.
The trijet has been repaired and is back in service, officials said.
   The cracked portion was removed for examination by Boeing
specialists. Preliminary indications suggested the cause was metal
fatigue, FAA officials said.
   The 727, no longer manufactured, was the all-time best-selling
commercial jet before being supplanted by the Boeing 737. Boeing
spokesman Tom Cole said there are 1,765 of the 727s in service.
   Structural problems in older aircraft usually can be anticipated,
often through computers, but the one in the United jet ``was found
in an unexpected place,'' Cole said.
   The FAA order requires the removal of some of the seats and
removal of sidewall linings and insulation to gain access to the
inside of the fuselage skin, Cole said.
   Without corrective measures, cracks in the fuselage skin could
result in rapid decompression of the airplane in flight, officials
said.
   The FAA issued an airworthiness directive Friday for internal
inspection of the fuselage skin lap joints and for repair of cracks
as needed by July 15 for the 47 oldest Boeing 727s, with findings to
be reported back to the agency.
   The directive was distributed by telegram, a method used in cases
considered urgent.
   ``The crack is a serious discovery, and we responded to it in a
serious way,'' Steven B. Wallace, acting manager of the FAA's
Transport Airplane Directorate, told KIRO Television.
   Inspections were ordered only for the 47 oldest 727s because the
skin was made thicker on later models, Cole said. He added that he
did not know which airlines or whether any foreign carriers were
affected.
   Most of the first 47 Boeing 727s were delivered to U.S. carriers
in 1963 and 1964, but many later were sold to other airlines, Cole
said.

   As the 1989 automotive model year begins its last
three months, analysts are wondering what manufacturers will do to
get rid of inventories before the next model year gets under way in
October.
   ``It's obvious that incentives aren't working,'' analyst Kathleen
Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. of New York said
Wednesday after automakers reported a 20 percent decline in vehicle
sales last month compared with June 1988.
   But the comparison was colored by strong sales last June that
helped 1988 become the second-best year in automotive history.
   ``Because June of 1988 was such an exceptionally strong sales
month, unfavorable year-to-year comparisons were anticipated,'' said
Ford Motor Co. sales Vice President Robert Rewey. ``We continue to
be encouraged by the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.
Consumer confidence remains strong, buoyed by record employment
levels and moderating inflation.''
   Ford led the way in late March with a new incentive package that
featured financing as low as 2.9 percent. General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler Corp. followed the move to new consumer enticements, and
since then the Big Three have expanded their programs.
   But it appears that the incentives, designed to spark car sales
this spring and summer, didn't do the trick.
   The average sales rate among the eight automakers with U.S.
plants for the June 21-30 period this year was 26,811 vehicles a
day, down from a daily rate of 33,495 during the same time last year.
   Among the Big Three, Chrysler's car sales were off 28.6 percent,
GM's were down 23.4 percent and Ford's declined 22.5 percent.
   For the month, with imported automakers' figures included, car
and truck sales were down 11.4 percent, going to a daily rate of
49,635 vehicles from a rate of 56,032 during June of last year.
   For the first half of 1989, sales of all domestic vehicles were
off 6.8 percent, with car sales falling 7.6 percent and truck sales
declining 5.3 percent.
   For months, analysts have predicted a downturn in sales. However,
automakers, with some adjustments, have kept up production, meaning
inventories have remained above usual levels.
   ``It's too late in the year for them to do anything other than to
say, `Gee, the market is very weak and we have to get the cars out
the door,''' said analyst Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America
in San Francisco. ``I think they are at a loss at what to do there.
There can only be more financing deals, more rebates or giveaway
option packages.''
   Heaney agreed, adding that the next few months, as the model year
begins to draw to a close, will be worth watching.
   ``I want to see what they are going to do, what type of
incentives are they going to use to clear out these '89 models'' she
said.
   Added Garretty: ``Although consumer confidence is holding up, the
message is clearly being sent that the economy is slowing down. And
that's got to be on people's minds a bit.
   ``Something that is not showing up in the numbers directly is
that holders of adjustable-rate mortgages have seen a major increase
in their payments ... and that has eaten at their pocketbook.
   ``When it comes between the house and the car, the house is going
to win out.''

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for third period of June 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were nine selling days in the period this year and nine selling days
last year.
   For the month, there were 26 selling days this year and 26
selling days last year, and so far in 1989, 153 selling days,
compared with 154 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Because of the Independence Day
holiday, some low-volume imported car and truck makers said they
would report sales Thursday.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Pensions for Retirees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retirees of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.
will continue to receive payment of supplemental pension benefits
under a federal court ruling.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Simmons on Wednesday approved a request
to extend the payments, which expired last month for 965 retirees.
   The request was supported by the United Steelworkers, the company
and its major bankruptcy creditors. It was opposed by Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp.
   At issue were monthly payments for 965 retirees and beneficiaries
that have been paid for about 2{ years under an agreement between
the company and the PBGC, the federally established insurer of
private pension plans.
   Simmons agreed with union and company contentions that the
elimination of the supplemental payments would cause ``severe and
irreparable'' harm to retirees. Those payments average about $230 a
month, said company spokesman Ray Johnson.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh and the union argued that not paying the
benefits would damage labor relations at the company during a
critical point in its bankruptcy reorganization efforts.
   The pension issues and the labor issues are the last big hurdles
to the steel company's emergence from Chapter 11 protection of the
bankruptcy court, said Peter Shinevar, an attorney for the union.

<HEAD>Japanese Investment Down in Hawaii</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investment in Hawaii real estate in the
first six months of the year was down about 20 percent from the same
period last year, according to a study by a Honolulu newspaper.
   The Honolulu Advertiser reported Wednesday that Japanese
investors bought or announced purchases of at least $809 million
worth of Hawaii real estate during the first six months of 1989.
That was down from more than $1 billion in property bought by
Japanese investors in the same period last year.
   Real estate experts and local economists have said foreign
investment in the state was bound to decline, considering the huge
amount of money that has already been poured in here, and because
the Japanese are being lured by perhaps more lucrative investments
elsewhere.
   Since 1986, Japanese investors spent more than $4.4 billion on
Hawaii real estate, buying mostly luxury hotels, golf courses,
office buildings, shopping centers and residential homes.
   The 1989 six-month figures showed most investment in that period
went toward buying hotels and resorts, the Advertiser said.
   The sales of two Maui resorts accounted for nearly half the total
investment in that period. The Wailea resort was sold for nearly
$200 million, while the newly-opened Embassy Suites resorts at
Kaanapali fetched $151.2 million.
   However, the Advertiser study indicated that more Japanese
investors were acquiring raw land for development, rather than
buying existing assets.
   Thousands of acres of land have been purchased on the islands of
Hawaii, Maui and Molokai, it said.

<HEAD>Spalding Wins Golf Ball Suit Against Acushnet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spalding Sports Worldwide has won a golf ball
patent lawsuit against rival Acushnet Co. that could have
industrywide ramifications.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward Harrington ruled that Acushnet
and its Titleist division infringed on Spalding's patent for a
Surlyn blend used in the company's top selling ball, Top Flite.
   The ruling Wednesday could affect the rest of the golf ball
industry because Spalding's attorney, George McAndrews, said that
the company intends to move ahead with patent lawsuits against
virtually all the golf ball makers in the country.
   Spalding filed the lawsuit against Acushnet in 1981. The two
companies control about 80 percent of the golf ball market, with
Spalding the leader.
   McAndrews refused to tell the Boston Herald the amount of damages
Spalding would seek from Acushnet, but he did say that it would be
``a significant portion'' of Acushnet's profits on balls that
infringed on Spalding patents.
   ``They had hundreds of millions of dollars in sales on those
balls,'' he said. ``We'll now try to determine what portion of that
was profit.''
   A spokesman for Acushnet said the decision would not affect the
company's day-to-day operations.
   ``We're disputing the decision, and we'll appeal it,'' said Wally
Uihlein, president and chief executive officer of Acushnet's
Titleist division.
   Uihlein told the newspaper that the company stopped using the
Surlyn blend four years ago.
   ``This decision has no effect on our day-to-day operations,'' he
said. ``We converted our balls in 1985, and converted again
recently. We maintain a pretty healthy balance sheet.''
   Spalding has six similar infringement suits pending against six
other golf ball companies: McGregor, Wilson, Hogan, McLaughlin &amp;
Son, Cayman and Exim, the Herald said. Those suits were reportedly
on hold pending the outcome of the Acushnet suit.

<HEAD>Canadian Family Interested in Buying Armstrong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armstrong World Industries Inc. says it is
going to court to head off a Canadian family that has expressed an
interest in acquiring the interior furnishing company.
   Armstrong said Wednesday it was informed that the Belzberg family
of Vancouver, British Columbia, recently bought 9.85 percent of the
company's outstanding stock for $181 million through two affiliates.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission July 3,
the Belzbergs said they are considering making a proposal to acquire
the Lancaster, Pa.-based Armstrong, which had 1988 profits of $162.7
million on sales of $2.68 billion.
   Armstrong stock closed up $4.37{ at $47.87{ in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Wednesday. It was the most actively
traded issue Wednesday, with 1,723,100 shares changing hands.
   Armstrong said Wednesday it was filing suit against the Belzbergs
in U.S. District Court seeking a judgment affirming the
constitutionality of the state's anti-takeover laws and the validity
of Armstrong's shareholders' rights plan.
   One of the Belzberg companies involved in the stock purchase said
in the SEC filing that it would file suit challenging the state's
anti-takeover laws and seeking to prevent Armstrong from
implementing its employee stock ownership plan.
   The ESOP, unveiled June 20, would put 12 percent of the company's
voting stock in employees' hands.
   Belzberg spokesman John Bowles declined to specify the Belzbergs'
next move. But he said they would seek regulatory clearance to
acquire 50 percent or more of Armstrong common stock.
   William W. Adams, Armstrong chairman and president, said in a
statement Wednesday that the company is not interested in selling
and has refused to meet with Belzberg representatives.
   ``We have no interest in meeting with the Belzbergs,'' Adams
said. ``The Belzberg family's interest in Armstrong has been
discussed with our board several times.
   ``Based on a review of, among other things, the Belzbergs' past
record and experiences to date, the board concluded that no
interests of any of the many groups closely associated with
Armstrong would be served by meeting with them.''
   In the SEC filing, the Belzbergs said that if they acquired
Armstrong, they intended to keep the company's floor coverings and
building products segments, while selling others, including the
furniture and industry products segments.
   The floor coverings and building products segments accounted for
a majority of the company's operating profit in 1988.
   The Belzbergs, through their affiliate companies, frequently have
invested in publicly held companies. Their flagship company is First
City Financial Corp. of Vancouver, an investment and holding company
which is 72 percent owned by the Belzbergs.
   The Belzberg family is headed by three brothers _ Hyman, 63,
Samuel, 61, and William, 56. The family originally was in the
furniture retail business. Today, Hyman Belzberg heads that activity
and Samuel is chief executive of First City. William is president of
Far West Savings &amp; Loan Association, Newport Beach, Calif.
   Its other main interests are real estate and investments in other
companies.

<HEAD>Sikorsky Plans to Lay Off 350</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikorsky Aircraft, whose helicopter
program is expected to be hurt by Pentagon budget cuts, plans to lay
off 350 salaried workers effective July 15.
   The announcement was made in the July 3 issue of Sikorsky Weekly,
a company publication.
   The employees to be laid off represent about 6 percent of the
company's 5,900-person white-collar workforce. They will be notified
Wednesday.
   The decision to cut the workforce comes a month after Sikorsky
managers were asked to identify 10 percent of the jobs in their
departments that could be cut this summer.
   In Sikorsky Weekly, vice president John Carpino said the layoffs
are part of an effort to remain competitive in the face of shrinking
defense budgets around the world.
   Three of Sikorsky's big helicopter programs _ the Black Hawk,
Super Stallion and the CV-Helo _ are expected to be hurt by the
Pentagon budget cuts for fiscal year 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   Carpino indicated that those dismissed will include part-time
workers and full-time administrative staffers.
   The article did not say how many employees would be laid off at
Sikorsky's five plants throughout Connecticut. Those plants employ
12,000 of the company's 13,000 employees. The company has smaller
plants in Florida and Alabama.
   Carpino stated that a severance package has been prepared.
   Merit raises for salaried employees, withheld last month in a
cost-cutting move, will be delayed until Sept. 16.
   ``We'll continue to review our employee posture to make sure we
maintain the competitive edge that we have,'' said Sikorsky
spokesman Jim Bowman. ``And that doesn't preclude further action.''

<TEXT>
   Alan G. Hassenfeld, president of Hasbro
Inc., was named Thursday to succeed his late brother as chairman and
chief executive officer of the toy manufacturer.
   Hassenfeld, 40, had been second in command at Hasbro since 1984
and his elevation to the chairmanship was widely expected. He will
remain president, the company said.
   In a brief statement after his election, Hassenfeld promised to
continue the course set by his brother, Stephen, who died on June 25
at age 47.
   ``We have a strong management team, a diverse product line and a
deep commitment to the future,'' Hassenfeld said.
   During his reign at Hasbro, Stephen Hassenfeld was praised for
building the Pawtucket-based company into the world's biggest
toymaker largely on the strength of basic, perennially popular toys
like Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls, G.I. Joe and the Playskool line of
products for infants and toddlers.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected a
staff recommendation that protective containment shells on 24
commercial nuclear power reactors be modified to lessen the risk of
rupture in the event of a severe accident.
   The commission said there was no need for a blanket requirement
for the changes, although it ordered a plant-by-plant study of
whether hard pipe vents should be added to the containment
buildings, known as Mark I and made by General Electric Co.
   The vents would relieve severe pressure that would build up if
the reactor core were damaged. A containment failure could lead to
the release of dangerous amounts of radioactivity into the
atmosphere.
   Anti-nuclear groups have urged the NRC to shut down plants with
Mark I containment buildings, saying they pose too great a risk to
public health and safety.
   The NRC staff earlier this year recommended requiring the changes
at all 24 plants _ about a quarter of the nation's nuclear power
stations.
   The commission rejected that approach Wednesday, but said it
would require the hard pipe vents at any plant deemed by NRC
analysts to need them. It said the case-by-case approach should
settle the question for all 24 plants within three years.
   The 24 plants were selected because their containment buildings
are believed to be more vulnerable to rupture during a severe
reactor accident than other containment systems.
   The commission also said it would approve vents at any plants
that voluntarily chose to install them. Few are expected to do it
voluntarily, although Boston Edison Co.'s Pilgrim plant has done so.
   As a further precaution, the commission ordered its staff to
speed up implementation of an existing NRC requirement that a Mark I
plant be capable of withstanding a total loss of electrical power
without overheating the reactor.
   Kenneth Boley, a nuclear expert for the Public Citizen
environmental group, said the NRC was ``buying time'' for the
nuclear industry by promising further study.
   Robert Pollard, a nuclear engineer with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, today called the decision ``a big punt'' that ``creates
the impression for the public that the NRC has done something when
they've actually done nothing.''
   Plant owners generally opposed a blanket requirement for
improvements to the Mark I containment system, saying they would not
appreciably reduce the risk of rupture.
   Of the 24 reactors with Mark I containments, five are not
operating. They are Philadelphia Electric Co.'s Peach Bottom No. 3,
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s Nine Mile Point No. 1, and the
Tennessee Valley Authority's Browns Ferry No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3.
   The remaining plants in the study, their location and owners are:
   Brunswick, two reactors at Southport, N.C., Carolina Power &amp;
Light Co.; Cooper, Brownsville, Neb., Nebraska Public Power
District; Dresden, two reactors at Morris, Ill., Commonwealth Edison
Co.; Quad Cities, two reactors at Cordova, Ill., Commonwealth Edison
and Iowa Gas &amp; Electric Co.;
   Duane Arnold, Palo, Iowa, Iowa Electric Light &amp; Power Co.; Fermi
2, Laguna Beach, Mich., Detroit Edison Co.; James A. Fitzpatick,

at Baxley, Ga., Georgia Power Co.;
   Hope Creek, Salem, N.J., Public Service Electric & Gas Co.;

   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading

   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.71 million shares as of 10

   The Labor Department is due to issue statistics Friday on the

   Analysts expect the figures to show growth at the rate of about

   Here is a chronology of key events involving
former Los Angeles stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, who is to be
sentenced today for his role in Wall Street's insider trading
scandal:
   Nov. 14, 1986 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay $100
million to settle charges of trading on insider information. He also
agrees to cooperate with investigators and to plead guilty to a
single unspecified criminal charge.
   March 19, 1987 _ Boyd L. Jefferies, founder of the Los Angeles
securities firm Jefferies &amp; Co., agrees to plead guilty to two
criminal charges involving securities law violations, including one
deal involving Boesky. He is not accused of insider trading.
Jefferies, who was implicated by Boesky, resigns as chairman of
Jefferies &amp; Co. and agrees to stay out of the securities business
for at least five years.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term, and no
fine.
   July 6 _ Using information supplied by Jefferies, a Manhattan
federal grand jury indicts GAF Corp., vice chairman James Sherwin
and two subsidiaries on charges they manipulated the price of Union
Carbide Corp. stock in 1986 after a failed attempt to acquire the
company.
   Nov. 3, 1988 _ A grand jury indicts Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis, a
well-known takeover speculator, on charges he manipulated the stock
price of Fireman's Fund Corp. in 1986 to help American Express Co.
sell part of its Fireman's Fund stake for more money. The indictment
is based partly on disclosures by Boyd Jefferies more than a year
earlier.
   Dec. 22 _ Corporate raider and Singer Co. Chairman Paul A.
Bilzerian is indicted by a grand jury on 12 felony counts linked to
four unsuccessful takeover deals in 1985 and 1986. Charges include
securities and tax fraud, conspiracy and making false disclosure
statements. Jefferies supplied some of the material used in the
indictment.
   Jan. 3, 1989 _ Jefferies makes his courtroom debut, testifying
that GAF and Sherwin asked him to manipulate the price of Union
Carbide stock in the fall of 1986.
   Jan. 10 _ U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe declares a
mistrial in the GAF case, ruling that prosecutors withheld, albeit
unintentionally, a key document.
   Feb. 6 _ Jefferies takes the stand in the GAF retrial, repeating
his allegations against GAF.
   Feb. 8 _ Defense lawyers attack Jefferies' credibility, labeling
him a ``crook'' who had done a ``dirty deal'' with Boesky.
   Feb. 27 _ Jefferies &amp; Co. head trader James Melton contradicts
testimony by his former boss. Melton said he didn't recall a request
by Sherwin to manipulate Union Carbide stock, as Jefferies testified.
   March 22 _ After 12 days of deliberations, the GAF jury reports
it is hopelessly deadlocked and Judge Lowe declares a second
mistrial. Jurors later say they didn't believe Jefferies' testimony.
   May 10 _ Jefferies testifies that he purchased and held blocks of
stock for Bilzerian in four companies in 1985 and 1986. A Jefferies
&amp; Co. executive later corroborated his testimony.
   June 9 _ Bilzerian is convicted.
   June 29 _ Jefferies, his lawyer and government prosecutors meet
with U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker to discuss his sentencing.
Prosecutors praise his cooperation and Jefferies lawyer requests
probation and no jail term. Lasker indicates some prison time is
likely.
   July 6 _ Jefferies is sentenced to five years probation _ meaning
he will serve no jail time _ and fined $250,000 for his guilty pleas.

   The Canadian government will sell all its shares in
Air Canada for $12 each, John McDermid, minister of privatization,
announced Wednesday.
   The government plans to release a prospectus outlining the sale
of 41.1 million shares of the state-owned airline, or about 57
percent of the outstanding shares.
   The government began its sale of Air Canada last October when it
sold 30.8 million shares, or about 43 percent of the company, for $8
a share.
   The sale will raise about $490 million, which is expected to go
to the government rather than the airline. The $240 million in
proceeds from the October sale went to paying Air Canada's debt.
   ``There was a six-month period in which no sales were allowed of
the government shares,'' McDermid said. ``We've passed that now and
the market conditions and the circumstances of Air Canada now permit
the balance of shares to be sold.''
   The lead underwriter in the share issue, RBC Dominion Securities,
recommended to the government Wednesday what the share price should
be and how many shares should be sold.
   McDermid said in an interview the $12-a-share offering price
represents a good return to the government, although he had hinted
in May that the price could be as high as $16.
   Air Canada stock had been trading on the Montreal and Toronto
exchanges at around $13 a share but closed Wednesday _ before
McDermid's announcement _ at $12.25.
   The price began to rise shortly after the stock was issued in
October, but it soared in January after PWA Corp. announced it was
buying Wardair. That meant the number of Canadian airline companies
dropped from three to two and the reduced competition made Air
Canada a darling of the financial community.
   ``The carrier can operate in the private sector much better than
in the public sector,'' McDermid said. ``It will be allowed to
compete on an open and free basis rather than having government
dictate to it.''
   McDermid said all shares have been committed to be purchased from
the government by underwriters, who in turn sell them to investors.
He said 33 million shares will be issued in Canada and 8 million to
foreigners.
   October's sale was restricted to Canadians, but foreign investors
soon began to buy them from Canadians willing to sell. Foreign
investors are now edging toward the 25 percent ceiling on foreign
ownership of a Canadian airline.
   McDermid did not say when the sale will take place. October's
sale occurred 2{ weeks after the prospectus was issued.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
active early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as the
markets cooled a bit following a powerful rally in the previous
session.
   Wheat and oat futures were a little lower while corn and soybeans
were mixed.
   Corn and soybean futures advanced by their permitted daily limits
Wednesday, largely in reaction to forecasts for hot, dry weather in
the Midwest through the middle of next week.
   A new National Weather Service six-to-10-day outlook issued late
Wednesday predicted above-average temperatures in the region for all
of next week, but it also suggested the Corn Belt could see more
rain than traders had expected, and that was a moderating influence
in the early going.
   Extreme heat and dryness pose the greatest threat to the corn
crop, which is in the weather-sensitive pollination stage.
   Prospects for spotty showers and cooler temperatures in spring
wheat regions at the end of this week prompted some selling of wheat
futures.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.02{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
lower to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.82 a bushel; oats were 1\
cents to 3 cents lower with July at $1.65 a bushel; soybeans were 4{
cents lower to 3{ cents higher with July at $7.72 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent lower to .08 cent higher with August at
70.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .58 cent higher
with August at 80.82 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .45
cent lower with July at 46.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .25 cent to 1.75 cents lower with July at 30.90 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday while pork futures were
sharply lower.

   The stock market made little progress today as
traders awaited Friday's scheduled report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .76 to 2,457.32
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 716 up, 546 down and
554 unchanged.
   The Labor Department is due to issue statistics Friday on the
employment situation for June.
   Analysts expect the figures to show growth at the rate of about
250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, more than double the 101,000
preliminary increase reported for May.
   But they also maintain that the June figure will be inflated by a
quirk in the timing of surveys on which the data are based.
   Thus, some argue, the latest evidence may not deter the Federal
Reserve from relaxing its credit policy to cushion the impact of a
slowdown in business activity.
   Armstrong World Industries rose 1[ to 49 in active trading on top

   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse
announced today they had initiated formal talks about a possible
merger of their worldwide operations, which if completed would
create the world's largest accounting firm.
   The two firms issued a news release confirming published reports
about the talks and that a confidentiality agreement will be in
effect for 60 days while a merger is explored.
   A joint statement by Joseph E. Connor, chairman of Price
Waterhouse World Firm, and Lawrence E. Weinbach, chief executive of
Arthur Andersen, said the the globalization of world economies,
acclerating technological changes and demand for new services and
investments had created the need for increased worldwide
professional and financial resources that would enable the firms to
serve their clients.
   Rumors have circulated for weeks that Chicago-based Arthur
Andersen and New York's Price Waterhouse, two of the industry's Big
Eight companies, were looking for ways to combine.
   Two weeks ago, approval was won for the merger of Ernst &amp; Whinney
and Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting firms. The resulting company of
this merger is expected to have worldwide revenue of $4.2 billion
and domestic revenue of $2 billion.
   If Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse merge, they are expected
to take in $5 billion annually worldwide and $2.7 billion in the
United States.
   ``The environment is very conducive to this right now,'' said
James Emerson, publisher of the Big Eight Review, an industry
newsletter.
   There also have been rumors of a merger between Deloitte Haskins
&amp; Sells and Touche Ross &amp; Co., two more of the Big Eight.
   Arthur Andersen is currently the leading U.S. accounting firm and
the world's second biggest with international revenue last year of
$2.8 billion. It employs 45,000 people.
   Price Waterhouse is the fifth-largest in the nation and the
fourth worldwide, with international revenue of $2.2 billion. It has
a payroll of 39,000 people.

<HEAD>Major Retailers Report Mixed Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports from the nation's major retailers today showed uneven
June results, with sales at some big chains held back by weak
consumer spending while department stores benefited from a
continuing turnaround in women's apparel.
   Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said industrywide sales were mixed with poorer tallies coming from
non-clothing categories.
   Among the leading general merchandisers, K mart Corp., the
country's second largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co., said
its June sales represented an improvement after a string of
disappointing months.
   Fast-growing discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc., currently ranked
third, turned in another robust performance.
   Higher inflation and costlier instalment debt payments, due to
past interest rate increases, have pinched consumers. A spending
slowdown has shown up mainly in purchases of big-ticket items, like
cars and home appliances, while outlays for less expensive
merchandise haven't been affected as much.
   But Edelman said the moderation in consumer spending, the chief
fuel for overall economic activity, has more to do with the aging of
the business cycle.
   ``The consumer is still healthy, still confident, but I think a
lot of demand has been satisfied,'' said Edelman. ``I think the
consumer is just tired and needs to rest a little bit.''
   Industry analysts said general merchandise retailers' results in
June may have appeared a bit weaker than they actually were because
they were being compared with one of 1988's better months. By
contrast, results of apparel sellers may have looked better because
last year was an exceptionally dismal one for fashion merchandising.
   Analysts typically look to the results of Limited Inc. for signs
of how the women's apparel business is doing.
   Limited posted an 11 percent rise in sales to $387 million in the
five weeks ended July 1 from $347.5 a year earlier. Besides its
flagship women's clothing shops, Limited owns a number of other
stores such as Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch.
   Sales at Limited's stores open at least a year rose 12 percent in
June. Retailers and industry analysts say same-store, or comparable
store, sales give a more accurate reading of a company's performance
than totals that include sales at newly opened stores. Not every
retailer reports same-store sales.
   Last month's standouts included Dayton Hudson Corp., which said
June sales rose 14.2 percent to $1.20 billion from $1.05 billion in
June of 1988, and its same-store sales rose 6.1 percent. The
department store operator, which also runs Target's and Mervyn's
stores, reported strong gains in its apparel sales.
   J.C. Penney Co. also attributed its sales pickup to demand for
summer fashions plus increased purchases of soft home furnishings
like bedding and bath goods. Its June sales rose 7.6 percent to
$1.25 billion from $1.16 billion, and same-store sales increased 5.6
percent.
   Among the leading retailers reporting today were:
   Sears said its sales rose 2.9 percent to $3.2 billion in the five
weeks ended July 1 from $3.11 billion a year earlier. On a
comparable-store basis, Sears' sales increased 3.6 percent.
   K mart's sales rose 5.7 percent to $2.74 billion in the five
weeks ended June 28 from $2.60 billion in the corresponding 1988
period. Same-store sales went up 2.3 percent.
   Wal-Mart's sales grew 25 percent to $2.03 billion in June from
$1.63 billion a year before, and its same-store sales rose 10
percent.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its domestic sales increased 8.2 percent
in June to $439 million from the year ago's $405 million, and its
same-store sales were up 3.6 percent.
   The results reported today were from the biggest general
merchandise chains and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail
sales figures released by the federal government, they do not
include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

<HEAD>Two Canadian Agencies Approve Molson-Carling Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Canadian government agencies said Thursday they
will not challenge the merger of brewing giants Molson Companies
Ltd. and Carling O'Keefe Breweries of Canada Ltd.
   ``Under present market conditions the merger is not likely to
raise concerns under the Competition Act in any area of Canada other
than Alberta and Quebec,'' said Calvin Goldman, director of the
Bureau of Competition Policy. Investment Canada, the agency that
monitors and promotes foreign investment in Canada, also gave its
blessing to the merger. Carling O'Keefe is owned by Elders IXL Ltd.,
an Australian conglomerate.
   Goldman didn't attach any conditions to the deal but said the
bureau will monitor the brewing industry for three years,
particularly in the provinces of Alberta and Quebec. The new
company, to be called Molson Breweries, will have a total asset
value of 1.5 billion Canadian dollars, or about $1.26 billion.
   The merger, announced in late January, will create Canada's
largest brewing company and the sixth largest in North America once
the deal is completed.
   The new company will have annual sales of 2.3 billion Canadian
dollars, or around $1.93 billion, and a 52 percent share of the
Canadian beer market.
   The deal also calls for 1,400 jobs to be eliminated over three
years as seven of the companies' 16 breweries are closed. Both
Molson and Carling O'Keefe are based in Ontario.
   John Labatt Ltd., currently Canada's No. 1 brewer, had called on
Goldman to force the new merged company to give up some of its
brand-name beers.
   ``I will not hesitate to seek an appropriate remedial order if
necessary from the Competition Tribunal should it subsequently be
determined that the merger prevents or lessens competition
substantially,'' Goldman said in a statement.
   In announcing his decision, Goldman said the companies needed the
merger to streamline their operations to compete with lower-cost
U.S. brewing companies.
   Goldman said he has particular concern that Molson Breweries will
have more than 50 percent market share in both Alberta and Quebec.
   He said imported beer from the United States, smaller independent
breweries and the continuing strong presence of Labatt should help
maintain competition in those provinces.
   Goldman also said he is considering continuing talks to reduce
inter-provincial barriers to trade in beer, which could increase
competition.
   The only major competitor after the merger would be Labatt, which
now has a 42 percent market share.
   Molson and Elders said in a joint statement that they welcome the
decision to allow the merger to proceed.
   ``The partnership will produce a stronger Canadian-based brewer,
making it more efficient and thus positioning it to meet increased
international competition,'' the companies said.

   The government today ordered a ban on almost
all uses of asbestos, ending a decade-long debate over the health
risk posed by the cancer-causing substance in such items as brake
linings and water pipes.
   The regulatory action, which will end the manufacture of most
asbestos products in three phases over the next seven years, will
not affect asbestos products already in use. Officials said
replacing some of those products might be more hazardous than a
gradual phaseout.
   ``This is pollution prevention. We're eliminating a known
cancer-causing substance from the marketplace,'' declared EPA
Administrator William Reilly. He said despite government attempts to
curb asbestos emissions, the fibers continue to pose ``a significant
risk to current and future populations.''
   Reilly said the cost of getting asbestos out of most products
would be minimal because safer alternative products are available.
The EPA estimated the regulation would cost society $459 million
over 13 years.
   The regulatory action does not affect ongoing efforts to rid
buildings, including hundreds of schools, of asbestos insulation.
Reilly said such efforts should continue under careful control to
minimize exposure.
   Under the new ban, the EPA will allow asbestos to be a component
in only a small number of items such as guided missile liners,
acetylene cylinders, and some types of sealant tape and packaging.
   But the ban by 1997 will cover an estimated 94 percent by volume
of all asbestos used in a variety of products currently
manufactured, the agency said.
   Among those products are automobile brake pads and linings,
cement water distribution pipes, roofing shingles, floor and pipe
wrapping, asbestos millboard, gaskets and other construction
products.
   Because asbestos has been singled out as a cause of lung cancer,
its use has been restricted in recent years. Loosely formed asbestos
insulation for buildings and pipes no longer is used and asbestos
emissions into the air are regulated.
   School officials across the country have been directed to inspect
for asbestos and develop plans to eliminate it from school buildings.
   But asbestos continues to be used in various forms for a wide
variety of products. As recently as 1987 it was estimated that
85,000 tons of asbestos went into hundreds of products annually.
Three years earlier the estimates were 240,000 tons a year.
   Asbestos is part of the nation's water system with an estimated
400,000 miles of concrete-asbestos piping carrying drinking water to
thousands of communities. Most automobile and truck brake linings
and pads are made of asbestos because the product is strong and
relatively inexpensive.
   Its use has continued, although scientists have known for years
that asbestos fibers when inhaled can cause lung cancer and other
lung disorders that may not show up for decades.
   But while there is widespread agreement about the health risks
from loosely packed asbestos found in building insulation or from
high-levels of certain occupational exposure, the risks posed from
its other uses has been debated for nearly a decade.
   The government first considered a ban on asbestos use in 1979.
   But EPA attempts to propose a regulation covering a wide variety
of asbestos products were stymied in the Reagan administration
because of strong opposition from the Office of Management and
Budget. Finally in 1986 the EPA proposed a ban covering a variety of
asbestos products.
   The final EPA rule does not affect products already in use such
as asbestos brake pads in many cars and trucks now on the road or
the thousands of miles of cement-asbestos water distribution pipes
found in many parts of the country.
   However, the ban covers:
   _A variety of felt products for roofing, flooring and pipe wrap,
as well as construction sheet products beginning next year.
   _Automobile and small truck brake linings, disc brake pads,
clutches and automatic transmission components in all new cars
beginning in 1994.
   _Cement water distribution pipes, in used auto and truck
replacement parts and repairs, roof shingles and paper products
beginning in 1997.
   The expected regulatory action was praised by environmentalists
even in advance of its release.
   ``This is the first time since 1980 that the EPA has done a major
industry-wide ban on a particular toxic substance,'' said Jacqueline
Warren, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   She said the action represents a change in focus from trying to
control emissions of certain toxic substances to halting their use.
``This is a new approach _ pollution prevention,'' she said in an
interview.
   In 1980, the EPA directed a ban on PCBs at the insistence of
Congress.

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday that
U.S. sugar production should rebound sharply after last year's
drought.
   Total production in the 1989-90 crop year that will begin on
Sept. 1 is expected to be about 7.3 million tons, up 5.6 percent
from 1988-89 output estimated at 6.91 million tons.
   With improved growing conditions, sugar production in the coming
year could match or exceed the record level of 7.33 million tons in
1987-88, the department's Economic Research Service said.
   Beet sugar production, forecast at 3.9 million tons, would be up
11 percent from the drought-reduced level of 3.51 million tons this
season, the report said. Cane sugar, which rose to a record of just
under 3.4 million tons in 1988-89, is forecast at about the same in
1989-90.

   Nestle's Carnation Co. has agreed to pay
$90,000 to nine states to settle allegations it used misleading and
deceptive advertising to promote a new infant formula, Attorney
General Don Hanaway said Thursday.
   Under the settlement, Carnation will pay each state $10,000 and
halt advertising claims that its Good Start H.A. baby fomula is
hypoallergenic, Hanaway said.
   The states include Wisconsin, California, Illinois, Iowa,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New York and Texas.
   Tim F. Crull, president and chief executive officer of Carnation
Co., said the claims by the attorneys general were not supported by
the facts, but that Carnation agreed to the settlement to avoid a
costly, lengthy court case.
   ``We first used the term `hypoallergenic' to accurately and
concisely describe Good Start H.A. and its attributes,'' Crull said
in a statement. ``As soon as we became aware, however, that there
was a potential for confusion over the meaning of hypoallergenicity,
Carnation promptly and voluntarily removed the term from the Good
Start H.A. label'' and other references to the product.
   Hanaway said an investigation by the attorneys general found
Carnation claimed the formula could not cause an allergic reaction
in infants who had problems with other formulas or a milk allergy.
   Hanaway said the attorneys general became aware of medical
reports on a number of infants who suffered allergic reactions,
including shock, from using Good Start.
   The settlement prohibits Carnation from using the word
``hypoallergenic'' in promoting the product and claiming it cannot
cause allergic reactions.

   Boyd L. Jefferies, who admitted to an illegal
stock scheme with inside trader Ivan Boesky, was spared a jail term
Thursday by a federal judge who praised his cooperation but called
Wall Street greed ``absurd and probably obscene.''
   U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker sentenced Jefferies to five
years probation and fined him $250,000. Jefferies, who pleaded
guilty to two felonies, provided information and testimony in the
government's continuing securities fraud investigations in exchange
for leniency.
   Jefferies, 58, had faced a maximum 10 years in jail and $500,000
fine.
   ``Mr. Jefferies has by now earned his way through agony and
effort to a suspended sentence,'' Lasker told a packed room at U.S.
District Court in Manhattan.
   But Lasker added a message he addressed to the financial
community.
   ``It is absurb and probably obscene for any person so engaged to
undertake acts which will possibly bring him greater riches,'' he
said. ``This country is beginning to awake I hope, however, to the
morally corrupting effect of thinking of oneself only.''
   Jefferies was fined $125,000 on each of two counts for helping
Boesky conceal the true ownership of $56 million in stock in 1985
and scheming with speculator Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis to manipulate
the stock price of Fireman's Fund Corp. in 1986
   ``I want to apologize to the court, to apologize to the
government, to apologize to my friends and family who have given me
so much support,'' Jefferies told the court, his voice cracking.
   In his 1987 plea deal, Jefferies also resigned from the Los
Angeles brokerage he founded in 1962 and was banished from the
securities business for at least five years. The soonest he can
reapply for a securities license is July 1992.
   While stating he believed Jefferies was aware he was breaking the
law, Lasker noted that Jefferies was not charged with trading on
inside information and did not personally profit from the deals.
   He said he also received letters ``which have really hit my heart
and made me feel there is no question that you are a good man.''
   Jefferies has provided the government with information leading to
three indictments and one conviction. He testified earlier this year
that he helped GAF Corp. manipulate the price of Union Carbide Corp.
stock, although that case twice ended in a mistrial.
   He also told a jury he illegally held stock for Florida investor
Paul A. Bilzerian, who was convicted last month in the first trial
success of the government's three-year securities fraud crackdown.
   Jefferies is to testify at the third GAF trial and the trial of
Lewis, both scheduled to begin in the fall.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano praised Jefferies' cooperation with
the government, including his testimony, 37 meetings with
prosecutors, repeated trips across country and identification of
documents.
   ``Mr. Jefferies' cooperation has made a significant contribution
to the government's effort to expose, punish and deter conduct which
we believe Mr. Jefferies acknowledges undermines the integrity of
the securities markets,'' Romano said.
   He added Jefferies' efforts deserved ``substantial appropriate
credit.'' The government did not issue a presentencing
recommendation.
   Lasker had sentenced Boesky _ who implicated Jefferies _ to three
years in prison in 1987. Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count
and paid $100 million to settle insider trading charges with the
government.
   Experts said Jefferies' suspended sentence would be regarded as a
slap on the wrist on Wall Street. Based on the Boesky sentence,
defense lawyers and legal scholars had expected Jefferies to receive
less, but some, jail time.
   ``I think it will send a message that if you are willing to pay
the price in dollars and incriminating other people you can go back
home,'' said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern
Methodist University.
   After sentencing, Jefferies, tanned and smoking a cigarette, told
reporters he had been prepared for some jail time.
   ``I was expecting much worse,'' he said. ``I think Judge Lasker
weighed the negatives and all the positives and I think I've really
done a lot for the industry.''
   Jefferies established his Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co.
brokerage firm 25 years ago and worked 16-hour days making
multimillion-share transactions for some of Wall Street's most
important He said he would like to return to the brokerage business
when he is permitted.
   Jefferies is now living in Aspen, Colo., where he runs a golf
clinic for underprivileged children. He also works with two other
youth programs, one of which was formed after his only son died in a
car crash.

   Coffee drinkers could be the winners of a
possible marketing war among roasters following this week's
suspension of coffee bean export quotas, analysts say.
   The International Coffee Organization's decision to suspend
quotas will enable smaller coffee producing countries severely
restricted under the quota system to export high-quality coffee
beans to willing U.S. customers, observers say.
   It also could mean lower retail prices by year's end.
   ``The agreement had put the American roaster into a strait
jacket,'' said Bert Ruiz, a vice president with the New York
brokerage firm Balfour Maclaine Corp. ``They were restricted in the
types of coffee they could buy because under the agreement...
   ``Now roasters are going to go into a very strong marketing war
to buy the best coffees they can. For once in a very long time
product will determine price.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., maker of Folgers coffee, says it is one
customer that will take advantage of a more open system.
   ``The suspension of quotas does permit us wider access to a
variety of coffee beans from all the different producing nations,''
said company spokesman William Dobson.
   ``As a roaster our access to those beans were limited to the
quotas so if we saw a trend to a particular type of coffee taste we
might not be able to get a supply of beans to meet the preference.
Now without the quotas that will change.''
   Chock Full O'Nuts Corp. spokesman Joseph Breslin says quality
coffee had been going to countries that were not part of the
international agreement while member nations were losing out. The
quotas restricted exports only among ICO nations.
   ``There has been a lack of quality coffee in the United States.
We had not been getting access to quality coffee because producing
nations were going to communist countries and selling it to them,''
Breslin said.
   ``Now there probably will be more quality coffee available to the
rest of the United States than there has been in the last several
years.''
   Coffee drinkers also may be in for dramatically lower retail
prices. Analysts predicted Wednesday that supermarket prices could
decline by more than 40 cents a pound by the end of the year.
   Some of the price cuts may come as special discounts on
particular brands and higher cents-off manufacturers coupons.
   ``We could see prices translating from wholesale to retail in one
to two months, sooner than usual,'' said Kim Badenhop, an analyst
with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ``Unless the middlemen are
going to fatten their profit along the way, wholesalers should be
able to pass along cuts of 40 to 45 cents.''
   The ICO announced Monday it would suspend export ceilings after
member nations rejected proposals to extend the existing coffee
pact. The decision by the 74-nation organization of coffee consumer-
and producer-nations took effect at midnight Tuesday.
   The decision essentially eliminates artificial supply conditions
imposed by the ICO to keep producer prices at $1.20 to $1.40 per
pound and creates a more open market. The coffee group, established
in 1963, has attempted to stabilize world coffee prices by limiting
the sale of green, or unroasted, coffee beans by producers.
   Retail coffee prices had climbed an average of 43 cents a pound,
or about 16 percent, from May 1988 to May 1989 _ or from $2.73 cents
per pound of ground roast to $3.16 a pound, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
   Procter &amp; Gamble's Dobson said that while prices might decline,
the cuts may not match the recent drop in wholesale prices, which
tumbled more than 40 cents in June.
   ``We would expect if things stabilize, to see the price of some
raw coffees declining, but we wouldn't necessarily see a direct
pass-through (from producers to consumers) because of depressed
profit margins over the years,'' said spokesman William Dobson.
   Cliff Sessions, a spokesman for General Foods, which makes
Maxwell House and Sanka coffees, said ``We do not expect an
immediate change in prices.'' Sessions said the company still had to
move a substantial amount of inventory purchased at higher prices.
   Breslin said quota suspension could benefit more than just the
consumer.
   ``If (wholesale) prices remain low enough, retail coffee prices
will go down. If they stay down then consumption will go up,'' he
said.

   The stock market struggled ahead today as traders
awaited Friday's scheduled report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.14 to 2,457.70
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 845 up, 551 down and
531 unchanged.
   The Labor Department is due to issue statistics Friday on the
employment situation for June.
   Analysts expect the figures to show growth at the rate of about
250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, more than double the 101,000
preliminary increase reported for May.
   But they also maintain that the June figure will be inflated by a
quirk in the timing of surveys on which the data are based.
   Thus, some argue, the latest evidence may not deter the Federal
Reserve from relaxing its credit policy to cushion the impact of a
slowdown in business activity.
   Armstrong World Industries rose 1] to 49\ in active trading on
top of a 4]-point jump Wednesday, when the company said the Belzberg

<TEXT>
   Real estate magnate Donald J. Trump, who usually
enjoys seeing his name on things, is in a legal battle with a small
Georgia company over ``Trump Cards,'' snazzy business cards the
billionaire says infringe on his name.
   Positive Concepts Ltd., the Lithia Springs company that makes the
cards, contends it got the name from the term used for a suit in a
card game that ranks above all others. The company's lawyers say the
case has escalated into a battle over the limits of money and power.
   ``Donald Trump simply wants to own the word `trump,' and anybody
who wants anything to do with it will have to face Donald Trump,''
said Atlanta attorney Kevin L. Ward. ``We can't give up a word in
the English language just because somebody has the power and money
to do so.''
   But Trump's attorneys say their client's name has become so well
known that consumers are going to be confused into thinking the
cards are backed by the businessman.
   Last month, Trump won a federal court order temporarily barring
Washington-based International Trading and Finance Corp. Ltd. from
using the name ``Trump Shuttle'' for a moving and storage subsidiary
in New York.
   Trump renamed Eastern Airlines' Washington-to-New York-to-Boston
air shuttle the ``Trump Shuttle'' after purchasing the service for
$365 million earlier this year.
   Attorneys now are compiling depositions for the business card
case, which ultimately will be considered by the federal Trademark
and Patent Board in Washington.
   At issue is PCL's line of business cards, which feature a
photograph of the holder. The suburban Atlanta company has been
making and distributing the cards since 1982, and currently has
sales of about $2 million.
   Company President Edward A. Zito said he adopted the name from a
California company that also made the cards under the name ``Trump
Cards.'' Zito said the California company went out of business in
1982 and never obtained a trademark.
   Zito said he was unfamiliar with Donald Trump at the time. Zito
does not play cards, but said he decided to stick with the trump
name after looking it up in a dictionary and deciding it was
appropriate for the product.
   PCL applied for a trademark registration in 1985, and Trump's
attorneys filed a notice of opposition after the government
published the request in 1988.
   In a written notice, Trump's attorneys alleged that PCL chose the
``Trump Cards'' name to ``benefit ... from the worldwide fame,
distribution and glamour of Donald J. Trump and his `Trump' name.''
   Trump's attorneys also argued the business cards would ``dilute''
the value of his name. As examples of the wide use of the Trump
name, they cited the Trump Parc condominiums in New York, the Trump
Tower office building in New York, the Trump Castle casino in
Atlantic City, N.J., and the Trump Plaza in West Palm Beach, Fla.
   A credit-type card called a ``Trump Card'' is used by patrons of
the casino, attorneys said.
   ``I think the fact is, if you ask people, when you hear the word
trump who do they think of, people associate it with Donald Trump,''
said James David Jacobs, Trump's attorney in New York.
   PCL attorney Ward, however, said, ``We maintain the idea that a
trump card is associated with a winning playing card. That was here
long before Donald Trump was on the scene. Can Donald Trump buy the
word `trump?'''
   ``Donald Trump wasn't a national figure when I got involved (in
business cards),'' Zito said. ``I hadn't heard of him anyway. The
first I heard of him was when (Trump's football team) the New Jersey
Generals recruited Herschel Walker (in 1983).''

   The U.S. dollar closed mixed against the major
currencies in Europe on Thursday. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said their markets traded in narrow
ranges, waiting for Friday's U.S. unemployment figures for June, an
important indicator of the state of the American economy.
   The dollar fell earlier in Tokyo, to 138.80 Japanese yen from
140.20 at Wednesday's close. But it traded higher against the yen in
London late Thursday at 139.10 yen.
   One British pound cost $1.6230 late Thursday in London, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6155.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Wednesday's late rates: 1.8885 West German marks, down from; 1.6210
Swiss francs, up from 1.6195; 6.4070 French francs, down from
6.4125; 2.1310 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1496; 1.1919 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1909; and 1,370.50 Italian lire, down from
1,380.50.
   Gold bullion prices were higher but traders said a feeling that
the dollar is going up made the rise a modest one.
   Gold closed in London at a bid $386.25 a troy ounce, up from
$385.50. The closing price in Zurich was $385.00 an ounce, up from
$384.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.45 an ounce, up from
$379.05.
   Silver bullion fell in London to $5.36 a troy ounce from $5.38
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   In order to chart the course of the
fast-growing personal computer mapping industry ... well, you'd need
a map.
   But one thing is clear even in the digital mapping maze _ the
personal computer mapping industry is a multimillion-dollar business.
   Companies are clamoring to stake their claim in the growing
market, which is beginning to attract the interest and dollars of
such major investors as communications mogul Rupert Murdoch, who
this year bought a West Coast mapping firm.
   The business centers on software and hardware that allows
companies to integrate their own databases with maps they buy, or to
create maps of their own. Software is available for less than $1,000.
   ``Mapping has been around for 20 years really, but the people
involved have been in forestry, land management, utilities ... not
profit-making organizations,'' said Lisa Thorell, formerly a mapping
industry analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. ``With people
moving mapping products to the PCs, the whole scene has changed.''
   The applications are many because any company that has
information or assets that are geographically dispersed can utilize
a map _ especially if it's displayed on a desktop computer. And
seeing information displayed geographically illustrates patterns
that may not be obvious from pie charts or rows and columns of
numbers.
   That's why one San Francisco outreach program now uses computer
mapping to help fight the spread of AIDS.
   ``We keep track of a wide variety of very detailed information
about our client contacts, including ethnic and sexual breakdowns.
... And we're keeping track of the amounts of condoms, bleach and
other disease-fighting agents we're putting out on the streets and
where,'' said Eric Margolis, director of research for Youth
Environment Study.
   The information is then mapped, allowing the program's workers to
see the AIDS patterns each month and target their efforts.
   Other possible uses might be by travel agents and auto clubs for
planning trips by clients, or by any business wanting to map and
analyze sales.
   ``The industry is limited principally by the amount of money
people have to buy this stuff,'' Thorell said.
   ``People with money in the commercial and financial area are very
interested in seeing their data in map formats.''
   There are more than 50 computer mapping systems on the market,
ranging from multimillion-dollar systems to cheaper personal
computer-based programs, according to H. Dennison Parker, publisher
of the trade publication GIS World, based in Fort Collins, Colo.
   Personal computer mapping is only a small portion of GIS _ or
geographic information systems _ technology that stores, overlays
and displays geographic and other types of data. While the simplest
PC software can display information, the more elaborate GIS systems
have sophisticated analytical capabilities.
   Dataquest reports that the entire computer mapping industry was
valued at $592 million worldwide for 1988, of which $58 million was
personal computer software and hardware. By 1992, Dataquest projects
the overall market will grow to $948 million, of which $222 million
will be the personal computer market segment.
   Other mapping industry observers think the business is even
bigger and may grow even faster than that.
   Michael Sena, president of Matrix Consultants in Boston,
estimates the mapping market totaled $750 million in 1988 and will
expand to between $3.5 billion and $5 billion by 1992. Sena
estimates that PC-based software and services may account for up to
30 percent of that market.
   Industry figures differ because they depend on how related
products and services are divided up, but the consensus is that the
business is on an upswing.
   ``I think that the industry is going to grow for another five to
10 years easily. ... The applications for mapping software are just
as broad as for desktop publishing,'' said Stephen Poizner,
president of Strategic Locations Planning, in San Jose, Calif.
   ``The 1990 census will provide an even greater boost to the whole
desktop mapping industry,'' Poizner said, because of the wealth of
information that will become available when it is released.
   Charles Hart, president and chief executive officer of Etak,
Inc., based in Menlo Park, Calif., agreed there was a strong
parallel between desktop mapping and desktop publishing, which made
computer publishing more accessible and sparked a boom in that
business.
   Etak began in 1983 as a company geared toward in-vehicle
navigation systems for cars. It has since entered and now emphasizes
fleet management systems and geographical data systems, which
include digital map databases.
   Etak is regarded as a leader in map digitizing, that is taking
existing maps and converting the information for computer use.
   ``It's a new emerging market, people don't know what to make of
it,'' Hart said.
   Earlier this year, Murdoch purchased Etak for an undisclosed
price said to be more than $30 million.
   ``This is the first time a major player has gotten involved in
the mapping industry,'' Hart said.
   Murdoch planned to utilize Etak's extensive map database in
projects like a worldwide reservation system, Hart said.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid conflicting weather
forecasts for the Midwestern corn and soybean country.
   ``There's supposed to be a minor cooldown before it heats up
again in a couple days and there could be some sporadic showers, but
it depends which forecaster you talk to,'' said Ted Mao, a grain
specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``It's just a very nervous weather market,'' he said.
   The day of active but unfocused trading followed a powerful rally
in Wednesday's session. The market's failure to build upon
Wednesday's gains _ which were based on forecasts for hot, dry
weather in the Corn Belt next week _ also was blamed for its
uncertain performance on Thursday.
   The corn market is especially sensitive to weather forecasts
because the Midwestern corn crop has entered its pollination phase,
a sensitive period when hot, dry conditions pose a particular threat.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 3{ cents lower to 4 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $4.08 a bushel;
corn was 2} cents lower to 6 cents higher with July at $2.81 a
bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 4{ cents lower with July at $1.63{ a
bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 3{ cents higher with July at
$7.71{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Beef in Her Past, She's the Secretary for Meat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jo Ann Smith is a beef person. She grew up on
it and remains a great fan of the standing rib roast. She was the
first woman ever to head the National Cattlemen's Association. She
is a fifth-generation cattle raiser.
   Now she regulates the industry she once promoted. But she rejects
the idea that as assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing
and inspection services, she might someday have to choose between
her loyalties to beef and her responsibilities to government.
   Meat has been Topic A all her life. Her husband, Cedric, also
comes from a cattleman's heritage. Both she and her husband come
from families that have raised cattle for generations. She is no
stranger to blue jeans and hard work.
   While she had to separate herself from the operation to accept
the $80,700 presidential appointment earlier this year, her husband
and son still run a 500-head, 4,500-acre ranch near Wacahoota, Fla.
   She was an equal partner. ``I always knew what Cedric was paying
for corn,'' she once told an interviewer.
   She was a conservative Democrat _ she underscores the
``conservative'' _ until 1988, when she campaigned for President
Bush. She ran twice for the Florida Legislature as a Democrat, but
lost both races.
   Then Mrs. Smith, 50, became involved in beef politics as head of
the Cattlemen's Association, one of the most powerful agricultural
lobbies. She helped drag a reluctant industry toward feeding and
breeding changes that produced leaner meat, but it was a struggle.
   ``We were very slow to respond,'' she says. ``You could see the
train coming.''
   ``I really do enjoy beef,'' she says and usually eats it once a
day.
   ``I am not a great lover of fish-fish,'' she says. She has come
to accept it but won't cook it: ``too messy.'' She'll eat it when
Cedric cooks it, which, she says, he does well.
   Her new job puts her in the midst of a dozen arguments, including
controversies over meat inspections _ the Reagan administration
wanted the industry to do more, and the government less _ and over
America's consumption of red meat.
   The health side of government says Americans eat too much of it.
The National Academy of Sciences, in a study that came out last
March, concluded in the most comprehensive evaluation ever of the
effects of diet on health that this country consumes too much fat
and gets too much of it from meat.
   The study advised ``eating lean meat in smaller and fewer
portions.''
   ``No, I don't think we consume too much,'' Mrs. Smith said in an
interview last week.
   She said the beef industry already has addressed the fat issue by
putting leaner beef on the market.
   ``We're producing a product that does not have the fat (it once
did),'' she said. ``We recognized that it was the fat that was the
culprit, not the product. And we have addressed that in genetics and
breeding. You can buy lean meat.''
   At the same time, Mrs. Smith endorsed labeling the fat content of
meat _ a position that could raise hackles among cattlemen.
   ``Labeling has certain strong advantages,'' she said. ``The
consumer wants to know. The only way they're going to know is to be
able to read something that (says) this is what the product has in
it.''
   It is a sensitive issue. Anne Winslow, director of nutrition
policy for Mrs. Smith's old organization, the 35,000-member
Cattlemen's Association, said it will be discussed at the group's
meeting in Columbus, Ohio, this month.
   ``Proud producers might view the issue as a positive opportunity
to highlight the nutritional density of the product, beef,'' said
Ms. Winslow, adding that her own recommendation will be for labels
that show how much fat remains after cooking _ after fat has been
trimmed and drained away. She said the stress on fat has turned
attention away from the high iron, zinc and vitamin B-12 contents of
beef.
   Mrs. Smith's pro-label stand and her support for federal
inspection of seafood _ an issue on which the Agriculture Department
has yet to take a stand _ wins applause from the ever-vigilant
consumer movement.
   ``For an industry person, she's more of an activist than you'd
expect,'' says Ellen Haas of Public Voice for Food and Health
Policy. ``She has an understanding about what can be done. She has
been out front on fish inspection.''
   But on some other food issues in her domain, Mrs. Smith tends
toward caution.
   She is waiting for more study to be conducted before taking a
stand on whether meat producers who give their cattle no hormones or
other growth-enhancing drugs should be able to label their product
``organic'' or ``natural.''
   Some cattlemen who have been using a ``natural'' label and who
have found a market among health-conscious consumers say the
government has been trying to get them to drop the label.
   Mrs. Smith said her discomfort with the label is that ``we have
never defined `natural.' Remember that every animal in order to be
bred has hormone in it. The problem that has arisen is, does the
consumer understand this. You want to know that your label is
truthful.''
   On veal issues, Mrs. Smith dodged questions, saying she wasn't
familiar with them. The Center for Science in the Public Interest
and other consumer groups contend that the way some veal calves are
raised _ kept in dark pens so small the calf can't turn around and
fed only a liquid diet to keep the meat light-colored _ are inhumane.
   High residues of antibiotics have been found in veal, the
center's Dan Howell told a congressional subcommittee on June 6.
Mrs. Smith said she knows nothing about raising veal calves and will
have to do her homework on that.

   Assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual
funds rose $2.83 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record $323.63 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a revised $462.3 million drop in the
funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group. The previous week's drop originally was
reported by the group as $445.8 million.
   The funds' assets hit the previous record high of $321.26 billion
in the week ended June 21, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $1.99 billion to $105.03
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $582.3 million
to $136.60 billion, and assets of 143 institutional funds rose
$256.8 million to $81.99 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.85 percent from 8.89 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.91 percent from 8.96 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 38
days, down from 39 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.55 percent as of Wednesday from 6.56 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was 5.14 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.79
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.84 the
previous week. Yields were 8.83 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.89 percent; 8.66 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.73 percent;
and 8.63 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.67 percent.

   The stock market eked out its third straight gain
in another quiet session Thursday as traders awaited the latest
monthly report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.88 to 2,462.44,
bringing its gain since the start of the week to 22.38 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
965 up, 530 down and 503 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.45 million
shares, against 127.70 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 166.37 million shares.
   The Labor Department is due to issue statistics Friday on the
employment situation for June.
   Analysts expect the figures to show growth at the rate of as much
as 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, more than double the
101,000 preliminary increase reported for May.
   But they also maintain that the June figure will be inflated by a
quirk in the timing of surveys on which the data are based.
   Thus, some argue, the latest evidence may not deter the Federal
Reserve from relaxing its credit policy to cushion the impact of a
slowdown in business activity.
   Brokers added that a pickup in employment might be warmly
received anyway in the financial world right now, by serving to calm
the recession worries that began to flare up late last month.
   Armstrong World Industries rose 1] to 49\ in active trading on
top of a 4]-point jump Wednesday, when the company said the Belzberg
family of Vancouver, B.C., had acquired 9.85 percent of its stock
and was considering a possible bid for the rest.
   Takeover rumors and speculation lifted several other issues,
among them Syntex, up } at 50; UAL, up 5{ at 152{, and Whitman, up 1
at 34|.
   General Public Utilities rose | to 40~, surpassing highs dating
back to the 1960s. The company, whose stock traded as low as 3] in
the aftermath of the accident at its Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant 10 years ago, raised its quarterly dividend from 45 to 55
cents a share.
   In over-the-counter trading, Apple Computer climbed } to 41\ and
Adobe Systems dropped 2] to 24{. Apple said it planned to sell its
16.4 percent stake in Adobe and was developing products to compete
with some Adobe technologies.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.80 billion, or 0.34
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.57 to 178.92.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.02 to 367.19, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .91 at 321.55.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.63 to 439.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 361.11, up 1.99.

   Sagging consumer demand and swollen inventories
may have automakers looking at end-of-the-model-year fire sales or
further production cutbacks accompanied by layoffs, industry
analysts said Thursday.
   Domestic automakers, which assemble more than three-fourths of
the vehicles sold in the United States, reported Wednesday that car
and light truck sales for the first half of 1989 were down 4.8
percent from the same period last year.
   That bolstered what analysts have been saying for months:
automakers have been making too many vehicles while demand was
weaker than anticipated. Slower sales plus excessive production add
up to bloated inventories.
   Estimates vary, but industry watchers say automakers have new car
supplies as high as 80 days at the current selling rate. Because
supplies should be between 60 and 70 days, something has to spur
new-car sales or to slow inventory growth during the rest of the
year.
   ``The industry is going to be very hard pressed to turn the
spigot on for the third quarter,'' auto analyst John Kirnan of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York said Thursday. ``You've got the
greatest levels of incentives out there and they don't seem to be
generating the interest.''
   The combination of buyer incentives in effect since April _
including cut-rate financing or cash rebates on everything from
subcompacts to luxury models _ and high inventories should have
lured consumers into showrooms. But that has not been happening.
   Furthermore, increased cash-back incentives or lower cut-rate
financing do not appear to be the breeze to fan a sales fire, said
Bill Meier, general manager of Ray Green Chevrolet in Jacksonville,
Ill.
   ``It's been slow and it's beginning to taper off,'' he said
Thursday. ``I was here in '79 and '80 and it was bad back then.
We'll come around.''
   In the short run, times may be getting tougher for the
automakers, their dealers and their factory workers. One way to fix
inventory problems is production cuts, and that means layoffs.
   ``I think there will be some, it's just a question of degree,''
said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York.
``I'm looking for some significant cutbacks.''
   A United Auto Workers spokesman who declined to be identified
said the union was watching sales and production figures closely to
ensure that any production cuts and layoffs are warranted under
contracts with automakers.
   During the past few months, automakers have been selectively
shutting down production at plants making a variety of cars. The
closings have been relatively brief, mostly lasting for a week or
two.
   In the next few months, plants will close for vacations and to be
retooled for the 1990 models, a process that usually takes two
weeks. This week and next, Ford Motor Co. has scheduled no
production at any of its assembly plants.
   On Thursday, Ward's Automotive Reports said domestic automakers'
production levels were sharply lower during the week this year than
a year ago. The trade journal said automakers scheduled the
production of 71,167 cars and trucks in the United States during the
week this year, 42.6 percent lower than the 124,029 vehicles they
produced during the same week last year.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three key measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended June 26, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$1.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $769.7 billion from $768.1
billion the previous week.
   The central bank said the measure known as M2 rose $2.9 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $3,094.6 billion from $3,091.7 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $400 million to a seasonally
adjusted $3,978.2 billion from $3,977.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,082.2 billion, a 1.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,962.7 billion, up 3.0 percent, while M1 fell
5.7 percent to an average of $777.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $612 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$811 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $289.5 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from
$290.0 billion two weeks earlier.

   Energy futures prices slumped Thursday as labor
problems in the North Sea showed signs of easing.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 46 cents to close at $20.33 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract rose
52 cents.
   The August contract for home heating oil fell 1.17 cents a gallon
to close at 49.89 cents after rising the same amount on Wednesday.
Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery dropped 1.15 cents
to settle at 56.27 cents a gallon after falling 0.35 cent Wednesday.
   Richard Redoglia, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said reports that British oil maintenance workers in the North Sea
would end a strike and return to work sent prices lower.
   The New York market had rallied in recent sessions on concerns
that the walkout would cut oil supplies. But prices began falling in
Europe when it appeared the strike was ending, giving U.S. traders
the cue to sell, Redoglia said.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Slide Further After Brazil Evades Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Raw coffee futures prices slid to new 8-year lows Thursday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as the battered market reacted
to news that an expected freeze in the Brazilian coffee fields had
not materialized.
   On other markets, sugar futures fell sharply for the second
straight day; energy futures fell; pork futures continued to
retreat; grains and soybeans were mixed; and precious metals were
mixed.
   Coffee settled 1.49 cents to 6.62 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in July at 93.38 cents a pound.
   The selloff erased all of Wednesday's gains and deepened the
market's anxiety stemming from the suspension of coffee export
quotas Monday by the International Coffee Organization.
   Some analysts believe the lifting of quotas _ the result of
long-running discord among the 74 coffee-producing and consuming
nations that make up the organization _ will result in a flood of
high-quality coffees that had been withheld from the market in a bid
to stabilize prices.
   Coffee futures had rallied Wednesday on expectations for a freeze
in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer.
   But frost touched only a few areas, skirting the main producing
regions altogether, said Esther Eskenasy, an analyst with Cargill
Investor Services Inc. in New York.
   She said producer selling of coffee occurred at price levels
above 98 cents a pound but dried up at lower levels.
   Most of the offers to sell coffee futures below 98 cents a pound
came from European traders, who expect the availability of raw
coffee to balloon in the near future.
   ``I think the market will continue to be under pressure because
of all these supplies that they have not been able to sell'' due to
the quotas, Ms. Eskenasy said.
   Sugar futures lengthened their steep slide on the Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange. Analysts said the market was correcting from an
overbought condition after making strong gains in mid-June.
   Sugar settled .18 cent to the permitted limit of .50 cent lower
with October at 13.12 cents a pound.
   Energy futures sagged on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
reports that striking maintenance and construction workers planned
to return to work Friday on North Sea oil production platforms.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 26 cents to 54 cents lower
with August at $20.30 a barrel; heating oil was 1.01 cents to 1.32
cents lower with August at 49.89 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .15 cent to 1.15 cents lower with August at 56.27 cents a gallon.
   Hog and pork-belly futures sank for the third consecutive session
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a continuing reaction to last
Friday's quarterly Agriculture Department report showing an
unexpectedly large number of hogs and pigs on U.S. farms.
   Cattle futures struggled to a mixed close.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher with July at
70.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent to .40 cent higher
with August at 81.02 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent to .65 cent
lower with July at 46.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .60
cent to the limit 2 cents lower with July at 30.47 cents a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures fell sharply late in the session on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for slightly cooler
temperatures and spotty showers in the Midwest this weekend.
   Wheat settled 4{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $4.05
a bushel; corn was { cent to 8 cents lower with July at $2.78} a
bushel; oats were 4} cents to 8 cents lower with July at $1.60 a
bushel; soybeans were 4} cents to 13 cents lower with July at $7.65
a bushel.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 20 cents to 70
cents higher with August at $388.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.6
cents to 1.7 cents lower with July at $5.377 a troy ounce.

   A favorable court ruling has prompted
Spalding Worldwide Sports Inc. to seek millions of dollars in
damages from competitors that it says have illegally copied its
patented golf ball covering.
   Spalding, the nation's biggest golf ball maker, filed suits
against three other major golf ball manufacturers immediately after
a judge on Wednesday upheld its patent infringment claim against
rival, Acushnet Co., Robert K. Adikes, Spalding's general counsel,
said Thursday.
   At issue in the case was a golf ball covering Spalding had
patented and which the company claims is illegally used by 95
percent of the industry.
   Spalding, which filed suit against Acushnet in 1981, has pending
suits against MacGregor Sporting Goods Inc. and Wilson Sporting
Goods Co. Another golf ball maker, Ram, settled for an undisclosed
sum in 1986.
   Wally Uihlein, president and chief executive officer of Acushnet
said the company planned to appeal U.S. District Judge Edward F.
Harrington's decision.
   ``It's a very, very complex patent issue,'' Uihlein said. ``It's
a classic case where somebody may look at a glass of water and see
it as half full and someone else might look at it as half empty.''
   Acushnet agreed to stop using the disputed process on its golf
balls in 1986 pending the outcome of Spalding's suit.
   Adikes declined to say how much Spalding would seek in damages at
a separate hearing to be scheduled following Acushnet's appeal.
However, he estimated that the interest charges alone would reach
into the millions of dollars.
   Spalding, which makes Top-Flite balls, and Acushnet, which
markets the Titleist line, control about 80 percent of the $500
million-a-year golf ball market.
   Adikes said the only manufacturers not now using the Spalding
process are Achusnet and Ram.
   Robert Molitor, Spalding's vice president for research, developed
the method of coating golf balls with a blend of plastic Surlyn
resins in 1971.
   ``Originally our aim was to make the ball more durable and
resistent to cracking in the cold,'' said Tom Mayer, director of
marketing for Spalding. ``It did that, but then we discovered it
also added increased distance and we immediately patented it.''
   Spalding's 17-year patent issued in 1974 expires in 1991.
   ``No one could find anything that worked as well so everyone else
started copying the process in the 1980s,'' he said.

   The dollar closed narrowly higher Thursday
against all key currencies in thin, uneventful trading after a mixed
performance overseas.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. On the New York Commodity
Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose 40 cents to $386.40
a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid
for gold at $384.25, down 35 cents from late Wednesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started out higher as traders
looked for bargains following Wednesday's selloff, which stemmed
from continued fears that interest rates will fall because the U.S.
economy is slowing.
   Gary Lutnick, a trader in the New York office of Banco di
Sicilia, said the currency traded in a fairly narrow range
throughout the session in anticipation of Friday's unemployment data
for June, an important indicator of the state of the economy.
   ``People were trying to limit their exposure due to the
unemployment numbers,'' he said.
   Some dealers said they expected the employment figures to show
growth at the rate of about 200,000 in nonfarm payroll employment,
about double the 101,000 preliminary increase reported for May.
   Lutnick said traders also were awaiting the start of next week's
Group of Seven meeting in Washington to learn more about the
industrialized nations' views on currency exchange rates. The
so-called G-7 includes the United States and its six major trading
partners _ Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to 138.80 Japanese yen from 140.20 yen Wednesday. It
traded higher in London at 139.10 yen, and in New York at 138.88
yen, up from 138.40 yen late Wednesday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. One pound cost
$1.6230 in London, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.6155. Sterling
bought $1.6265 in New York, down from $1.6285.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.8850 West German marks, up from 1.8820;
1.6175 Swiss francs, up from 1.6115; 1.1916 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1908; 6.3935 French francs, up from 6.3875; and 1,365.50
Italian lire, up from 1,362.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.8885 West German marks, down from 1.8907; 1.6210 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6195; 6.4070 French francs, down from 6.4125;
2.1310 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1496; 1.1919 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1909; and 1,370.50 Italian lire, down from 1,380.50.
   Gold rose in London to $386.25 an ounce from $385.50, and in
Zurich, Switzerland, to $385 an ounce from $384.50. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold closed at $384.45 an ounce, up from $379.05 Wednesday.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.377 a troy ounce from $5.393 Wednesday.
Silver slipped in London to $5.36 an ounce from $5.38.

   MCI Telecommunications Inc. has won a contract
potentially worth up to $20 million over two years to provide
long-distance telephone service to the legislative branch, officials
said Thursday.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the Senate Rules Committee,
and Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Administration Committee, selected MCI based on recommendations from
a team that included staff from the architect of the Capitol's
office.
   MCI was chosen over U.S. Sprint and the American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. in a competitive bidding process, said Dan Hanlon, a
spokesman for the architect. The final contract should be awarded
within three months, he said.
   The selection boosts the fortunes of MCI, a Washington-based
company which was part of a team that lost its bid to provide
long-distance service to the rest of the government.
   The General Services Administraton awarded that business _
potentially worth $25 billion over ten years _ to AT&amp;T and U.S.
Sprint in December 1988.
   Pam Small, a MCI spokesman, said Thursday's decision was a ``very
important contract for MCI'' that underscores the company's ability
to do business with the government.
   MCI will replace a system in which several companies have
provided long-distance service to the legislative branch, comprised
of the Senate, the House, the Library of Congress, the General
Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office and Congressional
Budget Office and the Office of Technology Assessment.
   Hanlon said the contract will cost between $5 million and $10
million annually, a savings of nearly half for the legislative
branch. Long-distance service now costs between $20 million and $30
million a year, he said.
   The initial contract will be for two years, which options for
renewal.

   Vestron Inc. officials declined to comment
Thursday on a published report that the troubled movie company
failed to make payment on a $25 million loan.
   The Advocate newspaper of Stamford reported that Vestron failed
to make the payment, due July 3, to Wells Fargo bank.
   The newspaper said its information came from sources who asked
not to be identified.
   Vestron, based in Stamford, dismissed 140 employees last week as
a cost-cutting move. Vestron produces motion pictures and
distributes videos.
   The company's only hit movie was the 1987 release ``Dirty
Dancing.''

   The U.S. dollar opened higher Friday against the
Japanese yen, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately in early trading.
   The dollar opened at 139.33 yen, up 0.43 yen from Thursday's
close of 138.90 yen, which also was the level at which it closed in
New York overnight.
   Dealers said trading in Tokyo started in a cautious mood as
investors avoided major moves ahead of the release of U.S.
unemployment figures for June later Friday.
   The dollar in New York inched up overnight on expectations that
the jobless rate might be better than expected.
   The dollar-yen rate was moving little in Tokyo Friday morning,
said a Bank of Tokyo trader, who spoke anonymously.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average quickly
earned 113.76 points, or 0.34 percent, rising to 33,537.24 points
within the first 15 minutes of morning trading. The index had gained
113.77 points Thursday.
   The upward move followed a slight gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 major issues in New York overnight.

   The government ban on almost all uses of
asbestos came as no surprise to auto manufacturers who already had
been phasing out the cancer-causing substance, industry officials
said Thursday.
   ``We have known that we should be eliminating asbestos from
various parts of our products,'' Fred Bowditch, vice president for
technical affairs at the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of
the United States, said from the organization's office in Detroit.
   New regulations, announced by Environmental Protection Agency
administrator William Reilly, will end the manufacture of most
asbestos products in three phases over the next seven years.
   Among the items covered by the ban are automobile and small truck
brake linings, disc brake pads, clutches and automatic transmission
components, with that ban scheduled to begin in 1993 for 1994 models.
   The EPA rule does not affect products already in use.
   Some auto manufacturers have replaced the asbestos disc brakes in
the front of many vehicles with Kevlar, a synthetic fabric used with
resin, or some type of metallic fiber, industry officials said.
   They are still in the process of phasing out asbestos in the rear
drum brakes.
   ``Twenty-five percent of our cars are asbestos free in the rear
brakes and more than half of the trucks,'' said Toni Simonetti, a
spokeswoman for General Motors Corp., which introduced asbestos-free
front brakes during the 1970s.
   Ben Dunn, engineering and design public relations manager for
Chrysler, said the company has proceeded cautiously because brakes
are one of the most critical systems on a vehicle and consumer
expectations remain high.
   Replacing asbestos is difficult because substitute materials
can't be used across the board as manufacturers have been able to do
with asbestos.
   ``The bottom line is we're working as fast as we can to get
there,'' Dunn said.
   Brake producers have long expected the ban and are gradually
replacing asbestos with other products, said James Murray, president
of Nuturn Corp., of Nashville, Tenn. Asbestos is used in only about
25 percent of the company's products, he said.
   ``If asbestos was banned tomorrow, we would continue to produce a
product,'' he said. ``It could be converted overnight.''
   Ilene Industries of Shelbyville, Tenn., no longer uses asbestos
to manufacture brake linings and industrial gaskets, and this week
the company is removing its remaining stock of asbestos sheet
packing from its storeroom, vice president Ray Smith said.
   Whether the switch from asbestos to other materials translates
into sticker shock for some consumers remains an open question among
industry officials.
   Although he did not have precise figures, Bowditch said he did
not believe the change would mean much steeper prices.
   However, Ms. Simonetti, without providing exact figures, said the
substitute material is ``relatively more expensive.''
   Reaction to the ban from other organizations was mixed.
   ``I'm pleased to see EPA has taken some action since that law has
been in effect since 1976 and little has been done,'' said Peggy
Seminario, associate director of the occupation safety and health
department of the AFL-CIO.
   Seminario expressed the hope that the EPA will strictly regulate
the asbestos substitutes used by manufacturers. ``They may pose
significant hazards as well,'' she said.
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, consumer activist Ralph
Nader's organization, said the ban is ``too far in the future,''
forcing Americans to live with a material that the scientific
community has already labeled as dangerous.
   Karen Florini, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund,
said her organization was encouraged by the EPA's action.
   ``Finally EPA is preventing asbestos pollution by requiring
people to switch to less dangerous materials,'' Florini said. ``By
banning asbestos products, EPA has stopped the entire cycle of
asbestos exposures, from mining to processing and from distribution
to disposal.''
   But Ellen Silbergeld, a toxicologist with the Environmental
Defense Fund, said the ban was long overdue.
   ``Asbestos has left a wake of disease and death around the world
due to piecemeal regulations that have failed to prevent its
hazards,'' she said.
   The White Lung Association, a group that represents asbestos
victims, said it ``fully supports'' the EPA ban, but said the agency
is not going far enough. The group said the EPA should also require
a recall of asbestos products in use and increase federal funds for
asbestos removal from buildings.
   Jacqueline Warren, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, questioned why the EPA is not requiring a faster phase-in
of the ban, especially as it applies to brake parts where
substitutes already are available.
