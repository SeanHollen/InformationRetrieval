   The father of three purported drug barons
begged the government on Tuesday to end its fierce anti-narcotics
drive and negotiate peace, as Colombia moved to extradite a reputed
drug finance chief to America.
   The developments came as the city of Medellin was hit by seven
bombs.
   Police also said Tuesday night they frustrated a planned rocket
attack on a state-owned distillery there. Four imported,
high-powered rockets were found aimed at an alcohol storage tank
outside the Licores de Antioquia plant in Medellin, a police
spokesmen said.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, identified as a major financial man for
the Medellin cocaine cartel, was told by Colombian authorities
Tuesday they plan to hand him over to the United States for trial,
Colombian television said.
   According to the Tuesday night report by the private syndicated
news program Noticiero 24 Horas, Martinez was formally notified
during the day of plans to extradite him.
   The Medellin cartel is the world's largest cocaine trafficking
organization. Martinez is wanted by a federal court in Atlanta on
charges related to a $1.2 billion drug money-laundering operation.
   Martinez was told he had until Tuesday to appeal the extradition,
the report said.
   It was the first word that the United States had completed
extradition paperwork and made a formal request for Martinez, a
35-year-old econmist. He was the first of at least four extraditable
suspects to be caught up in a sweep aimed at drug traffickers.
   The U.S. Embassy has said it will not comment on any extradition
proceedings.
   The Martinez case is seen as a test of Colombia's resolve to
press its attack on drug dealers. They have cowed the courts in this
South American country through assassinations, threats and bribes.
   Meanwhile, Fabio Ochoa Restrepo, the father of three reputed
cocaine kingpins, appealed in an open letter to President Virgilio
Barco to bury the hatchet and agree to talk to the drug barons.
   ``Let there be dialogue, let there be peace, let's have
forgiveness, let's carry out a kind of erasing and clean slate,''
Ochoa Restrepo wrote.
   The letter was published on Tuesday in a Bogota newspaper.
   In Washington, Justice Minister Monica de Greiff reiterated the
Barco government's refusal to negotiate with drug traffickers, who
are blamed for the assassination Aug. 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan,
a leading presidential candidate. The slaying led to the crackdown
on drug trafficking.
   Colombia's police intelligence chief said Tuesday that among the
more than 11,000 people arrested in the crackdown, one has been
implicated in Galan's death. Earlier, news reports pointed to
Abraham Majuat, reputedly a top financial man for drug dealers, but
the reports could not be confirmed.
   Bombs exploded at six state liquor stores Tuesday in Medellin.
The shops are a source of patronage for political leaders.
   A seventh bomb went off outside a tourist agency office in Bogota.
   No one was hurt, police said. They estimated damage at $100,000.
   A man who identified himself as a spokesman for drug traffickers
claimed responsibility for the bombings Tuesday and nine bombs that
exploded in Medellin on Sunday. The claim came in phone calls to
Medellin radio stations.
   In his emotional appeal, which was dated Saturday and appeared in
the Bogota daily El Tiempo, Ochoa Restrepo called on Barco to ``stop
the bloodshed in our poor and dear Colombia.''
   ``Nobody in the world ever won a war, all that is left are
orphans, widows and pained mothers,'' said Ochoa Restrepo, 65. He
said traffickers should be called on ``to stop dead'' their
activities, ``no more drug trafficking, no more war, no more
killings, no more bombs, no more fire.''
   He identified himself in the letter as ``father of three
extraditables. The poor little ones, may God shelter them.''
   Neither U.S. nor Colombian authorities have accused Ochoa
Restrepo of trafficking. But his three sons, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez,
Juan Ochoa Vazsquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez, are alleged to be among
the kingpins of the Medellin cartel and are wanted by the United
States.
   Drug agents believe the cartel is responsible for 80 percent of
the cocaine distributed in the United States.
   Ochoa Restrepo said traffickers facing extradition ``say they
prefer a tomb in Colombia to a jail cell for life in the United
States, which is to be dead in life, as are so many that we have
there. In this I think they're right.''
   He said any negotiated concessions by the traffickers would also
require concessions by leftist guerrillas.
   The traffickers allegedly have equipped and financed right-wing
paramilitary death squads that have killed hundreds of suspected
leftists and provided security and assassination services for the
traffickers.
   The Miami Herald and also the Washington Post, quoting a
confidential report by Colombian security forces, reported that at
least five Israeli and 11 British mercenaries helped train teams of
assassins for Colombian cocaine traffickers and their right-wing
allies.
   The U.S. State Department said it asked Britain to investigate
allegations some of its citizens were involved.
   In Washington, Mrs. de Greiff pledged Tuesday to continue to
fight her country's drug lords despite death threats, and she
appealed for more U.S. aid to protect judges.
   She disputed reports that she had considered resigning in the
face of death threats against her, her husband and their 3-year-old
son.
   She said she was requesting $19 million to purchase armored cars,
bulletproof vests, metal detectors for courts and other security
devices.
   President Bush has approved $65 million to help the Colombian
government fight the drug cartels and $5 million to help protect
judges.

<HEAD>Soviet Activists Seek Contacts, Publicity, Equipment in West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago, Sergei Grigoryants was in a Soviet
labor camp, ostracized and imprisoned by his government for what it
called slander.
   Today, he is among a new breed of globe-trotting Soviet activists
flocking to the West to pitch their causes, attend seminars, meet
government leaders and finally shake hands with people whose
stubborn support kept many of them going.
   Unlike Soviet tourists and emigrants, these activists also are
forging new contacts with people who will support them when they
return home. Along the way they are amassing an arsenal of donated
computers, printers and FAX machines to open new, electronic windows
on the once-closed Soviet society.
   The number of activists visiting the West has soared since 1986,
the year after President Mikhail Gorbachev launched his reforms.
They range from veteran Moscow dissidents who spent years in jail
for their beliefs to pro-independence Baltic activists spurred by
Gorbachev's programs.
   Nearly every top leader of the three independent ``popular
front'' groups in the Baltic republics has visited Europe, the
United States or Canada in the last year. Leading Moscow activists
such as Lev Timofeyev and Sergei Kovalyov have crossed both
continents, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov has
returned to the West twice since his first visit last year.
   But Soviet authorities still tightly control travel visas for
personal and business trips, leaving wide speculation about the
Kremlin's motives for allowing activists to ply their trade freely
abroad.
   ``I'd shy away from conspiracy theories, but it obviously builds
up Gorbachev's reputation. He obviously believes enough in his
reforms to allow this,'' said Ginte Damusis of the Lithuanian
Information Center in New York.
   ``Gorbachev wants to appear as a peaceful ... law-abiding
figure,'' said Ludmilla Thorne, Soviet affairs director at the New
York-based human rights organization Freedom House. ``They don't
want bad publicity.''
   Jeri Laber, executive director of Helsinki Watch in New York,
suggested the Kremlin simply is less concerned about activists'
influence. ``Somebody there has realized it's not so bad when these
people speak out.''
   A Soviet Embassy spokesman in Washington said only that Kremlim
policy on visas for travel to the West doesn't discriminate between
activists and all other Soviet travelers, whose total number could
reach 2 million this year.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, president of the Lithuanian independence
movement Sajudis, said he didn't know why authorities let him visit
the United States and Europe, but that he had more important things
on his mind.
   ``There is an opportunity to maintain contacts, to establish new
contacts,'' the 56-year-old musicologist said through an interpreter
last month in New York. ``I hope that Sajudis will be known not just
by name only, but as a very real movement and representative of its
people, its nation.''
   Landsbergis, who became an activist only in the last two years,
said his trip reaffirmed Sajudis' rejection of Soviet authority,
imposed on the Baltics under a 1939 pact signed by Josef Stalin and
Adolf Hitler.
   ``We're raising questions about the authority of our
representatives abroad. Can we expect emigres or other governments
to represent us?''
   He met with State Department officials, congressmen, a former
White House policymaker and Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO,
which has appointed a representative to deal with Lithuania's
fledgling independent labor union.
   Just a few weeks before, the 48-year-old Grigoryants met with
Vice President Dan Quayle and other officials and activists and
signed an agreement with Freedom House to fax daily installments of
his journal to America.
   Grigoryants, the Georgian publisher of the journal Glasnost, was
freed in 1987 after four years in a labor camp for publishing an
underground journal. He formally came to America to accept the
Golden Pen of Freedom Award from the International Association of
Independent Journalists.
   A State Department spokeswoman would not comment on any of the
meetings, saying only that U.S. policy is to meet with all Soviet
activists.
   ``One of their intentions for contacts with the West is to be so
well known that if a crackdown came, they'd be well known enough to
protect themselves,'' said Martin Zvaners of the American Latvian
Association in Washington. ``The fact that these people are coming
to the West, showing their faces, gives (Westerners) a stake
personally in their fate.''
   The activists also are ``seeing us working and they get an idea
about how they could work. They see participation in a real
parliamentary democracy,'' said Robert Van Voren, director of the
Bukovsky Foundation in Amsterdam.
   But ideas and contacts aren't the only things activists take home.
   Grigoryants handed Thorne a list of supplies, from staples to
computers, for his Moscow office, which was stripped by KGB agents
and Internal Security forces last year. Thorne said she wasn't sure
if all his requests were filled, but that his wife, Tamara, earlier
in the year had carried a personal computer back to Moscow after
visiting the West.
   Landsbergis picked up a desktop publishing system with which
Sajudis hopes to put out a daily newspaper from Vilnius, the
Lithuanian capital.
   Baltic, Armenian and Georgian activists regularly use fax
machines they got from the West to send dispatches to Western
activists, the recipients said.
   ``One fax can perform miracles,'' said Eduard Gudava, executive
director of the New York-based Center for Democracy in the U.S.S.R.
``They can stop all this travel. ... But they cannot cut all the
telephone lines.''
   The center receives daily dispatches from the human rights
journal Express-Khronika and translates them for Western media. Such
independent reporting will make Moscow think twice before sending
troops against protesters, Gudava said.
   ``It's impossible now to keep information inside the Soviet Union
about such things,'' he said.
   Still, nothing can replace face-to-face contact, said Van Voren.
``They would be doing their jobs even without these trips. But it's
easier to discuss things in person _ you know, they still have bugs
in their offices.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas on the 6,000-foot
volcano looming over San Salvador's northwestern limits have turned
the working-class neighborhood of San Ramon into another
bullet-pocked battlefront.
   Contingents of leftist rebels have come down the slopes four
times in nine months to attack an army post in the center of the
ramshackle district of 30,000 people.
   The attacks are part of a year-old guerrilla campaign to bring
their war against the government into the capital. The Salvadoran
military says the guerrillas are making urban attacks because
they've failed elsewhere.
   But three of the four raids were staged in daylight, illustrating
the guerrillas' confidence in their ability to at least partly
neutralize the government's single greatest tactical advantage: air
power.
   ``Each time the combat is more fierce,'' said Marta Teresa
Figueroa, a vendor in the stall-lined market alley hard hit by the
fighting. ``It will happen again, and next time it will be worse.''
   She stood 10 feet from the spot where Santos Barrera, a
60-year-old mason, was killed by a bullet in the head the afternoon
of Aug. 1. That raid also left a soldier dead, another wounded and
two civilians _ a market-stall owner and her daughter _ wounded.
   Three of Barrera's grandchildren stood on the stoop of his humble
cinder-block home and told how they huddled under beds while the
fighting raged for two hours.
   Asked if the attacks made her afraid to come to the market,
16-year-old cheese-seller Julieta Lopez said, ``Yes. But necessity
obliges us to risk our lives.''
   Though residents of San Ramon have nothing against the soldiers
manning the post, several said there is a feeling that the
detachment should be withdrawn, or at least moved from the
district's center.
   Miguel Angel Rivera's arm is still bandaged and in a sling from a
wound he received in November during the first attack on San Ramon.
He had stopped to light a cigarette for a soldier when the first
fusillade exploded out of the darkness.
   The bone in the 21-year-old bus fare-taker's upper arm was
shattered, the artery severed and much of the nerve destroyed.
   ``They should remove the post to a more isolated place,'' he
said, standing a block from the one-story house that serves as the
15-man detachment's headquarters and barracks.
   The house is distinguished from its neighbors by green-and-black
camouflage daub and sandbag positions at its corners.
   ``There are too many people around here _ the market, the school,
the church, people who have nothing to do with the conflict _ and
things happen to them,'' Rivera said.
   Sgt. Mario Ventura Lopez, a stocky 51-year-old former
paratrooper, commands the post. A 32-year army veteran, Ventura lost
a lung from a wound suffered in combat with the rebels in 1982.
   Standing next to a patched hole in the wall where an antitank
rocket struck in the previous attack, Ventura said his detachment
was there ``to protect the community from these terrorist
delinquents.''
   He estimated that about 100 rebels took part in the attack Aug.
1. His troops were reinforced soon after it began by scores of 1st
Brigade soldiers on constant patrol around the San Salvador
volcano's base.
   A UH-1H helicopter with two M-60 machine-guns _ one of 70
U.S.-supplied choppers in the Salvadoran air force _ circled about
3,000 feet above San Ramon shortly after the battle began, too high
for its gunfire to be effective.
   The helicopters aren't coming in as close as they used to because
the guerrillas have acquired several hundred Soviet-designed
Dragunov sniper rifles, which have a range of 800 yards, compared
with about 300 yards for an ordinary assault rifle. The helicopters
have been taking more hits and abandoning more missions.
   With government air power reduced, the rebels have been able to
launch more daytime attacks than at any time in the last four years
of the conflict that began nearly a decade ago.
   Ventura contended his post is getting ever-greater acceptance and
support from the local people.
   ``They're tiring of seeing the way the terrorists' actions affect
the civilian population,'' he said.
   But a dozen residents interviewed indicated little or no
animosity toward the attackers. It was clear, however, they were
sick of the war.
   ``One asks oneself whey the two sides are fighting, and one
doesn't find an answer,'' said a produce vendor who preferred not to
give her name.
   Even Rivera says he has nothing against the rebel who wounded him
so severely.
   ``It was just bad luck,'' he said.

   ``Good evening, the headlines tonight,'' Sue Lawley
tells BBC-TV viewers. ``Britain has sent a warning to Herr Hitler:
we will stand by Poland whatever the consequences.''
   There's an eerie quality to ``News 39,'' a weeklong series of
mock newscasts that marries 50-year-old old footage to high-tech TV
to recreate the last days before World War II.
   With her reassuringly English tones, as well as the period
jewelry she bought especially for the program, this doyenne of
British television seems born to the role of wartime newscaster.
   But at 43, Ms. Lawley wasn't even born when the war ended. And
computer graphics have an unsettling impact as they mingle with
grainy black-and-white photos of helmeted Germans and gas-masked
babies.
   The reporters on the 15-minute news roundups are real, like Tim
Sebastian, reporting on evacuees coming home from the Continent, or
Charles Wheeler, the BBC's White House correspondent, now
``reporting from Berlin'' and appearing in color against a backdrop
of the Brandenburg Gate in black and white.
   Britain is being deluged with memories of Sept. 1-3, 1939, when
Adolf Hitler invaded Poland and Britain declared war on Germany.
   The TV schedules are saturated with documentaries and drama.
Newspapers are publishing special supplements.
   More than 100 new books about the war are being published, from
fresh histories to coffee-table volumes of photographs. The emphasis
is on the small, almost forgotten details of life on the home front.
   ``News 39'' even claims to have unearthed a 50-year-old scoop:
newly discovered footage of crowds falling over rubber balls that
were strewn by an anti-war protester outside the prime minister's
Downing Street residence.
   This week ``will be a time of sadness for many. For some it will
bring a nostalgic smile, a memory of a small but personal part in
history,'' says Paul Fox, managing director of BBC-TV.
   ``For those born after the event it will be a time to learn what
happened and why.''
   But for some, it's too much. ``All those trench coats. All those
tin hats. All those smiling cockneys with a mug of tea amid the
sepia ruins of London. I can't face it. I'm off,'' wrote Stephen
Pile, an iconoclastic Sunday Times columnist.
   For most Britons, the war years have taken on a burnished,
nostalgic glow, where ``there is never any doubt where the division
between good and evil lies, and where there will always eventually
be a happy ending,'' as Christopher Booker put it in The Daily
Telegraph.
   But although the collective memory is of a nation united, making
huge sacrifices in the noblest of causes, the anniversary is also
reopening old controversies.
   Historians once again are debating whether the pre-war British
government, in seeking to appease Hitler's territorial demands in
Europe, was abjectly craven or playing for time to rearm.
   There is even a debate about whether Britain should have joined
the war.
   That argument was rekindled by Cambridge University historian
Maurice Cowling, who argued in The Sunday Telegraph that from a
purely conservative viewpoint, a victorious Germany would have been
preferable to a postwar Europe dominated by the Soviet Union and the
United States.
   By staying out of the war, he wrote, Britain would have allowed
Hitler to destroy its natural enemy, Bolshevism, and left the
British empire intact.
   ``It is wrong to assume that a dominant Germany would have been
more intolerable to Britain than the Soviet Union was to become, or
that British statesmen had a duty to risk British lives to prevent
Hitler behaving intolerably to Germans and others,'' he wrote.
   Cowling conceded that ``these are harsh judgments which will be
offensive to men of good will,'' and the flood of outraged responses
to the Telegraph proved him right.
   Professor T. E. Allbone, who worked on the development of the
atomic bomb, wrote that had it stayed out, Britain would eventually
have come under the domination of a nuclear-armed Germany.
   Other historians said the empire already was disintegrating
before the war, and Lord Glendevon, a former Tory minister, wrote
that the war saved civilization, ``and I am deeply thankful that I
was old enough to join in.''

   An AP correspondent was able to visit
Afghanistan's second-largest city for 36 hours with the aid of
guerrilla commanders and Afghan army officers. This is her report.

<TEXT>
   Two years of bombardment have made a
ruin of this former royal city named for Alexander the Great, who
may have founded it, but flowers brighten the rubble.
   Roses and mimosa, jasmine and bougainvillea cover the serrated
remains of buildings in Kandahar, which was the seat of Afghan kings
two centuries ago.
   Block after block of mud-walled dwellings that were bombed,
rocketed and shelled by Moslem guerrillas and Afghan soldiers have
been transformed into ghost neighborhoods of jagged walls and
collapsed archways, twisted beams and shattered wooden roofs.
   Other buildings are heavily damaged by bullets and shrapnel. Some
are boarded up and locked.
   What remains, often compared to Beirut, is a monument to the
suffering caused by 11 years of war since the communist coup of
1978, in which Soviet military forces took part for nine years. The
Red Army withdrew in February.
   Even army officers and government officials are half-hearted in
trying to blame the destruction solely on the guerrillas, most of
whose arms are supplied by the United States.
   ``Every day the Soviets were here was a disaster,'' an army
officer said privately. ``All they touched turned to dust. Now that
we are on our own, every day gets a little better.''
   Guerrillas have tried since October 1987 to capture Kandahar,
whose name derives from the Arabic for Alexander.
   The conqueror's army passed through in 329 B.C. For centuries
after that, India and Persia fought over Kandahar, which was
strategically located on the central Asian trade routes.
   Since early May, the government has claimed that guerrillas _
known as the mujahedeen, or holy warriors _ and Pakistani soldiers
were planning a new assault on the city. Kandahar is 70 miles from
Pakistan, where the main guerrilla groups are based.
   Most guerrilla commanders deny the charge, and say instead that
they agreed seven months ago to stop attacks on the city and turn
their rockets and mortars on army posts and on the airport 15 miles
north of the city.
   ``For every communist killed, as many as 100 innocent people may
die'' if the city is shelled, said commander Mulah Naqib of the
fundamentalist Jamiat-i-Islami, or Islamic Society of Afghansitan,
considered the best-organized and most efficient fighting group.
   ``These are the people who helped us against the Russians,'' he
said. ``These are the people who gave us food and protection at a
time when we were getting no outside aid. Why should we kill or hurt
them?''
   Naqib commands about 4,000 of the estimated 20,000 guerrillas
around Kandahar, which was Afghanistan's second-largest city before
the war.
   Only one of the seven often-feuding resistance groups based in
Pakistan _ the fundamenalist Hebz-i-Islami (Party of Islam) led by
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar _ has refused to stop shelling the city, the
field commanders said.
   Some said they may be forced to save some weapons and ammunition
to fight Hekmatyar's men.
   Government officials said the population fell from 300,000 to
about 25,000 when the bombardment was at its heaviest.
   Residents who fled to Pakistan or Iran have begun returning, even
though up to 30 rockets still hit the city every day.
   Lt. Gen. Nurul Haq Ulumi, military governor of Kandahar province,
said: ``Seventy percent of the buildings in the city have been
completely destroyed. The remaining 30 percent have been hit by at
least one bullet.''
   Workers have begun building playgrounds for children and
repairing badly minarets on neighborhood mosques. In the battered
shops of the bazaar, teen-age boys in turbans inspect Japanese-made
electronics goods and women in full-length veils bargain with
vendors for grapes and melons.
   People travel on bicycles and donkeys, on horses sometimes
decorated with silver bells and brightly colored woolen balls, along
paved streets chewed up by tanks.
   Most gasoline stations are closed for lack of supplies, so nearly
all the motor traffic is military.
   ``Two years ago, on any day of the week at any hour of the day,
you couldn't leave your house,'' the army officer said, driving past
rows of shattered government houses. ``This is still war, but it's
just not as bad.''
   Soldiers and guerrillas are within yards of each other in two
rings around the city, but appear to be observing a comparative
truce, at least for a time.
   ``We all want the same thing,'' Ulumi said. He is a member of the
Durrani tribe, which produced the kings of Afghanistan until the
monarch was overthrown in 1973.
   ``The government, the mujahedeen, the refugees in Pakistan, Iran
and the West all want the same thing. We want to live together in
peace,'' he said in an interview at his office in Governor's House,
where portraits of the former kings hang. ``We were friends before
the war. We can be friends in the future.''
   Guerrilla commanders feel, however, that talking with President
Najib is tantamout to accepting the Soviet legacy from a war that
has cost more than 1 million lives.
   ``We have problems with Najib and his government,'' Naqib said.
``They are still the enemy. Maybe we'll see each other and sit down
and talk. God willing, one day we will. But now isn't the right
time.''

   A college football player who admitted
ripping the head off a swan at Western Michigan University received
a 30-day suspended jail sentence Tuesday.
   Kalamazoo District Judge James Coyle also sentenced Paul Johnson,
20, of Rockford, Ill., to two years probation and ordered him to pay
$175 in restitution.
   Johnson pleaded guilty earlier this summer to killing the swan.
   Authorities believe Johnson and teammate Bradley Willis, 19, of
Rossville, Ill., were drunk when they killed the swan April 18.
   Willis pleaded innocent, and faces a jury trial next month.
   University officials banned the students from the football team
until Jan. 1 for destroying university property, and ordered them to
undergo alcohol counseling and to perform 100 hours of community
service at the Kellogg Bird Sanctuary.
   Killing a protected waterfowl is a misdemeanor punishable by up
to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Authorities estimated bird's
value at $350.

   The Environmental Protection Agency will press on
with an effort to kill Denver's proposed $500 million Two Forks dam
because of the damage it would cause to the environment, an EPA
official said Tuesday.
   The 615-foot-high dam to be built near the confluence of the
South Platte River and its North Fork would flood 30 miles of scenic
river valley and canyon and the town of Deckers to provide drinking
water for up to 360,000 new Denver-area residents.
   Opponents, including several environmental groups, have called
the project ``the biggest ecological disaster'' in Colorado history.
   ``The Two Forks dam and reservoir project would result in the
loss of a major aquatic resource which provides irreplaceable stream
fishery habitat and recreational resources near the Denver
metropolitan area,'' said Lee DeHihns, the EPA deputy regional
administrator from Atlanta who reviewed the project for five months.
   DeHihns said he was recommending continuation of the veto process
started by EPA administrator William Reilly on March 24. The next
step in the process is two months of public hearings. The final
decision will be made at EPA headquarters in Washington, but DeHihns
said vetoes are rarely overturned.
   ``I caution that there are still powerful forces aligned against
us,'' Two Forks opponent Sen. Jim Exon, D-Neb., said in a statement
released by his Washington office.
   ``You simply can't leave us high and dry,'' Mayor Federico Pena
said at a news conference Tuesday. ``We have not been given a fair,
objective appraisal of this project.''
   DeHihns said in response to Pena's remarks: ``I'm not happy
they're upset. But I'm obliged to carry out my responsibilities
under the law.''
   Gov. Roy Romer, a onetime Two Forks supporter, was noncommittal
about DeHihns' decision. He said he hoped the cooperation forged
between Denver and its suburbs in their drive to build the project
would not deteriorate.
   EPA officials said DeHihns had two options besides continuing the
veto process _ letting the project proceed or attaching additional
environmental requirements that would have to be met before the
project could proceed.
   But after more than 160 hours of meetings with Two Forks backers
and foes, DeHihns' apparently remained unconvinced the project could
be built without inflicting serious environmental damage.
   The dam 25 miles southwest of Denver was proposed by the Denver
Water Board and 42 area water providers. They said the dam is needed
to meet Denver's future water needs.
   DeHihns said metropolitan Denver appears to have adequate water
supplies for now, and could put more water conservation measures in
place.
   ``This is not just a statement to the people of Denver,'' said
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``We should hear this message too.''
   Environmental groups said the dam would flood a premier trout
stream and dry up wildlife habitat in Nebraska. Nebraska Gov. Kay
Orr opposes the project.
   Denver Water Board spokesman Ed Ruetz denied the downstream
habitat would dry up if the dam were built.
   Another board member, Monte Pascoe, said the agency would
challenge DeHihns' decision and demand more EPA involvement in
future Denver water decisions.
   Audubon Society President Peter A.A. Berle said DeHihns deserves
``the heartfelt praise and gratitude of all concerned Americans''
because of his decision.
   ``This recommendation brings us one step closer to a total
victory for common sense and for the environment,'' said Melinda
Kassen of the Environmental Defense Fund. ``There are less costly
and less destructive ways to supply the Denver metropolitan area
with water.''

<HEAD>After Thursday, United States Will Have No One to Recognize in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. policy toward Panama enters an uncertain
phase Friday when the calendar runs out on the ousted president's
term, leaving the United States with nobody to recognize as legal
head of the country.
   The situation raises a number of touchy situations, such as
notifying Panamanian officials when a U.S. naval vessel plans to
search a Panamanian-flag ship suspected of carrying drugs.
   Panama's President Eric Arturo Delvalle was ousted in February
1988 by forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The Reagan
administration refused to recognize that ouster, and the United
States has continued to look upon Delvalle as Panama's legal
authority even though he wields no power.
   But Friday is the date when Delvalle was supposed to step down
officially as president, according to Panama's constitution. With
that date, the Bush administration's withdraws the mantle of
legitimacy it accorded to Delvalle.
   In the absence of even a paper successor, the United States will
not have anyone it recognizes as president of Panama.
   The end of Delvalle's term also means that his envoy in
Washington, Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, will surrender control of the
Panamanian Embassy here. The building will remain under the State
Department's care until a democratically elected government taks
office in Panama.
   Sosa has found an apartment here and plans to look for a job.
   Officials acknowledge they don't know what will happen in cases
such as those involving the inspection of Panamanian ships.
   For the past 18 months, U.S. naval vessels encountering
Panamanian-flag ships suspected of carrying illicit narcotics have
secured permission from Delvalle before inspecting these vessels.
   It is normal for the United States to recognize whatever
authority is in effective control in a foreign country, but an
exception was made in the case of Panama because of Washington's
refusal to have official dealings with the Noriega-dominated
government in Panama.
   The campaign against Noriega began in earnest after two Florida
grand juries indicted him on drug-smuggling charges in February 1988.
   In practical terms, the end of Delvalle's term in office will
mean little. Having spent much of the time since his ouster living
in hiding in Panama with only a small base of popular support,
Delvalle has been largely irrelevant as a political factor since he
was deposed.
   His downfall occurred when he attempted to fire Noriega as
commander of Panama's military forces. Within hours, the
Noriega-controlled National Assembly voted to fire him as president
and to replace him with Manuel Solis Palma, a Noriega loyalist.
   After Friday, it is not clear what will happen in Panama.
Authorities there recognize the constitutional significance of that
date but there is no officially recognized successor to Solis Palma
because the May 7 national election results were voided by the
government after the anti-Noriega candidate, Guillermo Endara,
appeared to have won by a wide margin.
   The Bush administration recognizes Endara as ``president-elect''
but officials said unless there is a swearing-in accompanied by the
appointment of a cabinet, the United States has no one to recognize.
   The administration had hoped the Organization of American States
would be able to promote a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
But that effort broke down last week, and Noriega seems to have
emerged with his power intact.
   U.S. officials said afterward the administration may tighten
economic sanctions which were imposed against Panama last year after
Delvalle's ouster.

<HEAD>FDA Moves to Pull Dyazide Clone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is moving to
withdraw from the market the second of two generic versions of a
popular drug used to treat high blood pressure.
   However, the company that makes the drug contends that it's safe
and effective.
   In the third such action in less than a week, the FDA proposed
Monday to remove Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc.'s generic version of
Dyazide because of questions about its therapeutic value.
   The Copiague, N.Y.-based company said in a statement that its
product remains on the market.
   ``It is safe, effective and may be used with assurance of
clinical effectiveness,'' Bolar said, adding that it will appeal the
FDA action within the 30-day limit.
   Dyazide and its generic competitors are among the most widely
prescribed drugs in the country and the generic version is Bolar's
largest-selling product.
   The FDA said it ``has not been able to fully establish'' whether
Bolar's product has the same effect as the brand-name product made
by SmithKline Beecham PLC.
   Bolar officials told The Washington Post in today's editions that
the FDA announcement is the result of confusion over a clerical
error in the identification of samples used in safety testing and
misinterpretation of the results of tests for safety and
effectiveness conducted by the company last year.
   The FDA said that while the proceeding to withdraw approval of
the company's license to market its product is under way, it will
indicate that the drug is not considered to be of proved therapeutic
equivalence to the brand-name drug.
   If Bolar's generic Dyazide is withdrawn, there would be no
generic version on the market. Generics are copies of brand-name
drugs that sell for much lower prices.
   The other maker of a generic Dyazide, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals
Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., halted distribution of its copy
earlier this summer when the company said it substituted samples of
the brand-name drug in tests required for FDA approval.
   Bolar is among 11 drug makers being investigated by the FDA in
the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption involving employees
in the agency's generic drug division and some makers of generic
drugs.
   The agency also is sampling 30 of the most prescribed generic
drugs and their brand-name counterparts in the wake of disclosure
that several generic drug companies have provided false data to the
FDA.
   However, the FDA said it found no evidence of fraud in the
approval process for Bolar's generic Dyazide.
   Questions about the product's equivalence to the brand-name
product stem from irregularities in the batch records for lots of
the product that were tested, the agency said.
   The FDA announced last week it was proposing to withdraw
approvals for three products made by Par Pharmaceuticals of Spring
Valley, N.Y., and 25 made by Vitarine.
   The FDA's action was praised by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee, which has been looking into the agency's generic drug
division.
   ``The FDA is coming to grips with the problems in the generic
drug industry,'' he said. ``I expect that after all is said and done
both the FDA and the generic industry will be stronger and better.''

   A man burst into a birthday party and opened
fire with a gun, killing his estranged wife and three other women
while seriously wounding two other people, authorities said Monday.
   Raymundo Navarro Jr. was arrested without resistance outside his
father's apartment, authorities and witnesses said. He was held
without bail for investigation of murder and of attempted murder.
   Maria Delia Navarro was celebrating her 27th birthday with about
20 family members and friends late Sunday when her estranged husband
burst in and began shooting a handgun, investigators said.
   Maria fell dead, as did Maria Garcia, 65, Leticia M. Dipp, 46,
and Francisca Arizpe, 62, said coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher.
   ``I hid behind a cabinet when the man came in and started
shooting,'' said 12-year-old Francisco Amazcua. ``I saw people fall
to the floor. After he left, I ran into the bedroom and hid under
the bed with two other kids.''
   An unidentified woman was listed in critical condition at
County-USC Medical Center with gunshot wounds to the head, and a man
with a bullet wound in the abdomen was in serious condition, Los
Angeles County sheriff's investigators said.
   Partygoer Jesus Amezcua said someone telephoned Maria's apartment
about 11 p.m. Sunday to warn partygoers that Navarro, 26, was on his
way. Maria telephoned the 911 emergency line and said her husband
was coming to kill her, he said.
   The 911 operator told Maria to call back when Navarro arrived,
the partygoer said. Minutes later, Navarro invaded the party
carrying a gun, said Amezcua.
   The Sheriff's Department confirmed someone called the East Los
Angeles station prior to the shooting, but said it was unable to
give details about the conversation until the tape is located and
transcribed.
   ``He had a very bad temper. They used to fight a lot,'' said
Beatrice Palacios, 27, a longtime friend of the couple.
   The couple separated for about a year and Navarro has been
despondent about the breakup, friends said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities are mixed, with rates on three-month bills declining
slightly while rates on six-month bills are at their highest level
since mid-June.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.94 percent, down from 7.99
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.88 percent, up from 7.85 percent
last week.
   The rates on three-month bills matched the rates Aug. 7 and were
the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.65 percent on July 31.
The rates on six-month bills were the highest since June 19 when
they averaged 8.08 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.21 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,799.30 and 8.32 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,601.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 8.36
percent last week, up from 8.30 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Federal Job Turnover Rate is 9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 9 percent turnover rate among federal
employees in 1987 is roughly comparable to private industry and may
be about right for an employer as large as the government, says the
Merit Systems Protection Board.
   The board said Monday that it found a 5 percent turnover rate for
many technical and engineering occupations such as computer
specialists. That was ``contrary to conventional wisdom'' that
turnover problems are more severe in those categories than other job
descriptions, the board said.
   The board said its figures were virtually identical to those in a
1984 study by the Congressional Budget Office and not far off the
private sector turnover rates of 14 percent and 16 percent cited in
two recent studies.
   After major differences are filtered out, ``federal employee
turnover may not be as different from private sector turnover as
believed by some,'' it said.
   One difference, for example, is that a private worker who moves
from one company to another would count as a ``turnover,'' while a
federal worker transfering from one department to another would not.
   Calling the overall government turnover rate ``relatively
stable,'' the board said ``the current overall rate of turnover may
be near optimal for an organization the size of the federal
government.''
   Of those leaving, 58 percent resigned, 25 percent retired, 5
percent were fired and 12 percent were unspecified ``other
removals,'' the report said.
   The board based its report on an analysis of 1.4 million employee
records from the 1987 fiscal year.
   Here are some highlights of the report:
   _There was a 25 percent turnover rate among employees during
their first year of service.
   _Only 4 percent of all employees with from 16 to 20 years of
service left their jobs during the year reviewed.
   _Among those with more than 30 years' service, 20 percent retired
in 1987.
   _The average age of federal retirees, 60, is close to the average
age of private sector retirees, which is about 61 to 62.
   _Although they constitute only 26 percent of the work force,
employees in the lowest five pay grades accounted for 55 percent of
all resignations.
   _Turnover was highest among health-related and lower-level
clerical and support occupations _ 19 percent of all practical
nurses and 16 percent of all clerk-typists.

<HEAD>Official Says Timetable For Nuclear Waste Dump Depends on Nevada</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department may be unable to set a
reliable date for completing a high-level nuclear waste dump in
Nevada until it wins state permission to begin site studies, a
senior department official says.
   In an interview Monday, Samuel Rousso indicated that squabbles
with Nevada pose a bigger obstacle than a court ruling last week
against the department's proposed $1 billion contract award to a
Bechtel Corp. unit to manage the waste repository.
   Rousso, acting director of the department's Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management, said no decision has been made on
whether to appeal the court ruling.
   Completion of the dump proposed for Yucca Mountain, about 100
miles northwest of Las Vegas, originally was scheduled for 1998 and
currently is set for 2003. The Nevada state government and its
congressional delegation oppose the project, in part on grounds that
Nevada was chosen for political reasons rather than scientific
reasons.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said earlier this summer he was
reconsidering the project timetable in light of recent setbacks, and
Rousso said he expects a decision in the next few months on whether
the schedule will be pushed back again.
   ``A meaningful schedule will probably depend on agreement with
the state to go forward,'' Rousso said. ``At some point _ there's no
fixed point, but at some point _ we must have access'' to the site
to perform the preliminary work.
   Nevada so far has refused to grant the environmental permits
needed by the Energy Department to begin drilling on the site to
determine its geologic suitability. The department is obligated by a
1982 federal law to study the Yucca Mountain site.
   Gov. Bob Miller cited last week's court ruling against the
contract award to Bechtel as an example of the program's lack of
credibility.
   U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson ruled on Thursday that
the department may award the contract to no one but TRW
Environmental Safety Systems Inc. TRW was an unsuccessful bidder
which sued on grounds that the department's means of selecting
Bechtel Systems Management Inc. as manager was improper and unfair.
   ``Over the short run, I can't see that that's a dramatic impact''
on the program, said Rousso, unless it forces the department to
abandon its plans to put a single company _ Bechtel or any other _
in charge of managing much of the project.
   Nuclear utilities are eager to see the repository built because
some are being forced to spend millions of dollars to expand
temporary waste storage facilities. Utilities customers pay $400
million a year into a fund for the permanent dump.
   Rousso also reiterated his denial of one of TRW's main charges:
that his involvement in the contract award process was a conflict of
interest. TRW asserted that the award was tainted by the fact that
Rousso worked for Science Applications International Corp., a
Bechtel subcontractor, before joining the Energy Department.
   Rousso said he worked for Science Applications for seven months
before joining the department in 1986. The Yucca Mountain contract
proposal did not exist then, he said, adding that he has no
continuing ties with Science Applications.
   ``I hold no pension rights, no favoritism, no job promises, no
thoughts to that regard, and I don't see where any conflict of
interest has been shown,'' he said.

   Security for Gov. Bob Martinez has been
bolstered amid threats of political violence by Colombian drug
lords, the governor confirmed Monday.
   ``There has been a general warning, a general concern of
high-profile public officials on the subject of drugs,'' Martinez
told reporters. ``We've been rather active in dealing with the drug
issue.''
   The additional protection started this weekend after FDLE agents
were told by federal sources that Colombian drug lords threatened a
political assassination in the U.S. if any of the targeted drug
dealers were extradited from Colombia, Martinez said.
   Earlier this year, Martinez traveled to Colombia and other Latin
American countries to survey drug-fighting efforts. He also serves
as the National Governors' Association lead governor on substance
abuse and drug trafficking.
   Last Friday, the governor asked U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh to extradite 25 Florida drug fugitives should they be
arrested by Colombian authorities.
   Martinez said he believed American officials might be threatened
because of the scheduled extradition Wednesday of a Colombian drug
dealer.
   ``The Florida Department of Law Enforcement just feels a little
bit more comfortable, at least in these next few days, being a
little more cautious,'' the governor said.
   Brian Ballard, director of operations for Martinez, said the
governor's public schedule, which is normally published days in
advance for distribution to the press, will now be on a day-to-day
basis.

   Voyager's pictures of Neptune's moon
Triton _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have
been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the
spacecraft's cameras, NASA says.
   ``It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said Rich Terrile,
an astronomer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It would have been an incredible
disappointment.''
   ``They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone said Monday.
   Meanwhile, scientists said the spacecraft found that Triton is
the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, and that Neptune
has something in common with Los Angeles: smog.
   Only days before Voyager made its closest approach to Neptune
last Thursday and zipped past Triton on Friday, scientists
recognized that the frosty surface of Neptune's largest moon
reflected much more light than originally expected, said Mary Beth
Murrill, a JPL spokeswoman.
   Engineers compensated by sending Voyager new computer commands
reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 6.68
seconds to 3.84 seconds for the best close-ups of Triton, Murrill
said.
   Those photographs revealed that giant craters, called calderas,
once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square
miles of lunar terrain. They also found what scientists believe are
active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen
particles 20 miles skyward.
   During its Neptune encounter, Voyager's cameras discovered six
moons in addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from
Earth. They also found three thin rings of debris and five broad
rings encircling the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   NASA engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said Lanny Miller, manager of the flight
engineering office.
   By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 4.55 million miles behind Neptune, speeding toward the
edge of the solar system at 37,568 mph.
   Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined Triton's surface
temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon
``the coldest body we have seen in the solar system,'' said Roger
Yelle of the University of Arizona.
   Scientists believe Pluto and its moon Charon are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   Voyager also found smog on Neptune.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in the planet's
atmosphere converts it into a 90-mile-thick icy layer of
photochemical smog at the bottom of Neptune's stratosphere, said Jim
Pollock, an imaging team member from NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif.
   ``Photochemical smog exists any place we've been that has an
atmosphere,'' imaging team leader Bradford Smith said of other
planets and moons.
   ``In Los Angeles, the problem is it's happening way down low
where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything we've seen
except on Titan,'' he said, referring to Saturn's smoggy moon.
   In another finding, the best close-up shot of the Neptunian moon
1989 N1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its
lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide surface.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1,
one of the six moons discovered by Voyager since June, Smith said.
   Voyager found earlier that 1989 N1 really is Neptune's
second-largest moon after Triton. Scientists previously thought
Nereid was No. 2.
   Instruments aboard Voyager discovered Neptune is encircled by
electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape,
called a torus.
   The torus is created by gases coming off of Triton, said Ralph
McNutt, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jupiter is
orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur
volcanoes on the Jovian moon Io.
   The space probe also found Neptune and Triton have auroras
vaguely like Earth's northern and southern lights. They glow in
ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye, however,
unlike Earth's visible auroras.
   Voyager's close encounter with Neptune last week capped its epic
tour of the four outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus. The probe was launched in 1977 along with its twin, Voyager
1, which explored only Jupiter and Saturn.

   Aladdin Touran, a senior official of the People's Mojahedin
Organization of Iran, was arrested Aug. 21 at Los Angeles
International Airport by agents of the FBI, the State Department and
other federal agencies, FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said.
   Touran, a member of the Mojahedin's international relations
department, was wanted for allegedly entering the United States in
August 1988 with a fraudulent visa at Dulles International Airport
outside Washington, D.C., Reagan said.
   The charge was contained in a complaint issued by the Eastern
District U.S. Attorney's Office in Virginia.
   A spokesman for the Mojahedin condemned the arrest of a top
leader the organization says is under a death sentence issued in
absentia by the Iranian government. Ali Reza Jafarzadeh said the
arrest was an effort by the Bush administration to improve relations
with Iran in its attempts to win release of American hostages held
by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   The opposition group has engaged in combat with the Iranian
regime, even taking up arms in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Touran, 33, was being held without bail Monday at the federal
Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney's
spokeswoman Grace Denton said.
   U.S. Magistrate Ralph Geffen scheduled an identification hearing
for Touran for Sept. 6, Ms. Denton said. Touran probably would be
extradited to Virginia to face the charge if he doesn't enter a plea
in Los Angeles, she said.
   Touran was arrested as he stepped off a Scandinavian Airlines
flight from Copenhagen, Reagan said. Touran was carrying Swedish
travel documents issued in the name of Noori-Elika, said Claes
Jernaeus, press attache to the Swedish consulate in Los Angeles.
   Touran used the name Noori-Elika for security purposes, fearing
retribution from the Iranian regime, Jefarzadeh said. He also said
Touran's use of the other name when travelling was well-known by
European and American officials.
   Jefarzadeh said Touran had a Swedish politica refugee passport
and lived in Stockholm. He said Touran had come to Los Angeles to
meet with other members of the Mojahedin when he was arrested.

   A teacher was fatally stabbed Monday
outside her elementary school classroom on the city's southeast
side, police said.
   The 24-year-old teacher's name was being withheld pending
notification of her relatives, said Sgt. Billy Samuels. He said the
beginning teacher at Glen Park Elementary School had been stabbed
several times in the face and neck.
   ``It was pretty vicious,'' Samuels said.
   The woman apparently was attacked while moving school supplies to
her classroom, police said. Officers had no motive or suspect in the
killing. The woman's purse and car had not been taken and it did not
appear she had been sexually assaulted.
   Another teacher found the woman lying on steps outside her
classroom door about 12:40 p.m., Samuels said. No students were in
the school. The teachers had been preparing for fall classes to
start.
   The victim was pronounced dead about 2 p.m. at John Peter Smith
Hospital, Samuels said.

<HEAD>U.S. Continues to be Top Importer of Oats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign producers are seeing some of the bloom
fade from the lucrative U.S. oats market as American farmers rebound
from last year's drought, according to an Agriculture Department
report.
   The United States has been the world's largest importer of oats
since 1983-84, including a spectacular increase the last two or
three years as consumers discovered the grain's health benefits.
   ``Research has linked the fiber content of oats with lower serum
cholesterol levels, and health concerns have buoyed the demand for
oat food products,'' the report said.
   In the 1988-89 marketing year that ended May 31, U.S. oats
imports rose to about 68 million bushels, or nearly 1 million metric
tons, a 50 percent increase from 1987-88.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 68.9 bushels
of oats. A bushel of oats weights 32 pounds, little more than half
that of wheat.
   Oats imports in 1989-90 are forecast to settle back to around 50
million bushels, or about 725,000 tons, but the United States is
expected to remain as the dominant buyer in the world market, the
report said.
   The USDA estimates that food use of oats in 1988-89 jumped more
than 40 percent from the previous year, but that the amount of oats
used as livestock feed has been declining because of its relative
high price relative to corn.
   Oats production this year is expected to rise 74 percent from the
drought-stricken 1988 harvest to 381 million bushels, or about 5.53
million tons, according to USDA forecasts.
   ``This likely will mean season average farm prices 25 percent to
40 percent below last year,'' the report said. ``Imports are
expected to drop 25 percent ... (but) at this level, U.S. imports
would still account for about half the volume of world trade
forecast to 1989-90.''
   The report, published in the September issue of Agricultural
Outlook, said ``no significant increases'' in oats imports by other
countries are expected.
   ``While interest in the health qualities of oats may be growing
in other countries, this has not yet translated into significantly
higher import demand for food-quality oats,'' the report said.
   Economist Pete Riley said in his report that global export
supplies of oats in 1989-90 ``are expected to be adequate to meet
U.S. demand'' and that even if market prices drop significantly the
major suppliers ``are likely to continue producing for the U.S.''
market.
   Canada and Sweden have been the biggest suppliers since the U.S.
oats boom began, but Argentina and Finland also are providers. Some
oats were bought from Poland last year, after Finland turned out a
poor harvest.
   Riley said that even if U.S. production turns out as forecast,
the proportion of top quality oats is not assured and that ``a
shortage of high-quality oats suitable for milling count still push
imports higher than currently expected.''
   The USDA says oats prices nationally may average in the range of
$1.55 to $1.95 per bushel in 1989-90, compared with $2.61 estimated
for 1988-89.

   Have plenty of calling cards, don't be pushy,
and be sure to handle liquor well. That's part of the secret of
doing business in South Korea, says a trade consultant.
   Song-Hyon Jang, president of S.H. Jang and Associates Inc. in
Seoul, said it pays for an American exporter to learn about his
country's culture, national priorities and business customs.
   ``The exchange of calling cards is very important,'' he writes in
the current issue of AgExporter magazine published by the
Agriculture Department.
   ``In Korea, every person has a distinct place in the
organizational hierarchy. Consequently, Korean business people want
to know right away what position you hold in your company.''
   South Korea, with its 40 million people, is a prime buyer of U.S.
farm products, ranking No. 2 last year with purchases totaling $2.3
billion. Japan was the No. 1 single-country buyer at $7.3 billion.
   ``Don't try to push your position too hard,'' he said.
``Sensitive issues and details may be skipped for future
discussions, either by a go-between or by your staff, if available.''
   The use of go-betweens can be valuable in ``delicate dealings''
involving money, Jang said.
   ``Never cause Koreans to lose face by putting them in a difficult
position,'' he said. ``On the contrary, find something to praise,
such as their country's recently earned prosperity.''
   Jang said entertainment is an important part of trade
relationships and, when offered, should always be accepted. In due
time, it should be reciprocated in some way.
   ``Korean parties are often like drinking competitions,'' he said.
``A capacity for alcohol consumption may be one of the deciding
factors in a successful business negotiation and relationship. The
giving of small gifts is also an accepted practice and is
recommended.''

   Broiler exports in the first five months of
this year totaled 376 million pounds, up nearly 30 percent from a
year earlier, says the Agriculture Department.
   A report by the department's Economic Research Service said
broiler parts made up 95 percent of the shipments. Lower-priced
parts, mainly legs and other dark meat parts, helped boost sales in
major Pacific markets.

<HEAD>Jailed Mexican Cult Member Has AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mexican cult member who is accused of gory
human sacrifices is suffering from AIDS, a defense attorney and the
state news agency Notimex said.
   Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, 23, has acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, Notimex said Monday.
   Judicial officials confirmed Orea had been tranferred to a prison
hospital but refused to disclose his illness.
   ``He has AIDS,'' defense attorney Horacio Moyar Quintanilla said
in a telephone interview. ``That's what the doctors told me.''
   Moyar Quintanilla represents the woman prosecutors say was the
cult's ``godmother'' _ Sara Maria Aldrete Villareal.
   The lawyer said doctors' reports show Ms. Aldrete, 24, does not
have the fatal disease though she and Orea Ochoa both were lovers of
cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, who died in a May 6 shootout
with police in Mexico City.
   Several other cult members also were lovers of the 26-year-old
Constanzo, according to court testimony.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a usually fatal disease in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers.
   Cult members had been on the run since the April discovery of 15
mutilated bodies on a ranch near Matamoros, across the border from
Brownsville, Texas. Among the victims was Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old
University of Texas student who cult members say was sacrificed in a
ritual to provide protection for their drug-smuggling business.
   Orea Ochoa and Ms. Aldrete claim to know nothing about the
killings. They face homicide charges.

<HEAD>Cities Say Funds Lacking in Aid to Children</HEAD>

   Officials of U.S. cities say they need ``real
commitments'' from the federal government to deal with problems
affecting children, including child care, drugs and teen-age
pregnancy.
   ``We need help, and we need it now,'' said James P. Moran Jr.,
mayor of Alexandria, Va., and a member of the National League of
Cities.
   ``We also need real commitments over the long run, not the kind
of federal aid that is here one year and gone the next.''
   The League released a 390-city survey Monday that found officials
in nine of 10 cities regard child care as the most pressing need
among children's issues.
   ``This report is a sobering slap of reality that should awaken
our national conscience,'' said Moran, chairman of the League's
human development policy committee.
   In cities between 50,000 and 100,000 population, alcohol and
drugs were rated as the second most pressing issue, named by 48
percent of those questioned.
   Education, especially dropout prevention, and health were second
among cities between 100,000 and 300,000 population, with 41 percent
of those responding mentioning each.
   In larger cities, however, the prevention of teen-age pregnancy
became the second most serious problem, cited by 43 percent.
   Nearly half of the cities under 300,000 and 70 percent of the
larger cities said lack of money was the chief barrier to dealing
with such problems.
   Some cities, the report said, already are taking steps to deal
with the problems:
   _Jacksonville, Fla., in cooperation with Barnett Bank and the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitiative Services, developed a
program to train mothers on welfare to operate family day-care homes.
   _In Spokane, Wash., a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Task Force has
sponsored an annual conference for teens on sexuality and is working
on a community action plan.
   _Boise, Idaho, funds 10 apartments and places homeless families
with children in them for up to two months rent-free.
   _In Oakland, Calif., an advisory council of children and adults
advises the City Council on young people's issues.
   ``From coast to coast, cities are working on these issues in
innovative ways,'' the report said. ``They predict their involvement
will increase over time _ except there is no money to support
expansion.''
   One city out of four is significantly involved in child care and,
the report said, that is expected to increase to one in three during
the 1990s.
   The study covered 278 cities with populations above 50,000, and
112 smaller cities.
   Moran said the survey of larger cities, covering 60 percent of
all those in the nation, was much broader than that for the smaller
communities.
   ``Most of the findings run parallel for the smaller cities and
can be regarded as generally good indicators,'' he said.

   Eager music fans snapped up tens of thousands
of tickets in an hour for former Beatle Paul McCartney's first
concert appearances in Los Angeles in 13 years.
   Three shows at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood sold out
within 29 minutes after tickets went on sale at $28.50 each at 9
a.m. Monday, said Laura Gold, publicity director for tour co-sponsor
Parc Promotions, Inc.
   Organizers decided to add two more shows, and tickets for those
were gone by 10 a.m., Ms. Gold said. Organizers expect a crowd of
15,500 people at each of the shows.
   The concerts in late November will kick off McCartney's first
North American tour since he appeared with his band Wings in the
``Wings Over America'' tour in 1976, Ms. Gold said.
   Other tour stops this year include Chicago, Toronto, Montreal and
New York. More U.S. cities will be added for next year, she said.

   Unlike other aging rockers who have gone back on
the road, the Jefferson Airplane isn't doing it for the money, lead
singer Grace Slick says.
   ``The Who and the Rolling Stones figure, `I want another wing on
my villa,' so they go and tour,'' Slick said. ``We go on the road
because the guys just like to play.''
   The band that formed in 1965 and pioneered the psychedelic rock
scene in San Francisco plays in New York's Radio City Music Hall
tonight and Wednesday night. The group plans to release its first
album in 17 years next week.
   Slick said she enjoyed the 1960s drug scene, but she said she is
thankful to the police for helping her get off drugs and alcohol.
   ``The highway patrol finally said, `Look, if you don't stop
driving 150 miles an hour we're going to take your license away,'''
she said, adding that she took their advice because she is
``probably still more addicted to cars than drugs.''
   ``I never thought in my wildest dreams when I was a kid that I'd
thank the highway patrol for being alive,'' she said.

   What do Oprah Winfrey and Ann-Margaret have in
common? They're both on the cover of the latest issue of TV Guide,
and neither is pleased.
   Appearing under the headline ``Oprah! The Richest Woman on TV?''
the magazine's cover illustration has the talk-show host's face
superimposed on the actress' hourglass figure.
   The cover, which appears to show Miss Winfrey in a gauzy dress
atop a pile of money, is not identified as a composite. TV Guide
acknowledged Monday that unsuspecting readers might think it's a
real photograph.
   The lean body came from a publicity shot of Ann-Margret for a
``Rockette'' special she did about 10 years ago, according to her
publicist, George Kirvay. ``I think she was shocked,'' Kirvay said.
``If you look at the two pictures, they're identical. It's even her
ring on Oprah's hand.''
   The formerly overweight Miss Winfrey, who lost 67 pounds on a
diet in 1988, had no part in the cover's making, said Christine
Tardio, a spokeswoman for Miss Winfrey's Harpo production company.
   ``Oprah would not pose on a pile of money like that nor would she
pose in that revealing a dress,'' she said.
   ``Ann-Margret should be thrilled because she's got another TV
Guide cover,'' said David Sendler, the magazine's national section
editor. ``And Oprah should be thrilled because she looks terrific.''
   But Sendler said TV Guide had instructed the artist who did the
illustration ``not to use photographs so literally'' in the future.

   He has agreed to appear on the cover of the September issue of

   ``The whole thing about rock 'n' roll is to put on this fake

Michaels said.
   ``That image is part of me and speaking about diabetes is part of
me. I don't separate the two.''
   In the magazine interview, Michaels said he tests his blood sugar
six to 10 times a day because of his erratic sleeping and eating
schedule.
   The magazine, which has an estimated circulation of 250,000, has
featured other diabetic performers on its cover, including jazz

<HEAD>Robbers Steal More Than Ton of Silver From Remote Nevada Mine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two shotgun-toting robbers stole more than a
ton of unprocessed silver from a remote mine in a caper so well
planned that authorities suspect they had inside information.
   Baffled authorities said Monday they had no solid leads or
suspects in the robbery late Saturday night at Trinity Silver Mine,
in Lovelock about 90 miles northeast of Reno.
   The impure silver was worth more than $200,000, authorities said.
   Gene Smith, spokesman for Los Angeles-based U.S. Borax Co., which
owns part of the mine, said the robbers carted off the loot using a
wheelbarrow and truck and then left spikes in the road to flatten
tires of any pursuers.
   ``It was well planned, that's for sure,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``They knew what they were doing.''
   A man wearing a red ski mask and armed with a .12-gauge shotgun
confronted two mine employees, tied them with duct tape and then
loaded up 1.25 tons of silver buttons, wheelbarrow by wheelbarrow,
onto a pickup truck outside, Pershing County Undersheriff Bill Davis
said.
   The robber was about 6-foot-4 and his accomplice was either a
small man or a woman, Davis said.
   The robbery was discovered when the next mining shift came in
Sunday morning, police said. The bound employees weren't injured.
   Authorities speculated the robbers would try to melt down the
unmarked silver buttons, which are the size of Hershey kisses. Davis
said police have notified precious metals dealers about the theft.
   Smith said the tires of mining company employees' cars were
flattened by spikes in the road when they drove to Lovelock to
report the theft Sunday morning.
   It took the robbers more than one hour to load up the booty that
was in a locked vault and was scheduled to be shipped out of
Lovelock soon, according to Smith, who said the thieves apparently
broke the lock.
   Smith said the mine normally waits until it has about 50,000
ounces of dore, or unpure silver, before it ships a load for further
processing. The robbers got away with 40,000 ounces.

<HEAD>US Trade Deficit Cut With Industrialized Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States cut its trade deficit with
Western Europe, Japan and industrialized countries of the Far East
in the first half of 1989, but increased its deficit with Third
World countries.
   That's the kind of development many economists have been urging,
saying the United States buys too much from advanced industrial
countries and sells them too little.
   Poorer nations want to expand their sales in the United States
and cut imports.
   If the second half of the year is like the first, the deficit
with Western Europe will be only $4.5 billion, compared with $15.8
billion last year, according to a Commerce Department report
released Monday. No breakdown was given for individual European
countries.
   With the four industrialized areas of the Far East known as the
``four tigers'' _ Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan _ the
decrease in the deficit would be $6.5 billion, to $22.7 billion.
Those countries have allowed the value of their currencies to rise,
making their goods less attractive in the United States and
encouraging exports.
   The projected drop in the deficit with Japan, however, is only
$1.8 billion, leaving its deficit at $50.9 billion.
   Some economists think the trend won't continue.
   ``This is the end of the good news in trade,'' said Michael
Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company.
   David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill said the growth of exports had
slowed with the rise of the price of the dollar over the past 18
months. The increased cost of the dollar in terms of yen and marks,
for example, should make American goods less attractive to Japanese
and West Germans.
   The changes in the projected balance are due to exports,
increasing at a rate of 15 percent to Western Europe, 14 percent to
Japan and 7 percent to the four tigers.
   U.S. deficits were increasing at a rate of $7 billion with OPEC
countries, $1 billion with China and $200 million with Mexico.
   U.S. sales of farm goods were growing more rapidly _ 13 percent _
than minerals and manufactured products _ 12 percent. There was a 24
percent surge in imports of petroleum, which is coming in at the
fastest rate since 1985 and at higher prices.
   Other kinds of imports increased more slowly, though Mexican
sales showed a strong increase of 14 percent to a rate of $2.9
billion. From Japan, the increased rate was only 4 percent, and 6
percent from Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
   In the second quarter, March through June, U.S. farm exports were
almost unchanged from the first quarter. Drops in sales of wheat to
the Soviet Union, soybeans to Western Europe and tobacco to Japan
were offset by increased sales of feed grains to South Korea and
Taiwan.
   Other kinds of exports increased by 4 percent, led by chemicals
and aircraft to Western Europe.
   Imports of passenger cars dropped sharply in the quarter _ 37
percent from West Germany and 9 percent from Japan. However, U.S.
manufacturers increased production in Mexico, which sent 31 percent
more vehicles across the border.

   The State Department is opposing Palestine
Liberation Organization membership in a world tourism group.
   It was not clear, however, that U.S. opposition would derail the
move being discussed at a meeting of the World Tourism Organization
in Paris because the United States doesn't have veto power.
   The Bush administration could discourage the move by withholding
financial support. The United States, which covers 4 percent to 5
percent of the organization's budget, is contributing $330,000 this
year.
   The PLO applied for membership July 7 for ``Palestine.''
   ``In our view, the self-declared state of Palestine, which we do
not recognize, does not meet the generally accepted criteria under
international law for statehood, and thus does not qualify for
membership in international organizations,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.

   A federal judge says the government may narrow
a conspiracy charge in the Iran-Contra indictment against former
national security adviser John Poindexter.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene agreed Monday to drop
allegations of conspiracy by Poindexter and others to illegally
divert funds to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels from the Reagan
administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh had sought to abandon portions
of the conspiracy charge to avoid problems relating to the
disclosure of classified information.
   Remaining in the indictment are allegations that Poindexter
conspired to obstruct Congress, make false statements and destroy
official documents in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   His alleged co-conspirators were former White House aide Oliver
North and businessmen Richard Secord and Albert Hakim. Prosecutors
say North enlisted Secord's help in running arms to the Contras
during a congressional ban in military aid to the Nicaraguan rebel
force.
   Poindexter also is charged with two counts of obstruction of

<NOTE>Consumer Commission Announces Toy Recalls</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toys ``R'' Us Inc. is voluntarily recalling
9,600 ``Siren Whistle'' toys because young children might choke on
them, the Consumer Product Safety Commission says.
   The commission said Monday that there were no known injuries from
the toy, but that the action is being taken as a precaution.
   The whistles break apart easily and small parts could be ingested
by a child, the commission said. It said the company received a
consumer complaint that a child sucked the metal noisemaker from the
whistle into his mouth and then coughed it out.
   The toy consists of sets of five or eight 1}-inch solid-color
plastic whistles identified as ``Siren Whistles'' from Lucky Star
Enterprises and Unique Industries. They are manufactured in Taiwan.
   Consumers were advised to return the toys to Toys ``R'' Us.
   The commission also said Arcotoys Inc. has announced a voluntary
recall of certain toy vehicles and the character ``Goofy'' in its
Disney Donald's Fun Farm and Disney World Airport.
   Commission tests showed wheels attached to the vehicles' axles
and Goofy's ears could separate and be swallowed. No injuries have
been reported.
   Consumers may remove the items and return them to Arcotoys Inc.,
800 Shemes Drive, Westbury, N.Y. 11590 for an exchange.
   In the Disney Donald's Fun Farm, No. 6112, remove the four-wheel
tractor.
   In the Disney World Airport, No. 6113, remove the four-wheel
blue, yellow and red vehicles that have blue or yellow wheels; and
remove the ``Goofy,'' which has long ears, a gold hat and shoes, an
orange shirt, a green vest, brown pants and white hands.

<NOTE>Avanti Convertibles Can Miss Passive Restraint Deadline</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The upscale Avanti convertible is the only
1990-model car not required to be equipped with air bags or
motorized seat belts.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday gave
Avanti Automotive Corp. a two-year reprieve from the passive
restraint requirement, saying it agreed complying would cause
``substantial economic hardship.''
   The decision was criticized by air-bag proponent Clarence Ditlow,
director of the non-profit Center for Auto Safety.
   ``We feel that air bags are such an important life-saving
technology that there shouldn't be any exemptions from the
standard,'' he said. ``It's just one of those decisions that is so
dumb it speaks for itself.''
   In seeking the exemption, Avanti said convertibles comprise
two-thirds of its sales and noted that the small company is very
important to Youngstown, Ohio, a once-thriving steel center
suffering through a long period of high unemployment.
   The company, which intends to produce about 200 convertibles a
year, had asked for a three-year exemption. The base price of the
convertible is $47,982.

   A strong earthquake struck off Mexico early
Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survery reported. There were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The epicenter of the quake, measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale,
was in the Pacific about 250 miles southwest of Guadalajara off
Jalisco state, said Waverly Person of the survey's National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden.
   In Mexico, there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The earthquake struck at 12:16 a.m. EDT. It is not yet known if
there were any ships in the area or if there were any aftershocks
which may have caused trouble for boats.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   A quake of 6.5 on the Richter scale can cause widespread heavy
damage.

   Bob Boatman, director of the syndicated
television show ``Hee Haw'' for 17 years, accidentally shot himself
to death with a pistol, authorities say.
   Boatman, 59, was found Monday in the garage of his house in
Hendersonville, outside Nashville. He was pronounced dead at
Hendersonville Hospital a short time later.
   Police said Boatman accidentally shot himself in the stomach
after he pulled out a drawer that contained a .22-caliber revolver.
The gun hit the floor and discharged, they said.
   Boatman had been directing ``Hee Haw'' since 1972.
   Producer Sam Louvello said Boatman was a ``warm, honest upright
person and a very laid-back person.''
   ``He was a friend and a consummate professional. I loved him,''
said show regular George Lindsey, also known as ``Goober'' from his
role on The Andy Griffith Show.
   Cast member Lulu Roman called Boatman ``an incredibly gifted and
talented man with a genuine sweet and compassionate spirit.''
   ``He always encouraged me by telling me I was a million-dollar
baby. Bob will always hold a very special place in my heart,'' Roman
said.
   Boatman is survived by his wife, Anne, a manager for The
Nashville Network, the cable music network; seven children and two
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Senate Seeks Closure of U.S. Bases, Challenges Mrs. Aquino</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate calls to close U.S. military
bases in two years have increased pressure on President Corazon
Aquino and set the stage for difficult talks with Washington on the
future of the strategically important installations.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to say whether she favors keeping the six
U.S. bases, which employ more than 70,000 Filipinos. But opposition
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, one of the co-sponsors of a resolution
seeking the base closures, said the proposal is aimed at forcing her
to take a stand.
   U.S. and Filipino officials are to begin talks later this year on
a new treaty to replace the Military Bases Agreement, which expires
in September 1991. Mrs. Aquino is expected to discuss the issue when
she visits Washington in November.
   ``That Senate resolution looks like the genie out of the
bottle,'' wrote former presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno in the
Philippine Daily Star. ``And it will take a lot of political genius
on the part of the Aquino administration to put the genie back in
the bottle.''
   Twelve senators sponsored the resolution last Thursday. Under the
constitution, any agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the
23-member Senate, so the resolution shows the Aquino administration
lacks the votes for ratification.
   U.S. officials claim the installations, including Clark Air Base
and the Subic Bay naval base, are essential for maintaining the
military balance in the Far East and protecting sea lanes to
pro-Western nations such as Japan, Singapore and Thailand.
   About 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian
employees are stationed at the bases, among the oldest and largest
U.S. garrisons abroad.
   Assuming Mrs. Aquino supports an extension, she has a number of
options for pressuring the Senate into ratification. Most political
surveys indicate a majority of Filipinos support the bases, which
pay more than $96 million in local salaries annually.
   But the Senate's view reflects that of the nationalistic urban
classes, which see the bases as a vestige of colonialism. Political
analysts say Mrs. Aquino could call for a referendum on the bases
and then pressure the Senate into accepting the national will.
   Mrs. Aquino could also use a discrepancy between U.S. and
Filipino interpretation of the expiration date.
   The constitution says the agreement expires in 1991. But U.S.
officials say the agreement actually says that after Sept. 16, 1991,
either side can terminate with one-year's notice. Without
notification, the agreement runs indefinitely, they say.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt prefers to sidestep the ambiguity,
saying he would like a new agreement negotiated and ratified before
the 1991 cutoff.
   Faced with Senate rejection, the Aquino administration could
delay the ratification vote until after a new Congress is elected in
May 1992, four months before the end of the notification period.
   In any event, most analysts see long and difficult negotiations
before any new agreement can be forged. This is due in part to a
wide gap between U.S. and Filipino views of the bases.
   To Washington, the bases are America's contribution to the
defense of the Philippines, a commitment that transcends dollars and
cents. Because the bases are here, the United States would defend
the Philippines with American blood.
   As an island people hundreds of miles removed from the Asian
mainland, Filipinos do not perceive an external threat. To them, the
threat is internal _ Communist and Moslem insurgents. In those
conflicts, the bases are irrelevant.
   Therefore, Filipino officials view the bases as a business deal,
a means of luring U.S. economic aid.
   ``She is not pro-bases per se,'' wrote Benigno of Mrs. Aquino.
``Like many Filipinos, she is pro-bases only because she is
convinced she can use the bases for extracting the maximum
assistance or rental from the Americans.''
   Platt, however, says the United States is not prepared to pay
more. Last October, Washington agreed to pay $461 million a year to
keep the bases until 1991.
   ``I told them that if they are waiting for foreign aid to more
than double, they have a long wait coming,'' said Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., who visited the Philippines this month. ``Either
a base is necessary for mutual defense or it is not.''

   China and the
Federated States of Micronesia agreed today to establish full
diplomatic relations.
   Zai Zhang, China's ambassador to Australia, and Andon Amaraich,
the federated states' secretary for external affairs, signed a joint
communique making relations official.
   The federated states recognize the People's Republic of China as
the sole legal government of China, according to the document. Zhang
said China will assist the federated states in joining international
organizations such as the Asian Development Bank.
   The federate states extend across the 1,800-mile-long Caroline
Island archipelago and include the states of Pohnpei, Kosrae, Truk
and Yap, all formerly part of the U.S. Trust Territory of the
Pacific.
   The states, with a population of about 85,000 and located about
3,000 miles southwest of Hawaii, entered into a free association
with the United States in 1986, terminating the trust territory
control established by the United Nations in 1947.

<TEXT>
   The threat of court and legislative action to
restrict or outlaw abortion is leading some women to consider
reviving an old underground movement that performed clandestine
abortions.
   The group _ called Jane after a pseudonym some of the women used
at the time _ performed as many as 13,000 abortions in the four
years before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized the procedure in 1973,
said former organizer Jody Howard.
   The high court's decision July 3 allowing states to place
restrictions on abortions and the threat of further court
restrictions may make it necessary to revive the group, said Ms.
Howard and Ruth Surgal, another key Jane member.
   ``It's time for new people to move in, a new generation,'' said
Ms. Howard, 48, now a freelance writer. ``I will do everything in my
power to teach them everything I know, but I would hope it wouldn't
be necessary.''
   Jane, believed to have been the only group of its kind in the
United States, involved about 120 Chicago-area women who were
trained, in some cases by sympathetic doctors, to perform abortions.
They worked clandestinely from 1969 to 1972 under constant threat of
arrest.
   ``Already (courts) are making it harder. The laws may make it
illegal, but women are going to keep it available. I'm convinced,''
Ms. Howard said.
   At a recent pro-choice march in Washington, she said, a number of
women from various states said they would establish similar
underground groups and take the movement nationwide if abortion were
outlawed again.
   ``It's easier if you have a role model somehow because it gives
people courage,'' said Ms. Surgal, 51.
   Andrew Scholberg, assistant director of the Chicago-based
Pro-Life Action League, said his group would battle any attempt to
revive an underground abortion network.
   ``We'll see to it that they're prosecuted to the fullest extent
of the law,'' he said. ``We'll have spies, we'll have to have people
claiming to be seeking out abortions ... to find out who the illegal
abortionists are so they can be punished.''
   In addition, he challenged the ability of Jane members to perform
abortions safely.
   ``I seriously doubt their safety record,'' he said. ``No abortion
is safe because it always kills the baby.''
   Women who were active in the group said 3 percent of treated
women developed complications, usually infections, but that no women
died.
   Statistics from The Alan Guttmacher Institute, the New York-based
research branch of Planned Parenthood, placed the complication rate
for abortions performed by doctors at about 1 percent.
   Seven Jane members were arrested in 1972 despite frequent changes
in locations where the abortions were performed. The charges were
dropped after the Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.
   Ms. Howard said she would risk going to jail to give women the
freedom to choose abortion.
   ``What's more important, my staying out of jail or a woman having
to have an abortion?'' she said.

   The dollar on Tuesday inched down against the
Japanese yen, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 144.15 yen, down 0.13 yen from Monday's
finish of 144.28 yen. It began trading at 144.58 yen, its high for
the day, and moved as low as 144.00 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 80.24 points, or 0.23 percent, closing at 34,687.65.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range as
investors were cautious because of a possible intervention by the
central bank and profit-taking as the dollar moved on the upper side
of the 144-yen level.
   The Bank of Japan, which sold dollars Monday to stem the dollar's
rapid rise against the yen, did not intervene in Tokyo morning
dealing, traders said.
   ``I think (the central bank) will have no choice but to intervene
if the dollar reaches about 144.70 yen,'' said a trader of a major
Japanese bank, who spoke anonymously.
   Other dealers said the market was awaiting this week a series of
U.S. economic indicators, including the unemployment figures for
August, due out Friday.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index rose moderately as
investors hunted incentive-backed issues at the start of trading but
later held back on profit-taking, dealers said.
   Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities said morning trading was
thin and that there was no effect on overall trading from a planned
merger of two major Japanese banks.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced it suspended trading on Mitsui
Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank for the day to avoid confusion in
connection with the announcement of a planned merger of the two
major Japanese banks next April. ``Tuesday's trading on both issues
was suspended from the start to get investors familar with
information on the merger,'' said Hiroshi Nakamura, an exchange
spokesman.
   Mitsui Bank, the country's seventh-largest bank, and Taiyo Kobe,
the eighth largest, will merge into a bank to be called Taiyo Kobe
Mitsui Bank, the second-largest bank in Japan after the Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, ranked the largest in the world in terms of assets,
executives from the two banks told a news conference Tuesday morning.

   Florida law enforcement agents have
increased security around Gov. Bob Martinez because of fears of a
backlash from Colombian drug lords under pressure.
   ``There has been a general warning, a general concern of
high-profile public officials on the subject of drugs,'' Martinez
said Monday. ``The Florida Department of Law Enforcement just feels
a little bit more comfortable, at least in these next few days,
being a little more cautious.''
   The bolstered protection began late Friday after state agents
were tipped by federal sources that Colombian drug lords had
threatened a political assassination in the United States if any of
the targeted drug dealers were extradited from Colombia, Martinez
said.
   The governor said his recent trip to South America to survey
drug-fighting efforts made him a prime target. He also serves as the
National Governors' Association's leader on substance abuse and drug
trafficking.
   Last Friday, Martinez asked Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
to extradite 25 Florida drug fugitives should they be arrested by
Colombian authorities.
   ``I recognize the importance of the United States doing all it
can to ensure that the drug merchants who threaten our society are
brought to justice,'' Martinez wrote.
   Martinez said he understood the threat against American officials
was tied to the scheduled extradition Wednesday of a Colombian drug
dealer.
   Brian Ballard, director of operations for Martinez, said the
governor's public schedule, which is normally published days in
advance for distribution to the press, will now be on a day-to-day
basis.
   Martinez said he had received death threats while Tampa mayor and
also as governor.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estranged husband burst into his wife's
birthday party and shot and killed her and three other people,
minutes after the woman had called authorities to say she feared an
attack.
   Authorities said Maria Delia Navarro called the sheriff's
department on Sunday night alarmed about a threat from Raymondo
Navarro Jr. About 15 minutes later Navarro crashed the party and
opened fire.
   Navarro, 26, was arrested Monday outside his father's East Los
Angeles apartment and booked for investigation of murder and
attempted murder.
   Mrs. Navarro had been celebrating her 27th birthday with about 20
family members. The other victims were her aunts, Maria Garcia, 65,
and Francisca Arizpe, 62, and a friend, Leticia M. Dipp, 46, said
coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher.
   A third aunt, Berta Galvan, 47, was listed in critical condition
late Monday with a head wound. Another party guest, Richard
Covarrubias, was listed in serious condition with a wound to the
abdomen.
   The Navarro's three children were not hurt.
   Shortly before the attack, a man called and warned Mrs. Navarro,
``Your husband is coming to kill you.''
   Mrs. Navarro called the 911 emergency line, but a deputy told her
there was nothing police could do until the husband arrived at the
house, according to a transcript of the conversation.
   ``You have to make a judgment call over whether a threat is
emergent or immediate. If he was there with a gun, that would have
gotten a real immediate response,'' Sgt. Lynda Edmonds, a sheriff's
spokeswoman, said Monday. ``People get threatened all the time, but
that's a fact of life.''
   Mrs. Navarro had filed for divorce and custody of the children
about 17 months ago. She and Navarro had been high school
sweethearts. In court records, she contended he physically and
mentally abused her and the children during the past five years.

   The U.S. dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained
moderately following a five-day decline.
   The dollar closed at 144.15 yen, down 0.13 yen from Monday's
finish of 144.28 yen, a nine-week high. It opened today at 144.58
yen, its high for the day, and ranged as low as 144.00 yen in the

   Currency dealers said dollars were being sold to take profits.
   A dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank added that when the dollar climbs
above 144.50 yen, ``players get nervous about intervention'' by the
central bank.
   Fear of intervention kept the dollar in a narrow range today,
said the dealer.

   Profit-taking late in the day checked the index's rise, dealers

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
says he plans to contact the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels to obtain
their cooperation with a peace plan calling for their disarmament.
   Five Central American nations have asked the United Nations to
monitor the voluntary disbanding of up to 11,000 Contras camped in
Honduras, and the repatriation of as many as 12,000 of their
dependents.
   ``They are asking us to monitor operations to disarm the
opposition, and that is something that is very complicated and is
not very much in our practice,'' Perez de Cuellar said after
briefing the Security Council on Monday.
   ``That is why I need assurances that if we send people there,
there is cooperation from the resistance forces,'' he said.
   The presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and
Costa Rica signed an accord Aug. 7 calling for the disbanding of the
Contras 90 days after a joint resettlement mission of U.N. and
Organization of American States representatives is formed.
   ``We'll be in contact with the resistance, to find ways and means
to be in touch with them in order to have assurances from them that
they will accept disarming, to give their arms to the United
Nations,'' the U.N. chief said.
   These contacts will take place ``as soon as possible,'' he added.
   The secretary-general of the OAS, Joao Clemente Baena Soares of
Brazil, and Perez de Cuellar announced Friday they will launch the
mission Sept. 6.
   By having the ``International Support and Verification
Commission'' begin its work on that date, the OAS and U.N. chiefs
set Dec. 5 as the target date for the voluntary repatriation.
   Numerous Contra field commanders and guerrillas have vowed they
will not give up their fight.
   A U.N. diplomat active in Central American affairs, however, said
preliminary talks with the Contras indicate they are quite willing
to go home or be resettled, and said little resistance is expected.
   The United States had lobbied the Central American nations to
allow the Contras to stay in their camps through the Feb. 25
national elections in Nicaragua, to maintain pressure on the leftist
Sandinista government to allow a fair campaign.
   Even Honduras, however, which has received lavish military and
foreign aid from Washington, agreed earlier this month there was no
justification to continue their mission.
   The United States gives the Contras $4.5 million a month in
non-lethal aid that may also be used for resettlement.
   Congress cut off funds for weapons last year, prompting the
Contras to arrange a truce with Nicaragua's government last year.
Since then they have launched only sporadic raids.

   Investigators looking into the nation's worst
oil spill and parties to litigation arising from it have started
inspecting the Exxon Valdez, the supertanker that caused the
disaster.
   Drucella Andersen, a Washington, D.C.-based spokeswoman for the
National Transportation Safety Board, said two of the agency's
investigators arrived Monday at a San Diego shipyard to begin their
anticipated five-day inspection.
   The Valdez is in a National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. dry dock
for a nine-month repair job estimated to cost $25 million.
   The ship's hull was shredded, causing about 11 million gallons of
crude to spill into Alaskan waters, when it struck a reef March 24
in Prince William Sound.
   Andersen said the inspection is the first look at the tanker's
hull outside of the water since the grounding. The inspectors
findings will be included in the NTSB report on the spill, which is
expected to be finished early next year, she said.
   Others in San Diego to examine the Valdez are an Alaskan state
investigator and representatives of Exxon Shipping Co. and the
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of seven oil companies
that includes Exxon, said Andersen.
   The state of Alaska is suing Exxon in connection with the spill,
which devastated hundreds of miles of pristine shoreline and killed
scores of waterfowl and marine wildlife. Alyeska also is a defendant
in the case.
   Les Rogers, an Exxon spokesman in Houston, said the inspections
are being conducted ``because the vessel itself is considered
evidence and they want a first-hand look at it.''
   He declined to elaborate because of the pending litigation.
   Shipyard workers will begin repairing the ship's damaged hull
after the inspections are complete.
   ``We can't start work (until then) because of certain court
orders that restrict any work that would cut or modify the ship,''
said Fred Hallett, NASSCO's vice president of finance and public
relations.
   ``Engineering, procurement and fabrication of steel outside the
ship are continuing, so we are still proceeding with the job. We
just can't proceed with the rip out of the damaged sections of the
hull.''
   The Valdez was towed from Alaska, arriving off the San Diego
coast July 10. It was kept from entering San Diego Bay for three
weeks, however, because of oily slicks sighted near the ship when it
reached Southern California.
   Huge steel plates that were peeled downward from the hull during
the 2,500-mile journey also had to be cut off by divers at sea so
they wouldn't drag bottom in the bay.
   The tanker docked at a NASSCO pier July 30 after the
environmental and navigational problems were fixed to the
satisfaction of state and federal officials.
   The Valdez floated into a dock for the repair work Aug. 15.
   Pumping operations to remove water trapped inside the enclosed
repair dock were completed Friday. The water was transferred to
another Exxon ship, which will take it to a processing facility at
an Exxon refinery in Northern California.
   During the weekend, shipyard workers washed down the dock to
remove sand, silt and marine growth. The debris was put into barrels
and trucked to a San Diego hazardous waste dump for disposal.
   ``The dock is now dry and clean so the appropriate individuals
can inspect the ship,'' Hallett said.

   Kent County Sheriff's Deputy Jayson
Beute is ready to help deliver babies any time anywhere _ even at a
bait shop.
   Beute helped deliver a healthy baby girl Sunday at the Open
Season Bait Shop, where the baby's frantic parents stopped when they
realized they wouldn't get to a hospital on time.
   ``I put the gloves on and a catcher's mitt, and we did our thing
right in front of the cash register,'' said Beute, who has helped
deliver two other babies in his 15 years with the department.
   The parents, Rusty Parrish, 18, and Stacy Heminger, 19, were 20
minutes into their ride to the hospital at about 6:30 a.m. Sunday,
when Heminger realized they were running out of time.
   ``I told him to pull over and call somebody,'' she said.
   Parrish called police from a pay phone and carried the
mother-to-be to the bait shop.
   Heminger and the infant, Brittany Nicole, were in good condition
Monday at Metropolitan Hospital in Grand Rapids.

   No more sniffing and prodding to tell if a
melon is ripe _ government scientists have introduced a fail-safe
method: the melon meter.
   U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers have developed an
infrared device that measures the sugar content of watermelons,
cantaloupes and honeydews.
   Gerald Dull, a USDA chemist in Athens, said 16 years of research
yielded the melon meter, which shines infrared light into the top of
the fruit and then measures the amount of light that comes out the
side.
   The computerized device determines the amount of soluable solids,
based on how much light the fruit absorbs. Soluble solids are
predominantly sugars.
   ``The No. 1 parameter of quality is sweetness,'' Dull said in an
interview. ``If you haven't got sweetness, you haven't got a good
melon.''
   Growers and consumers currently have to rely on appearance in
judging ripeness and quality, Dull said, but similar-looking melons
can vary from 5 percent to 10 percent in sweetness.
   ``There's no one who can look at the outside and tell you whether
that melon is good,'' he said.
   Several companies have expressed an interesting in producing
melon meters, Dull said, and they probably will be installed
initially in packing sheds, where the fruit is graded, packed and
shipped.
   He believes they will appeal to suppliers who want to provide
consumers with the highest quality melons.
   ``I think we're just opening the door'' on analyzing fresh
produce, he said. ``With computers and high-speed equipment, we
might be able to get down to (measuring) the vitamins.''

<HEAD>Ex-Interior Minister Faces 20-Year Maximum Penalty in Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former interior minister of Cuba faces a
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison in a drug and corruption
scandal, the official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported.
   Divison Gen. Jose Abrantes Fernandez also faces demotion from
general to private, the news agency said in a dispatch monitored
Monday in Mexico City. The dispatch did not say when a verdict was
expected.
   Abrantes was tried on charges of abusing power, neglecting his
duties and enriching himself by stealing from the government, Prensa
Latina said.
   Prosecutors requested the stiff sentence Sunday at the end of
four days of testimony before a military tribunal.
   The trial is the latest chapter in a drug trafficking scandal
that has shaken the Caribbean island, disrupted the nation's
reputation for communist discipline, and sent four officers to the
firing squad. One of them was a highly decorated war hero.
   The tribunal also was asked for sentences ranging from eight to
15 years in prison for six other ministry officials, including the
former vice interior minister and the former head of customs, the
news agency said.
   The defendants are accused of using their government posts for
private gain; the prosecution asked the tribunal to confiscate the
profits.
   Castro fired Abrantes as interior minister in June, when 12
military officers from the ministry and two from the army were
charged with drug smuggling and other crimes. Four were executed and
the others are serving up to 30 years in prison.
   The prosecution said Abrantes fumbled the drug-trafficking
investigation so badly that his mistakes appeared deliberate, but it
said the evidence did not support a charge of treason, Prensa Latina
said.
   Abrantes knew as early as February that officials of his ministry
were involved in drug trafficking but did nothing about it, the
prosecution charged.
   Castro had personally ordered Abrantes to conduct the
investigation after persistent reports that tons of Colombian
cocaine and Jamaican marijuana were moving through Cuba to the
United States.
   The prosecution asked the tribunal to sentence the former vice
interior minister, Division Gen. Pascual Martinez Gil, to 15 years
and demote him to private for abuse of power and stealing from the
government.
   It requested a 13-year sentence for bribery and abuse of power
for Lt. Col. Oscar Carreno Gomez, former head of customs, and said
he should be demoted to the rank of foot soldier.
   Abrantes, Carreno Gomez and four others are accused of taking
money from some of the officers arrested in June. Prensa Latina said
Abrantes allegedly accumulated millions of dollars in an illegal
fund set up at the ministry.
   The chief prosecutor, Felipe Aleman Cruz, said he was so consumed
with ``dollar fever'' that he traded Cuban pesos on the black market
for his own profit.
   Castro, who has for years denied U.S. charges of Cuban complicity
in the drug trade, said the officers involved in narcotics were
traitors to his cause.

<HEAD>Giamatti, Rose Differ on Agreement</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Similar version on sports wires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said
the agreement banning Pete Rose from baseball leaves Giamatti free
to express his opinion that the former Cincinnati Reds manager bet
on baseball.
   But Rose said he felt double-crossed by Giamatti's remarks, made
during the news conference last Thursday at New York in which the
commissioner announced Rose's lifetime banishment.
   ``Just 12 hours earlier, we signed that agreement in good faith,
and there he was saying he thinks I bet on baseball,'' Rose told The
Cincinnati Post in an interview published Monday.
   ``The only reason I signed that agreement was that it had no
finding that I bet on baseball. We got what we wanted, and we didn't
have to go another eight months and spend another three-quarters of
a million dollars,'' Rose said.
   On Monday, Giamatti said that Rose appeared to misunderstand the
agreement.
   ``I was very clear about the fact that I was not going to be
constrained from saying what I thought was the case,'' Giamatti told
The Associated Press by telephone from Cape Cod, Mass. ``I'm not
going to change anything I said.''
   Giamatti, asked at the news conference whether he thought Rose
had bet on baseball, replied, ``Based on the evidence and in the
absence of a hearing, I have concluded that, yes, he bet on
baseball.''
   Deputy commissioner Francis Vincent, Jr., and Rose's lawyer,
Reuven Katz, drafted the agreement, which includes a stipulation
that Rose neither admits nor denies betting on baseball.
   Katz acknowledged that Vincent had told him what Giamatti's
reponse would be to a question about whether Rose bet on baseball.
   ``That's true, he did,'' Katz said. ``Maybe I misunderstood.
Maybe I wasn't altogether clear on what Mr. Giamatti would say. I
think that I was surprised that (Giamatti's statement) was that
strong, that he put it that way and that it came so fast.''
   Giamatti said he based his opinion on the 225-page report by
baseball investigator John Dowd. The agreement noted that baseball
rules allow Rose to apply for reinstatement after a year but don't
guarantee that he can return.
   Rose said he's considering a television appearance to tell his
side of the story.
   ``We've got some good minds working on it,'' Rose said. ``The key
thing is, we'll tell the story and let the people decide. But I
don't know how I'm going to do it.''
   The Internal Revenue Service and a federal grand jury in
Cincinnati are reportedly investigating whether Rose illegally
concealed winnings from gambling or sales of memorabilia.
   The FBI has dropped an earlier reported investigation of Rose.

<HEAD>More Rain in Plains; Roads Flooded in Kansas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms continued in the central Plains this morning after
bringing torrential rain to parts of Kansas and Iowa.
   Several days of thundershowers have left the ground saturated,
especially in eastern Kansas and western Missouri. Flash flood
watches were in effect for northeast and east-central Kansas, part
of northwest Missouri and the southeast corner of Nebraska, where
storms were continuing early today.
   Water covered the highway north of Hanover, Kan., where 2{ inches
of rain fell Monday evening. More than 1} inches of rain fell in
Chase County, and some county roads were under water near Newton.
   Two to 3 inches of rain fell in parts of south-central and
southeast Kansas, and 1\ inches fell at Wichita in one hour. Lamoni,
Iowa, recorded 2.92 inches in the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   Thunderstorms also produced three-quarter inch hail in Elk
County, Kan., and marble-size hail fell at Julian in southeast
Nebraska. Winds gusted to near 60 mph in eastern Nemaha County, Neb.
   Thunderstorms also dropped heavy rain on portions of the Middle
Atlantic states. Baltimore received 1.65 inches in one hour and a
total of 2.60 inches in the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   Rain and scattered thunderstorms were over the lower Great Lakes
early today.
   Skies were mostly clear this morning from the Dakotas across the
Rockies to the West Coast states. Dense fog developed over northeast
Nebraska, with visibilities down to little more than 100 yards.
   Today's forecast called for widespread showers and thunderstorms
from much of New England across New York and Pennsylvania to the
Ohio Valley; scattered showers and thunderstorms from Michigan
across the middle Mississippi Valley and much of Kansas to the
southern Rockies; and widely scattered thunderstorms from southern
Texas across the Gulf Coast and the Tennessee Valley to the southern
Atlantic states.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s over the northern Atlantic
coastal states, portions of the Great Lakes and along the Canadian
border from Minnesota to Montana; the 60s and 70s along the Pacific
coast; near 100 degrees in the southern Plains; and between 100 and
105 degrees in the Desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs were expected
to be in the 80s and 90s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 36 degrees at Yellowstone,

<HEAD>Helmsley Bodyguard Found at Jury's Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Leona Helmsley's bodyguards was found in
the hotel where the jurors in her tax evasion trial were sequestered
and rode the elevator with one juror, according to a report today.
   But there was ``an innocent explanation and both the government
and court are satisfied,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita told
the New York Post.
   The 12-member jury in Leona Helmsley's tax evasion and extortion
trial was heading into a fourth day of deliberations today.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is charged with evading $1.2 million in
federal taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations
at her Connecticut mansion, to her businesses.
   DeVita and defense attorney Gerald Feffer would not say why the
unnamed bodyguard was in the hotel Friday night.
   In court papers, U.S. District Court Judge John Walker told
Feffer to ``convey to his client to tell her people to stay out of
the hotel.''
   ``Needless to say, this is not a Helmsley hotel,'' Walker said.
Leona Helmsley and her husband Harry are among the biggest owners of
hotels and other real estate in New York.
   The judge said a federal marshal was escorting a juror back to
her hotel room after dinner Friday when one of Mrs. Helmsley's
security guards got on the same elevator.
   The marshal purposely pushed the elevator button for the wrong
floor so the guard would not know which floor the juror was staying
on, according to the judge in the transcript.
   The juror, misunderstanding the situation, pushed the correct
button. However, the juror and the guard got off the elevator on
different floors.
   ``If the Helmsley security people think they are doing their
client a favor by investigating where the jurors are, the rooms the
jurors are staying in or what floor the jurors are staying in or a
particular hotel, they are not,'' Walker said.
   Two Helmsley guards appeared before the judge, but the transcript
of the hearing, including the identity of the guard in question, was
sealed.

<HEAD>Youths Battle Police at Carnival; 37 Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty officers and seven civilians were injured
when rowdy youths ended an otherwise peaceful Afro-Caribbean
carnival by pelting police with cans and bottles, authorities said
today.
   Scotland Yard said 37 were injured and 250 arrested during the
two-day carnival in the Notting Hill district that ended Monday
night after drawing about 500,000 people.
   St. John Ambulance, however, said it treated 269 people _ 21 of
them policemen _ during the festival. Fifty people were
hospitalized, although there was ``nothing of a serious nature,'' a
spokesman said.
   One officer was stabbed but was not seriously hurt, said the
Yard, headquarters of the London police.
   The Yard said charges against those arrested included possession
of weapons and drugs, and disorderly behavior.
   It blamed groups of youths ``determined to provoke disorder'' for
violence in the carnival's closing hours when police were struck by
tossed cans and bottles.
   Police with riot shields tackled the rampaging youths. The Yard
said about 5,000 officers were on the streets, some on horseback,
and a police helicopter was overhead as the violence flared.
   The clashes took place at the close of what was earlier called
the most peaceful of the Afro-Caribbean festivals that have been
held for 24 years during the late August three-day bank holiday
weekend.
   Deputy assistant police commissioner Charles Rideout said the day
had been ``most successful'' until the clashes.
   Police estimated 200,000 people on Sunday and 300,000 on Monday
jammed the streets to see the spectacularly dressed paraders, street
performers and bands in what has become a cultural focal point for
London's black community.
   Riots, muggings and other violence marred previous festivals and
a man was fatally stabbed in 1987.
   Conservative lawmaker Terry Dicks said the carnival should be
banned because of the cost of policing it, which he estimated at
$1.56 million this year.
   ``There were probably more police on the streets monitoring the
carnival than there were throughout the rest of London. It is
outrageous that we should have to pay for this,'' Dicks said.

<HEAD>Compliance Questioned on Church Call for Divestment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America's pensions board say they may not be able to comply with
church's insistence on rapid divestment from companies operating in
South Africa.
   ``Whether the law will permit us to follow this churchwide
directive, I can't answer,'' said investment specialist John Kapanke
of Minneapolis, president of the board.
   The denomination's legislative assembly on Monday voted that by
September 1991 the Board of Pensions be completely rid of stocks in
companies with ``direct or indirect'' business dealings in South
Africa.
   An estimated 80 to 85 percent of the 1,041 delegates voted for
the deadline in a show-of-cards vote. At stake was the church's $1.6
billion pension fund, of which $84.9 million is invested in
companies doing business in South Africa.
   Kapanke and Mildred Berg of New York City, chair of the board,
pointed out the board was incorporated separately from the church
and thus was not legally bound by its instructions, although sharing
its purposes and principles.
   ``The board has a right not to accept it if we feel it is
violating our fiduciary responsibility,'' Ms. Berg said at a news
conference. ``But we take that mandate seriously in regard to
investments.''
   The vote by delegates of the newly merged 5.3 million-member
denomination is intended to put pressure on South Africa to end its
apartheid system of race separation.
   ``It puts teeth into our concern,'' the Rev. Joseph Ellwanger of
Milwaukee said of the deadline. He said if the church can't ``hear
the voices of blacks crying for justice above the call of profit
yield, then it doesn't mean anything to be called the body of
Christ.'
   Before the vote, Kapanke said a deadline threatened financial
responsibility.
   ``It puts us in an almost impossible situation to act in a
prudent way,'' Kapanke said. To ``introduce controls'' over
investing of funds, he said, ``jeopardizes them and increases risk.''
   Ms. Berg said the time limit imposed for the divestment process
was ``too short. We would have great difficulty accomplishing that
goal. We do recognize the frustration of the church about it.''
   Forty-four of the 65 regional synods had demanded total
divestment from South Africa, as had predecessor denominations of
the merged body, but none had fixed a deadline for it.
   The assembly, entering the next to last day of an eight-day
meeting, also approved a major, long-range program, called Mission
90, to strengthen Bible teaching, evangelism and work for the cause
of peace and justice.
   The meeting is the first since the 1988 merger of the Lutheran
Church in America, the American Lutheran Church and the Association
of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.

   American and Thai troops today
assaulted a beach along the Gulf of Thailand to climax six weeks of
war games codenamed ``Thalay Thai 89.''
   Several thousand local villagers watched as troops and tanks hit
the beach before sunrise from amphibious craft. Helicopters
clattered overhead, providing simulated support.
   A news release said 4,000 U.S. Marines and naval personnel from
both countries joined in the exercise, which also included maneuvers
on land after the landing.
   The Aug. 9 to Sept. 19 exercise is designed to strengthen combat
effectiveness and cooperation between the two countries, which have
close, longstanding ties.
   In the past, such joint war games, including the annual Cobra
Gold series, have drawn sharp criticism from neighboring communist
Indochina, which claims the United States is using such exercises to
reintroduce its military power into Southeast Asia.
   Thalay Thai 89 has included mine-laying and demolition
operations, navigation training, and anti-surface and anti-aircraft
warfare exercises.
   Taking part are 23 Thai and 26 U.S. naval vessels, including the
aircraft carrier USS Midway. American units include elements of the
Amphibious Ready Group ALFA and the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit.

   At a funeral for slain Black Panther
co-founder Huey Newton, friends called his death a ``clarion call''
to free black communities of drug-related violence and mourners
chanted ``Free Huey,'' a reminder of an earlier period of militancy.
   ``His problem with chemical dependency represents all our
weaknesses in America,'' said Newton's friend and fellow Panther
David Hilliard during the service Monday.
   Among the 1,200 people attending the service at the Allen Temple
Baptist Church were H. Rap Brown, leader of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee, and Panther co-founder Bobby Seale. Hundreds
of others milled around in the streets outside.
   Many in the congregation gave raised-fist salutes when Seale, 52,
donned a black beret and said ``all power to the people'' during his
turn at the pulpit.
   The mourners left the church chanting ``Free Huey,'' the refrain
that sounded during Newton's frequent imprisonments beginning in the
1960s.
   Newton, 47, was killed early Aug. 22 in the poor West Oakland
neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years
ago. Police said Newton died in a dispute over crack cocaine.
   While Hilliard said Newton's violent death should be used as a
``clarion call'' to solve national problems with drugs and alcohol,
many of the mourners remembered Newton as a hero of the bold and
belligerent black pride movement.
   Members of Newton's family, friends and fellow radicals recalled
the days when the Black Panthers espoused the cause of black
liberation and ``the power of the gun'' against white authority.
   Johnny Spain, a former Black Panther who recently won a new trial
in the 1971 killings of two prison guards, spoke at the funeral
about problems still facing blacks.
   ``After the dust clears and next week, little kids say `Huey
who?' remember that in someone's community ... a human being was
gunned down and that should serve as a notice that there's a lot of
work to do,'' said Spain, 40, who joined the Panthers while serving
time at San Quentin Prison.
   Newton and Seale founded the Black Panther Party in Oakland in
1966. As the party's minister of defense and chief ideologue, Newton
became one of the most articulate leaders of the black militancy
movement.
   The Panthers embraced Maoist political theory and espoused the
use of arms for defense against police, whom they called racist. A
Black Panther poster distributed nationally during the orgnization's
heyday pictured Newton sitting on an African wicker throne, a spear
in one hand, a shotgun in the other.
   Many of Newton's admirers discounted police accounts and blamed
his death on authorities with whom Newton battled for decades.
   Newton had a long criminal history including a manslaughter
conviction in the 1967 shooting death of a police officer. He was
freed after 22 months when an appellate court sent the case back to
trial court.
   While in prison in March on a narcotics paraphernalia possession
charge, Newton received a suspended two-year sentence in connection
with the theft of $15,000 in state funds from community schools
operated by the Panthers.
   Tyrone Robinson, 25, who is accused of shooting Newton, appeared
in court briefly Monday and was ordered by Alameda County Municipal
Court Judge Horace Wheatley to return Sept. 5 to enter a plea.
   Robinson allegedly shot Newton with a companion's gun after
pistol-whipping the former Panther leader with his own gun, which
jammed, the San Francisco Examiner reported today.
   Being struck with the gun ``would explain the trauma to the right
side of Newton's face,'' the report said, quoting from a detailed
log of the investigation kept by Oakland Homicide Sgt. Dan Mercado.
   ``Then Robinson wrestled the witness' gun away from him because
Robinson's gun jammed,'' Mercado said. ``And Robinson fired three
times, striking Newton.''
   Police have said Robinson told them he shot Newton in
self-defense after Newton, who had battled drug and alcohol
addictions, pulled a gun and demanded crack cocaine.
   Police said they don't believe Robinson's account and think the
slaying was his bid to rise in the Black Guerrilla Family, a
drug-running prison-based gang that Newton allegedly had angered.

<HEAD>Expect 28- to 32-Cent Stamp in 1991, Postmaster General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-class letters will probably cost 28 to 32
cents to mail in three years and could include an 11-digit zip code
by the turn of the century, says the postmaster general.
   Increased automation and other economies at the U.S. Postal
Service will most likely keep price increases for mailing a letter
below inflation after 1991, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said
Monday.
   Speaking at the opening of a three-day convention of major
Northeastern large-volume mailers, Frank said the actual increase
for a first-class stamp by 1991 might be 5 cents, to a total of 30
cents.
   ``I'll point out that 5 cents is a 20 percent increase in three
years, which is more or less the amount that the costs have gone up
over the last three years,'' Frank said.
   The cost of mailing a first-class letter rose from 22 cents to 25
cents in the spring of 1988. An increase in 1991 would continue the
recent policy of increases every three years.
   Frank said that after running a surplus last fiscal year, the
postal service will be hard pressed to break even in the current
year and faces the greatest deficit in its existence, up to $1.7
billion, in fiscal 1990.
   Automation will cost the postal service $4 billion between now
and 1995 but will save having to hire 100,000 workers, he said.
   New machines exist that can scan nine miles of mail an hour and
can spot a bar code anywhere on the face of an envelope, even one
sandwiched into a cluttered address block or placed amid graphics
and colorful designs.
   Scanners now in use at post offices can pick up a bar code only
on the lower right hand side of an envelope, isolated from the
address block and other print.
   Frank said the postal service wants to have nine-digit bar coding
on all mail by 1995 and will begin testing an 11-digit code.
   With the current nine-digit code, the so-called ZIP plus 4, a
piece of mail is automatically sorted to one or another side of a
specific street in a given locale.
   The 11-digit code would sort a letter down to the building
address, in effect stacking the mail in delivery sequence for a
carrier at the destination.
   Businesses that code their own mail would get substantial postage
discounts, Frank said.

   The U.S. dollar fell in early European trading
today after Asian traders took profits ahead of the release of U.S.
gross national product figures, currency dealers said.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Trading was still thin following Monday's closure of financial
markets in London and Hong Kong for national holidays.
   Dealers said revised second quarter GNP figures could give new
impetus to the market and lift the dollar out of its tight trading
range.
   GNP is expected to be revised to show growth at a 2.5-percent
annualized rate in the second quarter, up from the previously
reported growth rate of 1.7 percent.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.13 yen to a closing 144.15 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 143.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates in London at midmorning compared with late
Monday's European rates:
   _1.9527 West German marks, down from 1.9650
   _1.6822 Swiss francs, down from 1.6940
   _6.5810 French francs, down from 6.6180
   _2.2068 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2130
   _1,401.50 Italian lire, down from 1,408.00
   _1.1715 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1753
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5741 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5635 elsewhere in Europe
late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at $359.75 a troy ounce, compared with late
Friday's $360.45. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $360.
   In Zurich, the bid was $360.25, up from $359.25 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.29 to close at $360.82.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.12 a troy ounce, down from
Friday's $5.13.

   Rescuers inched across the glaciers of
the Korakoram Mountains today in search of a Pakistani airliner
carrying 54 people that vanished four days ago.
   However, low clouds and rain continued to hamper an air search
over the rugged peaks where the twin-engine Fokker 27 Friendship was
presumed to have crashed Friday.
   ``The weather is a little better but still not good,'' said A.M.
Sarooqi, a spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines in
Islamabad, headquarters of the search. ``We have been able to get
some sorties up but visibility is a problem.''
   Two British trekkers reported seeing a low-flying plane Friday
near the 26,606-foot Nanga Parbat, or ``Naked Mountain.''
   The propeller-driven Fokker carrying 49 passengers and five crew
disappeared en route from Gilgit to Islamabad, 175 miles to the
south. The 45-minute trip offers a breathtaking view of the western
Himalayas and the eastern Korakorams.

<HEAD>After Slayings, Gov't Seeks Restraint on Videos Harmful to Youth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, in the aftermath of four child
slayings blamed on the harmful effects of horror videos, said today
that it wants the video industry to regulate how its sells and rents
violent tapes.
   The spread of videos in Japan has been remarkable in recent
years, and some ``feature brutality in the treatment of humans and
animals and are seen clearly as inhumane,'' Kiyoshi Mizuno,
director-general of the Management and Coordination Agency, said in
a statement.
   Mizuno, who also heads the agency's youth affairs administration,
which works to prevent juvenile delinquency, said he is concerned
about how such videos affect young people.
   Mizuno urged the video industry strengthen its own regulations on
the sale and rental of videos depicting cruelty. He also urged local
governments and youth organizations to study ways of regulating the
sale of potentially harmful videos.
   The request came after authorities said Tsutomu Miyazaki, a
26-year-old print shop worker, confessed to police investigators
that he kidnapped and killed four girls, aged 4 to 7, over the past
year in a Tokyo suburb.
   News coverage of the case has focused repeatedly on his room,
filled with a collection of some 5,000 videotapes, including horror
films and animation films showing violence and undressed girls.
   Investigators said one of the killings to which Miyazaki has
confessed followed the plot of one of his videotapes, ``Chiniku no
Hana'' (Flower of Blood and Flesh), in which a man follows a girl in
his car, kidnaps her and then dismembers her in his apartment.
   Kyodo News Service said the government would ask the video
industry to designate videos with violent scenes as ``adults only,''
as is done with pornographic videos in Japan.

   Police today said they found a 1,500-pound
bomb less than two miles from the border with Northern Ireland and
believe it is the largest ever found in the Irish Republic.
   The bomb was primed when it was discovered Sunday in the back of
a van at Omeath, County Louth, and was probably destined for use by
the Irish Republican Army inthe British province, police said.
   Sunday was the 10th anniversary of the IRA's murder of Lord
Mountbatten, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, and of 18 British
soldiers.
   A police spokesman said the bomb was made of homemade explosives
packed into three steel drums that were wired together. Along with
the bomb, police found drogue bombs, devices that can penetrate
armor plating, as well as bomb timers and fuse wires.
   Houses in the area were evacuated and roads were closed until the
bomb could be dismantled.
   Police said they were questioning two men who had been arrested
under Ireland's anti-terrorist laws.
   The IRA wants to end Britain's rule of Northern Ireland and unite
the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic Irish
Republic.

<HEAD>State Says It Will Fight Deportation Of Girl From Bangladesh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID AMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state will fight the deportation of a
9-year-old Bangladeshi girl who was molested by the man who brought
her to America.
   More than 200 people marched to the state capitol on Monday to
express their opposition to deporting the youngster, known as Kushi,
and afterwards they were rewarded. State officials said they would
try to obtain an education visa for the girl, allowing her to stay
indefinitely.
   The girl was taken by state workers from a foster home last week
because it wasn't ``culturally relevant.'' The girl's foster parents
were among the marchers who demanded help for the youngster.
   The state Child Protective Services said it would review the case
and fight deportation. Spokeswoman Irene Hopman said an education
visa would be sought from the federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service. She faces deportation when her visa expires Sept. 5.
   The girl is one of several members of a Bangladeshi family that
Stefan Christopher, 52, brought to this country. A U.N. consultant,
he had married one of the girl's older sisters, separated from her
and married another sister, age 12. Over the years he brought family
members to work on his Oakville farm.
   Christopher is in jail awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty
to taking indecent liberties with the girl and two other children.
Sheriff's department officials said he subjected them to ``physical
and psychological torture.''
   At the rally, the foster parents _ chemical engineer Bob Martin
and his wife, English teacher Betsy Seidel _ wept when they were
surrounded by supporters. They had feared the state would allow
Kushi to be sent back to Bangladesh where she would be outcast
because of the sexual abuse.
   ``Kushi has a magic that touches everyone,'' Martin told the
rally. ``She certainly has touched us. She was taken away from not
only us but from the whole community.
   ``Betsy and I did everything we could within the system but it
wasn't enough. Removing Kushi was wrong, just wrong,'' Martin said.
   CPS workers took Khurshida ``Kushi'' Begum from the Martin-Seidel
home at Hoquiam last Friday, declaring it wasn't ``culturally
relevant.''
   Kushi has been placed at least temporarily with her 19-year-old
sister here, whose marriage gave the youngster entry to the United
States.
   Supporters say if she is returned to her remote village she faces
life as a social outcast because of her sexual abuse.
   Martin and Seidel, who have been her foster parents for a year,
had hoped to adopt the girl. But they have been told they cannot
keep her because they are not Moslem and because the natural parents
will not give her up for adoption.
   ``The girl's birth parents want her educated and raised in the
United States but their sect does not believe in adoption and they
have not relinquished their rights,'' Ms. Hopman said.
   ``I'm sure she is bonded to them after the year she has been with
them, but this has to do with family reunification and with cultural
relevancy,'' Ms. Hopman said.
   If the placement with her sister Morshida doesn't work out, three
Moslem families have volunteered their homes, Ms. Hopman said.
   Kushi and her sister did not attend the rally Monday, fearing it
would mean deportation of both, said Lee Terry, who sheltered the
family during the initial investigation. Ms. Terry said Morshida has
major problems of her own to deal with and that the foster parents
would be a better placement.
   Kushi's brother, Sultan, 21, who lives in Seattle, said in an
interview that Kushi's parents don't mind if their daughter stays
with Martin and Seidel.
   ``They say it's O.K. They don't know about this adoption. This
country is very hard. My parents can't understand,'' he said.
   ``They said it's OK if she happy,'' he said.

   About 200 people smashed windows, looted
stores and battled in the streets early today after a protest over
the shooting death of a young black man by police.
   More than 30 people were arrested and at least one person was
hospitalized, police said.
   About 100 state and local police officers in riot gear battled to
regain control of the streets after about 40 buildings were damaged
along about a one-mile stretch of a downtown street.
   Order was restored about 4 a.m., police said. The trouble began
around 11 p.m. Monday.
   ``Things are out of hand,'' Vineland police Lt. Ed Zatzariny said
earlier. ``They're going crazy to retaliate for the shooting.''
   The disturbance was preceded by a march on the police station by
about 100 demonstrators who chanted ``We want justice.''
   Zatzariny said that crowd dispersed, but a few hours later
separate groups of blacks and Hispanics began forming in various
parts of the city and converged on Landis Avenue, the main drag of
the mostly white downtown section of Vineland, a city of about
54,000 about 35 miles south of Philadelphia.
   The group, estimated by Zatzariny at 200, began throwing rocks
and bottles at cars and storefront windows.
   ``There was extensive damage to stores,'' the lieutenant said.
``Windows were knocked out of a few police cars and a lot of
civilian cars were smashed up pretty good.''
   Gary Vasell, a manager of a Seven-Eleven convenience store on
Landis Avenue, said he barely escaped injury.
   ``I was looking through the window and all of a sudden bricks
came flying through,'' Vasell said. ``I started to run out the door
and then more bricks came flying through so I just backed up and
called the cops. I thought maybe somebody was going to start firing
shots. I thought I was going to die.''
   Smaller groups took to sidestreets and caused more damage,
Zatzariny said.
   Several residents in the area scuffled with vandals and some
members of the packs fought with each other, he said.
   The victim of the shooting, Samuel Williams, 26, was killed
Sunday by a white police officer, Paul Letizia, after Williams
reportedly threatened Letizia with a steel rod, police Chief Joseph
P. Cassisi said.
   Officers spotted Williams on Sunday after receiving an anonymous
call about a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, Cassisi said. Williams
had pending arrest warrants on drug and weapon charges, he said.
   Williams allegedly threw two rocks at Letizia when the officer
told him he was under arrest, Cassisi said. He then picked up the
rod and started toward the officer, swinging, Cassisi said.
   ``He threatened to kill the officer,'' Cassisi said, ``The
officer was in fear of his life.''
   The results of an autopsy are still out.
   Samuel L. Clark, president of the Cumberland County chapter of
the NAACP, said Monday's march was prompted by a report in The Daily
Journal of Vineland that quoted Cassisi as saying, ``It was a
justifiable shooting.''
   ``When the newspaper hit the street, all hell broke loose,'' said
Clark. ``We're trying to defuse a very volatile situation.''
   Clark said the city's young officers long have used excessive
force and made racist remarks.
   Vineland's police force, with about 100 officers, has only one
black, Cassisi said.

   Radical students screaming
anti-government slogans today threw firebombs at police and captured
and beat three officers in the southern city of Kwangju, news
reports said.
   The three riot policemen were captured when 1,000 students
battled police at Chonnam University, said Yonhap, the South Korean
news agency.
   About 1,300 then stormed the campus, firing tear gas, Yonhap
said. It said the three policemen were released and taken to a
hospital, and about 10 students were arrested. No further details
were available.
   Rallies demanding the overthrow of the government and the release
of a student charged with illegally visiting Communist North Korea
were held at 17 schools in Seoul and 10 in provincial cities, the
state KBS television said.
   About 700 students in the capital fought riot police with clubs,
rocks and firebombs, news reports said.
   In the southeastern port of Pusan, about 1,000 students wielding
firebombs and rocks clashed with police firing tear gas at Donga
University in a battle that lasted 90 minutes, Yonhap said.
   ``Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' yelled 200 students
hurling firebombs on rain-slick streets outside Seoul's Kyunghee
University. Riot police in combat fatigues fired tear gas to drive
students back inside the campus.
   ``Release Miss Im Su-kyong, flower of unification!'' students
shouted.
   Ms. Im was jailed for an illegal trip to North Korea to promote
national unification. She returned to the South in a much-publicized
border crossing at the Demilitarized Zone Aug. 15. Students at
Seoul's Polytechnic University and Sungkyunkwan University also
demonstrated for her release today, battling riot police.
   About 9,000 riot police surrounded Seoul campuses today to search
for Im Chong-suk, chairman of the National Council of Student
Representatives, who has eluded police for two months.
   Police issued an arrest warrant for Im in connection with the
trip to the North by Ms. Im. The two Ims are not related.
   Ms. Im is in the custody of the national security agency, charged
with violation of national security laws for making an unauthorized
trip to a hostile nation. Police say all those involved with her
trip face punishment.
   The Seoul government maintains that talks on unification of the
divided Korean peninsula must be carried out through official
channels, not by private citizens.
   Radical students and dissidents, a small but vocal minority,
claim the government is insincere in its efforts at dialogue with
North Korea. Radicals also demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact, saying
their presence hinders unification.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and the
capitalist South at the end of World War II in 1945 and the two
nations, which fought a war in 1950-53, remain bitter enemies.

   Six people described as skinheads were
arrested on charges of racial intimidation after an attack on a
15-year-old Hispanic girl, police said.
   The victim suffered cuts and bruises but was not hospitalized
during the attack by several skinheads at a Portland park Monday
evening, Officer Bob Kauffman said.
   Three men were arrested and accused of first-degree racial
intimidation, a felony, and were being held Monday night in the
Justice Center jail.
   Three minors also were charged in the case. A 16-year-old boy was
accused of racial intimidation, and two 16-year-old girls were
accused of third-degree assault. One of the girls also was accused
of wearing a restricted weapon, a spiked wristband.
   Kauffman said the victim and other witnesses told police they
were in the park when the skinheads approached and started yelling
racial slurs at a group that included the Hispanic girl, a Filipino
boy and another girl.
   When the three tried to leave the park, the skinheads ran after
them and attacked the Hispanic girl, whose name was withheld because
of her age.
   A report issued earlier this month by the Metropolitan Human
Relations Commission said 77 crimes involving racial or ethnic
antagonism occurred in Portland from November 1988 to May 1989,
including the murder of Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian man, on Nov. 13.

<HEAD>Dispute Grows Between Rival Afghan Guerrillas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clashes between the two largest groups
of U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas have left 300 people dead, one of
the groups and some independent sources said today. A rival
guerrilla group disputed the claim.
   The battles reflect deteriorating relations among the
Pakistan-based guerrillas, who have yet to capture an Afghan city
since the Soviets withdrew their government-allied forces more than
six months ago.
   Hezb-i-Islami, a fundamentalist Moslem group, said 300 guerrillas
were killed in fighting in northern Afghanistan with the rival
Jamiat-i-Islami group.
   ``We don't have an updated figure, but we know that 100
Hezb-i-Islami mujahedeen (Islamic holy warriors) have died and 200
from Jamiat,'' said a Hezb spokesman identified only as Nasir.
   However, Jamiat, a more liberal Moslem party, called the claim
baseless.
   It said only that its men were holding five Hezb prisoners,
including an important commander.
   ``They were handed over by the local people because they are
criminals,'' said Jamiat spokesman Masoud Khalili.
   ``Something is going on; that's for sure,'' said Naim Majrooh, an
independent Afghan observer in Peshawar, Pakistan. ``Both sides are
involved. It's difficult to believe either one.''
   Fazle Akhbar, another prominent Afghan exile, said his
information indicated between 170 and 200 mujahedeen have died in
the fighting.
   Radio Kabul, the official broadcaster of Afghanistan's Marxist
leaders, has reported at least 556 mujahedeen killed in such clashes
in seven provinces since Aug. 18.
   However, the radio, monitored in Islamabad, is heavily slanted
against the mujahedeen.
   Deep-rooted antagonisms between the two leading guerrilla groups
broke out July 9 in northern Takhar province when Hezb guerrillas
under commander Syed Jamal ambushed and reportedly executed 32
Jamiat men, including several Jamiat commanders.
   Jamiat claims that local Afghans captured Jamal earlier this
month and turned him over to Jamiat's northern commander, Ahmad Shah
Masoud.
   Hezb claims Jamal was captured by pro-government militamen, who
then handed him over to Masoud because Masoud had made some kind of
deal with the Kabul government.
   Since the Takhar clash, the president of the mujahedeens'
self-declared government, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, has publicly
called Hezb's leader, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a ``killer.'' Mojaddidi
is from the small, moderate Afghan National Liberation Front.
   The growing dispute has rocked the rebels' government, which is
composed of Hezb, Jamiat and five other Pakistan-based
anti-government groups.
   The mujahedeen, based mainly in Pakistan and Iran, are fighting
to topple the Kabul government and replace it with a Moslem regime.
   Hard-line parties, such as Hezb and Jamiat, favor fighting for a
military victory. Moderate mujahedeen groups have left the door open
for a negotiated settlement.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power
in a 1978 military coup, touching off the insurgency.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Reports Pirate Attack, Nearly 150 Believed Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old Vietnamese reported that
pirates raided a boat carrying her and about 150 other Vietnamese
refugees, and she believes nearly all the boat people died in the
attack two months ago, police said today.
   Lt. Col. Prakob Benjapong, deputy chief of the Songkhla marine
police, said the teen-ager told him the refugees left Vietnam June
15 in a boat headed for Malaysia.
   He said the teen-ager, whom he identified as Pham Hong Cuc, said
the boat was attacked two days later by two Thai fishing vessels.
   She said two fishermen armed with knives boarded the Vietnamese
boat and robbed its passengers, and then they took her, 10 women,
and three boys aboard their own boats.
   She said the pirates then rammed the Vietnamese boat six or seven
times and sank it. About half of those on board disappeared under
water as soon as the boat went down, she said, and she believes the
rest drowned later.
   The refugee said she and the 10 women were kept on one of the
fishing boats for about a week, raped by five of eight fishermen,
and later thrown overboard.
   She said someone on a passing boat threw her a buoy but refused
to take her aboard. A Thai fishing boat finally brought her ashore
on June 28.
   The police officer said Miss Cuc been living with the family of
one of the fishermen and only recently decided to tell police in the
southern town of Pattani about the attack.
   Prakob said there were no reports about the fate of the other
Vietnamese taken aboard the fishing boats.
   Pirates have been attacking boat people in the Gulf of Thailand
and the South China Sea since the refugees began fleeing their
homeland following the Communist takeover in 1975.
   Prakob said the latest attack was the 48th reported this year.
Police so far have arrested 14 suspects in connection with six other
cases, he said.
   Some officials say most of the pirates are not professional
criminals but fishermen who chance upon the refugee boats and see
them as easy targets.
   Officials say the pirates generally try to kill all refugees so
there will be no witnesses.

<HEAD>Conyers Releases Drug Test Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. John Conyers, who is running for mayor of
Detroit, says a drug test he took after allegations were made about
members of his campaign staff came out negative.
   Conyers showed reporters a toxicological exam showing his urine
sample was free of drugs. The candidate took the test earlier this
month and said Monday that the results showed he was ``clean as the
Board of Health.''
   The congressman originally scoffed at drug tests as a publicity
stunt staged by opponent Tom Barrow, but consented to a test when
charges against his own camp were leveled by former campaign
strategist Sam Riddle.
   Riddle claimed that high-ranking members of the Conyers campaign
were drug users, although Riddle said he never witnessed any drug
use. Conyers has indicated he will not ask his campaign staff to
take drug tests.
   Mayor Coleman Young and Barrow already have taken and passed drug
tests.

<HEAD>Suspect Says Black Teen's Fatal Shooting Was Not Racial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sixth arrest has been made in connection with
the death of a black teen-ager who police said was attacked by a
gang of whites, and tempers appeared to be cooling in the
neighborhood where the attack occurred.
   Police searching for the young man suspected of firing the fatal
shot were reported considering the possibility he might have fled to
Italy. Another young man, who police believe was the leader of the
gang of whites, said the killing was not racially motivated.
   Police said the gang in the mostly Italian neighborhood in
Brooklyn attacked four black youths, who had gone to look at a car
for sale, because they believed the four were going to visit a young
woman who had spurned one of the gang members. A shot was fired and
16-year-old Yusef Hawkins was killed.
   On Monday, Joseph Serrano, 20, surrendered to police and was
charged with first-degree assault, first-degree riot, aggravated
harassment, menacing and civil rights violations, police said. Five
others who had been arrested were released on bail Sunday.
   Also on Monday, there were signs that tempers were cooling off
following two days of racial confrontations.
   About a dozen blacks led about 150 white residents on a short
walk through the streets where the killing occurred. Dozens of
people, angry over a third day of demonstrations in their
neighborhood, stood facing the demonstrators but were quieter and
less confrontational than residents had been Saturday and Sunday.
   The purported group leader, 18-year-old Keith Mondello, told
WABC-TV on Monday that the youths believed the victim was among a
group coming to the Bensonhurst neighborhood to beat up residents.
   ``I was told that 25 blacks were coming to beat me and my friends
up and the only reason the baseball bats were on the scene were
because we wanted to protect ourselves and we didn't know if they
were going to be armed,'' Mondello said.
   Mondello said the attack could have occurred ``no matter what
color they were. If someone was coming to beat me and my friends, we
would do anything to protect ourselves.''
   Police say at least one witness has named 18-year-old Joseph Fama
as the gunman.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that detectives
believe Fama remains in the United States, but are checking to see
if he has fled to Italy. Fama holds dual American and Italian
citizenship.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz must stay in jail
two extra weeks for breaking jailhouse rules by refusing to return a
disposable shaving razor, according to report published today.
   Goetz would have been released Sept. 6, but his release date was
changed to Sept. 20 after he was found guilty in an administrative
hearing in April and later lost an appeal, the Daily News reported.
   ``Inmates are not allowed to keep razors because they could
fashion weapons out of them,'' said Tom Antenen, a Correction
Department spokesman.
   Goetz was sentenced to one year in jail by Judge Stephen Crane
after he was convicted of weapons possession in the shooting of four
black youths on a subway train in December 1984.
   Goetz entered city jails Jan. 13. He has said he believes jail
officials are giving him used shaving razors that may cause him to
contract the AIDS virus.

<HEAD>Local Teacher Strikes in Three States Delay School for 24,000</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Teacher strikes in several small districts in Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Ohio delayed the start of school for more than
24,000 students.
   In eastern Ohio, seven schools opened today in the Indian Creek
Local School District despite a strike by its 180 teachers.
Superintendent Joseph Aguiar said absenteeism appeared to be about
50 percent among the 3,150 students.
   He declined to estimate how many teachers and replacements were
working.
   In the largest school district affected, 550 northeast Ohio
teachers voted to stay away from the scheduled start of class today
for 8,000 pupils in the debt-ridden Warren schools in a dispute over
wages and class size.
   Teachers were demanding a 10 percent pay raise in the third year
of a proposed contract.
   In Pennsylvania, the 192 members of the Big Spring Education
Association in Cumberland County went on strike Monday afternoon,
after talks broke down with the local school board earlier in the
day. The district canceled the first day of classes today for some
3,200 students until further notice. The strike is the first for the
rural district southwest of Harrisburg.
   The 3,700 students in the Upper St. Clair School District in
suburban Pittsburgh were sent home Monday on their first day of
classes, after their 225 teachers went on strike over salaries,
teachers' aides and retirement benefits. School officials said
classes were canceled today for all students except high school
seniors, who are being taught by administrators.
   Teachers also were on strike today in three Michigan school
districts affecting 6,669 students and 316 teachers.
   The Michigan Education Association said bargainers reached
tentative settlements in 10 school districts, leaving 19 with
negotiations at a critical stage and strikes possible.
   Picket lines were up in the 3,468-student Mount Morris district
near Flint after talks broke off Sunday night. The district has 149
teachers.
   Strikes also were on in two Upper Peninsula districts, the
2,001-student Gladstone district with 97 teachers and in Ishpeming
with 1,200 students and 70 teachers.

   The Nobel Peace Prize, which will be
worth $455,000 this year, is to be announced Oct. 5, launching the
1989 Nobel season, officials said today.
   The Baltic nationalist movements and the founder of an
Israeli-Palestinian peace village were known to be among some 100
nominations received by the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian
parliament.
   The Nobel Committee never discloses the names of the candidates,
but those nominating sometimes make their choice public.
   The Peace Prize announcement in Oslo, Norway, will be followed by
the Stockholm announcement of the Nobel prize for medicine on Oct. 9.
   The winner of the economics prize will announced in Stockholm on
Oct. 11, and the winners of the prizes for physics and chemistry
will be announced on Oct. 12, officials said.
   The Swedish Academy, which awards the literary prize,
traditionally keeps the date of its announcement confidential until
a few days in advance. That prize is always announced on a Thursday.
   The prizes will be awarded in ceremonies in Oslo and Stockholm on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1895 death of benefactor Alfred
Nobel.

   Former Rep. Pat Swindall hit the airwaves a few
hours after he was sentenced to a year in prison and tried to
convince skeptical listeners he deserves a new trial to reverse his
perjury conviction.
   Swindall, accompanied by his pregnant wife Kim, appeared Monday
on two television news shows and two radio programs, including a
2{-hour appearance on a radio call-in show. More appearances were
planned this afternoon.
   ``This is not about my political career,'' the 38-year-old
conservative Republican said following his sentencing in federal
court. ``This is not about whether I should be in Congress.
   ``You don't stand by and let the Constitution of the United
States be trashed,'' he said. ``That's why I'm doing it.''
   ``This man violated federal law,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert
Barr. ``He will do time in jail for his misdeeds.''
   As a result of his conviction, the State Bar of Georgia asked the
Georgia Supreme Court late Monday to begin proceedings that could
lead to disbarment of Swindall, an attorney.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman sentenced Swindall to 12
months in prison on each of nine counts of perjury, with the terms
to run concurrently. Freeman also fined Swindall $30,000, plus $450
in court costs.
   Swindall was convicted June 20 of lying to a federal grand jury
last year about negotiations for an $850,000 loan from a federal
agent posing as a money launderer.
   The loan, to help finance Swindall's $1.5 million home in
suburban Stone Mountain, did not go through.
   Swindall, who will remain free while pursuing an appeal, said the
judge's decision to grant him an appeal bond was an indication he
would win a new trial.
   ``All I ask is a fair opportunity to present my case in a fair
court,'' he said.
   Barr, who had sought a sentence of more than three years in
prison, said the government may appeal to obtain a tougher penalty.
   Freeman said the government's sentencing recommendation was
unjustified because prosecutors had not proved Swindall was
personally involved in laundering money.
   In his public appearances, Swindall was alternately righteous and
glib about his situation.
   He told one caller that he was fooled by federal agents posing as
drug-money launderers because ``I'm not used to dealing with
criminals. I may have to get used to it soon.''
   Some callers supported Swindall's claims that he was the victim
of an unfair trial and an overzealous prosecutor, but many others
castigated him for refusing to admit his guilt as decided by the
jury.
   At his sentencing, Swindall gave a 30-minute statement recounting
his reasons for appealing his case, but said he stood before Freeman
``in all humility.''
   The judge disagreed.
   ``You don't know the meaning of humility, Mr. Swindall,'' he
said. ``I thought you were beginning to learn it, but I'm afraid
you're not.''
   Evidence presented at Swindall's trial included tapes of his
conversations with an Internal Revenue Service agent posing as a
money man, and with political supporter Charles LeChasney, who
pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy.
   The conversations continued even after Swindall told the grand
jury he had ``walked away'' from the proposed deal. The congressman
ultimately accepted and endorsed a $150,000 check before backing out.
   Swindall was largely unknown politically before he won the 4th
Congressional District seat in 1984, upsetting veteran Democrat
Elliott Levitas. He was re-elected in 1986 but lost the seat in 1988
to Democrat Ben Jones after being indicted for perjury.
   LeChasney, who testified against Swindall, awaits sentencing.

<TEXT>
   Logging was allowed close to two nests of the
rare northern spotted owl, a U.S. Forest Service biologist testified
at the last of a series of hearings on the bird's status.
   Officials at Siuslaw National Forest in western Oregon recently
allowed logging within 100 yards of two of the 11 breeding pairs
known to exist in the forest, Norm Barrett testified at the hearing
Monday.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service held the hearings to determine
whether to protect the spotted owl as a threatened species.
   ``It worries me that on a forest with only 11 breeding pairs of
owls, they can endanger two of their pairs,'' Barrett said.
   The Fish &amp; Wildlife Service proposed threatened species status
for the owl last June, saying logging in old growth forests in the
Northwest was destroying the bird's habitat.
   The Fish &amp; Wildlife Service has estimated only 1,500 nesting
pairs of northern spotted owls remain in its range from southern
British Columbia to Northern California.
   The timber industry maintains that if the owl is listed as
threatened, thousands of jobs will be lost to preserve old-growth
forests, where the biggest and most valuable timber is found as
habitat for the bird.
   Environmentalists say only 10 percent of the Northwest's ancient
forests remain and the declining numbers of owls signal the
disappearance of an entire ecosystem.
   An estimated 500 people turned out for Monday's hearing, many of
them wearing yellow T-shirts or yellow buttons to show solidarity
with the timber industry.
   The hearing drew nearly 150 speakers, more than earlier Fish &amp;
Wildlife Service hearings in Portland, Ore.; Olympia, Wash.; and
Redding, Calif.
   The majority of the testimony Monday came from timber industry
workers and supporters, who called on the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service to
remember that thousands of jobs are at stake.
   ``Your agency has never before had to consider the listing of a
species which, if listed, would have as catastrophic (an) affect on
people's lives as this one,'' said Ross Mickey, staff forester for
the North West Timber Association in Eugene.
   After a Sept. 21 deadline for public comment, the Fish &amp; Wildlife
Service agency has a year to decide whether to declare the bird a
threatened species.

<HEAD>First Hydrogen Protogalaxy Found</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 3rd graf, The discovery, with Big Bang threory challenged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Science Foundation says
astronomers believe they have stumbled across evidence that galaxies
may still be forming in the universe.
   The evidence is a massive cloud of hydrogen, 10 times larger than
the Milky Way galaxy, all by itself and close by astronomical
standards _ 65 million light-years away, the foundation said Monday.
   The discovery would appear to challenge the current belief that
all galaxies were formed within the first few hundred million years
after the ``Big Bang'' explosion dispersed hydrogen and matter in
the universe.
   The hydrogen cloud was found by Riccardo Giovanelli, adjunct
professor of astronomy at Cornell University and head of the radio
astronomy group at the foundation's National Astronomy and
Ionosphere Center in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and co-worker, Martha
Haynes, associate professor of astronomy at Cornell.
   ``Before stumbling into this thing, neither I nor Martha were
great believers in the existence of such objects,'' Giovanelli said.
   ``But this cloud indicates that the discs of galaxies can form
slowly throughout the history of the universe and not just be
something that happened during some magic period in the distant
past.''
   Giovanelli and Haynes found the cloud while calibrating detectors
attached to the 1,000-foot dish radio telescope at Arecibo. For
calibration, they pointed the dish at a region of the sky thought to
be devoid of objects _ and found the characteristic radio signal of
hydrogen.
   Astronomers believe galaxies, massive groupings of millions to
billions of stars, must form from the condensation of hydrogen, the
simplest element _ a proton accompanied by an electron.
   Previous searches for cloud ``protogalaxies'' had failed to find
anything, though there is strong evidence for the existence of
clouds of hydrogen.
   Light from quasars, incredibly bright objects 10 billion or so
light years away from Earth, was missing frequencies characteristic
of what would be absorbed by hydrogen in its path.
   The cloud emits a strong radio signal, but there are no stars
associated with it, and it does not show up in optical surveys.
   Though 10 times larger than the Milky Way, it has only 10 percent
of the mass of that galaxy and it isn't clear whether the cloud will
evolve into a galaxy, the astronomers said.
   The cloud, south of the Virgo cluster, consists of two large
clumps of gas that may be merging, they said.
   A full report will appear in the Astrophysical Journal.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., is asking the House
ethics committee to investigate his former relationship with a male
prostitute.
   ``Questions have been raised about my employment of a personal
assistant during a period between 1985 to 1987,'' Frank wrote in a
letter to the chairman of the ethics committee. ``I have publicly
responded to these questions, and I have expressed regret for the
mistaken judgment involved.
   ``In order to ensure that the public record is clear, I hereby
request that the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct conduct
an investigation into these matters,'' Frank said in Monday's letter
to committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif.
   House rules require that a member act ``at all times in a manner
which shall reflect creditably on the House.'' The ethics committee
already is looking into cases involving three other members accused
of sexual improprieties.
   Frank pledged to cooperate fully with investigators and asked
that the probe be conducted quickly.
   The liberal Democrat acknowledged Friday that he had paid for sex
with a male prostitute, then hired the man, Steve Gobie, to do
household chores and run errands.
   Saying he was ``victimized,'' Frank said he fired Gobie two years
ago when he became suspicious that Gobie was selling sex from
Frank's Capitol Hill apartment.
   Gobie alleges Frank knew about the prostitution ring at his
apartment. Frank denies that.
   Meanwhile, George Washington University law professor John
Banzhaf said he asked U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens of the District of
Columbia to investigate other charges related to prostitution,
including running a bawdy house and soliciting for prostitution.
   ``Many people don't think Frank confessed to a crime. He has,''
Banzhaf said.
   Frank said that Banzhaf ``is saying is that every gay person in
Washington D.C. who is not totally abstinent is a criminal.'' The
congressman said he didn't think he or anyone else in such a
situation should be prosecuted.
   In another development, Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney S.
Randolph Sengel said today he will file a motion Friday to drop
charges against Democratic political consultant John E. Ashford,
accused of trying to arrange sex with a 13-year-old girl through
Gobie.
   ``After reviewing the case with police, it was our determination
that evidence which we had is not sufficient to sustain the
allegation that Mr. Ashford solicited a crime,'' Sengel said. ``For
that reason we are dismissing the charge.''
   Ashford is scheduled to appear in Alexandria district court
Friday for a closed hearing.
   Frank and fellow Massachusetts Democrat Gerry Studds are the two
House members who have publicly acknowledged they are homosexual.
Frank's announcement came in 1987, and he was overwhelmingly
re-elected to a fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote.
   Two polls published over the weekend showed that voters in
Massachusetts' 4th District still strongly support Frank.
   Frank, 49, made two public appearances in Fall River, Mass., over
the weekend where a few muffled ``boos'' were overwhelmed by
applause and cheers.
   ``I guess it means people think I've done a good job in the
past,'' he said. ``People are being nicer to me than I'm ready to be
to myself right now.''
   Alexander Tennant, executive director of the Massachusetts GOP,
called on Frank to resign.
   ``The Democrats are arguing this is a personal matter. We are
arguing that there is a very serious public matter,'' Tennant said.
   The other three House members being investigated by the ethics
committee are: Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., some of whose former female
staff members allege he sexually harassed them; Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., who allegedly fondled a Peace Corps volunteer while on an
official trip to Zaire in March; and Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens,
R-Ohio, convicted May 30 of contributing to the unruliness of a
minor as a result of alleged sexual intercourse with a teen-age girl.

<HEAD>Deputy Charged In Fatal Shooting of Cookie Salesman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MORGAN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's deputy has been charged
with criminally negligent homicide for shooting a cookie salesman
during a routine traffic stop in front of the salesman's home.
   Morgan County Sheriff's Deputy Dan Probasco, 29, was charged
Monday in Morgan County District Court in the July 15 death of Dan
E. Smith, 36, a salesman for Nabisco.
   Police say Probasco shot Smith in the back of the head after
pulling him over in front of Smith's Fort Morgan home for an
apparent drunken-driving check.
   ``Deputy Probasco's actions...grossly deviated from the standard
of care that a reasonable person in like circumstances and under a
like standard of care would exercise,'' District Attorney Jon Bailey
said at a news conference.
   Probasco has declined to discuss the shooting with investigators,
and has been on paid administrative leave.
   If convicted, the deputy could face one to four years in jail and
a fine ranging to $100,000. Bailey said the jail sentence could be
extended to eight years under exceptional circumstances.
   The shooting has prompted criticism of the sheriff's office by
some Fort Morgan residents, who said the episode epitomized the
sometimes overzealous law enforcement in the county.
   ``It seems to me if there was a shot in the back of the head, it
would be more than negligent,'' said attorney Roger Nixt, who is
representing Smith's estate.
   But Bailey said elements were lacking for the filing of murder
charges.
   Police reports say the shooting occurred after Probasco pulled
Smith's car over and radioed headquarters to verify Smith's license
number and driver's license.
   A transcript of radio transmissions the night of the slaying
showed the sheriff's dispatcher had just acknowledged Probasco's
call when Probasco yelled, ``I need backup.'' The dispatch center
then was unable to contact Probasco on the radio.
   A short time later, a neighbor of Smith's called police to say an
officer had asked her to call for assistance because there had been
a shooting.

   Moldavians today pushed forward in
parliamentary debate on a new draft law to make the local dialect
the official language of the republic, but non-Moldavian strikers
and protesters charged the measure was discriminatory.
   In the restive Baltics, an activist said Monday that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev cautioned Communist Party officials in
Lithuania against pushing too hard for autonomy.
   The legislature of the southern Soviet republic voted 300 to 43
not to delay debate on the bill, despite objections by deputies from
two cities where 80,000 non-Moldavian workers have been striking
since last week to protest the law. Three deputies abstained and 30
were absent.
   The vote on the bill was expected by Wednesday.
   Around Kishinev, capital of this republic on the Romanian border,
viewers watched the session on television in both Russian and
Moldavian, a Romanian dialect.
   The Russians, Ukrainians and other ethnic groups comprise more
than a third of the republic's population.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Monday that ethnic
activists in Moldavia are trying to ``take power on the crest of a
muddy wave of chauvinism and separatism.''
   Moldavian activists said the opera theater where the lawmaking
body was meeting was ringed by police as several hundred people
gathered across the street waving red-blue-and-yellow banners of the
republic's colors.
   Gorbachev called Lithuania's party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, on
Friday and Sunday to express his concern about the independence
movement in the republic, activist Romaldus Olozus said.
   On Saturday, the Communist Party Central Committee in Moscow said
separatists were leading the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia toward trouble. The statement came days after 1 million
Baltic people joined hands in a chain to protest the 1939 agreement
between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler that forced the independent
Baltics in the Soviet sphere of influence.
   Olozus, a member of the governing council of the Sajudis
grassroots movement, said in a telephone interview from Vilnius that
he and four colleagues met with Brazauskas on Monday.
   Brazauskas told the Sajudis members, ``Gorbachev is concerned
about what's happening in Lithuania _ that what had happened so far
was worth supporting, but that now we'd gone too far,'' Olozus said
by telephone.
   No special meeting of Sajudis was planned to discuss the Kremlin
reaction, but Sajudis Chairman Vytautus Landsbergis was scheduled to
speak tonight on Lithanian television, Olozus said.
   Estonian Communist Party chief Vaino Vyalyas said the republic's
party agreed with the Central Committee's assessment that the Baltic
region was in danger of falling into ``an abyss'' if they heeded
separatist calls for secession, Tass reported today.
   The government of Lithuania and the Communist Party of the third
Baltic republic, Latvia, came into line Monday behind the statement
from Moscow.
   The Tass news agency said the Latvian party issued a statement
calling the party's stance ``the basis for concrete action for
normalizing the social-political situation in the country.''
   In Lithuania, the presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet
legislature rejected a commission's findings that the incorporation
of Lithuania into the Soviet Union by Stalin in 1940 was an
``international crime.''
   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, said the findings did
not take into account Lithuania's political situation in 1939-40,
and would ``lead the republic into a political dead-end and serve
poorly in the transfer to economic independence.''
   It returned the Supreme Soviet commission's work until a national
panel finishes its review, Izvestia said.
   Olozus said Gorbachev apparently was upset with the findings of
the Lithuanian commission because they could heighten the legal
argument for full independence.
   Olozus said he had an impression from talking to Brazauskas that
Gorbachev did not entirely support the strident tone of the Central
Committee statement, but that ``his reaction was one of
disappointment.''
   The confrontation with the Kremlin was ``inescapable,'' but the
resistance might slow down the Sajudis-led drive for greater
autonomy, if not outright independence from Moscow, Olozus said.
   The grass-roots movement will continue on the same path, ``but
the steps can be slower or faster, depending on the concrete
situation,'' he said.
   The labor daily Trud today attacked Moldavian nationalists,
saying they ``stepped up bitterness, mutual hostility and
suspicion'' among ethnic groups.
   Representatives of the Moldavian People's Front on Monday met
leaders of a council representing non-Moldavian workers who have
been on strike since last week to protest the draft language law,
Tass reported.
   On Sunday, up to 300,000 people rallied in Kishinev in favor of
the language law.
   Pravda on Monday said that the crowd drawn to Kishinev's Lenin
Square on Sunday by the People's Front had ``submitted to long-term
brainwashing by nationalist-minded ideologists.''
   Non-Moldavians are concerned the language law will be the first
step toward a policy of discriminating against non-Moldavians.

   A bitter, ethnically charged battle between a
Cuban-born state senator and a Jewish lawyer sparked heavy turnout
today as voters went to the polls to pick a successor to the late
Rep. Claude Pepper.
   ``Normally, when the polls open we might have one person waiting
to vote. Today at that time, there were five,'' said Herman
Weissman, a veteran election inspector at one Miami Beach polling
place.
   At 11 a.m., based on initial results from polls, the elections
department was projecting that 42.8 percent of eligible voters would
turn out, far higher than normal for a special election.
   Voting was heaviest in the Cuban-American precints where
Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was strongest, with central Little
Havana residents turning out a projected 77.3 percent clip.
   By contrast, North Miami Beach condominium precincts, where
Democrat Gerald Richman has the advantage, were projected to have a
46.3 percent turnout.
   `It's been a very controversial election,'' Elections Supervisor
David Leahy said. ``There has been a tremendous amount of media
exposure, and we think both camps are getting a lot more people out
to vote.''
   Many Cuban-Americans were upset by the tone of the Richman's
campaign. His early slogan was ``This is an American Seat.''
   Richman's defenders said he had been unfairly labeled as
prejudiced, and said the campaign phrase was merely Richman's answer
to Republican claims that the seat should belong to a Cuban-American.
   The Fair Campaign Practices Committee, an independent panel,
criticized both candidates as appealing to voter prejudice, blasting
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for a Spanish-language brochure that it said made a
veiled ethnic attack on Richman, a Jew.
   ``No, we weren't born in Brooklyn, N.Y., like him. No, we don't
speak English the same way he does ... We, too, are Americans,''
said the brochure. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen has refused to debate Richman,
calling him a bigot.
   She campaigned Monday with Sen. Connie Mack among senior citizens
in Miami Beach _ an area heavily favored to back her Democratic
opponent.
   Richman spent part of the day before the election in Miami Beach,
and also visited with black ministers in Miami.
   Polls last week indicated the race was too close to call and that
most voters in the diverse district would choose ethnic heritage,
not partisanship, at the ballot box.
   The area Pepper represented for 27 years, until his death May 30
at age 88, has 100,149 registered Democrats, 71,295 registered
Republicans and 14,098 independents.
   Blacks make up 19 percent of the district's registered voters.
More than 40 percent of the district's registered voters are
Hispanic, and the rest are non-Latin whites, sometimes known locally
as``Anglos.''
   Richman, 48, the Brooklyn-born former Florida Bar Association
president, hoped for a strong turnout from the traditional
Jewish-retiree-black Democratic coalition, a group that has seen its
traditional power in the area eroded by the Latin influx into South
Florida.
   A large turnout was expected from Cuban-Americans seeking to make
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress.
South Florida also has a growing population of Nicaraguans.
   Leahy said that 7,961 Democrats and 5,965 Republicans had
requested absentee ballots as of the weekend; 4,800 had been
returned by Monday, but no breakdown was available.
   ``This is a unique situation where the parties really encouraged
people to vote absentee ballot and I'm not sure what that will do to
the returns,'' Leahy said.

<TEXT>
   Iran's parliament today approved all 22
nominations to President Hashemi Rafsanjani's new Cabinet, the
country's official news agency reported.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, described
the vote of confidence by the 270-member Majlis as ``unprecedented''
since some members of all previous Cabinet slates had been rejected
in the past.
   The vote came after Rafsanjani got a last-minute boost for his
proposed Cabinet today from radical Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi.
   ``I see Mr. Rafsanjani's Cabinet as a successful one and one that
supports the deprived ... and whose members have worked hard for the
revolution,'' Karrubi was quoted as saying by IRNA.
   He told Parliament, on the third day of a debate on Rafsanjani's
Cabinet: ``It is a Cabinet that has experience, proficiency,
competence and faith with full revolutionary credentials.''
   Earlier, Tehran newspapers had warned that as many as three of
the nominees could be rejected.
   Rafsanjani has come under fire from radicals for dumping their
leaders from his Cabinet. They included outgoing Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who has been closely linked with Shiite Moslem
militants holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Karrubi's support was seen as critical for Rafsanjani, 55, who
was elected by a landslide vote July 28, after two days of debate in
which some of his nominees have incurred severe criticism from
radical deputies.
   Karrubi, a hard-line radical who has advocated the violent spread
of Iran's Islamic revolution, is allied to Rafsanjani's rivals.
   But he apparently has fallen in line with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
Iran's spiritual leader, who last week urged parliamentary deputies
to set aside their differences and approve Rafsanjani's Cabinet to
ensure a smooth transition from the outgoing government of Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi.
   Khamenei was elected to succeed Iran's revolutionary leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3. Karrubi succeeded
Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, as Speaker
last month.
   Rafsanjani's new-look Cabinet includes more technocrats, many of
them Western-educated, than revolutionary ideolgues. He has said his
main priority is to revitalize Iran's sagging economy, battered by
eight years of war with Iraq and a decade of mismanagement.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker complained just
weeks before he resigned in 1987 that he didn't live as well as
other evangelists, a former aide testified today at Bakker's fraud
and conspiracy trial.
   ``We were at ORU (Oral Roberts University) and they were showing
us around,'' David Taggart said. ``Mr. Bakker said that he lived
shabbily compared to Oral Roberts ... and other ministers.''
   Taggart, who was convicted last month of tax evasion, said Bakker
made the comment while they were in Oral Roberts' office in Tulsa,
Okla. The office, he said, ``is about the size of thos courtroom.''
   He also testified that Bakker had become fascinated with real
estate investments and had said he wanted to invest his bonus
payments from PTL in land. ``He told me he wanted to have 10
homes,'' Taggart said.
   Taggart also said the Bakker's parsonage electric bill usually
ran about $1,800 to $2,000 a month because ``the pool was kept at a
very high temperature ... in the 90s.''
   Taggart began his testimony on Monday, the first day of Bakker's
federal court trial. He testified then that the PTL ministry founder
used church money to pay Jessica Hahn to keep silent about their
tryst.
   Taggart said his former boss also used official funds to buy
homes, expensive cars and to finance luxurious trips to seaside
resorts.
   A prosecutor, citing what he called excesses in Bakker's
lifestyle, said on one occasion the minister and his wife bought
$100 worth of cinnamon buns from a bakery because they liked the
aroma, and threw the rolls out from their hotel suite three days
later without eating a single one.
   Bakker is charged with 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy and
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million if
found guilty of all of them.
   Bakker quit PTL in March 1987 amid revelations about his 1980
sexual encounter with church secretary Hahn and a $265,000 payoff to
her. Bakker attorney George T. Davis said the Hahn payment was made
without Bakker's knowledge.
   Taggart said Bakker complained about his salary and told him top
PTL executives diverted funds for their own use.
   ``I remember Mr. Bakker saying he wanted to be paid like Johnny
Carson,'' Taggart testified. ``He said some fund-raisers got up to
10 percent of what they took in.''
   Prosecutors say Bakker and other executives at the evangelical
empire diverted for their own benefit at least $4 million of the
$158 million they raised by selling ``lifetime partnerships'' at the
ministry's resort hotels.
   Davis said his client is innocent and called him a ``creative
religious genius.''
   Bakker didn't ``sell'' anything, Davis said. ``What happened was
gifts or donations. This was a church.''
   Davis blamed problems at PTL on trusted lieutenants and noted
that former PTL vice president Richard Dortch as well as Taggart and
his brother, James, are convicted felons.
   Dortch pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in exchange
for testimony against Bakker. He was sentenced last week to eight
years in prison and fined $200,000.
   David and James Taggart were convicted last month of tax evasion
on money received from the PTL. Each faces 25 years in prison and $1
million in fines at sentencing Sept. 8.
   David Taggart testified that one 1986 document in Bakker's
handwriting suggested in 1986 cutting the ministry's payroll to $10
million from $24 million. Taggart said that same month the PTL board
voted Bakker a $200,000 bonus and a $100,000 bonus for his wife,
Tammy Faye.
   Under Bakker's orders, Taggart said he spent more than $500,000
in PTL money to purchase and decorate a condominium for the Bakker
family in Highland Beach, Fla., in 1982.
   Taggart said Bakker also purchased a $600,000 home in Palm
Springs, Calif., a month before he resigned.
   Bakker had little to say after the day's proceedings.
   ``I'm tired,'' he told reporters.
   Meanwhile, Tammy Faye Bakker carried on with the couple's
television program broadcast from Orlando, Fla., asking viewers to
pray for her husband. She said she wanted to have the ``Jim and
Tammy Show'' on the air so ``Jim will have something to come home
to.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said the ``case is about
cheating people out of their money, tricking people out of their
money by the use of the mails, telephone and television.''
   The money paid for ``a lavish lifestyle most of you won't be able
to identify with,'' Miller said, including $100,000 for a private
jet to take the Bakkers' clothing to California. Miller said the
Bakkers had two Rolls Royces and four Mercedes cars, including one
used only to drive Bakker's 12-year-old son from place to place.
   Miller said the Bakkers bought the cinnamon buns during a trip,
and tossed them out three days later, ``with not a bite taken out of
any of them.''

<HEAD>Bus Blast Kills 12 A Day After Tribal Group Pledges to End Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tribal militants today detonated a bomb
hidden in a bus in northeast India, killing at least 12 passengers a
day after tribal leaders agreed to suspend the campaign of
separatist violence, news reports said.
   The United News of India said the bomb exploded on a state-owned
bus in the state of Assam, where militants from the Bodo tribes have
been fighting for their own state.
   The news agency quoted unidentified officials as saying the bomb
was planted by Bodo militants and left at least 12 people and 35
injured.
   In New Delhi on Monday, Bodo leaders said they had agreed to
temporarily halt their separatist campaign as a result of talks with
federal government officials and the chief minister of Assam state.
   But Upendra Brama, one of the leaders, said the demand for a
separate Bodo state must be met by 1990 or the group would resume
violence.
   The Bodos have been demanding a separate homeland on the northern
bank of River Brahmaputrain in Assam, a remote and hilly state
bordering Bangladesh and Bhutan.
   The Bodos, mostly farmers of Mongol origin, were animists before
they converted earlier this century to Hinduism and Christianity.
They make up about 30 percent of Assam's 20 million people.
   The Bodos claim they suffer discrimination from the Assamese and
accuse them of mass migration to Bodo-dominated land.
   ``We will go to any extent to get our demand for a separate,
full-fledged Bodoland on the northern bank of Brahmaputra River,
implemented by 1990,'' Brahma told reporters in New Delhi after the
talks Monday.
   The violence has seriously affected the economy of the tea- and
timber-growing state.
   ``It is good news that both the sides have agreed to work for
peace and not to encourage violence,'' Assam government spokesman
J.K. Dass said today.
   Dass said that during the talks, the Bodos agreed to stop attacks
on government and in return, the Assam government would not to
invoke special police powers to detain suspects without trial for up
to one year.
   ``From our side, we will stop all actions against the Bodos with
the hope that they will abide by the agreement,'' Dass said. ``But
if they resume their violent campaign, we will use force against
them.''
   The Bodo problem has been simmering for more than 20 years, but
it turned violent earlier this year.
   Bodo leaders claim that 1,500 of their comrades have died in
police actions by the Assam government and that 15,000 houses have
been damaged by Assamese, leaving 100,000 people homeless.
   Dass, however, said only 395 people, including 41 policemen and
16 state officials, had been killed this year.
   In Punjab state, another hub of separatist violence, police said
today that Sikh militants set off a bomb at a railroad track and
closed down the rail line.
   A.K. Sharma, senior police superintendent at Majitha, said at
least six feet of nearby track were destroyed Monday by the bomb,
but no one was injured. He said seven empty train cars derailed when
they approached the damaged track. Sikh radicals have been fighting
for an independent nation in Punjab since 1982. They claim
discrimination by the Hindus, India's religious majority.
   On Sunday, masked Sikh gunmen raided a passenger train in Punjab
and massacred at least 22 Hindu passengers.

   A woman was sentenced to life in prison today for
giving her daughter to a rapist in exchange for drugs.
   Wayne County Circuit Court Judge James J. Rashid told Susan
Barbier, 29, that she had ``sunk to an intolerable level of
humanity'' in the May 1988 indident, for which she was convicted of
first-degree criminal sexual conduct.
   Rashid exceeded the sentencing guidelines, which called for 10 to
25 years in prison, saying Barbier has ``very little, if any at all,
potential for reformation.''
   Barbier gave her 13-year-old daughter over to Anthony Sawyer, who
raped the girl, then left the child alone while she went to get high
with Sawyer, police and court records showed.
   Sawyer, who had two previous rape convictions, was sentenced last
week to 40 to 60 years in prison for raping Barbier's daughter.

   A casino under construction on an
American Indian reservation was set aflame by residents opposed to
gambling parlors on Indian territory, witnesses say.
   A power transformer was shot out near two other casinos on the
St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, where pro- and anti-gambling forces
have clashed since a gambling raid last month, state police said
today.
   Power was restored to the Bear's Den and Tony's Vegas
International by 5:30 a.m. today, said Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
district manager David Werner. No homes were affected, he said.
   Troopers were investigating the incident, which occurred about 11
p.m. Monday, but no arrests had been made, according to a state
police spokesman who would not give his name.
   The Lucky Knight Casino, which was scheduled to open today, was
heavily damaged in the fire Sunday night after a confrontation
between a pro- and anti-gambling factions. A brief standoff between
the Warriors Society, a self-appointed reservation security force,
and state police followed the disturbance.
   Casino owner Victoria Adams said she had just left the building
when a mob stormed it and set the fire with Molotov cocktails. She
said the mob tried to burn other casinos but armed guards stopped
them.
   State police, in a statement, said the conflict at the casino
involved more than 500 people and lasted about six hours.
   While state troopers set up roadblocks to route traffic around
the reservation, Warriors Society members, expecting state police to
intervene, set up their own armed checkpoints just inside the
reservation.
   After several tense hours, both sides relinquished their
respective strongholds along the perimeter of the reservation, which
straddles the U.S.-Canadian border in northern New York.
   The reservation was the site of a 10-day standoff between
troopers and Indians after a gambling raid July 20 by state and
federal authorities. Mohawks voted this month to permit gambling on
the reservation, but some Indians claim the vote was invalid.
   State police and tribal leaders reached an agreement this month
to resume patrols on the reservation, but the Warriors Society has
said they would allow troopers on their land only with advance
notice and escorts.
   Although casino gambling is illegal in New York state, the
reservation's seven casinos offer slot machines and card games that
attract gamblers from both sides of the border. The Mohawks contend
they are not bound by state or federal gambling laws since they
consider their reservation a sovereign nation.

   A group of artists says it wants to
enlighten, not offend, with a show on the U.S. flag that includes a
painting of the Statue of Liberty giving a Nazi salute against the
backdrop of an American banner.
   The 10 artists _ students and former students at Jersey City
State College _ are exhibiting their works in a month-long show
opening Sept. 12 called ``Flagging Our Freedom.'' The exhibit in a
campus gallery is funded by a campus literary magazine and has the
support of the chairman of the art department.
   The exhibit is motivated by proposed laws against flag
desecration and by the threat of the government withdrawing money
for art considered offensive.
   ``By no means are we trying to do shock art,'' organizer Orlando
R. Cuevas said. ``We're trying to do good art.''
   Oroc, an artist who goes by the one name, had a piece among those
previewed Monday.
   In his oil painting ``21st Century America,'' a grimacing Statue
of Liberty makes a Nazi salute. A swastika is painted on the tablet
on her arm, and pennies reading ``In Dog We Trust'' cover her
breasts. Behind her is a wrinkled, backwards American flag and the
corner of a dollar bill.
   Christ is crucified on the ``one'' of the bill.
   ``To me the Statue of Liberty is really a joke,'' said Oroc, a
24-year-old Union City resident. The work's message is that the
nation celebrates freedom but tolerates racism, homelessness,
exclusion of immigrants and worship of wealth, he said.
   Cuevas' contribution is a multi-media sculpture inside half a
cat-carrying box. What appears to be a row of toy soldiers marches
on top of a flag. A doll's head lies in back, its arm poking through
the row of soldiers.
   ``The Big Parade'' is an anti-war statement, and the flag
represents ``mainstream America,'' said Cuevas, 25, of Jersey City.
   The artists have a range of opinions over proper treatment of the
flag but agree their right to use it to express themselves should
not be limited, he said.
   They are reacting in part to a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision
protecting flag burning as free speech. The students also said they
were reacting to cuts of federal grants by the U.S. House to museums
that sponsored the controversial work of photographers Robert
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.
   A spokesman for the state Veterans of Foreign Wars, which favors
a constitutional amendment against flag burning, said he would
reserve judgment on the show.
   ``It all depends on the works of art they're displayng,'' said
Willis Bird in Trenton.
   ``I absolutely do support the show,'' said art department
chairwoman Dorothy Dierks Harris. Of the students, she said, ``I
think they are rather exceptional.''

   A rusting torpedo was found floating near
this popular eastern Aegean resort island Tuesday and was towed to a
deserted beach, the Merchant Marine Ministry said.
   The 11{-foot-long torpedo, apparently from World War II, bore no
identifying marks, said ministry spokesman Andreas Kefalas.
   It was spotted by passengers on a pleasure craft sailing about
550 yards off Rhodes' northern coast.
   It was towed by harbor police to the island and army bomb
disposal experts were called in to defuse it, Kefalas said.
   Rhodes, part of the Dodecanese group of islands, was under
Italian and Nazi occupation during World War II.

<TEXT>
   The head of Hungary's intelligence
service said in an interview published Tuesday that the Communist
Party no longer controls his organization.
   Police Brig. Gen. Jozsef Horvath told the Magyar Nemzet newspaper
that situation reports no longer are being given to leading members
of the party, and ``only state leaders are entitled to this right.''
   The formal transfer of control from the Communist Party to the
government has had little practial effect, however, because all
government leaders are also ranking Communists.
   After endorsing the concept of multiparty democracy in February,
the reform-minded communist leadership began transfering to the
government formal supervisory rights to organizations it had
traditionally controlled, including the armed forces and the police.
   The moves are in preparation for free parliamentary elections
next year.

   The European Economic Community said
Tuesday it has begun sending 10,000 tons of beef to Poland as part
of an emergency food aid program.
   The shipments will run through Oct. 8.
   The EEC has agreed to send $120 million in meat, grains and other
foodstuffs as part of a larger assistance program involving two
dozen nations.
   On Aug. 1, 130 officials from 24 nations met at the EEC
headquarters to assess the needs of Poland and Hungary and make
Western assistance available.
   At the July 14-16 economic summit of the world's seven largest
industrialized nations in Paris, the EEC was asked to coordinate aid
to the two nations to encourage economic and political reforms.
   Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski told the EEC his country
needs at least 685,000 tons of beef, pork, powdered milk, butter,
oils, wheat, corn, rice and sugar in the coming months.

   One of Leona Helmsley's bodyguards went to the
hotel where jurors in her tax evasion trial are sequestered and rode
an elevator with one juror, according to court papers.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr., concerned by newspaper
reports on the incident, said today that there was an ``innocent
explanation'' for the incident that satisfied both the court and
government.
   Walker did not reveal why the unidentified bodyguard was in the
hotel in Manhattan on Friday night. The explanation is contained in
other court papers still under seal, he said.
   The incident was first reported in today's editions of The New
York Post and New York Newsday. Walker said the court transcripts
obtained by the newspapers were ``inadvertently'' unsealed.
   In the court papers from Saturday, Walker told Mrs. Helmsley's
lawyer, Gerald Feffer, to ``convey to his client to tell her people
to stay out of the hotel'' where the jury was staying.
   ``Needless to say, this is not a Helmsley hotel,'' Walker said.
   The jury began its fourth day of deliberations today in Mrs.
Helmsley's federal court trial. She is charged with 47 counts of tax
evasion and extortion for allegedly charging personal expenses to
her businesses.

<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge with a penchant for creative
sentences has ordered nearly 100 traffic offenders to watch a TV
special on safe driving.
   ``We have a nice group of youthful offenders who come from the
upper economic strata. Fining them 40 or 50 bucks isn't going to do
anything,'' said Robert Manchester, a judge in the suburban enclave
The Village.
   The judge said he had ordered 75 to 100 offenders to watch
Tuesday night's ``Valvoline National Driving Test'' on CBS. The
25-question test will cover defensive driving, rules of the road and
basic mechanics.
   Offenders must return their completed test booklets to the
48-year-old judge, who used to race motorcycles and subscribes to
Hot Rod magazine.
   It's not the first time Manchester has handed out an unusual
punishment in the city of 12,000.
   ``I have required kids to do the family laundry,'' Manchester
said. ``One of my favorite things is, if I have a young offender who
is driving a fairly new car, I check to see whether the parents
bought it. If they did, I have the offender wash and wax the
parents' car.''
   Other offenders have been required to write reports. Some had to
interview the police officer who made the arrest ``so they'll know
that officer is human and not some cretin just trying to stop their
fun,'' he said.
   ``I've had them interview doctors or nurses in emergency rooms,''
the judge said. ``What is trauma? How much pressure does it take to
snap a neck, to turn someone into a quadriplegic?''
   Then there was the teen-ager who said he was driving fast to make
the heater come on more quickly.
   ``I had him do a report on how a cooling system functions,''
Manchester said. ``He came back in and said, `That was really silly
of me, wasn't it?' I said, `Yes, but I could have told you that and
you wouldn't have understood me.'''

<TEXT>
   There was ``mass confusion'' in Salem
last year after 13 bombs were stashed around the southern Indiana
town, local law enforcement officials testified today.
   ``We felt like we were dealing with something we didn't know too
much about,'' Fire Chief Larry Cooper testified at the trial of
Jerry A. Conrad, 42, one of two men accused of planting the bombs.
   The prosecutor in the U.S. District Court trial, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Robert Stanley Powell, said in his opening statement Monday
that the town ``was paralyzed'' by the attempted bombings on July 5,
1988.
   But defense attorney Michael McDaniel said Conrad was an honest,
law-abiding citizen and a family man. ``He's never been in trouble
with the law,'' McDaniel said.
   In today's testimony, Police Chief Max Boling said authorities
cordoned off downtown streets for about 12 hours while teams
searched for more bombs.
   ``Nobody could understand what was going on. There was mass
confusion for a while as to why they couldn't drive through town,''
Boling said.
   Conrad and John M. Hubbard III, 31, of Salem are accused of
planting dynamite bombs under bridges and behind buildings in the
town nearly 30 miles northwest of New Albany on July 5, 1988. Three
of the bombs ignited and fizzled, but none exploded and no one was
hurt.
   The bombs were allegedly targeted at state Rep. Frank Newkirk Jr.
Authorities declined to comment on a motive, but a criminal
complaint called Hubbard a ``lifelong rival'' of Newkirk, who is
also the son of Salem's mayor.
   Conrad and Hubbard, who worked at the same factory, were arrested
last May and indicted on one count of unlawful possession of
dynamite, one count of conspiracy, 14 counts of making bombs and 13
of attempting to destroy roads and buildings affecting interstate
commerce.
   If convicted, Conrad could be sentenced to up to 285 years in
prison. Hubbard is to be tried after Conrad.
   Powell said evidence would show that Conrad, a technical
engineer, helped Hubbard make the bombs and that the tools used to
make them belonged to Conrad.
   Powell cautioned that much of the government's case was based on
circumstantial evidence.
   ``Don't expect somebody to come up and say they saw them making
the devices,'' Powell said.
   McDaniel said that Conrad would not dispute allegations he told
Hubbard various things about making bombs, but would deny any
involvement in a plot to blow up Salem.
   ``The evidence will show he knew how to make bombs,'' McDaniel
said. ``He is a survivalist. He wants to be self-sufficient in the
event of a nuclear war. He wants to be able to sustain himself, his
family.''
   McDaniel said such people are not part of a ``lunatic fringe''
simply because they are concerned about their future and their
family's safety.
   Conrad, who wore a dark suit and tie, sat quietly at a table in
the courtroom, taking notes on a yellow legal pad.

<HEAD>Couple Claims Richest Lotto Prize to a Single Winner in Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban couple came forward today to claim a
$42 million Lotto jackpot, the richest prize to a single-ticket
winner in Illinois State Lottery history.
   William and Kathleen Madigan, who formed the Madigan Partnership
to claim the prize, will receive 20 annual payments of $2.1 million,
officials said at a news conference.
   The Madigans, who live in Hometown, a southern suburb of Chicago,
bought their ticket for Saturday's Lotto drawing at a White Hen
Pantry in suburban Oak Lawn. The convenience store will receive
$420,000, 1 percent of their winnings, lottery officials said.
   Mike Wittkowski, a Chicago printer who was a 1984 Lotto winner,
held the previous state single-jackpot record of $40 million.
   The state's biggest jackpot ever was $69.9 million for the April
15 drawing this year, but the cash in that grand-prize pool was
divided four ways.
   The winner of the largest undivided lottery prize in the United
States was Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, Fla., who won $55.16
million in the Florida lottery on Sept. 3, 1988.
   Players in the Illinois Lottery select six numbers from 1 to 54.
A $1 ticket buys two plays. The winning numbers drawn Saturday night
were 6, 9, 33, 40, 51, 54.

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners today shelled a tanker
carrying fuel for Lebanon's besieged Christians, setting it on fire
and killing seven crewmen, police reported.
   Two Lebanese crewmen were wounded and rescued by coast guard
vessels. Two others were missing and feared dead.
   The seven victims, including Lebanese captain Johannes
Garabedian, were washed ashore on the coastal strip held by the
Christians several hours after the Maltese-flag tanker was hit,
police reported.
   The incident touched off a fierce five-hour artillery battle
between the Syrians and the Christian forces of Gen. Michel Aoun in
and around divided Beirut. Police said three people were killed and
16 wounded in the barrage, which dwindled to intermittent mortar and
machine gun exchanges by 8:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EDT).
   That raised the casualty toll since fighting erupted March 8 to
at least 795 people killed and 2,263 wounded.
   Police said only two Lebanese among 11 crewmen aboard were
rescued. One of the survivors, Hanna Saddiq, said the tanker was
attacked with missiles by ``a Syrian gunboat'' enforcing the
5-month-old blockade off the Christian-held coast during the night.
   But a police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the ship was shelled by radar-controlled Syrian
howitzers deployed along the seafront in Moslem west Beirut.
   Syrian artillery batteries along west Beirut's seafront also
fired on Aoun's positions and the shelling quickly spread to
residential districts, police reported.
   Police said the ship, identified as the Sunshield, was hit at
least once by radar-guided artillery about seven miles off
Maameltein, an area 11 miles north of this war-torn capital.
   The crew included five Lebanese, four Egyptians and two
Ghanaians. Police said only three of the bodies, all Lebanese, were
identified.
   Saddiq, 24, told reporters at the Hotel Dieu Hospital in
Christian east Beirut, where he was being treated for severe burns,
that a Syrian gunboat approached to within 10 yards around 2:20 a.m.
   The police spokesman said he had no information on the ship's
tonnage, registry or owners.
   He said the Sunshield was carrying 550,000 gallons of gasoline
purchased by the Christian government headed by Aoun, which is vying
for power with a rival Syrian-backed Moslem Cabinet.
   A tugboat succeeded in getting a line on the burning ship early
today and towed it to within a half-mile of the coast as
firefighters battled to extinguish the blaze, the spokesman reported.
   Dozens of ships have managed to evade a Syrian blockade to
deliver weapons and other supplies in recent weeks, but there is a
critical shortage of gasoline and other fuel in the enclave.
   About 1 million residents live in the enclave.
   Seven other cargo ships attempting to run the blockade have been
hit by the Syrians since March 16. At least two seamen have been
killed.
   Syrian gunners have also daily shelled the Christian port of
Jounieh, north of Beirut, seeking to sever the sea link with
Mediterranean island of Cyprus, 100 miles to the northeast. Jounieh
is the enclave's main port.
   The fighting flared today as French envoy Francois Scheer,
Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry in Paris, was expected to
arrive in Beirut for talks with Christian and Moslem leaders in a
new peace effort to halt the bloodletting.
   Scheer has been in Damascus, the Syrian capital, since Sunday
meeting Syrian leaders following the collapse of Arab League
mediation efforts.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League mandate to halt Lebanon's civil war, which erupted in April
1975.
   Syria, which considers Lebanon within its sphere of influence and
vital to its security, backs demands by Lebanon's Moslem and
leftists for an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant
Christians.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, has accepted to negotiate political
reforms. But he has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive
Syria's troops out of the predominantly Moslem sectors they have
controlled since 1976.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders charge that the Syrians
abrogated their Arab League peacekeeping mandate by openly siding
with the Moslems in the 14-year-old civil war, in which more than
150,000 people have been killed.

   An Italian satellite launched to collect data on the
stars has failed to reach orbit, and authorities are prepared to ask
European space authorities for funding for a second satellite, an
official said Tuesday.
   The Hipparcos 1 satellite did not have enough thrust to reach
orbit, said Learco Saporito, undersecretary of the Ministry of
Scientific Research.
   Authorities had tried to start the motor of Hipparcos five times
since the Aug. 8 launch, but failed each time, he said.
   The satellite, built by French and Italian companies, was to take
measurements of about 400 stars to help calculate the dimensions of
the universe, said Luciano Guerriero, president of the Italian space
agency.
   The information was to have been integrated with observations
from the U.S. space telescope, which is scheduled to be launched
soon.
   Saporito said the Italian government, its space agency, the
scientific community and the interested companies are inclined to
ask the European Space Agency to build a new satellite. He did not
provide details.

<TEXT>
   About 15 tons of security files kept
on citizens were destroyed in a blast furnace Tuesday in a symbolic
act marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the Greek Civil War.
   As the files were dropped into the main furnace of a steel mill
13 miles northwest of Athens, flames shot upward and scattered
cinders throughout the plant.
   The cinders were the remains of dossiers on the activities and
political leanings of millions of Greeks considered a threat to the
state since 1944.
   Government spokesman Athanassios Kanellopoulos said former
Premier Andreas Papandreou and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement
had added to the files by keeping records on citizens from 1982-87.
   Papandreou, who was defeated in the June 18 general election, had
pledged that all the security files would be destroyed. The
government said he had failed to fulfill his promise during his
tenure.
   Last week, the government announced that 16.5 million files would
be burned to mark the end of divisions between left and right that
followed the Communist Party's defeat in the three-year uprising.
   The Civil War ended unofficially on Aug. 29, 1949, when all
hostilities stopped between the Communists and government forces
backed by the United States and Britain.
   ``I think that all Greeks wanted to see the end of these relics
of the Civil War,'' said Public Order Ministry general secretary
Mihalis Koutelidakis.
   The decision to destroy the files was made by Premier Tzannis
Tzannetakis, who heads a government comprising the conservative New
Democracy party and the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and
Progress.
   The coalition government said its main task before calling new
elections by the end of October would be to investigate scandals
allegedly perpetrated by the socialists and to pass legislation
leading to conciliation among Greeks.
   The destruction of the files met some opposition from citizens
and politicians.
   About 50 people, mostly supporters of the Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, gathered at the gates of the steelworks and tried to block
police trucks with the files.
   ``A nation which has no memory has no history!'' they chanted.
   Panhellenic Socialist Movement deputies, the Athens University
council and Justice Minister Fotis Kouvelis, a member of the leftist
Coalition, opposed burning the files, saying they were important
documents that should be kept in archives for research.
   ``Whether or not the files are of historical value should be
decided by historians, and should not be sacrificed for the sake of
any symbolism,'' the university council said Monday.
   The government said that about 2,000 files on people who played a
major role in the history of Greece would be preserved.

<TEXT>
   Delegates to a peace conference canceled a formal
meeting planned for today, and a French official said warring
Cambodian groups might wait until next year before they negotiate
again.
   Representatives of the 19 nations spent the day working
informally in small groups, then planned a working dinner followed
by further consultations on the issues that have blocked a
settlement in the monthlong conference.
   The formal session was postponed several times before finally
being rescheduled for Wednesday.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with department practice, said the conference would conclude
Wednesday with a short statement that probably would recommend a
reconvening the conference in Paris several months from now,
``perhaps in the spring.''
   The spokesman said there was ``no movement on the part of the
Cambodian parties'' on two essential points _ composition of a
proposed transitional government and an international mechanism for
monitoring withdrawal of Vietnamese troops this month.
   ``It's too early for a compromise,'' he said.
   A senior U.S. official predicted today that the conference would
be suspended, and a new round of fighting would follow.
   ``We see indications that we may be in for this period of
military testing,'' the official told reporters, speaking on
condition he not be further identified.
   The official suggested the conference could close, ``leaving
open-ended the prospect of reconvening ... some months down the road
when perhaps the realities on the ground have given people a clearer
sense of the real balance of forces at play here.''
   Fourteen foreign ministers present at the first session in late
July have returned to Paris, but China's Foreign Minister Qian
Quichen, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III did not return because no
resolution was in sight.
   Nineteen nations originally attended the conference with high
hopes of laying the foundations for a lasting peace in Cambodia,
which has suffered two decades of civil war and slaughter. But no
progress has been made in three weeks of working meetings.
   Some delegates said positions seem to have hardened among the
Cambodian parties _ the Vietnamese-installed government of Prime
Minister Hun Sen and the three-party resistance led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's ruler until 1970.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw the last of its forces by Sept.
27 with or without a settlement.
   The greatest obstacle remains the role of the Khmer Rouge,
strongest of the resistance factions and responsible for the deaths
of an estimated 1 million civilians due to purges or starvation from
1975 until its ouster by Vietnamese forces in 1978.
   The Khmer Rouge regime came to power by defeating the U.S.-backed
Cambodian government.
   Sihanouk, Cambodia's heriditary ruler, says he would rather share
power with the Khmer Rouge than fight it in the jungles, while Hun
Sen says the group must be eliminated politically and militarily.
   ``There is a limit to which the rest of the world can impose a
solution on the Cambodians,'' a weary Australian Foreign Minister
Garth Evans said at the close of Monday's session.

   ``Steel Wheels'' (CBS) _ The Rolling Stones
   
   ``There's the sun, the moon, the trees and the Rolling Stones,''
Keith Richards says in describing the longevity that is the secret
to this band's success.
   The Stones' new album, ``Steel Wheels,'' is as reassuring _ and
predictable _ as the sun and the moon.
   The Rolling Stones, whose raunchy, guitar-based sound is the most
instantly identifiable signature in rock music, sound simply
terrific. Richards and Ron Woods' guitar playing is exemplary, and
the rhythm section of Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman sounds inspired.
Even Mick Jagger, for all his whining about the need to do solo
work, is undeniably more at home here than anywhere else.
   Thankfully, the Stones vary the output enough to keep ``Steel
Wheels'' from lapsing into the boredom of the band's more recent
records, particularly ``Dirty Work.'' The 12-song album contains
three ballads, a blues song and the exotic sounding ``Continental
Drift,'' which feature Moroccan drummers.
   Where the Stones stumble is in the lyrics. They rarely rise above
the pedestrian and are occasionally insipid.
   For every rare, offhand funny lyric (``So get off the fence, it's
creasing your butt''), there's about a dozen nagging cliches. After
34 albums, the Stones should know enough to avoid such lines as, ``I
can feel your tongue on mine, silky smooth like wine. I'm living
with these memories, that's all that's left of you and me.''
   Jagger's yowl, which renders much of the words indistinguishable
anyway, is the signal that words aren't the most important thing for
this band.
   The individual cuts: The opening ``Sad Sad Sad'' is a rocker in
the classic Stones mold. The single ``Mixed Emotions'' is most
interesting for armchair psychologists who want to apply the line
``you're not the only one with mixed emotions'' to the recent
feuding between Mick and Keith.
   ``Terrifying'' is a series of animal metaphors attached to a beat
that recalls the 1970s ``Hot Stuff.'' ``Hold on to Your Hat'' is the
sort of angry, ``get out of my life, witch,'' song that the Stones
have been writing too much of lately, though Watts makes this tune
with a strong shuffle beat.
   ``Blinded by Love'' is a pleasing country ballad that's sort of a
cross between ``Lady Jane'' and ``Faraway Eyes.''
   ``Rock and a Hard Place,'' with horns integrated into the
traditional rock sound, is one of those songs that sound better if
you don't pay attention to the lyrics. ``Put on a kind face'' is
Jagger's brief advice for such problems as human rights, war and the
homeless.
   Both of Richards' lead vocals, ``Can't Be Seen'' and ``Slipping
Away'' are somewhat slight. Jagger's ballad, ``Almost Hear You
Sigh,'' is, again, lyrically problematic but pleasant sounding.
   ``Continental Drift,'' with the raucous Master Musicians of
Jajouka, is the kind of strange experimentation that shows how the
Stones are still better, when they want to be, than the legions of
bands that try to imitate them.
   The verdict: ``Steel Wheels'' is no masterpiece, but it gives
more evidence why the Rolling Stones are Hall of Fame members.

<TEXT>
   Seven bombs apparently set by drug
traffickers exploded early today, police said. The father of three
reputed drug lords called for negotiations with the government to
end drug-related violence.
   In Washington, Colombia's justice minister, Monica de Greiff,
today pledged to stay in her job and continue fighting her country's
drug lords despite death threats, and she appealed for more U.S. aid
to protect judges.
   There were no injuries in the bombings of six state liquor stores
in Medellin and a travel agency in Bogota, police said, but $100,000
of damage was caused. The bomb in Bogota blew up about 300 feet from
a military base.
   Police blamed drug traffickers for the bombs, which went off
between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. Police also blamed traffickers Sunday for
nine bombings of banks in Medellin. There were no claims of
responsibility.
   Fabio Ochoa Restrepo, father of the reputed Medellin cartel
leaders Jorge, Juan David and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez, asked President
Virgilio Barco to ``end the blood-letting in our dear Colombia'' by
negotiating with drug traffickers to end the violence.
   ``No more drug trafficking, no more war, no more assassinations,
no more bombs,'' Ochoa Restrepo said in his message, which was dated
Saturday and printed in local newspapers today.
   Ochoa Restrepo said drug traffickers are willing to negotiate for
peace, but similar initiatives must be made by the government,
leftist guerrillas and paramilitary groups.
   Leftists groups often attack drug traffickers' extensive property
holdings inside Colombia.
   Ochoa Restrepo said a dialogue with the government was a
condition for peace, and he asked the government for ``forgiveness''
of the traffickers, but did not elaborate.
   Ochoa Restrepo's three sons are among 12 people wanted by the
United States on charges linked to the Medellin cartel, which
enforcement agents believe is responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine distributed in the United States.
   Barco, who began the unprecedented war on traffickers after the
assassination of a leading presidential contender on Aug. 18, has
refused all calls for negotiations with traffickers.
   Mrs. de Greiff, in the Washington news conference, disputed
widespread reports that she considered resigning in the face of
death threats against her, her husband and the couple's 3-year-old
son.
   The 32-year-old justice minister also said she was requesting $19
million in U.S. aid to purchase armored cars, bulletproof vests,
metal detectors for court houses and other security devices to
protect the jurists.
   A Bogota city councilwoman today said the government can win the
war on drugs but must first get rid of police and government
officials tied to the drug traffickers.
   ``The government has to take very definite action ... to purify
it of those people who are in alliance with the criminals that the
government and society is hoping to take to justice,'' said Clara
Lopez Obregon, whose name has appeared on a death list by the drug
lords.
   ``Colombia cannot continue living in this bloodbath,'' she told
CBS ``This Morning'' from Bogota.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara met privately Monday with
Colombia's foreign minister to formally request extradition of a key
narcotics trafficking suspect. In Washington, Colombia's justice
minister and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh discussed extradition
and millions of dollars of U.S. aid.
   In Jerusalem, police on Monday questioned two former Israeli
military officers about reports they trained gunmen for Colombian
cocaine bosses.
   The Washington Post, quoting a confidential report by Colombian
security forces, reported today that at least five Israeli and 11
British mercenaries helped train teams of assassins for Colombian
cocaine traffickers and their right-wing allies.
   The army on Monday announced Abraham Majuat, identified as a top
financial man for drug dealers, was detained last week at a ranch
not far from Medellin. Authorities also seized about 4.5 tons of
cocaine there, about 1 percent of Colombia's yearly production,
according to U.S. narcotics officials.
   Army officials said Majuat is wanted in the United States. If so,
he would be at least the fourth potentially extraditable suspect to
be caught up in the nationwide sweep since Aug. 18.
   Foreign Ministry officials said McNamara and Foreign Minister
Julio Londono Paredes met for 20 minutes Monday to discuss
re-establishing a system of quotas for exports of coffee, once
Colombia's principal cash product. But a meeting between the two was
required to formally request the extradition of Eduardo Martinez
Romero, an alleged finance chief for the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Martinez is wanted by a federal court in Atlanta in connection
with a $1.2 billion money-laundering operation.
   As part of the crackdown, Colombia renewed its extradition treaty
with the United States, which had been nullified by the Supreme
Court in June 1987.
   Barco, in a videotaped message sent to U.S. networks Monday,
called on rich countries to crack down on illicit drug use.
   ``Colombia's survival as the oldest democracy in Latin America is
now at risk, but so is the safety of your streets,'' he said. ``What
might seem to be a matter of purely personal habit has had explosive
public consequences. It has thrown us all into a war we did not ask
for.''

   Tinseltown is ready to write a new ending
to the story of Hollywood vs. Hollywoods.
   The Movie Capital of the World, which got rotten reviews from
other Hollywoods across the nation when it tried to gain exclusive
rights to the name they share, came up with a new offer Monday.
   Tinseltown had tried to trademark the name Hollywood, which would
have barred other Hollywoods from using their name in commercial
ventures outside their cities unless they paid royalties to their
California counterpart.
   The Chamber of Commerce of Hollywood, Calif., is now offering to
drop its application if Florida's Hollywood lets it trademark logos
that reflect Tinseltown, such as the famed hillside Hollywood sign.
   Hollywood, Fla., Mayor Mara Giulianti was optimistic an agreement
could be reached.
   Her city had convened a summit of officials from the nation's
Hollywoods in February and filed a formal protest with the U.S.
Trademark Appeals Board against allowing Hollywood, Calif., to gain
exclusive rights to the name.
   ``We haven't ended the war yet,'' Ms. Giulianti said Monday,
``but we have started the peace talks.''
   Russ Dover, who represented Hollywood, Ga., population 800,
during the February summit, also greeted the California chamber's
offer.
   ``That's good and smart of them,'' said Dover. ``Maybe they have
opened up their eyes and ears and listened to us.''

<HEAD>EPA Plans to Continue Veto Process for Dam, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Environmental Protection Agency administrator
has recommended upholding a veto of the controversial Two Forks Dam
project, officials in Colorado and Nebraska said today.
   Denver has sought the dam on the South Platte River to provide
for the city's future water needs, but conservationists and
Nebraskans have blasted the project as environmentally disastrous.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Tom Gleason, an aide to Denver Mayor
Federico Pena, both said they learned this morning of the decision
by EPA Regional Administrator Lee DeHihns.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly announced his intention to veto
the project last spring and appointed DeHihns to make a final study
and issue a recommendation.
   The project still faces public hearings before a final EPA
decision is made.
   Kerrey said DeHihns based his decision on potential damage to
fish, wildlife and recreation in Colorado and fish and wildlife in
Nebraska. Kerrey also said the EPA didn't agree with Denver's water
need projections.
   ``They didn't believe the Denver Water Board had assembled
numbers that supported their need,'' he said.
   Gleason declined to discuss details of the decision, but said,
``We did find some serious shortcomings in their rationale.''
   Gleason said DeHihns, who has been reviewing the project for the
past 4{ months, briefed Pena and members of the Denver Water Board
on the agency's rationale.
   Rich Lathrop, an EPA spokesman in Denver, declined comment on the
reports and said the EPA's official announcement was to be made
later today.
   The 1.1 million-acre-foot dam project would flood 30 miles of
Cheesman Canyon southwest of Denver to create a reservoir for city
water. Its cost has been estimated at between $500 million and $1
billion.
   Kerrey, speaking by telephone from Washington, said DeHihns'
decision indicates that EPA officials are willing to discuss
alternative proposals to the dam and believe Colorado could do more
in the way of conservation.
   ``It is possible that other alternatives could be detrimental to
Nebraska, although the alternatives that were mentioned by DeHihns
would not be,'' Kerrey said.
   He said he hoped the agency can select an alternative that isn't
``environmentally offensive,'' while still allowing for Denver's
water needs.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dog attacks on mail carriers are increasing, the
Post Office says, blaming the increase on warmer weather than usual
and on people keeping larger dogs.
   Hot weather makes dogs irritable and attacks on mailmen were up
by 40 percent in the first six months of this year, the Post Office
said.
   A survey of the problem in the current long hot summer by The
Times of London reported a mail carrier in Somerset was bitten on
the arm when a dog leaped through the window of his delivery van.
   In Bristol, a mail carrier had a narrow escape when a guard dog
inside a house crashed through the glass front door to try to get
him.
   There were 7,057 dog attacks on mail carriers in Britain last
year, nearly one-fifth more than in 1987. Dog attacks cost the Post
Office $515,000 a year.
   To stop them, the Post Office is testing a device that emits a
high-pitched sound inaudible to humans but intimidating to dogs.
   In the past, mail carriers facing a threatening dog were advised
to get down on all fours and look the beast straight in the eye. Few
were brave enough to try, the Post Office said.

   ``He didn't do it,'' defense attorney John Henry said of Mayor
Tommy Voyles, 43, who has remained in office and on the job in
Parkin, a town of 2,000 about 25 miles west of Memphis, Tenn.
   Voyles was arrested a week ago on an eight-count federal grand
jury indictment. The charges include one count of conspiring to
distribute cocaine and seven counts of distributing cocaine from
1987 through 1989. Voyles is serving his first term in the
$600-a-month mayor's post.
   U.S. District Judge Elsijane T. Roy set a trial date of Oct. 10.
Voyles remains free on $50,000 bond.
   The indictment alleges that Voyles conspired with William
Criswell, 50, a used-car dealer from Earle, to sell cocaine.
Criswell also faces a conspiracy charge.

   Live snakes sent to video rental shop owners to
promote a horror film will be retrieved and the stunt will be
canceled because of public outcry, the organizers said Tuesday.
   Cinema International Corp., which began sending out 700 Chinese
rat snakes to shops nationwide last week as part of a promotional
package, said it was worried about the reptiles.
   ``We were worried that all this unwarranted attention could get
the public overly interested in the snakes, and result in them
coming to harm,'' said Paul Brett, the company's marketing manager.
``We thought the best thing to do was to take them back.''
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had a
different view on what might cause the snakes harm. It said last
week that directions accompanying the snakes had incorrectly said
they didn't need to be fed during what Cinema International planned
as the snakes' month-long stay in the shops.
   But an RSPCA spokeswoman said Tuesday it welcomed the end of the
promotion, saying ``obviously CIC has seen the error of their ways,
and we're very pleased about that.''
   The spokeswoman said it would prosecute the company if any of the
snakes suffered.
   The snakes, which were not poisonous, were sent out to promote
the release of the video of the film ``The Serpent and the Rainbow.''

<HEAD>EPA Says Arizona Plant Pollutes Grand Canyon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency concluded
today that emissions from a massive coal-fired power plant in
Arizona cause up to 70 percent of the air pollution over the Grand
Canyon and must be curbed.
   In announcing its preliminary findings, the EPA said it expects a
final decision by next February on how pollution from the Navajo
Generating Station is to be curbed.
   Operators of the Page, Ariz., plant about 12 miles from the
northern rim of the canyon have argued that no additional pollution
curbs should be required because much of the canyon pollution comes
from other sources in the Los Angeles area and Mexico.
   But the EPA said the Park Service tests, using a chemical tracer
that was released through the power plant's 750-foot smokestacks,
demonstrated that on average about 40 percent of the pollution over
the Grand Canyon originates with the plant and during some periods
the percentage is as high as 70 percent.
   Officials said a solution may require the plant to install
expensive ``scrubber'' technology to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions, which currently range as high as 12 to 13 tons an hour
during peak power periods.
   The 2,250-megawatt power plant, partially owned by the federal
government, has been under close scrutiny by the U.S. Park Service
to determine to what extent it contributes to the bright, white
layers of haze clearly visible over the canyon during much of the
year, especially in winter.
   ``We have substantial evidence that the Navajo Generating Station
is a significant contributor to the visiblity problem,'' said F.
Henry Habicht, the EPA's deputy administrator. ``Action must be
taken now to protect the Grand Canyon.''
   The plant is one of the largest coal-burning electric generating
facilities in the country, burning 24,000 tons of coal a day.
Because of the plant's size, sulfur dioxide emissions are a problem
even though it burns largely low-sulfur coal.
   The federal government could be required to pay for some of the
pollution control equipment because the Interior Department's Bureau
of Reclamation holds a 24 percent interest in the facility. The
government uses electricity from the plant to pump water from the
Colorado River for irrigation in central Arizona.
   The EPA action was prompted by a lawsuit filed by the
Environmental Defense Fund, a private group.

   All his old hits will be on the album, but with a twist.
   ``It won't be your standard type of recording,'' Fries said.
``It's more like poetry and there will be a lot of natural sounds in
the background.''
   He will team up with the group Manheim Steamroller, one of the
best-selling groups in the jazzy, spacey, mostly instrumental music
that has become to be known as New Age.
   ``This album will give me one more shot of adrenaline,'' he said.
``Then I'm going to sit back and have some fun.''

   New York Mets pitcher Frank Viola's victory in
Los Angeles not only ended a losing streak but also put the bite on
a New York deli.
   Earlier this month, Abe Lebewohl, proprietor of the Second Avenue
Deli, said he'd give a one-pound salami to anyone who came into his
restaurant with a ticket stub from a Mets game won by Viola.
   Viola proceeded to lose his next three games.
   But Monday night he shut out the Dodgers, and the very next
morning New Yorker Stuart Baron walked into Lebewohl's restaurant
and handed over a stub for the game at Dodger Stadium, 3,000 miles
away.
   Baron didn't attend the game but had ordered a ticket by phone
Saturday.
   ``I wanted to see the look on their faces when I walked in at 9
o'clock with the stub from a road game on the West Coast that had
ended at 1 a.m.,'' said Baron. ``I did it for the effect, a joke.''
   The salami, 10 inches long and three inches thick, sells for $7.
Baron's stub was for a $4 upper-deck seat at Dodger Stadium, but
ticket agency commission and delivery by air express ran the total
to $14.

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan In Flap Over Anti-Drug Grant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan is being
criticized for her plans to stay away from a junior high school in a
gang-plagued neighborhood and deliver an anti-drug grant at a
different school.
   Board of Education member Rita Walters charged Monday that Mrs.
Reagan is too afraid to enter the south-central Los Angeles
neighborhood that is intended to benefit from the grant.
   Ms. Walters made the accusations after learning that Mrs. Reagan,
the wife of former President Reagan, would not go to John Muir High
School on Sept. 14 to present the school with a $36,392 grant.
   Instead, Mrs. Reagan plans to make the presentation at Gates
Street School in the Lincoln Heights area north of downtown.
   ``The issue is the insult that is rendered when you're going to
give money for a program in one community but you're afraid to go
into the community,'' Ms. Walters said.
   However, Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent
Leonard Britton said the Secret Service, not Mrs. Reagan, made the
arrangements for the presentation.
   City police and the Secret Service suggested the alternate
location because similar events had been held there, said Deputy
Superintendent Sid Thompson.
   Neither the Secret Service or representatives for Mrs. Reagan
could be reached for comment early today.
   Ms. Walters said that she would not attend the presentation if it
was held at Gates.
   ``This is an absolute slap in the face,'' she said.
   Britton said the district would discuss the issue with the Secret
Service before making a final decision about where the presentation
will be.

   A juvenile court Tuesday sentenced
two Czechoslovak teen-agers to two years' probation for hijacking a
Hungarian jetliner.
   No one was injured in the March hijacking of the Malev Airlines
jet, but Frankfurt juvenile court judge Klaus Dirszoweit said the
teen-agers had put passengers' lives in danger.
   Stefan Macicko, 17, and Dusan Styck, 16, said they seized the
plane because they wanted asylum in the West.
   Armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle, they grabbed a
hostage at Prague's Ruzyne airport on March 29 and forced their way
onto the Soviet-built Tupolev-154 plane, firing a single shot into
the air.
   After releasing 82 passengers, including all the women and
children, they forced the plane to fly to West Germany with 11
remaining passengers and a crew of four.
   They surrendered peacefully at Frankfurt airport, where the plane
had been scheduled to fly, three hours after the hijacking began.
They confessed to authorities, and there was no trial.
   The court said the teen-agers would be transferred to a youth
home in West Germany's Hesse state, where they will be allowed to
attend school while serving the probation.
   Shortly after the hijacking, Czechoslovak authorities requested
extradiction of the teen-agers, but West German officials decided to
prosecute them in Frankfurt instead.

   President Bush wrapped up a strategy
session today with top Cabinet officials on a new anti-drug policy
and promised the United States will do all it can to help Colombia
fight its violent drug cartels.
   ``We will cooperate with Colombia to the best of our ability,''
Bush told reporters outside his oceanfront vacation home, adding
that the administration supports ``what the president of that
country is trying to do.''
   Asked about Colombian President Virgilio Barco's televised appeal
to drug users abroad to stop using narcotics, Bush said, ``I fully
agree with that. So does our drug czar, Bill Bennett. ...We talked
about that at lunch.''
   The president said ``we did have a very good discussion on the
anti-narcotics program. We'll have more to say on that next week.''
   White House officials have said the anti-drug plan, to be
revealed Sept. 5 in a televised presidential address to the nation,
will cost around $8 billion _ $2 billion above current anti-drug
spending levels.
   It will attempt to cut off drugs at the source, stiffen penalties
for users and expand treatment for addicts, they said.
   Bush was asked if he planned to increase economic aid to foreign
countries as part of his anti-drug package in view of the violence
in Colombia. He declined to answer directly, saying ``We'll have
more to say on that at the appropriate time, which will be fairly
soon.''
   Joining Bush at his oceanfront vacation home were Bennett, the
White House drug policy director; Attorney General Dick Thornburgh;
CIA Director William Webster; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   At a news briefing later, Scowcroft said, ``The focus of the
meeting was on the international aspects'' of the anti-drug
strategy, with particular emphasis on the situation in Colombia.
   The administration had initially been considering $300 million in
economic and military aid to the Andean countries, including
Colombia. Scowcroft said that figure has already been raised by the
$65 million package of assistance for Colombia that the White House
announced last Friday.
   ``There will be, I think it's fair to say, a greater military
role in the future with respect to the drug program than has been
true in the past,'' Cheney said in a television interview before the
meeting.
   Asked on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' what kind of military
role he envisioned in the expanded fight, Cheney said, ``We'll let
the president worry about that next week.''
   Meanwhile, Colombia's Justice Minister Monica de Greiff said she
was requesting $19 million in U.S. aid to purchase armored cars,
bulletproof vests, metal detectors for court houses and other
security devices to protect her country's judges, under seige by the
Medellin drug cartel.
   ``The law is under siege in Colombia and we must protect it every
way we can,'' she told a news conference in Washington.
   Asked about the aid request, Bush did not discuss it
specifically, but said, ``It's being worked out now, the details.''
   The aid package being sought is in addition to the $5 million
that the Bush administration has approved over a two-year period to
improve security for judges and the $65 million in military aid
announced last week.
   David Runkel, a spokesman for Thornburgh, said the Justice
Department was in the process of drafting extradition requests for
12 Colombian drug traffickers under federal indictment.
   Barco, in Bogota, put to rest rumors that Ms. de Greiff had
decided to resign in the face of death threats from drug cartel
leaders worried about possible extradition to the United States.
   The drug traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every
trafficker sent to the United States to face trial.
   On his daily golf outing Monday, Bush declined to comment on a
Newsweek report that he had approved a covert action in Colombia
against the drug lords.
   ``If I discussed covert action, it wouldn't be covert and I don't
discuss that kind of thing at all anyway,'' he said.
   Bush on Monday got a firsthand report from Secretary of Labor
Elizabeth Dole and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole on their visits
in Warsaw with the new leadership of Poland.
   Bush said it could take ``a lot more money'' than his $119
million aid package to help Poland rebuild its economy.
   ``But it's also got to take political reform,'' the president
said. ``It's got to take economic reform so that when they talk
about investment and privatization, something really happens.''
   Bush praised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for being
``extraordinarily understanding'' of the changes taking place in
Eastern Europe. He said he hopes peaceful change would continue
``not only outside the Soviet Union, but in it.''
   Bush, who met with Lech Walesa in Gdansk last month, said that if
the Solidarity leader visits the United States later this year, ``I
certainly will'' meet with him.

   Colombia's Justice Minister Monica de Greiff
today vowed to continue to fight her country's drug lords despite
death threats, and she appealed for more U.S. aid to protect judges.
   ``The law is under siege in Colombia and we must protect it every
way we can,'' she told a news conference at the Colombian embassy.
She disputed reports that she had considered resigning in the face
of death threats against her, her husband and the couple's
3-year-old son.
   ``I never considered resigning,'' she said. ``The threats are out
there, but I am satisfied with my protection right now.''
   Ms. de Greiff said she would remain in Washington through Sept. 6
to continue discussions with Bush administration officials about her
requests for additional aid to protect Colombian judges from
assassination.
   The 32-year-old justice minister said she was requesting $19
million to purchase armored cars, bulletproof vests, metal detectors
for court houses and other security devices to protect the jurists.
   The aid package being sought is in addition to the $5 million
that the Bush administration has approved over a two-year period to
improve security for judges.
   The president also has approved $65 million in U.S. military aid
to help the Colombian government fight the drug cartels.
   At his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he met with
top aides on the anti-drug battle plan he will unveil Sept. 5, Bush
was noncommittal when asked about the requested $19 million in aid
to protect judges.
   He first declined comment, then said, ``It's being worked out
now, the details.'' And he said the United States ``will cooperate
with Colombia to the best of our ability.''
   Ms. de Greiff said she was anxious to continue her efforts to
preserve the Colombian legal system. She said her government faced a
fight with a foe that has ``no respect for the law or even the
minimal standards of decency.''
   But she expressed confidence that Colombia ``will survive this
crisis.''
   She said she was ``very pleased'' with the response of the Bush
administration, saying she still was hoping for more assistance.
   Meanwhile, David Runkel, a spokesman for Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, backed away from the Justice Department's earlier
prediction that a Colombian drug trafficker wanted in this country
would be extradited this week.
   Runkel said Eduardo Martinez Romero may not be extradited for two
weeks under procedures set forth by the Colombian government. He
also raised the possibility that the Colombian Supreme Court, which
overturned the extradition procedures in 1987, may review the
emergency decrees for extradition that recently were promulgated by
Colombian President Virgilio Barco.
   ``Those extradition procedures are complicated, and I think there
is a possibility there may be a decision to have the Supreme Court
in Colombia rule on those new procedures,'' the spokesman said.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``we have every hope and expectation of
getting custody of Mr. Martinez.''
   Runkel said the Justice Department was in the process of drafting
extradition requests for 12 other Colombian drug traffickers under
federal indictment.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Fears Force Educators to Change School Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educators are canceling or curtailing school
activities such as shop classes, cheerleading and gymnastics to
avoid lawsuits and high insurance premiums, a group backing revised
liability laws said Tuesday.
   The American Tort Reform Association released results of two
surveys that association President Martin F. Connor said
``illustrate just how much America's litigiousness and risk-aversion
has diminished the quality of life for all our students.''
   But the head of a trial lawyers group challenged the surveys as
being insurance industry-supported scare tactics.
   ``I think this is a red herring,'' said James Taglieri, president
of the Trial Lawyers Association. He said the tort reform group has
the backing of the insurance industry that wants to avoid paying out
claims while ``reaping incredible profits'' from exorbitant premiums.
   Taglieri said the ploy of the insurance industry is to ``pressure
the public into thinking there is a crisis in tort law.''
   According to the surveys of attorneys and school principals, the
threat of lawsuits is prompting educators to cancel class trips,
shop classes and athletic activities, particularly gymnatistics,
football and cheerleading. Other affected school programs include
laboratory science programs, such as chemistry, and use of school
playgrounds.
   Those who don't are paying the price _ in the form of higher
insurance payments, said Connor and Ivan Gluckman, staff counsel for
the National Association of Secondary School Principals.
   Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer
Organization, agreed.
   ``ATRA has an axe to grind,'' Hunter said. The reform group's
purpose was to slant the questions in the surveys to ``get these
results'' that were based more on ``gut feelings and attitudes
rather than'' facts, Hunter said.
   ``Reduced activity is not necessarily bad, depending on the risks
and exposure,'' Hunter added. ``If things are too risky (and
canceled), then it's actually a benefit, not a degradation of the
educational system.''
   The 190 principals who responded to the survey, all members of
the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said that
while only 16 class-related programs were canceled, about half of
more than 240 activities were modified because lawsuits were either
threatened or filed, said Gluckman.
   Fifty-eight percent of the responding principals said there was a
noticeable difference in the kinds of school programs being offered
because of the threat of lawsuits and high insurance costs, Gluckman
said.
   The survey, conducted last December, showed 51 extracurricular
programs were canceled and 301 modified.
   Restrictions on athletics have included limits on heights of
pyramids by cheerleaders, stopping the use of trampolines by
gymnasts and halting diving competitions for swimmers, the
association said.
   Sixty-two percent of the attorneys representing school boards
that are members of the National School Boards Association reported
no changes in school activities. However, most indicated that
schools are paying higher insurance premiums to continue offering
the programs.
   One in five attorneys said they had been involved in lawsuits or
out-of-court settlements that affected school-related programs.
About 290 members of the NSBA's Council of School Attorneys
completed the survey.
   The American Tort Reform Association is a Washington-based
organization that advocates revising the system of liability
lawsuits.

   A sheriff today said he doubted a wounded,
handcuffed Canadian fugitive who was strapped to a stretcher could
have caused the wreck of a medical helicopter that killed all four
aboard.
   The bodies of Canadian fugitive Robert L. Adams, 25, and three
crew members were found by searchers Monday in northern Idaho on
Larch Mountain, 25 miles northeast of Spokane.
   Chip Roos, the sheriff of Bonner County, Idaho, said today that
Adams' body was still strapped to a gurney at the legs and both
elbows, and one arm was cuffed to the stretcher. That meant he had
only partial mobility in the lower portion of the other arm, where a
nurse had rigged an intravenous tube, Roos said.
   ``I really start to doubt any suspect activity that could have
been instrumental'' in the crash, Roos said.
   Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
FBI were dispatched to the site, authorities said today. Dennis
Hanson of Eagle Helicopter, which provides pilots, mechanics and the
medical helicopter to Sacred Heart Medical Center, said he and
National Transportation Safety Board officials were also heading to
the scene.
   Roos said other factors, such as mechanical failure or bad
weather, more likely contributed to the crash. A storm had passed
over northern Idaho on Sunday night, when the chopper went down.
   Bob Zinkgraf, who was listening to a scanner at his home in
Colbert, Wash., said the crew _ the pilot, a registered nurse and a
respiratory therapist _ reported that Adams was scuffling before the
Aerospatiale Astar from Sacred Heart hospital in Spokane crashed
around 10 p.m. Sunday,
   He said the crew ``reported they were having problems with the
suspect.''
   ``A couple of minutes later, they reported they were in a scuffle
with the suspect. Then we heard the hospital trying to get in touch
with them. They reported they lost contact with the helicopter,''
Zinkgraf said.
   However, a medical center spokesman, Marilyn Thordarson, said the
last report at 9:56 p.m. made no mention of any difficulty, and that
only static and background noises were heard afterward. The FAA was
not monitoring the radio transmissions.
   Sheriff's Detective John Valdez said the pilot was frantic in his
last radio transmission. ``He said something like, `We have a
problem. We are going down,''' Valdez said.
   Roos said it appeared the craft broke apart in mid-air at high
altitude, since there was little damage to trees and wreckage was
strewn over a wide area.
   ``It really could have been anything. All we know is that
whatever happened must have caught the pilot by surprise. He went
straight down from a high altitude,'' he said.
   ``It just doesn't seem likely to us, and hearing some comments
from the feds yesterday, that the likelihood of patient involvement
was that high.''
   Earlier Sunday night, Adams apparently overpowered a U.S. Customs
agent to enter the United States illegally near a Customs station in
Eastport, Idaho, the Boundary County Sheriff's Department said.
   He broke into a nearby home, and, in an exchange of gunfire, was
shot in the chest by a Boundary County, Idaho, man, police said.
   The homeowner, 71-year-old Bob McGlocklin, and Adams were taken
to the medical center in separate flights. McGlocklin was in
satisfactory condition with wounds to his right arm and back, the
medical center said.
   Adams, of Bridgefield, Nova Scotia, was wanted in Canada for
investigation of escape, sexual assault and auto theft charges.
   Boundary County Sheriff's Sgt. Rick Alonzo said he had
volunteered to travel in the helicopter with Adams, but the flight
crew said the additional passenger would be too much weight, the
newspaper said.
   The FAA is conducting the preliminary investigation.
   ``If it turns out there was activity aboard the aircraft that
contributed to or caused the accident _ and there is speculation
about the prisoner having a tussle with flight crew _ it would be
referred to the FBI as a criminal matter,'' said Mitch Barker of the
regional FAA office in Seattle.
   The crew included pilot Pat Varea, age unknown; Lyn Gould, 31, a
registered nurse; and Bob Siekerman, 36, a respiratory therapist.
All three were from Spokane, Ms. Thordarson said.

<HEAD>`Ice Curtain' Thawing Fast Between Alaska and the Soviet Far East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN FOSDICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With more than a score of trade,
cultural and scientific agreements in the works, the political ``Ice
Curtain'' is melting fast between the Soviet Union and Alaska.
   Still, Gov. Steve Cowper, who leaves Wednesday on a 10-day,
6,700-mile ``trade and friendship mission'' to the Soviet Far East,
counsels patience.
   ``I think they perceive a clear advantage in perestroika and
glasnost _ the liberalizing of their political and economic
system,'' the governor said. ``But many of these changes will be
taken over a longer time frame, because change is inherently
unstable.''
   The political thaw has led to so many agreements between Alaska
and the Soviet Union that even Cowper has trouble keeping up with
them. He recently asked that any initiatives across the Bering
Strait be coordinated through his office.
   ``The main purpose was that a lot of people were coming out of
the woodwork purporting to be representatives of Alaska or the
Soviet Union,'' said David Ramseur, Cowper's press secretary.
``Things are happening so fast that we wanted to get a handle on
it.''
   Alaska ``can't sign treaties or agreements that bind nations,''
Cowper said. ``What we can do is enter into preliminary
negotiations, sort out the details at our level, then hand them to
the representatives of the respective federal governments for a
ready-made treaty.
   At a 1987 summit in Iceland, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
President Reagan issued a statement encouraging cooperation on
issues relating to the Arctic. Many Alaska-Soviet ties have been
forged since then, including:
   _ A ``Friendship Flight'' from Nome to Provideniya in 1988
reunited Eskimos separated since the political ``Ice Curtain'' was
drawn in 1948. A small commuter airline began charter service
between the two cities a year later.
   _ A Soviet icebreaker helped rescue whales trapped in ice off
Barrow in 1988, and a Soviet skimmer ship helped mop up after the
nation's worst oil spill hit Prince William Sound in March.
   _ An expedition used skis and sled dogs to make a 1,200-mile from
Anadyr to Nome earlier this year to promote Alaska-Soviet relations.
   A pact opening the Alaska-Soviet border to visa-free travel by
Eskimos with relatives in both countries is to be signed in
September.
   Negotiations are under way that could lead to an agreement to
protect fishing grounds from overfishing. Both nations also are
working to establish joint sea rescue missions in the Bering Strait.
   ``Because of our geographical location and our history in Alaska,
we were in a much better position than other states to press for
agreements relating to the Soviet Far East,'' Cowper said. ``As a
result, we're recognized now as being in the forefront of efforts
leading to friendship between the two nations.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 2.7 percent
annual rate in the spring, far higher than previously estimated, the
government said Tuesday in a report viewed as further evidence that
the country's longest peacetime expansion is in no danger of
faltering.
   The Commerce Department said that the increase in the gross
national product from April through June was a full percentage point
higher than the anemic 1.7 percent GNP increase originally estimated
a month ago.
   Most of the new-found strength came in consumer spending, a
critical sector because it accounts for two-thirds of total economic
activity. Government spending, business investment and U.S. export
sales also provided momentum during the spring.
   The GNP report showed that while inflation picked up in the
second quarter, the increase was not quite as bad as previously
believed. A price guage tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of
5.1 percent from April through June because of higher energy costs.
A month ago, this increase had been put at 5.2 percent.
   In further good news for the economy, the Commerce Department
said Tuesday that sales of new homes, bolstered by falling mortgage
rates, shot up 14.4 percent in July, their biggest monthly gain in
almost three years.
   With the strength in home sales, which had been one of the
weakest sectors of the economy, analysts said they expected
respectable growth in the final half of the year in line with the
forecast being made by the Bush administration.
   This is a far different view than the one prevalent just a month
ago when the initial GNP report put growth at such a sluggish rate
that many analysts expressed fears that the country was on the verge
of its first recession since the 1981-82 downturn.
   Since that time, however, various reports have shown that
business activity in the spring was not as sluggish as previously
believed.
   ``We have had almost a total rewriting of history,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Instead of the entrenched
slowdown suggested by the original data, we now have a story of a
very solid economy that was picking up momentum in the second
quarter.''
   In the first three months of the year, the GNP grew at a 3.7
percent rate, but most of that increase included a one-time boost
that resulted from returning anticipated farm output this year to
its pre-drought levels. Without that increase, non-farm GNP rose at
a weak 1.5 percent rate in the first three months of the year.
   Analysts have been busy revising upward their growth forecasts
with some approaching the administration's own projection that the
economy will turn in a respectable 2.9 percent increase in 1989,
compared to a four-year high of 4.4 percent in 1984.
   ``This economy is not headed into a recession,'' said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``In
fact, we are doing better for the seventh year of an economic
expansion than we had any reason to hope for.''
   To reach the administration's growth target, the economy will
have to expand at an annual rate of just 2.2 percent in the second
half of the year.
   Sinai said GNP growth could rise to around 3 percent in the
current July-September quarter, but other analysts said they were
looking for slightly slower growth because of a need to work down
inventories of unsold goods in such sectors as autos.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman two weeks ago
criticized the Federal Reserve, suggesting that if a downturn does
occur it will be the fault of the central bank for keeping interest
rates too high.
   But analysts said there was little likelihood now that the
central bank will lower rates any time soon, given the robust
economic growth and the fact that inflationary pressures have abated
somewhat but not disappeared.
   In another report, the government said that corporations' profits
after taxes fell a sharp 5.4 percent in the second quarter, the
biggest setback in three years and a reflection of rising business
costs, analysts said.
   The GNP report showed that consumer spending advanced in the
second quarter at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, double the original
estimate. Government purchases jumped by 12.3 percent while business
investment spending climbed by 8.2 percent.
   The trade deficit as measured by the GNP declined by $2.5
billion, slightly better than the original estimate.
   The weakest sector in the GNP report was housing, which suffered
a 12.6 percent drop in construction in the spring, the worst setback
since 1982. But analysts noted the big jump in new homes sales in
July and said this should spur construction increases in the months
ahead.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at $4.134 trillion in the second quarter.

<HEAD>Lugar: Arias Wants U.S. Aid for Contras Until Resettlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Richard Lugar says President Oscar Arias
of Costa Rica, optimistic that Nicaragua's Marxist government can be
removed through free elections, favors continued U.S. humanitarian
aid to the Contra rebels until they can be resettled peacefully.
   Lugar also said he believes the profits of drug production and
distribution in nations such as Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are so
enormous that the supply of narcotics probably cannot be shut off
until demand for cocaine and other drugs in the United State is
dramatically reduced.
   The Indiana Republican, a ranking minority member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, commented at a news conference as he
reviewed his impressions of a 14-day, nine-nation trip through Latin
America.
   Reporting on his visit to Costa Rica, Lugar said: ``President
Arias told me he favors continuation of American humanitarian aid to
the Contras through the Nicaraguan elections (next February) and
perhaps after that.''
   Lugar said that when family members are taken into consideration,
some 60,000 to 70,000 people are either Contra members or closely
associated with them.
   Arias believes that re-integrating so large a group into
Nicaraguan society or settling them elsewhere will be difficult and
time consuming and that they will have to be supported until their
future is secured, Lugar said.
   Arias ``believes the majority of them will be integrated, but it
will be difficult,'' Lugar said.
   Lugar noted that the agreement reached earlier this year by the
presidents of five Central American nations calling for the
disbanding of the Contras by December is purely voluntary on the
part of the rebels.
   Arias, the principal architect of the accord, also stressed the
need for the United States and nations in Latin America and Western
Europe to go into Nicaragua to boost voter confidence that the
February elections will be held and that a non-Sandinista president
can be elected president, Lugar said.
   ``He said polls taken by Costa Ricans in Nicaragua show that a
unified opposition would defeat'' the Sandinistas, ``and he is
optimistic that could happen,'' Lugar said.
   ``The Nicaraguans have to get over a psychic block that leads
them to believe that either nothing will happen or that elections
will not make a difference,'' Lugar added.
   He said Arias hopes to give the process a boost at an
international conference in San Jose in October marking the 100th
anniversary of democracy in Costa Rica, noting that President Bush
plans to attend.
   The five Central American presidents will meet in Managua, the
Nicaraguan capital, in December. Arias hopes that also will help
promote the elections process, Lugar said.
   Lugar said he found the narcotics situation in countries such as
Colombia and Peru difficult, complicated and ``truly depressing.''
   He said U.S. officials estimate that 450 square miles of Peruvian
farm land is in coca production with Peruvian officials estimating
the total as twice that.
   Coca paste is the basic ingrediant of cocaine and Lugar said it
is hard to imagine what crops could be substituted that would bring
in a quarter of the narcotics profits now being pumped into the
inflation-ravaged Peruvian economy.
   In Colombia, Lugar said it is essential the United States
strengthen a government that is under siege by narcotics cartels in
the aftermath of the assassination of a leading presidential
candidate.
   Eradicating the flow of narcotics into the United States depends
on drying up demand among Americans using drugs, Lugar said.
   ``We should be discouraging first users and casual users and
rehabilitating addicts,'' he said.

   Distribution of $65 million in U.S. military
aid for Colombia's war on drug traffickers awaits a detailed list of
needs from that government, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   ``When the list is returned to the United States delivery will
begin,'' Pete Williams said at a routine Pentagon news briefing.
   President Bush last Friday granted the aid package of aircraft,
boats, arms and ammunition to work with Colombia to ``bring to
justice those responsible for the scourge of drug trafficking.''
   An unprecedented crackdown is underway in Colombia following the
recent murder of a presidential candidate. Drug traffickers declared
``total and absolute war'' on the government, and on Tuesday set off
seven bombs, according to police.
   Police also blamed traffickers Sunday for nine bombings of banks
in Medellin. There were no claims of responsibility.
   Williams said the United States sent Colombia a list of equipment
available for immediate transfer from Defense Department stocks
after Bush granted the aid. The Colombians, in turn, issued their
list of requests.
   ``Officials of both governments are now analyzing those needs,''
the spokeksman said, adding, ``The DOD is ready to provide immediate
airlift.''
   Williams declined to say what type of equipment would be
provided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons,
ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medical
supplies.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in announcing the aid
package last Friday, said the United States would Huey helicopters
for transporting troops, equipment and ammunitions, Blackhawk
helicopters for medical evacuations, planes, trucks and assault
boats.
   The package also is to include American military advisers, which
Fitzwater said would be `relatively small.'' He said the soldiers
would not assume combat roles.
   Williams said the American personnel would be used to train the
Colombians in how to operate the equipment. He said the goods would
not be delivered until the entire list was received and approved,
which he added could be this week.

   A tuna boat lost practically its entire haul in
freeing an endangered humpback whale tangled in the vessel's nets
for more than two hours, the Coast Guard said Tuesday.
   The young whale, caught Monday by the 150-foot Eileen Marie,
appeared unharmed when it was freed, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer
Jack Mason said.
   Environmentalists complain that marine mammals often become
tangled in tuna nets and drown.
   The incident occurred about 15 miles off Provincetown on
Stellwagen Bank, where humpbacks return to feed every summer.
Whale-watching boats often cruise the area. The 20-foot whale was
about half the size of mature humpbacks.
   The crew of the Eileen Marie freed the whale by manipulating the
nets until it spilled out but lost about 95 percent of the boat's
catch, Mason said.
   ``They were making all possible attempts to free the whale to the
extent of losing tuna,'' Mason said.
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Ellen Marie Harrington said she didn't
know how much tuna was caught and lost but that the vessel could
carry millions of pounds of tuna. The Eileen Marie did not answer
marine radio calls Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Atlantis was rolled to
the launch pad Tuesday for a mission that will send the
plutonium-fueled Galileo spacecraft on a six-year flight to Venus
and Jupiter.
   The rollout allows plenty of time to ready Atlantis for liftoff
Oct. 12, said Conrad Nagel, who directs shuttle preparation. Oct. 12
is the start of a 43-day period in which Jupiter will be in position
to receive a probe from Earth in 1995.
   Nagel said the Galileo probe would be put in the payload bay on
Wednesday.
   Five astronauts will deploy Galileo about six hours after launch,
starting it on a journey during which it is to fly by Venus, pass
Earth twice and make the first close approach to an asteroid.
   The circuitous 2.4-million-mile route was chosen so Galileo can
use the gravitational pull of Venus and Earth to accelerate it
slingshot-fashion toward Jupiter.
   Galileo is to parachute a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere and
then spend about two years orbiting the planet, photographing it and
studying it with scientific instruments.
   To power it through its long journey, Galileo will carry two
122-pound nuclear generators.
   Anti-nuclear groups have protested that the nuclear material
could pose a hazard if it were released during an accident, although
no protesters were at the rollout.
   ``If people really understood what we're doing here, the
significance of it, the risks we are taking, and the precautions we
are putting into place, there really should be no concern,'' Nagel
said.
   NASA has said that the generators were tested to survive the most
explosive type of shuttle failure and that a plutonium release would
be unlikely to hurt anyone in any case.
   The Galileo mission will mark a continuation of the nation's
renewal of planetary exploration following an 12-year hiatus. The
drought ended in May when another Atlantis crew released the
Magellan spacecraft, which is to orbit Venus in 1990.
   Voyager 2, launched in 1977, streaked by Neptune last week to
complete a grand tour of four outer planets. During its odyssey,
Voyager 2 also examined Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was first in the Nielsen TV
ratings, but another working class housewife, Peg Bundy in ``Married
... With Children,'' gave Fox Broadcasting a big boost for the week
ended Aug. 27.
   ``Roseanne'' finished ahead of NBC's ``Cheers'' in their summer
seesaw battle for first.
   Fox's ``Married ... With Children'' jumped up in the ratings
again, this time for a tie for 17th place with NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
The show got a 13.4 rating, its highest ever, and was first in its
time period Sunday for the second time this summer.
   The Fox comedy was the only original show, other than ABC's
``20-20,'' in the 30 top shows for the week.
   Fox's fledging fourth network has made its first ratings
breakthrough in recent months with its shows rising out of the
ratings cellar for the first time. Shows such as ``Married ... With
Children,'' ``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Totally Hidden Video''
have all done well. ``Open House,'' a revamping of ``Duet,''
premiered this past week in 47th place, coming in ahead of the
second half of the ABC Sunday movie.
   Comedy continued its domination of the ratings. Eighteen of the
20 highest-rated shows were comedies. The movie pilot for NBC's
``Baywatch'' was tied for seventh with ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' and
the CBS movie ``Tricks of the Trade'' was 12th.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey for the 62nd
consecutive week with an average of 11.4. ABC was second with 9.7
and CBS was third with 9.6.
   For the season to date from Sept. 19, 1988, NBC was first with
14.5, ABC second with 11.7 and CBS third with 11.6. The rating is
the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes with television
in the United States. The share is the percentage of sets in use.
   Here are the Top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's
``A Different World,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Dear John''
tied, ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' NBC's ``Baywatch: Panic at
Malibu'' and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' tied, ABC's ``Mr.
Belvedere,'' NBC's ``Night Court.''
   CBS had only three shows in the first 20, the movie ``Tricks of
the Trade'' in 12th place, ``Designing Women'' 13th and ``Murphy
Brown'' 14th.
   The NBC summer comedy ``FM,'' which premiered in fifth place last
week, fell to 37th for a tie with CBS' ``Newhart.''
   ``The CBS Evening News'' was first among the news shows with a
rating of 9.7. ABC was second with 8.5 and NBC was third with 8.0.
   The lowest-rated show for the week was ABC's ``Incredible
Sunday.'' The five bottom network shows were: CBS' ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' CBS' ``Outpost,'' CBS' ``Tour of Duty,'' ABC's ``Student
Exchange'' and ABC's ``Incredible Sunday.''

<HEAD>Woman Asks Court to Declare Her Black</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who says her parents listed her as white on
her birth certificate to help her later in life has asked a court to
declare her black.
   ``This is like emancipation for me,'' said Mary Christine Walker,
39. ``I don't want to be put in a box I don't fit in.''
   Walker, who has fair complexion, green eyes and light brown hair,
said three of her grandparents were black but one was white.
   The former public school teacher said she always has called
herself black and wants the official designation because she has
been accused of lying about her race to take advantage of
affirmative-action policies.
   Walker's lawyer, Penfield Tate II, said he had trouble filing the
petition last week to change her birth certificate.
   ``Nobody wanted it,'' Tate said. ``In the 20 years I've been
practicing law, I've never seen anything like it, and from some of
the reactions I got, I don't think anybody else had.''
   Walker said her parents ``wanted their kids to make it, and they
picked the easiest way possible. They knew what it was to be black.
They knew the problems.''
   ``Mom really stressed the white world on the kids _ education,
manners _ and she was very paranoid about the secret getting out,''
Walker said.
   Walker, whose family moved from Great Bend, Kan., to Colorado in
the 1950s, said she found her mixed heritage made her a target of
discrimination by people of both races.
   She said her father told her ``the whites didn't want you and
neither do the blacks. So I don't think he had a love of either
group.''
   Walker said she does not fault her parents' decision.
   ``I resent that this society is set up in such a way that someone
would have to pass,'' she said. ``It's a disgrace that this country
is so screwed up racially, because it really is.''

<HEAD>Moldavian Lawmakers Win First Battle on Language Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moldavian lawmakers trying to make
their language the official tongue of the southern republic
overwhelmingly won their first test of strength Tuesday, stopping a
bid to halt legislative debate.
   The republic's legislature voted 300-43 to proceed with the bill,
despite objections by deputies from two cities where 80,000 mostly
Russian workers have been on strike since last week in protest,
saying it would be the first step of a policy of discrimination.
Three deputies abstained and 30 were absent.
   The strikes have affected more than 100 factories and enterprises
in at least three cities in the republic that borders Romania.
   A key opponent of the bill said the vote to proceed with
legislative debate portends likely approval in the next few days.
   ``I think the law will be adopted, the bill will pass,'' said
Vladimir A. Solonar, a historian and a leader of Yedinstvo, a
Russian-language group. He said his group will try to amend it.
   Solonar warned that ``life won't be quiet'' if the bill passes.
``I know the situation is very dangerous, and in the future this
tension will not disappear,'' he said.
   The bill would make Moldavian, which is nearly identical to
Romanian, the official language. Moldavia currently has no law
defining an official language, but Russian is commonly used in
government, factories and commerce.
   Opponents of the bill want to see both Moldavian and Russian
named official languages. Yedinstvo is seeking amendments allowing
business managers to choose the language of their official
documents, essentially gutting a key portion of the law.
   The bill also would make Moldavian the language of communication
between Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Bulgarians and other
nationalities in the republic. That goes further than the language
laws in other Soviet republics. Many non-Moldavians don't speak
Moldavian, but they share some knowledge of Russian as a result of
Soviet schooling.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda criticized that part of the
bill Tuesday. The bill's opponents say that will force even
predominantly non-Moldavian residents to use Moldavian.
   The labor newspaper Trud attacked Moldavian nationalists, saying
they ``stepped up bitterness, mutual hostility and suspicion'' among
ethnic groups.
   The law also would restore the Latin alphabet, replacing the
Cyrillic imposed by dictator Josef Stalin after he annexed Moldavia
from Romania in 1940. Stalin imposed the Cyrillic alphabet to back
up his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct
nationalities.
   Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic's 4.2
million people. Tensions between the Moldavians and non-Moldavians
have been running high since the People's Front, a primarily
Moldavian group, began organizing this year to push the language law
and other demands for more autonomy from Moscow.
   The People's Front won the first battle when the legislature
convened and defeated an effort by deputies representing the
strikers to delay the session for months, well after a Communist
Party Central Committee meeting on ethnic issues expected in early
September.
   Mihai Ghimpu, acting chairman of the People's Front, said about
50 deputies opposed the bill. Other People's Front sources said
there may be as many as 100 votes against it.
   The law requires a two-thirds vote of all deputies who are
registered for the session. If Tuesday's registration does not
change, the opponents will need 116 of 346 votes to defeat it.
   ``We have to seize the moment,'' said Ala Myndycanu, a member of
the People's Front governing council. ``We have to solve our
problems before Moscow does.''
   Leonida Lari, a Moldavian poet and lawmaker, said in an
interview: ``The people are patient but they've been pushed to the
edge, they've been held back too long.''
   Speeches at the session, which was televised live in Kishinev,
overwhelmingly favored the language law.
   During the session, police surrounded the legislative building,
which flew the flag of the Moldavian Soviet republic, a red banner
with a green horizontal stripe and a hammer and sickle.
   On a nearby square, hundreds of People's Front supporters
gathered beneath the blue, yellow and red of the traditional
Moldavian flag.
   After the debate ended, the crowd swelled to several thousand
people and swarmed around about 100 people who marched past a statue
of Lenin and shouted slogans against the strikers.
   In the Baltic republics, meanwhile, Communist Party officials
accepted a stinging rebuke against nationalist activists that was
issued Saturday by the Communist Party's Central Committee in Moscow.
   But four Lithuanian legislators sent a telegram to the Kremlin
saying the Central Committee statement showed a ``dictatorship''
still rules. They also said the statement was ``anti-constitutional
... directed against the self-determination for the peoples of the
republics,'' according to Arunas Zabriunas, a leader of the
Lithuanian grassroots movement Sajudis.
   Vaino Vyalyas, the party chief in the republic of Estonia, said
the party agreed with the Central Committee's assessment that the
Baltics were in danger of falling into ``an abyss'' if they heeded
separatist calls for secession, Tass reported.
   Tarmu Tammerk, editor of the Estonian newspaper Kodumaa, said by
telephone that Vyalyas also criticized ``destabilizing groups of
different kinds,'' including those calling for secession and
restoration of the ``bourgeois order.'' That was a reference to the
independent government that ruled Estonia between the two world wars.
   Vyalyas said the republic wanted more local control, but
``Estonia is part and parcel of the Soviet Union as a sovereign
republic.'' However, he also said he believed firmly in ``the
self-determination of nations on the basis of democratic legal
guarantees.''
   The government of Lithuania and the Communist Party of a second
Baltic republic, Latvia, came into line Monday.
   Tass reported that the Lithuanian party ruled out secession,
saying, ``It is possible to be a free and sovereign nation within a
union of equal republics.''
   Lithuanian activists said Monday that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev told officials of the Lithuanian Communist Party the
republic had gone too far in its drive for independence.
   On Aug. 23, more than 1 million Baltic people joined hands in a
human chain protesting the 1939 agreement between Stalin and Adolf
Hitler that assigned the Baltics to a Soviet sphere of influence.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Cabinet, Opening Way For Economic Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran's parliament approved all 22 members
of President Hashemi Rafsanjani's new government Tuesday, opening
the way for economic reform and gradual restoration of ties with the
West.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the 270-member
Majlis took the ``unprecedented'' step of endorsing the entire
Cabinet. In past ballots, deputies rejected several nominees.
Earlier reports suggested three Cabinet candidates would be turned
down.
   Iran's state TV showed deputies chanting ``Death to America!
Death to Israel! Death to Britain!'' after the results of the secret
ballot were read out by Speaker Mehdi Karrubi.
   However, the new Cabinet contains more technocrats, many of them
Western-educated, than revolutionary ideologues.
   The appointments reflect Rafsanjani's pledge to focus on raising
living standards and boost private enterprise after a decade of
strict state controls on the economy.
   Rafsanjani had come under fire from radicals for dumping their
leaders from his Cabinet. They included outgoing Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who has been closely linked with Shiite Moslem
militants holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The endorsements came after Karrubi, a member of the radical
faction opposed to Rafsanjani's pragmatists, gave the Cabinet list
his personal backing at the last minute.
   ``I see Mr. Rafsanjani's Cabinet as a successful one and one that
suports the deprived ... and whose members have worked for the (1979
Islamic) revolution,'' Karrubi said.
   Karrubi's support was seen as critical for Rafsanjani, who was
elected president July 28 and handed broadened executive powers.
   The Cabinet approval indicated the radicals were prepared to
follow spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's call for an end to
political bickering.
   Khamenei became the Iran's supreme leader after the death June 3
of revolutionary partriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   But Karrubi, who succeeded Rafsanjani as speaker, also said the
new ministers would face tough scrutiny in the chamber, where
radical factions have dominated since parliamentary elections last
year.
   ``Our hands will not be tied if a minister gets the vote,'' he
said.
   Rafsanjani, speaking before the vote, called for more government
efficiency, noting that in the past ``only 50 or 60 percent of
programs'' passed in parliament had actually been implemented.
   He said ministers' programs must include an annual budget that
would need parliamentary approval.
   He defended his Cabinet's political credentials but stressed the
emphasis was placed on finding good managers ``because we are in the
reconstruction phase and ... right now we have to put more effort
into ensuring the programs are implemented.''
   Iran is seeking to rebuild industry after an eight-year war with
Iraq. It also hopes to boost productivity afer years of economic
mismanagement by revolutionary radicals.
   Rafsanajni also is expected to gradually revive links with the
West to end Iran's isolation and attract foreign investment.
   A key figure in restoring foreign relations will be Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, 44, a U.S.-trained pediatrician who
helped negotiate the cease-fire with Iraq that took effect in August
1988.
   Velayati was one of 14 ministers who received more than 200 votes
in parliament. Others were Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, 41, and
and Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, 39, a former leader of the
Revolutionary Guards.

   New Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu travels to the

   Kaifu, who took office Aug. 9, will not bring major trade or
diplomatic initiatives to his discussions with President Bush, a

   He does plan, however, to use Bush, baseball and talks with
academicians to seek closer ties with Americans to ease tension over
Japan's growing economic might, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Mr. Kaifu wanted at the earliest possible occasion to make a
personal approach to President Bush, not only for bilateral
relations, but in a global context as well,'' the official said.
   ``It is extremely important to have a personal relationship so
that both sides can pick up the phone when important problems crop
up,'' he said.
   The 58-year-old prime minister also will appeal to the American
public in several major speeches and visit Boston for a Red Sox game.
   In San Francisco, Washington and Boston, Kaifu will address
scholars and journalists as part of his effort to appeal directly to
people who influence American public opinion and policy.
   Recent surveys have indicated growing resentment in the United
States over Japanese investment in American real estate and over the
U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which was $55 billion in 1988,
according to U.S. figures.
   Bush is expected to seek a commitment from Kaifu that Japan will
broaden foreign access to Japanese business and distribution systems.
   U.S.-Japanese talks on non-tariff trade barriers are scheduled to
begin Sept. 4, but Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party is under strong
pressure at home not to make additional concessions on trade.
   The senior official said Kaifu viewed his U.S. visit as an
opportunity to explain exactly what Japan has already done to help
ease the trade deficit.
   ``What we have done is considerable, given the very fact that we
have changed our economic structure from one visibly dependent on
exports to one dependent on the domestic economy,'' he said.
   ``It will take a long time to solve the trade imbalance and in
the meantime we have to live with it,'' the official said. ``To
defuse the tension caused by the imbalance, we need a more objective
understanding of each other.''
   Foreign Ministry officials said Monday that Kaifu also would
reassure Bush and other American officials of Japan's overall
political stability.
   Japanese foreign policy initiatives have been on hold for several
months as the governing Liberal Democrats grappled with a series of
money and sex scandals and an election setback that led to two prime
ministers resigning. Kaifu is Japan's third prime minister in three
months.
   ``Mr. Kaifu will be making clear to the president that there will
be no change whatsoever in our basic position in our foreign policy
and he will continue to carry on the commitments made with President
Bush and the American government,'' said Yukio Okamoto of the
ministry's First North American Division.
   Kaifu also will use the tour, which will take him to Mexico on
Sept. 4-6 and to Canada on Sept. 7, to establish his diplomatic
credentials and enhance his stature at home, analysts say.

   Sales of new homes, bolstered by falling
mortgage rates, surged 14.4 percent in July, the fastest pace in
nearly three years, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
   The department said that new single-family homes were sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 739,000 units last month,
compared with a revised rate of 646,000 units in June.
   The advance was led by a giant 55.8 percent jump in sales in the
Northeast, a region where sales have been especially sluggish
because of high prices. But every geographic area of the country
reported good gains during the month.
   Analysts credited the advance to a sharp decline in mortgage
rates. After hitting a peak of 11.2 percent in March, fixed-rate
mortgages had fallen to an average 9.81 percent nationwide by the
end of July.
   Rates have risen slightly in recent weeks, currently averaging
10.21 percent, according to a national survey by the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Economists were split on whether this increase would continue or
whether mortgage rates would begin to drift down again in coming
months.
   David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said he looked for mortgage rates to continue creeping
up, driven by reasonably strong economic growth and continued
worries about inflationary pressures.
   But Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers
Association, predicted a resumption of modest rate declines and he
said this would act to spur further gains in sales.
   The July increase was the third in the past four months and put
sales at their highest level since December 1986, when homes were
sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 784,000 units. The 14.4
percent rise was the biggest advance since a 22.9 percent jump in
September 1986.
   The report on new home sales followed a report last Friday that
sales of existing homes also improved in July, rising by 1.2 percent
to an annual rate of 3.40 million units, the second consecutive
month that existing home sales have increased.
   The price of a new home posted a modest decline in July. The
median new-home price fell 3.7 percent to $118,800. The median is
the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less.
   Some analysts said the price drop indicated that first-time
buyers, who buy less expensive homes, are re-entering the market.
But Gramley said he also believed that the decline reflected the
fact that sellers were being forced to cut their asking prices,
especially in such high-cost areas as the Northeast.
   The 55.8 percent jump in sales in the Northeast was the biggest
one-month advance for that region since February 1982. It put sales
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 120,000 units, 15.3 percent
above where they were a year ago.
   Sales climbed 23.8 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of
125,000 units, the highest level of activity for this region since
February 1987.
   Sales in the West were up 8.9 percent to an annual rate of
232,000 units, while sales in the South rose by a more modest 2.4
percent to an annual rate of 261,000 units.

<HEAD>Conference Fails in Peace Bid, New Fighting Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international conference failed to formulate a
peace plan for Cambodia but will probably meet again next spring to
resume its work, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Delegates predicted a full-scale resumption of the guerrilla war,
with the combatants also maintaining their political contacts.
   ``There is not at this stage the possibility for movement by any
of the Cambodian factions,'' said spokesman Jean Gueguinou.
   The 19 countries at the month-long conference were to issue a
brief declaration Wednesday at the closing ministerial session, he
said, adding the conference was likely to resume in Paris ``when
conditions are right.''
   Gueguinou said a likely time was next spring.
   The issues of national reconciliation among the warring factions
and setting up a control mechanism to monitor a standdown were the
biggest stumbling blocks, he said.
   A three-party resistance led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk has been
fighting the Vietnamese-installed government of Prime Minister Hun
Sen for a decade. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978,
toppling the Khmer Rouge from a nearly four-year reign of terror.
   The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, the strongest element in the
resistance, have been the central issue of contention.
   Hun Sen has rejected Sihanouk's efforts to include the Khmer
Rouge in an interim government composed of all Cambodian factions to
preside over the country before general elections. Sihanouk has
refused to exclude them from a share of power.
   The failure to reach a settlement at the conference means there
will be no international supervision of a withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia. Vietnam has pledged to pull out its 26,000
troops by Sept. 27 even without a peace agreement.
   Hun Sen has rejected any monitoring force under the United
Nations, which recognizes Sihanouk's coalition as legitimate
government of Cambodia.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and his Indonesian
counterpart, Ali Alatas, conference co-chairmen, decided that
compromise was impossible among the four Cambodian factions despite
``intensive consultations'' Tuesday, Gueguinou said.
   ``It was too early to reach a compromise but not too early to
work,'' he said. When the conference resumes, ``it will start with
considerable work behind it.''
   It had been widely speculated that the conference would fail in
its goal to reach a comprehensive settlement to the conflict in
Cambodia, which has endured two decades of bloodshed and turmoil.
   ``We are deadlocked here because the military situation is not
decisive,'' said a spokesman for Sihanouk's delegation, Ek
Saraywath. ``If there is no result on the battlefield, there is no
result at the negotiating table.''
   ``We may be moving into a period where ... things will go back to
the ground, to the battlefield,'' a senior U.S. official said,
demanding he not be further identified. ``There may be a period now
of some months of testing of the military balance on the ground.''
   Reports of battlefield action have increased over the past three
weeks. Western analysts attributed the renewed fighting to a
jockeying for power before the resumption in Paris of the final
ministerial session.
   ``Hun Sen thinks he can still win the war. That is why he has
made no concessions here,'' Ek said. ``When he sees that he is weak,
he will negotiate.''
   In three or four months, ``we'll see who has the advantage,'' he
said.
   The U.S. official said there was ``great uncertainty'' about the
real strength of the Khmer Rouge, and that a period of military
testing may determine who has the upper hand in any future
negotiations.
   The official refused to comment on whether the United States
could supply lethal aid to the resistance should fighting flare
again. President Bush had been pressing for aid to the two
non-communist elements of the resistance.
   ``We assume at the minimum there will be a very substantial
supply of armaments'' by Vietnam to Hun Sen's forces, he said.

<HEAD>New Attacks on Ousted Party Chief; Possible Prelude to Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official press broadened accusations Tuesday
against ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, saying the
reform-minded leader inspired attacks on government offices during
the spring democracy movement.
   The new attacks by two newspapers were a possible prelude to
prosecuting Zhao in what would be the first trial of a party leader
in nearly a decade.
   The newspapers said Zhao was directly responsible for massive
student marches, attacks on government offices and establishment of
illegal groups during the democracy movement through neglect of
political and ideological education.
   ``Zhao Ziyang ... proposed diluting the function of the party,''
said Economic Information. ``(He) denied the superior tradition of
the party (and) canceled the work of political education.''
   A commentary in the party newspaper, the People's Daily, said
Zhao bolstered flagging protests in Shanxi province when he told a
visiting delegation on May 4 that the government should open
dialogue with the students.
   His comments, the paper said, resulted in daily marches of tens
of thousands of people, the establishment of more than 60 illegal
organizations, attacks on provincial offices and the disruption of a
major international trade fair by thousands of students.
   Economic Information said students influenced by Zhao attacked
the socialist system at a discussion session last year with
education officials, and questioned the need for political
education. The students called ideological workers ``glib talkers
propagating dog philosophy,'' the paper said.
   Zhao was stripped of his party posts in late June after losing a
power struggle over handling of the seven-week democracy movement.
He was accused then of splitting the party and supporting the
protests.
   Since then, government officials have said the investigation into
Zhao is continuing but have refused to say if the party charges will
be turned into legal charges.
   Zhao has not been seen in public since late May, when he spoke
tearfully to students occupying Tiananmen Square. Some unofficial
reports say he is under house arrest, but government spokesman Yuan
Mu recently said Zhao was leading a normal life.
   The media have carried sporadic criticism of Zhao for weeks. But
the recent attacks have been notable for their length, detail and
specific references to damage Zhao allegedly caused by his erroneous
thinking and leadership, including leading ``vast numbers'' of
people astray.
   The commentaries may be an effort to prepare the public for the
first trial of a top party leader since the 1980 trial of the Gang
of Four, the leaders of the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution.
   Economic Information said Zhao neglected ideological work and
encouraged ``bourgeois-liberal,'' or Western, thought.
   A Worker's Daily commentary Saturday said Zhao elevated the role
of entrepreneurs while belittling workers, who should be considered
the force behind socialist modernization.
   Worker's Daily said Zhao missed the point of China's economic
reform policies of the past decade, which was to show the
superiority of socialism.
   ``Zhao Ziyang often told some people that capitalism actually was
better and our socialist system had problems,'' it said.
   A military assault on Beijing quashed the student demonstration,
killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.

   A couple claimed Illinois' biggest single-winner
lottery jackpot _ $42 million _ and said Tuesday their priorities
are a quiet vacation and some investments.
   ``Like everyone else, we'd mapped out what we'd do if we won,''
said William Madigan. ``But today I can't remember a single thing we
talked about. My mind's a blank.''
   Madigan, 50, and his wife, Kathleen, 38, claimed the jackpot from
Saturday's Lotto drawing. They live in suburban Hometown with her
three children. The Madigans will receive 20 annual payments of $2.1
million.
   ``It's really very frightening, but at the same time it's a lot
of fun,'' Mrs. Madigan said. The couple said they hadn't given much
thought to spending the money beyond plans to buy a new car, remodel
their home and travel.
   Madigan, a supervisor for a security company, plans to keep his
job at least through the end of the year. Mrs. Madigan, a gift shop
clerk, said she will quit to spend more time with her children.
   The state's biggest jackpot is $69.9 million, awarded in an April
15 drawing, but that prize was divided among four ticket holders.
Illinois' ,biggest previous single-winner jackpot was $40 million,
won in 1984.

<HEAD>Czechoslovak Dissident Convicted for Incitement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Czechoslovak court Tuesday convicted a
leading dissident of inciting rebellion and sentenced him to 20
months in prison, emigre and human rights sources said.
   The dissident, Stanislav Devaty, called the proceedings a
political trial that violated his freedom of speech, an emigre
source said on condition of anonymity.
   Defense attorney Jiri Machourek immediately appealed the
conviction, calling the proceedings unfair, according to the emigre
source, as well as Charter 77 human rights activist Dana Nemcova.
They said they were citing reports from friends of Devaty who
attended the trial.
   Devaty, 37, is a Charter 77 member who last year served as the
group's spokesman.
   The trial was held at Gottwaldov, about 125 miles east of Prague.
   Devaty was tried in connection with a petition signed by more
than 400 people calling for more religious and cultural freedom and
the release of all political prisoners. The petition was sent late
last year to the government, which made no response.
   One of the most active of Czechoslovakia's dissidents, Devaty has
been detained several times this year and released after hunger
strikes.
   Devaty initially was detained March 16 in a mass crackdown on
dissent that also put playwright Vaclav Havel and other leading
activists in jail. He was last detained Aug. 7.
   The emigre source said only five friends of Devaty were allowed
into the courtroom. Most of the 30 people attending were hired by
the government to keep out Devaty supporters, she said.
   Also present were representatives of the U.S. and Canadian
embassies, she said.
   Machourek said the evidence presented should have been
insufficent to reach a verdict, because none of the witnesses said
Devaty wrote the petition, according to the emigre source.

   Two mathematicians who set a record in June by
calculating pi to 480 million decimal places have extended the mark
to over 1 billion places, IBM announced Tuesday.
   The work was done by Columbia University researchers Gregory and
David Chudnovsky on two supercomputers at IBM's Thomas J. Watson
Research Center in Yorktown Heights, the company said.
   The new mark of 1,011,196,691 digits appears to be a world
record, said Denis Arvay, spokesman for the International Business
Machines Corp.
   ``They're starting more calculations, so it goes on from here,''
Arvay said Tuesday. `I don't know when they're going to stop.''
   Peter Renz, associate director of the Mathematical Association of
America, said he had not heard of anybody exceeding the researchers'
mark.
   Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
The infinite string of digits begins with 3.14159, and contains no
obvious pattern.
   The 480 million digits the Chudnovsky brothers calculated in June
would stretch for 600 miles if printed.
   At the time, David Chudnovsky said calculating pi to such lengths
is useful for testing the performance of computer hardware and
software. He called the task ``the ultimate stress test.''
   The calculations also let researchers investigate whether the
string of digits is random or contains some undiscovered pattern, he
said.

<HEAD>Despite Controversy, Support for Generic Drugs Reaffirmed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the scandal enveloping the generic drug
industry, consumer advocates and physicians on Tuesday reaffirmed
their confidence in lower-priced clones of brand-name medicines.
   ``At the present time, there's no evidence that any generic drugs
out there in the pharmacies lack safety or effectiveness,'' said Dr.
Sidney Wolfe, a physician and head of the Public Citizen Health
Research Group.
   Although disclosures of fraud and corruption in the Food and Drug
Administration's generic drug division have tainted the agency's
reputation and cast doubts about the industry, many say concerns
about the safety of generic drugs are overblown.
   ``What we've seen in the past few weeks is regrettable but I
don't think it reflects all generics and it really hasn't changed my
prescribing habits,'' said Dr. Ray W. Gifford, a trustee of the
American Medical Association who is also an interist at the
Cleveland Clinic and a clinical pharmacologist.
   In the past month, the FDA has initiated steps to withdraw from
the market products manufactured by several generic drug companies,
including two that have admitted wrongoing in the growing scandal.
   In the latest move, the FDA on Monday said it wants to remove
from the market Bolar Pharmaceuticals Co. Inc.'s generic version of
Dyazide, a popular drug used to treat high blood pressure. The FDA
said it found no evidence of fraud, and the Copiague, N.Y.-based
Bolar said the problem stems from confusion over a clerical error in
identifying samples used in safety tests.
   Last week, the agency said it wants to remove from the market
three products made by Par Pharmaceuticals of Spring Valley, N.Y.,
and 25 made by Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens,
N.Y. Par and a company executive have pleaded guilty to paying
illegal gratuities to FDA chemists, and Vitarine has admitted that
it submitted false samples for safety tests.
   Also last week, the FDA expanded federal inspections of 11
generic drug makers to include the plants of 20 additional generic
firms. The agency said it was ``a further effort by the FDA to
assure the public of both the safety and the efficacy of the
generic-drug supply in the United States.''
   The concerns question the ability of generic products to work as
effectively as the brand-name drug _ whether they are absorbed into
the body at the same rate as the original drug.
   Wolfe, head of the Nader consumer health group, said these
potency problems are rarely of any significance. In most cases, he
pointed out, doctors prescribe the same dose of medicine to a
125-pound adult as to a 250-pound adult.
   ``For most drugs, there is a wide range over which the drug will
be effective and safe,'' he said. ``This cuts through a lot of the
extent to which people are overreacting to the problems that have
been brought to light.''
   While Wolfe defends the general safety and efficacy of generic
drugs, he is sharply critical of the FDA for ``creating an
atmosphere of lawlessness'' with lax enforcement of the regulations
governing drug approvals.
   He is more concerned about the safety of new brand-name drugs
than generic compounds because ``the record shows that every major
prescription drug disaster in this country is related to a newly
marketed brand-name drug.''
   Generic drugs, copies of brand-name medicines that are usually
more expensive, have long been controversial, but have become well
accepted by consumers and physicians. A third of all prescriptions
written in the United States are filled with generic drugs,
according to the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association.
   While generics are seen by some as money-saving alternatives,
others, including some brand-name companies, claim generics are less
effective than their trade-name counterparts.
   ``Most physicians can tell you that there are certain situations
in which they would insist on trade-name drugs,'' said Gifford of
the AMA. He said he referred to conditions such as congestive heart
failure that are difficult to treat.
   Jay Molishever, a spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical
Industry Association, noted that generic drugs ``have been subject
to constant continuing scrutiny throughout their existance'' and
that the results have shown generics to have ``an extraordinary
record of safety and efficacy.''

   Syrian gunners shelled an oil tanker bound
for a Christian port Tuesday and set it ablaze, killing seven
crewmen and starting an artillery duel that took three more lives,
police reported.
   They said the Maltese-flag Sunshield was hit at 2:30 a.m., seven
miles off the Christian-held Maameltein area 11 miles north of
Beirut, while trying to run the Syrian artillery blockade under
cover of darkness. It carried 550,000 gallons of gasoline.
   Johannes Garabedian, the Lebanese captain, was among the dead;
coast guard vessels rescued two wounded crew members; two others
were missing and feared dead, the police reported. They said the
seven badly burned bodies washed ashore several hours after the
tanker was hit.
   Police reported three people killed and 16 wounded in the ensuing
five-hour artillery exchange between Syrian army gunners and
Christian army units led by Gen. Michel Aoun. Three of the wounded
were Moslem firemen hit when an 82mm mortar round exploded in the
parking lot of a west Beirut fire station.
   At least 802 people have been killed and 2,268 wounded, nearly
all of them civilians, since fighting began March 8 between Aoun's
men and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in
Lebanon.
   A police spokesman said the Sunshield was hit by at least one
shell from radar-controlled Syrian howitzers deployed along the
seafront in Moslem west Beirut.
   Hanna Saddiq, 24, said at a hospital in Christian east Beirut the
tanker was set ablaze by missiles fired from a Syrian gunboat that
intercepted it.
   ``The Syrian captain ordered us through a bullhorn to identify
ourselves and our cargo. Our captain did not reply,'' said Saddiq,
who was being treated for severe burns.
   ``All our crew were hiding behind sandbags placed on the bridge
to protect us from Syrian shelling. The Syrian gunboat sailed away
and then fired several missiles that hit the bridge, starting the
fire.''
   If Saddiq's report is correct, it would be the first time a
Syrian warship fired on a cargo vessel since the fighting began
nearly six months ago. They usually order intercepted ships to turn
back.
   Police insisted the Sunshield was hit by artillery fire from west
Beirut directed by Syrian radars in mountains overlooking the coast.
   ``What probably happened is that the gunboat pulled away, as they
usually do, leaving it to be hit by shellfire,'' said the police
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules.
   He said the radar-controlled howitzers opened fire soon after the
tanker entered Lebanese waters.
   A tug managed to tow the stricken ship to within a half-mile of
the coast and firemen extinguished the blaze 12 hours after it
hegan, the police said.
   A security source said privately the Christians might be trying
to blame the attack on a Syrian gunboat in hopes of getting French
naval protection for blockade runners.
   The tanker attack coincided with a visit by French envoy Francois
Scheer for talks with Christian and Moslem leaders on how to end one
of the worst episodes in a 14-year-old sectarian civil war that has
killed more than 150,000 people.
   Syrian soldiers are in the country under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after the war began.
Aoun calls them an occupation force and has declared a ``war of
liberation'' to drive them out.
   France, which governed Lebanon by mandate until 1943, has a
six-ship flotilla in the eastern Mediterranean. It says the warships
are on a humanitarian mission to evacuate the 7,000 French citizens
in Lebanon if necessary.
   After the Sunshield was hit, police said, Aoun's 155mm howitzers
opened fire on Syrian artillery positions in west Beirut to ``cover
coast guard boats trying to rescue the tanker.''
   Syrian gunners responded and shells began falling on Christian
and Moslem neighborhoods.
   Seven other cargo ships trying to reach Christian ports have been
hit by Syrian gunfire since March 16. At least two seamen have been
killed.
   Scheer, secretary-general of the French Foreign Ministry, arrived
in Beirut from two days of talks with Syrian leaders in Damascus. He
met with Aoun for three hours Tuesday in the general's bunker under
the presidential palace at Baabda, a Christian suburb, and told
reporters:
   He later crossed the sectarian dividing line for meetings with
Moslem leaders, including acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, head of
a Moslem cabinet that competes for authority with the Christian
government led by Aoun.
   Diplomatic sources said Scheer's plan includes a cease-fire,
embargo on arms deliveries to warring factions, political reforms to
distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems, and
withdrawal of foreign forces.

<HEAD>Hungarian Activists Fined And Expelled From Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Hungarians were fined and
expelled from the country Tuesday for their part in an
anti-government demonstration on the anniversary of the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Gyorgy Kerenyi and Tamas Deutsch were found guilty of breach of
public order and fined $500 each, witnesses said. Western reporters
were not admitted into the proceedings at Prague District Court.
   Deutsch and Kerenyi had been in detention since they were
arrested by plainclothes police on Prague's central Wenceslas Square
Aug. 21. They had gathered a crowd of people around them and were
protesting the 1968 Soviet-led invasion.
   ``Bolsheviks came with tanks, we came with flowers,'' read their
banner rejecting Hungarian participation in the invasion. Kerenyi
delivered an emotional speech demanding liberal reforms in
Czechoslovakia similar to those underway in Hungary.
   The crowd applauded, shouted ``Long Live Hungary!'' and chanted
for freedom before uniformed police moved in to break up the protest.
   An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Czechoslovaks then marched around
Prague for another two hours, calling for freedom and the withdrawal
of Soviet troops.
   Czechoslovak party leader Milos Jakes, echoing other party
officials, condemned the incident as ``interference in Czechoslovak
internal affairs by tourists in disguise.''
   Seven other Hungarians were among the 50 foreigners and 320
Czechoslovaks detained during the Aug. 21 demonstration. All the
others detained were released by last Thursday.
   ``I don't think we did anything wrong,'' Peter Molnar, a leading
official of the Hungarian youth group FIDESZ, said outside court
during the all-day trial, to which only Hungarian and Czechoslovak
journalists were admitted.
   ``If armies and tanks come to another country to change things,
that's interference, not if young people come with flowers and
express their views,'' he added.
   The fines were immediately paid by the Hungarian consul to
Prague, Lajos Taba, and both activists were driven to the airport.
   The charges against them carried a maximum penalty of six months
in jail and a fine of $2,000, or both.
   In Budapest, a group of Hungarians camped out in front of the
Czechoslovak Embassy ended a hunger strike they began last week to
protest the detention of the two activists in Prague.

<HEAD>Bush Renews Commitment to Help Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, wrapping up work on a
new U.S. drug strategy, said Tuesday his administration will
``cooperate to the best of our ability'' on Colombia's request for
an extra $19 million to fight drug kingpins.
   In a meeting with top policy advisers, Bush put new focus on the
``Andean strategy'' to fight drugs in South American countries that
are the source of illicit narcotics, said national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft. The adviser said, however, it was too early to
comment on Colombia's request for another $19 million, on top of the
$65 million Bush already has approved.
   Bush also declined to comment directly on the request, advanced
in Washington by Colombian justice minister Monica de Greiff, and
said details of the aid are ``being worked out now'' in discussions
with the Colombians.
   The president made the comments to reporters after a strategy
review with top Cabinet advisers, including the attorney general and
secretary of defense, on a revamped anti-drug plan that he will
announce in a nationally broadcast White House address Sept. 5.
   Scowcroft said after the meeting that Bush is adjusting his
strategy to respond to the heightened drug crisis in Colombia. Drug
lords there have launched a series of attacks and threaten to kill
more judges in retaliation for extradition of any drug trafficking
suspects.
   He indicated that new focus would be put on the ``Andean
strategy'' to provide aid to interdict cocaine in the source
countries of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia.
   Vacationing at his seaside home on the Maine coast, Bush summoned
his Cabinet advisers involved in the international component of the
$8 billion anti-drug strategy to be unveiled in a week.
   Asked Mrs. de Greiff's request for $19 million in additional aid,
Bush would not comment directly. But he said: ``We will cooperate
with Colombia to the best of our of our ability. I support what the
president of that country has been trying to do. and everyone of our
cabinet officers here, all of us, agree that this is important
step.''
   He said he had ``great respect'' for Colombian President Virgilio
Barco's call for foreign drug users to help curb demand for drugs.
This demand, Barco said, is destroying his country.
   Asked about reports that Bush's anti-drug strategy would include
$300 million in economic and military aid for the Andean countries,
Scowcroft told reporters that figure had already been adjusted
upward by $65 million with the president's announcement of
additional helicopters and equipment aid for Colombia last week.
   He indicated there could be further adjustments in the figure,
but gave no specifics.
   In Washington, there were these related developments:
   _At the Pentagon, a spokesman said that distribution of the $65
million worth of U.S. military aid was awaiting a detailed list of
needs from Colombian officials.
   ``When the list is returned to the United States delivery will
begin,'' Pete Williams told reporters.
   Williams said the United States sent Colombia a list of equipment
available for immediate transfer from Defense Department stocks
after Bush granted the aid. The Colombians, in turn, issued their
list of requests.
   Williams declined to say what type of equipment would be
provided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons,
ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medical
supplies.
   _Mrs. de Greiff, holding a news conference at the Colombian
Embassy, vowed to stay on the job, saying ``the law is under siege
in Colombia and we must protect it every way we can.''
   ``I never considered resigning,'' she said in response to a
question about such reports. ``The threats are out there, but I am
satisfied with my protection right now.''
   In the session with reporters covering the vacationing president
in Maine, Scowcroft noted that the primary focus of Bush's anti-drug
strategy will be on the domestic aspects, including law enforcement
assistance, education and treatment programs.
   Bush called the meeting at his Walker's Point home where he has
been vacationing since Aug. 16. Arriving from Washington, in
addition to Scowcroft, were Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger, national drug policy coordinator William Bennett, White
House chief of staff John Sununu and CIA Director William Webster.
   Scowcroft said de Greiff's request for more money was not
discussed at the president's meeting because officials had just
learned of it in reports from Washington.
   ``We're now in discussions with the Colombians over the $65
million package. We put it together based on ... what we thought
that the Colombians would need in order to undertake the operatiosn
that they have in mind,'' he said. ``They're now discussing with us
the kind of things they think they need.''
   Scowcroft said ``it's not clear to me'' what de Greiff's extra
$19 million would be for. But he added that he was not ruling out
the possibility of more aid than the $65 million Bush is providing
from an emergency assistance fund.
   In addition, the administration has announced a $5 million
package of security assistance to help protect the Colombian judges
who are a principle target of drug assassins.
   On a related matter, Scowcroft said ``it's possible'' that some
drug traffickers wanted for extradition to the United States have
taken refuge in Panama, where a Sept. 1 deadline for installation of
a new government comes up this week.
   There is no government to install, however, because the country's
de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, invalidated last May's
elections, after first allegdly rigging them to his advantage.
   Scowcroft said the administration would ``have something to say''
about the administraion's position position relative to Panama this
week.
   De Greiff indicated the $19 million she was seeking would be for
bullet proof cars and other protective measures for the judicial
officials.
   Scowcroft lauded the Colombian government for ``bravely standing
up'' to the drug traffickers who are waging a war of violence and
assassination on government officials.
   ``We want to do everything we can to help the Colombians,'' he
said.
   He said Bush also would raise the drug issue with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, when Mulroney arrives Wednesday for a
two-day private visit with the president here. Scowcroft said Bush
will likely ask the Canadians to get involved in the anti-drug
effort in South America.
   Bush already had approved the major planks of his new anti-drug
strategy. But a draft of his Sept. 5 television address being
circulated in the administration contained blanks on some details,
including what he will say on Colombia, one official said. The
address will be Bush's first televised speech to the nation from the
White House.
   Bush returns to Washington a day before, after nearly three weeks
on vacation here.

<HEAD>Price Supports to be Cut by Maximum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal price support for soybeans grown
this year will be reduced 5 percent to $4.53 per bushel from $4.77
in 1988, the maximum reduction allowed by law, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday.
   Yeutter said the decision was a preliminary one and the final
1989 soybean support rate will be announced by Oct. 1.
   The reduction in the support rate was required by a formula in
the 1985 farm law. But the law says the support cannot be cut more
than 5 percent in any single year and in no event can be lowered
below $4.50 per bushel.
   Agriculture Department economists have forecast that soybean
prices during the 1989-90 marketing year beginning Sept. 1 may
average $4.75 to $6 per bushel, compared with $7.35 in the current
year.
   There is no direct relationship between the market price and the
price support in a given year.
   Soybean production is expected to be up sharply this this year to
an estimated 1.9 billion bushels from 1.54 billion in 1988 when
drought reduced yields.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Reports Pirate Attack, Nearly 150 Believed Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thai fishermen attacked and sank a boat
carrying about 150 Vietnamese refugees, and nearly everyone on board
was believed dead, a witness told authorities.
   Lt. Col. Prakob Benjapong, deputy chief of the Songkhla marine
police, said the witness told him the refugees left Vietnam on June
15 in a boat headed for Malaysia.
   He said the witness, Pham Hong Cuc, 17, reported the boat was
attacked two days later by two Thai fishing vessels.
   She told him that two fishermen armed with knives boarded the
Vietnamese boat and robbed its passengers, and then they took her,
10 older women and three boys aboard their own boats.
   She said the pirates then rammed the Vietnamese boat six or seven
times and sank it. About half of those on board disappeared as soon
as the boat went down, she said, and the rest were believed to have
drowned later.
   The refugee said she and the 10 women were kept on one of the
fishing boats for about a week, raped by five of eight fishermen,
and later thrown overboard.
   She said someone on a passing boat threw her a buoy but refused
to take her aboard. A Thai fishing boat finally brought her ashore
June 28.
   The police officer said she had been living with the family of
one of the fishermen and only recently decided to tell police in the
southern town of Pattani about the attack.
   Prakob said there were no reports about the fate of the other
Vietnamese taken aboard the fishing boats.
   Pirates have been attacking boat people in the Gulf of Thailand
and the South China Sea since the refugees began fleeing their
homeland following the Communist takeover in 1975.
   Prakob said the latest attack was the 48th reported this year.
Police so far have arrested 14 suspects in connection with six other
cases, he said.
   On Mindoro Island in the Philippines, a vessel carrying 111
Vietnamese refugees landed at a fishing village, said Cid Enriquez,
spokeswoman of the Intergovernment Committee on Migration.
   She said the boat people who arrived in Paluan brought to 265 the
number of refugees who came ashore in the Philippines over the past
week.

   Unfriendly reaction prompted the Highway
Commission on Tuesday to drop the idea of putting ``The Friendship
State'' on Texas license plates.
   The commission decided instead to add just the red, white and
blue state flag to the plate, which already carries a Texas map.
   On July 19, the three-member commission approved, with little
fanfare, what seemed an innocuous proposal to use ``The Friendship
State'' on the 27 million Texas license plates, hoping the cheery
message would attract tourists.
   The slogan became the topic of radio call-in shows, newspaper
surveys and coffee shop banter.
   ``It's wimpy,'' said Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, a candidate
for the Democratic nomination for governor.
   Many suggested ``The Lone Star State'' instead. A newspaper
survey came up with such suggestions as the ``Bank Failure State,''
``Don't Mess With Texas'' and ``Pinhead Legislature.''

<HEAD>59 More Killed in Sinhalese Violence in Sri Lanka</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attackers dragged 14 men from their
homes Tuesday and killed them, part of a new wave of Sinhalese
violence that left 59 people dead, officials and witnesses said.
   The reports came on the second day of a weeklong strike called by
the radicals to protest what they call genocide of their supporters
by the government.
   In Colombo, most shops, offices and businesses were open, but
only about 30 percent of government employees reported for work, an
official said.
   Residents of the village of Pandura, south of Colombo, said 14
Sinhalese men were pulled from of their homes before dawn and shot
by people wearing army-style uniforms.
   The Sinhalese-dominated government is fighting to put down a
violent campaign by Sinhalese radicals opposed to official peace
overtures toward ethnic Tamil rebels.
   The attack in Panadura followed another killing in the area
Sunday, when suspected Sinhalese radicals slayed a soldier and four
members of her family, residents reported.
   Military officials, who may not be identified under briefing
rules, confirmed 14 bodies were found near Panadura on Tuesday. But
they denied that army personnel were responsible for the deaths.
   The officials said at least 25 other bodies were found elsewhere
in the Sinhalese-dominated south and center of Sri Lanka.
   In addition, residents near the Kalu Ganga River, about 25 miles
south of Colombo, said 11 bodies had been thrown into the river.
Military officials did not mention those bodies.
   Scores of such unidentified bodies have been found in recent
weeks.
   Opposition politicians and human rights groups say such bodies
are of suspected radicals killed in revenge attacks by security
forces or pro-government vigilante groups.
   In other violence, the military officials said at least nine
people were killed in several attacks by the radicals during the 24
hours ending Tuesday evening.
   They said the victims included a former government lawmaker and
four of her bodyguards, two lawyers, and two policemen.
   At least 5,000 people have been killed in Sinhalese violence
since the radicals launched their anti-government campaign in July
1987.
   They say the government should be tougher in trying to end a
6-year-old Tamil insurgency in northeastern Sri Lanka. They also
claim that the presence of Indian peacekeeping troops, who have
tried unsuccessfully to end the Tamil uprising, compromises Sri
Lanka's sovereignty.
   In the Sinhalese general strike, radical groups had announced in
posters pasted on walls in the capital that employees could go to
their jobs but should refuse to work.
   Steel-helmeted policemen and soldiers in camouflage uniforms were
posted in Colombo and other major cities to ward off any attacks by
the radicals.

   Soldiers and Moslem guerrillas fought
in several provincial cities Tuesday and 10 rockets hit the capital,
the government said.
   Rival guerrilla groups were reported fighting each other in
northern and western Afghanistan.
   In a speech to the opening session of Parliament, President Najib
asked the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to stop
interfering in Afghanistan. The three nations are the guerrillas'
main backers.
   Government spokesman Mohammed Iqbal said one of the rockets
struck a house, wounding two people inside, and seven hit the
airport but caused no injuries.
   Employees and passengers fled the combined civilian-military
airport and passengers were told to return Wednesday for their
luggage, which was being unloaded when the rockets landed about 100
yards away.
   Iqbal said the level of fighting between the army and guerrillas
in three eastern cities had declined in recent days, and rocket
barrages had replaced close combat.
   Soldiers advanced east of Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul, and
parried a guerrilla advance on Khost, about 100 miles to the
southeast, he said. Iqbal also claimed government troops won
victories around Kandahar in the southeast.
   He reported fighting between guerrilla factions around the
western city of Herat and in the northern provinces of Badakhshan,
Takhar and Konduz.
   The government spokesman and independent sources said the battles
were between two fundamentalist groups _ Hezb-i-Islami led by
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Jamiat-i-Islami fighters under field
commander Ahmad Shah Masood.
   At least 22 guerrillas were killed and an unknown number wounded
in the foothills and mountains 50 miles east of Herat, Iqbal said.
   He said he did not have statistics for the other areas. The
independent sources in Kabul said serious trouble appeared to be
developing between the rival groups.
   Jamiat leaders accused Hekmatyar last month of ordering the
killings of at least 30 of its guerrillas in the field, including
some commanders.
   Najib resumed his call for U.N.-supervised elections and said to
Parliament: ``The aggressive hand of the United States, Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan should be off Afghanistan.''
   In a weekend speech in Jalalabad, released in English on Tuesday,
Najib said the fighting had changed from a jihad, or holy war, to
fratricide.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978. Soviet military forces entered the war in December 1979 and
withdrew in February after more than nine years of involvement.
   The main guerrilla groups are based in Pakistan, Afghanistan's
eastern neighbor.

<HEAD>US Recalls Ambassador To Protest Treatment Of Ethnic Turks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lede to CORRECT that U.S. joined NATO condemnation, rather
than urging allies to condemn Bulgaria.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declaring that Bulgaria's Turkish minority was
trapped in a ``tragic situation'' of human rights violations, the
Bush administration announced Monday it had recalled the American
ambassador to the East European country and joined NATO allies in
condeming Bulgaria.
   A strong statement issued at the State Department followed what a
U.S. official said was a recent worsening of the situation and an
inability by Turkey to absorb many more than the 311,000 ethnic
Turks who have taken refuge in the country.
   While estimates vary, about 1 million people of Turkish
extraction live in Bulgaria where, according to the State
Department, they are systematically denied the right to speak the
Turkish language and practice Turkish culture.
   The Turkish government recently required visas of ethnic Turks
emigrating from Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government accused Turkey of
hypocrisy.
   Turkish border officials said they had strict orders to turn away
the refugees waiting to cross into Turkey. However, the
semi-official Turkish news agency Anatolia said hundreds were
allowed to enter without visas last week.
   Turkish opposition parties accused the government of backing away
from its pledge to accept all ethnic Turks who wanted to come, while
Bulgaria blamed Turkey for refusing to hold talks on an immigration
agreement.
   The Turkish ethnics, with strong U.S. support, accused Bulgaria
of forcible assimilation, beginning in 1974, that made practicing
Islamic rites more difficult.
   ``The situation just continues to get worse,'' said Richarrd
Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said. ``Repression
continues.''
   He said Ambassador Sol Polansky had been recalled from Sofia
``for consultations'' and that the Bush administration was
considering assistance for the refugees.
   ``The ongoing abuse of the human rights of Bulgarian ethnic Turks
by the government of Bulgaria remains an issue of serious concern to
the U.S. government,'' the statement said.
   ``The U.S. has made its views on this matter known to the
government of Bulgaria both publicly and privately, and President
Bush has spoken several times to Turkish leaders to express our
strong support for their efforts to end this tragic situation,'' the
spokesman said.
   Simeon Darpatov, spokesman for the Bulgarian embassy, denied the
allegations. He said Turkey had set preconditions for discussing the
problem with his government, including recognition of a distinct
Turkish ethnic group in Bulgaria.
   ``There should be a dialogue between the two neighoring countries
and we are not pleased when other countries interfere in bilateral
relations,'' Darpatov said.
   The Bulgarian diplomat said ``nobody has been persecuted for his
religion'' in the country.
   Darpatov said his government, in accord with the 1975 Helsinki
accords, permits all of its citizens to travel abroad.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Calls on U.S. to Help End Lebanon War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem chief Nabih Berri said
Tuesday that to solve the hostage crisis, the United States should
help end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   ``My advise to the Americans and everyone is to help resolve the
Lebanese problem,'' Berri told reporters representing foreign media
at his heavily fortified office in west Beirut.
   ``They have to go to the core of the problem in order to be able
to help resolve the hostage problem,'' Berri said.
   At least 802 people have been killed and 2,268 wounded, nearly
all of them civilians, since the latest outbreak in the civil war
began March 8 between Christian forces and a Moslem alliance led by
the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon.
   Berri, leader of the moderate, Syrian-backed Amal movement, also
said the hostage issue was linked to the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon.
   The Israeli army withdrew from Lebanon in 1985 after a three-year
occupation but set up a self-designated security zone in the south,
six to 10 miles deep, as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla
attacks into northern Israel.
   ``Why was it before 1982 that we didn't hear of any kidnapping?''
Berri asked. ``Because before 1982 we didn't have the Israeli
invasion. All that happened to Lebanon came after that date.''
   Sixteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon. Most are believed held
by pro-Iranian, Shiite extremist groups. They include eight
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, one Italian and one
Irishman.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Amal is not involved in seizing hostages. The hostage-holding
groups are believed to come under the umbrella of Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   Berri and Sheik Abbas Mousawi of Hezbollah on Thursday announced
the end of 16 months of intermittent clashes between their rival
factions for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest
sect.
   The feud killed nearly 575 people and wounded more than 1,550, by
police count.
   Mousawi said the ``mission for Amal and Hezbollah now is to
jointly confront the new Crusaders' invasion.''
   He referred to a French naval buildup in the eastern
Mediterranean, which the Shiites claim was designed to support
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun in his confrontation with
Syria and its Moslem militia allies.

<TEXT>
   A woman who settled a crack debt by allowing her
13-year-old daughter to be raped was sentenced to life in prison
Tuesday.
   ``The child is grateful her pain is finally over,'' prosecutor
Kelly Ramsey said after the sentencing. ``She can begin rebuilding
herself.''
   Susan Barbier, 29, was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual
conduct, the charge for rape in Michigan, for giving her daughter to
a man who raped her twice.
   The crime normally carries 10 to 25 years in prison, but Circuit
Judge James J. Rashid said Barbier gave ``flagrantly false
testimony'' at her trial and showed no potential for reform.
   The man who raped the girl, Anthony Sawyer, 28, was convicted of
the same charge and was sentenced Thursday by another judge to 40 to
60 years in prison.
   Barbier had maintained her innocence at all times and had also
claimed that she had been punished enough because her children had
been taken from her.
   ``That is not a punishment for someone with such little regard
for her children,'' Rashid told her. ``Your daughter trusted you and
you abused that trust beyond all bounds of decency.''
   Ramsey said Barbier's daughter called the 1988 rape ``the worst
hour of my life.'' According to testimony by Sawyer, Barbier offered
her daughter to satisfy a drug debt, then smoked crack with Sawyer
afterward.
   Barbier is eligible for parole in 10 years.
   Her former husband, Michael Dare, has been granted temporary
custody of the victim. Two other children, ages 6 and 8, are staying
with a relative.
   ``This case demonstrates tragically the far-reaching impact of
drugs on innocent people,'' the judge said. ``I have not heard of
such a situation where drugs were responsible for a mother
subjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse.''

   Voyager 2 cruised away from Neptune and
toward the stars Tuesday, completing an $865 million trek past 60
worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent
destruction of their own planet.
   ``If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds,''
said Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, a member of the team
that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its
twin, Voyager 1.
   ``Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our
origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.''
   As scientists held a final news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the
one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from Earth and 4.2 million
miles beyond Neptune, the solar system's fourth-largest and
currently most-distant planet.
   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path
that took it from Earth in 1977, past Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in
1981 and Uranus in 1986, and now past Neptune in search of the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn
in 1980.
   For $865 million _ 20 cents per year per American since the
project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at
least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and
examining worlds of wonder, like Jupiter's moon Io, with its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at Neptune have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
Voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its
journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project
scientist Edward Stone. ``For those of us fortunate enough to be
involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   At Neptune, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to Nereid
and Triton, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.
   The spacecraft detected in Neptune's bluish atmosphere an
Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph
winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,
pinkish Triton. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep
craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced
ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more
recently than a half billion years ago, said U.S. Geological Survey
geologist Laurence Soderblom.
   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than
initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.
   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager
photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look
as it would to someone standing on Triton's surface and seeing the
crater in three dimensions.
   Scientists also presented new findings Tuesday showing Neptune's
weak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet
but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the
planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may
exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as
inside the Earth.
   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of
Captain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of Magellan,'' said
Planetary Society vice president Bruce Murray, former director of
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``The discoveries challenge our
imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their
grandchildren.''
   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human
masters to the vulnerability of Earth, a tiny garden threatened by
nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone
shield.
   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''
Sagan said.
   He said Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first warned of
depletion of Earth's ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to
help NASA understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works at
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, Sagan said.
   From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the
runaway ``greenhouse effect'' on Venus, where thick clouds trap
solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.
   Sagan said Voyager also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks
to answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, how
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at Neptune until Oct. 2. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and
searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the
probes can continue transmitting data until 2020.

<HEAD>Net Farm Income Should Be Better Than Expected This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cash receipts from larger crops this year are
boosting net farm income more sharply than had been expected, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said that nationally
net farm income could rise more than 10 percent this year to between
$48 billion and $53 billion, $1 billion more than forecast in July.
Last year's net income was around $44 billion, and the record was
$47 billion in 1987.
   As used by the agency, net farm income includes the value of
agricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm, and
allowances for family dwellings and other adjustments, minus total
operating expenses.
   In another method of accounting, the report said this year's net
cash income ``could fall from last year's record $60 billion.'' Net
cash income does not include changes in inventory values and is
simply gross cash income during the year minus cash operating
expenses.
   Economists said cash receipts from the sale of crops and
livestock are expected to rise $2 billion to $10 billion this year,
more than offsetting a decline in direct government payments to
farmers. Total expenses are likely to go up 3 percent to 6 percent,
largely because of more land being brought into crop production.
   ``Wheat and corn receipts are expected to rise as much as 15
percent this year, following sizeable gains last year'' the report
said. ``Vegetable receipts are also expected to rise. Soybeans,
however, probably will see falling receipts as higher domestic
production and record foreign output lead to a 25 percent decrease
in prices.''
   Total livestock and poultry receipts should see a modest rise,
but hogs could be the only livestock group facing a drop, the report
said. Although the decline in 1989 hog receipts is expected to be
small _ less than $500 million _ it will be on top of a $1 billion
reduction in 1988.

<TEXT>
   The government reportedly arrested 5,000
political workers Tuesday and asked others to stay in offices
overnight to prevent a nationwide strike to demand the resignation
of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Four major opposition parties set the general strike for
Wednesday in their latest attempt to focus attention on their
charges of government corruption.
   United News of India news agency said as many as 5,000 political
workers were arrested across the country Tuesday. There were no
details on any charges.
   The opposition has said that all businesses should be closed and
public transportation, except for essential services, should come to
a halt during the strike. The strike was intended as a show of
strength before parliamentry elections later this year.
   The government also asked thousands of its employees to stay in
their offices overnight so they could report for duty Wednesday.
   Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
government was paying to provide food and bedrolls for the
employees. They were allowed to bring children into offices, the
officials said.
   Senior government executives were given rooms in luxury hotels
near their offices, they said.
   No official announcement was made about how many employees were
involved. Government employees in New Delhi said thousands of people
were being asked to stay on.
   United News of India quoted an unidentified government spokesman
as saying officials absent from work Wednesday would lose a day's
salary.
   The government planned to provide full security to all Indians
who wish to work, he was quoted as saying. Trains, state-owned
buses, and air services would function normally, he reportedly said.
   The opposition has repeatedly accused the government of
corruption in past weeks.
   Last month, 106 opposition members in Parliament demanded that
Gandhi resign, saying a July government audit of an arms deal showed
that senior officials received kickbacks.
   When Gandhi refused, the opposition members resigned in a rare
display of solidarity.
   The opposition charge relates to a $1.4 billion deal for purchase
of artillery guns from AB Bofors of Sweden. Opposition politicians
say the Swedish company paid kickbacks amounting to $50 million to
government officials and members of Gandhi's Congress Party.
   No proof has been offered, and the government has denied
wrongdoing.
   The new elections must be held sometime before the end of the
year. In the last general elections in 1985, the Congress Party won
415 of 544 seats in Parliament.

   Investigators frustrated by a bold heist of
more than a ton of silver shaped like Hershey's kisses are hoping
the thieves brag and are also watching smelters capable of melting
down the $200,000-plus cache.
   ``We don't have any leads. But they have to melt it down, ''
Undersheriff Bill Davis said Tuesday. ``And I'm confident we'll get
a tip from somebody who'll hear about the heist. All good crooks
brag about the jobs they pulled.''
   Officials are investigating past and present employees of the
Trinity Silver Mine, where the robbery took place Saturday night.
The mine is about 20 miles from Lovelock, a town more than 90 miles
northeast of Reno.
   ``We're fairly sure it was an inside job,'' Davis said. ``They
knew something about the mine.''
   Gene Smith, spokesman for the U.S. Borax Corp., which owns part
of the mine, said a shotgun-toting man in a red ski mask tied up two
mine employees with duct tape and, with an accomplice who was either
a woman or a small man, used a wheelbarrow to haul 1.25 tons of
silver buttons to a pickup.
   They then left spikes in the road to flatten tires of any
pursuers.
   The robbery was discovered when the next shift came in Sunday
morning, police said. The bound employees weren't injured.
   It took the robbers more than one hour to haul the silver from a
locked vault to the pickup, said Smith. He said the thieves
apparently broke the lock.
   The buttons are made when silver removed from the mine's ore is
melted and poured into molds.
   Smith said the mine normally waits until it has about 50,000
ounces _ more than 1.5 tons _ of dore, or impure silver, before it
ships a load to a smelter for refining.
   The mine was expected to produce about $4 million worth of silver
this year.
   Pershing County authorities notified precious metals dealers. But
Smith and smelter operators said the crooks would probably melt the
silver themselves through an arrangement with a smelter or try to
ship it out of the country.
   ``They seem to have thought out everything else beforehand, so
I'm sure they've thought this through, too,'' Smith said.
   Bob Horton, associate dean of the Mackay School of Mines at the
University of Nevada-Reno, said authorities could trace the silver
by examining its makeup. Every precious metal sample has its own
unique mix of impurities.
   ``A normal refinery would wish to know the source of the silver
so if they're suspicious they would probably report it,'' Horton
added. However, he noted that crooks could add impurities to change
the silver's makeup.
   Horton said the crooks could easily ship the cache out of the
country because there are no controls on shipping gold and silver.
   ``The trading is pretty wide open,'' he said. ``That's why mining
companies pay a lot of attention to security.''
   Smelting companies contacted Tuesday all refused to comment on
the record about their operations.
   ``You don't like to talk about details of the operation because,
well, it's sort of like telling someone when the Brinks trucks are
going out,'' said a New York City official of one of the larger
precious-metal refining firms.

   A leader of the movement demanding the transfer of
the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan to
Armenia has been acquitted of corruption charges, a documentary
filmmaker said Tuesday.
   Arkady Manucharov, chairman of the Karabakh Committee, was jailed
last autumn along with other committee leaders blamed for organizing
mass demonstrations in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
   Filmmaker Arkady Ruderman, who is making a movie about
Nagorno-Karabakh, said Tuesday that a lower court had thrown out
corruption charges against Manucharov and the appeals court upheld
that decision Friday.
   Ruderman said Manucharov, a Yerevan glass factory manager, never
was accused of a crime connected to the protests.
   On Sunday, Manucharov was elected to a vacant seat in the
Armenian legislature with more than 90 percent of the vote, Ruderman
said. Authorities earlier refused to recognize his candidacy because
he was in jail.
   Ruderman said Manucharov apparently has not yet been released
from Moscow's Butirsky Prison.
   Meanwhile, Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin reported that
someone made ``an unconstitutional attempt to take power'' in
Nagorno-Karabakh last week, Tass said Tuesday.
   It quoted Bakatin as saying a person was killed, but did not say
when the incident occurred or give other details.
   The territory is in predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan. But it is
claimed by Armenia which, like Nagorno-Karabakh, is overwhelmingly
Christian.
   There have been frequent reports of violence in the area this
summer, some involving gunfire and explosives.

<HEAD>`Courier From Warsaw' Back after 45 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old courier returned home to Poland on
Tuesday after nearly 45 years, and he carried with him the message
of hope.
   ``This is the culminating moment of my whole life,'' said Jan
Nowak, the ``Courier from Warsaw,'' who is remembered for risking
his life repeatedly in acting as a go-between for the Polish
underground Home Army and the London government-in-exile during the
Nazi occupation of World War II.
   ``Two months ago I thought (this moment) would never come,'' said
Nowak, 76. ``I am so old I thought it would never come.''
   As he stepped foot back in Warsaw, he flashed the Solidarity
``V-for-victory'' sign. He was greeted with cheers, kisses, flowers
and a song of welcome.
   Nowak escaped Poland in October 1944 after the doomed 1944 Warsaw
Uprising and, mindful of the persecution of ex-Home Army officers
after the war's end, remained abroad for the decades that followed.
   Aside from his World War II exploits, Nowak, who lives outside
Washington, earned the anger of the postwar communist government
because he headed the Polish section of U.S.-government-financed
Radio Free Europe for 24 years, beaming in uncensored information in
Polish.
   In that role, he frequently was attacked in the official press
and by longtime government spokesman Jerzy Urban.
   Poland stopped jamming Radio Free Europe broadcasts on Jan. 1,
1988, and Nowak is able to return thanks to an improved political
climate _ marked by the restoration of Solidarity's legal status in
April and the election of Solidarity parliament representatives and
a Solidarity prime minister since June.
   Waiting to greet him Tuesday was a high-level delegation from the
Solidarity movement, led by the group's parliamentary leader
Bronislaw Geremek, veteran activist Jacek Kuron and Sens. Zofia
Kuratowska and Andrzej Celinski.
   Asked what Nowak's return meant for Poland, Celinski replied:
``Everything.''
   A group of about 50 Poles was on hand to welcome Nowak, including
a few veterans of the Home Army, which was persecuted by the
communists after the war but has been gradually rehabilitated in
recent years.
   ``We Poles look at the world through the prism of the war,
because it was then that the character of a man was shaped,'' said
Jozef Rodak of Warsaw, who remembered meeting Nowak after the 1944
Warsaw Uprising and still regards him as a hero.
   ``When he was fighting, leaving Poland meant a 99 percent chance
of death,'' said Rodak. ``But he took the risk. It is a great thing
for us. We value his courage and his sacrifices for the homeland.''
   As Nowak emerged from the VIP lounge at Warsaw's Okecie
International Airport, the crowd serenaded him with a round of ``Sto
Lat,'' or ``May He Live 100 Years.''
   ``Long live Solidarity,'' replied the beaming Nowak.
   Nowak, now a member of the national leadership of the
Polish-American Congress, gained additional fame in Poland in the
mid-1980s when his book, ``Courier from Warsaw,'' was issued in
Polish by the opposition's clandestine Nowa publishing house. It
became an underground best-seller.
   Several of the bystanders gave him flowers, kissed him and asked
him to autograph copies of the book.
   Invited as a guest of Lech Walesa and the Solidarity
parliamentary caucus, Nowak will participate in a series of
Solidarity and church observances of the 50th anniversary of the
outbreak of World War II this Thursday and Friday.

   Mickey Leland's widow announced Tuesday she will
not run for his U.S. House seat this fall.
   In a statement, Alison Leland, a 30-year-old investment banker,
cited her family responsibilities in deciding against seeking the
seat held by her husband for 10{ years before his death in a plane
crash in Ethiopia on Aug. 7.
   Mrs. Leland said she would support City Councilman Rodney Ellis
if he decides to run in the Nov. 7 special election.
   ``Mickey and I did discuss the future and the possibility that
someday he might pursue another career,'' she said. ``It is clear to
me that Mickey would have wanted to be succeeded by City Councilman
Rodney Ellis. He loved Rodney, he trusted Rodney, and considered him
to be among his closest friends.''
   Leland, a Democrat, and 15 others were killed when their plane
crashed while en route to an Ethiopian refugee camp on a hunger
relief mission.
   Ellis has said he would put off a decision about running until
Mrs. Leland announced her intentions.
   There was no immediate comment from Ellis; he did not return
calls to his office Tuesday.
   Since Leland's memorial service, state Sen. Craig Washington and
state Rep. Al Edwards have announced they will run. Several others
are considered possible candidates.
   Mrs. Leland, who has a 3-year-old son and is pregnant, said her
family responsibilities are too important to consider running for
Congress.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporations' after-tax profits fell 5.4
percent in the April-June quarter, the biggest decline in three
years, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
   The decline followed a smaller 1.1 percent drop in the first
three months of the year and left after-tax profits at an annual
rate of $164.3 billion in the second quarter.
   Analysts attributed the drop, the biggest since a 16.5 percent
decline in the first quarter of 1986, to rising business costs.
   U.S. busineses have enjoyed substantial profit gains over the
past two years, reflecting a major cost-cutting effort and a boom in
export sales.
   But many economists predicted that this period is drawing to a
close and profit increases this year will be much more modest.
   ``We could not keep the boom in corporate profits going
forever,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The
second quarter represents a slowing of that extraordinary momentum,
primarily because of cost increases for energy and raw materials.''
   The decline in profits for the second quarter was lead by a drop
in earnings for auto companies, the report said. Profits for
transportation companies and public utilities, however, rose during
the second quarter.
   Among the details in the profits report:
   _Before-tax profits dropped a sharp 6.4 percent in the second
quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $297.6 billion,
after falling a slight 0.3 percent in the first quarter.
   _Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and
inventories, fell 2.3 percent in the second quarter, to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $309.1 billion, after posting an even bigger
7 percent decline in the first quarter.
   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, rose 1.6 percent in the second
quarter, to an annual rate of $394.7 billion, after falling 5.6
percent in the first quarter.
   Dividend payments to stockholders increased 2 percent to an
annual rate of $120.9 billion after a 2.9 percent increase in the
first quarter.

   A Soviet labor camp inmate who met recently
with two visiting U.S. congressmen is being moved to another
facility where conditions are worse, an advocacy group for Soviet
Jews said Tuesday.
   The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews said it believes Mikhail
Petrovich Kazachkov is being punished for his outspokenness with the
American visitors.
   Kazachkov was tried on Aug. 25 in Perm Camp 35 on charges of
``refusal to work'' and sentenced to be transferred to the Chistopol
prison, the union said.
   Kazachkov, a physicist who heads a human rights monitoring group
at the camp, went on strike with eight other inmates to demand safer
work conditions, the union said.
   Sergei Kovalev, a former political prisoner, told the
Washington-based group in a telephone call from Moscow that the food
and conditions at Chistopol are worse than at Perm 35, ``and there
is less opportunity for fresh air.''
   Kazachkov, 45, was arrested in 1975, one week after applying to
emigrate. He was convicted of treason and other offenses and
sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp. In 1981 he was given an
additional 3{ years after protesting prison conditions.
   In 1987, the authorities offered to free Kazachkov if he
confessed to his alleged crimes on television, but he refused, the
union said. He suffered a heart attack the same year.
   Last December, he was visited by New York Times columnist A.M.
Rosenthal, and last month he was allowed a visit by Rep. Christopher
Smith, R-N.J., and Frank Wolf, R-Va.
   In an interview, Wolf said Soviet authorities had promised him
there would not be any reprisals of the kind carried out against
some prisoners after Rosenthal's visit. Wolf said he had spoken with
23 of the 38 inmates at Perm 35, which is situated in the foothills
of the Ural Mountains.
   ``There's no doubt Kazachkov is a prisoner of conscience. He
ought to be released from prison,'' Wolf said. ``This is an
opportunity for the Soviets to review his and other cases and to
show that glasnost is coming to the prison system too.''

<HEAD>Man Who May Have Clues on Missing Industrialist to Split His Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who may have the only clues to the
1980 disappearance of an industrialist is about to inherit nearly
half the businessman's $1.3 million estate.
   Donald Baggett, who was with industrialist Joseph F. Derr, then
73, on vacation in Mexico when Derr disappeared, has refused to talk
to police, and investigators have turned up no information on Derr's
whereabouts.
   Most of Derr's estate will be divided, according to his will,
between Baggett, 56, and a Pennsylvania school district once Probate
Judge Robert H. Lensing signs an order disbursing the money.
Lensing's action is considered a formality.
   Derr made his fortune in decorative plastics for appliances,
automobiles and business machines. His will, written in 1976, became
public in 1987 after the state asked that Derr be declared legally
dead.
   The court case dragged on while the state and other parties
challenged Lensing's decision to offer a $500,000 reward and spend
$100,000 from the estate on a renewed investigation into Derr's
disappearance. A state appeals court overturned Lensing's decision
last month.
   Derr went to Acapulco in December 1979 for his annual four-month
vacation, and Baggett soon joined him, court records show. Both men
were reported missing in January 1980.
   Baggett showed up the next month with a lawyer at the Evansville
Police Department. He refused to answer questions.
   Lensing ordered Baggett to appear at a hearing, but he refused to
answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   Baggett and the school district in Benton, Pa., where Derr grew
up, each will receive $441,797. Baggett also will get the $129,000
Evansville duplex he shared with Derr.

   Israeli soldiers Tuesday demolished or sealed
seven houses belonging to Palestinian families whose sons are
accused of bombings or attacking suspected collaborators with
Israeli authorities.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers opened fire during a
stone-throwing protest killing a 27-year-old student, the army said.
In the West Bank, an Arab man suspected of collaborating with
Israeli authorities died of wounds.
   The deaths raised to 554 the number of Palestinians killed by
soldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising and to 100 the
toll of Palestinians slain by fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators
with Israel. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died.
   Also Tuesday, Palestinian uprising leaflets appeared for the
first time signed by a group calling itself Hezbollah. A government
source said officials think the group, like the radical Hezbollah in
Lebanon, is tied to Iran.
   ``Hezbollah and the revolutionary court of justice are going to
lay in wait for the Zionists and take revenge for every drop of
blood spilled by their hands,'' said the leaflets.
   The government source said many leaflets were distributed in Arab
east Jerusalem and nearby Bethlehem, but Palestinians said only a
few have appeared.
   Army officials think the group was formed by fundamentalist
Moslem Palestinians deported from Israel who made their way to
Tehran, the source said.
   The student killed in Gaza ws identified as Ismail Abu Jayyab. He
had been jailed four times in the 20-month-old uprising against
Israeli rule of the occupied territories and was described by Arab
reporters as head of Shabiba, the youth movement of Yasser Arafat's
PLO faction Fatah, at Gaza's Islamic University.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed soldiers killed Jayyab.
   Hospital officials in Ramallah confirmed the death of Hussein
Hila Brahama, 40, from a skull fracture he sustained last week. The
army radio said he was injured when youths in the town of Jericho
firebombed his house.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   Hospital officials said at least 16 Palestinians were shot and
wounded in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths
Tuesday in the Gaza Strip.
   A 29-year-old teacher also was reported shot in the West Bank
when soldiers fired at youths who fled into a schoolyard in Nablus.
   In Israel, a Jewish youth was stabbed by an 18-year-old Arab in
Rishon Lezion town near Tel Aviv in what a police spokesman said
appeared a politically motivated act. The victim was slightly
injured.
   Soldiers in the West Bank destroyed two houses in Beit Sahur and
Askar villages and sealed five other homes in Askar and Tulkarem
town, army spokesmen said.
   Those who lived in the houses are accused of setting fire to an
army truck, planting a roadside bomb and attacking suspected Arab
collaborators, the army said. One suspect is accused of killing an
alleged collaborator.
   Arab reporters said the houses belonged to families whose sons,
aged 15 to 26, are suspected of anti-Israeli violence. They said
most of the sons are in jail and one was convicted of a firebombing
and sentenced to two years imprisonment.
   Forty-two people lived in the homes destroyed and sealed, Arab
reports said.
   The army has demolished more than 200 houses and sealed over 100
during the uprising in a collective punshiment the United States and
human rights groups condemn as a violation of due process since most
suspects never are tried.
   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, the military issued an order
requiring special permits for Palestinians to own facsimile machines
following reports that they are used to distribute anti-Israeli
leaflets.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz called on the government to reverse the
order, saying it will be viewed abroad as interference in civilian
life and could harm Israel's image.
   ``Outlawing the popular, civilian communications machine will
obviously serve as a juicy news item throughout the world,'' Haaretz
said.

<HEAD>Security Council Criticizes South Africa's Namibia Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council unanimously adopted a
resolution Tuesday criticizing South Africa for failing to fully
cooperate with U.N. monitors overseeing the world body's
independence plan for Namibia.
   South Africa insists it is complying with the one-year U.N. plan
to end its 74-year rule of Namibia.
   The resolution demands the complete disbandment of a notorious
paramilitary police unit called Koevoet and demands all parties
comply strictly with the U.N. plan, ``especially South Africa.''
   British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell said he had ``considerable
doubts about the evenhandedness'' of a resolution singling out South
Africa, but voted in favor to preserve unanimity.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said he voted for the
resolution because it was a ``compromise among several strongly held
positions about Namibia.''
   The reprimand was watered down during days of bargaining between
African and Western council members.
   The original draft attacked South Africa for ``not complying''
with the U.N. plan, but Britain and the United States succeeded in
weakening that language.
   The resolution calls for complete impartiality by the Namibian
broadcast media during the current election campaign and asks
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to see South Africa
conducts a free and fair election.
   Tuesday's vote follows two weeks of speeches by about 40 nations
complaining South Africa is trying to rig the November election
against the South-West African People's Organization, the
guerrilla-backed movement favored to form an independent government.
   In Washington, a group of prominent American jurists, former
Cabinet members and legislators who have just returned from Namibia
echoed the criticism.
   The group, called the Commission of Independence for Namibia,
accused South Africa of trying ``to do everything they can to
manipulate the process,'' in the words of Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-MI,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Africa.
   His group also called for Koevoet to be purged.
   The resolution adopted by the 15 Security Council members does
not refer to the guerrilla organization, also called SWAPO, which
fought a 23-year bush war against South African rule.
   ``I think this clarifies what we've suspected all along, that
this was an attempt to whitewash SWAPO and carry on what has been an
unnecessarily protracted exercise for reasons that we find difficult
to explain,'' said South African U.N. Ambassador Jeremy B. Shearar.
   The Security Council debate appeared to win some response from
the protagonists.
   On Aug. 15, the day before debate opened, South Africa's
administrator-general in Namibia, Louis Pienaar, announced all 1,200
Koevoet officers in the South-West African Police would be withdrawn
from northern Namibia and confined to base.
   U.N. officials say Koevoet members have terrorized guerrilla
supporters in northern Namibia.
   During the debate, Shearar asked why the council was not
investigating allegations the guerrrilla movement still is detaining
hundreds of political prisoners.
   Following his speech, the guerrilla organization announced that
for the first time it would let the Red Cross and other
international inspectors visit its camps.
   In April, SWAPO released about 200 detainees held on suspicion of
spying, but those freed say they were tortured and that at least
1,000 more prisoners are held in camps in Angola and Zambia.

   Soaking rain continued faling over the central United States on
Tuesday, and wet weather was scattered over the northwestern and
southeastern corners of the nation.
   Showers and thunderstorms dumped rain on parts of Kansas and
Missouri during the morning.
   Last year at this time, parts of northern Missouri were begging
for rain as annual rainfall amounts were off by nearly 10 inches.
   But over the weekend and up to Tuesday, Maryville, Mo., had
recorded 8.20 inches of rain. Other amounts included 5.74 inches at
Amity, Mo.; 3.93 at Unionville, Mo., and 3.46 at Kansas City, Mo.
   Parts of south-central and southeastern Kansas got locally heavy
rain during the morning. Wichita received an additional 0.92 of an
inch of rain, bringing their total rainfall to 3.09 inches in 24
hours. The Whitewater River at Augusta was slightly under a foot
from flood stage during the afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms with locally heavy rain and gusty wind
also fell from southwestern Indiana to central Arkansas.
   In the Southeast, isolated showers and thunderstorms occurred
along parts of the western and central Gulf Coast, with locally
heavy rain reported over the Florida Panhandle during the morning.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.05 inches in Mary Esther, Fla.
   In the Northwest, showers and thunderstorms developed over
sections of western Oregon.
   Albuquerque, N.M., cooled to a record low of 54 degrees Tuesday
morning.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees in Thief River Falls, Minn., to 106 in Phoenix. Tuesday
morning's low in the Lower 48 states was 28 degrees in Gunnison,
Colo., and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the middle and lower Mississippi Valley to the Gulf Coast
states and the middle and southern Atlantic Coast. Showers were
forecast along the New England coast, and from parts of the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies and the northern Plains.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted from the Pacific Coast through
the Pacific Northwest and inland, and from the upper Mississippi
Valley to the Great Lakes and New England; between 100 and 110
degrees in the desert Southwest; and in the 80s or 90s across much
of the rest of the nation.

   Amtrak is on a fast track to criminal court
after refusing to stop flushing toilet waste from trains.
   State Attorney John Tanner, who filed littering charges against
the passenger railroad, had offered to drop the three misdemeanor
counts if Amtrak agreed to stop dumping from trains passing over two
overwater trestles.
   But Amtrak, whichhas been dumping along its right of way under a
federal law that railroads have been using for more than a century,
contends federal law overrides state and local law. Clifford Black,
an Amtrak spokesman at its Washington headquarters, said Florida
risks losing service if it presses the case.
   An arraignment was scheduled Sept. 18. The charges carry fines of
up to $5,000 each.
   Amtrak's 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at
least 35 mph.
   Tanner tried to halt the practice only over the two trestles.
   Black said agreeing to Tanner's conditions would make Amtrak a
target for similar demands over every body of water in Florida.
``With the myriad waterways in Florida, it would be an impossible
situation,'' he said Monday.
   The railroad hopes to replace much of its fleet with new cars
equipped with holding tanks for all toilets. Black said it would
cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet.
   Amtrak fears having to hire a worker to stand in each car to
throw an override switch for toilets when the trains cross bodies of
water, Black said.
   Tanner said Amtrak is bluffing and could not afford to cut back
service in Florida or the Western states _ Oregon, Washington, Utah,
California and Nevada _ where it has also come under fire for its
sanitary habits.
   Black said that the criminal case is the only one of its kind
against Amtrak of which he is aware. Two civil cases are pending in
Oregon, he said.

<HEAD>Government Junta to Take Over Friday; Opposition Members Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said
Tuesday a provisional government will take over on sept 1,
inauguration day under the constitution, and the opposition said it
would be dictatorship ``behind a new facade.''
   Also Tuesday, the Defense Forces said five opposition party
members were arrested near the Costa Rican border on charges of
threatening national security.
   No official announcement has been made of the government's form
or makeup, but most observers expect it to be a junta approved by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the military and police commander who
wields the real power in Panama.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma said Tuesday ``all possible
formulas of government'' were being evaluated and ``we will do the
best for the country.'' he said.
   Ritter said it would be a ``provisional government with the
widest possible political support.''
   The opposition, which international observers say won a 3-1
victory in the May 7 election, said it would not be involved in the
new regime. The government Noriega sponsors annulled the election on
grounds of U.S. ``interference.''
   The opposition was invited to join a junta but refused, saying it
would continue its campaign to oust Noriega as head of the Defense
Forces.
   ``We refused the offer for a share of bureaucratic spoils,'' said
Ricardo Arias Calderon, opposition vice presidential candidate and
leader of the Christian Democratic Party.
   He said the new government will be ``a continuation of the
military dictatorship'' and the opposition expects ``repression and
the crisis to continue and the dictatorship to go on behind a new
facade.''
   U.S. officials have said the United States will not recognize the
new government.
   ``There can be no accomodation with a government in which Noriega
is the real power,'' said a U.S. source who requested anonymity.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on charges of drug
trafficking and laundering money. Washington applied economic
sanctions in an attempt to force him from power.
   The general calls the campaign against him a disguised attempt to
renege on the 1977 treaties that turn the Panama Canal over to
Panama at the end of the century.
   Solis Palma said Tuesday: ``The permanence of Gen. Noriega at the
head of the Defense Forces is part of the struggle for national
liberation. We cannot accept an improvement of relations with the
United States based on the acceptance of the removal of an official
of the Panamanian government under pressure.''
   Meanwhile, a communique read over National Radio said the five
opposition members arrested planned to destroy bridges and provoke
violence and had undergone guerrilla training on the Costa Rican
side of the border.
   It said the suspects were members of the Christian Democratic
Party but gave no other details. There was no immediate comment from
the party.
   Defense Forces sources in the Chiriqui Province near the border
who asked not to be named said the arrests had taken place over the
past few days.
   Three weeks ago, the Costa Rican government denied reports in the
Panamanian press that rebels were training in Villa Neilly near the
border.

<HEAD>Appeals Court OKs Random Drug Tests for Some Army Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the
Army may subject more than 6,500 of its civilian workers to random
drug tests, including law enforcement and aviation personnel.
   The Army in 1986 implemented drug testing for more than 9,000 of
its 450,000 civilian employees.
   In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals said 3,700 civilian
police and guards should face mandatory drug tests because of the
threat to public safety posed by ``drug-impaired, gun-toting
civilian officers.''
   The 2,800 civilians who fly and service the Army's airplanes and
helicopters also should undergo random drug testing due to the
possibly ``calamitous consequences'' of a single drug-related lapse,
the appeals court said.
   A small group of civilian laboratory workers don't have to
undergo mandatory, random testing, said the decision by appeals
court judge David Sentelle.
   The appeals court said it was unable to determine whether random
tests should be imposed on a group of employees that includes some
secretaries and engineering technicians. The appeals court returned
that portion of the case to U.S. District Court for further
consideration.
   Employee unions, including the American Federation of Government
Employees, launched a court challenge to the legality of the random
portions of the Army's civilian testing program.
   The government argued that compulsory testing was justified by
compelling governmental interests in maintaining the safety,
security and integrity of its workforce.
   A lower court permanently enjoined the testing in 1988,
concluding that mandatory, random testing constituted an
unreasonable search. The permanent injunction was delayed pending
outcome of the appeal.
   The Supreme Court, in its first ruling on testing for drug and
alcohol abuse in the American workplace, last March said workers in
sensitive government jobs or those entrusted with public safety may
be forced to undergo the tests.

<HEAD>West Trying to Subvert Socialism, Says Vietnam's Party Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general secretary of Vietnam's
Communist Party accused President Bush and other Western leaders of
trying to take advantage of reforms in some countries to undermine
socialism, according to a report available Tuesday.
   Nguyen Van Linh told the 7th plenum of the party's Central
Committee that reforms in some socialist lands were causing ``newly
arising difficulties.''
   ``We express our profound concern over the danger threatening .
.. socialism in some fraternal socialist countries.''
   He said that Western politicians, including Bush, left ``no stone
unturned in an attempt to affect the situation in a number of
socialist countries with the aim of driving these into the free
world of capitalism.''
   The plenum was held in Hanoi from Aug. 15-24. A text of Linh's
speech at the closing session was broadcast Monday on Radio Hanoi
and was seen in Bangkok on Tuesday.
   ``In a number of socialist countries currently facing many
difficulties, the imperialists and reactionary forces are colluding
... to undermine the gains of the socialist revolution,'' Linh said.
   He said Vietnam is also affected by this international situation.
   Over the past few days, official Vietnamese news reports have
denounced ``counterrevolutionaries'' in Poland, where the first
non-Communist prime minister for 46 years was appointed last week.
   Linh's speech seemed to indicate a predominately conservative
streak in Vietnamese politics, despite some liberal reforms. Hanoi
is closed aligned with Moscow, where President Mikhail Gorbachev is
making major economic and social reforms.
   However, the 7th plenum rejected ``bourgeois liberalization,
pluralism, political plurality and multi-opposition parties aimed at
denying Marxism-Leninism, socialism and the party's leadership,''
Linh said.
   He said ``serious shortcomings'' in the Vietnamese party's own
ideological work had ``caused certain persons to mistakenly believe
that the nature of imperialism had changed.''
   Linh accused some party members of ``irresponsible, disorganized
and undisciplined acts'' and of inciting ``a number of people to
disturb public order and security and engage in factional
activities.''
   In his criticism of the United States, Linh said Washington has
continued its space defense program and tightened its ``military
belts'' around socialist countries.
   He charged that it had established arms caches in Thailand and
was ``scheming'' to set up military bases in Singapore.
   ``All these acts are part of their menace strategy relying on
military strength to oppose the Soviet Union (and) socialist
countries,'' he said.
   ``We do not nurture the illusion that the imperialists ... are
willing to achieve peaceful coexistance with us,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group said Tuesday new laws
are needed to prevent chemical companies from manufacturing highly
toxic pesticides banned in this country and sending them abroad.
   The practice ``has created a circle of poison'' where in some
cases food tainted by the toxic chemicals is imported into the
United States and sold to consumers, said Sandra Marquardt, who has
followed the issue for the environmental group Greenpeace.
   Greenpeace cited the practices of the Velsicol Chemical Corp.,
which from its plant in Memphis, Tenn., is the world's only producer
of the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor. Both pesticides have
been banned for agricultural use in the United States since 1978 and
for virtually all other uses in recent years because they were found
to cause cancer.
   The two pesticides, which had been widely used for treatment of
termites, have been banned or severely restricted for use in 48
countries because of their carcinogenic properties.
   Nevertheless, said Ms. Marquardt, Velsicol exported nearly 5
million pounds of the two pesticides to 25 countries between 1987
and the middle of this year. More than 330,000 pounds went to
Argentina and another 510,000 pounds to Australia, countries that
import meat and other products into the United States.
   In a statement issued from the chemical company's headquarters in
Rosemont, Ill., Velsicol called the Greenpeace report on its
continued sale of the two pesticides abroad as ``grossly
inaccurate'' and said it remained committed to producing the
products and shipping them abroad.
   ``Forty years of product use and research conducted by scientists
who are experts in their field support the continued use of
chlordane and heptachlor,'' said Charles H. Frommer, the company's
vice president of government, regulatory and public affairs.
   He suggested in some cases there are no practical substitutes for
the chemicals, a contention disputed by Greenpeace.
   Dr. Samuel Epstein, a professor of occupational and environmental
medicine at the University of Illinois Medical Center, who
participated in a Greenpeace news conference in Washington, accused
Velsicol of failing to inform their foreign customers of the danger
posed by the two pesticides.
   He accused the company of ``manipulation of information'' about
the two chemicals and that warning labels often are not explicit and
people handling the pesticides not aware of precautions that should
be taken.
   ``If these products are too toxic to be used here (in the United
States), they are too toxic to be used anywhere,'' said Ms.
Marquardt.
   She maintained that the Food and Drug Administration and the
Agriculture Department are too shorthanded to adequately monitor
food imports for content of pesticides that have been banned in this
country.
   She said last year two shipments of beef from Honduras were found
to have been contaminated with the Velsicol pesticides. She said
heptachlor contamination also has been found in imported carrots,
pineapples, garbanzo beans and cheese, although the source of the
contamination was not clear.

   Japan told international negotiators ending their
latest talks Tuesday they may be letting chances fade for adopting a
global ban on chemical weapons.
   Chusei Yamada, Tokyo's chief envoy to the 40-nation Conference on
Disarmament, suggested the conference agree on a target date for
adopting a draft treaty.
   As the chemical weapons talks ended the 10-week session, Yamada
said progress was made this year mainly on technical issues. He said
the ``important political issues,'' such as provisions for
monitoring compliance, were unresolved.
   Yamada said a 149-nation conference on chemicals arms held in
Paris in January gave political impetus to the Geneva talks, but he
expressed ``a sense of uneasiness that the momentum might be
slipping out of our fingers.''
   The talks were entering a three-month recess.
   The United States has told Western allies it will not accept an
``artificial deadline'' at the conference, which has been debating a
global convention banning production, stockpiling and use of
chemical arms since 1968.
   French envoy Pierre Morel, who presides over the conference's
chemical arms negotiating committee, said the draft treaty was
``sharply improved'' this year.
   He said new provisions were added on protecting the
confidentiality of private chemical plants and progress was made in
working out an international inspection mechanism and classification
of toxic chemicals to be banned.
   Conference negotiators expect their next session to begin
incorporating U.S.-Soviet proposals on the destruction of stockpiles
and inspection procedures into the draft accord, Morel said.
   Talks on the treaty are to resume Nov. 28. The full conference is
expected to reconvene early next year.

<HEAD>Primate's Comments on Jews Stir New Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World clamor set off by Cardinal John
Glemp's remarks grew louder Tuesday. One charge hurled at the head
of Poland's Roman Catholic Church was that he used Nazi-like
arguments against Jews.
   Glemp's Saturday comments were meant to calm international
criticism about his church's attitude toward Jews. Instead, his
speech set off a new round of controversy about alleged
anti-Semitism in the church.
   Glemp told pilgrims at Jasna Gora Monastery at Czestochowa,
Poland, that Polish anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews abandon
``anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments.
   He asked Jews to understand that it offended Poles' religious
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty for Jews to insist on
removal of a Carmelite convent set up on the edge of the former Nazi
German death camp at Auschwitz in Poland.
   ``Dear Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are
impossible to meet,'' Glemp said.
   But some of his language _ invoking the image of Jews spreading
communism, mentioning that some Jews collaborated with Nazis during
World War II, that Jews as businessmen neglected or detested Poles,
and saying that Jews have easy access to mass media _ apparently
added fuel to charges of anti-Semitism.
   ``The expressions used by the primate, even contrary to his
intentions, pose a danger of deeply wounding the feelings of many of
those who are descendants and brothers of the Holocaust victims,''
said Catholic journalist Krzysztof Sliwinski in a rare published
criticism of Glemp.
   The commentary appeared Monday in the opposition's Gazeta
Wyborcza newspaper.
   Elsewhere the response was even more biting.
   Referring to Glemp's comment about easy Jewish access to mass
media, the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism
said in Paris it regretted that Glemp ``made use of arguments used
against Jews by the Nazis yesterday and by the extreme right in
France today.''
   Yossi Sarid, a legislator from the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement in Israel, said Tuesday in Jerusalem, ``Anti-Semitism has a
long history in Poland and I think it is ridiculous to talk about
`anti-Polonism.'
   Rome's Chief Rabbi Elio Toaff said in a newspaper interview the
question of anti-Semitism is something the church ``has to face.
...The analysis has to be deep enough to eradicate once and for all
the anti-Semitism that still exists in many countries, like Poland.''
   ``It is particularly serious that it was Glemp, one noted for
diplomacy and political gifts, who confused cause and effects,''
said Tullia Zevi, head of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities,
quoted in the same article Monday in Rome's I Messaggero.
   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France
issued a statement Monday calling Glemp's comments ``malicious and
out of place.''
   They ``bring us back to a period we believed was forgotten: that
of 50 years ago, before the war, when comments of this type were
made and led to the tragedy that we know about.''
   Relations between the Polish church and Jewish organizations were
already strained by church refusal to relocate the community of
Carmelite nuns from Auschwitz. The convent site has been criticized
as offensive because most of the camp's victims were executed simply
for being Jews.
   An estimated 2.5 million of the 4 million victims of
Auschwitz-Birkenau were Jewish.
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, whose diocese includes
the camp, announced Aug. 10 that the church was suspending a 1987
agreement to move the convent. He said it could not fulfill the
agreement in an atmosphere of ``aggressive demands.''
   The proposal to remove the convent, which was founded in 1984
just outside the Auschwitz fence, has found little sympathy in
Poland. Poles have commonly argued that thousands of the victims at
Auschwitz were Polish political prisoners, including many priests
and nuns.
   Cardinal Albert DeCourtray, archbishop of Lyon in France, said
Tuesday it was unlikely that Glemp's words were meant the way they
were received.
   He said the ``primate and bishops of Poland cannot be accused of
an anti-Semitism, which they denounce.''
   The issue of anti-Semitism remains much discussed in Poland even
though only several thousand Jews remain compared to a prewar Jewish
population of 3.5 million.
   Poles often feel wrongly accused of blanket anti-Semitism or of
playing an active role in the Holocaust, carried out by Nazi German
occupiers of Poland.
   Few Poles deny that anti-Semitism exists here, but they often
argue that it is exaggerated and note that many Poles risked their
own lives to protect Jews during the war.

   The grass-roots independence movement in
the Soviet republic of Lithuania has congratulated Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki on becoming the East bloc's first non-communist
leader, PAP reported Tuesday.
   ``Your victory is also our victory,'' the state news agency
quoted a telegram sent by the Lithuanian Movement for
Reconstruction, Sajudis, as saying.
   ``We have no doubt that the experience of heroic struggle of
Solidarity makes the strivings for freedom and independence by your
closest neighbors understandable to you.''
   Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity journalist, was elected prime
minister by the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament, on Thursday.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev recently complained that
Lithuanian activists are pressing too hard for independence from the
Soviet Union, Sajudis members have reported.
   The histories of neighboring Lithuania and Poland long have been
intertwined. The countries were linked from 1386 to 1795, first
through a family dynasty and later as a joint commonwealth.
   The Lithuanian capital of Vilnius was captured by Poland in 1920
and held until 1939. Today, Lithuania retains a significant Polish
minority, and Poland has a small Lithuanian minority.

<HEAD>Britain Publishing Inquiry Into Austrian President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said Tuesday it will publish in full the
findings of its inquiry into whether Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim is linked to the Nazi executions of six British commandos
in World War II.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the report ordered by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
February 1988 will be published within a few weeks, but no date was
fixed.
   He would not elaborate, and made no comment on a British
newspaper report Tuesday that the findings are likely to be
inconclusive.
   The Daily Telegraph, quoting defense sources, said the report
would shed ``fresh light'' on the war record of Waldheim, a former
U.N. secretary-general who was an intelligence officer in the German
army. But it added ``no major revelations are likely.''
   Speculation has arisen that some evidence may be suppressed
because of possible postwar links between Waldheim and British and
U.S. intelligence services.
   The six commandos were in a raiding party captured in the
German-occupied Balkans in April 1944. They were handed over for
interrogation to Waldheim's unit in Army Group E, refused to talk,
and were executed. It is a crime under the Geneva Convention to kill
prisoners of war.
   An international commission of historians that investigated
Waldheim's army career reported in February 1988 that the initial
``W'' was on transcripts of interrogations of the six men.
   The commission said it could not prove a connection between
Waldheim and the commandos, but suggested he knew they were shot by
the Gestapo under a general order by Adolf Hitler to execute
commandos.
   The Britons' fate was part of the commission's inquiry into
charges that Waldheim took part in or facilitated atrocities,
including massacres of 60,000 Yugoslav partisans and civilians and
rounding up Jews for death camps.
   The commission concluded Waldheim lied about his war record, knew
about atrocities and did nothing to stop them, but left open the
question of guilt.
   Waldheim says he did nothing wrong after being drafted into the
German army.
   For the British inquiry, the United States sent to London copies
of German army war records relating to the commandos' capture. The
original files were among documents captured by American forces as
the war ended in 1945.

   An Israeli reserve officer linked to fighter
training programs for hirelings of Colombian drug lords was warned
by Israeli government officials six months ago to stop his
activities, Israel radio said Tuesday.
   It said the officer, Lt. Col. Yair Klein, fled Colombia but four
Israeli associates ended up ``as hostages'' in his paramilitary
training camp until a deal for their release was worked out.
   Klein's lawyer, Yigal Shapira, denied the kidnapping report.
   ``There is absolutely no truth to it,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It's a nice story though.''
   Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber would not answer telephone
calls asking for comment.
   The radio, which attributed its report to unidentified security
sources, said Klein earned about $800,000 for his work, including
providing arms and equipment to the men he was training.
   The government has begun investigating Klein's activities. The
radio report indicated the government has been aware for months of
Klein's operations.
   Police investigators questioned two more reserve officers in the
case Tuesday and said others with possible links to Colombian
training would be called. Interrogated were Avraham Tsadaka and
Mariot Shoshani.
   Israeli newspapers said Tuesday that Israel was concerned that
reports of such involvement by Israeli mercenaries could hurt the
country's lucrative arms trade.
   The Miami Herald and also the Washington Post, quoting a
confidential report by Colombian security forces, reported that at
least five Israeli and 11 British mercenaries helped train teams of
assassins for Colombian cocaine traffickers and their right-wing
allies.
   Shapira repeated on Tuesday that neither Klein nor his firm, Hod
Hahanit (Spearhead), sold weapons in Colombia. He would not comment
on reports Klein was warned to leave that South American nation by
Israeli officials.
   The Yediot Ahronot daily, in a report from Bogota, said Colombia
has purchased about $350 million worth of Galil rifles, Kfir fighter
jets and communications equipment from Israel.
   Police questioned Klein Monday on suspicion of violating Israeli
security laws with his possible involvement in training killers for
the Medellin cartel.
   Israel radio said that ``in the Defense Ministry, people knew.
They asked the head of security in the Bogota Embassy to meet Yair
Klein and stop his activities. They are illegal and to get out of
there and fast.''
   It said Klein went to Bogota about six months ago to start a
training course and was warned by an Israeli official not to do so
because the group being trained ``was in opposition to the
(Colombian) government.''
   Klein persisted, smuggling equipment and weapons to a camp about
60 miles south of Bogota after paying a $100,000 bribe, the report
said, but he fled after a second warning saying Colombian
authorities wanted to arrest him.
   After Klein left, apparently in April, Colombians at the training
camp reportedly held four of Klein's Israelis hostage, but freed
them after bribes were paid, the report said.

   Four new refugee camps will be built to
handle an expected increase in what already is a flood of East
Germans fleeing their strict communist homeland through Hungary,
officials said Tuesday.
   The Munich newspaper Abendzeitung said huge tent cities for
refugees were planned in Bavaria and thousands of East Germans
visiting Hungary would be allowed to go directly to the West.
   Anton Haussmann, spokesman for Bavaria's Social Ministry, said
four new camps with a total capacity of 5,000 people will be built
in the southern state as temporary homes for new East German
refugees. Two other camps already exist, in Hesse and North
Rhine-Westphalia states.
   Haussmann denied the Abendzeitung report that 15,000 East Germans
would arrive in West Germany from Hungary by the weekend.
   The newspaper sent telexes of its report to other news
organizations in advance of Wednesday's publication.
   Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff,
confirmed that West Germany was preparing for a greater influx of
East German refugees.
   ``It is the federal government's responsibility to make
preparations for all possible eventualities,'' he said during an
evening newscast on the ZDF television network.
   East Germans are given automatic citizenship by West Germany and
receive assistance in starting new lives.
   Hungary already has said it would not return East Germans against
their will. West German and Hungarian government officials have held
talks about the East German refugees.
   Discontented East Germans have left by the tens of thousands in
the past few months, by both legal and illegal means. At least
100,000 are expected to reach West Germany by the end of the year.
   More than 5,000 East Germans have escaped through Hungary since
the liberal communist regime began in May to dismantle the barbed
wire and other barriers along its border with Austria.
   Scores of East Germans have taken refuge in West German
diplomatic missions in East Berlin and Prague, the Czechoslovak
capital.
   The situation has caused tension between East and West Germany.
Bonn demands that East Germany undertake reforms that would remove
the reasons for large numbers of people to leave. East Germany
claims West Germany incited the exodus.
   Junge Welt, or Youth World, the East German Communist Party youth
paper, published a letter Tuesday that called the refugees traitors.
   Czechoslovakia's ambassador in Bonn, Dusan Spacil, said harboring
East Germans in West German diplomatic missions was a ``misuse'' of
the function of such facilities, the Badische Zeitung of Freiburg
reported.

   Merchants boarded up storefronts and swept
up broken glass Tuesday after a night of vandalism and looting
sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black man.
   Leaders of this city of 54,000 people about 40 miles southeast of
Philadelphia moved to prevent another night of violence.
   Samuel Clark, president of the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, met with Mayor
Harry Curley to try to defuse racial tensions that escalated into
rioting Monday night by nearly 200 people on the city's main street
and the arrest of 23 people.
   In New York City, religious and community leaders met with
reporters, and called for continued efforts to root out racism in
the wake of the fatal shooting of a black teen-ager by white youths
last week.
   In a separate statement, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo called on New
Yorkers to pray ``that we will make this moment of shame a time for
honesty and renewal.''
   Police said the gang in the borough of Brooklyn attacked four
black youths because they believed the four were going to visit a
young woman who had spurned one of the gang members. Yusef Hawkins,
16, was killed.
   The New Jersey violence followed Sunday's shooting of Samuel
Williams, 26.
   About 40 businesses and 20 cars were damaged by rocks and
bottles, most of them along a mile-long stretch, police said. Four
people were injured.
   Damage was estimated at $75,000 to $100,000 for broken windows,
and officials were still trying to gauge losses from looting, city
spokesman Lee Tofanelli said at an afternoon news conference.
   Eight of those arrested were charged with burglary, assault and
theft. police said. The remaining 15 were charged with disorderly
persons offenses. All were released.
   Tofanelli said city patrols were beefed up Tuesday night and
officers had orders to arrest any disorderly persons.
   Williams was shot after he apparently threatened officer Paul
Letizia with a steel rod, said Police Chief Joseph Cassisi.
Williams, who was wanted on drug and weapon charges, was spotted by
officers after police received an anonymous call about a man on a
bicycle carrying drugs, Cassisi said.
   After being told he was under arrest, Williams picked up the rod
and approached Letizia, swinging, Cassisi said. Letizia, who is
white, fired two shots at Williams, hitting him both times.
   Police found no drugs on Williams. The state attorney general's
office has taken over the investigation of the shooting.
   At the city's news conference, the victim's sister, Velma Doyle,
called for an end to the violence.
   ``I really would hope everyone would calm down and wait to see
what really happened,'' she said.
   Before Tuesday's meeting, Clark of the NAACP called for
Cassissi's resignation, saying he had mishandled the matter.
   He said that many in the community became angry over newspaper
reports in which the police chief called the shooting a
``justifiable homicide.''
   ``That was the catalyst,'' Clark said. ``That sparked the anger.''
   Cassisi, in a statement read Tuesday by city spokesman Tofanelli,
said, ``in the absence of a complete investigation, it appears to me
that proper police procedures were followed in the shooting
incident.''

   Good driving skills and a good aim
seem like reasonable police officer essentials, but nice-looking
clothes also count in Beverly Hills, where money talks and
celebrities sometimes squawk.
   ``This is a very image-conscious city,'' Lt. Robert Curtis said
Tuesday after the Beverly Hills Police Department learned its force
won a special achievement award in the national Best Dressed Police
Department Competition.
   ``We are expected not only to function well, but also to look
professional,'' Curtis said. Although officers wear the standard
navy blue uniform, Curtis said attention to detail gives them an
appearance edge.
   The examples are subtle. Rather than black plastic buttons,
Beverly Hills officers use brass; motorcycle officers have a yellow
pant leg stripe; and color guard, canine and special tactics units
have tailored uniforms.
   ``Little things make a difference,'' Curtis said.
   Officers who protect and serve on such well-known streets as
Rodeo Drive are often asked to pose for pictures with tourists.
   ``We're in the public eye a lot more,'' said Officer Sammy Lee,
who spends 35 minutes each morning polishing his motorcycle.

   The cranberry muffin, touted as a candidate

``meadow muffin'' _otherwise known as the cow pie.
   State Rep. Dale Schultz said Tuesday he is thinking about
proposing the ``meadow muffin'' as an alternative to a cranberry
muffin bill pending in the Legislature.
   A backer of the cranberry muffin, Sen. Lloyd Kincaid, didn't
think much of the idea.
   ``I think it's an insult to the children who are backing the
cranberry muffin,'' said Kincaid, whose bill is before a Senate
committee.
   Wisconsin ranks second behind Massachusetts in the production of
cranberries.

<TEXT>
   The troubled Fort St. Vrain nuclear
power plant, the nation's only helium-cooled reactor, was shut down
nearly a year earlier than planned because of cracks in steam tubes,
utility officials said Tuesday.
   The hairline cracks found Aug. 18 in tubes that supply steam to
drive the the plant's turbine generator pose no threat to the
public, but fixing them would have required a lengthy shutdown
anyway, officials said.
   The 330-megawatt reactor 35 miles north of Denver has repeatedly
experienced equipment problems and unplanned shutdowns since opening
in 1976. In December, Public Service Co. of Colorado said it planned
to end nuclear operations at the plant in June 1990.
   ``Although we had hoped the plant would perform through the first
half of 1990, our board and executive management feel this is the
most prudent action to take in light of the new difficulties at the
plant,'' said utility Chairman Delwin Hock.
   Utility officials, however, would not rule out resuming nuclear
operations at Fort St. Vrain, even though they had ruled it out in
December.
   Public Service spokeswoman Peggy Morton said the utility could
permanently close the plant, convert it to fossil fuel or resume
nuclear operations with financial help. The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has licensed the plant to run through 2008.
   However, Morton said plant workers have begun removing nuclear
fuel from the reactor and are preparing to decommission it.
   Hock said layoffs are expected, but not for at least a month.
   He said the shutdown would not hurt the utility financially
because it already has written off the estimated costs.
   Fort St. Vrain never has operated for any length of time at 100
percent capacity. In 1984, a series of equipment problems closed the
plant for 22 months. In 1986, the NRC identified it as one of the 10
worst-run nuclear power plants in the United States. The agency took
it off the list last year.
   The latest shutdown came after a routine test Aug. 18 indicated a
problem with a control rod in the reactor's fuel core. While
replacing the faulty rod, crews discovered the cracks.
   Gas-cooled reactors have been widely used in Europe, but Fort St.
Vrain is the only one of its kind in the United States. Public
Service officials have blamed the choice of a water-lubricated
bearing for its turbine-like helium circulators for many of the
plant's problems, saying the bearing proved more sensitive than
anticipated.
   Fort St. Vrain also is the only U.S. commercial reactor with a
graphite fuel core. The Soviet reactor at Chernobyl, which exploded
and burned in 1986, had a graphite core, which was cooled by water
rather than helium.

   A weakening Tropical Storm Felix remained far out in
the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, its 40-mph winds causing problems
only for ships, forecasters said.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Felix's center was near 21.8 degrees north
latitude and 28.2 degrees west longitude, or about 380 miles
north-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands.
   The system, barely strong enough to remain a named storm, was
heading west- northwest at about 7 mph, with some increase in speed
likely, forecaster Hal Gerrish said at the National Hurricane Center
in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Felix's winds, which were at 50 mph on Monday, showed no sign of
picking up again, forecasters said.
   Felix is the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.
   A tropical depression becomes a named storm when sustained winds
reach 39 mph and a hurricane if winds climb to 74 mph. There have
been three hurricanes so far this season.

   Colombian Justice Minister Monica de Greiff
vowed Tuesday to stay on the job to fight her country's drug lords
and appealed for $19 million in new U.S. aid to protect judges from
the Medellin cartel.
   ``The law is under siege in Colombia and we must protect it every
way we can,'' Mrs. de Greiff told a news conference at the official
residence of the Colombian ambassador.
   ``I never considered resigning,'' she said in response to a
question about such reports. ``The threats are out there, but I am
satisfied with my protection right now.''
   The 32-year-old lawyer said she would go back to Colombia next
week after concluding discussions with the Bush administration about
her request for additional aid.
   ``I am determined that the integrity of our justice system
survives this crisis and I hope to play my full part in assuring
this,'' Mrs. de Greiff said.
   The justice minister, who met Monday with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and other top Justice Departments aides, continued talks
Tuesday with the Bush administration about her request for another
$19 million to protect Colombia's judges from assassination.
   The administration only last week approved a $65-million military
aid program, and the Pentagon said Tuesday that disbursement of
funds under that program is awaiting Colombia's list of needs.
   At the news conference, Mrs. de Greiff told reporters, ``We must
uphold the rule of law, and regrettably at this moment that requires
intensive physical protection of our judges.''
   The Bush administration has already promised $5 million over two
years for training programs to bolster judicial security.
   ``We have asked the United States for more support not only in
words but in resources,'' she told reporters. ``I am very pleased
with what we have done, I think we can do more, but I think we can
work out things.''
   Mrs. de Greiff, her country's eighth justice minister in three
years, said she told Thornburgh that Colombia needed the additional
aid to buy armored cars, metal detectors and other security devices
to protect judges from the wave of assassinations mounted by the
drug cartel.
   ``Both our countries are countries of laws even at a time when
our enemies are operating against us with no respect for law or even
the minimal standards of decency,'' she said.
   The State Department, meanwhile, updated its warning against
non-essential travel for U.S. citizens in Colombia and suggested,
for the first time, that American citizens living there consider
leaving.
   ``Although Americans have not yet been the target of any
violence, visitors and Americans resident in Colombia should
carefully re-evaluate whether it is essential that they travel to or
remain in Colombia at this time,'' said the new statement. ``The
department believes it would be prudent for those who deem their
presence non-essential to seriously consider leaving.''
   The last travel advisory, issued last weekend, was limited to
recommending that travel to Colombia be postponed for several weeks.
In addition to raising the possibility of resident U.S. citizens
leaving the country, the update also recommended that new travel to
Colombia be postponed indefinitely.
   President Bush, who discussed his anti-drug strategy with top
Cabinet officials at his Maine seaside retreat, said the
administration ``will cooperate with Colombia to the best of our
ability.''
   The president declined to comment specifically on Mrs. de
Greiff's request for more money but added that ``it's being worked
out now, the details.''
   The Pentagon said it will begin delivering military equipment
under the $65 million aid package as soon as it receives a list of
materiel sought by the Colombian government.
   ``When the list is returned to the United States delivery will
begin,'' Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams told reporters.
   ``Officials of both governments are now analyzing those needs,''
the spokesman said, adding, ``The DOD is ready to provide immediate
airlift.
   Williams declined to say what type of equipment would be
provided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons,
ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medical
supplies.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, raised the possibility that
its request to extradite drug trafficker Eduardo Martinez Ramirez
could be delayed while Colombia's Supreme Court reviews emergency
extradition procedures promulgated by President Virgilio Barco.
   ``Those extradition procedures are complicated, and I think there
is a possibility there may be a decision to have the Supreme Court
in Colombia rule on those new procedures,'' said spokesman David
Runkel.
   Runkel backed away from Thornburgh's earlier prediction that
Martinez would be turned over to U.S. authorities this week, saying
the procedure could take another week.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``we have every hope and expectation of
getting custody of Mr. Martinez.''
   Mrs. de Greiff, asked about Runkel's comments, said she did not
know about a possible Supreme Court review of the emergency
extradition procedures. In 1987, the court set aside Colombia's
extradition law.
   In a related development, the Justice Department persuaded the
Senate Judiciary Committee to cancel a hearing set for Wednesday on
the Colombian drug crisis out of concern that publicity could
endanger law enforcement efforts.
   Runkel said the department advised the panel that ``because of
the sensitive nature of the situation in Colombia at this time that
it would not be appropriate to have an open hearing.''
   David Westrate, the assistant administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration was set to testify.
   The panel's chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said in a
statement that committee members would be briefed privately this
week.
   Runkel said the Justice Department was also drafting extradition
requests for 12 other Colombian drug traffickers under federal

   The department wanted Colombia ``to have the paperwork so that

   Mrs. de Greiff was asked about whether her son understood the
danger posed by her continuation as justice minister.
   ``My son is three years old, I think he doesn't understand all of

safe and we are all safe.''

   A huge disk of hydrogen gas discovered 65
million light years away suggests that galaxies are still being
formed in the universe, a finding that could modify the current
theory that star systems formed within a relatively short time after
the ``big bang.''
   Riccardo Giovanelli, head of the Radio Astronomy Group at the
National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center in Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
and Martha Haynes, associate professor of astronomy at Cornell
University, found the gas cloud earlier this year using the
1,000-foot radiotelescope dish at Arecibo.
   Others astronomers said Tuesday that the findings were
``exciting'' and ``important'' and could reshape the current view of
the history of the universe.
   The cloud of hydrogen gas is 10 times larger in diameter than the
Milky Way Galaxy, which includes the sun, and appears to be in the
shape of a disk that is rotating slowly, the National Science
Foundation announced.
   Carl Heiles, a professor of astronomy at the University of
California, Berkeley, said the gas cloud ``is a very important
discovery.''
   ``It shows that there are clouds of gas out there that have not
yet turned into galaxies,'' he said. Further study, said Heiles,
could lead to modifications of the basic ``big bang'' concept of the
universe.
   The ``big bang'' theory postulates that the universe began with a
cataclysmic explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago and that
galaxies of stars formed within a few hundred million years after
that. Astronomers have earlier reported findings that suggested star
formation within existing galaxies, and studies that indicated that
some galaxies may have formed billions of years later than others.
   But there have been no earlier reported findings of true
``proto-galaxies,'' or star systems at the very beginning of
formation. The general belief has been that such formation halted
billions of years ago.
   Giovanelli and Haynes said they made the discovery through luck.
They were attempting to calibrate the radiotelescope by aiming it at
a part of the sky they thought was empty.
   ``Before stumbling into this thing, neither I nor Martha were
great believers in the existence of such objects,'' Giovanelli said
in a statement. ``But this cloud indicates that the disks of
galaxies can form slowly throughout the history of the universe and
not just be something that happened during some magic period of the
distant past.''
   Gas clouds have been discovered in the heavens, but those were
associated with existing galaxies.
   ``This cloud seems to have formed independently, in a pocket of
space isolated from other galaxies,'' said Giovanelli.
   No stars were found in the gas cloud.
   Most astronomers believe that galaxies form when hydrogen atoms
collect in
   huge clouds that are collapsed by gravity and that form clumps
that further gravitational collapse turn into stars.
   Giovanelli and Haynes estimated the mass of the cloud at about a
tenth of the Milky Way, which contains billions of stars.
   Heiles said the relatively small mass of the cloud presents no
problems to the theory that it is a proto-galaxy.
   ``There are lots of small galaxies out there, lots that are about
10 percent the size of our Milky Way,'' he said.
   James Rose, an associate professor of astromony at the University
of North Carolina who has studied young galaxies, called the new
finding ``very exciting.''
   ``This would be the first time that we could see a mass of gas
changing itself into a galaxy,'' he said. ``It offers the
opportunity to study the process in great detail.''
   Rose said that fact that the cloud is close to Earth by
astronomical standards, just 65 million light years away, will help
astronomers study it. A light year is a measure of distance used by
astronomers. It is the distance that light travels through a vacuum
in one year, about 5.7 trillion miles.
   Heiles said the next step now is to conduct a careful search for
other such clouds in the universe. He said astronomers may find that
there are many other such clouds, or forming galaxies.
   Presently, said Heiles, it is believed that vast areas of the
heavens are devoid of any matter. He said a survey might find that
many of those voids are not empty at all, but filled with hydrogen
clouds, or proto-galaxies.

<HEAD>Showdown Looms Between Government, Labor as Teachers Plan Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A showdown between the new
government and organized labor shaped up on Tuesday as bus drivers
in the capital refused to work and teachers prepared a nationwide
strike.
   The bus drivers and teachers, along with doctors in municipal
hospitals and public employees in the provinces, are demanding
salary increases that exceed guidelines set by the economy and labor
ministries.
   ``We insist on a pay floor of 75,000 australs (about $114) for
the month of August,'' said Maria Sanchez, secretary-general of the
200,000-member Confederation of Argentine Educators.
   The monthly base now is about $46. The 48-hour strike was to
begin Wednesday.
   Menem belongs to the Peronist Party, whose traditional base is
organized labor, but government and labor have been heading for a
clash since he was sworn in as president on July 8.
   Faced with a huge budget deficit and hyperinflation, the new
government raised public utility rates by several hundred percent,
pledged to sell off money-losing state companies, and implemented
``voluntary'' wage and price controls.
   The Labor Ministry threatened to revoke collective bargaining
pacts that exceeded 175 percent for the July-September period. Most
fell within that limit, though the cost of living soared by 197
percent in July alone.
   Labor leaders complained that workers cannot pay the higher
utility rates, face firings or reduced wages in any privatization
plan, and that the guidelines allowed prices to rise higher than
wages.
   ``My main obligation is to defend the interests of workers,''
Saul Ubaldini, leader of the 3 million-member General Labor
Confederation, said. ``I'm Peronist, but I'm not servile to
anybody.''
   To restart an economy in recession, Menem is willing to make
concessions to business that organized labor is not inclined to
accept.
   On Tuesday, Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli proposed that as a
temporary measure, businesses be allowed to hire employees for up to
three years with no commitments to job security or unemployment
insurance.
   On Tuesday, bus drivers demanding a raise of 36 percent over the
recently negotiated monthly pay floor of about $95 refused to charge
passengers. Many owners pulled their buses off the streets.
   Coffins piled up in cemeteries in La Matanza, the most densely
populated district of metropolitan Buenos Aires, as municipal
workers, including grave diggers, refused to work.
   Public employees in Mar del Plata and San Miguel de Tucuman
struck for higher pay. Butchers in Rosario, Argentina's
third-biggest city, refused to pay electricity bills that are up to
2,500 percent higher than the previous month.
   The Menem government, conscious of the food riots that shook the
country last May, has tried to ease the way for its program of
economic restructuring.
   Private and public sector workers have received clothing
allowances, one-time bonuses and advances on monthly salaries. Soup
kitchens feed hundreds of thousands of hungry Argentines in the
countryside.
   Some progress has been reported under the new government.
Inflation is projected to increase by 35 percent in August, and by
10 percent or less in September.
   Real wages in July were about 30 percent higher than in June.
   The austral currency has stabilized against the dollar and
interest rates have plunged. Prices in supermarkets and department
stores have come down slightly.

<HEAD>British TV Satellite Fired into Orbit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A communications satellite that was
the first payload put in orbit by a privately owned rocket was
parked in a permanent orbit Tuesday by a radio-controlled motor
aboard the satellite.
   The 2,700-pound Marcopolo I, which will beam televison programs
to British homes, was launched into a preliminary elliptical orbit
Sunday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station atop a three-stage
Delta rocket made by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.
   Ground controllers tracked the satellite for nearly two days to
determine its orbital path, then sent a radio signal at 9:52 a.m.
EDT to fire the motor.
   Hughes Aircraft Co., which built the satellite for a British
broadcasting company, said the motor fired perfectly to kick the
spacecraft into a circular orbit 22,300 miles above the Atlantic
Ocean, overlooking the British Isles.
   ``Everything is checking out very well. All the systems are
operating the way they should be,'' said Hughes spokesman Richard
Dore. ``This has been a very smooth transition into space.''
   The satellite's antenna and solar panels, which provide power,
are expected to be deployed Thursday, Dore said.
   After being checked for several months, Marcopolo I will begin
beaming television signals to Britain next spring, said Anthony
Simonds-Gooding, chief executive officer of British Satellite
Broadcasting Ltd., which will operate the system.
   Marcopolo I is the first of two satellites designed to transmit
television programs for a fraction of the cost of cable systems
directly to British homes equipped with a 12-inch dish antenna, a
box on top of the TV set and a remote control unit.
   The second satellite is scheduled for launch in mid-1990.
   The launch was a milestone in the U.S. commercial space program
started after the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   President Reagan ordered the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to stop launching payloads for commercial customers
from the space shuttle, and said the job should be done by private
industry using unmanned rockets.

   A huge coal-burning power plant in Arizona is
contaminating the once pristine air over the Grand Canyon and may be
forced to install expensive pollution controls, the Environmental
Protection Agency said Tuesday.
   The EPA said it will determine by next February how much
emissions of sulfur dioxide will have to be curbed at the partially
government-owned Navajo Generating Station 80 miles from the center
of the Grand Canyon.
   The plant, one of the largest in the country, burns 24,000 tons
of coal a day and releases an estimated 12 to 13 tons of sulfur
dioxide from its 750-foot smokestacks hourly.
   Much of the pollution has been finding its way as sulfate
particles over the Grand Canyon, causing a white haze over the
canyon during much of the year, especially in the winter months,
according to environmentalists and park operators.
   The operators of the Navajo plant near Page, Ariz., have said
that costs for pollution curbs _ possibly expensive ``scrubbers'' to
reduce sulfur releases _ could be as high $1 billion, although other
estimates have been in the $300 million to $400 million range.
   The EPA, which is under a court-imposed agreement to resolve the
Grand Canyon pollution problem and determine to what extend the
power plant is at fault, said there is ``substantial evidence'' that
the 2,250-megawatt plant is a ``major contributor'' to the canyon's
pollution problems.
   The EPA cited a $2 million six-week study by the National Park
Service in 1987 and early 1988 that concluded that on average 40
percent of the air pollution over the canyon came from the power
plant. On some days during the study period the plant was blamed for
as much as 70 percent of the pollution.
   The Park Service used a chemical tracer that was released with
the plant's other emissions and then tracked how the winds carried
the pollutants over the canyon.
   ``We have substantial evidence that the Navajo Generating Station
is a significant contributor to the visiblity problem,'' said F.
Henry Habicht, the EPA's deputy administrator. ``Action must be
taken now to protect the Grand Canyon.''
   But officials of the Salt River Project, operator of the plant,
have argued that they should not be required to install expensive
pollution control equipment because, they say, the contamination
over the canyon comes from other sources as well, including
pollution drifting from the Los Angeles area and Mexico.
   While the Park Service contends its study clearly shows the power
plant to be the major cause of the canyon's air pollution problems,
another agency in the Interior Department, the Bureau of
Reclamation, has sided with the plant's operators.
   D. Michael Rappoport, an SRP executive in Washington, said, ``We
intend to test the reason and rationale employed by EPA, the Park
Service and the Environmental Defense Fund during the comment
process and, if necessary, in court.
   ``At a time when the press and policy-makers are rediscovering
the environment, we're not at all surprised by the EPA decision,''
said Rappoport, who direct's the SRP's government relations.
   Ed Norton, director of the Grand Canyon Trust, called the EPA's
move ``another encouraging example that EPA under Bill Reilly is
going to make strong decisions to defend the environment.''
   Nevertheless, Norton said, ``It's by no means the end of the
issue because the major controversy _ the pollution-control strategy
_ is ahead of us.''
   The Bureau of Reclamation, which owns 24 percent of the plant and
relies on its electricty to pump water from the Colorado River into
irregation projects in central Arizona, has maintained that further
studies are needed before new pollution curbs should be required at
the plant.
   Despite the Park Service study, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
said Tuesday he is not convinced the power plant is the leading
culprit in the Grand Canyon air pollution problems. He said he would
like the National Academy of Sciences to review the Park Service
findings.
   ``We have two bureaus (within the department) that disagreed.
What we seek is a disinterested third party,'' said a department
spokesman, when asked to elaborate on Lujan's statement.
   Environmentalists charge that the Bureau of Reclamation is trying
to discredit the Park Service study because as much as one-fourth of
the cost of additional pollution controls at the plant _ as much as
$250 million, according to some estimates _ could come eventually
out of the bureau's budget.
   While the EPA concluded Tuesday that the plant is a major
contributor to the canyon's pollution, it held off until next
February to determine how much it wants the plant to curb its
emissions and by what means those reductions will be attained.
   Bob Yuhnke, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
that with the federal government likely to bear much of the cost of
pollution controls, the EPA will be under pressure to hold down the
cost of any emissions control plan.
   The EPA is under a court order to impose specific curbs on the
Navajo plant by next Feb. 1 as a result of a settlement of a lawsuit
filed by the Environmental Defense Fund.
   Federal clean air laws require the EPA to take action against
polluters that impair visibility in federal parks such as the Grand
Canyon.

   Developers and city officials from Las Vegas,
Nev., will appeal a court decision protecting the desert tortoise,
which has been listed as an endangered species by the federal
government.
   The group of businessmen and officials filed suit in U.S.
District Court, fearing that a real estate boom in Las Vegas will be
hurt by an Aug. 4 emergency regulation issued by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. It is designed to leave desert tortoises
undisturbed.
   Issued under the Endangered Species Act, the rule could severely
restrict development on land inhabited by the Mojave population of
wild desert tortoises.
   Covered by the regulation are portions of California,
southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, as well as southern
Nevada including Las Vegas, the scene of substantial commercial and
residential growth.
   In a decision last Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Stanley
Harris refused to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement
of the rule.
   The federal government issued the regulation after an outbreak of
respiratory disease among wild desert tortoise populations. But
there is no scientific evidence that the disease affected tortoises
in Nevada, said the city of Las Vegas, which argued that the
regulation should have been confined to areas affected by the
disease.
   In his decision, Harris agreed that it would have been
``significantly preferable'' to limit the geographic scope of the
emergency rule. But he said nothing in the Endangered Species Act
requires the wildlife service ``to limit the chaos caused to
productive human enterprises ... based on geographic ... concerns.''
   The wildlife service's rule ``calls a halt to an awful lot of
development activity because the Las Vegas area is within the
habitat'' of the desert tortoise, said Irwin Goldbloom, one of the
lawyers representing the Nevada interests filing suit.
   In an interview Tuesday, Goldbloom said some construction already
has been stopped in the Las Vegas area because of the rule. He said
the Nevada officials and developers will go to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in an attempt to overturn the emergency regulation.
   One court filing in the case said the city of Las Vegas stands to
lose $11 million a year in lost tax revenue, building permit fees
and other income due to the regulation.
   Del Webb Communities Inc., a developer, says the emergency rule
``could lead to staggering interest costs'' and could jeopardize
completion of construction projects.
   Environmental groups have been pushing since 1984 to place the
desert tortoise on the list of endangered species.
   The federal government stated in court papers that the emergency
listing ``will ... place additional constraints on ... industries
... to help prevent ... extinction'' of the tortoises.
   ``Given the longstanding consideration of the desert tortoise''
for listing as an endangered species, the group of developers and
officials from Nevada ``should have been aware'' of that
``eventuality,'' said Justice Department lawyers.

<TEXT>
   A government official said Tuesday police
are fighting indiscriminate burning and tree-cutting in parts of the
Amazon rain forest under emergency measures that already have
brought $9 million in fines.
   Jose Roberto Lima, a spokesman for the state's Brazilian
Environmental Institute, said institute agents and federal police
began patrolling part of the Amazon jungle in five helicopters in
early August.
   In that month, ranchers and farmers traditionally begin to burn
off forest growth for pasture and planting.
   ``The area is wild and the settlers extremely dangerous. If you
don't police the jungle with a machine gun on your side, you're as
good as dead,'' Lima said in an interview.
   He said agents had handed out fines of about $9 million in the
first 15 days of the exercise.
   Among those fined were farmers, ranchers, steel mills that use
wood to fuel blast furnaces and 15 sawmills.
   Lima said fines will be used to support an emergency
environmental package called ``Our Nature'' announced earlier this
year.
   Amid mounting world concern that the destruction of the forest
could disastrously change global weather, the Brazilian government
also this year suspended incentives for large-scale agricultural and
cattle ranching projects and created a special police force to
control fires.
   Satellite photographs show that in the past 10 years the 2
million-square-mile rain forest, the world's largest, has lost an
area half the size of West Virginia to slashing, burning and mining.
   Ecologists charge the government has done little to discourage
the uncontrolled destruction.
   Brazil initially refused offers of help from international
organizations and foreign governments, saying that would amount to
meddling in its internal affairs but has softened that position in
recent months.
   The government earlier this year turned down offers from the
United States, France and the Netherlands to discuss swapping part
of Brazil's $115 million debt for preserving Amazon land, which
covers two-thirds of Brazil and is home to 15 million people.
   But Lima said the institute hopes to receive help from foreign
governments to strengthen its efforts.
   Italy and Canada already have promised five tanker planes to help
put out forest fires, he said.
   In just 25 hours of flights over the so-called Parrot's Beak
region in southern Para _ the site of bloody clashes between peasant
farmers and large landowners _ agents found 150 areas where the
forest was being illegally destroyed, Lima said.
   He said the patrols have rescued 150 animals and 120 birds, some
threatened with extinction.
   The patrols will continue for three months over the jungle states
of Para, Mato Grosso, Rondonia and Acre, Lima said. The so-called
Legal Amazon also includes the states of Amapa, Roraima, Maranhao,
Tocantins and Amazonas.
   Uncontrolled colonization has destroyed more than 5 percent of
the rain forest, satellite photos show. Some researchers put the
figure at nearer 10 percent.

   The National Football League on Tuesday suspended
13 players who tested positive for steroids in its first crackdown
on the muscle-building drug, as well as two athletes accused of
using illegal drugs.
   The steroid suspensions included only one prominent player,
former Pro Bowl guard Ron Solt of the Philadelphia Eagles. The two
suspended under the substance-abuse policy were far more prominent _
cornerback Leroy Irvin, a former All-Pro from the Los Angeles Rams
and tight end Orson Mobley of the Denver Broncos, who played on both
of Denver's Super Bowl teams.
   The players came from nine of the NFL's 28 teams. The most,
three, were from the Buffalo Bills. There were two each from the
Green Bay Packers, the New York Jets, the Los Angeles Rams and San
Francisco 49ers. All 15 received four-game suspensions.
   Eagles' general manager Harry Gamble said he was disappointed
with Solt, but ``he's still an important part of the football team.''
   Bills general manager Bill Polian said he would welcome back his
three suspended players.
   ``They are not druggies,'' Polian said. ``They're not felons,
they're not bad kids. They're good kids who made a mistake and are
paying the penalty for it.''
   Other than Solt, who is recuperating from operations on both
knees, the best-known player in the steroids crackdown is Maurice
Douglass, a backup defensive back for the Chicago Bears who spends
the off-season as an exotic dancer.
   Most seemed to fall into the category defined by U.S. District
Judge Thomas Hogan on Monday, who in turning down the players' union
request to halt the suspensions, acknowledged the crackdown ``could
be fatal to a marginal player.''
   The league, which tested 2,200 players in training camps, said an
unspecified number of others tested positive but had been cut ``for
lack of playing ability.''
   Others suspended for steroids were: running back Sean Doctor and
his linebacker brother, Tom Doctor, both of Buffalo; linebacker Matt
Jaworski of Buffalo, offensive linemen Mike Ariey and Keith Uecker
of Green Bay; defensive end Mark Mraz of the Los Angeles Raiders;
tight end Vernon Kirk of the Los Angeles Rams; running back Vince
Amoia and wide receiver Bobby Riley of the New York Jets; and
running back Keith Henderson and nose tackle Rollin Putzier of San
Francisco.
   The NFL Players Association challenged the testing's accuracy,
saying players had called the union claiming they were innocent and
suggesting the tests may have mistaken other medication as either
steroids or ``masking agents'' for the drugs.
   But NFL spokesman Joe Browne said, ``We conducted Olympic-caliber
testing that takes everything into account.'' Olympic athletes are
routinely tested for steroids.
   A league statement, however, acknowledged that the NFL could not
guarantee the testing detected or will detect every steroid user in
the league.
   The suspended players must remain away from their teams' training
facilities until Sept. 27, the NFL said. If the drugs remain in
their system after that date, they will continue to be suspended.
   The league said that if another random test found evidence of
steroids in a suspended player again, he would be banned for the
rest of the season.

   Nancy Reagan said fear wasn't keeping her away
from a school in a gang-infested neighborhood. The former first lady
said Tuesday she was never invited to appear at the school.
   Board of Education member Rita Walters had criticized Mrs.
Reagan, saying her refusal to appear next month at John Muir Junior
High School to present an anti-drug grant was an insult to the
community.
   ``The issue is the insult that is rendered when you're going to
give money for a program in one community but you're afraid to go
into the community,'' Walters said Monday night.
   Deputy Police Chief Glenn Levant called a news conference Tuesday
to clear up the controversy, saying it turns out to be ``much ado
about nothing.''
   ``The only thing I can surmise is the school board was not
presented all of the facts. There's nothing political about drug
abuse,'' Levant said.
   Mrs. Reagan will present a $50,000 Nancy Reagan Foundation grant
for school anti-drug programs on Sept. 14 during Drug Abuse
Resistance Education Day ceremonies at Gates Street School in
Lincoln Heights.
   ``My only goal is to help keep our kids away from drugs. I will
continue to take my campaign to every corner of our community,''
Mrs. Reagan said in a statement issued Tuesday.
   A portion of the money was earmarked for the John Muir school and
the school board staff told Walters the former first lady wouldn't
go to the south-central Los Angeles neighborhood due to security
concerns.
   But Mrs. Reagan said she was never invited to appear at John Muir.
   ``There simply was no invitation, request or expression of
interest conveyed to the foundation or me that I make the
presentation at John Muir Junior High School,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   DARE program officials picked the location for the ceremony.
   Levant said once Mrs. Reagan became aware of the controversy, she
changed her plans to include a second appearance at John Muir.
   Walters on Tuesday said she was unaware Mrs. Reagan's appearance
at Gates Street School was for the DARE event, not just for John
Muir's program. She said her information about the security concern
came from the board staff.
   ``But even after finding out that it was part of a larger program
I still maintain that it was inappropriate to make a gift to Muir''
at another school, Walters said.
   ``Whoever did what, I don't know at this point, but the important
point at this moment is that Mrs. Reagan will be coming to John
Muir,'' she said.

days ago in this southeastern region, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
   The agency said the five were among nine villagers abducted from
Dilekli village in Yuksekova township. It said the rebels had freed
the other four villagers.
   Guerrillas linked with the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party have been
attacking military outposts and killing civilians and soldiers in
the area since 1984. The Marxist group seeks to set up an
independent Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of 55

<TEXT>
   President Bush's only daughter,
Dorothy, has separated from her husband, William LeBlond, sources
told The Associated Press.
   The White House officially issued no comment on the separation,
which was confirmed by sources close to the family. First Lady
Barbara Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, said only, ``It's her
private affair.'' She said there would be no other comment.
   Bush spokesman Steve Hart also declined comment.
   One source said the White House was ``taking a firm position''
not to talk about the matter.
   Mrs. LeBlond, 30, has been with her parents during much of the
president's vacation at his seaside home that began Aug. 16. She
frequently jogs with her father in the morning.
   She lives in nearby Cape Elizabeth and works as head of the Maine
tourism bureau.
   She celebrated her birthday on Aug. 18 at the family vacation
home on Walker's Point, with many relatives present. White House
sources said her husband, a construction contractor, was absent.
   The Bush family apparently has decided not to publicly discuss
the separation, which is the only one that has occurred among the
president's five children.
   ``They're not thrilled but what can they do?'' said one source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The LeBlonds have two young children, Sam and Ellie.

   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
adopted but later rejected a measure on abortion Tuesday that some
interpreted as pro-choice. A neutral version was later approved.
   In drawn-out, emotional sessions of the denomination's assembly,
delegates voted down an initially approved statement after several
said it upheld access to abortion.
   ``Some felt it supported abortion on demand, others that it did
not,'' said the Rev. Herbert Knutsen of Rice Lake, Wis., urging
reconsideration of the statement. The original was tossed out, then
revived in changed form.
   ``It was not intended to be divisive,'' said Louise Shoemaker of
Philadelphia who sponsored the original resolution.
   She proposed the amended version, eliminating an earlier phrase
calling for ``free acess to services'' and substituting ``personal
care, information, counseling and competent Christian guidance.''
   A nurse, Betty Jane Reisner of Whitehall, Pa., pleaded against
the substitute, saying, ``Pro-choice allows pro-life. The reverse is
not true. This is taking away our freedom.''
   Robert Vargas of Woodville, Wis., and others urged retention of
the original statement because of the the church's diversity and to
give ``opportunity for ministry to one and all.''
   The question had been simmering several days among delegates of
the newly merged 5.3-million-member denomination, which had taken no
stand on the issue.
   ``We must begin to lead or be led,'' said Guy Erwin of New Haven,
Conn. Calling the issue ``urgent, excruciating and personal,'' he
urged prompt post-assembly study and action by the church's interim
policy-making counsel.
   ``We must risk deep disagreement for the sake of the church,''
Erwin said.
   Favoring the original measure, Anne Cuba, a Binghamton, N.Y.,
nurse, appealed for Christians to ``trust women'' and give them the
``freedom to make their best choices in God's world.''
   But in a pained voice, the Rev. Paul Hinlicky of Delhi, N.Y.,
exclaimed, ``I will not obey this call for free access to abortion
on demand!''
   The three denominations that merged into the new body had taken
differing positions on abortion, from accepting it in limited
circumstances and defining human life as beginning at conception to
stressing the right to personal choice.
   The eight-day assembly, which ends Wednesday, is the first since
the 1988 merger of the Lutheran Church in America, the American
Lutheran Church and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.

<HEAD>Three Stroessner Generals Offer Restitution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three generals offered Tuesday to
return millions of dollars in cash and property if officials drop
charges that they illegally enriched themselves under the 34-year
Stroessner regime, their attorneys said.
   The offers come as auditors reportedly are uncovering massive
irregularities at state companies and agencies following the
February overthrow of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   President Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who toppled Stroessner and then
was overwhelmingly elected president on May 1, has pledged to
recover and redistribute property and goods stolen from the
government and people of Paraguay.
   Gen. Roberto Knopfelmacher, who after the coup was ousted from
his position running the national steel company, offered to return
$4 million to the government, his lawyer said on condition of
anonymity.
   Hugo de Jesus Araujo, the general who used to direct the
Institute of Social Planning, offered several mansions, a 2,470-acre
ranch and cash, his attorney said, also on condition of anonymity.
   Former police chief Alcibiades Britez, another general, said
through his atorney he would make 20,470 acres of land available to
landless peasants.
   The new director of Paraguayan Steel Inc. accepted
Knopfelmacher's offer, but said the audit will continue and the
retired general may have to return more assets.
   The Institute of Social Planning did not accept or reject the
offer of Araujo, whose arrest pending trial has been ordered by a
judge.

<HEAD>Brazil Fighting Hepatitis and Malaria in Amazon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Health Ministry said Tuesday it is
starting a multimillion-dollar campaign to stop the spread of
hepatitis and malaria _ the centuries-old scourges that kill
thousands each year in the Amazon jungle.
   The campaign is to include spraying huts and lean-tos in the
Amazon rain forest with $198-million worth of DDT, the cheap but
powerful insecticide banned in many countries.
   Health Minister Seigo Tsuzuki said the World Bank will help pay
for the DDT-spraying campaign.
   In an interview, he said Brazil begins a $4.4 million vaccination
campaign Thursday against hepatitis ``B'' in Lambrea, a backwoods
town in Amazonas state known for its high incidence of the illness.
   Some 93,000 children under nine years old will be given Belgian
vaccines in what Tsuzuki claimed is the world's first mass
immunization against the disease that inflames the liver.
   Some 10,000 workers will be involved in the campaign, which will
be monitored by scientists from Cuba, France, Belgium and the World
Health Organization, Tsuzuki said in an interview.
   In Brazil, hepatitis afflicts 7.4 percent of the population and
malaria 3.3 percent, according to government statistics. The
ministry says four of every 1,000 Amazon residents die each year
from hepatitis.
   Tsuzuki said the government plans to use the vaccine nationwide,
in hopes of bringing the disease under control within three years.
   To contain malaria, they plan a five-year campaign involving
$198-million worth of DDT, he said.
   Last year, the ministry registered 560,000 cases of malaria in
Brazil, up from 500,000 a year earlier. The number is expected to
rise again this year.
   Malaria is almost exclusively a problem of Amazonia, a 2 million-
square-mile wilderness sprawled across northern and western Brazil.
   The government plans to send 70,000 army troops to the region to
begin spraying now that the four-month rainy season has ended,
Tsuzuki said.
   He said DDT is cheap and effective against the anopheles
mosquito, which carries malaria.
   The insecticide will not be used indiscriminately, but only to
spray inside the huts and lean-tos used by miners and settlers, he
said.
   He said World Bank loans will help pay for the DDT campaign.
   During the 1964-1985 military regime, the generals in power urged
poor Brazilians to settle in the undeveloped Amazon and offered
numerous tax incentives and state subsidies to ranchers and
developers.
   Since the drive began in the 1970s, the incidence of malaria has
risen more than 500 percent, the ministry says.
   Malaria causes fever and chills and a gradual weakening of the
body. It can be fatal if not treated. In Brazil, between 1 and 2
percent of those who get the disease die from it, Dr. Agostinho Cruz
Marquez of the ministry's Malaria Institute told the AP.

<TEXT>
   Researchers spent evenings and weekends
to find the world's largest known prime number, even though it has
no practical use, the company said Tuesday.
   ``It's like going to the moon, in a sense; there's not a lot
there, but it's important scientifically to do it because the
technology proves so useful,'' said Bodo Parady, one of six
researchers for Sunnyvale-based computer maker Amdahl Corp. who came
up with the number.
   There's no simple way to express the largest prime number. But it
equals 391,581 multiplied by 2 to the 216,193rd power, minus one.
   The number has 65,087 digits, 600 times as many as the number of
atoms in the known universe, according to Sergio E. Zarantonello,
another of the researchers.
   A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 that can only
be evenly divided by 1 or by itself. For example, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 17
are prime numbers.
   The new biggest known prime number, determined Aug. 6, beats the
record set in 1985 by David Slowinski of Cray Research Inc., the
U.S. supercomputer maker. The new number has 37 more digits and is a
trillion, trillion, trillion times larger.
   ``Searching for a largest known prime number is like looking for
a needle in a haystack, since only about one in 150,000 numbers is
prime in the region where the new record was found,'' Zarantonello
wrote in a company memo.
   The discovery was also announced at a meeting this week of the
American Mathematical Society.
   Although the number has no known practical application, the
standard advanced multiplication programs that were honed by Amdahl
scientists during the search already are being used by scientists
searching for pulsars, the company said.
   The process has other applications, particularly in cryptology
and in bank transaction coding. Both systems can depend on using
large prime numbers.

   Teachers strikes Tuesday idled more than 37,000 pupils in
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and one small district
that tried to hold classes was stymied by picket line violence.
   Three pickets in Indian Creek, Ohio, told police they were hit by
cars or a bus, and one teacher was arrested on charges of blocking a
bus and breaking a window. No serious injuries were reported, but
the school board voted to suspend classes until Tuesday because of
``the intensity of picket line activities'' said Superintendent
Charles Aguiar.
   Pay and benefits were the major strike issues for about 2,200
teachers who walked out in nine small districts in the four states.
   In northeast Ohio's Warren County, a district $6 million in debt,
550 teachers accepted a proposed two-year wage freeze but struck to
demand a 10 percent pay raise in the third year and an elementary
class size limit of 30 instead of 36.
   The strikes so far have spared any large school systems. But the
leadership of unions representing 4,700 teachers in two Sacramento,
Calif., area districts have voted to strike over pay on Sept. 5, the
first day of school for 94,000 pupils.

<TEXT>
   John H. Steinway, great-grandson of the founder
of the famed Steinway &amp; Sons piano company and an executive with the
company since 1946, died early Tuesday. He was 72.
   Steinway, who became ill while vacationing, died at a Plymouth,
Mass., hospital at 5 a.m., according to company spokeswoman Nancy
Shear. The cause of death was not immediately known.
   His death leaves just one member of the family _ his brother,
Henry Z. _ still working for the company that makes pianos favored
by such performers as Vladimir Horowitz.
   Steinway was born in Plymouth, Mass. His great-grandfather, Henry
E. Steinway, left Germany for the United States in 1853, and founded
the piano company here.
   After graduating from Bard College, John Steinway began working
at the family business in 1939, starting by ``schlepping lumber
around the yard'' at the company's factory, he recalled last year.
   After Army service during World War II, he returned to Steinway
in 1946, moving through the corporate ranks until he became chairman
of the board. In recent years, he served as a company spokesman and
spent his days in the company's offices near Carnegie Hall.
   In addition to Henry Steinway, he is survived by another brother,
Frederick and sisters Elizabeth Chapin and Lydia Cochrane.

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alabama, one of the nation's biggest
dumping grounds for toxic waste, announced a ban Tuesday on
hazardous waste shipments from 22 states and the District of
Columbia.
   Gov. Guy Hunt said the ban _ the second in the nation _ was
necessary to prevent ``Alabama from becoming the waste dump of the
nation.''
   Alabama's ban mirrors one enacted earlier this year in South
Carolina. The Alabama ban takes effect Sept. 14, but may wind up in
court.
   Richard Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous Waste
Treatment Council in Washington, said the lobbying group is
determined to overturn Alabama and South Carolina's laws. He said
the state laws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and will
produce a shortage of sites nationally to handle hazardous waste.
   ``It is virually certain we will challenge one,'' Fortuna said.
``The only question is whether we will challenge both.''
   According to figures compiled by state environmental officials,
Alabama is fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it gets from
other states. When the amount of waste shipped out of each state is
compared to the amount brought in, Alabama jumps to No. 2 in net
intake. Indiana is listed first in amount received as well as net
intake.
   Alabama's ban comes from a new state law that says states can't
ship hazardous wastes to Alabama if they don't allow for disposal of
hazardous wastes within their own borders or don't have a
cooperative agreement with Alabama. Alabama has signed no
cooperative agreements.
   The law was approved by the Legislature and the governor in May,
but the lawmakers left it up to the state Department of
Environmental Management to determine which states would be
affected. A list was released Tuesday.
   Sue Robertson, chief of the department's land division, said the
ban only affects a landfill at Emelle, which is the nation's largest
hazardous waste landfill. The law leaves it up to the landfill
operator, Chemical Waste Management, to deny shipments from the
banned states.
   Chemical Waste spokesman Chris Grimshawe said the company is
still studying the list and will decide whether to take legal action.
   A violation of the ban is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
and a $10,000 fine. The state could also go to court to seek civil
penalties of up to $25,000 per day per violation.
   Among the banned states, 18 and the District of Columbia have no
disposal facilities. They are Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida,
Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont,
Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
   Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington state were banned because
they did not respond to the state's request for information about
hazardous waste disposal within their borders.

<TEXT>
   Most South Koreans believe U.S. troops
should remain here to help defend their country, and 64 percent
worry North Korea may invade again, according to a survey published
Wednesday.
   The poll, conducted by independent Korea Research for the
Ministry of Culture and Information, said 94.07 percent of those
interviewed believe the 43,00 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea
under a mutual defense pact should stay.
   Radical students and dissidents, a small but vocal minority,
daily stage violent protests demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops
whose presence they believe hinders unification with North Korea.
   Some U.S. politicians have said plans should be made for a
gradual phasing out of American troops because they consider South
Korea able to defend itself.
   According to the poll, only 5.93 percent of those questioned
support demands for immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. And 81
percent feel conditions will change in 10 years and South Korea will
be able to defend itself.
   The Ministry of Culture and Information said the survey was
conducted among 1,500 South Koreans aged over 20 and randomly
selected from around the country between July 28 and Aug. 16.
   Details on polling techniques were not available and pollsters
did not figure a margin of error.
   North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start a bloody
three-year war, and the poll said 84.2 percent of those polled feel
their country would have become communist if U.S. troops had not
helped. A cease-fire ended the war. But a peace treaty was never
signed and the two Koreas remain enemies.
   The survey said 64 percent of those questioned fear North Korea
may invade again, and 23 percent do not. It said 60.4 percent

<TEXT>
   A government agency is no longer
considering a ranch near this border city for underground explosives
tests, but agency officials said it's looking at another site in the
area.
   The Defense Nuclear Agency had been looking at a site on the Buck
King Ranch 25 miles northwest of Del Rio.
   ``I'm convinced that they are out _ out of Del Rio, out of Val
Verde County,'' Del Rio Mayor Alfredo Gutierrez Jr. said Monday
evening after the agency's announcement. ``I think we're through
with the DNA.''
   Gutierrez and other local leaders staged a rally against the
underground explosion testing, which some residents fear could
damage the city's sole source of drinking water, the San Felipe
Springs. Del Rio, with 40,000 residents, is in southwestern Texas,
on the U.S.-Mexico border.
   The series of blasts, known as ``DUGHEST'' for ``Deep Underground
High Explosive Simulation Test,'' are designed to simulate the
impact of nuclear explosions on subterranean missile silos. They
would start in 1990 with a 1,000-pound charge and culminate in
November 1992 with a 470-ton blast using conventional explosives,
federal officials have said.
   In a letter to congressional leaders, Vice Adm. John T. Parker
Jr. of the Defense Nuclear Agency said the Buck King Ranch was no
longer under consideration. He said the agency's preliminary
analysis of rock core from the ranch indicated it ``was less useful
for the experiment than we anticipated.''
   But he added, ``We are interested in investigating other Texas
sites, one of which is in western Val Verde County much farther from
Del Rio than the Buck King ranch.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposed the ranch site, said he
would try to block funding for the project if other sites in the
county are considered.
   ``If you do choose to proceed with an investigation of other test
sites in Val Verde County, however, you should know that I will
introduce an amendment to the Defense Department appropriations bill
to deny DNA the funding necessary to pursue this project,'' Gramm
wrote Parker.
   Potential damage to drinking water was the top concern among the
approximately 1,000 people attending Monday's demonstration.
   Sylvia Urby, a former city councilwoman, said ``We certainly
don't want this to happen to Del Rio _ our spring water is our life
here.''

   A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted a former
Department of Housing and Urban Development accountant on charges he
embezzled more than $1 million in public funds intended for
low-income housing projects.
   Douglas R. Turner is accused of depositing into his private
account money from a program that gives developers subsidies to
build housing for low-income people, U.S. Attorney Mike Norton said
at a news conference.
   ``I believe it will be the first in a series of criminal
prosecutions in this HUD area,'' said Norton, referring to the
Colorado regional office.
   Colorado FBI chief Bob Pence said the Turner case, discovered
during a routine HUD audit, ``lifted the lid off what is beginning
to look ... like a mess.''
   HUD has been beset with allegations of fraud, embezzlemet and
influence peddling nationally during the Reagan administration.
Secretary Jack Kemp has promised reforms. He also has refused to
blame his predecessor, Samuel Pierce, who faces questioning before
Congress next month.
   Turner was arrested Tuesday and pleaded innocent before U.S.
Magistrate Donald Abram. He was released on $100,000 bond.
   The case is scheduled to be heard by Nov. 7 by U.S. District
Judge Jim R. Carrigan, who also is presiding over a civil case
against Turner.
   The civil lawsuit was filed by Norton's office Aug. 8, and seeks
to recover the allegedly embezzled funds. Turner, who was suspended
without pay June 4, and fired Aug. 8, was expected to respond to the
civil lawsuit by Sept. 5.
   Turner is accused of embezzling $1,006,130 from Dec. 1 through
May 22. Norton said federal agents recovered more than $480,000 in
money, securities and property. Turner, whose annual salary was
$28,000, had been building a suburban home valued at $450,000 or
more, the prosecutor said.
   If convicted, Turner could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine on each of six counts.

   A jetliner returned safely to O'Hare International
Airport late Tuesday after the pilot reported an engine on fire
shortly after takeoff, officials said.
   The Royal Jordanian Airlines L-1011 left O'Hare on a flight to
Vienna, Austria, when the pilot reported a fire in one of the
aircraft's three engines, said Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   The fire went out while the plane was still airborne, Edelstein
said, but the pilot dumped fuel over Lake Michigan as a precaution
before landing.
   Emergency equipment was on standby, but the plane landed without
incident.
   ``No problems, no injuries,'' said Edelstein.
   The number of people on board was not available.
   In another incident at O'Hare, an American Airlines Boeing 727
returned to the airport when one of its three engines was shut down
after taking off Tuesday afternoon for Rochester, Minn.
   Flight 993 was aborted when the pilot experienced vibrations in
the tail engine, said Edelstein. The plane landed safely.

Triton _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have
been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the
spacecraft's cameras, NASA says.
   ``It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said Rich Terrile,
an astronomer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It would have been an incredible
disappointment.''
   ``They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist

   U.S. policy toward Panama enters an uncertain
phase Friday when the calendar runs out on the ousted president's
term, leaving the United States with nobody to recognize as legal
head of the country.
   The situation raises a number of touchy situations, such as
notifying Panamanian officials when a U.S. naval vessel plans to
search a Panamanian-flag ship suspected of carrying drugs.
   Panama's President Eric Arturo Delvalle was ousted in February
1988 by forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The Reagan
administration refused to recognize that ouster, and the United
States has continued to look upon Delvalle as Panama's legal
authority even though he wields no power.
   But Friday is the date when Delvalle was supposed to step down
officially as president, according to Panama's constitution. With
that date, the Bush administration's withdraws the mantle of
legitimacy it accorded to Delvalle.

   At a funeral for slain Black Panther
co-founder Huey Newton, friends called his death a ``clarion call''
to free black communities of drug-related violence and mourners
chanted ``Free Huey,'' a reminder of an earlier period of militancy.
   ``His problem with chemical dependency represents all our
weaknesses in America,'' said Newton's friend and fellow Panther
David Hilliard during the service Monday.
   Among the 1,200 people attending the service at the Allen Temple
Baptist Church were H. Rap Brown, leader of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee, and Panther co-founder Bobby Seale. Hundreds
of others milled around in the streets outside.
   Newton, 47, was killed early Aug. 22 in the poor West Oakland
neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years
ago. Police said Newton died in a dispute over crack cocaine.

<HEAD>The Nashville Network: Twang With the Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Programs on The Nashville Network may
look like ``The Tonight Show'' and ``Entertainment Tonight,'' but
there's a twang with the talk on this ambitious channel.
   TNN, an upstart 6-year-old cable station, is using guitars,
fiddles and fringe as keystones of programming that highlights
country music.
   The toe-tapping sounds and a potpourri of other shows are aimed
at the American heartland by TNN, a cousin to the cornpone show
``Hee Haw'' in the Gaylord Broadcasting corporate umbrella.
   ``Our target audience is you and me,'' said general manager David
Hall. ``We own a home, have cars, have kids. Our audience is
America.''
   Since 1983, TNN has brought a flavor to the screen that
distinguishes it from its cable comrades.
   On ESPN, you see football helmets; it's cowboy hats on TNN.
   HBO has movies, but TNN has the legendary Grand Ole Opry.
   MTV offers screeching electric guitars, but TNN's music is
wrenching country weepers about heartache and roaming romance.
   ``Our mission is to be the No. 1 source for country music
entertainment and information,'' said Hall, who swept floors at the
Opryland USA theme park while in high school.
   Some country music stars say TNN, which uses a guitar neck as its
logo, is indeed reaching a receptive middle American audience.
   Fiddler-guitarist Charlie Daniels observes, ``We were on the
`Tonight' show recently and I'll bet no more than six people
mentioned seeing us. But after we're on TNN, people everywhere come
up and say they saw us.''
   Says singer Randy Travis, ``TNN has taken country music to a lot
more people and I think that's good for us all.''
   ``Nashville Now,'' broadcast for 90 minutes each weeknight, is
TNN's answer to the ``Tonight'' show. It has music, talk, a live
studio audience and host Ralph Emery sitting behind a desk much like
Johnny Carson.
   It is TNN's most popular weeknight show, seen by up to 750,000
households.
   TNN's ``Crook and Chase'' is similar to ``Entertainment Tonight''
except there's a live studio audience and emphasis on country music
performers, who often appear to talk with the hosts.
   The network, available to about 46 million households on cable
systems across the country, hasn't restricted itself to rhinestones
to attract viewers. It has drawn on some prominent non-country
celebrities in an effort to widen its audience.
   Dinah Shore has a talk show. John Davidson and Florence Henderson
star on cooking shows. Wolfman Jack is host of a rock 'n' roll
oldies show. Kent McCord and Martin Milner, who formerly starred in
``Adam 12,'' have reunited in a two-hour movie for TNN to be aired
later this year.
   ``If you can find stars who don't offend your core of support and
might broaden your appeal, you try to do that,'' Hall said. ``You
bring them in to open things up and give people a sample and they
find that country music is very enjoyable.''
   Other programming includes country music videos, western movies,
concerts, rodeos, stock car racing features, fishing, remodeling,
gardening, motor home use and a talent show resembling ``Star
Search.''
   TNN was started by WSM, Inc., the same broadcasting company that
launched the Grand Ole Opry radio show in 1925. Gaylord bought the
Opry, TNN, Opryland and related properties in 1983.
   The Opry music show is broadcast on the network for 30 minutes
every Saturday night. Another half-hour is devoted to backstage
interviews.
   ``If you're a country music fan and you have the chance to watch
the Opry at home on a Saturday night, you do it,'' Hall said.
   TNN is privately held and doesn't release how much money the
network makes.
   According to Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a Carmel, Calif.,
consulting company, TNN has made a financial recovery since a loss
of $6 million in 1985. The network has made money every year since
and is expected to earn $25 million this year after taxes, the
consultant said.
   There are shortfalls in the country's two biggest markets. TNN is
not available in parts of New York City and has to share a channel
in Los Angeles.
   Still, TNN says it penetrates 50 percent of American TV homes and
90 percent of all cable TV homes.
   Says Hall, ``For a 6-year-old cable TV network to reach 50
percent in such a short span of time and continue to grow at a
dramatic pace is remarkable.''

   If you would like a grand tour of some of the
most treasured assets of American industry, just take a stroll
through the aisles of your local supermarket.
   The soups, cereals, pet foods and frozen entrees come in packages
of many colors. But to the businesses that produce them, many are
solid gold.
   To get a financial slant on the modern food-processing industry,
consider how it has fared on Wall Street in the 1980s.
   The Value Line Investment Survey, the nation's largest investment
advisory service, notes that stocks of food manufacturers, which
have soared this year even faster than the market as a whole, are on
the way to their ninth straight year of ``outperforming'' the market
averages.
   ``In the 1980s, an investor could not have found a much more
fertile investment field,'' Value Line observed.
   That message hasn't gone unnoticed by the takeover artists and
speculators of Wall Street, who have made the food stocks one of
their most regular haunts. What attracts them is not only abundant
sales and profits, but the perception of precious assets waiting to
be mined.
   ``The most valuable asset of the typical leading food processor
can't even be found on its balance sheet,'' Value Line says.
   ``That asset is the portfolio of brand-name franchises. The buyer
is willing to pay a premium price for these names. That translates
into premium profits.''
   For a time during the 1960s and '70s, it looked as though the Big
Brand Name was a diminishing species in food and other
consumer-products businesses.
   The increasingly sophisticated shopper was discovering that a lot
of money could be saved by opting for a store's private label
merchandise or for ``generic'' goods in austere packages.
   But in the 1980s, hurried consumers looking for convenience and
reliability have evidently gone back to the names they know best.
   As a result, says Value Line, there is an unprecedented array
these days of powerful brand names in the nation's stores.
Food-processing companies are spending more and more of each sales
dollar on advertising and expanding old brand names and trying to
develop new ones.
   All this can have a self-reinforcing effect. When a brand attains
high status, the large sales volume that results often allows the
product to be made, packaged and sold at a lower cost per unit.
   At the same time, supermarkets and other retailers tend to give
more coveted shelf space to big-name brands. More shelf space, in
turn, contributes to still-higher sales.
   That is not to say, by any means, that this process happens
automatically. Armies of people are employed to nurture, protect and
promote packaged-food products and their names.
   Just imagine, for example, all the work that has gone n the past
few years into ``positioning'' existing food products and creating
new ones to meet changing consumer health concerns.
   When any business has been prospering for a long time, people
naturally begin to wonder if some lean years aren't due pretty soon.
But the way analysts see things now, prospects for food producers
and their big brands still look bright.
   The recession scare of the past few months has eased of late.
Even if a downturn comes, the food industry is historically
recession-resistant.
   At the investment firm of Merrill Lynch, which is projecting a
``mild, short-lived recession'' that might drag down profits
somewhat in more cyclical industries, analysts say, ``the earnings
reports of many food companies should sparkle against that dull
background.''

<HEAD>Church Labor Day Message Sees Unions As Bracing Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor unions, resented by totalitarian states and
sometimes by corporate managers, are regarded by most historic
churches as buttressing the rights and dignity of ordinary workers.
   Their entitlement to organize and negotiate contractual standards
also have become protected by law in democratic countries.
   That point was underlined in the 1989 Labor Day message of the
U.S. Catholic Conference. It cited a particularly dramatic modern
example _ the union-spawned turn to democracy in Poland.
   Similar union-backed thrusts for democracy were noted in other
long-oppressive lands, sometimes meeting countermeasures. Some
anti-union moves also were seen in this country.
   Americans ``can now see how trade unions in Eastern Europe,
Africa and Asia unite and uplift the aspirations for freedom and
solidarity of oppressed peoples,'' the message said.
   Called ``Freedom, Justice and the Role of Unions,'' the statement
pointed up the union-energized dawn of fuller rights in Poland, long
under communist oppression, and said:
   ``All men and women of good will are heartened by the successful
struggle of Poland's workers, whose free, democratic trade union,
`Solidarnosc' (Solidarity) has become the instrument of progress,
and we hope, liberation. ...
   ``Working people in Hungary, in China, in South Africa and in
Siberia and the Ukraine are asserting the same social values of
human dignity, freedom and solidarity ... as they work ... to create
the democratic trade unions. ...''
   Christianity and Judaism have special grounds for concern with
the labor movement drawn from the Bible and its emphasis on mutual
community responsibility for all persons in it, including its
lowliest workers.
   ``We are members one of another,'' the apostle Paul wrote,
stressing the duty of all to share the burdens and needs of fellow
toilers, and also to uphold and celebrate their well-being.
   A tentmaker himself, as well as evangelist, he saw work as
honorable and essential, a part of God's unfolding creation. ``We
are coworkers with God.'' Sloth, termed by the church one of seven
deadly sins, also drew Paul's scorn, ``Let him who won't work not
eat.''
   Major churches in this century have voiced their support for
union organization and collective bargaining to set standards for
workers.
   The ``important social contributions of the labor movement'' has
been recognized ``by almost every branch of the Christian church,''
says the National Council of Churches, including most Protestant and
Eastern Orthodox denominations.
   However, labor had a long and often difficult struggle in its
early years, sometimes marked by violence on both sides, as in
efforts of coal miners led by the late John L. Lewis to gain
contractual standards.
   But the upheavals of the Depression in the l930's and ensuing
government reforms shored up legal rights of workers to organize and
negotiate with their companies for basic conditions and wages.
   While strains and antagonism sometimes arise in the process, many
company managements have come to appreciate the mutual stability and
atmosphere of equity that labor agreements establish.
   However, the Catholic Labor Day message, while citing the
union-backed gains for democracy abroad, says that ``in the United
States, ironically workers are measurably worse off than they were
10 years ago.
   ``Structural changes in the economy, increased reliance on
imports, union-breaking efforts, and a growing shift to lower-paid,
part-time employment have left millions of Americans without the
protection of unions.
   ``For many, this has meant lower living standards, no health
benefits and less security for their families.''
   The Catholic Labor Day message, issued by Auxiliary Bishop Joseph
M. Sullivan of Brooklyn, chairman of the U.S. Catholic Conference
committee on domestic policy, said:
   ``A strong trade union movement, with widespread collective
bargaining, can strengthen all of society. ... Union workers also
are more likely to have a voice in workplace decisions and local
affairs.
   ``Strong democratic unions can be a training ground for community
leaders. That is one reason unions have been resisted by
totalitarian regimes and why they should be fostered in democratic
societies.''
   Declaring that ``social solidarity and the bonds of community are
weakened when the spirit of individualism triumphs over
communitarian values,'' the statement said:
   ``Workers ... have a duty to use their unions not only for their
own self-interest, but also for the good of the whole society. This
flows from the fact that work is a vocation, a calling by God to
participate in his creation. ...
   ``Since unions can only fulfill their important functions for
their members and for society when there is full participation, it
is important for workers to take their social obligations seriously
and to use well their opportunity for union membership.''

   Alaska's vast wilds challenge commonly held
notions about wilderness management. In the Brooks Range, officials
weigh the rule book against the rights of natives who obey an older
mandate: follow the caribou. This is the second story in a four-part
series, American Wilderness.

<DATELINE>GATES OF THE ARCTIC NATIONAL PARK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is the
nation's premier wilderness park, cherished by seekers of solitude
and protected by law from degradation, a soul-stirring expanse of
rugged mountains, icy rivers, caribou and grizzly bears.
   But something is wrong with this picture. All-terrain vehicles
are rumbling across the tundra, and park officials entrusted to
guard the land propose removing 75,000 acres from wilderness status,
the largest deletion in the history of the national wilderness
preservation system.
   What's going on here?
   The answer involves a concept of wilderness different from
anything found in the lower 48 states. It involves a struggle to
balance the value of Alaska's wild land against the rights of humans
who still live in it.
   Most of all, it involves people like Joby Ahgook, a Nunamiut
Eskimo who lives in a little village high in the Brooks Range,
bounded on three sides by the park.
   ``Years ago, when people settled here, they followed the
caribou,'' Ahgook said the other day as he and his family bounced
across the tundra in an eight-wheeled ATV. ``We're still following
the caribou. I want to continue to hunt, even if this is a park.
This is very important to my family, and their families to be.''
   Ahgook's village is called Anaktuvuk Pass, after a native word
meaning ``place of caribou droppings.'' It is an odd name only to
outsiders. Caribou has been the Nunamiuts' staff of life for
generations. Their grandparents ate caribou meat fresh and dried.
They walked in caribou-skin shoes, lived in caribou-skin tents, and
slept in caribou-skin blankets.
   Like the animals they hunted, the Nunamiut were nomads. Each
spring and fall, they walked into the mountains to intercept caribou
migrating through the passes. In summer, they headed north to trade
with coastal Eskimos.
   This is not ancient history. The Nunamiut had no permanent
settlement until the late 1940s. By 1960, they still lived in sod
huts.
   A few huts remain, but most residents now live in well-insulated
prefab houses. The huskies that hunters once used as pack dogs have
been replaced by snowmobiles and Argos, big ATVs with six or eight
low-pressure tires.
   But the Nunamiut still lead a harsh existence. No roads connect
Anaktuvuk Pass to the outside world. When the winter sun barely
sneaks over the mountains, temperatures can sink to 60 below for
days.
   Food and fuel are outrageously expensive, since everything must
be flown in. So residents still depend on caribou for much of their
diet. Antlers adorn roofs all over town, and skins hang drying on
porch rails.
   It's the kind of life that makes you want to cut these people
some slack _ and that is just what Congress did in 1980 when it
passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
   The act set aside more than 100 million acres of Alaska in
national parks, preserves, forests and wildlife refuges. Within
these areas, it designated 56 million acres as wilderness, more than
doubling the size of the national wilderness system.
   Gates of the Arctic's 7 million acres of wilderness, together
with 5.8 million acres next door in the Noatak National Preserve,
comprise the nation's largest stretch of unbroken wilderness.
   Vast as it is, Alaska's wilderness is not as pure in definition
as the lower 48 variety. Congress compromised some traditional
wilderness restrictions out of concern for rural Alaskans like the
Nunamiut _ who, it was argued, were as much a part of the wilderness
as the caribou.
   While motorized travel is strictly prohibited in most lower 48
wilderness areas, Alaska's wilderness system allows snowmobiles,
motorboats and airplanes.
   Anaktuvuk Pass residents supported creation of the park around
them because they thought it would keep out sport hunters while
allowing them to continue their subsistence hunt of caribou. But
they bridled at unexpected park regulations.
   The biggest fight has been over ATVs, one of the few forms of
mechanized transportation prohibited by the lands act. Anaktuvuk
Pass hunters argue the ATVs are essential for summer trips.
   ATVs leave tracks in the fragile tundra, sometimes digging deep
ruts into wet ground. While long-term damage to vegetation has not
been proved, tracks often can be seen for years afterward,
detracting from the ``ultimate wilderness experience'' that the park
strives to give the 2,000 or so visitors who fly in each year.
   A 1983 agreement established a narrow ATV corridor from Anaktuvuk
Pass to a popular lake. But that proved too limiting, and in 1986,
the park service gave villagers temporary permission to continue
what they had been doing illegally all along: following the caribou,
even if it meant driving across wilderness.
   Local park officials, meanwhile, worked out a complicated deal
with the natives that both sides feel addresses most of the problems.
   The park service would de-authorize 75,000 acres of wilderness
near the village and allow the natives ``wandering rights'' over
159,000 additional acres of park land. In exchange, 18,000 acres
elsewhere in the park would be designated wilderness, and the
natives would give up development rights on 93,000 acres of their
own land.
   ``I think it's a reasonably fair exchange of interests,'' says
park superintendent Roger Siglin. ``It definitely compromises
wilderness. But it's also a significant compromise on the part of
the natives involved.''
   Siglin still has to sell the idea to his superiors, the public
and Congress. Only Congress can de-authorize wilderness, something
that's been done just twice before, for minor adjustments to
wilderness areas in Vermont and Florida.
   Environmentalists want to see a draft environmental impact
statement, due out this winter, before responding formally. But they
express sympathy for the Nunamiut.
   ``I don't consider taking wilderness out of the preservation
system very lightly, no matter what the circumstances are,'' says
Allen E. Smith, Alaska regional director of the Wilderness Society.
But, he adds, ``the reality is there has to be some give. There is a
legitimate problem here that has to be fixed.''
   Siglin says he believes the compromise will win approval, ``if
only because I don't think anybody else has a better idea.''
   Joby Ahgook hopes that Siglin is right. When Ahgook was 10, he
walked behind his father on hunting forays into the mounains. Now,
at age 40, he loads his own five children into an ATV for hunting
trips. The mechanism is different, but the point is the same: follow
the caribou.
   Indeed, as he maneuvers the noisy ATV across the tundra, he seems
to have some wandering caribou spirit in him. He sweeps his hand,
encompassing a dozen mountain peaks flanking the pass.
   ``We go way past those mountains in these machines,'' he shouts
over the roar of the engine. ``It's great. We go all over.''
   Wherever you want?
   ``Yeah,'' the son of nomads says, smiling broadly. ``Wherever we
want.''

   Trying to escape society's rules? A wilderness
trip might not help. Overcrowding has led to strict limits on
visitors in many areas. This story, the third in a four-part series,
American Wilderness, examines how rangers are keeping one place from
being loved to death.

   These sparkling alpine lakes live
up to their name. Hikers often say they half-expect to see an elf
behind the next granite boulder or a gnome crouched under a lakeside
larch.
   Wilderness ranger Elizabeth Goulet knows better. There is more
likely to be another hiker behind that boulder, she says, and a
trash pile under the tree.
   At the moment she's inspecting one careless camper's jetsam: 10
freeze-dried meal wrappers, a penlight battery, a jar of instant
coffee, an empty sardine can, a campstove burner and a tube of bug
repellent.
   Usually Goulet would be fuming, but today she's all smiles. The
litterer also discarded an envelope with his name on it, so a Mr.
Martinez soon will be getting a package in the mail. His own trash.
Sent C.O.D.
   Rangers here in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness of the Cascade Range
savor such moments as they try to keep visitors from loving the
wilderness to death. Most are more considerate than Martinez, but
sheer numbers take their toll.
   ``It's becoming almost what we call urban wilderness,'' Goulet
says. ``We manage it so much for people that we sometimes lose sight
of managing it for its wilderness value.''
   The U.S. Forest Service, which administers this wilderness area,
has resorted to an entry permit system to limit the number of
campers in the Enchantments.
   It's part of a growing trend. National parks, where the focus is
on accommodating visitors, have struggled for years with the balance
between letting sight-seers in and maintaining a place worth seeing.
But wilderness areas, traditionally less used and less intensively
managed, are catching up fast.
   A Colorado State University survey found that 28 percent of the
nation's 474 wilderness areas now limit recreational use with
methods such as entry permits or restrictions on stay length or
camping. Still more are considering such moves. The survey said
recreational use is increasing or stable in all but 3 percent of the
wilderness areas.
   In Washington, the fast-growing Seattle area promises more
pressure on the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, which already sees more
visitors annually than Mount Rainier National Park.
   ``We have a very high outdoor ethic,'' says Forest Service
spokesman Ron DeHart in Seattle. ``People want to do more than look
at the mountains. They want to get out in them.''
   Many choose to do it in the Enchantment Lakes, which occupy a
small corner of the 306,000-acre Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Here, a
dozen crystalline lakes sit in a basin of glacier-scoured granite,
all hemmed in by jagged peaks. The basin's lower reach features
trees gnarled by the elements, meadows of heather, and tarns with
names like Talisman and Leprechaun. The upper basin is starker, a
haunting landscape of rock and snow.
   No one knows the area better than Bill Stark, 78, and his wife,
Peggy, 72. They named many of the lakes and have made a pilgrimage
here every year since 1959 from their home in nearby Leavenworth.
   ``When we first went up, it looked like nobody had ever been
there,'' Bill Stark says. ``Then we started seeing subtle signs of
use. Then not-so-subtle signs.''
   Hikers trampled a growing network of trails across the basin.
Lush beds of heather became matted down, and wads of toilet paper
blossomed everywhere. ``People are pigs,'' Stark says.
   By the late 1970s, a summer weekend could see 300 people in the
basin, creating a less-than-enchanting situation for everyone.
   The Forest Service tried to minimize damage. Toilets were
installed in 1966. The use of horses was restricted in 1972. Guided
groups were banned in 1976. And dogs, which chase wildlife and
disturb other campers, were prohibited in 1982.
   The permit system was established in 1987, limiting the number of
campers to about 60 on any given day. The permit period runs from
June 15 to Oct. 15, and popular summer weekends are booked solid
within a few weeks after permit applications are accepted March 1.
   The permits detract from one value of wilderness: the opportunity
to escape society's regimentation.
   ``Wilderness implies freedom, and you can't get that freedom with
the permit system,'' Goulet concedes. ``But you couldn't get it here
anyway, because without the permits, there would be crowds of
people.''
   A few campers each week sneak in without permits, risking a $50
fine from one of the five rangers patrolling the Enchantments. But
most visitors seem to respect the aim of the permit system.
   ``This is a really special place. Whatever it takes to keep it
special is worth it,'' says hiker Hal Zimmer, 39, on his seventh
trip to the Enchantments.
   The permits are inconvenient, says hiker Jeff Merkel of
Philadelphia. His partner waited in line two hours at the
Leavenworth ranger station for one of the limited number of permits
reserved for ``walk-in'' business.
   But Merkel doesn't mind, considering the alternative: ``There
would be people all around the place. You might as well be at the
Jersey shore.''
   The permit system is working, Goulet says. The crowds are gone,
giving rangers a chance to start replanting some eroded, overused
campsites.
   It is still not Goulet's idea of true wilderness.
   ``The ultimate wilderness would be taking an unaffected area and
blocking it off to everybody,'' she says. ``I wouldn't have to go
see it. Just knowing it was there would be enough, knowing that
there's an area we haven't messed up.''
   But there is also value to an ``urban wilderness'' like the
Enchanted Lakes, she says, ``a place where people can sense what the
land was like before we got here.''
   It gives people a taste of nature, and if it is not totally wild,
visitors can at least make believe.

   Once they bought out a New York real estate
company. Once they pretended to be developers in Virginia. As the
folks at The Nature Conservancy have shown time and again, there's
more than one way to preserve wild lands. This is the last part of a
series, American Wilderness.

   While environmental groups have
battled government and development interests during the 25 years of
the Wilderness Act, a little-known private group has quietly put
aside nearly 4 million acres of ecologically important lands.
   In its 38 years, The Nature Conservancy has saved threatened
lands ranging from 343 square miles of rare New Mexican desert
grassland to a heron feeding ground on nine-tenths of an acre of
Connecticut marsh.
   And with a well-endowed war chest and a proven track record, the
Arlington, Va.-based, non-profit group now saves land at an average
of a thousand acres a day.
   The Conservancy's success is due in part to an organizational
credo. It will not fight developers in court nor seek a public forum
to save private land. It remains neutral in skirmishes involving
government, environmentalists and business interests, using a
checkbook and persuasion rather than lawyers and protests.
   ``We used to describe ourselves as the real estate arm of the
conservation movement,'' said Bill Weeks, the Conservancy's chief
operating officer. ``That role has been changing, but we still will
look to market-based solutions rather than regulatory solutions.''
   The Conservancy's proven techniques and changing role are evident
here in the Carrizo Plain, 180,000 acres of beautifully empty
grasslands 150 miles north of Los Angeles.
   Home to endangered species like the kit fox and blunt-nosed
lizard, the Carrizo was purchased after the Conservancy put together
such unlikely partners as state and federal agencies, the oil
industry, ranching interests and conservation groups.
   The Conservancy is involved in a new ambitious project to
re-introduce native grasses, elk and antelope, lost to farming and
cattle grazing.
   ``Grazing ended this April and the native grass is already coming
up,'' preserve manager Chuck Warner said, standing in an emerald
green island of native rye grass surrounded by the dusty brown,
lunar landscape.
   Nearly half the land acquired by The Nature Conservancy comes
through standard real estate deals. While much, including the
Carrizo, is turned over to state or federal stewardship, the
Conservancy owns and manages the world's largest private nature
preserve system with nearly 1,000 preserves.
   Other land targeted by the Conservancy is protected through
conservation easements and other agreements with landowners around
the country.
   ``They have done a superb job over the years,'' said Charles
Miller, a National Wildlife Federation spokesman. ``There is
sometimes a lot of controversy within the conservation community
over which way to proceed in an issue, but The Nature Conservancy
just goes in its own direction and does something that is a
fantastic service.''
   The organization began in 1946 when a special committee of the
Ecological Society of America split off to form the Ecologist's
Union, renamed The Nature Conservancy in 1951.
   In the early days, the group's main goal was to take undisturbed
lands out of circulation. Its first purchases were financed by
mortgages on the homes of members.
   Since then, the group has parlayed donations, grants and business
acumen into an $85 million fund and a national organization with
540,000 members staffed by more than 1,000 part-and full-time
organizers and naturalists.
   The Conservancy finds land to protect through its Natural
Heritage Program, a joint venture with state governments to
inventory and save the habitats of endangered plants and animals.
   ``We look for habitats or ecosystems that are particularly
threatened,'' said Steve McCormick, director of the California
Nature Conservancy. ``If you wait until a species is on the
endangered list, that usually means its habitat is gone.''
   Deals can be complicated. To save a Long Island osprey nesting
ground, the New York chapter had to purchase an entire real estate
company, complete with Manhattan brownstones and Florida warehouses.
   When the owner of a Virginia barrier island wanted his land
developed instead of conserved, the Conservancy purchased it through
a dummy development company.
   ``It created some public-relations problems with the people here
because they felt we were sneaky,'' said Barry Truitt, manager of
the Conservancy's Virginia Coast Preserve. ``We didn't use any
tactics that aren't used by developers, but I guess because we're
conservationists, they expect our standards to be higher.''
   Some land is donated. Bob Butler, a Kennebunk, Maine, furniture
store owner gave the Conservancy a 12-acre parcel along the
Kennebuck River.
   ``I didn't want it ever to be developed, but then someone offered
me a deal I could barely refuse,'' he said. ``I gave it up so I
wouldn't be tempted again.''
   Butler was so impressed with the Conservancy that he went on to
serve as a chairman its Maine board of trustees.
   The Conservancy offers other deals. It will take land in exchange
for low interest loans, other properties and lifetime annuities. It
will pay for conservation easements to keep land out of development.
   It also sponsors a landowner notification program to tell people
how to protect endangered species on their property.
   ``Landowners usually are surprised and delighted that they have
something rare on their land and they become advocates,'' said
McCormick.
   The Conservancy's non-confrontational stance has put it
increasingly in the role of mediator, as when local officials and
developers battled conservationists and government agencies over the
habitat of the Coachella fringe-toed lizard, a tiny reptile that
only survives in the special sands of the Coachella Valley in the
hot real estate market around Palm Springs.
   After months of negotiations, and $2 million in Conservancy seed
money, the parties agreed to a 13,000-acre preserve. Developers will
pay a $600 mitigation fee for each acre of lizard habitat that is
developed outside the preserve.
   Paul Selzer, a attorney for some developers, said the Conservancy
was able to show that setting the land aside served everyone's
interest.
   ``Another environmental group in the process could have made it
more difficult,'' he said.
   McCormick said the bitter controversy was eased when developers
saw their holdings would be enhanced by the preserve.
   ``Attitudes change,'' he said. ``The developers thought of
environmentalists as people with a weird interest in a strange
animal. Now they see it as a question of quality of life.''
   In addition to the role as mediator, the Conservancy has become
more involved in restoration. At its Blowing Rocks Preserve on
Florida's Jupiter Island, ``exotics,'' non-native trees like the
Australian pine and Brazilian Pepper, have been cut to halt their
encroachment on indigenous species and the fragile dune ecology.
   ``It's become clearer that not only species but whole biological
systems are threatened,'' Weeks said.
   The Conservancy is taking greater steps to protect those systems
through agreements that limit the use of adjacent lands. At the
Virginia Coast Preserve, the Conservancy has negotiated with
neighboring landowners to control development pressures on the
fringes of the preserve.
   ``We once thought we were going to be establishing nature
preserves that would exist apart from society,'' said Weeks. ``Now
we've come to feel the integration of these nature preserves with
the fabric of the society around them is critical.''

<TEXT>
   The governing National Party
and the militants who seek to oust it agree on one momentous aspect
of South Africa's parliamentary elections: They they may well be the
last that exclude the nation's black majority.
   If Nationalists emerge with their power intact from the balloting
this coming Wednesday, overcoming unparalleled challenges from white
opposition parties on the left and far right, they will have a
mandate for their pledge to bring blacks into the political system
on a limited basis by the end of the new Parliament's five-year term.
   Anti-apartheid activists say the Nationalists' promise is vague,
however, and hope to force the government to the bargaining table
within a much shorter period to arrange for a one-person, one-vote
system.
   The activists have conducted a nationwide civil disobedience
campaign to coincide with the campaign and have urged mixed-race and
Indian voters to boycott the elections for Parliament's two separate
junior chambers, the 80-seat body for mixed-race representatives and
the 40-seat chamber for Indians.
   ``The racist elections will not determine our future,'' said Jay
Naidoo, general-secretary of the militant Congress of South African
Trade Unions. ``We will determine our own future.''
   The man who will decide how to confront this spirit of resistance
is almost certain to be F.W. de Klerk, the National Party leader who
became acting president Aug. 15 after P.W. Botha's forced
resignation. If his party retains control of Parliament's dominant
white chamber, the 53-year-old Klerk will be elected for a five-year
term as president.
   De Klerk's immediate challenge is to ensure that his party
survives its toughest electoral threat since taking power in 1948.
Several polls have suggested the possibility of a ``hung
Parliament,'' with the far-right Conservative Party and liberal
Democratic Party each gaining enough seats to deprive the
Nationalists of an outright majority.
   In the outgoing Parliament, the National Party controls 123 of
the 166 elected seats in the white chamber, the Conservatives 22 and
the Democrats 20. One seat is held by a member of a now-defunct
moderate party.
   In the most recent white election, in 1987, the Nationalists won
about 52 percent of the vote, right-wing candidates 30 percent and
liberals 18 percent. According to polls, the National Party is
virtually certain to get less than half the white votes this time,
although it could maintain control of Parliament even if its share
of votes drops toward 40 percent.
   A poll commissioned in late July by the country's largest
newspaper, The Sunday Times, suggested the Nationalists could be
reduced to 78 seats, with Conservatives winning 52 and the Democrats
36. A party needs 84 seats to rule on its own.
   One of de Klerk's deputies, Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen,
said the Nationalists would prefer calling another election, rather
than govern in a coalition with either rival party.
   ``We will go back to the voters and say make up your mind,''
Viljoen said. ``If you don't want us, rather kick us out and choose
a single, strong government.''
   No polls are allowed in the final four weeks before a national
election in South Africa, and thus there have been few means of
measuring the political impact of Botha's bitter resignation. Botha
objected to de Klerk's plans to confer with President Kenneth Kaunda
of Zambia, one of black Africa's most vocal critics of apartheid.
   Initially, commentators said the showdown would help the
Conservative Party, which shared Botha's objections to the de
Klerk-Kaunda meeting. But National Party officials say de Klerk had
proved his mettle and held to his commitment to pursue dialogue even
with opponents.
   In contrast to the tempermental Botha, de Klerk is viewed as a
personable pragmatist who will work energetically to lessen South
Africa's international isolation. He is likely to benefit from the
impending independence of Namibia after 74 years years of South
African rule and the increasing tendency of southern African leaders
to favor negotiation over confrontation.
   But both white opposition parties have assailed de Klerk and his
party on grounds that they are attempting to straddle difficult
domestic issues with ambiguous, evasive positions.
   Asked whether a black could become president, for example, the
Conservatives say no and the Democrats say yes. The Nationalists
duck the question.
   Similarly, de Klerk's declarations that he opposes discrimination
have been undercut by harsh police crackdowns on black activists
defying segregation laws on whites-only beaches and buses.
   The country's myriad economic problems also have provided
ammunition for the opposition parties. Many whites feel they are
fighting a losing battle against high taxes and inflation, and a
series of corruption cases involving Nationalist politicians has
served to heighten the anger.
   ``Forty-one years is long enough,'' said Denis Worrall, a former
ambassador to Britain who is one of the Democrats' three co-leaders.
``Only a new party, untainted by apartheid and economic failure,
will inspire the confidence internationally to turn this country
around.''
   The Conservative Party says de Klerk's five-year plan will lead
inevitably to black majority rule and hopes to score major gains in
rural and blue-collar districts with its call for stricter
segregation. It has boasted of surmounting black consumer boycotts
that were launched to protest the reintroduction of hardline
segregation laws by Conservative-controlled councils in the
industrial city of Boksburg and the mining town of Carletonville.
   ``The white community's right to self-determination is
non-negotiable,'' says the Conservatives' manifesto.
   But Nationalist leaders believe their policies accurately reflect
the sentiments of most of South Africa's 5 million whites. While the
whites generally want to ease racial tensions and win black
cooperation, they also want to protect white power and white
privileges, including segregated neighborhoods and schools.
   ``The Conservative Party tries to cling to white domination, and
this will never be acceptable to people of color,'' de Klerk said in
a recent speech. ``The Democratic Party's proposals will lead to the
usurping of power (by blacks) and this will never be acceptable to
the whites.''

   Some facts and figures on South
Africa's election for a new Parliament:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHAT'S AT STAKE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A total of 763 candidates are contesting 166 seats in
Parliament's dominant white chamber, 80 seats in the chamber for
people of mixed-race and 40 seats in the chamber for Indians. The
two junior chambers have no power to overrule the white chamber on
matters of national policy.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHO CAN VOTE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   According to government figures, 3,170,667 of the country's 5
million whites are eligble to vote, as are 1,775,751 of about 3
million mixed-race people and 665,870 of the roughly 1 million
Indians.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHO CAN'T VOTE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   None of South Africa's 28 million blacks are allowed to vote in
national elections. They can vote only for municipal officials and
for the administrations of the country's 10 tribal homelands.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE KEY COMPETITORS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Because the Indian and mixed-race chambers of Parliament have
little power, most attention is focused on the whites' House of
Assembly, where the National Party holds 123 of the 166 elected
seats. It faces strong challenges from the far-right Conservative
Party, which holds 22 seats, and the anti-apartheid Democratic
Party, which controls 20 seats. One seat was held by a now-defunct
moderate party.
   The Conservatives favor a strengthening of segregation laws and
oppose political rights to blacks. The Democrats favor abolishing
all segregation laws and granting universal political rights, with
some provisions for ensuring that whites and other minority groups
have a voice in government decisions. The National Party has
proposed a five-year plan for bringing blacks into the political
system on a limited basis. It wants to ensure that blacks cannot
overrule white interests, and it wants to maintain segregated
schools and neighborhoods for whites who want them.

   When it was signed Sept. 3, 1964, the Wilderness
Act started a historic carving-up of federal land that continues
full bore today. In 25 years, America's wilderness system has grown
tenfold. How much more do we need? Contradictory answers are
examined by AP Northwest Regional Reporter David Foster in the first
story in a series, American Wilderness.

<TEXT>
   Not far from the gift shops and ski
chalets of this crowded resort, a little trail by a little creek
offers a way to the wild. Hike up the ridge, look to the east, and
all you see is nature. No roads, no vacation condos, just forested
valleys and the sky-scraping Pioneer Mountains.
   Lynne Stone wants to keep it that way.
   On a cloudless August day, she stands on the ridge and stares at
a rocky knob bristling with lodgepole pines. In this exaggerated
landscape, the hummock doesn't even rate a name on the map.
   ``A hill like this in Nebraska would be considered a national
park,'' Stone says and then suggests how nice it would be to spread
Idaho's beauty around. Give a mountain to Omaha, or a sparkling
stream to Newark. Of course you can't, she realizes: ``It's all in
Idaho. You have to protect it where it is.''
   And so she does, or at least she tries. The Pioneer Mountains are
among 4 million acres of Idaho's national forests that
conservationists like Stone want placed in the National Wilderness
Preservation System.
   They'd get a better reception in Newark. Here in Idaho, they are
opposed by loggers, miners, ranchers, and off-road vehicle users who
would face more regulations or complete loss of access to the land
if it is designated wilderness.
   This is the latest battle in a drawn-out war over America's
roadless public lands, a conflict set in motion 25 years ago by a
simple but far-reaching document called the Wilderness Act.
   When President Lyndon Johnson signed it Sept. 3, 1964, he
institutionalized a radical idea: Let us protect some lands just as
nature made them. They would be places, the act said, ``where the
earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man
himself is a visitor who does not remain.''
   Over the years, those tranquil places have seen a lot of
contention. Sagebrush rebels have bulldozed roads into pristine land
to spoil it for wilderness. ``Eco-terrorists'' have pounded spikes
into ancient trees to spoil them for logging.
   The law's silver anniversary is a time for preservationists to
celebrate _ since 1964 the national wilderness system has grown
tenfold to nearly 91 million acres. But it is also a time to take
stock. After 25 years, have we set aside all the wilderness we need?
Or does a growing populace in a polluted world require even more
wild space, for the sake of balance?
   ``We don't need any more designated wilderness,'' says John
Butterfield, snowmobiler and member of the Blue Ribbon Coalition,
which promotes multiple use of public lands. ``The land needs to be
managed, not set aside and forgotten.''
   ``I think there ought to be twice or maybe three times as much
land designated as wilderness,'' counters Gaylord Nelson, former
U.S. senator and now counselor to the Wilderness Society. ``There
are exceptional areas in practically every state that ought to be
left alone forever.''
   In the war over wilderness, balance is hard to find.
   Idaho's dark forests and high mountains fit the classic image of
wilderness. But around the nation the preservation system also
includes swamps, beaches, deserts and prairies; 474 areas in all,
ranging in size from Alaska's 8.7 million-acre Wrangell St. Elias
Wilderness to 3-acre Pelican Island, a haven for seabirds off the
Florida coast.
   Nearly two-thirds of the nation's wilderness is in Alaska, and
the West holds most of the other large chunks. But smaller areas are
scattered from sea to shining sea. All but six states _ Connecticut,
Rhode Island, Maryland, Delaware, Iowa and Kansas _ have some
designated wilderness.
   Covering 4 percent of the country, wilderness areas comprise a
sampler of the American landscape: Great Gulf and Lost Creek, Mud
Swamp and Thunder Ridge.
   If Fords Terror and Hell Hole Bay evoke the pioneers' image of
wilderness as a fearsome foe, then Shining Rock and Wonder Mountain
reflect a kinder view, a new land ethic lauding wilderness as a
connection to our roots and a source of national character.
   ``In wildness is the preservation of the world,'' Henry Thoreau
wrote in 1861. But it wasn't until 1924, when the U.S. Forest
Service set aside the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico, that Thoreau's
poetic words became public policy. And it took conservationists 40
more years to get what they really wanted: wilderness with the force
and permanence of law, shielded from bureaucratic whims.
   The 1964 Wilderness Act, enacted after eight years of debate and
66 versions, gave Congress the sole power to declare wilderness. In
wilderness, the law said, there would be no roads, no buildings, no
travel by mechanical means. Hunting, fishing and camping were
allowed, but commercial exploitation and development were generally
prohibited.
   Like Thoreau, the law was long on poetry. But it was short on
details, setting aside just 9.1 million acres of non-controversial
wilderness that had already been designated administratively. It
left the real battles to future sessions of Congress. Federal
agencies were instructed to study national park, forest and wildlife
refuge lands for wilderness suitability and make recommendations.
   The agencies lumbered about this gargantuan task for years, and
as recommendations started coming out in the 1970s, the designation
process gained speed. Since 1980 Congress has passed wilderness
bills for 31 states. This year it faces bills for 19 million acres
in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Idaho.
   Idaho's debate has been hot, persistent and in many ways typical.
This year there are two Idaho wilderness bills to choose from. One
is a conservationists' wish list for 4 million acres, introduced by
Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa. The other, more politically feasible
one, is a 1.4 million-acre bill sponsored by Idaho's senior senator,
Republican James McClure.
   Lynne Stone entered this fray as a volunteer soon after moving to
Ketchum, near Sun Valley, in 1981. Now she calls herself a ``working
conservationist,'' scraping by with seasonal government work or
grants from environmental groups. Last year she flew to Washington
for a stab at lobbying. She says she'd rather stay in the mountains.
   To be sure, that's where she seems most comfortable. At 41, she
strides up the steep trail with ease, narrating natural history as
she goes. She stops to inspect an elk track, then reels off the
names of plants anchored in the dry mountain soil: sage and sego
lilies, colorful cinquefoils, an ancient whitebark pine with gnarled
branches scratching like claws at the sky.
   Pretty, yes, but the wilderness is good for more than scenery,
she says. Wild plants and animals contribute to biological diversity
and maintain a stock of wild genes for future scientists, who might
just discover that something growing here cures cancer. Wilderness
also protects watersheds and contributes to clean air, Stone says.
   Such arguments are familiar to Joe Hinson of the Intermountain
Forestry Industry Association, which opposes both Idaho wilderness
bills.
   ``Every time there's a wilderness bill, somebody gets up and
says, `This completes the wilderness system,''' Hinson says. ``Five
years later, they're at it again. As long as an area doesn't have a
road in it, you're going to have a debate over it.''

   Some wilderness is fine, Hinson says, but you have to stop
somewhere, or at least guarantee some areas for development while
you're locking up others. Idaho, he points out, already has 4
million acres of wilderness _ 7.6 percent of the state.
   Others charge that environmentalists aren't as interested in
biological diversity as they are in creating elitist playgrounds for
wealthy, urban backpackers _ at the expense of local residents
trying to make a living off the public land.
   ``These lands belong to the people. That means all the people,
not a chosen few,'' says Butterfield of the Blue Ribbon Coalition.
   Lynne Stone, raised on an eastern Oregon ranch, says she's no
yuppie backpacker. And there are more ways to make a living off the
land, she adds, than by logging or mining it. Tourism is one of
Idaho's biggest industries, she says, and it's hard to lure tourists
to a clearcut.
   In 20 years, roads have been pushed through more than 8 million
acres of Idaho's wild country, according to the Idaho Conservation
League. ``We're destroying everything that isn't protected,'' Stone
says. ``If we don't set it aside, we'll lose it.''
   Both sides have strong arguments strongly stated _ if not
overstated. In virtually every wilderness debate, we're told the
area in question is a ``crown jewel'' of America's wildlands, to be
saved at all costs. We're also told, by the opposition, that locking
up the land in wilderness would deal the death blow to an already
ailing (pick one) logging, mining, or ranching industry.
   Congress is left to sort it out, and the politics of compromise
leave no one completely satisfied.
   ``It's amazing that this is going to be decided in some room in
the Capitol, 3,000 miles away,'' Stone says. ``It doesn't have
anything to do with Idaho wilderness. It's who owes McClure a favor
at the time.''
   Whatever happens with Idaho, Congress faces enough other
wilderness issues to keep busy for another 25 years.
   It must decide whether 1.5 million acres of tundra in Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is worth more for the caribou that
migrate over it or for the oil reservoirs that may lie under it.
   Battles also loom over vast Bureau of Land Management holdings in
the deserts of Utah, Nevada, California and other Western states.
The BLM has inventoried about 25 million acres of potential
wilderness and is likely to recommend some fraction of that for
designation. The Wilderness Society says it will push for far more.
   Protecting entire ecosystems has become preservationists' latest
rallying cry. They hope to expand existing wilderness areas around
Yellowstone National Park and in the Great Smoky Mountains of North
Carolina and Tennessee.
   Lynne Stone, meanwhile, focuses on her own wild Idaho backyard.
When lobbying, she argues the dollars and cents of tourism. But her
real motives for saving wilderness prove more elusive, more personal.
   In an alpine meadow flushed purple with blooming lupines, Stone
gazes at a horizon of sawtoothed peaks and tries to explain her love
for the land. She talks vaguely of hiking with friends, of the world
she hopes her 11-year-old son will inherit.
   Finally, she settles on words borrowed from a friend who has
guided hunters and fishermen in the wild for years. ``He says they
don't really come for the hunting or fishing. They come for the hush
of the land.''
   A breeze rustles through the whitebark pines and sweeps across
the lupines. A far-off chickadee squeaks out a song. ``That's what
I'm trying to protect,'' Stone says. ``The hush of the land.''

<DATELINE>PELICAN ISLAND NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two female
brown pelicans snap their beaks, croak and flap their wings at two
male interlopers swooping down to a bare mangrove branch.
   The sea birds are fighting for precious space on three-acre
Pelican Island, the nation's first wildlife refuge and the smallest
parcel to receive the federal wilderness designation.
   ``We see it as sort of the flagship of the refuge system due to
its age,'' said Charles Lee, senior vice president of the Florida
Audubon Society. ``While we've drawn a federal boundary around those
lands, the fact is they are being threatened on a daily basis by
encroaching development.''
   As hundreds of pelicans and other birds fight for space on the
sandy scrap of land in the refuge, developers on the bordering
Orchid Island have construction crews tearing into old grapefruit
groves to make room for exclusive golf and polo club developments.
Bare oceanfront lots with 125-foot frontage are offered for $800,000.
   President Theodore Roosevelt created the refuge by proclamation
in 1903 after hearing stories of plume hunters killing the island's
exotic birds for ladies' hats and pleasure boaters firing away for
sport.
   Pelican Island remains what it was then: a choice rookery in the
Indian River Lagoon, a mile-wide section of the Intracoastal
Waterway that separates the mainland of Central Florida near
Sebastian from the citrus-rich barrier island of Orchid on the
Atlantic Ocean.
   ``To you or I, it doesn't look like there's anything unusual
about the island, except there's almost no green. Pelicans will
break off any green shoots for their nests,'' explained Dorn
Whitmore, refuge spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The refuge protects 4,700 acres, but the wilderness area shields
only Pelican Island and three acres of surrounding water 1 to 2 feet
deep.
   The island is strictly for the birds _ no human visitors are
allowed except by federal wildlife officers and occasional
scientific parties.
   Adjacent to the refuge on the east, 200 to 225 units are proposed
for the 400-acre Windsor Polo and Beach Club, which has drawn
Britain's Prince Charles as a player. To the southeast, an 18-hole
golf course is the centerpiece of the planned 400-unit Orchid Island
Golf &amp; Beach Club.
   ``What we've got is a very viable, very valuable resource with a
potential for a great deal of stress. The question is: `How do we
manage it so we can keep on using it?''' asked Diane Barile,
executive director of the Marine Resources Council, a 500-member
group for Indian River Lagoon interests.
   She worries that the condition of the lagoon will continue to
degrade, citing studies showing a 30 percent loss of sea grass beds
and an 80 percent loss of filtering mangrove swamps in the area.
   ``We have the highest species diversity of any estuary in North
America. We can outdo Chesapeake Bay or Puget Sound, any of those
places,'' she said. ``If you're out there in a sailboat or a small
boat, you do get the feeling of release and being in a wild and
lonely place and being a part of the land and the water itself. It's
really a magical place.''

   Just 25 miles from the flashing
lights and honking horns of New York City's Times Square is a large,
green oasis filled with the lovely sounds of silence.
   The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, situated in the heart
of congested northern New Jersey, was officially declared a
protected area in 1968 under the federal Wilderness Act.
   Since then, it has attracted urban and suburban residents looking
for a secluded escape. David Franz, a biology professor at Brooklyn
College, sometimes brings his students across the Hudson River to
study ``forest communities'' and analyze vegetation at the refuge.
   On his own time, he visits Great Swamp ``just for the beauty of
it all. Especially in the fall, when the foliage changes. On a
Sunday afternoon, I often see families stopping at the refuge after
church just to spend a few hours outside together.''
   The refuge is open from dawn to dusk seven days a week, said
Thomas McFadden, a recreation planner at Great Swamp. It might never
have opened at all.
   In the late 1950s, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
proposed building a jetport at the site.
   But local residents quickly formed a grassroots organization to
buy as much land as possible. Several years later, the newly formed
New Jersey Conservation Foundation gave the federal government the
deed to about 3,000 acres of prime, undeveloped land which formed
the heart of Great Swamp, McFadden said.
   The refuge's acreage keeps growing, with almost 7,000 acres now
protected and the acquisition of 2,000 more acres expected soon.
   About 3,660 acres of the refuge is untouched, with only seven
miles of trails for nature lovers to walk on, McFadden said. The
rest is a federal management area, where grass is mowed, ponds dug
and trees cut to encourage the breeding of certain animals and
plants, he said.
   ``It's unusual to find a fairly large tract of uninhabited
natural vegetation,'' Franz said appreciatively.
   Even though planes pass overhead and neighboring towns edge
closer, he said, ``You have the feeling you are a long distance from
mankind.''
   More than 160,000 people _ most from the New York metropolitan
area _ visit the Great Swamp each year, McFadden said.
   Unfortunately, unwanted visitors also come, said Douglas Spencer,
the refuge's assistant property manager. By day, passing vehicles
litter roads leading into the refuge, he said, and at night, illegal
dumpers have left even worse.
   Nearby development also has an impact. ``It causes non-point
pollution _ runoff from septic systems and the streets,'' Spencer
said.
   With each rainfall, pollutants such as roadway oils and treated
sewage effluent wash into the Passaic River watershed area, which
eventually passes through the refuge, Spencer said.
   ``Great Swamp acts as a giant filter,'' he said.

   Credit cards that respond only to their owner's
voice have been invented by scientists at Bell Communications
Research, officials announced.
   A card owner could put the card in a bank teller machine that was
equipped with a microphone and then speak a password instead of
punching in a four-character identification code, Bellcore
researchers said Monday.
   The system could also work with telephone calling cards, consumer
credit cards and doors that use card locks, Bellcore said.
   The system capitalizes on the premise that no two voices are
alike. It compares the spoken words with the voice pattern stored
digitally on the card.
   Bellcore said it has patented the system and plans to license it
to other companies. Bellcore does research for the seven regional
Bell phone companies as well as Cincinnati Bell and Southern New
England Telephone.

   Toys ``R'' Us Inc. is voluntarily recalling
9,600 ``Siren Whistle'' toys because young children might choke on
them, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
   The commission said Monday that neither it nor the manufacturer
knows of any injuries caused by the toy, but said the action is
being taken as a precaution.
   The whistles break apart easily and small parts could be ingested
by a child, the commission said. It said the company discovered the
problem after receiving a consumer complaint that a child sucked the
metal noisemaker from the whistle into his mouth and then coughed it
out.
   The products consist of sets of five or eight solid-color
whistles made of plastic, measuring 1 3@4 inches long. They are
identified as ``Siren Whistles'' from Lucky Star Enterprises and
Unique Industries and are manufactured in Taiwan.
   Consumers were advised to take the toys from their children and
return them to the nearest Toys ``R'' Us store.
   The commission also said that Arcotoys Inc. has announced a
voluntary recall of certain toy vehicles and the character ``Goofy''
in the company's Disney Donald's Fun Farm and Disney World Airport.
   Tests by the commission showed that wheels attached to the
vehicles' axles and Goofy's ears could separate and be swallowed,
although no injuries have been reported.
   Consumers may remove the items and return them to Arcotoys Inc.,
800 Shemes Drive, Westbury, N.Y. 11590 for an exchange with
comparable vehicles and characters.
   In the Disney Donald's Fun Farm, No. 6112, remove the four-wheel
tractor.
   In the Disney World Airport, No. 6113, remove the four-wheel
blue, yellow and red vehicles which have blue or yellow wheels; and
remove the ``Goofy'' who has long ears, a gold hat and shoes, an
orange shirt, a green vest, brown pants and white hands.
   The Fun Farm toy was imported from Hong Kong.

<HEAD>First-Half Business Failures Down Sharply, Supporting `Soft Landing'
Theory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business failures fell by 14.5 percent in the
first half of 1989, the biggest drop in more than 10 years, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Corp. said in a report that suggested the economy is not
tumbling into recession.
   ``The steady decline in business failures across the country
underscores the overall stability of the U.S. economy and offers
further support for the `soft-landing' scenario,'' said Joseph W.
Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician for the
business-information company.
   A total of 26,234 companies failed in the first six months of
1989, vs. 30,697 in the first six months of 1988, D&amp;B said Monday in
its twice-yearly report on business failures. The figures reflect a
continuation of a trend that began in 1987 and showed a sharp
improvement in the weak farming and oil regions.
   Failures declined everywhere except in South Atlantic states, one
of the areas that has led an economic expansion now almost seven
years old. The number of failures in that region rose 10.2 percent
to 4.024 from 3,651.
   The area of greatest decrease was in the agricultural belt of the
western and north central states, where failures declined 31.3
percent, to 1,582 from 2,304.
   By industry, failures in the agriculture-forestry-fishing sector
fell 23.5 percent, failures in the mining sector fell 25.4 percent,
wholesale trade fell 23 percent, and services fell 23.8 percent.
   The only industry to report an increase in failures was the
finance, insurance and real-estate sector, where they rose 11.7
percent. D&amp;B attributed the rise to the thrift industry crisis and
scattered problems in the property business.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet is the largest marketer of business information,
with wordwide revenue of $4.3 billion last year.

   The debate continues over whether the Chicago
Board of Trade should have ordered the emergency liquidation of July
soybean futures contracts.
   ``It's becoming more and more evident that the cost of this
liquidation was all put on the back of the producers,'' said John
White Jr. of the American Farm Bureau Federation.
   But Donald M. Mennel, an Ohio representative of the Millers'
National Federation, said he thought the BOT ``did a magnificent job
of moving very rapidly to stop something that could have gone
horribly wrong.''
   Mennel and White were among more than a score of farmers,
ranchers, exporters, grain dealers and elevator operators who
debated the soybean emergency action Monday at a meeting of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission's agricultural advisory
committee.
   Last month, the Board of Trade issued an emergency order
requiring traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures
contracts. The move brought howls of protest from farmers and
traders, who saw the value of their futures holdings plummet after
the order caused wild swings in soybean prices.
   The CBOT's action was taken after a U.S. affiliate of the Italian
grain conglomerate Ferruzzi Finanziaria SPA refused to liquidate its
dominant position in July soybeans. The action was seen as a move to
prevent Ferruzzi from cornering the soybean market, a plan which
Ferruzzi has denied.
   ``To decide what we decided was sort of like going against apple
pie,'' said Darl Kleinbach, a wheat farmer who also sits as a public
director on the CBOT and voted for the emergency action. But she
defended her vote as ``best for the farmer.''
   The American Agriculture Movement's Larry Mitchell told CFTC
officials, ``Farmers want to know, who did you protect with that
action?''
   ``The answer is the market,'' said John Mielke, CFTC director of
market surveillance, explaining that the agency's mission was to
preserve orderly markets. ``We have to be price neutral.''
   The CFTC, which oversees the futures industry, released its
preliminary findings Friday on the CBOT action. The CFTC found that
there was a ``reasonable basis for the emergency'' and that the
Board of Trade took appropriate action.
   The CFTC also said it found no evidence of self-dealing by CBOT
officials who might have profited by selling off their holdings
after voting to issue the emergency order.
   But farm group leaders remained skeptical.
   ``Their (farmers') perception now is that the market's been
manipulated by those internal forces and CFTC is part of that for
allowing the emergency action,'' said White of the American Farm
Bureau Federation.
   Roy Smith, a Nebraska soybean farmer and representative of the
American Soybean Association, told the CFTC's Mielke: ``To be honest
with you, the farmers are tired of hearing you guys say everything
is all right, of hearing the Board of Trade say it's all right.
We're getting a different perception out there.''
   The St. Louis-based American Soybean Association has formed its
own task force to probe the results of the emergency order.
   None of the CBOT directors who voted personally controlled a
position in July soybean futures, according to the CFTC.
   When several agricultural groups said they wanted more evidence
proving that there had been no inside trading by CBOT executives
either for their firm or their firm's customers, Mielke said he
doubted it would defuse conspiracy theories.
   ``I'm not sure the facts, even if they were laid out, would put
the questions to rest,'' said Mielke. ``I think people with theories
don't need facts.''
   ``I think you're underestimating the ability of farmers to
understand the facts,'' countered Smith.

<TEXT>
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la
Garza, just back from a trip to the Soviet Union, says the United
States should import more Soviet goods in exchange for the
commodities the it sells that country.
   De la Garza, D-Texas, said Monday that his five-day visit made it
clear to him that the Soviet Union is a long way from becoming
self-sufficient in grain production and will continue to turn to the
United States for that commodity.
   He said the Soviet Union also could use other U.S. items but has
a hard time getting them because Soviet currency is not accepted and
the United States has shown little interest in Soviet products other
than vodka.
   ``Everything they need for the comfort of the creature, we could
sell them,'' said de la Garza. ``But they have no hard currency.''
   Agriculture Department officials say the Soviets buy American
grain with dollars that they can get by drawing upon their gold
reserves.
   De la Garza said that a better understanding is developing
between the United States and U.S.S.R.
   ``We need to look at how we can reshape our relations so we can
buy and sell,'' he said. ``We need to remove the feeling that all we
want to do is sell, sell, sell.''
   He said the first imports may be ``symbolic'' but would go a long
way toward achieving an arrangement that shows trade ``is a two-way
street.''
   The Soviets have an agreement with the United States that they
will buy at least 9 million tons of grain before Sept. 30. They have
already purchased 21.7 million tons of grain and corn and another 1
million tons of sorghum, says the Agriculture Department.
   Agriculture Committee members Reps. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Jerry
Huckaby, D-La., Robin Tallon, D-S.C., Claude Harris, D-Ala. and
David Dreier, R-Calif., accompanied de la Garza on the trip.
   They did not see Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev but met with
other top officials to discuss agricultural reform and enhanced
trade between the two countries. They also visited cooperative farms
and markets.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has given South Korea
30 more days to reach an agreement on driftnet fishing or face a
possible ban on fish exports to the United States.
   The action Monday came on the heels of an agreement with Taiwan
last week that will allow the United States to monitor its use of
driftnets in the North Pacific. Earlier this year Japan entered into
a similar arrangement.
   But so far the United States and South Korea have been unable to
come to terms on monitoring use of the enormous nets, which U.S.
fisherman complain are making unauthorized catches of salmon,
dolphins and other species.
   The vacationing president, in a letter to leaders of Congress,
said he was instructing the State and Commerce departments ``to
continue intensive bilateral negotiations with Korea'' over the
fishing dispute.
   If they don't produce an agreement within 30 days, ``I will be
prepared to exercise my substantial authorities'' under the
Fishermen's Protective Act that allows him to order the prohibition
of fish imports from offending countries, the president said.
   ``It is extremely important to the international community that
Korea agrees to meet the standards of customary international law to
cooperate with other nations and to take necessary measures to
conserve high seas resources affected by driftnets,'' he said.
   He said the U.S. officials conducting the negotiatons should also
try ``to engage the international community in urging the adoption
of cooperative measures on driftnet fishing.''
   The driftnets used by Asian fleets are intended to catch squid,
but the nets can also ensnare dolphins, seals and salmon.
   The U.S.-Taiwan agreement allows federal authorities to track
Taiwanese fishing vessels by satellite with radio transponders
installed in those boats and also permits U.S. officials to board
the ships.
   Conservationists have criticized the driftnets, some of which are
40 miles long, for their ``incidental'' catches of thousands of sea
birds, seals and other animals, as well as valuable salmon that
spawn in the United States.
   Congress had set a deadline of Monday for Bush to act.
   Japan signed an agreement in June that called for the
experimental use of transponders and a cadre of 47 observers _ nine
American, five Canadian and 33 Japanese _ to monitor driftnet damage
to marine mammal populations.

   New Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu hopes to build warm
ties during his trip to the United States this week, and he will
stress the need for both countries to do more to reduce their trade
imbalance, officials said.
   Japanese prime ministers customarily visit Washington shortly
after taking office to establish good working relations, but Kaifu
also hopes he can use the trip to establish his own diplomatic
credentials and revitalize his government's foreign policy, the
officials said Monday.
   Kaifu, who on Aug. 9 became Japan's third prime minister in less
than three months, is a former education minister with little
experience in foreign affairs. His Liberal Democratic party, which
pursues conservative policies, has been rocked by a series of money
and sex scandals that have put diplomatic initiatives on hold.
   The 58-year-old prime minister leaves Wednesday for Washington
and will later visit Mexico and Canada. He will meet Friday with
President Bush and then visit Boston, where he plans to meet with
academics and watch a Red Sox game, according to Yukio Okamoto,
director of the Foreign Ministry's First North America Division.
   Bush is expected to seek a commitment from Kaifu that Japan will
reform areas of its business and distribution system that the United
States says limit foreign access.
   Foreign Ministry officials said Kaifu will tell Bush that Japan
is willing to pursue major reform, but that the United States also
must institute changes if substantial improvement in the trade
imbalance is to be made.
   ``Japan is prepared to address her own structural issues, and
indeed we have been addressing ourselves to these problems,'' said
Mitoji Yabunaka, director of the ministry's Second North America
Division. ``But efforts should be made by both sides.''
   Yabunaka said Japan would ask the United States to boost its
savings and business investment rates, work harder to promote
exports, improve its vocational training, and seek long-term
investments rather than short-term profits.
   ``These are very serious issues, and there is no quick fix,'' he
said.
   Japan has made major reductions in tariffs and other import
barriers in recent years. U.S. and Japanese officials have begun to
say that the trade imbalance now stems mainly from social and
business structures and practices in both countries.
   The United States has said Japan's complex distribution system
and ingrown business relationships make it difficult for foreign
companies to penetrate the market, and Japan's high saving rate
reduces its purchases of foreign goods.
   Last year, Japan's trade surplus with the United States was $55
billion, according to U.S. figures.
   On other issues, Okamoto said, ``Mr. Kaifu will be making clear
to the president that there will be no change whatsoever in our
basic position in our foreign policy.''
   In addition to forming a working relationship with U.S.
officials, Kaifu plans to reach out to the American public, he said.
   ``We expect Mr. Kaifu's personal traits _ young, energetic,
accessible, a caring personality _ will be well received by our
American friends,'' he said.
   Kaifu's will visit Mexico Sept. 4-6. The newspaper Yomiuri
Shimbun reported Monday that Kaifu will offer Mexican officials a $1
billion loan to help combat air pollution in Mexico City.
   Kaifu is to meet with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada in
Ottawa on Sept. 7, Okamoto said.

   A brake shoe manufacturer will not have to
pay a record $2.7 million fine for asbestos exposure violations
under terms of a settlement with the federal government.
   U.S. District Judge Garrett Brown on Monday approved a pact
between the Labor Department and Friction Division Products Inc. The
agreement requires the Trenton factory to provide respirators,
protective clothing and other safety measures for its 125 workers.
   If a safety monitor certifies the company's compliance, Friction
Division will avoid paying what would amount to the heftiest fine
ever levied by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for
a safety violation, officials said.
   The agreement requires no admission of wrongdoing by the factory.
   Company President Robert Carney had not immediate comment on the
agreement, his secretary said.
   Federal officials, when they announced the fine a month ago,
described flagrant violations of worker protection standards at the
plant.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole displayed photographs of asbestos
dust coating tables, stairs and railings and of workers eating in a
lunchroom while wearing contaminated work clothes.
   Federal officials also said the workers could bring the asbestos
home on their contaminated clothing, exposing their families.
   The agreement, in addition to requiring respirators, orders the
company to supply soap and towels for mandatory end-of-shift showers
and to make sure employees' clothes are vacuumed before workers
enter the lunchroom.
   Asbestos, a fire- and heat-resisting material once commonly used
as insulation, has been linked to lung cancer and asbestosis, a lung
disease.
   If the company does not follow through on the agreement, OSHA
will revert to the fine and other remedies, said Randy Wilson, a
labor department public affairs officer in New York.
   The head of a union local representing the plant's employees said
he was pleased by the agreement.
   However, Ivey Williams, president of International Chemical
Workers Local 155, said the union was still considering a lawsuit to
help the workers win compensation for whatever health damage they
may have suffered.
   The workers _ about half of whom have stayed off the job since
disclosure of the safety violations _ are undergoing health
screenings, he said.
   Mrs. Dole said last month that investigators had found a handful
of cases of lung cancer and asbestosis among the workers.

   Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank have agreed to merge
next April to create the second-largest bank in the world, officials
of the two banks announced Tuesday.
   Analysts said the merger is the biggest international combination
in recent memory.
   ``In terms of sheer scale there's nothing like it,'' said Simon
Smithson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities. ``It dwarfs
anything that exists'' in other countries, he said.
   The new bank will be second in total assets only to Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, ranked the largest in the world in terms of assets.
Currently, Sumitomo Bank is the second-largest bank in Japan.
   Mitsui Bank, the country's seventh-largest bank, and Taiyo Kobe,
the eighth largest, will merge into a new bank to be called Taiyo
Kobe Mitsui Bank as of April 1, Kenichi Suematsu, president of
Mitsui Bank, said at a news conference.
   ``Facing today's globalization and liberalization of the
financial world ... a bank must have a certain degree of size or
quality can't follow,'' said Suematsu, who will become the president
of the new bank.
   ``We have judged forming a new bank by a merger will lead to
providing the best financial and information services to our
customers,'' said Yasuo Matsushita, president of Taiyo Kobe Bank,
who will become chairman of the new bank.
   Suematsu and Matsushita, who said they were close friends for
over 20 years, said they hope the merger will strengthen their
banks' domestic and international networks, and expand and
rationalize operations to meet increasingly diverse needs.
   The Finance Ministry and banking circles generally praised the
merger.
   ``I welcome the decision by both banks to merge, given the
liberalization and internationalization of the financial market,''
said Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. ``I think it is timely to
bolster the operation by utilizing increased profits to provide a
diversity of sevices to customers in and out of the country.''
   Kuniji Miyazaki, president of the Federation of Bankers'
Associations of Japan and also of Japan's largest bank,
Daiichi-Kangyo Bank, hailed what he called a ``courageous decision''
by the banks' managements, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Mitsui Bank, one of the oldest banks in this country, founded in
1876, had available funds of 21.138 trillion yen, or $146.79
billion, at the end of March 1989, 9,760 employees, and 242 branches
in Japan and overseas, while Taiyo Kobe had funds of 18.511 trillion
yen, or $128.54 billion, 12,931 employees and 374 branches,
according to statistics released by both banks.
   Mitsui Bank is capitalized at $1.36 billion, while Taiyo Kobe
Bank is capitalized at $1.25 billion.
   It will be the second major merger for Taiyo Kobe Bank, which was
formed by a merger between Taiyo Bank and Kobe Bank in 1973.
   Matsushita and Suematsu stressed that the deal is an equal
merger, but said the two companies will exchange shares at the rate
of eight Mitsui shares for 10 Taiyo Kobe shares. They said the name
of the new bank will be reviewed and changed in three years because
it is ``too long,'' said Suematsu.
   The bank will be known as Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in English,
reversing the names in the Japanese version, Taiyo Kobe Mitsui
Ginko, company officials said.
   Analysts said the merger is apparently aimed at consolidating and
streamlining their operations to take advantage of forthcoming
banking liberalization measures in Japan.
   The merger happened ``because neither bank was really big enough
to fufill its ambitions on its own,'' Smithson said.
   Analysts said that the merger would join Taiyo Kobe's extensive
domestic network with Mitsui's international expertise, and create
the economies of scale that are the basis of Japanese banks'
international competitiveness.
   Japanese banks are generally considered less sophisticated in
many aspects of international business than their American or
European competitors despute their overwhelming size, but can rely
on huge deposits at home to create volume discounts.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading of Mitsui and Taiyo
Kobe Banks shares all day Tuesday due to the merger, the exchange
said.

   Bondholders of Resorts International
Inc. face an indefinite halt on interest payments while the gaming
company tries to rise above its huge debt, company officials said.
   Resorts owner and Chairman Merv Griffin issued a statement Monday
to bondholders of the company and its subsidiaries, Resorts
International Finance Inc. and Griffin Resorts Inc.
   ``It has become clear that Resorts is a much bigger challenge
than we anticipated,'' the entertainer wrote.
   ``Obviously, I am not pleased that Resorts finds itself in the
position that it must suspend interest payments,'' he said. ``But I
believe that it is necessary in order to ensure the long-term
financial health of the corporation.''
   Griffin's explanation did not comfort some bondholders.
   The default ``is proof of the misstatements that were made about
the company's financial condition,'' said Edward Labaton, a New York
attorney who filed a class action lawsuit in May on behalf of one
bondholder, Peter Stuyvesant Ltd.
   The lawsuit alleges that Resorts' top officers inflated the worth
of the company for a prospectus issued by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., which last year offered $325 million worth of notes on top of
more than $600 million worth of Resorts' existing notes.
   Monday's announcement ``merely confirms the concerns that were
expressed in our complaint,'' Labaton said.
   Griffin, the wealthy creator of syndicated television game shows
such as ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy!'' bought the Atlantic
City-based Resorts International from developer Donald Trump in
November for $365 million.
   In his letter, Griffin explained that operating cash flow has
been less than anticipated, ``in part because we underestimated the
time and capital expenditures it would take to turn around the
company's operations to generate increased profits.''
   The former talk show host also wrote that it has taken Resorts
longer to sell non-operating real estate assets than originally
expected.
   Resorts President David Hanlon insisted Monday that the company
is not on the verge of bankruptcy.
   ``From a short-term point of view, we have clearly demonstrated
our financial viability,'' he said. ``And we made a decision some
time ago that we have to solve the problem on a long-term basis,
which involves major recapitalization.''
   The recapitalization plan will be outlined at a Sept. 19
bondholders meeting, Hanlon said. Interest payments could resume
once such a plan is in place, which could take several months, he
said.
   Marvin Roffman, a gaming industry analyst with the Philadelphia
brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said Monday that Griffin's
deal ``probably will be an equity (stock) enticement in return for a
reduction in interest rates or principal payments.''
   Resorts faces payments of more than $130 million in interest and
principal this year, but its operations will not likely generate
enough money to cover that. In 1988, the company's cash flow was
only $60.2 million; revenues totaled $456 million.
   According to figures released earlier this month, Resorts posted
a $27.9 million net loss for the second quarter, compared with a
$13.8 million loss for the same period in 1988. Revenues for the
second quarter totaled $110.2 million, down from $122.3 million in
the 1988 quarter.
   In his letter, Griffin told the bondholders that he continues to
believe Resorts ``can become a valuable and successful company. I
invested $50 million personally and have provided a letter of credit
of $10 million based on that belief.''
   Monday's announcement, however, could harm Griffin's chances of
winning a permanent casino license. The state Casino Control
Commission will hold hearings next month to consider whether Resorts
has enough financial stability to merit changing Griffin's interim
authorization into a license.
   Resorts bonds have a face value of $1,000 and were issued at
interest rates ranging from 10 percent to 16| percent. In recent
weeks, the bonds have traded at prices ranging from $355 to $390.
   In addition to the Resorts hotel and casino in Atlantic City, the
company owns more than 700 acres of Atlantic City land and
properties in the Bahamas, including the Paradise Island Resort and
Casino.

<HEAD>Former Actors Buy Majority Interest in RKO Pictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pavilion Communications Inc., a company
founded by two former actors, has acquired a majority interest in
RKO Pictures, which in Hollywood's heyday produced such classic
films as ``Citizen Kane,'' ``King Kong,'' ``The Bells of St. Marys''
and ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
   Terms of the deal to buy the RKO stake from Wesray Capital Inc.
weren't disclosed. Ted Hartley and Dina Merrill, former TV and film
actors who founded Pavilion last year, will be the largest
shareholders in the new company, to be known as RKO-Pavilion.
   The RKO Pictures name will be retained for the motion picture
development and production division.
   Pavilion will obtain remake and sequel rights to RKO's
650-picture library, and Hartley said in an interview that he hopes
to remake Orson Welles' classic ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' and to
adapt films to other media _ perhaps a Broadway musical.
   ``We want to bring back a memorable and respected name into the
active production of films, both new and sequels and remakes,'' said
Hartley.
   Miss Merrill was an actress in ``Hotel'' and ``Hot Pursuit,''
among other television roles, and appeared in a string of movies,
including ``The Sundowners'' and ``The Courtship of Eddie's
Father.'' She operated a low-budget film production company before
teaming with Hartley.
   Hartley has been a Navy test pilot and an investment banker as
well as an actor. His acting ranged from the movie ``High Plains
Drifter'' with Clint Eastwood to the quickly canceled ABC-TV series
``Chopper One'' in 1978.
   ``The idea is to be a creatively nurturing company,'' Hartley
said. ``We wanted to create the kind of company where creative
people felt comfortable to work.''
   He will be chairman of the new company. Miss Merrill will head
the creative staff.
   Rights to the RKO library other than sequel and remake use were
purchased by Turner Entertainment in 1986. Entrepreneur Ted Turner's
plans for a color version of ``Citizen Kane'' caused a huge uproar a
year later before he decided against the project.
   Currently, RKO has ``The Narrow Margin'' in production at
Carolco, with Gene Hackman and Anne Archer starring and Peter Hyams
writing and directing.
   Pavilion also purchased the rights to a small number of recent
RKO movies, including ``Plenty,'' ``Half Moon Street'' and ``Hot
Pursuit.''
   RKO's old radio tower-atop-the-world trademark will be updated,
Hartley said. ``We're going to redesign and synthesize into a modern
symbol,'' he said.

   Share prices were lower at midday as technical
pressures in a thin market countered support from Wall Street's
overnight strength.
   Traders reported no institutional buying. One securities analyst
said that with the market at its post-crash highs and entering the
final leg of a three-week trading account, ``people are a wee bit
uncomfortable'' about buying.
   Others said they did not expect a major sellout and predicted
that market makers could step in as buyers once the market appears

   ``I don't think we're going to go down much from here, maybe off

   Volume was a thin 172.9 million shares, compared with 269.4

<TEXT>
   Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank have agreed to merge
next April, creating the second largest bank in the world, bank
officials said today.
   Analysts said the bank merger was the biggest in recent memory.
   ``In terms of sheer scale there's nothing like it,'' said Simon
Smithson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities. ``It dwarfs
anything that exists.''
   The new bank will be second in total assets only to Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, ranked the largest in the world in assets. Currently,
Sumitomo Bank is the second largest bank in Japan.
   Mitsui Bank, the country's seventh largest bank, and Taiyo Kobe,
the eighth largest, will merge into a new bank to be called Taiyo
Kobe Mitsui Bank as of April 1, Kenichi Suematsu, president of
Mitsui Bank, said at a news conference.
   ``Facing today's globalization and liberalization of the
financial world ... a bank must have a certain degree of size or
quality can't follow,'' said Suematsu, who will become the president
of the new bank.
   ``We have judged forming a new bank by a merger will lead to
providing the best financial and information services to our
customers,'' said Yasuo Matsushita, president of Taiyo Kobe Bank,
who will become chairman of the new bank.
   Suematsu and Matsushita, who described themselves as close
friends for over 20 years, said they hope the merger will strengthen
their banks' domestic and international networks.
   The Finance Ministry and banking circles generally favored the
merger.
   ``I welcome the decision by both banks to merge, given the
liberalization and internationalization of the financial market,''
said Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. ``I think it is timely to
bolster the operation by utilizing increased profits to provide a
diversity of services to customers in and out of the country.''
   Kuniji Miyazaki, president of the Federation of Bankers'
Associations of Japan and also of Japan's largest bank,
Daiichi-Kangyo Bank, hailed what he called a ``courageous decision''
by the banks' managements, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Mitsui Bank, one of the oldest banks in Japan, founded in 1876,
had $147 billion in funds at the end of March, 9,760 employees and
242 branches worldwide, while Taiyo Kobe had funds of $128 billion,
12,931 employees and 374 branches, according to both banks.
   It will be the second major merger for Taiyo Kobe Bank, which was
formed by a merger between Taiyo Bank and Kobe Bank in 1973.
   While Matsushita and Suematsu said the deal was ``straight up,''
the two companies will exchange eight Mitsui shares for every 10
Taiyo Kobe shares. They said the name of the new bank will be
reviewed and changed in three years, because it is ``too long,''
said Suematsu.
   The bank's name in English, ``Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank,'' reverses
the name in the Japanese version, ``Taiyo Kobe Mitsui Ginko
(bank),'' company officials said.
   Analysts said that the merger would join Taiyo Kobe's extensive
domestic network with Mitsui's international expertise, and create
economies of scale that are the basis of Japanese banks'
international competitiveness.
   In terms of assets, Japanese banks dominate the 10 largest banks
in the world, according to American Banker, a New York-based daily
newspaper.
   ``This may ignite a series of similar mergers in Japan,'' said
Thomas Zengage, senior analyst at International Business Institute,
a consulting firm in Tokyo.
   ``Amid the deregulation and intensifying competition, Japanese
banks' perception about a merger is changing,'' said Zengage, adding
that mergers in Japan's banking industry often had been considered
undesirable unless one company was near bankruptcy and needed a
partner's help.
   Japanese banks are generally considered less sophisticated in
many aspects of international business than their American or
European competitors despite their overwhelming size, but can rely
on huge deposits at home to create volume discounts.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading of Mitsui and Taiyo
Kobe Banks shares today for the day.

<TEXT>
   Boeing Aerospace and Electronics, a unit of Boeing
Co., said it will eliminate about 800 secretaries, engineers and
managers from its space and missile programs.
   Spokesman Dave Suffia said the company ``will make every effort''
to reassign affected employees to other jobs at Boeing. The cuts
will take effect over the next month, Boeing said.
   The reductions reflect the company's desire for greater
efficiency in the 22,000-person division in the face of defense
spending cuts and projections that Boeing will lose money on
government contracts this year.
   Employees at the Kent-based division were notified of the cuts on
Friday.
   The aerospace and electronics unit works on National Aeronautics
and Space Administration programs such as the space shuttle and the
space station.
   It also has military contracts, including a missile system for
the U.S. Navy, the Airborne Advanced Warning and Control System
(AWACS) and Strategic Defense Initiative programs.
   About 18,000 of the division's employees work in Washington state.

<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. officials hope a new president
can turn around the company's recent drop in earnings by focusing on
network computer systems and software.
   Unisys' board of directors Monday promoted James Unruh to
president and chief operating officer, putting him in line to
succeed the 63-year-old chairman and chief executive, Michael
Blumenthal.
   Before Unruh's promotion, the company had no president and chief
operating officer.
   ``His top priority will be to strengthen the company's financial
position by improving profitability and cash flow and to continue
the company's thrust into the faster-growing markets of distributed
network computing systems and software and services,'' Blumenthal
said in a news release.
   Unruh will handle all computer business except defense sales.
   Unruh, 48, beat out Curtis Hessler, 45, for the No. 2 job at the
computer giant. Hessler, who worked with Blumenthal when he was
Treasury secretary in the Carter administration, and Unruh, a former
Burroughs executive, were viewed as the two candidates to take over
when Blumenthal retires.
   Blumenthal, who engineered Burrough's takeover of Sperry to form
Unisys, has indicated he may step down in two years.
   Hessler was promoted from executive vice president to vice
chairman. Hessler's duties still include chief financial officer and
head of the Defense Systems Group.
   ``Curt Hessler is a key member of the management team and this
promotion recognizes the substantial contributions he has made and
the broad expertise he brings to the corporation,'' Blumenthal said.
   Unisys reported a 67 percent drop in earnings for the second
quarter. Blumenthal attributed the decrease to the expense of
cutting inventories, pricing pressures from competitors and the
temporary suspension of Unisys' defense business by the Pentagon.
The strong dollar also decreased the value of sales made in foreign
currencies, he said.
   For the second quarter, Unisys reported net income of $53.6
million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $2.57 billion. In the
second three months of 1988, net income totaled $162.3 million.
   The Unisys board also promoted Reto Braun to senior vice
president and named him president of the Americas-Pacific Division.
The new division combines the former Pacific-Asia Division and the
Americas Division. G. Graham Murphy, president of the Europe-Africa
division, was promoted to senior vice president.

   Britain is entering a period of slow investment
growth, modest increases in manufacturing output and subdued
consumer spending, the Confederation of British Industry said
Tuesday.
   The organization representing big business said manufacturers'
order books this month were below normal for the fourth consecutive
month while their output growth continued at rates much lower than a
year ago.
   David Wigglesworth, who heads the confederation's industrial
trends survey, said companies would trim spending to protect profit
margins.
   ``There is clearly a danger that in this process, investment will
be cut back, with a damaging effect on the nation's ability to
compete in international markets,'' he said.
   Analysts blame Britain's high 14 percent base bank lending rates
for most of the industrial and consumer spending slowdown.
   The Financial Times business daily said Tuesday that most
forecasting groups it surveyed expect the interest rates to remain
at about 14 percent for the rest of this year.
   ``Even in the last three months of 1990, interest rates of about
12 percent are expected,'' it said. ``Consumer spending is also
expected to slow dramatically ... After growing by about 3 percent
this year, the survey points to growth of only 1.7 percent in 1990,
the lowest annual growth rate since 1982.''
   The daily said inflation was expected to fall from a little below
7 percent in the last quarter of this year to just above 5 percent
in a year's time.
   However, it predicted exports would grow, reflecting expectations
of stronger economic growth in other countries.
   Britain had its second worst monthly trade deficit in July of 2.1
billion pounds, or $3.2 billion, suggesting the deficit for the year
will be around 20 billion pounds against the Treasury's official
forecasts of 14.5 billion pounds.
   The high interest rate, which is fixed by the government, is a
means of keeping the British pound strong in world currency markets
at a time of slow industrial growth.
   Anne Segall, a financial commentator, wrote Tuesday in the
conservative Daily Telegraph: ``While we were nearly 10 billion
pounds in deficit in the first six months of this year, West Germany
was 20 billion pounds in surplus ... Britain's deficit is eight
times as big as France's ... We are now overspending the equivalent
of 4 percent of gross domestic product ... We are in an even bigger
mess than the Americans.''

<HEAD>Federal Court Reverses Dismissal of Shareholder Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that a shareholder
lawsuit against Sundstrand Corp. can be brought to trial, reversing
his March ruling that the claims should first be submitted to the
company's board, Sundstrand says.
   The lawsuit seeks to recover millions of dollars in fines levied
against the aerospace contractor for federal contract fraud.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Plunkett last Wednesday denied
Sundstrand's motion to dismiss the case, ruling that the amended
complaint contained enough allegations to bypass the board of
directors and go to trial, the company said in a release Monday.
   Rockford-based Sundstrand pleaded guilty to fraud in October and
agreed to pay a $115 million fine _ the largest fraud settlement in
Defense Department history. Several managers were subsequently fired.
   The lawsuit, first filed in September by Rodney B. Shields of
Chandler, Ariz., and joined by several other shareholders, said
company board members and some officers should be personally liable
for the penalties.
   Plunkett approved Sundstrand's motion for dismissal of the case
in March, saying the plaintiffs had failed to give adequate reasons
for taking the case to court before submitting their claims to the
company board.
   But he left plaintiffs the option of amending the complaint.
   In last week's ruling, Plunkett denied the company's bid for
dismissal of the amended lawsuit, Sundstrand said.
   The government said Sundstrand overbilled the department for
aircraft parts and obtained contracts by underbidding actual costs
and attempting to recover them through overhead accounts set up for
other purposes.
   On Jan. 26, Sundstrand agreed to pay an additional $62.3 million
to the Pentagon and make cost-saving concessions on future contracts
that one federal official estimated could be worth an additional $34
million.

   The Dallas Times Herald won a temporary
restraining order barring its rival, The Dallas Morning News, from
publishing two dozen syndicated columns and comic strips beginning
next week.
   The question of who has publication rights to the features also
is under the scrutiny of a federal judge in Kansas City, where a
hearing was scheduled today.
   The features, including such items as ``Dear Abby'' and ``Tank
McNamara,'' would have disappeared from the Times Herald beginning
Sept. 3, had a contract obtained by the Morning News not been
challenged.
   Universal Press Syndicate, the Kansas City-based firm which
distributes the features, has sued the Times Herald under federal
copyright laws. A hearing on that suit is set for Friday.
   State District Judge David West in Houston said his restraining
order Monday could mean no Dallas newspaper will be carrying the
features and comics. ``Until the logjam is broken, that's what the
result is,'' he said.
   Last week, West declined to grant a similar temporary restraining
order sought by the Times Herald, citing an order by U.S. District
Judge D. Brook Bartlett that nothing be done to infringe the federal
judge's jurisdiction.
   At the Kansas City hearing today, attorneys for the Times Herald
were to seek to have Bartlett's order vacated, according to Times
Herald officials.
   The smaller Times Herald wants to prevent Morning News owner A.H.
Belo Corp. from acquiring exclusive Dallas-area rights to the 26
comics and features.
   Belo announced early this month it had formed a joint venture
with Universal Press to explore television programming possibilities
for some of the syndicate's features. As part of the agreement, Belo
_ which also owns Dallas' top-rated television station WFAA _
acquired exclusive rights to the syndicate's features.
   That prompted the suit from the Times Herald, which accused Belo
of unfairly increasing its influence in the Dallas market.
   Morning News attorney Paul Watler insisted the federal court's
jurisdiction should not be disturbed, but West said he felt he
needed to do something.
   ``I'm interested in the public rather than the parties,'' West
said. ``The public has a right to competing newspapers and has a
right to read these columns.''
   The legal actions are not the first involving the intense rivals.
Last year, the two newspapers settled a dispute over circulation
figures.
   According to Editor &amp; Publisher, the Morning News has a daily
circulation of 354,000 issues, to 224,000 for the Times Herald.

   Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and other
Muppets have been given the keys to the Disney castle, and will soon
join Mickey Mouse, Dumbo and the other regulars at Disney theme
parks.
   Later, Muppets will star in Disney movies and television shows.
   ``There is virtually no area in which there isn't an opportunity
for Jim Henson to make an enormous contribution,'' said Jeffrey
Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios.
   Henson, the creator of the Muppets, and the Walt Disney Co.
announced an agreement Monday to put at Disney's disposal all of the
existing Muppet characters and their library of film and television
shows.
   That's not mentioning ``what is to come, what will be created,''
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said.
   The merger of the two kiddie entertainment giants will blend the
colorful characters from ``The Muppet Show'' _ the most widely seen
TV program in the world with an estimated 235 million viewers in
some 100 countries _ into Disney's theme parks, movies, TV shows and
retail merchandising products.
   Katzenberg said the Muppets will be presented at the Disney-MGM
Studios theme park in a state-of-the-art ``interactive 3-D
experience. We will use many technologies in doing some things that
have never been done before.'' The Muppet theater will open next
Memorial Day.
   Henson and Eisner refused to disclose the purchase price of
Henson Associates Inc. It has been reported as ranging from $100
million to $150 million.
   ``I've loved Disney. I grew up on its movies. . . and I'm happy
to have the Muppets at the parks,'' said the bearded Henson, who
created Kermit in 1955 and followed that up with Miss Piggy, Animal,
Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter and others.
   Henson, who also created most of the stars of the ``Sesame
Street'' television series, will retain his association with that
show separately from the Disney agreement, he and Eisner told
reporters.
   Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, the Cookie Monster and other Henson
creations for ``Sesame Street'' are not part of the Disney deal.
   Analysts have said the studios' park needed something such as the
Muppets to better compete with rival Universal Studios Florida,
which will have two attractions geared to children when it opens
next May 1.
   Eisner and Henson publicist Susan Berry said the Muppets would
retain their family-oriented humor and not become strictly
children's characters. The Muppets' attraction to small children is
primarily visual, Ms. Berry said.
   ``Miss Piggy, for instance _ whose humor is adult humor _ is not
going to change,'' she said.
   Henson said he it was ``always fun creating new characters. . . I
look forward to that.''

   More agreements were reached in the Baby Belles,
with Bell Atlantic agreeing to tenative settlements with two
striking unions and Illinois Bell signing a pact with its strikers.
   Bell Atlantic union members, who were on strike for 23 days,
began reporting to wor telephone strikk today, but a utility official said
that
operations wouldn't return to normal for several days. The company
serves six states and the District of Columbia.
   Union officials in Illinois, meanwhile, urged members to stay out
until agreements are reached with Bell companies in Michigan and
Indiana. Two other Ameritech Bells in Ohio and Wisconsin reached
agreements with workers over the weekend.
   About 200,000 workers went on strike earlier this month at four
of the Baby Bells, the regional telephone companies created by the
1984 breakup of AT&amp;T. With the Bell Atlantic settlement and the one
reached earlier at Pacific Telesis on the West Coast, only NYNEX
Corp. and parts of Ameritech are strikebound.
   In New Yt that balances
the needs of the union and of the company. We expect to resume
discussions today, although no definite time's been set.''
   It was the same story in Indiana.
   ``We started the day looking pretty good, but then things took a
turn for the worse,'' said Estel Gibson, a spokesman for Indiana
Bell.
   At the New York rally, union members heard speeches by CWA
President Morton Bahr and other union leaders, then marched around
the section of the park where the U.S. Open was being played.
   The union was not trying to disrupt the games or keep people from
attending, said union spokesman Bob Masters.
   Talks involving NYNEX, the CWA and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers are to resume Wednesday.

   Prices dipped in early trading on Wall Street
today after the government revised upward its estimate of economic
growth in the second quarter.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 6.66 to 2,736.70 as of
10 a.m.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 5
to 4, with 368 stocks rising, 462 falling and 502 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume after the first half-hour of trading came to 19.26 million
shares.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of the economy's performance, grew by 2.7 percent
from April through July, a significant change from the 1.7 percent

<TEXT>
   U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists have
developed an infrared device that takes the guesswork out of buying
watermelons, cantaloupes and honeydews.
   After 16 years of research, Gerald Dull, a USDA chemist in
Athens, has unveiled a meter that measures the sugar content of
individual melons.
   ``The No. 1 parameter of quality is sweetness,'' Dull said in a
recent interview. ``If you haven't got sweetness, you haven't got a
good melon.''
   Growers and consumers currently have to rely on appearance in
judging ripeness and quality, Dull noted, but similar-looking melons
can vary from 5 percent to 10 percent in sweetness.
   ``There's no one who can look at the outside and tell you whether
that melon is good,'' he said.
   The melon meter shines infrared light into the top of the fruit
and then measures the amount of light that comes out the side. The
computerized device determines the amount of soluble solids, based
on the amount of light that is absorbed by the fruit.
   Dull said soluble solids are predominantly sugars.
   Doyle Smittle, a horticulturist at the University of Georgia's
Coastal Plain Experiment Station, said ripeness is critical because
melons can add a quarter of a pound of sugar in just a few days.
Sugar is produced during the photosynthesis process.
   Melons need a sugar content of at least 9 percent to taste good,
and the best contain 12 percent to 14 percent sugar.
   ``If you get one that is 7 or 8 percent, it's an unpleasant
experience,'' Dull said. ``It's kind of like eating a raw cucumber.''
   The melon meter is 85 percent accurate in the laboratory, and the
chemist is testing a portable version with hundreds of melons grown
under Smittle's supervision near Tifton.
   Dull developed the meter with help from USDA engineer Gerald
Birth, who recently retired. Another USDA scientist, physicist Dick
Leffler of Athens, is perfecting the computer program that will
analyze signals from the light detector and give a sweetness reading.
   Several companies have already expressed an interest in producing
melon meters, Dull said, and they probably will be installed
initially in packing sheds, where the fruit is graded, packed and
shipped.
   He believes they will appeal to suppliers who want to provide
consumers with the highest-quality melons.
   ``I think we're just opening the door'' on analyzing fresh
produce, he said. ``With computers and high-speed equipment, we
might be able to get down to (measuring) the vitamins.''

<HEAD>Pearson Interim Pretax Profit Up 4.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pearson PLC, the British conglomerate which
publishes the Financial Times, said Tuesday its profit rose about 6
percent in the first half of the year due mainly to strong trading
profits from its core businesses.
   In the six-month period ended June 30, Pearson's net earnings
rose to 54.9 million pounds, or $86.1 million, from 52 million
pounds.
   Pearson, which has interests in publishing, banking and fine
china, said earnings per share weakened 10 percent to 21.4 pence, or
33.5 cents, from 23.8 pence, in response to the issue of 14 million
new shares in the first half to help fund acquisitions.
   Following the earnings report, Pearson shares fell 16 pence, or
25 cents, to 7.94 pounds on the London Stock Exchange.
   Pearson did not break out quarterly results. It is not required
to do so under British law.
   Pearson said its board would recommend an interim dividend of 9
pence a share, up 20 percent from 7.5 pence a year earlier.
   Pearson Chairman Lord Blakenham said the company tends to earn
more of its profits in the second half of the year.
   Sales for the group climbed 29 percent to 641.4 million pounds,
or $1 billion, compared with 496.2 million pounds a year ago.
   Excluding property profits and businesses acquired or disposed of
in the last 18 months, Pearson said its trading profit advanced a
healthy 22 percent in the interim period compared with a year
earlier.
   Pearson reported particularly strong performances from investment
banking, fine china, and its printing and publishing businesses.
   Interest charges, however, jumped to 12.5 million pounds from 3.8
million pounds, reflecting rising acquisition costs.
   Pearson recently completed the acquisition of the Paris financial
daily newspaper Les Echos and raised its stake in the Dutch company
Elsevier NV to 22.5 percent. Pearson estimated that its stake in
Elsevier chipped in around 12 million pounds to trading profits.
   The operating profit growth from Pearson's investment banking
rose to 16.6 million pounds from 12.2 million pounds. Its book
publishing arm lost 1.5 million pounds compared with a profit of 9.6
million pounds last time.

   Prices were narrowly mixed on Wall Street today
as traders had little reaction to an upward revision in the second

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of
2.7 percent in the spring, significantly faster than previously
believed, the government said today in a report that further
dispelled recession fears.
   The Commerce Department said the increase in the gross national
product, the broadest measure of economic health, was a full
percentage point higher than its original estimate made a month ago.
   The initial report had put GNP growth in the April-June quarter
at an anemic 1.7 percent. That was the poorest performance in three
years and had increased fears that the economy could be facing an
imminent recession.
   However, more recent government statistics have shown that
economic activity in the second quarter was not as weak as
previously believed, prompting economists to put away their gloomy
forecasts of an impending downturn.
   In another report today, the Commerce Department said sales of
new homes shot up 14.4 percent in July, their biggest monthly
increase in almost three years. The gain, which put sales at an
annual rate of 739,000 units, was credited to the big drop in
mortgage rates which occurred during the month.
   Analysts said the exceptionally large upward revision in the GNP
and the strong home sales report showed that the economy was moving
ahead at a healthy clip in the seventh year of the current expansion.
   ``This is a clear indication, if anyone needed such assurance,
that this economy is not headed into a recession,'' said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The White House was sure to be cheered by the upward revision
since more robust economic growth makes it easier to meet the
administration's deficit-reduction goals.
   In more good news, today's GNP report showed that inflation did
not worsen even though growth was stronger than originally thought.
   An inflation gauge tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5.1
percent from April through June, down slightly from an original
estimate of 5.2 percent made a month ago. The increase in prices,
which followed a rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter, was
blamed on higher energy costs.
   Almost two-thirds of today's upward revision in growth came from
higher consumer spending than previously believed.
   Consumer purchases climbed at an annual rate of 2.2 percent,
double the previously reported rate.
   Other areas of strength were government purchases, which rose at
a rate of 12.3 percent, and spending for business investment, which
rose 8.2 percent.
   One remaining area of weakness was housing construction, which
fell 12.6 percent in the second quarter, the biggest decline since
the recession year of 1982.
   The administration is forecasting that the economy will expand by
2.9 percent this year, down from GNP growth of 4.4 percent in 1988,
the fastest pace in four years.
   To meet the administration's growth forecast, the economy would
have to expand at an annual rate of just 2.2 percent in the second
half of the year, a level that many economists believe is obtainable.
   The administration two weeks ago criticized the Federal Reserve
for keeping interest rates so high that they threatened to topple
the country into a recession.
   However, today's report was likely to strengthen the Fed's
resolve to keep rates about where they are now, given the business
signals showing that growth remains fairly robust.
   In another report today, the government said that corporate
profits after taxes fell a sharp 5.4 percent in the second quarter.
The decline, which followed a 1.1 percent drop in the first three
months of the year, was the biggest setback since a 16.5 percent
decline in the first quarter of 1986.
   Trade was another bright spot in the GNP report. The trade
deficit declined by $2.5 billion in the second quarter, reflecting
the fact that exports grew at a faster rate than imports.
   The 2.7 percent GNP growth rate in the second quarter followed a
3.7 percent increase in the first quarter. However, most of the
first-quarter advance stemmed from a rebound in the farm sector
following last summer's drought. The non-farm economy actually grew
at a lackluster 1.5 percent rate in the first quarter.
   The various changes in the GNP put the total output of goods and
services at an annual rate of $4.134 trillion in the second quarter,
after adjusting for inflation.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Little Changed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were little
changed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with
corn and soybeans up slightly and wheat futures a bit lower.
   The early gains in the corn and soybean markets reflected
followthrough buying from Monday's late comeback.
   Growing fears of an early frost in the Midwest also supported the
corn and soybean markets, said Jon Horton of Research Department
Inc., a Chicago-based market-analysis firm.
   The summer's unusually cool temperatures have prompted some
private meteorologists to declare a better-than-average chance of a
crop-damaging early frost in the Grain Belt.
   ``It could happen, and if it does, it will definitely affect the
beans and corn,'' Horton said. ``A lot of corn was late-planted this
year.''
   Wheat futures were weaker on expectations that a large number of
delivery notices will be posted Thursday against the soon-to-expire
September wheat contract.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.87{ a bushel; corn was \
cent to 2 cents higher with September at $2.33 a bushel; oats were {
cent to 1} cents higher with September at $1.35{ a bushel; soybeans
were { cent to 2{ cents higher with September at $5.78{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .48 cent higher with September
at 73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .23
cent higher with August at 83.45 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent
lower to .08 cent higher with October at 40.60 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .25 cent to .80 cent higher with February at 41.35
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Monday.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Say New Type of Auto Battery Will Revolutionize Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to get an edge in a highly
competitive market, two manufacturers are coming out with car
batteries they say will make jumper cables obsolete.
   Some industry analysts, however, are uncertain whether the
general public will be willing to invest in the costlier product.
   First to hit the market will be GNB Inc.'s Champion Switch
battery with an initial run of 500,000 going on sale in the
Southeast in October.
   Johnson Controls Inc., the nation's top auto battery maker, will
bring out its EverStart in early spring.
   The technology is different, but both batteries have a reserve
store of energy that cannot run down or be tapped unless a switch is
thrown under the hood.
   ``It's going to be a blockbuster,'' said Anita Clark, a
spokeswoman for Johnson Controls, a Milwaukee company that makes
batteries for some of the nation's largest retailers under their
house names.
   ``It's going to do for the battery industry what radial tires did
for the tire industry,'' she said.
   The suggested retail price for EverStart will be $129.95 while
Champion Switch carries the recommeded price of $109.99. The normal
range for car batteries is $60 to $80.
   Eli Lustgarten, a financial analyst in New York with Paine Webber
Inc., wonders how it will go over with the general public.
   ``It's nice to have reserve power, but you know, the question is
whether the consumer is going to pay for it,'' Lustgarten said.
``It's an interesting marketing technique, but I doubt if it will
revolutionize the market.''
   Both batteries are being introduced at the 1989 Automotive Parts
&amp; Accessories Association Show this week. The show, which is closed
to the public during its Monday through Thursday run, features 920
exhibitors for the trade in the $150 billion-a-year industry.
   Both companies say their batteries will fit about 70 percent of
the cars on the road.
   EverStart holds its power in reserve in a separate battery
packaged in the same shell as the main battery. The spare battery is
powerful enough to start cars with dead batteries, but is not
designed to run all the electrical accessories.
   Both batteries activate their spare power in the same fashion.
   ``If you drain the battery down, you just simply lift the hood
and there's a big yellow switch you turn on to activate the
reserve,'' said Bill Kennedy, head of marketing for GNB, a St. Paul,
Minn., company that has been making batteries for 70 years.
``There's ample cranking amperage in reserve to activate the car.''
   Lustgarten noted that most new cars have automatic light-shutoff
features or a warning signal to alert the motorist who leaves his
lights on _ a primary cause of dead batteries.
   ``But they're not failsafe, either,'' said Eric Smith, a
technical executive with GNB's holding company, Pacific Dunlop
International Battery Group of Australia.
   Lustgarten conceded that the new batteries will ``probably find a
successful nitch in the upper range of batteries.''.
   Whether they can replace batteries costing half as much is
another question.
   ``Sure, I'd like to have the added protection for free, but I
don't know if I'd want to pay for it,'' Lustgarten said.

   Federal regulators unveiled proposed rules
changes today to combat the alleged fraud and price manipulation
uncovered earlier this month in Chicago's commodity futures
exchanges.
   Among the changes proposed would be a stepped-up presence of
government regulators on exchange floors at the start and end of
trading days.
   More than 40 brokers and traders were indicted on a laundry list
of charges Aug. 2 after a two-year probe of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
futures industry, voted unanimously, 5-to-0 to submit a package of
rules changes for public comment.
   In addition to tightening surveillance on the nation's commodity
exchange floors, the package calls for better record keeping and
requires more accountability by individuals and firms.
   The proposed rules changes, if adopted, also would prevent
individuals with a previous history of rules violations from serving
on the governing boards, disciplinary committees or arbitration
panels of exchanges or registered futures associations.
   The proposed changes do not take effect immediately, but are
subject to comment by interested parties for the next 30 days before
final approval by the commission.
   ``The message is that the commission is very vigilant in its
efforts to ensure that these markets have integrity and have the
public confidence,'' CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm told reporters
after the commission voted to submit the proposed changes for
comment.
   A surveillance pilot program calls for direct examination of
trading cards and other trading records right on the exchange floor.
   ``Deterrence (of criminal activity) can be enhanced through
adequate record keeping,'' Andrea Corcoran, director of the CFTC's
Division of Trading and Markets told commission members at the
meeting.

<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. is expected to enter the
fray over an ingredient that purportedly reduces cholesterol on
Wednesday when it introduces its ``Heartwise'' cereal.
   Heartwise contains oat bran and psyllium, which is used in
General Mills' Benefit cereal. Psyllium is a grain grown mainly in
India. The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has
been shown to reduce cholesterol, the cereal makers claim.
   Promotion of Benefit by General Mills Inc., which also makes such
cereals as Cheerios, Wheaties and Lucky Charms, was challenged by
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which was ordered by the Food and Drug
Administration to refrain from advertising health claims for its
Metamucil laxative, which contains psyllium. Proctor &amp; Gamble
contends psyllium is a drug.
   Instead of declaring psyllium a drug _ which would force
companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures _ the FDA is
developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels.
   Kellogg, whose cereals include Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies, has
scheduled a news conference Wednesday in New York at which it says
experts in disease prevention will discuss cholesterol and a product
will be introduced.
   However, the company would not comment on reports in the trade
publication Advertising Age that it is expected to reiterate its
stand on making strong health claims for its products. Inquiries
were referred to Jeffrey L. Christmas of the New York public
relations firm of Hill and Knowlton, who said the company would not
confirm or deny the reports today.
   Heartwise, which will be targeted to consumers age 35 and older,
will reach stores this fall.

   Share prices declined Tuesday in thin trading on
the London Stock Exchange.
   Dealers said the downturn was set in motion when market players
trimmed prices in a bid to shake out sellers.
   Market sentiment also was hurt by a weak opening on Wall Street,
traders said. Several attempts to start a rally during the London
afternoon failed to gather momentum, they noted.
   ``There was very little corporate or economic news out today, and
I think the market's lackluster tone is likely to continue all
week,'' said one dealer.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 16.6
points, or 0.6 percent, lower at 2,380.8, down from the day's high
of 2,394.4. At its lowest, the index touched 2,378.5, a fall of 18.9
points.
   Volume was a slim 383.1 million shares, down from 431.2 million
traded on Friday. The London financial markets were closed Monday
for a bank holiday.
   At the close of trading, the narrower Financial Times 30-share
index was down 8.3 points at 1,972.7. The Financial Times-500 index
was 1,329.63, down 8.12.
   At the London close, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials in
New York was 7.23 points lower at 2,736.13.

<HEAD>Canadian Group Raises Hostile Bid for Dunkin' Donuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian partnership raised to $308 million
Tuesday its hostile bid for Dunkin' Donuts Inc. despite a lawsuit
pending in Delaware Chancery Court, officials said.
   DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Kingsbridge Capital Group
and Cara Operations Ltd., said it had raised its price to $45 a
share from $43, regardless of how the Delaware judge rules in the
trial that begins Sept. 11.
   Unless extended, the offer expires Sept. 15, the Toronto-based
partnership said.
   Dunkin' Donuts' board of directors, meanwhile, said it would meet
``to evaluate the revised tender offer with the assistance of the
company's outside legal and financial advisors''. In a statement,
the company urged shareholders not to act until officials had made
their recommendation.
   ``The offer is there and isn't contingent on success in court,''
said Eric W. Evans, a Kingsbridge associate director.
   He said DD Acquisition would continue its bid if the court finds
Dunkin' Donuts was within its rights when it set up a series of
tough defenses, including an employee stock ownership plan, which
holds about 16 percent of its outstanding common shares.
   The company also has a shareholder rights plan, or ``poison
pill,'' designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a
takeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive.
   And it has sold $28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an
11 percent stake in the company, to an avowedly friendly investor,
General Electric Capital Corp.
   ``We think we have a very good case in court and that the court
will find that those measures were improperly put in place. But even
if they weren't, we'll still continue with the bid,'' Evans said.
   He said the offer was, however, valid only if 50.1 percent of
Dunkin' Donuts' common shares were tendered.
   ``Based on publicly available financial information on Dunkin'
Donuts, including its results for the most recent quarter, we
believe this revised offer is generous and fair,'' Earl I. Rotman,
president of Kingsbridge, said in a statement.
   Dunkin' Donuts reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter
earnings, much of which it attributed to costs associated with
battling the hostile takeover bid.
   The doughnut shop chain reported earnings for the three months
ended July 29 of $2.1 million, or 24 cents a share, on revenue of
$30.3 million, compared with earnings of $3.2 million, or 49 cents a
share, on revenue of $29.2 million a year earlier.
   For the nine months ended July 29, Dunkin' Donuts' earnings
totaled $7.62 million, or $1.08 a share, on revenue of $89.7
million, down 22.7 percent from $9.86 million, or $1.49 a share, on
revenue of $82.4 million for the same period a year earlier.

   Soybean futures prices closed moderately higher in
light trading Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by a
government report showing less improvement in the U.S. soybean crop
than traders had expected.
   Wheat futures closed lower amid expectations that a large number
of delivery notices will be posted Thursday against the
soon-to-expire September contract, and corn futures finished nearly
unchanged.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly crop condition report,
released late Monday, showed less improvement in the soybean crop
last week than traders had expected, given the amount of rain that
fell in the Midwest during the period.
   The government said the portion of soybeans in fair condition
rose to 52 percent from 46 percent but the change in the ``good''
and ``excellent'' categories was negligible.
   ``The market thought it would be a little better than it came
out; that's what you got most of your buying off of today,'' said
Jon Horton of Research Department Inc., a market analysis firm based
in Chicago.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 4\ cents lower to 2 cents

<HEAD>Major Marketer of Car Coolant Announces Program to Protect Ozone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IG-LO Products, maker of a coolant for car air
conditioners that is linked to depletion of the earth's protective
ozone layer, on Tuesday announced a recycling and consumer-education
program to help address the problem.
   ``Ultimately, we hope this program will help to move the
marketplace toward less dependence upon CFC-12 in particular, and
toward a gradual, total phase-out of this environmentally harmful
chemical,'' said Hoyt B. Wilder, company president, during a news
conference at the 1989 Automotive Parts and Accessories Show.
   Under the program, recycling units are to be established at
service centers by mid-1990 to capture escaped particles of the
CFC-12 coolant, known as Freon, and allow them to be reused.
   The chemical breakup of CFC-12 and other chlorofluorocarbons _
``CFCs'' _ in the earth's upper atmosphere has been linked to the
depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer and the warming of
the atmosphere known as the ``greenhouse effect.''
   IG-LO also plans to eliminate inexpensive ``do-it-yourself''
coolant-injection kits with a high potential for misuse.
   They are to be replaced by ``deluxe diagnostic kits'' costing
about five times more and designed for the sophisticated car owner,
considered more likely to follow directions aimed at protecting the
environment. The new kits are expected to go on the market in
January 1991.
   IG-LO hopes elimination of the $4 to $5 kits will send users to
service centers that will eventually use the recycling units, Wilder
said.
   The company also plans to invest $1 million in a
consumer-education program designed to promote proper use and
recycling of CFC-12. Displays in retail stores and public service
announcements are planned.
   Scientists say CFCs are non-toxic when released into the
atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15 to 20 miles
to the stratosphere, their chemical bonds break apart, resulting in
damage to the ozone layer.
   Environmentalists say car air conditioners are among the nation's
single biggest source of ozone depletion.
   IG-LO, a Lexington, Ky.-based division of Valvoline Oil Co.,
bills itself as the nation's leading marketer of automotive
refrigerant.
   Under an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol,
the United States and 37 other countries are committed to a 50
percent reduction in production and consumption of CFC's by 1998.
   Wilder said his industry is hoping for ``a total phase-out'' of
CFC-containing coolants by the turn of the century.
   The industry may be forced to address the question sooner than
that, as several states and Congress are considering restrictions or
bans on CFC-containing products, said David Gardiner, legislative
director for the Sierra Club.
   The Sierra Club, an environmental group based in San Francisco,
is lobbying to phase out the use of CFCs completely by 1995,
Gardiner said in a telephone interview from his Washington, D.C.,
office.
   IG-LO's new program ``sounds basically good,'' Gardiner said.
   ``Certainly the recycling thing is a good thing to do. With
something like 100 million cars on the road today ... unless we do
something, that's potentially the biggest source of
chlorofluorocarbons.''

<HEAD>Consumers to Get Refunds for Recalled Toy Gun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manufacturer has agreed to give refunds to
people who bought a pistol-shaped juice container for children that
has been recalled, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday.
   Mackie International Inc., based in Santa Fe Springs, Calif.,
reached an agreement with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission early this month to recall the toy, called Chilly Bang
Bang. It had sold 578,688 of them in New York between April and June.
   The federal and state agreements were based on a plastic piece on
the toy that could choke young children. However, the company agreed
to discontinue sales on June 2 because of complaints about teaching
children to put guns in their mouths.
   The agreement released by the attorney general's office said the
product's wrapper pictures a boy with the barrel of the Chilly Bang
Bang in his mouth, and the directions, ``Twist Tip of Barrel.
Squeeze and Drink!''
   A three-eighths of an inch, plastic piece must be removed from
the barrel before drinking the liquid inside.
   ``This plastic piece is easily broken off the barrel when twisted
or bitten by a child,'' the attorney general's office said. ``This
circular plastic piece, because of its size, can be aspirated by a
child under the age of three and thus presents a choking hazard.''
   After the soft drink is gone, the container can be used as a
water gun.
   Mackie, which admitted no wrongdoing, has agreed to immediately
stop selling or distributing Chilly Bang Bang in New York.
   It also will direct its wholesale customers to pull the product
from their shelves; display a poster about the choking hazard; run
advertisements in local papers; and give refunds to customers who
return the product. Leslie Gersing, a spokesman for the attorney
general's office, said those provisions were not included in the
federal agreement.
   Mackie also must file an affidavit in 180 days detailing its
compliance with the New York agreement.
   The product also was sold in California, Michigan, Mississippi
and Pennsylvania.

   The dollar fell sharply in active trading Tuesday
despite favorable government reports on the economy.
   Gold prices rose as a result.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $363.60 a troy ounce, up $3.60 from late Monday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of
$362 an ounce, up $3.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's selloff in the United
States and abroad largely to sentiment that the U.S. currency had
been overbought. Many traders stocked up on dollars Monday in
anticipation of a favorable revision to the second-quarter gross
national product report, which is the broadest measure of economic
growth.
   The government said Tuesday that the economy grew at a healthy
2.7 percent annual rate in the spring. The GNP revision was far
higher than the previously estimated 1.7 percent rate but also in
line with market expectations.
   ``You buy on rumor and sell on fact,'' said Robert Ryan, a senior
currency trader for Irving Trust Co. in New York. ``What happened
was the market just squared up and dumped.''
   In another positive economic report Tuesday, the government said
sales of new homes shot up 14.4 percent in July, the biggest monthly
gain in almost three years.
   Currency dealers say they are now awaiting data on July factory
orders, August unemployment and the July index of leading
indicators, which are three of several other reports due out this
week.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.13 Japanese yen to a closing 144.15 yen. It was
quoted lower in London at 143.90 yen, and in New York at 143.01 yen,
down from 144.52 yen late Monday.
   The dollar declined against the British pound. It cost $1.5845 to
buy one pound in London, up from $1.5635 late Monday in Europe.
Sterling fetched $1.5870 in New York, more than $1.5636 late Monday.
   The financial markets were closed Monday in London for a bank
holiday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.9362 West German marks, down from 1.9638; 1.6704 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6925; 6.5285 French francs, down from 6.6160;
1.1754 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1717; and 1,391.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,406.375.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, included:
1.9375 West German marks, down from 1.9650; 1.6685 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6940; 6.5325 French francs, down from 6.6180; 2.1940
Dutch guilders, down from 2.2130; 1.1724 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1753; and 1,396.00 Italian lire, down from 1,408.00.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $364.00 an ounce compared
with late Friday's $360.45. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold closed at
$360.75 an ounce, up from $359.25 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.29 to close at $360.82 an
ounce.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery rose to $5.091 a troy ounce from $5.090 late Monday. Silver
rose in London to $5.15 an ounce from Friday's $5.13.

   Oil futures prices ended mixed Tuesday in another

   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
closed flat at $18.64 per 42-gallon barrel after a gain of 13 cents
in Monday's session. Contracts for later delivery closed lower.
   Refined products traded on the exchange posted slight gains. The
September contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline added 0.96 cent
to finish at 54.61 cents a gallon, and home heating oil for
September delivery rose 0.45 cent to close at 52.17 cents a gallon.
   Other contract months for both products were mostly higher.
   Analysts said volume picked up only slightly from Monday's
turtle-like pace, with no new developments to move the market.
   Monday's activity was the slowest of the year, with only about
21,000 crude oil contracts traded, representing 1,000 barrels per
contract. Tuesday's volume rose to about 38,000, said Evan Baron,
senior account executive with Elders Futures Inc. Normal trading
volume is about 65,000.

<HEAD>Merger Expected Between Stellar And Japanese-Backed Ardent</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: News conference is scheduled for 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Stellar Computer Inc. and its Japanese-backed
rival, Ardent Computer Corp., are expected to announce a merger
Wednesday of two of the top makers of expensive graphics
minisupercomputers, according to sources close to the deal.
   The companies, which normally steer clear of each other, have
called a news conference Wednesday in New York that will be attended
by chief executives of both companies.
   Sources close to the deal said both privately held companies are
losing money and are hoping that by uniting they will be able to
stave off mounting competition from other rivals, particularly
Silicon Graphics Inc.
   Computers made by Ardent and Stellar have list prices of roughly
$100,000 and can be used by only one person at a time, usually a
highly paid scientist or engineer, so they have a limited market.
Sales of each company are about $20 million a year.
   Graphics minisupercomputers are used for jobs that require heavy
calculation and detailed, three-dimensional displays, such as
analyzing the way air flows over turbine blades in jet engines or
the molecular structure of pharmaceuticals.
   Ardent and Stellar are remarkably similar, both founded a month
apart at the end of 1985 and both having about 210 employees. The
biggest difference is that Ardent has the backing of Japan's Kubota
Ltd., a maker of tractors and industrial equipment, which is a more
patient investor than most American venture capitalists.
   Kubota owns about 44 percent of Ardent. It was not clear Tuesday
how much it will own of the combined companies.
   A source familiar with the deal said the combined company
probably would try to save money by merging the two product lines,
combining the chip design used by Ardent with the graphics system
used by Stellar. That could be bad for Stellar's current customers,
because their software would not run on the Ardent chip.
   Stellar is based in Newtown, Mass., and is headed by J. William
Poduska, its founder, chairman and chief executive. He previously
co-founded Prime Computer Inc. and Apollo Computer Inc.
   Ardent Computer Corp., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has Allen H.
Michels as its president and chief executive. Michels is founder and
former president of Convergent Technologies Inc., which is now part
of Unisys Corp.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Collapse On Signs Of Easing Miners' Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices collapsed Tuesday, possibly spelling the
end of a dramatic month-long rally amid signs that copper miners'
strikes in Canada and Peru may be nearing settlement.
   On other markets, frozen pork-belly futures soared the permitted
daily limit on rumors of a possible deal to send bacon meat to
Poland; coffee futures rallied for a second day; grains and soybeans
were mixed; and oil futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 7.15 cents to 7.7 cents lower on New
York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in
September at $1.28 a pound.
   ``The market just ran out of people who wanted to buy it,'' said
Craig Sloane, a metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
in New York. ``It had gotten pretty high.''
   Copper futures contracts had risen more than 22 percent in value
from July 31 through last Friday, when the bull move peaked with the
September contract at $1.368 a pound.
   The rally had been fueled by fears of tight supplies, based
largely on strikes at the Highland Valley Copper Co.'s Highland
Valley mine in British Columbia and a nationwide Peruvian copper
miners' strike that began on Aug. 14.
   But supply fears eased Tuesday after Highland Valley confirmed it
had resumed negotiations with workers aimed at settling a 56-day-old
strike and Peru's second-largest copper mine was reported operating
at full capacity following a failed attempt to expand the copper
strike into a general work stoppage.
   The market had begun its downhill run earlier in the day after
the London Metal Exchange announced in a weekly report that stocks
of copper warehoused for delivery against LME futures contracts had
risen by 3,325 tons last week to 80,625. Traders had expected the
report to show a slight decrease.
   Analysts said copper prices were ripe for a downturn.
   ``The market had rallied so sharply ... it needed a correction or
some profit-taking,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in
New York, said the move had created a technical chart formation
known as a ``two-day island top,'' which frequently signals the end
of a bull run.
   ``This could be just a long overdue correction to an overbought
situation, but then again it could indicate a top,'' said Savaiko.
   In precious-metals trading on the Comex, gold settled $3.20 to
$4.20 higher with October at $365.50 a troy ounce; silver was
unchanged to .02 cent lower with September at $5.093 a troy ounce.
   Frozen pork-belly futures skyrocketed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on unconfirmed rumors that the Bush administration was
looking to ship surplus U.S. pork bellies to Poland.
   The nation's stockpile of frozen pork bellies, the part of the
hog from which bacon is made, has been running at near-record levels
all year, and pork-belly prices dipped earlier this month to about
24 cents a pound, a 17-year low.
   The runup in pork-belly prices spilled over to the livestock
futures markets.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .53 cent higher with September at
73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .45 cent higher
with September at 82.87 cents a pound; live hogs were .53 cent to
1.05 cents higher with October at 41.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with February at 43.10
cents a pound.
   Coffee futures rose sharply for a second day on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, where analysts said the market was
due for a technical correction.
   Coffee settled 1.57 cents to 3.13 cents higher with September at
85.38 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures finished moderately higher in light trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by a government report showing
less improvement in the U.S. soybean crop than traders had expected.
   Wheat futures closed lower amid expectations that a large number
of delivery notices will be posted Thursday against the
soon-to-expire September contract, and corn futures finished nearly
unchanged.
   Wheat settled 4 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September at
$3.84{ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1\ cents higher with
September at $2.32 a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher
with September at $1.34{ a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to 7{

   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil was unchanged to 12 cents lower with September at $17.77 a
barrel; heating oil was .03 cent lower to .49 cent higher with
September at 52.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .60 cent
lower to .75 cent higher with September at 54.40 cents a gallon.

   The stock market declined broadly Tuesday in a
session first lacking in direction but later dominated by program
traders.
   Airline issues moved up sharply, boosted by continued takeover
speculation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.73 to 2,726.63.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a margin of about
4-to-3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 869 down, 640 up and 486 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 175.21 million
shares, up from 131.18 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 205.52 million shares.
   Prices drifted in a narrow range until the early afternoon, when
program traders moved into the market and began selling. The Dow
Jones industrial average skidded about 38 points before stabilizing
late in the session.
   ``There was no real driving thrust other than the programs,''
said market analyst Dennis Jarrett of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``It did kick the stuffing out of the turkey,'' he said of the
programmed selloff.
   The market shrugged off the Commerce Department's report that the
gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's
performance, grew by 2.7 percent from April through July, a
significant change from the 1.7 percent growth rate originally
reported last month. The news eased fears that the economy was
slipping into a recession.
   The report also contained good news about inflation. A
closely-watched gauge tied to the GNP indicated inflation did not
worsen during the second quarter despite the strength in the economy.
   But the GNP report ``was a non-event'' on Wall Street, said
analyst Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said many traders
stayed on the sidelines awaiting Friday's release of unemployment
figures for August. The financial markets will look at the numbers
for clues on whether the Federal Reserve might relax interest rates.
   Airline stocks were the stars of the session. AMR, the parent of
American Airlines, was rumored to be a takeover target and shot up
10\ to 91{ as investors scooped up the company's stock before a
possible bid could emerge. Delta Air Lines was also up, rising 2{ to
83.
   However the parent of United Airlines, UAL, which is fighting an
unwanted bid from investor Marvin Davis, tumbled 4\ to 277\.
   Drug stocks were active after the Food and Drug Administration
said Monday it would withdraw approval for a generic version of the
blood-pressure medicine Dyazide manufactured by Bolar Pharmaceutical
Co.
   Bolar skidded 6} to 19{ in American Stock Exchange trading, but
other drug companies, including those selling competing brands of
Dyazide, were up. SmithKline Beecham rose 1 to 42} on the NYSE.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Texas Utilities,
off [ at 31}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $15.313 billion, or 0.45
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.98 to 194.47.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.47 to 401.06, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index slipped 2.25 to 349.84.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.62 to 466.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 380.94, down 0.73.

<HEAD>Sundstrand Chairman Retires But Will Remain on Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don R. O'Hare, chairman of Sundstrand
Corp.'s board of directors, is retiring as an employee and company
officer, the aerospace contractor announced Tuesday.
   O'Hare, 67, will remain chairman of the board.
   ``In order to assist in the orderly transition of management and
respnsibilities, Mr. O'Hare will act as a consultant to Harry C.
Stonecipher, president and chief executive officer of the company,
for one year beginning October 1989 and will continue as a member of
the board of directors serving as its chairman,'' the company said
in a statement.
   O'Hare started as an engineering and marketing trainee for
Sundstrand in 1950. He rose through the ranks, and was appointed
chairman of the board on Jan. 1.
   His retirement is not related to Sunstrand's legal problems, said
spokesman Claude Vernam.
   ``Absolutely not related at all,'' said Vernam. ``He's 67, which
makes him two years beyond the normal retirement date.''
   Sundstrand, based in this northern Illinois city, pleaded guilty
to federal contract fraud last October and agreed to pay a $115
million fine _ the largest fraud settlement in Defense Department
history. Several managers were subsequently fired.
   The government said Sundstrand overbilled the department for
aircraft parts and obtained contracts by underbidding actual costs
and attempting to recover them through overhead accounts set up for
other purposes.
   On Jan. 26, Sundstrand agreed to pay an additional $62.3 million
to the Pentagon and make cost-saving concessions on future contracts
that one federal official estimated could be worth an additional $34
million.

   Du Pont Co. reported an 8 percent
reduction in toxic air emissions and a 45 percent drop in toxic
water emissions in 1988 from its more than 80 plants and refineries
located around the country.
   In a statement Tuesday about its report to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency on 1988 emissions, the company said the drop
occurred despite a 5 percent increase in production from a year
earlier.
   Land disposal increased 17 percent, Du Pont said. Ninety-eight
percent of land disposal is to deep wells on Du Pont property using
special geologic formations about a mile below the earth's surface.
   Increases in land disposal were for ammonium sulfate,
hydrochloric acid and metal salts, said Bruce Karrh, Du Pont vice
president for safety, health and environmental affairs.
   Du Pont's total waste management program calls for reductions of
process wastes from 1982 to 1990, plus at least the same amount
during the next decade.

<HEAD>Founder and Chairman of True Value Hardware Chain Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John M. Cotter, who started out as a clerk
in a Minnesota hardware store and founded the True Value Hardware
chain, has died of cancer.
   Cotter, a resident of this north Chicago suburb, died Monday. He
was 85.
   Born in St. Paul, Minn., he worked as a hardware store clerk as a
boy, and as a department manager and buyer after high school. He
moved to Chicago in the early 1940s.
   He started his first store and distribution center, Cotter &amp; Co.,
in 1948, and began to revolutionize the idea of a ``dealer-owned''
wholesaler. In its first year, the company had sales of $385,000 and
25 dealers.
   Today, nearly one in four hardware stores in the United States
belong to Cotter's organization, which he served as chairman.
   ``He had a lot of vision when he started Cotter Co. In 40 years,
he made it a $2 billion business,'' said his son, Daniel. He added,
``He was also a heck of a father.''
   True Value sales exceed $2 billion, and membership includes more
than 6,000 True Value stores and 2,000 V&amp;S Variety stores. The
company also owns 15 distribution centers, an outdoor
power-equipment factory and two paint factories.
   Cotter is survived by his wife, Alice; another son, Michael;
daughters Mary Fee and Patti Kiggins; and eight grandchildren.

<HEAD>Judge Keeps Supermarket Merger on Hold For Supreme Court Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $2.5 billion merger of the Lucky and Alpha
Beta supermarket chains was kept on hold Tuesday by a judge who
allowed the California attorney general to post a nominal $10,000
bond while appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the
merger.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon said he believes, along with
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, that the state has a
good chance to win its fight to block the merger.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp contends that
reduced competition from the merger would cost California shoppers
$400 million a year. American Stores Inc. of Salt Lake City, which
owns both chains, says increased efficiency from the consolidation
would save customers $50 million to $60 million a year.
   Kenyon said the evidence so far indicates that the merger of the
supermarket giants _ Lucky is the state's biggest chain, Alpha Beta
the fourth-largest _ would cause irreparable harm to consumers.
   Although he earlier ordered a $16.2 million bond, Kenyon said the
case has changed radically in recent weeks and that the $8 million
bond proposed by American Stores was unnecessary.
   He alluded to briefs filed by Chief Deputy Attorney General
Andrea Sheridan Ordin, who said the state could afford a $10,000
bond and no more to ensure that the litigation goes forward.
   Attorney Frank Rothman, representing American Stores, argued that
the company would lose millions if the lawsuit was delayed further
and if, ultimately, the Supreme Court refused to review it.
   In her ruling last week, O'Connor said there was a fair prospect
the appeal would succeed before the high court. But she later
ordered Van de Kamp to post a reasonable bond.
   Alpha Beta and Lucky, which have a total of 550 stores, plan to
combine their operations under the Lucky banner.
   The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger. But Van de
Kamp, in a suit claiming violation of federal antitrust law,
contended that the merged chain would dominate the marketplace in
many areas and lead to higher prices.

<HEAD>Treasury Official Says U.S. Leadership Reduced Taxes Worldwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leadership by the United States has helped
reduce income taxes all over the world, a Treasury official said
Tuesday.
   Bruce Bartlett, deputy assistant secretary for economic policy,
compiled a list of 86 countries, showing that 55 have lowered their
top rates since 1985. Only two _ Lebanon and Luxembourg _ have
increased them. The 29 others have kept the same rate.
   Some have enacted reductions that have not yet gone into effect,
he added.
   In Japan, the highest rate has gone down to 50 percent from 70
percent, and in France to 56.8 percent from 60 percent. Britain
remained steady at 60 percent. Bartlett pointed out that Britain's
reductions had started earlier, from higher rates than in the United
States.
   Italy went down to 50 percent from 65 percent.
   ``There's no way of explaining these policies except by the
leadership of the United States,'' he said in an interview.
   The top U.S. rate went down to 28 percent from 50 percent.
   He called rates over 50 percent ``confiscatory,'' saying, ``they
only serve to justify high rates on lower incomes.''
   ``When someone with a low income pays 25 percent, it's consoling
to think that the fellow with millions is paying 90 percent,''
Bartlett said.
   He said high rates encourage people and money to leave a country,
discourage effort and do not increase total revenues.
   The southern African republic of Zambia, one of the world's
poorest countries, has the highest top rate of the 86 on his list.
It dropped only to 75 percent from the 80 percent of 1985. The
average Zambian earned $240 in 1987.
   Bartlett cautioned that the top rate is applied to very different
incomes in different countries. In Mexico, for example, the 40
percent rate is charged on incomes over $13,170. In Honduras, almost
next door, that is also the top rate, but it is applied only on
incomes of $500,000 in a country where the average income in 1987
was $780.
   ``You should get as close as possible to a flat rate,'' Bartlett
said, adding that he would favor a flat rate for the United States.
   A flat rate charges the same percentage against all income, high
or low. The U.S. system was designed as a progressive tax, based on
the taxpayer's ability to pay, with higher rates on higher incomes.
   Bartlett praised Bolivia, where he said the 10 percent rate _ the
lowest on his list _ is a flat rate.
   Many governments, unlike the United States, rely for their
revenues more on sales taxes than on income taxes.
   He pointed out that his figures do not include social security
taxes, taxes for health services and local income taxes. The top
federal rate in Canada, for example, is only 29 percent but in
Quebec the total tax burden can reach 49.1 percent, he calculated.
   His figures were drawn from tax guides issued by two
international accounting firms, Price Waterhouse and Coopers and
Lybrand. They were first published in a table in Tuesday's Wall
Street Journal.

<HEAD>Founder Of KKR, World's Largest Buyout Firm, Sues Former Partners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the founders of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., the world's largest corporate buyout firm, sued his former
partners Tuesday, claiming they enriched themselves at his expense.
   In a 23-page complaint filed in New York Supreme Court, the
state's trial-level court, Jerome Kohlberg Jr. alleges that Henry R.
Kravis and George R. Roberts sharply cut back on his stake in
several companies they had acquired jointly through the New York
firm.
   ``We are saddened that Mr. Kohlberg felt it necessary to sue his
partners and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,'' a spokesman for Kravis and
Roberts told The New York Times. ``We believe he is wrong both as to
the facts and his interpretation of the agreement between us, and we
fully expect to prevail in court.''
   Kohlberg, 64, resigned in 1987 from the firm he helped found in
1976, citing philosophical differences with his former partners. He
remained a limited partner in the firm, which removed him from
managerial duties but enabled him to continue to participate as an
investor in KKR deals.
   Kohlberg's suit contends his former partners used the opportunity
presented by several refinancings of old deals to declare them new
transactions under the terms of their agreement and to reduce his
ownership position.
   Kohlberg charges that in doing so, his former partners have
breached their ethical and fiduciary duties.
   His suit also suggests that his former partners identified
certain deals that were lucrative and then increased their stake in
those deals at the expense of investors whose money they were
managing.
   KKR's investors include a number of state and corporate pension
funds, who might feel they also were shortchanged should Kohlberg's
accusations be found true.
   Kohlberg now runs his own investment firm.
   KKR has raised billions of dollars for corporate takeovers. Its
most spectacular deal was the $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc., completed earlier this year. The deal was the largest
ever.
   In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the target company are used
as collateral to raise the money needed to buy all the firm's stock,
transforming it into a private company.

   A federal judge has rejected a complaint filed by
Texas Air Corp. alleging that United Airlines' contracts governing
travel agents' use of its computerized reservations system violated
antitrust laws, United officials said Tuesday.
   In a decision handed down Monday, U.S. District Judge Milton
Pollack of New York dismissed the claims of Texas Air's System One
computerized reservations system that United exercised monopoly
power and acted in restraint of trade in its contracts with 21
travel agencies, United said.
   Telephone calls late Tuesday to Charlotte Kirk, a spokeswoman for
Houston-based System One, were not returned.
   In his decision, Pollack noted that ``the record bears no
evidence of any substance that United's Apollo (computerized
reservations system) contracts and marketing practices suppress or
destroy competition, control prices or otherwise constitute an
unreasonable restraint on trade.''
   Texas Air, parent of Continental and Eastern Airlines, identified
12 cities, including Denver and Honolulu, in which United's Apollo
system has a leading share of the market, but Pollack said there
were no anti-competitive practices by United in those markets.
   ``United is delighted that the court has spoken so clearly and
forcefully to validate the legality of our contracts to provide
computerized reservations services to retail travel agents,'' said
Edward H. Hoenicke, United's senior vice president and general
counsel. United is a division of Chicago-based UAL Corp.
   Reservations systems are a key marketing tool since an airline
can influence which carrier's flights show up first on a travel
agent's computer screen if they own the system.

<HEAD>Agreement Will Get WPPSS Back To The Bond Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement announced Tuesday will allow
the Washington Public Power Supply System to proceed with a
temporarily derailed sale of $450 million in bonds.
   The sale is expected to take place the week of Sept. 11, said a
news release from WPPSS, the Bonneville Power Administration and
Chemical Bank of New York.
   The sale had been scheduled for last week. However, Chemical Bank
claimed in an 11th-hour memo it had a lien on proceeds from the
bonds and the sale was postponed.
   WPPSS estimates it could save $70 million to $80 million a year
over 30 years by refinancing high-interest bonds through the new
bonds. The $450 million is a first installment of the plan to
eventually refinance some $2 billion worth of bonds bearing interest
rates of 10 to 15 percent.
   WPPSS hopes to sell the new bonds at interest rates of 7 to 8
percent.
   Until this year, WPPSS had been effectively barred from
approaching the bond market because of a 1983 default on $2.25
billion worth of bonds sold to finance WPPSS nuclear power projects
Nos. 4 and 5. It was the largest default in municipal bond history.
   The supply system lost its bond ratings after the default, though
it continued to make bond payments, with the help of the Bonneville
Power Administration, on bonds sold to finance its other three
nuclear power plants, Nos. 1, 2 and 3.
   WPPSS regained bond ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and
Moody's Investors Service Inc., the two main credit-rating agencies,
after a trial last year tentatively resolved the default case.
   The $450 million sale is on bonds sold to finance WPPSS plants
Nos. 1 and 3. Those plants are ``twins'' of the defaulted plants,
Nos. 4 and 5, and there is a separate legal action over joint
financing of those plants called the ``cost sharing'' case. As
``twins,'' the plants shared certain mechanical systems.
   Chemical Bank, as trustee for WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5 bondholders,
claims some costs for Nos. 1 and 3 were inappropriately billed to
Nos. 4 and 5.
   The agreement announced Tuesday was formalized in an order signed
by U.S. District Judge William Browning of Tucson, Ariz., who has
been hearing the WPPSS cases. The agreement provides for Chemical
Bank to release any claim against proceeds of the refinancing sale.
   In return, Bonneville agreed to a stronger guarantee that it
would pay any settlement eventually ordered in the cost-sharing case.
   Under a complicated arrangement, BPA has essentially assumed the
WPPSS debts on plants 1, 2 and 3. It did not assume responsibility
for the debts on Nos. 4 and 5.
   Tuesday's agreement does not affect or settle the cost-sharing
litigation. WPPSS attempted to build five nuclear power plants in
the 1970s. One plant, No. 2, located at the Hanford nuclear
reservation in southcentral Washington, is operating. Nos. 1 and 3
were mothballed unfinished and there is little likelihood they will
be completed. Nos. 4 and 5 were abandoned after the $2.25 billion
had been invested.
