   A sheriff who came out against semiautomatic
weapons found his fears borne out only hours later when a gunman cut
a bloody path through his district, killing two people and wounding
three, including two deputies.
   During Thursday's rampage by a man wielding a semiautomatic
MAC-11 machine pistol, Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan again
lashed out at the sale of such weapons.
   ``Our officers are out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns
are designed to kill and maim people,'' he said.
   He held up a blood-stained revolver one of his deputies had used
against Thursday's suspect, and said the deputy was totally
out-gunned.
   Sullivan said the MAC-11 can hold 32 rounds and fire 10 times
faster than the standard .38-caliber pistol issued to all deputy
sheriffs.
   Deputies said 20-year-old Eugene Thompson Jr. went on a 12-hour
rampage in which he abducted a woman, killed her and her
mother-in-law, raped another woman, shot two police officers, shot a
hostage in the back and then killed himself Thursday, ending 12
hours of terror.
   In his position paper issued Wednesday, Sullivan said, ``I am a
western Coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and I don't want to
see anything that would hurt sport hunting. But we have to do
something about these weapons of war.''
   Sullivan said laws should be tightened to control who can buy
such weapons, and if they can't be controlled, he urged the Colorado
Legislature to pass a law to ban their sale.
   In his paper, Sullivan cited the January shooting in Stockton,
Calif., in which five children were killed and 29 children and a
school teacher were wounded by a man carrying a copy of the
Chinese-made AK-47 semiautomatic rifle.
   ``This tragic event has stimulated city, county, state and
federal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons of
war,'' Sullivan said.
   The California Assembly has approved a ban on 40 types of
assault-type weapons, and similar bills are pending in other states.
The Bush Administration temporarily has banned the import of
semiautomatic assault rifles.
   Sullivan's paper said that although the Constitution gives
citizens the right to import, manufacture, sell and possess
semiautomatic weapons, there is also ``a burden to place some
reasonable controls on these weapons of war without abridging the
sportsman's right to legitimate sporting rifles.''
   ``I do not propose their absolute ban, but simply to bring them
under the same or similar controls'' as machine guns, silencers,
sawed-off rifles, sawed-off shotguns, anti-tank guns, bazookas,
mortars, and caneguns, he said.
   Included in his list of weapons to be restricted are the MAC-10
and MAC-11, the gun used in Thursday's attacks.
   Sullivan said recent raids in Arapahoe County have netted a fully
automatic AK-47, a fully automatic MAC-10 with a silencer, an AR-15
and a semi-automatic shotgun.

   A man named Noid who believed he was the
target of Domino's Pizza's ``Avoid the Noid'' advertising, was ruled
mentally incompetent Wednesday to stand trial for holding two
Domino's employees hostage.
   Kenneth Lamar Noid, 22, of Albany, Ga., could be tried later
under an order entered by Superior Court Judge Curtis Tillman. For
the next 90 days, he is to be evaluated by the state Department of
Human Resources.
   The department ``will decide whether he's likely to become
competent,'' DeKalb County Public Defender Larry Schneider said.
``We don't know at this point what Mr. Noid's prospects are.''
   Police said Noid apparently believed that the advertising
campaign, which features a mischievous animated character called
``The Noid,'' was directed at him.
   He held two hostages at gunpoint for nearly six hours Jan. 30 at
a Domino's Pizza outlet in Chamblee, east of Atlanta, and at one
point fired four shots into the ceiling. The hostages finally
escaped when he turned his back.
   During the standouff, Noid demanded $100,000, a getaway car and a
science fiction novel. He also ordered and ate a pizza.
   Chamblee Police Chief Reed Miller said Noid told police that he
thinks Tom S. Monaghan, owner of the Detroit-based pizza chain and
the Detroit Tigers baseball team, ``comes into his apartment and
looks around.''
   A grand jury indicted Noid on two counts of aggravated assault,
two counts of false imprisonment, one count of possessing a firearm
in the commission of a crime and one count of attempted theft by
deception.

   Corn is king in this small town, but
officials have turned a deaf ear on a proposal to feature the
vegetable in a new city logo.
   Officials met Tuesday at a table lined with corn-emblazoned
coffee mugs that city Administrator Phillip H. Belcher said could be
used to help promote Auburn.
   But leaders opted for a contest to create an easier-to-swallow
emblem, Belcher said.
   ``We're trying to get a little more notoriety,'' he said, adding
that many people never heard of the farming community of 1,900
residents.
   Officials in the town 100 miles north of Detroit will work with
schools this fall to come up with a new logo for road signs,
promotions and a city flag, Belcher said.

   The mayor of a Brussels suburb who
ordered three Roger Somville frescoes to be painted over because she
found them too glaring has asked the Belgian artist to restore them
_ for free.
   The frescoes in the offices and restaurant of the
Watermaal-Bosvoorde City Hall were covered over with paper and
painted over last week when Somville was in Barcelona opening a
retrospective show of his art, to much acclaim.
   Mayor Andree Payfa's view of Somville's work stirred widespread
protests. On Wednesday, she changed her mind and suggested Somville
could return the works to their former glory, free of charge.
   But earlier, Somville called Payfa's decision ``a crime ... pure
lunacy.''
   And even if the covering is removed, Payfa still wants to put the
frescoes behind curtains.
   The harsh greens, yellows and blues made it difficult for her
staff to work normally, she said.

   Eight out of 10 Soviet citizens want their
government to be modeled more on Western lines, according to an
opinion poll conducted for a leftist French magazine.
   Of 1,000 people interviewed by telephone between Feb. 15 and 20
in Moscow, the 82 percent wanting a Western system were just as
strongly represented among Communist Party members as among
non-party members, Le Nouvel Observateur reported in its Wednesday
editions.
   But it said 59 percent of those polled opposed creation of a
political party described as ``democratic and bourgeois,'' standing
for free enterprise and parliamentary democracy.
   Also, 65 percent wanted the ruling Communist Party to play a
bigger role in the nation's future political development, the survey
reported.
   The poll, conducted by Research Center of the Soviet Association
of Sociology, found 74 percent of those interviewed wanted an
ecological party in the Soviet Union, and 20 percent were in favor
of a Christian party.

   On March 26, 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a
historic peace treaty to try to break the cycle of Middle East wars.
For Egypt it has meant better produce in the shops, but also a
feeling of mistrust. Here is the second of two reports.

<TEXT>
   Egypt and Israel have been on speaking terms
for a decade, but it's the relationship of next-door neighbors who
keep a wary eye on each other.
   Egypt is whole again on the maps. Under the peace treaty signed
March 26, 1979, Israel returned most of the Sinai in 1982, 15 years
after capturing in the 1967 war.
   It completed the turnover last week by delivering Taba, a tiny
beach enclave on the Gulf of Aqaba.
   Oil wells in Sinai and the Gulf of Suez, developed under Israeli
occupation, pump money into Egypt. The United States, which under
President Jimmy Carter sponsored the first peace between Arab and
Jew, provides more than $2 billion a year in aid.
   Even the Arab diplomatic boycott caused by the treaty has ended
except for Libya, Syria and Lebanon.
   There will be no celebration of the 10th anniversary, however.
For the average Egyptian there is little to show for the
government's cool friendship with Israel except juicier grapes,
redder strawberries and fatter cucumbers in the market.
   Peace ``is so important to the Israelis and Arabs,'' President
Hosni Mubarak said after the red, black and white Egyptian flag rose
over Taba for the first time in 22 years. ``It is worth whatever
concession.''
   He called for mutual flexibility to solve the remaining problem,
which has led to four Arab-Israeli wars: the future of the
Palestinians.
   Butros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, said Taba
could be the key: ``Solving the Taba problem peacefully ... opens
the door to joint action ... to solve the Palestinian problem.''
   By terms like flexibility and joint action, Egyptian officials
mean Israel should change its policy, negotiate with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and give back Arab territories occupied
since 1967.
   Egyptians tend to mistrust Israel because of the four wars and
many years of regarding it as the eternal enemy. Ghali once
characterized the relationship as Cold Peace.
   Many Israeli tourists visit Egypt but few Egyptians go the other
way. The government discourages trips to Israel and some prosperous
Egyptians say it is too expensive.
   Also, Egyptians generally sympathize with the Palestinians,
especially since the uprising against Israeli occupation began in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip more than 15 months ago.
   Israel often asks Egypt to use friendlier language and fully
implement treaty provisions designed to improve relations through
trade, tourism and cultural exchanges.
   Experts on both sides say agricultural technology is about the
only field in which cooperation flourishes.
   Hany Abdel-Nour, whose company sells irrigation systems that
involve Israeli innovations, said the advantage of working with
Israel is ``that our climatic conditions are similar.''
   Most of his clients are former expatriate workers home from Arab
oil states with money to invest.
   ``They are broad-minded and ready to accept new techniques,''
Abdel-Nour said. ``Some people had reservations at the beginning,
but after a while their misgivings vanished.''
   Another businessman who uses Israeli technology is a former
ranking army officer who fought in the 1967 war, was captured and
spent eight months as an prisoner of war.
   The officer, who requested anonymity, grows grapes with Israeli
know-how and equipment.
   ``This has no relation to war,'' he said. ``My brother was killed
in the war, so my hard feelings should be double, but I still take
technology from them.''
   His family is less pragmatic. The former officer said his wife
refuses to socialize with his Israeli colleagues.
   Four years after President Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem, and two
after he signed the peace treaty, Moslem extremists assassinated him
in 1981.
   Sadat's campaign to win over Egyptians included repeated promises
of prosperity for a people shackled with spending billions on war.
   Early in the peace decade, billboards depicted a long-stemmed red
rose with a slogan assuring citizens of a happy future. Now the
bloom is off the rose.
   ``I was against the whole peace move,'' said Ahmed, a young
agriculture graduate. ``I wasn't fooled that the treaty would bring
prosperity. You can see there is no prosperity; quite the contrary.''
   Rising inflation aggravated by mismanagement, corruption and
lower prices for oil exports has disappointed many Egyptians and
dashed much of Sadat's dream, although none of it can be blamed on
the treaty.
   Taba will be a test for both sides.
   Egyptian and Israeli employees will work together in large
numbers for the first time, at a resort hotel Egypt bought from its
Israeli owner.
   ``I don't know how it'll be, working with Egypt,'' cook Alice
Zerber said on the day the Egyptians took over. ``I don't know
whether I'll accept taking orders from them.''
   Egyptian law requires that 90 percent of a company's employees be
Egyptian, but when and or how that will be implemented at Taba is
unclear.
   About 20 waiters and cooks sent from Cairo arrived minutes after
the 326-room hotel became Egyptian and filed into the poolside
dining room to take instructions from their Israeli counterparts.

   If the Academy Award race for supporting actor
goes according to form, the winner would be Alec Guinness for
``Little Dorrit.'' Or so the experts say.
   After all, the reasoning goes, for the past three years the award
has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work:
Don Ameche, ``Cocoon,'' 1985; Michael Caine, ``Hannah and Her
Sisters,'' 1986; Sean Connery, ``The Untouchables,'' 1987.
   The trouble is that Academy Award voters don't always follow
tradition, and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the
six hours of ``Little Dorrit.''
   The British-made film is based on Charles Dickens' last, often
overlooked novel. Guinness, Oscar winner as best actor for ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, was cast as William Dorrit,
longtime resident of debtors' prison.
   ``The character itself I found fascinating,'' said the
74-year-old actor in a magazine interview, ``because in many ways
it's unsympathetic, feckless and foolish. You know, you'd like to
kick him. ... And yet, at the same time, there is a sympathy for him
because of the social situation at that time, being chucked into
prison for 20-odd years for debt.''
   But Oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote. First, there's
Martin Landau, nominated for ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream.'' For
30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such
as ``North by Northwest, ``Cleopatra'' and ``Nevada Smith,'' though
he is best known as the master of disguises in the original TV
series ``Mission: Impossible.''
   Francis Coppola gave Landau the role of his life as Abe Karatz,
financial adviser to car builder Preston Tucker. Of Coppola, Landau,
54, remarks: ``Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you,
that's a vote of confidence. Francis really creates a background for
you. The more you bring the happier he is.''
   Landau is a director of the Actors Studio in Hollywood, and he
prepared for the role with customary thoroughness. Once an
illustrator for the New York Daily News, he drew portraits of Abe
and analyzed him as ``a lonely New York businessman who really has
no family, no friends and no life outside work.''
   Then there's Dean Stockwell, nominated as the outrageous Mafia
don in ``Married to the Mob.'' He's been in films for 46 of his 52
years. The son of singer Harry Stockwell, Dean was a child actor in
such films as ``Anchors Aweigh,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' and
``The Boy With the Green Hair.''
   His career since then has been a roller coaster: obscurity after
his child-star days; success as a young man in ``Compulsion,''
``Sons and Lovers'' and other films; descent into hippiedom during
the 1960s. He tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act,
but found jobs scarce. Thinking his career over, he and wife, Joy,
moved to Santa Fe, N.M. Suddenly, producers were sending for him.
   Stockwell credits director Jonathan Demme for taking a chance on
him in ``Married to the Mob.'' He remarked: ``No one had ever
thought of me for this type of role. It's a romantic comedy, and I
play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid
of, and it's charming and funny. Prior to that, everyone always
thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and
neurotics and sensitive people.''
   Kevin Kline won his nomination as the madcap but vicious
underworld type in ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' Known for his flamboyant
roles in the theater, Kline, 41, has created a series of indelible
performances on the screen: as Meryl Streep's erratic lover in
``Sophie's Choice''; the college reunion host in ``The Big Chill'';
the swashbuckling buccaneer in ``The Pirates of Penzance.''
   The actor believes that his screen potential hasn't been reached:
``I've done tons of roles on the stage that I haven't even
approached on the screen. I see my film career as wide open. I'd
like to do serious dramas, love stories, action-adventures,
comedies. No one has pigeonholed me yet, and I hope to keep it that
way.''
   The youngest nominee is 18-year-old River Phoenix, named for his
``Running on Empty'' role as the son of political activists on the
run from the FBI. Phoenix has established himself as one of the
screen's best young actors in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Mosquito Coast'' and ``Little Nikita.''
   As part of a free-thinking family that was repeatedly on the
move, Phoenix had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in
``Running on Empty.'' He believes that his peripatetic upbringing
was good training for acting.
   ``I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new
situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go
from film to film,'' he said. ``It also gives you an insight on
different forms of life and different perspectives.''

<TEXT>
   While Solidarity seeks agreement with
authorities at round-table talks, the small but noisy Confederation
for an Independent Poland has stepped up street protests in a drive
for followers to fight communism.
   Shouts of ``KPN,'' the group's initials in Polish, can be heard
at most demonstrations these days. Its banners painted with a black
anchor, the symbol of the Polish resistance during World War II,
often appear in the front ranks of marches, even those called by
other groups.
   ``Strikes and demonstrations awaken people's emotions and they
become enthusiastic,'' said Zygmunt Lenyk, the KPN leader in Krakow.
``It's easier to awaken the enthusiasm of people who strike and
demonstrate than among those who sit.''
   Lenyk's tiny Krakow apartment serves as the headquarters for a
determined core of young activists dedicated to publicizing the name
of the organization, even though it is illegal.
   KPN is the largest and most active of a range of smaller
opposition groups that reject cooperation with the government and
criticize Solidarity on grounds that it is too moderate.
   The groups, which also include Fighting Solidarity and the banned
Polish Socialist Party, have become more active in recent months and
appear to be trying to coordinate activities through joint meetings
of the self-styled ``anti-system opposition.''
   During a recent national KPN congress, a small brigade of young
people covered city walls with black anchors until they ran out of
paint, while more than 200 of their elders debated the
organization's future strategy.
   ``If we want to be a civilized country, we must liquidate
socialism,'' Lenyk said. ``We have to become a parliamentary
country, and we want to liquidate communism.''
   Socialism and communism often are used interchangeably.
   KPN's straightforward strategy has begun to win new sympathizers,
many of whom once belonged to Solidarity.
   But KPN is far from becoming a movement on the scale of
Solidarity, which as a labor union claimed 10 million members in
1981. KPN claims an active membership of 1,600 and 1,000 more in
youth organizations.
   KPN was founded by the historian Leszek Moczulski on Sept. 1,
1979, the 40th anniversary of Hitler's invasion of Poland.
Supporters say they are attracted by the clarity of KPN's call for
Poland's independence from Communist authorities and the Soviet
Union.
   Though the group claims to favor a peaceful path to independence,
young members of KPN often wear military caps and pants and shirts
made of camouflage fabric and have thrown stones at police in
protests. They say such action is taken only in self-defense.
   The organization's militarism and staunch anti-communism has
resulted in a rift between KPN and Solidarity leaders who are now
seeking change by talking with Polish government officials.
   ``KPN, Fighting Solidarity and other independence groups are
treated by us as rival organizations,'' said Zbigniew Bujak, head of
the Warsaw region of Solidarity.
   But KPN appeals to those who favor fighting Communists rather
than supporting a strategy of negotiating changes with authorities.
   ``I was always engaged in the fight for a free Poland. Solidarity
is a trade union, so now I'm going with KPN,'' said Henryk Holfeier,
a retired economist and former Solidarity member who joined KPN a
year ago.
   ``I was attracted to a program with very decisive and clear
goals,'' said Maria Grcor, a psychologist and editor of Opinia
Krakowska, a bimonthly underground publication. ``Solidarity's goals
are clear, but they are too few and too small.''
   Grcor is also a former Solidarity member.
   ``KPN's ultimate goal is full independence for a democratic, free
Poland,'' she said. ``Solidarity is a bridge to this goal and our
interests are linked together.''
   While Solidarity defends the right of independent groups to
exist, the union leadership has kept its distance from KPN,
maintaining it intends only to be a trade union.
   KPN's main activity is street protests.
   ``Street demonstrations break down the barrier of fear and
encourage the belief that people can do something,'' said Grcow.
``Our main goal is for the group to become a mass organization that
will have an influence on society.'' KPN has attracted strong
support among students, especially in Krakow where university
students allied with KPN founded a new group they call the Student
Organization.
   The historic center of this southern city has been the scene
recently of several violent clashes between young people and police,
and KPN has been represented at almost every demonstration.

   Miss America Gretchen Elizabeth
Carlson is midway through her reign, but only one event so far has
been less than enjoyable for the 22-year-old self-described
overachiever from Minnesota.
   She said Miss America pageant officials had set her up as the
victim on a ``bloopers and blunders'' television show, an episode
that forced her to ad-lib a description of a complicated satellite
dish.
   ``It was the perfect joke for me _ an attempt to make me look
stupid,'' she said. ``That's my biggest pet peeve _ making me look
stupid.''
   Her most memorable occasion so far was meeting President Reagan
in the Oval Office.
   ``He reminded me exactly of my grandfather _ I wanted to hug
him,'' she said.
   As she discussed her reign at its halfway point, the Anoka,
Minn., resident shivered and explained she is recovering from a
cold. She was deliberately keeping a quiet schedule Wednesday until
a Salvation Army luncheon, where she had to play the violin.
   Such performances are a part of many functions, giving Miss
Carlson the opportunity to show off the talent that won her the
crown.
   ``I wouldn't mind if the pageant got away from the crown,'' she
said. ``Yes, it makes you immediately recognizable, but that's not
the point. I'd rather have people know me from the inside rather
than the outside.''
   During the past six months, she has visited schools, conventions,
nursing homes, ribbon cuttings, state pageants and endless events on
behalf of the pageant sponsors.
   On a typical evening, she irons her outfit for the next day and
writes back to admiring young girls and women who have asked for her
photograph.
   After her reign, Miss Carlson intends to complete her senior year
at Stanford University. She wants to go to law school, and to become
``a very successful corporate executive.''
   She added, however, that she doesn't consider herself a celebrity.
   ``I like the term `role model,''' she said. ``The more
approachable I am, the better.''

<HEAD>Banned from Easter Dancing, Norwegians Go Skiing Instead</HEAD>

   A 250-year-old ban on dancing during Easter
may finally become a thing of the past. Authorities acknowledge the
law sends few Norwegians to church for solemn prayer _ so many are
on the slopes.
   Every Easter holiday, Norwegians abandon their cities and close
their shops, jamming up mountain roads and ski trails.
   Few actually go to church.
   The dancing ban, made law in 1965, stems from strict 1735 decrees
by the Lutheran Evangelical state church that limit public
entertainment and sports events on religious holidays, said Peter
Selaeg of the Ministry of Church and Education.
   But he added: ``The rules get a little confusing and may be
relaxed when the government finishes reviewing them next spring.''
   Almost everything but church services and skiing is banned on
Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Dancing is allowed Saturday until 9
p.m., though municipalities are empowered to override the rules or
make them stricter.
   Similar blue laws and entertainment bans exist on Good Friday and
Easter in Finland, where the Lutheran church also is an arm of the
state.
   Norway's state-run liquor stores are closed until Tuesday, but
restaurants can still serve alcohol over parts of the long weekend.
At certain times, it's possible to buy a drink at a discotheque,
though customers must keep their feet under the tables and off the
dance floor.
   The Central Bureau of Statistics says 87.8 percent of Norwegians
belong to the state church. In a recent newspaper survey, however,
14.3 percent of those asked said they would consider attending an
Easter church service.
   About 75 percent of the 604 Norwegians surveyed said they no
longer consider Easter a religious holiday, and would rather go
skiing, said the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten.
   Some Norwegians say Easter has become more like a Viking spring
festival than a Christian ritual.
   The Easter holiday has been five days long since the 1700s, but
many Norwegians now begin the traditional exodus to the mountains
the weekend before, drawing on their vacation time.
   The Statistics Bureau says it's a myth that cities are totally
abandoned. ``Only 25 percent of the population is on vacation,''
said a bureau official. However, the figure does not include people
merely gone for the weekend, he added.
   With more than 1 million of their 4.2 million residents skiing in
the mountains, relaxing in cabins by the fjords or flying off to
sunny lands, a strange calm engulfs Norway's largest cities during
the last workdays before the holiday.
   City traffic jams disappear. Chronic parking shortages become
parking space gluts. Skeleton office crews explain that nothing can
be done ``because it's Easter.''
   Among the few people left working by Wednesday afternoon were Red
Cross personnel, foreign businessmen and thieves. Police say Easter
brings a wave of burglaries, as thousands of people leave their
homes vacant.
   The Red Cross' 8,000 volunteers, with blood hounds, helicopters
and other equipment, staff 280 mountain posts to help skiers who get
lost, exhausted or swept up in avalanches.
   For those left in the cities, the Red Cross published a list of
cafes and places of holiday entertainment.
   ``A city emptied by Easter can intensify the loneliness and
isolation felt by those left in the lowlands,'' said a Red Cross
statement.

<HEAD>Gingrich Off the Back Bench and onto the Firing Line</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans gave new status to their most
ardent Democrat-basher by electing Newt Gingrich as their No. 2
leader, but they also put him on the firing line with the Democrats
loaded up.
   ``I think it is manna from heaven,'' said House Majority Whip
Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who said Democrats would remind voters of the
many controversial stands _ such as support for Social Security cuts
_ that the right-wing Georgia lawmaker has taken over the years.
   ``We're no longer talking about someone who is just another
member of the Republican Party,'' Coelho said.
   Gingrich emerged from a closed meeting of House Republicans on
Wednesday with an 87-85 victory over Edward Madigan of Illinois in
the race to become House minority whip, the post made vacant when
Dick Cheney became secretary of defense.
   His was a victory for those Republicans who, after 34 years of
minority status in the House, want more confrontation with the
Democrats. The GOP now holds just 174 of the 435 House seats.
   Gingrich filed the complaint last year that launched an ethics
committee investigation into House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. And
that was only the most notable salvo in a career of using television
and the House rules to agitate against the majority party.
   After the vote, Gingrich insisted he also could work with the
Democrats as one would expect in his new leadership role, if they
give him a chance. He walked across the aisle in the House chamber
that divides the two parties and shook Democratic hands.
   ``I will be fair with anyone who will be fair with me,'' he told
reporters. ``But I'll be ruthless on corruption,'' he said,
insisting that he won't give up his fight against Wright.
   Democrats said they hoped Gingrich was sincere about focusing on
the vote-counting and other legislative tasks of the whip and would
leave behind his longstanding tactics of disruption. But they were
skeptical and wasted no time serving notice that Gingrich will feel
the political heat.
   ``One of the prices on leadership is a certain moderation.
Sometimes learning that is a costly lesson,'' said Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., took to the House floor to confront
Gingrich.
   Gingrich had ``made his name'' with a ``personal attack on the
good name of Jim Wright,'' Alexander said, because of allegations
surrounding the speaker's book publishing royalties.
   Now questions are being raised this week about Gingrich's
financial arrangements surrounding a 1984 publishing deal of his own.
   ``I think he should answer for all of the members of this House
and for all of the American people who have observed this action,''
Alexander said.
   Wright himself made the same point, but with subtly, in the
unusual way in which he congratulated Gingrich.
   The speaker sent Gingrich a copy of his book, ``Reflections of a
Public Man,'' and inscribed it:
   ``For Newt, who likes books too. Congratulations! And if you
think a two-vote victory is thin, try it sometime with one, as I had
to settle for in '76. To be chosen by your peers is a great honor,''
Wright said, referring to his first leadership race.
   Wright signed and dated the inscription, and decorated it with a
sketch of himself, bushy eyebrows and all, wielding a gavel overhead.
   While Gingrich telephoned Coelho and House Majority Leader Thomas
S. Foley in a spirit of conciliation after the vote, he didn't call
Wright and Wright didn't call him.
   Gingrich also made clear that his spirit of conciliation was
limited and not in the mold of Bob Michel, the Republican leader.
   ``All too often in the Republican Party and in the news media,
bipartisanship means ... Republicans have to be passive and
surrender while Democrats and liberals get what they want. That's
nonsense,'' he said.
   With that kind of aggressive stance, Gingrich could well be a
unifying factor for the Democrats.
   Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said if Republicans were looking for
legislative accomplishments, they would have picked Madigan, the
deputy whip and widely respected master of the legislative process.
``They really missed the bet,'' he said.
   Gingrich was ``fully predictable'' in his tactics, he said.
``Maybe he's trying to wear the robe of a statesman, but I don't
think that's going to work,'' he said.
   Many Democrats said they didn't expect Gingrich to be much of a
problem either way.
   ``Is a newt like a chameleon? Can they change and adapt to the
environment?'' asked Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y. Either way, he said,
``We lived with the old Newt. We'll live with the new Newt.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said he hoped for a new Newt, and
in either case the answer would be known quickly.
   ``I think you'll see very clearly which way it's going to go,''
he said. ``I don't think it's going to be a secret.''

<HEAD>Pot Use During Pregnancy Linked With Stunted Babies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pregnant women should be warned that smoking
marijuana may stunt the growth of their unborn babies, and even a
single joint results in prolonged fetal exposure to the drug,
researchers reported today.
   ``This study documents that marijuana during pregnancy is
associated with poor fetal growth,'' said Dr. Barry Zuckerman, who
directed the study.
   The research, based on 1,226 patients at a pregnancy clinic at
Boston City Hospital, found that women who smoked pot produced
babies who averaged three ounces lighter and two-tenths of an inch
shorter than non-users' newborns.
   Zuckerman said the study underscores the belief that the effects
of bad habits during pregnancy add up. While one may have a small
impact on the baby, several together can significantly harm the
child's growth.
   For instance, his study suggests that a woman who gains only 10
pounds during pregnancy, smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and uses
marijuana and cocaine will produce a baby who is 15 ounces smaller
than normal.
   ``It definitely supports the case that marijuana has an effect on
the fetus,'' said Coryl Jones, a research psychologist at the
National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md.
   The study also confirmed earlier reports showing that cocaine
users also produce unusually small babies.
   Zuckerman's study differs from earlier research, which has not
shown a clear association between pot and fetal growth. Those
studies were based solely on mother's admissions of drug use.
   His work, conducted with researchers from Boston University
School of Medicine and published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, used urine tests to document whether pregnant women were
taking drugs.
   The babies of drug-using women ``experience a double jeopardy,''
said Zuckerman. ``They experience biological vulnerability during
pregnancy from these drugs,'' and after birth ``they are more likely
to experience abuse and neglect because of their parents' use of
drugs. They catch it both ways.''
   The researchers speculated that the active chemical in marijuana
may somehow slow fetal growth. Since the drug can remain in the
bloodstream for a month, the study said, ``a single episode of
marijuana use will lead to prolonged exposure of the fetus to the
drug.''
   Marijuana also raises carbon monoxide levels and cuts the amount
of oxygen that reaches the fetus. Although cigarette smoking does
the same thing, the damage from marijuana may be greater because pot
users take bigger puffs and hold in the smoke longer.
   Twenty-seven percent of the women said in interviews or showed on
urine tests that they had used marijuana, while 18 percent had used
cocaine. When only urine test results were considered, 16 percent
showed signs of marijuana and 9 percent of cocaine. The researchers
said those who had drugs in their urine may have been the heaviest
users.
   The researchers compared the babies of mothers with positive
urine tests to those of women who had negative tests and also denied
drug use. Those who used cocaine produced babies who were slightly
smaller than the marijuana mothers', and their babies also had
unusually small heads.
   The women studied were largely poor blacks and Hispanics.
However, Zuckerman said their drug use may not have been much
different from that of young pregnant women elsewhere.
   A nationwide study in 1985 found that 31 percent of women in
their late teens and early 20s said they had used marijuana during
the previous year.

<HEAD>Survey Finds 2.4 Billion Tons of Toxic Air Pollutants a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials and environmental groups are
calling for stronger laws to control toxic air pollutants in light
of a government report showing that at least 2.4 billion pounds of
deadly chemicals are released into the air each year.
   ``The magnitude of this problem far exceeds our worst fears,''
declared Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., after he made a report public
Wednesday that provided the first nationwide glimpse into the volume
of toxic pollutants released by chemical plants and other industrial
sources.
   The report covered 328 chemicals or chemical groups including 60
agents the government has identified as causing cancer. Among the
chemicals are phosgene, used as a nerve gas in World War I, and
methyl isocyanate, which killed more than 2,000 people in Bhopal,
India, in 1984.
   Spokesmen for the chemical industry, which accounted for about a
third of the total volume of toxic pollutants cited in the report,
said it is misleading to link the raw figures to health risk because
they do not take into account actual exposure or concentration.
   They said the emissions are legal and take place within the
restrictions of various state and federal permits.
   ``Anyone who says that there is a national health crisis based on
these numbers is wrong. To use those numbers is misleading,''
insisted Jeffrey Van, chief spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers
Association.
   Waxman, chairman of the House subcommittee on health and
environment, acknowledged that the raw figures do not provide a
clear picture of the health impact because ``we don't really know
how much of which pollutants individuals are actually breathing.''
   Many of the chemicals on the list, however, have been linked to
cancer, birth defects, reproductive dysfunctions, neurological
disorders and genetic mutations, the congressman said.
   The report was compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency
based on information from industry. While the figures, which
reflected emissions from manufacturing facilities in 1987, were
called staggering by some congressmen, environmentalists and
government officials suggested they represent only a fraction _
perhaps no more than one-third _ of the toxic substances that
actually leak into the air.
   The emission totals are based on reports only from large chemical
manufacturers and others with emissions of at least 75,000 pounds a
year. It does not include smaller polluters such as service
stations, dry cleaners and petroleum tank farms.
   But Waxman and other congressmen said they hoped the preliminary
government figures _ even though they may not present the entire
picture _ will provide fuel for enactment of strong air quality
legislation that includes provisions for regulating toxic air
pollutants. How to deal with toxic emissions will be a focus of
debate when Congress rewrites the Clean Air Act later this year.
   Environmentalists also called for stronger legislation to deal
with toxic emissions and Donald Clay, the EPA's top air quality
official, told reporters ``some other approach is needed'' to deal
with toxic air pollution.
   Clay said the EPA has been hamstrung because the law requires the
agency to act on each chemical separately, a time consuming and
expensive process when each action may face legal challenge.
   ``The idea of going down 320 (separate) rules .. is just too
cumbersome,'' he said.
   Clay said the report showed higher emissions than he had expected.
   ``It's a big number. I think it's a health problem that needs to
be addressed,'' he said.
   Only seven of the substances included in the report are now
regulated by the EPA, although a separate agency, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, has set standards within the
workplace for more than 400 toxics including many on the list.
   The National Wildlife Federation called on Congress to enact
legislation that would direct the EPA to establish health-based
standards for all of the listed toxic pollutants, conduct emission
audits and require polluters to put into place the best available
emission control technology within five years.
   Of the 2.4 billion pounds of toxic emissions, the chemical
industry accounted for 886.5 million pounds, followed by the primary
metals, paper, transportation, rubber-plastics and fabricated metals
industries each of which accounted for more than 100,000 pounds.
   Texas led the nation with 229.9 million pounds of toxic
emissions, followed by Louisiana, Tennessee, Virginia, Ohio,
Michigan, Indiana and Illinois all with more than 100 million pounds
during 1987.

   Jeff Healey, the 22-year-old blind
guitarist who has rocked the charts with ``Confidence Man,'' says he
didn't have to cram much for a featured role in the Patrick Swayze
movie, ``Roadhouse.''
   ``The movie's about a bar band playing cover tunes in a cruddy
dive,'' said Healey. ``I've certainly done that enough in my life,
and I'm happy all that practice came in handy.''
   The Canadian-born Healey said he hopes the soon-to-be-released
movie will provide his band with exposure.
   He said his blindness has caused him few problems as a musician.
``I did drop off of a stage once into a bunch of people,'' he
recalled. ``But I was able to get right back up. I joked about it,
and everything was fine.''

   Country singer Roy Clark has become the
first national goodwill ambassador for the U.S. Committee for UNICEF.
   ``As a musician, Roy Clark joins the compassionate tradition
started by Danny Kaye, UNICEF's first international ambassador,''
Lawrence E. Bruce Jr., the U.S. Committee president, said in
announcing the appointment Wednesday.
   Kaye was the first in a line of celebrities to become goodwill
ambassadors for UNICEF. Clark is the first such ambassador for the
U.S. Committee.
   The committee is the oldest and largest of 34 national committees
that promote UNICEF worldwide. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's
Fund, is a semi-autonomous agency within the United Nations with its
own budget and executive board.
   It promotes the welfare of children worldwide through
immunizations, nutrition programs, education and other projects.
   ``You can achieve success and win awards,'' said Clark, in
accepting the appointment, ``but this is a way to share all that
with you people. As young people go, so goes our world.''

   Mayor Sonny Bono's former critics are
speaking well of him after his first year in office.
   ``I give him an `A' for effort,'' said former Mayor Frank Bogert.
``I criticized him to beat the band before he got in because he
didn't have any experience, but he's learned real fast and has a lot
of good ideas.''
   ``My earlier views changed because he is working so hard,'' said
Rose Mihata, businesswoman and founder of a self-appointed watchdog
group that has clashed with Bono.
   The 54-year-old actor and singer conceded: ``The test wasn't
winning the election. The true test was getting the various groups
to trust me ... but there is more confidence now because no one is
questioning my motives anymore.''
   Bono, criticized by those who called his mayoral bid an attempt
to resuscitate a lagging show business career, cashed in on his
celebrity status to promote tourism and secure corporate sponsors
for events in the financially strapped oasis. It was the same kind
of energy he used to help vault the pop duo Sonny &amp; Cher to stardom
in the 1960s.
   Eager to erase a $2.5 million budget deficit and transform Palm
Springs from a golf-happy retirement community into a chic
international travel destination, Bono, who has kept a home in Palm
Springs for 17 years, works at least 60 hours a week at a job that
pays $15,000 a year.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Growing Export Market for US Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're a North Dakota barley farmer, a Texas
sheep producer or a North Carolina tobacco grower, the Agriculture
Department has some reasons for keeping an eye on Saudi Arabia.
   Scores of other agricultural and food processing operations also
are involved in the growing Saudi Arabian market, says John A.
Williams, U.S. agricultural trade officer in Jeddah.
   Over the last five years, Saudi food imports averaged nearly $5
billion annually, up from $1.5 billion in 1977. Williams says the
growth has been fueled by ``the presence of thousands of European
and U.S. expatriates and elaborate consumer food subsidies''
financed by Saudi Arabia's oil wealth.
   ``An influx of immigrant workers in the mid-1970s dramatically
changed Saudi consumer spending patterns,'' Williams writes in the
April issue of AgExporter magazine.
   In 1987, Saudi Arabia, which has a population of about 11
million, imported about 70 percent of its food. Tops in value were:
barley, live sheep, tobacco, milk, poultry, meat, rice, spices,
canned vegetables, fruit juices, fresh vegetables, sugar and corn.
   More than 10 percent of the agricultural imports are from the
United States, making Saudi Arabia the top cash customer in the
Middle East for U.S. farm products.
   Consumer subsidies are used to distribute national income,
derived almost entirely from petroleum, Williams said.
   In 1987, oil accounted for 92 percent of Saudi Arabia's total
exports of $25 billion. Total imports were put at $19 billion,
including $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products. The U.S.
share was about $486 million.
   Williams said the foreign influence has been felt deeply and has
helped change Saudi food-buying customs and diets.
   ``The Saudi population rarely eats out,'' he said. ``The usual
practice is to have parties at home. Even so, with a population of 4
million foreigners, the number and variety of restaurants have
increased over the past few years.''
   Besides many European, Lebanese, Chinese and other ethnic
cuisines, fast-food places serving hamburgers, fruit juice, chicken,
pizza and sandwiches are becoming more widespread.
   Competition for the thriving Saudi food business is also growing,
with U.S. interests vying with European, Asian and South American
suppliers.
   ``The European Economic Community, in particular, places a high
priority on expanding sales of farm products to Saudi Arabia,''
Williams said. ``It has used aggressive market development
activities and a regular flow of trade delegations to widen its lead
over the United States in this market.''
   Saudi Arabia, the world's leading barley importer, has been the
target of fierce competition among the EEC, Australia, Canada and
the United States. In 1987, the United States captured a third of
the Saudi barley market with the help of subsidized sales under the
department's Export Enhancement Program.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold China an additional 400,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday the wheat was part of 2
million tons authorized Feb. 27 for China under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The latest sale boosted the amount of wheat sold to China for
1988-89 delivery under EEP to about 8.2 million tons.
   Sims said the latest sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 195,000
tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 50,000; Bartlett and Co., 30,000;
Ferruzzi USA Inc., 85,000; and Richco Grain Ltd., 40,000.
   The wheat was sold for shipment in May and will carry an average
subsidy rate of $19.94 per ton, or about 54 cents a bushel, he said.
Slightly more than 1.2 million tons are still available under the
current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 400,000 tons would be about 14.7 million bushels and,
at recent prices of about $4.16 per bushel, would have a farm value
of around $61 million.

   Processors of five major vegetables expect to
contract for 1.48 million acres this year, a 10 percent increase
from drought-plagued 1988, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Acreage intentions for all five vegetables are up, led by an 18
percent increase for tomatoes. Green peas should be up 12 percent;
cucumbers for pickles, 11 percent; snap beans, 7 percent; and sweet
corn, 5 percent.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Wednesday
that canning contracts cover 1.06 million acres, up 9 percent from
last year, and freezer contracts about 419,000 acres, up 13 percent.

   A trade association representing banks is
accusing the Bush administration of overkill in proposing civil

   Ed Yingling of the American Bankers Association said the fines

of banks and savings institutions to attract quality managers and
directors.
   ``We must guard against an overreaction that may harm innocent
parties and fundamental rights,'' Yingling said in testimony
prepared for delivery today to the House Judiciary subcommittee on
criminal justice.
   Bush is proposing a top fine of $25,000 a day for most violations
but up to $1 million if the violation was made with reckless
disregard for the safety of the institution. Yingling said the
maximum penalty should be set at $2,500.
   He was appearing before the panel one day after the General
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative agency, told the
subcommittee that it had examined 26 insolvent savings and loans in
eight states and found evidence of fraud or abusive insider dealing
in each.
   Meanwhile, at a hearing Wednesday of a House Banking
subcommittee, Joe D. Whitley, acting associate attorney general,
urged Congress to maintain stiff penalties as a deterrent to
financial fraud.
   ``Because most bankers are honorable people, one might think that
modest sanctions are all that is required to enforce compliance with
our laws: A slap on the wrist is all that a gentleman requires,''
Whitley said. ``The flaw in this rationale is that it is not the
honorable bankers who have caused the massive problems we face
today.''
   GAO officials said the pattern of fraud and abuse among failed
thrifts ``clearly is pervasive.''
   ``The bulk of the losses are directly attributable to the failure
by management of a minority of the industry to follow basic, prudent
business practices,'' Assistant GAO Comptroller General Frederick
Wolf said. He did not name the 26 S&amp;Ls it examined.
   The Justice subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
D-N.Y., complained that of the 11,000 S&amp;L cases the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board has referred to the Justice Department in the last
two years for criminal prosecution, fewer than 200 have resulted in
convictions.
   Whitley told the Banking subcommittee that financial institution
cases have overloaded the criminal justice system. A survey of FBI
field offices showed more than 8,000 pending cases, half of them
involving losses of $100,000 or more.
   Bush is proposing spending $50 million a year on discovering and
prosecuting fraud at banks and S&amp;Ls. The money would pay for 760
investigators, auditors, attorneys and support staff, Whitley said.
   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the examination task force
of the House Banking committee, warned of ``increasing shortages of
experienced examiners.'' He noted that the creation of a
multi-agency S&amp;L task force with more than 1,200 examiners has left
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates commercial
banks, several hundred examiners under strength.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, whose agency
regulates nationally-chartered banks, told Barnard that he is having
trouble hiring and retaining experienced examiners. Nearly 30
percent of the examination force consists of examiners with, on
average, less than 3 years experience, he said, in a plea for
authority to offer higher salaries.
   In another development, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said his agency is working closely with the Treasury
Department to develop a plan to handle the billions of dollars in
real estate the government will inherit from failed S&amp;Ls.
   But Greenspan, who would be a member of the oversight board of
the government entity set up to dispose of the real estate, declined
to provide details of the plan to a House Banking subcommittee.
   Some members of Congress are worried that government ``dumping''
of S&amp;L property at ``fire sale'' prices will ruin regional real
estate markets, particularly in the Southwest.
   Treasury and White House officials are considering a proposal
developed by R.T. McNamar, a California investment banker and a
former deputy Treasury secretary, that would spend state and federal
money to hold onto foreclosed real estate for as long as 10 or 15
years.

<HEAD>Housing Secretary Says Tax Incentives Needed to Make Zones Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Housing secretary Jack Kemp says congressional
inaction to create tax incentives is holding up designation of
federal enterprise zones.
   ``President Bush is in favor of it. It's in the budget. Kemp is
in favor of it. It's now up to Congress to move,'' he said Wednesday
after his appearance before the House Banking, Finance and Urban
Affairs subcommitte on economic stabilization.
   ``In this case we're not looking for an appropriation, we're
looking for a tax change. ... I don't want to make any announcements
of zones ... until there's actually a tax change,'' Kemp said.
``Let's not pass a bill that simply authorizes a zone but doesn't do
anything to put a dramatic change in that entrepreneurial climate.''
   Kemp said reduction or abolishment of capital gains taxes,
same-year tax deduction on up to $100,000 worth of investment and
credits on employee income taxes for individuals and businesses
located in the zones were needed.
   Neither the House nor Senate tax committees has held or scheduled
hearings to consider the proposed changes.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development received 270
applications for the designation before the January 17 deadline.
Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia have enacted local
enterprise zone programs.
   The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, as amended by
the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1988, authorizes the HUD
secretary to designate up to 100 federal enterprise zones, one-third
of which must be located in rural areas.
   The zones are expected to encourage economic development and
employment in previously depressed areas through tax incentives and
reductions, improvements in public services, reductions in
government bureaucracy and involvement of public and private
agencies to provide jobs and job training.
   But a December 1988 study by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, found the program in Maryland ``did
not stimulate local economic growth as measured by employment or
strongly influence most employers' decisions about business
location.''
   GAO said the Maryland program was similar to many of the federal
programs that had been proposed since 1980 when then-Republican
congressman Kemp and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., first initiated
legislation.
   ``I just don't want to go through another eight years of getting
these GAO studies of some zone some place that shows that nobody
started a business because there were no incentives,'' said Kemp.
   Whether successful or not, the program ``won't cost anything,''
Kemp said.
   But GAO estimated more than $1 billion in lost tax revenues
during the first three years of a program that involved 75 zones and
$4.75 billion during the first six years of operation. The Bush 1990
budget estimates $1.05 billion in lost revenues over a four-year
period.

   When a hospital computer catches a virus, the
results can be hazardous to patients' health, a doctor says.
   In a letter in today's New England Journal of Medicine, a
radiologist described what happened when computers used for
analyzing patients' nuclear scans were infected with two computer
viruses.
   Computer viruses are devious pieces of computer code that move
from machine to machine, often reproduce themselves and sometimes
make computers sick.
   Although this time the infection was cured without lasting harm,
Dr. Jack E. Juni said potential damage was serious.
   ``The information on these machines was the actual scans we were
using to make diagnoses,'' he said in an interview. ``If the data
had been lost, it would have affected the diagnoses of patients.''
   One of the viruses was relatively benign, making copies of itself
while leaving other information in the computer alone. However, the
other virus inserted itself into programs and directories of patient
information and made the machines malfunction.
   Juni, of William Beaumont Hospitals in Royal Oak, Mich., said
about three-quarters of the programs stored in two Macintosh II
personal computers were infected.
   He said he did not know the origin of the less harmful virus, but
the more serious one apparently was on the hard disk of one of the
computers when the hospital had bought it. A hard disk is the
internal device used by computers to store programs and data. The
virus spread from one computer to another when a doctor used a word
processing program on both machines while writing a medical paper.
   Juni said the virus caused occasional random malfunctions.
Sometimes the computers would freeze up or garble patients' names.
   The hospital had backup copies of patient records, and eventually
purged the viruses from the computers. It has since instituted
precautions in an effort to keep out viruses.
   Juni said the virus was on a hard disk manufactured by CMS
Enhancements of Tustin, Calif.
   CMS spokesman Ted James said a virus was inadvertently put on 600
hard disks last October. The virus had contaminated a program used
to prepare the hard disks for use. It apparently got into the
company's plant on a hard disk that had been returned for servicing.
   James said that of the 600 virus-tainted disks, 200 were shipped
t dealers, and four were sold to customers.
   However, he said, the virus was ``as harmless as it's possible to
be.'' It inserted a small piece of extra computer code on hard disks
but did not reproduce or tamper with other material on the disk. He
said he did not think Juni's problems were caused by that virus.

   To Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci _ and to
many Christians since then _ Jesus Christ's Last Supper was a
formal, seated gathering at a rectangular table.
   But scholars at a Bible research center say diners in Christ's
era more likely reclined on floor cushions for festive meals, as the
Romans did in that day.
   They also speculate that Judas, contrary to popular belief, may
have had a place of honor at the last gathering of Christ and his
apostles.
   ``Religious art normally pictures the period of the artist, not
the period of the Bible,'' said Jim Fleming of the Biblical
Resources Study Center. ``With apologies to da Vinci, things
probably looked different.''
   During the Last Supper, commemorated Thursday by most of the
world's Christians, Christ broke bread and blessed wine with his
closest disciples hours before he was turned over by Judas to Roman
soldiers and crucified.
   Relying on Bible verses, ancient Jewish writings and Roman
historical works, Fleming and his associates have concluded that the
Last Supper probably was served at a low, U-shaped table that the
Romans called a ``triclinium.''
   ``Straw mattresses generally were placed around the outside, and
guests ate _ and sometimes slept _ at the same place,'' Fleming said.
   The 45-year-old U.S.-educated Bible scholar who has done research
in Israel for 15 years noted the early Greek versions of the New
Testament describe Last Supper participants as reclining.
   He said the Greek words ``anekaito'' and ``anepesen,'' used in
Matthew, Mark and Luke, were often translated as ``sat'' but
actually mean ``reclined.''
   Fleming agrees with other scholars that Christ's Last Supper may
have been a Passover dinner, held by Jews then as now to commemorate
the exodus from Egypt. Rabbis of the day urged followers to recline
at this meal, in the style of the Romans who ruled the Holy Land in
that era, Fleming said.
   Today, Christian pilgrims visit the Cenacle, a building on Mount
Zion in Jerusalem where tradition has it the Last Supper was held.
   Fleming's group has built a Pilgrims' Center on the southern edge
of Jerusalem where visitors can share a Passover feast while
reclining around a stone triclinium.
   The menu, which is as close as the center can get to a Passover
meal in Christ's day, typically includes roast lamb, unleavened
bread, wine, baked eggs, nuts, and fruits such as grapes and figs.
   In artistic renderings of the Last Supper, ``Judas generally is
seated at one end of the dining table, the guy without the halo,''
said Fleming.
   But the Biblical Study Center can cite verses from the gospels of
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John that indicate Judas was very close to
Christ, probably to his immediate left.
   The most convincing is in the gospel of Mark, which alludes to
the practice of sharing food from a common bowl.
   When the apostle John, at Christ's right, asked who would betray
him, Christ answered: ``It is one of the 12, one who is dipping
bread into the dish with me.''
   Christ likely would have shared the bowl with only one or two
people, Fleming said.
   ``In the end, what we're really trying to do is give people a
better understanding of the Bible, of the world of Christ,'' he
said. ``These are just clues that may help.''

   Yves Saint Laurent closed the winter ready-to-wear
collections with a pithy statement of elegance. His show Wednesday
was short and to the point, with beautiful no-nonsense daytime wear
and a burst of colorful folklore for evening.
   This classic couturier no longer has to invent anything, as he
has done it all. But his unmistakably Saint Laurent silhouette and
color palette made good sense for women who want to look chic and
sexy.
   Tailoring was easy, emphasizing softness, though the inimitable
Saint Laurent sleeves under padded shoulders still gave shape to the
outfits.
   At the end of the show Saint Laurent looked pale and
hunched-over, his smile somewhat pained as he walked out and took a
bow, kissing a model who wore a smooth and plain black jersey gown.
Spokesmen for the designer say he is suffering only from fatigue.
   The short, knee-revealing or longer skirts were both split,
modified versions of Saint Laurent's theme last season. He wisely
carries over ideas from his more expensive couture looks,
translating them into clothes many more women can afford in
ready-to-wear.
   The fluid charcoal or oxford gray capes over knickers or wrap
skirts, worn with nailhead-studded belts, kicked off the show and
set the relaxed tone.
   Lots of pants and wrapped skirt suits were in caviar tweeds, gray
or flecked mustard yellow, with short, fitted jackets.
   No matter in what color of tweed, flannel or jersey, Saint
Laurent's pants were invariably fullish with pleats at the hips, and
tailored to ankle length.
   Not all of the wrapped or split skirts looked comfortable, but
they didn't look brazen, either.
   Saint Laurent's ace in the hole was a sleek exercise in false
modesty: a semi-fitted, black, midlength jersey dress piped in
satin, with a line of big buttons marching down the front and up the
sleeves.
   Black, black and more black came out in many tuxedo looks, first
created by Saint Laurent in 1966. The elegant simplicity of all this
was highlighted by an occasional jewel, like a rhinestone star at
hip level where the skirt split.
   But when Saint Laurent got into color he did it in a big way,
using shades of violet, prune and teal in one tuxedo outfit with
soft jersey pants.
   While some fairly loud folklore prints have been seen in Paris
this week, Saint Laurent didn't pull his punches, and offered some
of the most showy models in folklore-knit sweater suits with
dazzling color combinations of yellow, gold and pink or green and
turquoise.
   Although color combinations in cocktail dresses and pajama suits
were shimmering with colors like flame red, shocking pink and
fuchsia, the whole effect was as light as the softest caress.
   The handsome Turkish zouave idea for party time featured short
velvet-calfskin jackets trimmed with arabesques of gold braid with
satin blouses and easy gathered satin pants, sashed with a
nailhead-studded belt _ all topped by a fez-type hat with nailheads.
   The beauty of all this was that any item could be worn separately
with other clothes, especially if they are signed Yves Saint Laurent.

   A policeman and an unidentified gunman who
had taken five persons hostage were killed Wednesday in a gun battle
that reportedly began with the gunman trying to obtain cocaine.
   A second Alexandria policeman was shot and seriously wounded and
was undergoing surgery in nearby Washington, D.C., police said.
   The incident began when the man entered a home in the city's
north end Wednesday afternoon and held five persons hostage,
according to police spokesman Joseph Hilleary.
   Police did not say what prompted the incident, but WUSA-TV
reported the man entered the home, demanded crack cocaine, and
threatened to kill the people there unless they supplied it. One
neighbor, who declined to be identified, said the address was known
in the neighborhood as a crack house.
   Police began negotiating with the gunman and the hostages were
released one at a time, Hilleary said.
   The gunman eventually emerged from the backdoor, holding a
shotgun to the head of a hostage and demanding that police drop
their weapons. One officer fired at the gunman, who fired back,
shooting two policeman.
   In the ensuing fight, the hostage escaped unharmed and the gunman
was killed, Hilleary said.

<HEAD>NBC Promises Improved Program Quality Next Season</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of NBC Entertainment said the
network would boost the quality of its programming next season
because of viewer and advertiser concerns over the content of shows
such as ``Nightingales.''
   ``When we set the fall schedule, we can ... upgrade the quality
of NBC by carefully choosing what shows return and what (prospective
new) shows we select,'' Brandon Tartikoff said Wednesday.
   ``We've beefed up broadcast standards. We are sensitive to
changing audience tastes.''
   The executive spoke at a preview for advertisers and advertising
agencies of 32 prospective new programs for next season. The new
offerings will include the return of ``M-A-S-H'' star Alan Alda in a
one-hour dramatic series, and a comedy created and produced by Mel
Brooks.
   Tartikoff said NBC was concerned about the ``content issue'' of
its shows and the ``restlessness on the part of advertisers,
affiliates and the audience.''
   He did not name any specific program, but ``Nightingales'' has
been criticized by nursing groups that claim it demeans the
profession by showing scantily clad nurses. Chrysler Corp. and
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said they would stop advertising on the show
because of such complaints.
   Tartikoff acknowledged some advertisers had withdrawn from the
show, but he said such pullouts were common and the show was doing
well.
   ``Anytime you push the boundaries of what is acceptable, you're
going to find that you sometimes push too far,'' Tartikoff told
reporters.
   Next season's prospective new offerings were highlighted by the
return after a six-year absence of Alda, who played Hawkeye Pierce
and won five Emmys in 11 years on the smash comedy ``M-A-S-H.''
   ``I haven't been tempted to get back into television until now,''
said Alda. The actor will be involved in the creation and writing of
the show, but he declined to say what it would be about except to
say: ``We'll be very proud of it. We're very up about it.''
   Tartikoff said the show probably would not debut until the middle
of the 1989-90 season.
   The prospective programming continues to place a heavy emphasis
on comedy, which has been largely responsible for making NBC No. 1
in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   Brooks will create and produce a series called ``The Nuthouse''
about a New York hotel, starring Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman.
   Rodney Dangerfield will have cameo roles in ``Young Rodney,''
about a boy whose idol is the comic.
   Also among the shows previewed:
   _ Jack Warden, Mason Adams and Hope Lange will star in ``Knight
and Daye,'' a comedy about two feuding former radio partners forced
to reunite after a long separation.
   _ Ann Jillian will star as a widow and mother of a teen-age girl
who moves from New York to California to start a new life.
   _ Robert Mitchum will play a homeless former merchant seaman who
becomes a surrogate grandfather for four newly orphaned children in
``One Man's Family.''

   President Bush says religious faith and family
togetherness are the best antidotes to the drug threat in America.
   During visits in Pennsylvania with Amish and Mennonite leaders
and young people, Bush wove much of his philosophy about proper
lifestyles into discussions surrounding drug abuse.
   The president listened sympathetically Wednesday as Mennonite
leader Elmer Burkholder wondered aloud whether his 4-year-old son
would ``be able to say no, to maintain his values.''
   Bush, who traveled to southeastern Pennsylvania as part of his
anti-drug campaign, called the religious and tradition-minded Amish
and Mennonites of the area ``a shining example of what family and
faith can do.''
   Bush reiterated his contention that prayer should be restored in
public schools. He also said that while ``we want to preserve
freedom of expression,'' he believes much of today's popular music
has ``really bad lyrics.''
   Sitting around a table in a classroom of an old, simple one-story
Amish school, the president listened as his hosts talked of the
increasing pressures brought to bear on young people.
   The Amish and Mennonite leaders told Bush that their relative
success in child-rearing came from their deep-rooted family and
religious values.
   Bush marveled at how they had kept drugs away from their
doorsteps. He told the Amish and Mennonite leaders to keep ``the
moral underpinnings of your community, and hopefully others will see
your example.''
   After watching a karate demonstration by young boys and girls
enrolled in a program in Wilmington, Del., aimed at keeping kids off
drugs, Bush chatted informally at length about the pressures on
today's youth.
   ``They had drugs around when I was a little guy, but I hate to
tell you how old I am,'' said the 64-year-old president. ``It wasn't
as much. There wasn't the pressure on kids in schools. It's just
kind of come in more lately, you know.''
   A few moments later he was asked: ``What do you do to keep drugs
out of your life?''
   ``Well, kind of getting along in my level of life here, the
pressures aren't quite that big,'' Bush replied. ``You don't have a
lot of guys coming up to you in daily life saying, `Hey.'
   ``So I don't have the temptations and the pressures that you've
got, like young guys in school and all of that,'' he added. ``But I
think if I did, I'd try to do what you're doing _ I'd try to have
that lifestyle going in such a way and helping the law enforcement
so people wouldn't be tempted to offer up those narcotics.''
   Bush acknowledged to his young audience that, as president, he
probably won't have an opportunity to test that approach personally.
   ``It would be pretty hard for some drug guy to come into the
White House and start offering it up, you know,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shortchanged Taxpayers May Apply for Refund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxpayers whose 1985 federal refunds were
shortchanged or lost because they forget to subtract taxes already
withheld have only 25 days to file a claim with the IRS.
   After April 15, the refunds will be lost forever.
   The Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday outlined a procedure
for filing such refund claims, one day after acknowledging that an
old policy had prohibited IRS employees from notifying taxpayers who
neglected to take a credit for withheld taxes.
   The agency indicated that most people who got squeezed by the old
policy probably were taxpayers who in 1985 received lump-sum pension
payments from which some taxes were withheld. Most such payments
were reported to the taxpayer and the IRS on Form 1099R.
   ``Taxpayers should review their 1985 returns, especially if tax
withholding was reported on a Form 1099,'' the IRS said Wednesday.
``If taxpayers find that they have not claimed all their withholding
for 1985 they should file a special claim.''
   The IRS also announced that after additional review, it will
issue instructions on how to apply for refunds that were not made
for the same reason on returns filed in 1987.
   The new policy _ which Acting Commissioner Michael J. Murphy says
simply restates the basic IRS position that ``taxpayers pay only the
tax due _ no more, no less'' _ affects returns filed in 1988 and
later years.
   Murphy announced Tuesday night that IRS employees were no longer
barred from informing taxpayers who forgot to consider withheld
taxes when they calculated what they owed.
   The agency's hand was forced by several employees in the IRS
Memphis regional service center, who complained privately to Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., that the old policy amounted to stealing
from taxpayers. One of those employees, Linda Johnson, a returns
examiner, went public with her complaints after talking to Gore.
   ``On a lot of returns, the taxpayer often failed to notice ...
that money was withheld, especially from pensions,'' Ms. Johnson
explained. ``A lot of times these taxpayers had paid someone else to
do their returns. But when we questioned it, we were told that
taxpayers would have to find their own mistakes.''
   Ms. Johnson said she personally handled dozens of such returns,
on which taxpayers overpaid their taxes. In most cases, she said,
the taxpayers were pensioners and the overpayment was between $100
and $1,000.
   A taxpayer's failure to subtract withheld taxes would likely be
detected as part of the operation in which W-2 and 1099 forms from
employers, banks and other payers are matched against income
reported on a tax return. A computer will find, for example, that
interest income was not reported where it should be on a return.
   Ms. Johnson or some other examiner would then try to determine
whether the taxpayer reported it on the wrong line or the wrong
form. If the examiner could not resolve the discrepancy, the
taxpayer would be sent a letter demanding an explanation.
   To claim a refund of 1985 taxes because of the withholding
problem, a taxpayer may file Form 1040X, Form 843, or a simple
statement explaining the circumstances. In any case, the notation
``1985 income tax withholding claim'' should be entered at the top
of the page.
   If the taxpayer opts to file a statement explaining the claim, it
must include the taxpayer's name, address and Social Security
number; the withholding figure that was entered on the original
return, the correct withholding and the refund due. The statement
must be signed, dated and postmarked by April 15.
   Claims should be sent to the Problem Resolution Officer at the
IRS service center to which the 1988 tax return is being mailed.

<HEAD>Chrysler Chairman Says Business Should Invest in Schools</HEAD>

   Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee Iacocca is telling
business it must help schools teach youth or end up paying the cost
of remedial education for workers.
   ``You and I are spending more money teaching remedial mathematics
to our employees than all the grade schools, high schools and
colleges in the country are spending on mathematics instruction,''
Iacocca said in a speech Wednesday to the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``I am getting more scared every day.''
   Shirley Frye, president of the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics and director of curriculum development for the
Scottsdale, Ariz., public schools, said she did not know how much
was spent on teaching mathematics or where Iacocca got his estimate,
but she had no reason to doubt it.
   ``That is an alarming statistic,'' she said.
   The council earlier this week released recommended standards to
make sure students learn how to reason mathematically, knowing when
to perform various mathematical operations, as well as just how to
add, subtract, multiply, divide and do other calculations.
   Iacocca gave no source for his mathematics estimate, but said
Chrysler spends $117 million a year on training, ``10 percent of it
on the three R's,'' elementary reading, writing and arithmetic.
   Business executives and parents must demand tougher educational
standards, more effective expenditure of the $328 billion annually
that the nation devotes to education and measures to strengthen the
professionalism and status of teachers, Iacocca told his luncheon
audience.
   ``In Japan, teachers are on a pedestal, like they were when I was
a kid growing up in Allentown, Pa., years ago,'' and Japanese
teachers are among the highest-paid professionals in the country,
Iacocca said.
   Chrysler has had to reduce the difficulty of its training
materials from ninth and 12th grade levels to sixth grade or below
because a ``frightening'' number of workers could not read it, ``And
sometimes even sixth grade isn't enough.''
   One assembly line had a button reading ``bad hood fit,'' but ``We
had to replace that with graphics because the guys just couldn't
handle those three monosyllables.''

<HEAD>Bevill: Foreign Countries Must Agree To Contribute Before Congress

   Congress wants a solid financial commitment
from foreign countries before moving ahead with the $4.6 billion
superconducting super collider, but the foreign countries want
Congress to take the first step.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on energy and water development, said Wednesday: ``They
are going to have to put their name on the line. We like to talk in
specific terms and Congress likes to hear specific figures. I don't
like to be vague about it.''
   But Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said foreign countries are
waiting for Congress show its commitment to building the high-energy
physics project in Texas before they chip in.
   Watkins complained it's a ``chicken and egg situation this year''
and testified Wednesday that everyone ``is looking for the next
person to make the next commitment.''
   India is the only country that has signed a cost-sharing
agreement and will provide $50 million.
   Bevill, D-Ala., countered there won't be much incentive for other
countries to participate once the United States takes on the funding.
   When Congress agreed to spend $100 million on the super collider
last year, ``that's getting pretty serious, that's pretty
committed,'' Bevill told Watkins.
   Asking Congress to approve the project without knowing exactly
how much is coming from non-federal sources is ``asking for
trouble,'' Bevill said.
   The Energy Department is proposing $1.8 billion toward the cost
come from non-federal sources, including $1 billion from the state
of Texas.
   But even Texas is not willing to begin spending its share if
Congress is not committed to construction, and wants a refund clause
in case the federal government backs out.
   President Bush has proposed a $250 million appropriation for next
fiscal year, including $160 million for construction. Congress
restricted last year's appropriation to research and development.
   The DOE has chosen a site around Waxahachie for the super
collider, a 53-mile underground tunnel in which beams of protons
would smash into each other with 20 times the energy of today's most
powerful accelerators.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are sorting through the views
expressed in four hours of discussion with the Palestine Liberation
Organization in which the PLO was urged to ease tensions in
Israeli-held territory.
   Assessing Wednesday's meeting in Tunisia between U.S. Ambassador
Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. and Yasser Abed-Rabbo of the PLO, State
Department officials were unable to draw any immediate conclusions.
   ``There was no definitive answer,'' said one official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. He said the two sides would have to
analyze the four-hour discussion and meet again at a date to be
determined.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III hopes the meeting will be a
springboard to eventual peace talks and immediate
``confidence-building'' measures on the West Bank and in Gaza where
a Palestinian uprising helped propel the United States into dealing
with the PLO.
   ``The idea is to try to move toward dialogue and away from
fighting with some practical steps,'' the official said. But, beyond
that, ``the idea is to keep in mind there are ultimate goals.''
   ``Basically, now is the time for considering each other's views
for future discussion,'' the official added.
   In the meeting, Pelletreau, under instruction from Baker, asked
the PLO not to stand in the way of Palestinians on the West Bank and
in Gaza who might be willing to talk to Israel.
   The U.S. side stressed ``the need to get inhabitants on the
ground involved'' in steps toward peace, the official said.
   Pelletreau made those points without going into much detail on
the measures. But Baker's aim is known to include an easing of the
15-month Palestinian rebellion in exchange for Israel's release of
Arabs detained in the violence that has taken a death toll of more
than 400 civilians.
   ``It's a two-way street in this respect,'' the official said.
   While Baker wants to begin the peace process in small steps, he
has told Congress his goal is a dialogue between Israel and
Palestinians _ or the PLO, if that is the only ``meaningful'' form
of negotiations.
   He also told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday that
Israel should trade land for peace ``as a solution to the problems
in the Middle East.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir declines to negotiate with
the PLO and holds it responsible for continuing terrorist attacks
against his country. Shamir will be here early next month for talks
with Baker and President Bush.
   Abed-Rabbo, the head of the PLO delegation, is second-in-command
of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   The faction was accused by Israel last month of sending
guerrillas on an infiltration mission despite Chairman Yasser
Arafat's renunciation of terrorism last December. The guerrillas
were intercepted in southern Lebanon, across Israel's border.
   The U.S. government, in its ``Terrorist Group Profiles,''
described the Democratic Front, which is headed by Naif Hawatmeh, as
Marxist-Leninist and pro-Soviet in policy. It has ``repeatedly
affirmed its hostility and resistance to U.S. policy in the region''
and carried out bombings and grenade attacks against Israel, the
document said.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said ``it troubles me that the
person meeting with the American ambassador is a leader of an
organization that continues to participate in terrorism even after
Arafat's promises.''
   In December, Hawatmeh called for an escalation of the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli control. From its headquarters in Syria, he
said ``maneuvers to stop the uprising under slogans of a partial
truce or deals with occupation forces will never succeed.''
   Hawatmeh added: ``We warn the PLO to beware of becoming a victim
of this trap.''

<HEAD>Antitrust Investigators Eyeing Delta-American Reservations Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Antitrust investigators are looking into a
planned merger of two airline-operated computer reservations systems
that critics say will further decrease competition in commercial
aviation.
   Officials of American and Delta airlines said Wednesday they
still hope to start the new system May 1, capturing a 44 percent
share of the airline reservations market and reducing the number of
companies in the field from five to four.
   The systems accept reservations for any airline, but critics say
they tend to favor the airlines that own them. All existing systems
are owned by major airlines.
   The Justice Department, which on Jan. 1 took over jurisdiction of
airline industry mergers from the Transportation Department, has
sent out requests for information from both airlines and has issued
several ``civil investigative demands'' to other companies that
might be affected, according to Delta and American officials.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown confirmed that a civil
investigation of the merger is under way, but said department rules
prohibit disclosure of actions taken during the inquiry.
   Such investigations would ordinarily seek information from
competitors and others that might have an interest in a merger, as
well as the companies directly involved, she said.
   The combined American-Delta system would control 44 percent of
the nation's airline reservations. America's Sabre system is already
the largest in the industry, handling about 35 percent of
reservation business. Delta's Datas II has about a 9 percent market
share.
   The systems are leased by travel agents.
   The merger does not need federal approval, but the department has
30 days from the filing of an announcement to bring an antitrust
case if it wants to stop the deal. Requests for additional
information extend the deadline to 20 days after company response to
the requests.
   Both American and Delta officials said they were putting together
responses to several broad questions the department is asking.
   James Lundy, Delta spokesman, said the companies still hope to
meet the May 1 date for setting up the new reservations company. No
name has yet been selected for the partnership, he said.
   Among those critical of the merger are some other airlines, state
attorneys general and consumer advocates. Some say it threatens to
reduce competition further among the dwindling number of major
carriers.
   Several groups had written the Justice Department urging an
antitrust inquiry.
   Christopher Witkowski of the Aviation Consumer Action Project,
said in a letter that the industry is dominated by airlines that own
interests in reservations systems.
   Karen Cook, American spokesman, said, ``We are still very
optimistic'' that the merger can take place on May 1.
   Under the proposed merger, Delta is to pay American $650 million
for a 50 percent share in the new company. U.S. airlines without
ownership in another U.S. reservations system will be allowed to buy
shares at $20 million for a 1 percent interest.
   Other domestic and foreign carriers, as well as other
travel-related companies, may buy in with approval of existing
owners, but Delta and American will each retain at least a 25
percent share.

<HEAD>Repair Kits for Cargo Planes Are Defended Despite High Price</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is defending its deal with a
major defense contractor for $68 million in kits to repair crash
damage to C-5 cargo aircraft despite overpriced parts and the
ineffectiveness of the kit on a damaged plane.
   ``We in the Air Force Logistics Command remain firmly convinced
that the decision to buy C-5 crash damage repair kits and the
methodology of the acquisition for these kits is correct and
appropriate,'' Major Gen. Richard D. Smith told the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations Wednesday.
   Testimony by Air Force officials and members of the General
Accounting Office revealed that Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.
proposed prices of $229.94 for a nickel-size washer and $211.13 for
an inch-long aluminum shim that was an excess part from production
of the C-5B. The part originally was valued at $22.09.
   ``It looks to me that no matter how we look at the matter, we're
being taken and the taxpayers are being skinned here,'' said Rep.
John Dingell, chairman of the subcommittee.
   Smith defended the price of the washer, saying: ``It's not a
common washer. It's critical for the structure of the aircraft.''
   The Air Force based its need for the kits on two crashes and a
lightning strike, according to the GAO. But a C-5A that was damaged
in a fire at Travis Air Force Base in California on Dec. 30, 1988,
cannot be repaired with the kit, which is for repair to the
underbelly of the aircraft.
   The damaged C-5A has a hole about 13 feet by 33 feet in the upper
fuselage.
   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, also found that retired Air
Force Col. Anthony Diferdinando negotiated the Pentagon contract
with Lockheed and later went to work for the company.
   Diferdinando ``did not comply with provisions in a conflict of
interest law requiring that he report his employment contracts and
disqualify himself from procurement functions involving Lockheed,''
the GAO said.
   ``However, we did not find any evidence to indicate that his
actions regarding the purchase of the kits were influenced by
employment.''
   Dingell said the Air Force Office of Special Investigations began
a criminal investigation of the colonel for conflict of interest
last Thursday.
   A spokesman for Lockheed, Hugh Burns, said the company ``has
complied with all conflict of interest laws and to the best of our
knowledge so did Mr. Diferdinando.'' Diferdinando remains an
employee at Lockheed.

   There's nothing funny about a 5 percent
jump in the cost of a good yuk, according to the man who compiles
the annual Cost of Laughing Index.
   The tab for rubber chickens, Groucho Marx glasses,
arrow-through-the-head novelties and copies of Mad magazine remained
stable during the past year, but prices of some humorous singing
telegrams have gone up 18 percent and admission to some comedy clubs
has climbed, Malcolm Kushner said Wednesday.
   ``This year's index has some good news and some bad news,'' said
the attorney-turned-humor-consultant.
   ``The good news is rubber chicken prices have stabilized after
jumping 23 percent between 1986 and 1988. The bad news is they're
still too expensive to come home to roost.''
   Rubber chickens cost $48 a dozen wholesale from a supplier in New
York state, and Groucho glasses run $12 a dozen, he said.
   Kushner said he's found an average 6.9 percent jump in comedy
club admissions. While the Comic Strip in New York is holding the
line at $12, The Punch Line in Atlanta went up $2 to $10, the Laugh
Factory in Los Angeles added $2 to its $6 charge and the Holy City
Zoo in San Francisco went up $1 to $8, he said.
   Among other increases, the minimum fee for writing a television
situation comedy went up 5 percent to $8,733 under the Writers Guild
of America contract, Kushner said.
   The consultant gives speeches and seminars on how to use humor in
business to clients ranging from International Business Machines
Corp., General Electric Co. and the Internal Revenue Service. He
says he thinks he made the right move leaving the law for laughs.
   ``Whether or not you think the world needs a humor consultant,''
he said, ``it can definitely use one less attorney.''

   An elementary school principal who
pledged to go to great heights to spur his pupils to read did just
that _ he spent the day on the school's roof.
   Whitehall Elementary School Principal John R. Muller told pupils
at the start of the school year he would spend a day on the roof _
despite his fear of heights _ if they would read 1 million pages.
   The 650 pupils reached their goal this month, helped by guest
speakers and parents whose reading to the children was counted in
the total.
   So on Tuesday, Muller relinquished his duties to a fifth-grader,
put on a heavy winter coat, gloves and hat and was hoisted onto the
roof by the Cecil Fire Co.
   ``Someone suggested that I sleep overnight,'' Muller said. ``If
it would get them to read another million pages, I'd probably do
it.''
   Pupils now are working on another million-page goal with a prize
of a field day in June complete with a picnic lunch and rock band.
In three weeks, they have turned over about 30,000 pages, according
to Marcia Peitrowski, a reading specialist at the school.

   The town of Prompton supposedly earned its
name because its inhabitants always paid their bills on time.
   The tradition certainly continues.
   Judith Knash, director of the Wayne County Tax Claim Bureau, said
Tuesday that there weren't any Prompton residents on the bureau's
list of property owners who hadn't paid their 1988 taxes by the Feb.
28 deadline.
   Prompton, which has 142 taxable parcels this year, last had no
delinquent taxes in 1981, Ms. Knash said.
   None of the 27 other tax districts in the northeastern
Pennsylvania county could claim a similar record since the tax
bureau was created in 1976, she said.
   ``The trend here has been increasing numbers,'' she said.
Delinquencies countywide have risen from 6,124 in 1983 to 6,608 in
1987, she said.

<HEAD>More Than 100 Nations Adopt Waste Shipment Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 countries have endorsed a
proposed U.N. treaty that supporters say will slow the alarming and
unregulated rise in toxic waste shipments across international
borders.
   The treaty, immediately signed by 34 countries after its approval
Wednesday, requires signatories to provide detailed information on
intended toxic shipments and to ensure that importing nations can
handle them in an ``environmentally sound'' way.
   Signers of the convention also pledge to forbid the shipment of
hazardous wastes to countries that have banned their import.
   Waste generation and dumping in foreign countries are to be kept
to a minimum, and developing countries are promised technical aid.
   Backers say the treaty is the first step toward restricting
shipments of dangerous waste to nations unequipped to deal with it.
But environmentalists contend it would merely legalize the transport
of such materials.
   The treaty was adopted by delegates of 105 countries after a
three-day U.N.-sponsored conference and 18 months of hard
bargaining. It intends to confront growing international waste
traffic and fears about poor countries accepting shipments in
exchange for lucrative payments.
   Twenty countries must formally ratify it before it can go into
force. U.N. officials have said this could take up to two years.
   The United States, Britain and West Germany were among major
industrialized countries not signing immediately. Delegates were
taking the text back for consideration by their governments.
   Among the countries that signed on Wednesday were Canada, France,
Italy and host Switzerland. Hungary was the only Soviet bloc country
to sign.
   None of the 40 African delegations signed the convention.
   Mostafa Tolba, chief of the sponsoring U.N. Environment Program,
said African lands are committed to the treaty and he expects their
signatures after a policy-setting summit meeting in June of the
Organization of African Unity.
   Most waste traffic is between industrialized countries. But Tolba
warned that movements between developing countries were on the verge
of becoming a problem which ``God knows how we are going to control.
   ``Our agreement has not halted commerce in poison,'' Tolba said
in prepared remarks. ``But it has signaled the international resolve
to eliminate the menace hazardous wastes pose to the welfare of our
shared environment and to the health of all the world's peoples.''
   He urged all countries to ratify the convention quickly.
   The Greenpeace environmental group said the text merely legalizes
the international waste trade and was weakened to please
industrialized countries. It again called for a complete ban on
cross-border dangerous shipments.
   A total of 42 countries, more than half of them in Africa, have
banned waste imports, Greenpeace said.
   The convention does not explicitly cover shipments through a
member's territorial waters, a point demanded earlier by many
coastal states.
   Another contentious issue, liability for damage from wastes, was
put off for further talks.U.S. delegate Philip Winn said Washington
would oppose such talks.
   Under the treaty, individual nations can sign separate waste
trade treaties with non-signers but they must offer at least as much
environmental protection as the U.N. provisions.
   Final approval became possible after negotiators compromised
Tuesday over Third World demands for tougher language, including
greater responsibilities for waste-exporting countries and tighter
compliance provisions.
   Among 16 Third World countries signing immediately were
Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Haiti, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico,
Panama, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.
   The problem was highlighted last year when tons of toxic waste
shipments from industrialized countries were found dumped in African
nations and when waste-laden ships traveled from port to port
seeking permission to unload.

   A congressman added to the widespread pressure
to end a wave of drug trafficking and violence in the nation's
capital by calling for the federal government to take over public
safety in the District of Columbia.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., says he will introduce legislation that
would authorize President Bush to appoint a National Capital Public
Safety Director responsible for managing the district's police and
fire departments, emergency ambulance service, and corrections
system for a five-year period.
   ``The situation in our nation's capital is clearly out of
control,'' Parris said Wednesday in a statement. ``The drug dealers
are perpetuating their bloody carnage with impunity, since they know
there is little that will done to them.''
   Parris' proposal was the second from Congress in less than a
week, and it came as the drug-related crime spree in the nation's
capital has gained new attention.
   Last Thursday, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., touched off a furor by
suggesting a ``federal constabulary'' might need to be created to
help slow the city's record murder rate. Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C., said he would endorse such legislation.
   Last year, a record 372 people were killed in the district, and
police blame 60 percent of those killings on drugs. That total, and
the highest per-capital murder rate of any city in the country, gave
Washington the distinction of ``Murder Capital of America.'' Through
Wednesday, 119 murders had occurred in the district during 1989,
roughly twice as many as in the comparable period in 1988.
   Parris' Northern Virginia district includes the city-run Lorton
Corrections Facility. Despite his plans for stepped-up law
enforcement, Parris says he is opposed to any expansion at that
3,800-acre jail facility.
   John C. White, Mayor Marion Barry's spokesman, said Barry has not
seen Parris' bill and will not comment until he reads it.

<HEAD>Former Technician Says NRC Paid Him to Prevent Publication of Evidence</HEAD>

   A former nuclear plant technician says he
believes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission paid him $4,000 to
testify against the agency's No. 2 investigator only so it could
quash evidence against other high-ranking officials.
   Douglas S. Ellison said Wednesday that he was giving the NRC
information about Roger A. Fortuna, the deputy director of the
agency's Office of Investigations, late last summer when NRC
officials offered to pay him.
   He said the unsolicited and highly unusual offer came after he
warned NRC officials that he would ``scream fire and foul play'' if
the commission did not follow up on his alleged evidence of
wrongdoing against Fortuna and other NRC officials.
   The NRC's contract with Ellison, under a section titled ``special
terms and conditions,'' specifies that Ellison ``may not discuss
this contract or the information to be furnished the NRC hereunder
with any person.''
   ``The effect of it was to gag me, to prevent me from going in
front of the media,'' Ellison said in a telephone interview from New
Smyrna Beach, Fla.
   Ellison claims the NRC has done nothing with his information and
only moved recently to fire Fortuna after Ellison took his
information to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. He said the NRC is
ignoring evidence he provided against other high-ranking commission
officials, singling out Fortuna as a scapegoat.
   NRC spokesman Frank Ingram declined comment on Ellison's
accusations and other aspects of the Fortuna investigation, saying
the case was ongoing. The NRC wants to fire Fortuna, citing his
refusal to testify before a court reporter on allegations of
misconduct originally leveled by Ellison.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., had provided The Associated Press a
copy of an NRC purchase order that authorized Ellison to be paid $40
per hour for ``the 100 hours of effort estimated under this
contract,'' plus $117 a day in expenses.
   In a letter Wednesday to NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr.,
Gejdenson and Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., charged that the payment
``appears to be part of an ongoing effort by the NRC to undermine
the effectiveness and independence'' of the agency's Office of
Investigations.
   The Office of Investigations probes wrongdoing by plant
operators. The NRC is often accused by lawmakers and other critics
of being too soft on the industry it is assigned to regulate.
   Ellison, 40, worked at the Nine Mile Point Unit I plant in
Scriba, N.Y., when he told NRC investigators in 1986 about alleged
safety problems at the plant. Fortuna decided against pursuing the
allegations, and federal prosecutors in Syracuse, N.Y., declined
prosecution, according to Gejdenson.
   In August, Ellison charged that Fortuna discussed ``sensitive and
confidential NRC information and strategies concerning several OI
investigations with unauthorized third parties'' and ``matters
involving (Ellison) with third parties,'' according to a partial
transcript of his testimony from Sept. 12, 1988.
   One of the third parties was Stephen B. Comley, a Massachusetts
anti-nuclear activist. In the interview Wednesday, Ellison charged
that Comley urged Fortuna not to take action on the evidence Ellison
provided because it would interfere with Comley's personal

<HEAD>Yeltsin Rally Draws Thousands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people demonstrated on behalf of
popular reformer Boris N. Yeltsin and condemned what they call the
perks and privileges of a corrupt Communist Party bureaucracy.
   Yeltsin, who was ousted as Moscow party boss last year because of
his outspoken views, is running for a seat representing Moscow in
the newly created Soviet legislature, the 2,250-seat Congress of
People's Deputies.
   A rally Wednesday on his behalf, the second in less than a week,
was also a protest against the party elite.
   ``Yeltsin is strongest in the struggle with bureaucracy and
dishonesty in society,'' said Olga Ulitova, a Communist Party member
for 27 years. ``He is the only one in 70 years of Soviet power who
did not take the privileges offered by his high position.''
   ``He struggles for the party, for a clean party!'' Moscow worker
Valery Reptov shouted to the crowd.
   Several hundred Yeltsin supporters gathered near a statue to
Moscow's medieval founder, Yuri Dolgoruky, across from city council
headquarters. The crowd soon grew to about 5,000, many of them
onlookers.
   Authorities did not grant permission for the demonstration, which
came in the final days of campaigning before Sunday's elections.
Busloads of police were present but did not try to stop it.
   Also Wednesday, members of the Academy of Sciences considered a
new election for its delegates to the new legislature after a
rebellion against old guard candidates gave new life to the
candidacy of human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov.
   The day before, more than 1,200 academy members approved just
eight of a list of 23 candidates presented by its leadership. The
academy has been alloted 20 seats and a new election must now be
held to fill the 12 vacancies.
   A new slate of nominees is to be presented in two weeks, but it
is not yet clear how they will be chosen. The previous selection
process was widely criticized as undemocratic.
   ``This was a result of a great grassroots movement of the
scientific intelligentsia. If they choose me to be a candidate and a
deputy, I will not refuse,'' said Sakharov, a physicist who won the
1975 Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Soviet Union's first experiment with contested elections has
spurred rare open debate and criticism of the government.
   Even Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the
Soviets were feeling their way toward democracy, and he said the
present election law likely will be changed after the new
legislature is seated.
   Gerasimov said the new Soviet electoral law ``was passed a little
too quickly without sufficient study of foreign legislatures.''
   He made his comments to the French Diplomatic Press Association
in Paris, which he is visiting in part to make arrangements for a
July trip by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gerasimov also acknowledged that Yeltsin has become an opposition
symbol.
   He said that ``on listening to Yeltsin you get the impression
that his platform is not different from the party's. At the same
time some of his ideas make you think he is deviating from the party
line.
   ``Moreoever, those who want such a divorce (from the party) have
rallied around him. He is on the way to becoming the symbol of the
opposition. If it is not already the case, it's starting to happen.''
   Gerasimov said he did not find a Sunday demonstration by several
thousand Yeltsin supporters in Moscow unusual in the context of a
political campaign.
   ``The best means for public opinion or at least a part of it to
express itself is to peacefully demonstrate,'' he said.
   Yeltsin, who did not appear at Wednesday's rally, was Moscow
party chief until his ouster in November 1987 for criticizing the
slow pace of reforms and warning that a cult of personality could
develop around Gorbachev.
   He has remained popular among Muscovites as he runs for the
legislature against Yevgeny Brakov, director of the giant ZIL
factory that produces limousines and household appliances.
   Both as Moscow party leader and in his campaign, Yeltsin has
lashed out at the privileges party and government officials receive.
They include chauffeurs and access to special stores stocked with
scare goods.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, which will meet only one day a
year, is to elect the country's acting full-time legislature from
among its membership and choose the Soviet president.
   A total of 750 seats in the congress are alloted to organizations
like the Academy of Sciences and the Communist Party. The rest are
to be filled in Sunday's nationwide elections.

   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while share prices were firmer on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
after falling for four consecutive trading days.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, which shed 211.56 points
Wednesday, gained 145.42 points or 0.46 percent to finish at
31,588.66.
   The dollar closed at 130.88, down 0.52 yen from the previous
day's 131.40-yen finish. The currency started trading at 130.73 yen
and moved in a range of 130.60-130.91 yen.
   Currency traders said the dollar's weakness at the start of
trading followed an overnight decline in New York after a U.S.
government report indicated economic growth was slowing.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Wednesday that American
factory orders for major durable goods fell 3.6 percent in February,
the second consecutive monthly decline and the largest drop in seven
months.
   On the stock exchange, share prices rebounded following the
Commerce Department report, said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko
Sercurities. He said the figure, which indicates a slowdown in the
U.S. economy, wiped away some worries of interest rate hikes.
   ``Although there are still some concerns over inflation, a series
of economic indicators released recently seemed to be at least
encouraging for the stock market,'' Shimoyama said.
   The U.S. consumer price index released Tuesday grew 0.4 percent
in February, compared to 0.6 percent in January.

<HEAD>Government Asks West to Reopen Embassies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has appealed to the
United States and other western countries to reopen their embassies,
saying the country has not become a ``bloodbath'' after the Soviet
withdrawal as had been feared.
   A Foreign Ministry statement containing the appeal was read to
foreign reporters on Wednesday. Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi
Amani said it would be delivered to the United Nations.
   The United States and 11 other western nations closed their
embassies in January and February as the Red Army completed its
withdrawal after nine years of helping the Marxist Kabul regime
fight U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas.
   The insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978.
   Speaking to a group of about 20 foreign journalists, Amani
repeated official allegations that closing the embassies was a
propaganda maneuver designed to undermine the Kabul government and
boost guerrilla morale.
   Amani, whose remarks were translated by aides from Dari into
English, said the embassies were closed ``on a pretext of insecurity
and they were saying after the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan will
change to a bloodbath. The last 40 days have demonstrated that this
was not correct.''
   The ministry statement specifically asked the United States, as a
guarantor of the U.N.-sponsored agreement under which the Soviets
withdrew, to reopen its embassy.
   Remaining U.S. Embassy staff members were evacuated Jan. 31 and
the 11 other embassies also closed, including those of Britain,
France and Japan.
   Only 19 diplomatic missions have remained open in Kabul since the
last Soviet soldiers left on Feb. 15.
   After the Soviets were gone, the insurgents launched a major
offensive against government troops in Jalalabad, 75 miles east of
the capital. Kabul has come under rocket attack, but not to the
extent of last year.
   Amani said 159 guerrillas, eight Afghan soldiers and 10 civilians
had been killed in the battle for Jalalabad in the previous 24
hours, but said he did not have total casualties in the fighting,
which began March 6.
   Reports on official Kabul Radio put the death toll since the
battle began at more than 1,900, but guerrilla accounts of their own
casualties usually are only about 10 percent of those claimed by
Kabul.
   Residents of Kabul say government troops in the city have been
firing Soviet-made Scud-B missiles toward Jalalabad daily. The
missiles have a range of at least 175 miles.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the insurgents had fired at least 50,000 rockets at Jalalabad.
   Huge Soviet Ilyushin-76 transports have landed with increasing
frequency at Kabul's airport during the battle for Jalalabad, which
is considered strategic because it is on the highway that connects
Kabul and the Pakistani border.
   Staff members of U.N. agencies said they counted 112 landings by
the Ilyusihins last week and 109 by smaller Antonov-12s.
   When asked what the planes brought, Amani said they were
``Aeroflot cargo planes carrying supplies from the United Nations.''
He said they were bringing part of the $600 million in food and
medicine pledged by the Soviet Union to a $2 billion U.N. relief
program.
   Leon de Reidmatten, the U.N. aid representative in Kabul,
responded: ``We have not been informed about this'' and noted that
all supplies intended for the program must be distribted through
U.N. offices.
   Douglas Manson of the U.N. Development Program said he did not
know what the Soviet aircraft were hauling.
   Noting that an Ilyushin can carry 40 tons of cargo and an Antonov
six tons, he said: ``If they're bringing food, none of it is showing
up in the silos and marketplaces.''
   Afghanistan has said it will continue to receive military
supplies from the Soviet Union as long as the United States arms the
guerrillas.

   Allen H. Neuharth will resign down from the
board of directors of Gannett Co. Inc. on April 27, a move that
follows his retirement as chairman of the media giant at the end of
the month.
   ``I am convinced that when a retired former CEO remains on the
board of directors of a corporation, his@her mere presence is often
an inhibiting factor,'' Neuharth said Wednesday in a statement
released from corporate headquarters in suburban Arlington, Va. ``I
do not wish to risk bridling either my successor or the board in any
way.''
   The board resignation will take effect at the annual
shareholders' meeting in Chicago.
   Neuhart, who turned 65 Wednesday, will be succeeded as chairman
by John J. Curley, president and chief executive officer of Gannett.
   Neuharth has been a director on Gannett's board since 1964.
Neuharth remains chairman of the Gannett Foundation, which moves
from Rochester, N.Y., to the Washington area next fall. He also will
continue to write his weekly columnm for the Friday editions of USA
Today.
   In making his announcement to the board of directors, which met
here Wednesday, Neuharth said: ``As you know, my primary purpose for
the past couple of years has been to make certain that the
transition of management at Gannett be orderly and effective. With
my retirement as chairman next week, and with John Curley succeeding
me, that goal will be achieved.''
   Neuharth's present term as a director expires in 1991. He would
have been eligible for election to another three-year term at that
time.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of a Colombian drug cartel
bribed Nicaraguan officials for use of a military base as a way
station for 3,000 pounds of cocaine before smuggling it into this
country, according to a federal indictment.
   Leaders of the Medellin cartel masterminded the slayings of the
Colombian justice minister and a U.S. drug informant, according to
the federal District Court indictment unsealed Wednesday.
   The indictment accuses 30 people, including an associate of the
Bahamian prime minister, of participating in a ring that imported 22
tons of cocaine _ $1 billion worth _ into the United States.
   ``This is an encompassing indictment that talks about the whole
system of importing cocaine from Colombia through the Bahamas to the
United States beginning in about 1974 and continuing into 1989,''
said Jack Hook, a DEA spokesman.
   Those indicted are tied to Carlos Lehder Rivas, the Colombian
drug kingpin who was convicted in Jacksonville last year of
smuggling cocaine into the United States.
   ``This prosecution will further dismantle the Medellin cartel and
its distribution network in the United States,'' U.S. Attorney
Robert W. Genzman said of the latest indictments.
   The cartel, named for the Colombian city where it is based, is
considered the world's largest cocaine trafficking ring. It's said
to be responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into
the United States.
   The indictment accuses reputed cartel leader Pablo Escobar
Gaviria of organizing the 1984 assassination of Colombian Justice
Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Escobar and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez also
directed the 1986 slaying of former Drug Enforcement Administration
informant Barry Seal, the indictment charges.
   After the minister's slaying, cartel leaders fled the South
American country and eventually traveled to Nicaragua, the
indictment said. They stored 3,000 pounds of cocaine at Los Brasiles
Air Force Base in the leftist-ruled country before flying it into
the United States, the indictment said.
   In May 1984, Lehder and other cartel leaders arranged to pay
Nicaraguan officials large sums of money to allow them to remain in
the Central American nation and to use it as a base for smuggling
cocaine to the United States, the indictment said. In addition, in
July 1984, a Piper Navajo owned by Lehder was given to the
Nicaraguan government as a gift, the indictment said.
   Also indicted was Everette Bannister, a close associate of
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling. Bannister was accused of
taking money from the cartel to allow the island nation off
Florida's shores to be used as a way station for drug imports.
   Bannister's telephone in Nassau was busy during repeated calls
from The Associated Press. Bill Kalis, a spokesman for Pindling's
office, said the Bahamian government would have no comment on
Bannister's indictment.
   NBC News, citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials,
reported that an early draft of the indictment said Bannister shared
the alleged payoffs with Pindling and other Bahamian officials.
Pindling's name was dropped from the indictment after it was
reviewed by the Justice and State departments in Washington, NBC
said. The network did not say whether the early draft named Pindling
as a defendant.
   Genzman refused to answer questions about continuing allegations
that Pindling was involved. He did say that the United States has an
extradition treaty with the Bahamas and would seek Bannister's
extradition.
   Other major figures indicted were reputed cartel kingpins Jose
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Ochoa's brother Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and
Gonzalo Mejia. Most of the cartel members were earlier indicted in
Miami but have not been arrested.
   Also indicted was Jack Carlton Reed, a pilot who is serving a
15-year prison sentence for his conviction with Lehder.
   Escobar, Rodriguez, Mejia, Reed and the Ochoa brothers are
accused of running a continuing criminal enterprise _ punishable by
a maximum life sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs.
   Lehder, an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment, is
serving a life sentence.
   Only five of those indicted were arrested: Yemel Nacel of New
York City, who is Lehder's former wife; Barry Kane, a Hyannis,
Mass., attorney; Jeffrey Edward Lewis of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.;
Diane Helen Thornhill and Donald Gary Podesto of California,
authorities said.
   Last April, the Columbian Supreme Court negated a 1979
extradition treaty with the United States on a constitutional
technicality.
   Genzman noted that it took the U.S. government six years to get
Lehder to this country.
   ``I am confident that in some point in time we will be able to
obtain custody of the others,'' he said.

<HEAD>Britain Wants Bill Right Of Rights For Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
is proposing a bill of rights for Hong Kong to ensure civil
liberties are protected there after China takes over the British
colony in 1997.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe proposed the idea on
Wednesday during a meeting of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Questioned about prospects for human rights in light of China's
suppression of recent nationalist demonstrations in Tibet, Howe
noted that drafts of a new constitution for Hong Kong have not yet
addressed the issue out in detail.
   He said despite Beijing's commitment to observe international
conventions on human rights, ``it may be desirable to consolidate
the (human rights) provisions of international covenants into a Hong
Kong Bill of Rights.''
   Hong Kong Governor Sir David Wilson told the committee that
Britain and China would ensure that Hong Kong has a system of
representative government but said its development would be gradual.
Britain plans to hold Hong Kong's first democratic elections in 1991.
   Asked if a bill of rights was planned, Wilson said: ``It's
certainly one of the things we'll want to look at'' in the final
version of Hong Kong's new constitution.
   He said the proposed constitution calls for enforcing
international covenants on human rights through the laws of Hong
Kong, ensuring that same rights and freedoms that now exist will be
protected when the colony becomes a ``special administrative
region'' of China in 1997.
   The committee was meeting for an update on the status of the 1984
Sino-British agreement that will transfer Hong Kong to Chinese
jurisdiction. A key part of its implementation is the drafting of
the constitution, known as the Basic Law. A committee composed of
Hong Kong and Chinese members has completed a second draft of the
law.
   China has promised that Hong Kong's capitalist system and
lifestyle will remain unchanged for 50 years after the transfer of
sovereignty.
   Wilson told the committee, which will visit Hong Kong and Beijing
next month, that plans still are under way to have elections in Hong
Kong.
   ``There's no change of objective,'' Wilson said, reiterating
plans to have 10 members elected by universal suffrage to the
Legislative Council in 1991 for three-year terms and an additional
15 to an enlarged council of 80 in 1995.
   Until now, the only elected members of the Council have been
elected from limited groups.
   ``The whole process is one of steady and gradual evolution of
representative government,'' he said.

   A 14-year-old girl is back home today
after winning an age discrimination battle but says she can't
forgive the elderly neighbors who forced her eviction from a mobile
home community.
   ``I'm glad to be home,'' Staci Elmer said Wednesday after a judge
allowed her to return to her parents' home in this rural central
Florida town.
   ``But my family was separated. I don't care if the neighbors got
down on their knees and apologized. I don't think I could look them
in the eye and forgive them. It hurt that much.''
   Neighbors waged a court battle for more than a year to enforce a
deed restriction on the Elmer's property and other homes in the
two-block subdivision. The deed banned children under age 15.
   They won an injunction in January, and Staci was kicked out of
her family's home Jan. 31 after Pasco Circuit Judge Wayne Cobb
threatened to jail her parents for contempt. The teen-ager went to
live with a married brother several miles away, coming home to visit
on weekends.
   But Cobb ruled Wednesday that the ban was rendered illegal by a
federal housing law that took effect March 12.
   ``This court cannot continue an injunction in violation of the
law. The federal act now makes these deed restrictions unlawful and
I'm going to dissolve the injunction,'' Cobb said at the end of a
brief hearing.
   The federal housing law is controversial in many retirement
communities, where some residents say they're entitled to live
quietly and without children.
   All of the Elmers' neighbors who occupy the 16 other mobile homes
in the small subdivision are retirees in their 60s, 70s and 80s.
   The long court battle left bitterness on both sides.
   ``I just feel we've been taken,'' said Arlene Murray, who lives
across the street from Beverly and Thomas Elmer. ``We bought here 20
years ago with the idea of peace and quiet. We raised our family.
Our grandchildren are raised.
   ``It isn't that we are against children,'' she said. ``Out of 17
families, it comes down to the fact that 16 don't have any rights _
I don't think that's fair.''
   ``I really don't care if they like me or not,'' said Mrs. Elmer,
45. ``There are some gray-haired monsters here.''
   Mrs. Elmer, who sells real estate, admits she knew about the age
restriction before buying the property, but liked the area because
it was affordable and convenient to work and school.
   Other residents violated deed restrictions governing placement of
clotheslines and propane tanks, she said, so she didn't think Staci
would be a problem when the family moved in in November 1987.
   Neighbors said they weren't sure whether they would continue
their fight. Most live on a pension and don't have the funds for a
long legal battle, and carrying on the dispute may be too stressful
for those who are in frail health, Mrs. Murray said.
   Staci will turn 15 on April 7 and would be allowed to stay then
anyway. Still, she said she was surprised by the judge's ruling and
didn't think her battle had ended.
   ``For the most part I was shocked. I don't think it's over _
maybe for the judicial system, but not for the neighborhood,'' she
said.

   As her former companion, Joel Steinberg,
awaits sentencing in the death of their illegally adopted daughter,
Hedda Nussbaum is preparing to leave a psychiatric hospital and
rebuild her life.
   Since November 1987, doctors have worked to repair physical and
mental wounds she said she incurred during the 11 years she shared a
New York City apartment with Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer.
   She underwent surgery for physical injuries and was kept for a
time in a locked unit with the criminally insane.
   Now, ``she's about ready to go out on her own,'' said Dr. Samuel
Klagsbrun, executive medical director of Four Winds Hospital in
suburban Westchester County, where she has been living since March
1988.
   ``We're doing discharge planning for her now,'' he said. ``There
are details to work out.''
   The actual release could occur within a month, but Klagsbrun said
she must still decide how to resume her life, including where she
will live and what kind of job she wants. He said Ms. Nussbaum was
not available for an interview.
   ``Right now, release depends on the practical matters,'' said
Klagsbrun. ``She has to look for some work to support herself, just
like the rest of us.''
   Ms. Nussbaum had worked as a children's book editor, a job from
which she was fired after repeatedly missing work. She has a $3.6
million civil lawsuit pending against Steinberg.
   At first, Ms. Nussbaum was charged along with Steinberg in the
beating death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg in November 1987.
   At the time, Ms. Nussbaum's lips were split and swollen, her
broken nose had an ulcer on the bridge and a clump of hair appeared
to have been snatched from her head. She was bruised and wounds on
her legs were badly ulcerated and infected. She walked with a stoop
and her hair was matted and gray.
   Charges against her were dropped when prosecutors determined she
was too physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for
the girl's death.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, testified under immunity as the star
prosecution witness in Steinberg's trial, during which defense
attorneys contended she was responsible for Lisa's fatal beating.
   A jury convicted Steinberg in January of manslaughter, rejecting
a murder charge because, as one juror said, Ms. Nussbaum could have
saved Lisa's life.
   Steinberg's sentencing is Friday. He could receive a maximum
prison term of eight to 25 years.
   During the past year, Ms. Nussbaum has undergone individual and
group therapy, psychodrama therapy and what Klagsbrun called
``expressive therapy.''
   ``She's done a lot of photography and artwork,'' he said. She
will need to participate in outpatient support groups once she is
released, Klagsbrun said.
   Ms. Nussbaum was returning from a support group meeting March 13
when she received two traffic tickets _ for driving with an expired
license and for failing to keep right.
   Klagsbrun said the license had expired because her mail had not
been properly forwarded. The license was renewed the day after she
was ticketed. She pleaded guilty and will be fined a maximum $100
next week.
   The Steinberg case focused national attention on domestic
violence and the question of who should report cases of suspected
child abuse.
   Janet Segal, director of clinical services at Four Winds,
testified at trial that Ms. Nussbaum's situation was like being a
prisoner of war. She also likened it to the battered spouse
syndrome, in which victims suffer ``an erosion of spirit, of will,
of judgment.''

   A congressional report charges that American
arms produced jointly with U.S. allies were sold to countries
``patently unfriendly'' to the United States, violating a U.S. ban
on third-country sales.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found
that the United States had 18 coproduction agreements with six
countries _ West Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Korea and
Switzerland _ and that three of those countries violated the pacts.
   The GAO would not release the names of the three countries in the
report issued Wednesday. But it did say that the breaches involved
in agreements covering tanks, helicopters, Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles and ammunition.
   The State Department, which is responsible for handling incidents
of noncompliance, took some action on the cases, the GAO said.

   The Army has narrowed to four the number of
bases under consideration to become the home to an expanded infantry
training range.
   The service said Wednesday, said the four finalists included Fort
Stewart, Ga.; Fort Chaffee, Ark.; Fort McCoy, Wis., and Fort Lewis,
Wash.
   The Army disclosed the four in announcing it would soon launch an
environmental impact study for expansion of what it calls the Joint
Readiness Training Center.
   ``The proposal will involve (the stationing of) approximately
2,000 permanently assigned personnel and training support to about
35,000 rotating unit personnel,'' the service continued.
   The Army currently operates the JRTC at Fort Chaffee, but
considers that facility too small for modern-day infantry training.

   The National Education Association says the
average salary for American teachers grew slightly faster than
inflation in the past year, rising to $29,567 for the current school
year.
   The figure represented a 5.6 percent increase over the $28,044
average salary during the 1987-88 school year, the group said on
Wednesday. Inflation over the same period hovered at about 4.5
percent.
   Current average salaries range from a high of $41,693 in Alaska
to a low of $20,480 in South Dakota.
   According to the teachers union, the average gain in real
purchasing power for public teacher salaries is estimated at 12.3
percent for the period 1978-79 to 1988-89. That's an
inflation-adjusted gain of $1,844 over the decade.

   Commonly prescribed arthritis and
pain-relieving drugs pose a serious risk of peptic ulcers,
intestinal perforations and other gastrointestinal problems, the
Food and Drug Administration is warning.
   The FDA is requiring manufacturers to add to their labels a
warning reporting that studies show up to 4 percent of patients on
long-term therapy with these drugs may have serious gastrointestinal
reactions.
   The new labeling announced Wednesday is required for Voltaren,
Nalfon, Tolectin, Indocin, Dolobid, Meclomen, Feldene, Ponstel,
Anaprox, Naprosyn, Orudis, Butazolidin, Rufen, Motrin, Ansaid and
several generic versions of ibuprofen, indomethacin and
phenylbutazone.
   Nonprescription ibuprofen does not have to carry the new warning
because the risk of serious reactions with over-the-counter products
appears to be ``much less, particularly if they are taken as
directed over a shorter period of time,'' the FDA said.

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound In Tokyo, Dollar Off Slightly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rebounded today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange after four consecutive losing days, while the U.S. dollar
was off slightly against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 211.56-point loser
Wednesday, recouped 145.42 points, or 0.46 percent, to finish at
31,588.66.
   Although the market's key index suffered some setbacks as
speculative investors sold issues for profit-taking in the afternoon
session, the Nikkei maintained earlier gains as other participants
traded a variety of issues, dealers said.
   ``The foreign exchange market that has been stabilized for the
last couple of days and oil prices that don't seem to be rising
further were two encouraging factors for the Nikkei's rise today,''
said a broker with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   Trading was moderate with volume estimated at 800 million shares.
Among the winners were steel and department store issues.
   In currency dealings, the dollar ended trading at 130.88 yen,
down 0.52 yen from the previous day's 131.40-yen finish. The
currency started trading lower at 130.73 yen and moved in a range of
130.60-130.91 yen.
   The dollar's lower start in Tokyo followed a similar trend in New
York overnight after comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan and a government figure on factory orders for durable
goods Wednesday.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported American factory orders for
major durable goods fell 3.6 percent in February, the second
consecutive monthly decline and the largest drop in seven months.
   Recent economic reports have indicated some softening of the
economy in February. Retail sales, industrial production and orders
for durable goods lasting for more than three years have all fallen.
   Greenspan, in response to a question at a House Banking
Subcommittee hearing, said the conditions that led to interest rates
in the high teens in the 1980s are not present today.
   ``It's our view that the actions we have taken to date probably
have made interest rates, certainly in the long end of the market,
significantly lower than they would have otherwise been,'' he said.
   An analyst with a commercial bank in Tokyo said, ``The dollar-yen
rate hardly moved after it marked 130.88 at the end of the morning
session.''
   He said trading became thin as a majority of participants stepped
to the sidelines before the Easter holidays in New York and European
markets, in addition to a general lack of market incentives.
   The New York market is closed for a three-day weekend starting
Friday, while the London market reopens on Tuesday.

<HEAD>North Korea Defectors Say Countrymen Brainwashed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two defectors from North Korea said
today that there is little public resistance in their former country
to the transfer of power from President Kim Il Sung to his son.
   The North Koreans, both students, were studying in Czechoslovakia
when they defected on Feb. 13.
   ``All people in the north are brainwashed to believe that Kim
Jong Il (Kim Il Sung's son) is a genius and they, therefore, think
he must succeed to his father,'' one of the students, Cho Sung-kun,
told a news conference.
   ``But I think Kim Jong Il is a bum and most Czechoslovakians I
have met said the succession problem shows that North Korea is not a
communist nation, but a feudal state,'' he said.
   Other North Koreans have defected while traveling abroad but the
defection of Cho, 22, and Kim Un-chui, 23, was the first time North
Korean students who had studied abroad have defected.
   Both had attended a medical college in Prague.
   North Korean official radio broadcasts confirmed the students'
defection and said they were ``dopes who did not like to study.''
   Kim Il Sung, 76, has ruled North Korea for four decades, building
a personality cult that has virtually deified him in his country and
maintaining strict isolationist policies.
   He has designated his eldest son as his successor, creating the
world's first communist dynasty.
   Kim Il Sung He became premier in 1948, commanded North Korea
forces in the 1950-53 Korean War and was named president in 1972.
   Cho, a son of a North Korean army colonel, said that after living
in Czecholovakia for nearly two years he realized that leaders of
the Pyongyang government were lying to their people about the
outside world, especially South Korea.
   ``In Czechoslovakia, we knew by publications that South Korea is
one of the fastest developing economies and is rich enough to hold
the Olympics. This is quite contrary to what has been known in the
north,'' he said.

<HEAD>Britain Wants Bill Right Of Rights For Hong Kong</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT typo in slug line.</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
is proposing a bill of rights for Hong Kong to ensure civil
liberties are protected there after China takes over the British
colony in 1997.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe proposed the idea on
Wednesday during a meeting of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Questioned about prospects for human rights in light of China's
suppression of recent nationalist demonstrations in Tibet, Howe
noted that drafts of a new constitution for Hong Kong have not yet
addressed the issue out in detail.
   He said despite Beijing's commitment to observe international
conventions on human rights, ``it may be desirable to consolidate
the (human rights) provisions of international covenants into a Hong
Kong Bill of Rights.''
   Hong Kong Governor Sir David Wilson told the committee that
Britain and China would ensure that Hong Kong has a system of
representative government but said its development would be gradual.
Britain plans to hold Hong Kong's first democratic elections in 1991.
   Asked if a bill of rights was planned, Wilson said: ``It's
certainly one of the things we'll want to look at'' in the final
version of Hong Kong's new constitution.
   He said the proposed constitution calls for enforcing
international covenants on human rights through the laws of Hong
Kong, ensuring that same rights and freedoms that now exist will be
protected when the colony becomes a ``special administrative
region'' of China in 1997.
   The committee was meeting for an update on the status of the 1984
Sino-British agreement that will transfer Hong Kong to Chinese
jurisdiction. A key part of its implementation is the drafting of
the constitution, known as the Basic Law. A committee composed of
Hong Kong and Chinese members has completed a second draft of the
law.
   China has promised that Hong Kong's capitalist system and
lifestyle will remain unchanged for 50 years after the transfer of
sovereignty.
   Wilson told the committee, which will visit Hong Kong and Beijing
next month, that plans still are under way to have elections in Hong
Kong.
   ``There's no change of objective,'' Wilson said, reiterating
plans to have 10 members elected by universal suffrage to the
Legislative Council in 1991 for three-year terms and an additional
15 to an enlarged council of 80 in 1995.
   Until now, the only elected members of the Council have been
elected from limited groups.
   ``The whole process is one of steady and gradual evolution of
representative government,'' he said.

   Ten years after Three Mile Island, officials
who faced the nation's largest nuclear emergency vividly recall a
time of fear one says he'll never forget ``as long as I live.''
   There was the fear on the faces of expectant mothers, evacuation
plans in which two counties used the same bridge but in the opposite
directions, the U.S. Army Signal Corps building phone lines and the
White House trying to commandeer lead bricks from the military.
   ``You really don't want to revisit this event. You hope you or
anyone else never has to deal with it again,'' said U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh. ``This whole event was like a roller
coaster. You didn't know when it was going to stop or when it was
going to end.''
   Thornburgh was in his 72nd day as governor of Pennsylvania on
March 28, 1979, when the worst commercial nuclear accident in U.S.
history riveted world attention on a power plant 10 miles south of
Harrisburg.
   At a reunion dinner Wednesday night, Thornburgh was host for
those who faced what he said was ``something that had never happened
before on the face of the earth, when the worst fear of modern man
almost came to pass.''
   The participants swapped stories about the lack of reliable
information, the response of government and the complexity of making
steam by splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor.
   ``If it goes wrong, there's no human capability of dealing with
it. The bottom line is we were very lucky at Three Mile Island,''
said Eugene Eidenberg, an assistant to former President Carter.
   Other White House staffers recalled the difficulty in getting
accurate details about an accident in which a series of mechanical
breakdowns and human error robbed the reactor of cooling water and
released radioactivity into the air.
   ``What we really had to fear was what we didn't know,'' said
Jessica Mathews, a staffer on Carter's National Security Council.
``We were in the dark. We really didn't know what we were talking
about.''
   ``No one really knew what was going on,'' said Jack Watson, who
was White House counsel at the time.
   At the peak of the crisis, when some federal officials were
urging a general evacuation of residents, Thornburgh pleaded with
Carter to ``send me one good man, somebody who can translate this
foreign, technical information.''
   That man was Harold Denton, chief of operating reactors at the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He traveled by helicopter to the
site and brought ``instant credibility,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``One of the things we learned was you can't manage a crisis from
100 miles away,'' Denton said. He called TMI and the accident at
Chernobyl in the Soviet Union ``a reminder of the downside of
nuclear power if it's not successful.''
   Two days after the accident, Thornburgh wrestled with the
decision of having to order a general evacuation. After gleaning
information from his staff between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., he advised
pregnant women and young children living within five miles of the
plant to leave.
   ``I will never forget that hour as long as I live,'' Thornburgh
said.
   Much of the dinner talk recalled fears about a hydrogen bubble
that formed in the reactor. Robert Wilburn, former director of the
state's office of management and budget, remembered a report about
the NRC saying the bubble was becoming potentially explosive.
   ``You could hear the sounds of the cars starting up and leaving
the city,'' Wilburn said.
   Two dozen reporters stormed into the governor's office at that
time and wanted to know if they should leave too. ``They weren't
worried about reporting the story anymore. They were worried about
their own safety,'' said Paul Critchlow, Thornburgh's former press
secretary.
   Former Lt. Gov. William Scranton III, now a private businessman
in California, recalled the optimistic statements from Metropolitan
Edison Co., the plant's owner, which downplayed the seriousness of
the near-catastrophe.
   ``I got this sinking feeling like a stone out of an airplane that
this was bigger than any of us thought,'' Scranton said.
   No one from the utility was invited to the reunion.

<HEAD>Girl Cannot Be Forced To Take Genetic Tests To Prove Parentage, Court
Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old girl cannot be forced to have
genetic tests to determine her parentage just because a Pennsylvania
couple says she is their natural daughter lost in a baby swap, an
appeals court has ruled.
   The ruling Wednesday by the Second District Court of Appeal here
was a major setback in the legal battle Ernest and Regina Twigg of
Langhorne, Pa., are waging to prove the girl is their daughter.
   The Twiggs contend the girl was swapped in the hospital days
after her birth for a sickly child who later died.
   But the court ruled that genetic testing of the Sarasota girl,
Kimberly Mays, would deny her ``privacy and freedom from unjustified
humiliation and psychological damage.''
   ``They ruled with me every which way,'' said Arthur Ginsburg,
attorney for Kimberly and the father who raised her, Robert Mays.
``I'm thrilled about it.''
   Kimberly was also happy with the decision, Ginsburg said.
   But the Twiggs' attorney, John Blakely, said: ``The court seems
to have totally ignored the anguish that Mr. and Mrs. Twigg have,
knowing they have a child somewhere in the world that they have
never seen.''
   Blakely said he plans to ask the full panel of judges to
reconsider the opinion. If they refuse, he plans to take the case to
the Florida Supreme Court.
   If Wednesday's ruling holds, the Twiggs will have to file a new
motion explaining why they want to know if Kimberly is their
daughter. And their reason cannot be ``merely to satisfy their
curiosity,'' according to the appeals court ruling.
   Attorneys for boths sides agreed that the Twiggs' next step would
be to seek custody of Kimberly, or the right to visit the girl.
   If the court rules that the Twiggs don't have those rights, the
question of genetic tests would become irrelevant.
   ``Admittedly, natural parents have certain presumptive rights of
custody as to their offspring,'' the court said. ``Those rights,
however, are not absolute. Children are not property, but
individuals whose needs and physical and mental well-being find
protection in the law.''
   Ginsburg filed testimony from mental health experts who said
Kimberly would be severely disturbed if she were forced to visit the
Twiggs or undergo genetic tests.
   The ruling is the latest twist in a case which began more than a
decade ago in Hardee Memorial Hospital.
   The girl the Twiggs brought home from the hospital, Arlena, died
of a congenital heart condition last summer, and the couple now
believes Arlena was actually the child of Robert and Barbara Mays,
who died seven years ago.
   Blood tests performed before Arlena died proved she could not
have been the Twiggs' biological daughter.
   Last fall, Blakely said the Twiggs would seek custody of
Kimberly, in part because they believed Mays had participated in the
baby swap.
   But recently they softened their position, saying they would like
to get to know Kimberly but wouldn't seek to take her away from the
only father she has ever known.

<TEXT>
   The students of the Penn Johns School for
Amish and Mennonite children spent their recess soaking up the
spring sun and talking about the important man who had just stopped
by.
   ``He looked different than in the pictures,'' said Ellis Reiff, a
third-grader at the two-room schoolhouse, shortly after President
Bush and his entourage went bounding back down the winding, country
roads of southeastern Pennsylvania to their next destination.
   ``He looked a little older,'' Ellis added, as some of his many
cousins with the same last name nodded.
   Wearing a blue windbreaker, dark blue pants and a short-brimmed
hat with a scoop in the middle, Ellis and his classmates said they
would have to watch neighbors' televisions Wednesday evening to see
if they made the national news. Their Amish beliefs forbid them from
owning television sets or radios.
   ``When he came into the room, I couldn't believe my eyes,'' said
Ivan Reiff, a fourth-grader.
   Both boys spoke with Pennsylvania Dutch accents.
   Some of the boys said they would like to be president one day,
but conceded that their futures would probably be linked to family
farms since their beliefs also prevent them from holding public
office.
   Bush spoke briefly with the school's 55 children in first through
eighth grades and then met with about a dozen Amish and Mennonite
leaders for about 30 minutes. The president chatted with the
students about his dog's puppies, his trip to Asia, and how his
large staff of Secret Service agents keeps him safe.
   The children said he mentioned nothing of the only thing he had
talked about before and after his meeting with them: the nation's
drug problem.
   Earlier in the day, Bush spoke to about 3,500 students and guests
in the stuffed-to-capacity Conestoga Valley High School gymnasium.
After leaving the Amish school, he traveled to Wilmington, Del., to
meet with community organizations fighting drug abuse.
   Ben Martin, an Old Order Mennonite minister, stood in stark
contrast to the giggling, red-cheeked schoolchildren when he
discussed the meeting with Bush.
   Amish historians believe the meeting could be the first with a
sitting president and members of their community, which is more
traditional than the Mennonite sect, from which it separated in the
17th century.
   Martin, 57, a farmer by profession, said the leaders told Bush
their strong family ties and emphasis on religion helped keep
children and teen-agers away from drugs.
   But, he added, the Amish and Mennonite communities are not
perfect.
   ``We realize we are just human like everybody else and we don't
want to forget that,'' he said.
   Martin said the president shook hands with each of them and even
remembered his first name when saying goodbye.
   ``He was a down-to-earth president,'' Martin said.
   Elmer Burkholder, 44, a father of three of the children who
attend Penn Johns, said he was nervous talking with the nation's
chief executive, but overcame the jitters when he ``kept on
talking.''
   Burkholder said he told the president of how his two sons, ages
18 and 22, had been offered drugs.
   ``The children are taught values from the parents and those are
passed on,'' he said. ``I was thankful that my sons were able to
withstand the temptation.''
   The president, accompanied at the meeting by Attorney General and
former Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh and Bush's drug control
policy director, William J. Bennett, told the leaders their
community, ``is a shining example of what family and faith can do.''

   A different kind of animal prowled the streets of
New York City in the wee hours today.
   At 1 a.m., the first stage of the procession emerged from the
Queens-Midtown Tunnel onto the dark streets of Manhattan.
   First came the police cars with their flashing lights. Then came
the tigers.
   In cages.
   ``That one was big,'' exclaimed Manhattanite Anita Nirenberg.
``Can you imagine scooping that litter box?''
   About 75 people gathered in the cold clear night and cheered as
the circus came to town.
   ``Ooh'' they said, and ``Aahh.'' And ``Uh oh'' as the odd empty
tiger cage passed.
   The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus animals travel by
train to Queens, then march through the tunnel and across Manhattan
to Madison Square Garden. Trucks pull the tiger cages.
   The procession included about 20 elephants, some with riders and
many linked trunk-to-tail. Next came teams of prancing white horses
and a pair of camels, then pairs of llamas and black ponies.
   One of the parade spectators, Jackie Markland, said she journeyed
all the way from the eastern tip of Long Island but doubted she'd
buy a ticket to see the real show.
   ``I actually don't like the circus,'' she said.

   A teen-ager accused of killing his
parents and younger brother owned a variety of military
paraphernalia and told police his nickname was ``Rambo'',
authorities said.
   Brian Britton, 16, pleaded innocent Wednesday to three counts of
second-degree murder. He also pleaded innocent to one count of
second-degree attempted murder for allegedly wounding his
18-year-old sister, Sherry Britton, at their home in the nearby Town
of Poughkeepsie.
   He was held without bail.
   Miss Britton was in stable condition late Wednesday after surgery
for head and chest wounds, according to a nursing supervisor at
Vassar Brothers Hospital.
   Killed in the shooting spree were Dennis Britton, 44, his wife,
Marlene, 42, and 8-year-old Jason Britton.
   Town of Poughkeepsie police displayed two guns they believe were
used in the shootings, a 20-gauge shotgun and a 12-gauge
semiautomatic shotgun. The weapons were found in the attic of the
Britton home, police said.
   Also on display during a news conference was a range of military
paraphernalia, including canteens, army fatigues, canvas ammunition
packs, a copy of Soldier of Fortune magazine and a smoke grenade,
which belonged to Brian Britton, police said.
   The teen-ager also had Rambo posters in his room and a magazine
from the ``Rambo III'' movie, about the Vietnam War veteran
portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, police said.
   ``I'd say he had a definite fixation on Rambo and military
activity and military life,'' said Town of Poughkeepsie Police Chief
Stanley Still Jr.
   Still said police think the shootings may have been sparked by a
running argument in the household over school work.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for three white students didn't
prove they were discriminated against when Dartmouth College
suspended them after a confrontation with a black professor, said a
judge who dismissed the case.
   U.S. District Judge Shane Devine concluded the students were
``not entitled to relief under any set of facts they could prove.''
   Sean Gorman, an attorney for Dartmouth, said Wednesday the ruling
vindicated his claim the lawsuit was ``a public relations stunt.''
   A companion lawsuit is pending in a state court, however, and one
of the students' lawyers said Wednesday that the real action will be
there.
   ``The focus of our efforts ... has always been the First
Amendment (free-speech) claim in the state court,'' said Art
Ruegger. ``We're looking forward to a trial in front of a jury on
those claims.''
   The plaintiffs _ Christopher Baldwin of Hinsdale, Ill., John
Sutter of St. Louis, and John Quilhot of Fort Wayne, Ind. _ worked
for The Dartmouth Review, an off-campus weekly newspaper that is
criticized as racist, sexist and anti-homosexual. Defenders call it
a courageous bastion of conservatism and traditional values
persecuted by a liberal campus.
   At issue in the lawsuits was a February 1988 classroom
confrontation between the three and William Cole, a black music
professor described by a Review article as part of ``Dartmouth's
Dynamic Duo of Mediocrity.''
   Though the students accused Cole of grabbing Quilhot by the arm
and breaking the flash on his camera during the angry encounter, a
campus disciplinary board found them guilty of harassing him, and
they were suspended.
   Shortly before the March 1988 suspensions, Dartmouth President
James Freedman spoke at a rally held during the furor triggered by
the incident.
   ``I feel dreadful about the attack on Professor Cole,'' Freedman
said. ``I do not want one minority or woman student to decline to
come to Dartmouth because of the perception that this incident is
representative of the true Dartmouth. It is not.''
   In a ruling issued Tuesday, Devine rejected the students' claim
that those comments and others demonstrated Freedman's bias against
them.
   Though it could be inferred that Freedman believed the students
acted on racial motives in confronting Cole, ``it is not reasonable
to infer that President Freedman's motives in making his comments
were racial ... that the plaintiffs' race was the reason for his
actions,'' Devine said.
   Another of the students' lawyers, Francis Murphy Jr., said the
students may appeal or ask the judge to reconsider.
   Devine noted that state Superior Court Judge Bruce Mohl ruled in
January that he found ``no persuasive evidence'' to support the
students' political discrimination claim.
   In that ruling, Mohl ordered Baldwin and Sutter reinstated
because one member of the panel that disciplined them had been
biased against the Review.
   Dartmouth could have renewed disciplinary action against them,
but did not, and they returned to campus soon afterward. Quilhot
already had completed his six-month suspension.
   Dartmouth spokesman Alex Huppe said all three were off campus
Wednesday for semester break.

   About 130 Vietnamese boat people apparently drowned
after a Japanese tanker collided with their overloaded 30-foot boat
in the South China Sea, Japanese officials reported today.
   Authorities said first reports of the March 8 accident did not
emerge until Monday, when 35 survivors of the accident on the high
seas between Vietnam and Malaysia arrived in the port of Yokohama.
   The refugees said their wooden ship was carrying 165 people when
it struck the propeller of the 239,000-ton Japanese tanker
Nissei-Maru, said Nagasaki refugee center official Masanami
Nakatsukasa. The boat had left Long An in southern Vietnam for
Malaysia on March 4, he said.
   Nakatsukasa quoted the survivors as saying their boat overturned
and sank after it hit the propeller of the tanker while trying to
approach the Japanese ship for help.
   Many passengers were seasick and suffering from a lack of fresh
water after four days at sea, Nakatsukasa quoted them as saying.
   The refugee boat somehow overturned when the tanker's captain,
Yasuo Kawamura, stopped his ship and prepared ladders to let the
refugees come on board, said Hiroshi Hattori, spokesman of Tokyo
Tanker, the Nissei-Maru's agent.
   Hattori denied reports that the boat overturned after hitting the
tanker's propeller.
   The Nissei-Maru crew conducted an all-day search and rescued 35
refugees, then sailed for Singapore, where the refugees were refused
entry, news reports said.
   The refugees then were brought to Yokohama on another Japanese
vessel after the Japan's government granted them entry, said Chikako
Saito, spokeswoman for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
in Tokyo.
   The 35 survivors will stay in the Nagasaki refugee center until
the U.N. High Commissioner representative interviews them, arranges
for health check-ups, and decides on possible resettlement
elsewhere, Nakatuskasa said.
   The Maritime Safety Agency said officials would be sent to the
Nagasaki refugee center to investigate the accident.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said his ministry
viewed the case as ``a really serious issue,'' but could not comment
until the MSA, Japan's coast guard, completed its investigation.

<HEAD>Legislative Committee in W.Va. Recommends Impeaching State Treasurer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PAXTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee has
overwhelmingly recommended that the state treasurer be impeached for
his role in the loss of $279 million from the consolidated
investment fund.
   The legislative committee voted 19-6 Wednesday night to recommend
Treasurer A. James Manchin's impeachment.
   Committee Chairman John Hatcher said one more formal vote is
needed before the impeachment resolution can be sent to the House of
Delegates floor. He gave no timetable for that vote or a related
decision on whether to reprimand state Auditor Glen Gainer.
   If 51 of the 100 House members vote to impeach Manchin, the
popular two-term Democrat will be tried in the state Senate, where
two-thirds approval of the 34 members is needed to remove him from
office.
   The resolution accuses Manchin of neglect of duty, incompetence,
maladministration and high crimes and misdemeanors for either
failing to report the losses, the bulk of which occurred from April
to June 1987, or for failing to supervise his staff.
   Manchin blames his employees, primarily former Associate
Treasurer Arnold Margolin and former Investment Director Kathy
Lester, for the losses. He says he didn't learn of them until
December 1988.
   Manchin was not in his office when the committee voted and a
person who answered his home telephone Wednesday evening said he was
not home.
   Shortly before the committee voted, however, Manchin, 61,
appeared on a television newscast in Charleston.
   ``I've been in public service for 41 years,'' he said. ``Neglect
of duty? I wouldn't know how to neglect duty. I work constantly.''
   After endorsing the impeachment, committee members voted to have
their staff lawyers draft a resolution reprimanding or publicly
censuring Gainer.
   Some committee members were upset when Gainer testified last week
that he delegated many of his duties to his top aide, Don Adams, and
did not take an active interest in Board of Investment activities.
   That board, made up of the treasurer, auditor and governor, sets
general policies for the investment fund, and the treasurer's office
takes charge of day-to-day investments.
   ``He didn't seem to know anything,'' said Delegate Jack Roop.
   ``The Legislature in its wisdom did not put him on the Board of
Investments to be a potted plant,' said Delegate Rick Staton.
   The committee spent more than three hours over two days on a
line-by-line review of the impeachment resolution but engaged in no
debate before the vote.
   It defeated most attempts to weaken or make major modifications
to the impeachment resolution Wednesday but agreed to delete
allegations that Manchin or his staff solicited treasurer's office
employees for campaign contributions, which would violate state law.
   ``If you impeached every elected officer whose subordinates
solicited campaign contributions, you'd have to impeach every
elected official who ever served in the state of West Virginia,''
said Delegate Danny Jones.
   The committee also eliminated an allegation that Manchin asked
Margolin to solicit funds from brokers with which the state did
business.
   ``I think it amounts to an attempted extortion,'' said Delegate
David Grubb, who fought to retain the solicitation allegations.
   Other committee members said no evidence existed that Manchin
knew about or condoned the solicitation of his employees or that his
request of Margolin to seek funds from the brokers broke any laws.
   ``Let's not throw up a bunch of mud on the wall and see what
sticks,'' Staton said.

<TEXT>
   A young woman whose presence provides a
vivid reminder of the long, sometimes violent struggle for Puerto
Rican independence sat quietly at the defense table during the Wells
Fargo robbery trial.
   Her grandfather, Oscar Collazo Lopez, was convicted of trying to
assassinate President Harry S. Truman nearly 40 years ago in a crime
carried out in the name of Puerto Rican independence.
   ``It's more like a personal interest, since I grew up in the
independence movement,'' Loarina DeJesus Collazo, 23, said Wednesday
during a break in closing arguments. ``It's history and, politically
speaking, it's pretty exciting.''
   The government claims that the $7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery
was carried out by Los Macheteros, a violent Puerto Rican
independence group, to finance its revolutionary activities.
   In closing arguments Wednesday, Leonard Weinglass, defense
attorney for the man accused of masterminding the robbery, said his
client knew beforehand about the 1983 robbery, received the money
after the crime and helped the robber escape.
   But Weinglass told the U.S. District Court jury that the
government failed to offer any physical evidence or testimony to
prove that his client, Juan Segarra Palmer, was responsible for the
robbery itself.
   ``He knew what was going to occur. He wanted the robbery to
succeed, but he was not there and the government has not proven he
took steps to help it succeed,'' Weinglass said.
   Segarra and four other men have been on trial since Oct. 11 on
charges stemming from the robbery. Segarra faces 150 years in prison
if convicted on all 16 counts against him.
   For her part, DeJesus volunteered to come to Hartford in May to
work as an interpreter and legal aide to the attorney representing
another defendant, Carlos M. Ayes Suarez, who is accused of using
$20,000 from the 1983 robbery to finance a toy giveaway in Hartford
as a publicity stunt for the group.
   Her grandfather was 36 on Nov. 1, 1950, when he and another
nationalist, Griselio Torresola, tried to shot their way into Blair
House, where Truman was staying while the White House was being
renovated.
   Truman was uninjured, but Collazo's companion and a White House
guard were killed.
   Collazo was sentenced to die in the electric chair, but Truman
commuted his sentence to life in prison in 1952.
   President Carter granted Collazo clemency in 1979 with three
other Puerto Rican nationalists convicted in a 1954 shooting attack
on the U.S. House of Representatives. Five congressmen were wounded
in the attack.
   Collazo, now 75, was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth,
Kan., and is living with his daughter in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.
   ``Surely I am proud of her,'' Collazo said of his granddaughter
in a telephone interview.
   He said he saw no similarity between what he did and what she is
doing except ``for the fact that we are fighting for the same
cause.''
   ``I was (involved) in a violent action. This case is more a
political action than violent action,'' he said.
   DeJesus, who attended Lehman College of the City Univerity of New
York for one year as a psychology major, said she may remain in
Hartford after the current trial ends to assist in the defense of
nine other Wells Fargo defendants still awaiting trial.
   ``I consider it totally political,'' she said of the trial.
``They did it with political and ideological purposes _ if it's true
that they did it.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders MacDonald Not to Exercise Tribal Powers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tribal court has issued a temporary
order prohibiting Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald from exercising
his authority and barring him from his offices.
   Navajo District Judge Robert Yazzie's order late Wednesday told
MacDonald and 27 others not to enter or stay in tribal offices
``except for the purpose of removing personal belongings, unless
further authorized by this court.''
   Yazzie ordered MacDonald and the others to appear before Friday
to show why the order should not be extended indefinitely. Among the
27 named in the order were Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson, press
secretary Tazbah McCullah and Marshall Tome, director of Navajo
public safety.
   ``I feel a sense of relief,'' said interim tribal chairman
Leonard Haskie, who was appointed by the Tribal Council majority two
weeks ago. ``This has been a lengthy and exhausting process.''
   Majority council members, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit Wednesday
asking for a permanent injunction against the chairman.
   Tribal offices were closed late Wednesday, and MacDonald could
not be reached for immediate comment on whether he would obey the
order, which came in response to a motion filed by the council
majority.
   The council placed MacDonald on paid administrative leave last
month following U.S. Senate testimony linking him to alleged graft.
MacDonald contends the council action was illegal and has refused to
leave.
   He has continued to use his office and has changed the locks on
the Tribal Council chambers.
   Yazzie's order banned MacDonald from using tribal funds or
equipment, including airplanes, and from issuing tribal directives
or making contracts.
   Haskie said he was confident tribal police would enforce the
order. Council delegates noted that police are funded by the U.S.
Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has requested that they not take
sides in the dispute.
   However, Tome, head of the police, has been one of MacDonald's
staunchest allies, and police disregarded Yazzie's order last year
prohibiting closure of the Navajo Education and Scholarship
Foundation headed by MacDonald rival Peterson Zah. Police closed off
the building and changed the locks.

   A sheriff says he must have been living on
borrowed time for more than 12 years while his predecessor and three
others plotted to kill him.
   Cyrus ``Bobby'' Tardo, a former Lafourche Parish sheriff, and
three others pleaded guilty Wednesday to planting the homemade bomb
that nearly killed Sheriff Duffy Breaux last December.
   ``It looked like I lived a little bit longer than I thought I was
going to live,'' said the 60-year-old Breaux, who is still on
crutches. ``It was really surprising to hear what went on in the
courtroom today, the testimony that these people gave themselves.''
   Federal prosecutors said the scheme was fueled by political
rivalry, revenge and dreams of unfettered drug trafficking in the
coastal parish, or county, about 40 miles southwest of New Orleans.
   Federal prosecutor Lance Africk said the scheme began in 1976
when Breaux defeated Tardo for sheriff and culminated with the
remote-control detonation of a pipe bomb in the Thibodaux Civic
Center parking lot on Dec. 15, 1988.
   Breaux's left foot was maimed. A part-time deputy was injured in
the blast.
   The four who pleaded guilty were Tardo, 58; Marshall K.
McClendon, 42; Ralph J. Bergeron, 42; and John G. Tullier Jr., 23.
   They were accused of conspiracy, possession of an unregistered
destructive device and damaging a law enforcement vehicle. Tardo
also pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit a violent crime.
   Sentencing was set for May 31. Tardo faces a maximum of 45 years
in prison and $1 million in fines. Tullier, Bergeron and McClendon
each face a maximum of 35 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.
   Tardo, McClendon and Tullier also face state charges of attempted
murder. Authorities said attempted murder charges against Bergeron
had been dropped in exchange for his cooperation.
   In 1979, Tardo made an unsuccessful attempt to unseat Breaux, and
discussed again having the sheriff killed, Africk said.
   ``Tardo's motivation to kill Breaux grew through this time
period. Breaux was Tardo's political enemy and Tardo blamed Breaux
for personal and employment-related failures he suffered,'' Africk
said.
   In 1984, Tardo became president of the parish but he was not
re-elected in 1987. It was then, Africk said, that Tardo and
McClendon, a former police officer in Baton Rouge and New Orleans,
decided to kill Breaux with a bomb.
   McClendon enlisted the help of Bergeron, a former Houma
policeman, and later Tullier to create the remote-control bomb and
plan its use.
   Federal authorities estimate that Tardo paid McClendon a total of
$34,000 over the years to kill Breaux. Several days after the
bombing, Tardo gave McClendon $8,000, most of which went to Tullier
to buy cocaine for sale, Africk said.

   High pressure systems along the New England coast and the
Southwest brought fair weather to much of the western, central and
northeastern parts of the nation this morning.
   Elsewhere, an area of low pressure moving across the northern
Gulf of Mexico spread rain across much of the eastern Gulf Coast
region, the Tennessee Valley and the southern Alantic Coast states.
   Thunderstorms dumped up to an inch of rain across portions of
northern Florida. One to 2 inches of snow were expected over the
northern mountains of North Carolina.
   The difference in air pressure between the high off the New
England coast and the low over the northern Gulf of Mexico produced
strong northeast winds along the North Carolina coast.
   Snow was widely scattered over the northern Rockies and Upper
Michigan, where an inch fell at Sault Saint Marie.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Alabama across to the southern Atlantic Coast and Florida; rain
mixed with snow in western Montana; and light snow in northeast
Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin.
   Highs were predicted to be in the 30s from northern Minnesota to
Upper Michigan and across northern Maine; 40s and 50s from much of
the Atlantic Coast across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the
Great Lakes, the middle Mississippi Valley, southern Minnesota, the
northern Plains and northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest; 80s
in central and southern florida and from southwest Texas to the
Desert Southwest; and 60s to 70s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 5 degrees below zero at
Houlton, Maine, to 76 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   The dollar fell slightly in quiet European trading
today as traders balanced their books ahead of a long Easter weekend
and remained bearish following weak U.S. economic figures.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market continued to take heed
of a lower-than-expected U.S. durable goods figure released
Wednesday. The 3.6 percent fall in new factory orders in February,
instead of an expected 0.6 percent rise, signaled that U.S.
inflation may not be accelerating as rapidly as believed.
   The figures were taken as a further sign of weaker growth in the
U.S. economy.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
1.7265 dollars to buy one pound, more expensive than 1.7225 dollars
late Wednesday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday:
   _1.8635 West German marks, down from 1.8693
   _1.6155 Swiss francs, down from 1.6225
   _6.3165 French francs, down from 6.3345
   _2.1017 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1115
   _1,371.00 Italian lire, down from 1,373.10
   _1.1885 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1897
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 130.88 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted lower at 130.75 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $395.10 a troy ounce, up
from a late bid price of $394.75 a troy ounce Wednesday. At
mid-morning London bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $396.
   In Zurich, gold rose, trading at a bid $395.80 compared with
$393.65 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.30 to close at a bid $396.14.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal

<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak told visiting Israeli
journalists that by always rejecting Arab overtures for peace, their
government is acting as the Arabs did for 40 years.
   ``You are still living in illusion. Everything has changed,''
Mubarak said, sitting surrounded by Israelis in a sunlit garden of a
presidential palace. ``We used to live in illusion before but got no
result.
   ``The Arabs from 1947 until recently have been saying no to every
Israeli suggestion. Now I find you have become like the Arabs of
old: We are saying yes, you are saying no.''
   In December, the Palestine Liberation Organization through its
chairman, Yasser Arafat, renounced terror as a weapon in its fight
for a homeland and recognized for the first time that Israel too has
a right to exist in the Middle East.
   Ezer Weizman, Israel's minister of science and research, sat next
to Mubarak during Wednesday's news conference. Weizman, who had just
held talks with Mubarak, was among several Israeli Cabinit ministers
in Cairo since Sunday for a seminar on Middle East peace.
   The session occurred days before the 10th anniversary on Sunday
of Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, still the only peace accord
between an Arab country and the Jewish state.
   Citing Arafat's December proclamations as evidence, Mubarak said
the Arabs have changed their intransigent positions and are making
proposals for peace. He said they encounter repeated negativism from
Israel, which has refused to deal with the PLO.
   Mubarak noted that there has been discord in the region for four
decades and warned that 40 more years without peace would be
disastrous, especially in light of the ``new weapons of mass
destruction.''
   The only answer, he said, is for Israel to talk peace with the
PLO, repeating a common Egyptian theme.
   ``There's no way, don't bother. You will have to talk to the
PLO,'' the president said.
   ``We can't fool ourselves. The PLO is everywhere. Those at your
end won't stop unless they have some hope in life. Believe me they
won't talk to you alone, and I know what I am saying.''
   He referred to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who
for the last 15 months have had almost daily riots against Israel's
occupying forces. Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The conference was mostly in Arabic. Mubarak, usually
mild-mannered, appeared sometimes angered, sometimes exasperated in
his comments.
   Joking with peace advocate Abie Nathan, who said he would beam
Arabic lessons on a radio station he runs, Mubarak said in English:
``I am giving you a good lesson in the Arabic language to persuade
your people to learn Arabic and cooperate with the Arab people.''
   Then, changing to a more serious tone, he said:
   ``You are living in an Arab world. It's better just to cooperate
with them.''

   A man convicted of torturing and murdering
his sister-in-law and trying to kill his wife should spend the rest
of his life behind bars, said the judge who sentenced him.
   ``You must never be free. You must never be in a position where
this can happen again,'' Circuit Judge Gary Carlson told John R.
Weber as he sentenced him Wednesday to life plus 164 years, nine
months in prison.
   Weber, 25, of Phillips, was charged with 18 counts in the 1986
killing of his wife's sister, Carla Lenz, 17, and the attempted
murder of his 22-year-old wife in September in this northern
Wisconsin town.
   He pleaded guilty to nine charges, including the kidnapping and
first-degree murder of Miss Lenz and the attempted murder of his
wife, but pleaded innocent to charges of sexual assault and
mutilation.
   A jury convicted him of the sexual assault and mutilation charges
and decided Weber was sane at the time of the attacks.
   Weber's attorney has said he will appeal.
   Among the evidence was a tape recording describing the slaying
that Weber said he made to scare his wife but never played for her.
   ``This court must insure that no other unsuspecting female is
ever exposed to your depravity. There is no way that I could face
the family of such a girl,'' the judge said.
   Weber's wife said she was satisfied with the sentence. Weber was
accused of using a lighted cigar, safety pin and wheelbarrow handle
to assault her before beating her with a shovel.

   A group of Cree Indians who are asking the

week to decide whether to give up the cloth bundle holding bear
claws, sweet grass and a clump of tobacco.
   Officials are concerned about Jim Thunder's standing among the
Cree people, his self-proclaimed ``mandate'' to claim the object and
his relationship to Chief Big Bear, who created the relic more than
150 years ago, museum spokesman Herb Kurz said.
   Thunder completed a 2,700-mile run from Edmonton, Alberta, on
Tuesday to voice his claim for the artifact.
   The 38-year-old Cree has said he was inspired by numerous dreams
and visions in which Big Bear directed him to fetch the sacred
bundle, which has been in the museum collection for more than 50
years. Thunder wants to return it to his people for use in
traditional religious ceremonies.
   ``It's our tradition as Cree people to respect and have patience.
The bundle is away for 55 years so I think we can wait for another
few days,'' said Lewis Cardinal, spokesman for the Indians.
   Kurz said a curator in the anthropology department would consider
Thunder's presentation and make a recommendation to museum
officials. He said Thunder had downplayed his role as a political
representative of the Cree and stressed that he had a ``spiritual
mandate'' to return the relic.
   ``To us a political mandate would be, to make it as simple as
possible, numbers of persons who agree that he should be the person
to take it out of the (museum),'' Kurz said.
   Other Cree, whom Kurz would not identify, have told museum
officials Thunder does not represent the majority of their people
and have asked that the museum keep the sacred bundle in its
collection or give it to them, the spokesman said.
   Thunder admits he is not a blood relative of the chief. He was
adopted several years ago by a woman who was Big Bear's
great-granddaughter.
   The sacred bundle, made by Big Bear when he was 13 years old, was
given to a museum anthropologist in 1934 for safekeeping by a son of
Big Bear. Since then, it has been in the museum's research
department but has never been on public display.

   Critics of ``shock jock'' Perry Stone
were pleased that KSJO-FM decided to fire the controversial disc
jockey they had accused of using racial and sexist slurs in his
popular morning talk show.
   Stone was fired Tuesday after separate incidents during his March
10 show in which he insulted an unidentified girl and advised two
9-year-old Brownies to steal Girl Scout cookie money, station
officials said.
   ``Perry Stone has been occupying a lot of my life lately, and I'm
very glad to have it gone,'' said Marjorie Boehm, leader of a group
that had filed a complaint against Stone with the Federal
Communications Commission.
   Kelly Poritz, who stood up to Stone when he suggested she and
another 9-year-old Brownie pocket money from cookie sales, said
``Great,'' when she learned of the firing.
   ``He was a jerk. He was ugly,'' Kelly said.
   Stone, 30, was criticized for his slurs against women, minorities
and the disabled during his show at the San Jose station, which
became top-rated among men ages 18 to 34.
   ``I still believe Perry is a very talented guy,'' said General
Manager David Baronfeld. ``But what happened March 10 was something
that placed the station, the company, and the people at the station
at risk that wasn't there before.''
   Another segment that aired the same day exposed the station to a
possible lawsuit when Stone insulted another girl on the air, said
Baronfeld.
   Station attorney Michael Hurley on Tuesday would not reveal the
girl's name and said he had no tape or transcript.
   Stone recorded a retraction Friday that will be broadcast four
times during the next four weeks, the last time Stone will be heard
on KSJO, Hurley said.
   Stone, who was informed of the decision on Tuesday evening, could
not be reached for comment. A man answering an Associated Press call
to the station declined to comment or to contact Stone, who is not
listed in the telephone listings for the San Jose area.

   More than 120 people have been killed
this week in an upsurge of political violence by Sinhalese
extremists trying to topple the Sinhalese-dominated government,
authorities said.
   The government of President Ranasinghe Premadasa has vowed to
deal harshly with the rebels, who it blames for the rise in murders
on this strife-torn Indian Ocean island.
   ``We have to get rid of subversives one day or another. The
sooner the better,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told a
news conference late Wednesday.
   Wijeratne said at least 60 people were killed in northern
Anuradhapura province on Tuesday, a Buddhist holiday.
   Officials said at least 53 people were killed Sunday and Monday,
and nine were killed Wednesday as the extremists crippled the island
with a daylong strike by threatening violence against anyone trying
to do business.
   Most of the victims have been members of the governing United
National Party or policemen, Wijeratne said.
   ``The laws will be ameded to strengthen the hand of the security
forces against the subversives,'' he said late Wendesday. ``We are
now working without emergency laws, subversives cannot be controlled
by ordinary laws.''
   Subversives is the official term for members of the extremist
People's Liberation Front, which contends the government has offered
too many concessions to the minority Tamils, who have been fighting
for a separate homeland in the north and east since 1983.
   Wijeratne said the Sinhalese extremists were killing security
personnel and government suppoers because they were ``desperate''
following military and police operations.
   ``The pressure is on them and we are closing in,'' he said.
   Premadasa, elected to a six-year term on Dec. 19, took office on
Jan. 2. The newly elected members of Parliament, controlled by the
United National Party, were convened on March 9.
   The front claims the elections were fraudulent.
   Tamils are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people. They say they are denied jobs and education by
the majority Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population
and control the government and military.
   The government signed an accord in July 1987 aimed at ending the
insurgency by offering the Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for
surrender of weapons. But many Tamil militants rejected the accord
as insufficient.

<HEAD>Mubarak To Israel: `You are Living In Illusion ... Say Yes To Peace'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: To CORRECT that Weizman the only Israeli Cabinet minister
in Egypt for conference, SUB 5th graf, `Ezer Weizman ... East peace.' Picks

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak told visiting Israeli
journalists that by always rejecting Arab overtures for peace, their
government is acting as the Arabs did for 40 years.
   ``You are still living in illusion. Everything has changed,''
Mubarak said, sitting surrounded by Israelis in a sunlit garden of a
presidential palace. ``We used to live in illusion before but got no
result.
   ``The Arabs from 1947 until recently have been saying no to every
Israeli suggestion. Now I find you have become like the Arabs of
old: We are saying yes, you are saying no.''
   In December, the Palestine Liberation Organization through its
chairman, Yasser Arafat, renounced terror as a weapon in its fight
for a homeland and recognized for the first time that Israel too has
a right to exist in the Middle East.
   Ezer Weizman, Israel's dovish minister of science and research,
sat next to Mubarak during Wednesday's news conference. Weizman, who
had just held talks with Mubarak, was among several Israelis in
Cairo since Sunday for a seminar on Middle East peace.
   The session occurred days before the 10th anniversary on Sunday
of Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, still the only peace accord
between an Arab country and the Jewish state.
   Citing Arafat's December proclamations as evidence, Mubarak said
the Arabs have changed their intransigent positions and are making
proposals for peace. He said they encounter repeated negativism from
Israel, which has refused to deal with the PLO.
   Mubarak noted that there has been discord in the region for four
decades and warned that 40 more years without peace would be
disastrous, especially in light of the ``new weapons of mass
destruction.''
   The only answer, he said, is for Israel to talk peace with the
PLO, repeating a common Egyptian theme.
   ``There's no way, don't bother. You will have to talk to the
PLO,'' the president said.
   ``We can't fool ourselves. The PLO is everywhere. Those at your
end won't stop unless they have some hope in life. Believe me they
won't talk to you alone, and I know what I am saying.''
   He referred to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who
for the last 15 months have had almost daily riots against Israel's
occupying forces. Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The conference was mostly in Arabic. Mubarak, usually
mild-mannered, appeared sometimes angered, sometimes exasperated in
his comments.
   Joking with peace advocate Abie Nathan, who said he would beam
Arabic lessons on a radio station he runs, Mubarak said in English:
``I am giving you a good lesson in the Arabic language to persuade
your people to learn Arabic and cooperate with the Arab people.''
   Then, changing to a more serious tone, he said:
   ``You are living in an Arab world. It's better just to cooperate
with them.''

<TEXT>
   The district attorney has shut down the
Third Annual Cajun Cup professional poker tournament, forcing 1,400
players to fold.
   Ken Pyle, who started the tournament, blamed religious protests
for the abrupt end to the 12-day event that was to have run through
the weekend.
   A Baptist group was picketing the hotel when District Attorney
Nathan Stansbury called organizers aside Wednesday, told them the
event violated gambling laws and ordered it stopped, said Pyle. No
arrests were made.
   ``They (the protesters) had sent nasty letters about the
tournament to the police chief, the sheriff, and the governor,'' he
said.
   The district attorney allowed the tournament in previous years on
grounds that, as a private event, it did not violate gambling laws.
   ``We have always told them to warn us before if they have a
problem, and we would find another city,'' Pyle said. ``They always
said, `No problem.'''
   Stansbury has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached this morning.
   Pyle and world champion poker player Eldon Elias started the
Cajun Cup two years ago.
   ``We treated this as another convention in our community,'' said
Gerald Breaux, director of the Lafayette Convention and Visitors
Commission.
   He said the average tourist spends $140 a day, so 1,400 players
would have spent $2.3 million in 12 days. ``Moral issue or non-moral
issue, it's an economic issue,'' Breaux said. ``It was good for
Lafayette.''

<HEAD>Syrian Gunners Join Artillery Bombardment In Lebanon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with witnesses saying Syrian gunners
firing into Christian-held areas. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syrian forces today helped Moslem militias
launch artillery and rocket attacks on Christian regions, witnesses
said. Police said nine people were killed and 26 wounded in the
fighting.
   Police said more than 5,000 shells and rockets hit the capital,
the Christian-dominated region to the north and Druse-held territory
to the southeast during nine hours of bombardments by the Christian
army, the Syrians and Syrian-backed militiamen. The Christian
enclave was hit with 40 rockets a minute before the firing subsided
at 3 a.m.
   The new casualties raised the toll to 75 people killed and 237
wounded since March 8, when the latest fighting broke out between
Christian troops of Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian-backed fighters of
Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt.
   A statement by Aoun's command accused Syrian troops of
involvement in the bombardment of the 310-square-mile Christian
heartland, where 1 million Christians are trapped in a
crescent-shaped enclave.
   Residents in Aramoun, seven miles southeast of Beirut, said they
saw the Syrian army firing from several positions near the village.
The witnesses, insisting on anonymity, said the Syrians suffered an
unspecified number of casualties in shelling from Aoun's forces.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said all
foreign forces except U.N. peacekeepers should leave Lebanon.
   Asked if that included the withdrawal of Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon with 40,000 troops, Redman said: ``That would be
all those non-Lebanese armed elements and organizations currently on
Lebanese soil, with the exception of (the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon), whose mandate ... is renewed every six months at the
specific request of Lebanon.''
   Amid the violence, Aoun said: ``Let (Syrian) President Hafez
Assad relinquish power. That will be better for Lebanon, Syria and
the Middle East.''
   Aoun, 53, heads the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government. He was responding to editorials by Syria's official
media that called for his ouster as a condition to curbing the
violence in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Minutes after Aoun's statement was broadcast by Christian radio
and television his command at the Defense Ministry in suburban Yarze
was shelled, the police spokesman said.
   The thuds of exploding shells shook Beirut and the surrounding
wooded hills. Trails of light behind missiles lit up the skies as
residents huddled in basements and bomb shelters.
   ``Don't forget to turn off butane cylinders before heading to
shelters. Do not use lifts. Keep windows open to avoid shards from
shattered glass in case of explosions,'' Voice of Lebanon, the main
radio station in Christian east Beirut, warned listeners.
   The latest violence broke out two days after Aoun blockaded
militia-run ports to reactivate tax collection at five government
harbors on Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean coast. Syria's militia
allies rejected the move.
   The latest crisis began Sept. 22 when parliament could not meet
to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel. Gemayel appointed
Aoun head of an interim military cabinet. Syrian-backed Moslems
rejected the appointment.

   A former Philippine Cabinet minister who arrived
to pay a bedside visit to Ferdinand Marcos was arrested as a
material witness in the $100 million racketeering case against the
deposed Philippine president.
   Former Education Secretary Jaime Laya was freed on $100,000 bail
Wednesday and ordered to appear May 8 in federal court in New York.
A federal magistrate forced him to surrender his passport, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Peyton.
   Laya, who arrived here Wednesday, was arrested by FBI and Customs
agents on a material witness warrant, FBI spokesman Harlan Frymire
said.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said Laya and several other
former members of Marcos' Cabinet were to visit the former
president's hospital room today.
   Marcos had made Laya education minister after Laya was forced to
resign as Central Bank governor in 1984 because of an overstatement
of $600 million in the country's foreign exchange reserves.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Peyton said Laya had refused to be
interviewed by U.S. prosecutors before his arrest.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are under federal indictment on
charges of plundering their homeland of more than $100 million to
buy choice New York real estate and expensive art.
   Marcos' health has prevented him from being arraigned. The
71-year-old former president remained in guarded condition at St.
Francis Medical Center, where he has been since Jan. 15 for
treatment of heart and lung problems.
   Former Justice Minister Estelito Mendoza, speaking for the group
of former Cabinet members as they left Manila to visit Marcos,
denied Philippine news reports that they intend to challenge the
authority of Philippine President Corazon Aquino or escort Marcos
back home.
   ``This is a private visit,'' Mendoza said. ``In keeping with the
established Filipino tradition, we are visiting an ailing person.
There will be no Cabinet meeting in exile as earlier reported.''
   Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return home, despite
repeated pleas from Marcos' family that he wants to die in his
homeland.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Urges Foreign Policy Debates In Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze says a new
parliament now being formed should debate foreign policy issues in
order to prevent the kind of closed-door decision making that sent
Soviet troops into Afghanistan.
   In an interview published Wednesday by the government newspaper
Izvestiya, Shevardnadze said, ``I foresee the time when open debates
on some or other international problems will become natural
practice.''
   ``High officials of the Foreign Ministry, the minister included,
will be giving answers to informal questions from deputies, when
referendums and public opinion polls will be held before taking
fundamental decisions,'' he said.
   The Soviet policy of glasnost, or greater openness on some
issues, has affected mainly internal issues. Dissent on questions of
foreign policy has only recently surfaced in the media.
   The Congress of People's Deputies is being formed now. It will
consist of 750 representatives of the Communist Party, its
affiliates, professsional and social organizations, and 1,500
members elected from geographical districts.
   Voting for geographical districts will take place Sunday, but the
organizations are electing their deputies now. The congress will
then choose from among its members a new Supreme Soviet parliament.
   Shevardnadze said the new parliament, by serving as a forum for
foreign policy debates, could bring about ``new forms of glasnost in
foreign policy and diplomacy,'' Shevardnadze said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who launched the current
reorganization, also says the new legislature must take a greater
role in setting policy.
   Under the Soviet Constitution, any decision to use armed forces
abroad must be sanctioned by the Supreme Soviet, Shevardnadze said.
   Top Soviet officials have criticized the process that led to the
Afghanistan intervention in 1979, saying a narrow group of people
made the decision without consulting anyone.
   The Soviet Union pulled its remaining troops out of Afghanistan
last month after nine years of war and an estimated 15,000 dead.

<TEXT>
   Police today searched for dangerous
detonators that were strewn across an area when a truck carrying
explosives blew up, and the government announced new rules for the
transport of explosives.
   A firefighter was killed and more than 80 people were injured, 11
seriously, after the truck caught fire and blew up Wednesday at an
industrial park in Peterborough, 75 miles north of London.
   Transport Minister Peter Bottomley said the changes in government
regulations, which had been planned before the blast, will require
vehicles to advertise that they carry explosives.
   Bottomley told the House of Commons that the new rules, expected
to take effect in July, will require placards to be displayed on
vehicles and better training of drivers.
   ``We must learn the lessons both on how to make existing
regulations work and on how to make sure regulations can be modified
at least to maintain safety,'' he said.
   Bottomley said the death of fireighter John Humphries was the
first in an accident involving the transport of explosives since
1957.
   Police said about 10 percent of the more than 750 detonators in
the truck at the time of the blast had been found by late morning,
some on the roofs of neighboring buildings. Police sealed off the
area and were using sniffer dogs to track down the copper cyanide
detonators, which they said will explode if dropped or struck hard.
   ``The experts are there to search the area and make it safe,''
said Sgt. Tom Stevens of the Cambridgeshire Police, speaking of the
bomb experts, police, fire and transport officials at the scene.
   The tanker truck had been carrying explosives and detonators to a
nearby fireworks factory when it caught fire outside in an
industrial park.
   Soon after firefighters arrived, and before the park could be
evacuated, the truck blew up. Witnesses said it was ``torn to
shreds'' and the wreckage was strewn more than 900 feet.
   The Fire Brigade said it was not told the truck was carrying
explosives.
   The truck had a small label in the back saying it carried
explosives, said Dick Robson, a spokesman for ICI, the company that
owned the truck.
   Robson said the cause of the explosion was under investigation by
the company and government officials.

   Milton Frome, a comic actor who appeared in
more than 50 movies and was Milton Berle's straight man during
television's golden age, has died at age 78.
   Frome died of heart failure Tuesday at the Motion Picture and
Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, said his son, Michael Frome.
   The actor appeared opposite such stars as Buddy Ebsen, Mickey
Rooney and Ann Miller in a career that spanned vaudeville to
television.
   He was a regular on Berle's show during the 1950s and played an
autocratic studio boss on ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' from 1964 to
1967.
   His film credits include ``Ride 'em Cowboy!,'' ``Bye Bye
Birdie,'' ``With Six You Get Egg Roll,'' ``Batman'' and ``The Nutty
Professor.'' The latter film starred funnyman Jerry Lewis, with whom
Frome appeared in 16 movies.
   He also appeared in such stage productions as ``Follow the

with Rooney and Miss Miller in ``Sugar Babies.''
   Frome is also survived by his wife, Marjorie, and a brother.

<HEAD>Japanese Opposition Party Demands Resignation Of Takeshita, Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Clean Government Party today joined other
opposition groups in demanding the prime minister and his Cabinet
resign, saying a stock scandal has stripped the government of its
mandate to rule.
   Junya Yano, chairman of the second-largest opposition party, told
reporters that public distrust in the government ``has reached a
critical level'' because of the so-called Recruit stock scandal
involving Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and a number of prominent
figures in the governing circle.
   An unpopular 3-percent sales tax, effective April 1, will further
erode public confidence in government, Yano said.
   ``The Cabinet should immediately resign to let opposition parties
form an interim government for the management of new, general
elections,'' Yano told a news conference at the Japan National Press
Club.
   Yano was referring to the Recruit scandal, in which the
information conglomerate Recruit Co. offered hundreds of thousands
of unlisted shares in its real estate subsidiary to more than 150
people, including politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.
   Takeshita's secretary was implicated, as was former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's secretary, in the scandal in which many
recipients of the stock sold the shares for handsome profits.
   The scandal, rocking the Japanese establishment since the summer,
has seen the arrest of 13 people and the resignation of three
Cabinet ministers.
   All opposition groups but the Clean Government Party had been
demanding that the Cabinet resign and the powerful lower house of
Parliament be dissolved to clarify the responsibility of the
government.
   Yano explained that his party had waited for Takeshita to make an
honorable retreat by dissolving the Cabinet on his own initiative.
``But, we have come to a conclusion that Mr. Takeshita has an
illusion that he can survive the crisis.... Now we'll fight to
topple his government.''
   The Clean Government Party, backed by the huge Buddhist
organization Soka Gakkai, has 200,000 members nationwide and holds
79 seats in the two houses of Japan's Parliament, making it the
second-strongest opposition force after the Japan Socialist Party,
which has 128 seats.

   A 10-year-old convicted of selling crack
has been sentenced to 18 months at a home for troubled youngsters,
where care-givers say his behavior is improving and he is ``thrilled
he can finally read.''
   Family Court Judge Donald Auperin on Wednesday sent the boy to
the Little Flower Children's Services home in Wading River, 30 miles
from his home on Long Island.
   The boy was arrested Jan. 14 as he and a 14-year-old tried to
flee a drug raid in Wyandanch. Police said he dropped a bag
containing three $20 vials of crack. Police also found $226 on the
boys.
   Auperin found the child delinquent. The 14-year-old's case is
being handled separately.
   The judge agreed to open the proceedings against the 10-year-old
because of public interest in the case but asked that the boy's name
be withheld because of his age.
   The child was held in a children's shelter after his arrest and
was moved to Little Flower on Feb. 27.
   Adrienne Carr, a spokeswoman for the home, said the boy is doing
well in school. ``He's so thrilled he can finally read,'' she said.
   Probation officers had recommended the maximum of 18 months at a
juvenile detention facility north of New York City.
   After the judge's ruling, the child turned to his mother and
said, ``I bet you're happy they're not sending me upstate.''

<HEAD>China Won't Allow More Political Parties</HEAD>

   Chinese officials today ruled out the formation of
new political parties and said the eight parties that operate under
communist control will contine to be closely regulated.
   Leaders of China's eight so-called democratic parties also said
they expected more government officials to be appointed from their
ranks.
   On Tuesday, Communist Party authorities announced a plan to allow
the eight parties to participate in China's government.
   Yan Mingfu, who heads the Communist Party's office that deals
with other parties, said the plan will be ready by June or July.
   Cooperation among the eight parties, he said, will occur only
under the leadership of the Communist Party, which has ruled China
since 1949.
   The plan comes as a growing number of intellectuals are calling
for more political freedom and appears to be an attempt by the
Communist Party to silence critics without relinquishing power.
   Today's announcement, which came at a news conference on
multiparty cooperation, further emphasized this point. The news
conference was held by the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, a prestigious but powerless advisory body currently
meeting in Beijing.
   ``The Communist Party of China and the eight democratic parties
share the same goals. We are in the same boat,'' said Wan Guoquan,
vice chairman of the China Democratic National Committee. ``Just
like a symphony, a country needs a conductor. The Communist Party is
our conductor.''
   Zhao Weizhi, secretary general of the Jiusan Society, said China
would not allow new parties to form.
   ``The eight democratic parties already represent a wide part of
society,'' he said. ``So no new parties are needed.''

<HEAD>One Palestinian Killed, 11 Wounded in Clashes</HEAD>

   Soldiers shot and killed a 14-year-old
Palestinian during a confrontation with stone-throwing youths in a
West Bank village today, and 10 Palestinians were wounded in the
occupied territories, Arab doctors said.
   The army confirmed three Palestinians were wounded and said it
was checking the other reported casualties.
   An Israeli newspaper, meanwhile, reported that Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres has proposed a peace plan that calls for a
demilitarized Palestinian state with its own parliament.
   An aide to Peres, who is finance minister, denied the report.
``There is no Palestinian state in that plan,'' said Peres spokesman
Avi Gil.
   But Labor Party legislator Avrum Burg confirmed the broad
outlines of the report in the daily Haaretz, which said the plan
included a one-year truce between Israel and the Palestinians.
``That's the general direction, but it's very embryonic,'' said
Burg, who declined to comment further.
   Peres has said he would only launch a personal peace initiative
if the plan to be presented by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in
Washington next month fails to advance the peace process.
   Shamir has said his own peace plan to be presented in Washington
will not include any territorial compromise.
   A Palestinian youth, Maher Shakid Said, 14, died today after
Israeli soldiers shot him in the chest during a clash in the village
of Ousarin, south of Nablus, doctors at Al Ittihad Hospital said.
   Residents said the confrontation broke out after the army raided
the village and a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was wounded in the
right hand.
   The death raised to 405 the number of Palestinians killed since
the start of the 15-month revolt against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Seventeen Israelis have also died.
   Fights with Israeli soldiers also broke out in a number of other
West Bank locations and seven Palestinians were wounded, Arab
reports said.
   Two Palestinians were also reported wounded in the Gaza Strip
town of Khan Yunis, including a 14-year-old shot in the left foot.
   In Gaza City, the body of a 3-month-old Palestinian girl was
brought to Shifa Hospital, and her parents told hospital officials
she died after inhaling tear gas. Shifa doctors, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the girl, Shirin Mohammed Moustafa
Sheikh, smelled of tear gas when she was brought in Wednesday night
but that only an autopsy could determine cause of death.
   Army officials said they were checking the report. Arab reports
said soliders fired tear gas at Palestinian protesters in Seitoun
Wednesday night.
   Israeli media, meanwhile, reported today that U.S. officials have
threatened to reduce U.S. aid to Israel if the Jewish state
continues to build settlements in the occupied territories.
   U.S. officials reportedly issued the warning during a visit by
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in Washington last week.
   Officials at the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Embassy in
Tel Aviv refused comment. Washington views the 130 Jewish
settlements in occupied territories as an obstacle to peace.

<TEXT>
   A man who claimed Israeli agents killed his
bride during a honeymoon cruise and framed him for the crime has
been convicted of throwing her overboard to her death.
   A federal jury Wednesday found Scott Robin Roston guilty of
murder after three days of deliberation.
   The prosecution said Roston, 36, of Santa Monica, had argued with
Karen Waltz Roston, 26, and choked her and tossed her over the
railing as the ship headed toward Southern California in 1988 at the
end of a three-day cruise to Mexico.
   Roston's defense was that Israeli agents on board drugged him and
killed his wife for writing the book ``Nightmare in Israel,'' in
which he claimed he was brutalized in an Israeli mental hospital
after his arrest on a robbery charge.
   ``The defense was absurd. His claim was absurd,'' U.S. Attorney
Robert C. Bonner said at a news conference.
   The defense called no witnesses. The prosecution offered
testimony from one of two Israelis, a Jerusalem photographer, who
had been aboard the ship. The man denied he was a government agent.
   ``He's disappointed,'' defense attorney David Kenner said of
Roston. ``Scott feels that it's incomprehensible for anyone to
believe that he would have killed his wife that he loved very
dearly.''
   Kenner said he will appeal on the ground that U.S. courts lacked
jurisdiction because the ship was registered in the Bahamas and the
crime took place on the high seas.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kendra McNally said the ship was partly
owned by Americans, conferring jurisdiction here.
   Federal guidelines call for 11 to 14 years in prison, but the
judge could sentence Roston to up to life. Sentencing was set for
June 5.
   Jury forewoman Theresa Mattaddocon said jurors immediately
rejected the claim about Israeli agents.
   ``Why on a honeymoon cruise would a man take his bride's life?
That bothered all of us,'' said another juror, Patricia Kellogg.
``We couldn't get into his mind. We could only surmise it was a fit
of anger.''
   Mrs. Roston's body was found 30 miles off San Diego. An autopsy
revealed she died of strangulation associated with drowning.

<TEXT>
   The government today said it began
arming police with about 13,000 M-16 rifles to defend their posts
against attacks by radical protesters, a move critics said can only
incite more violence.
   Police ordered about 5,000 investigators to remain on indefinite
alert and to arrest leftists, said the Seoul newspaper Chosun Ilbo.
   Riots broke out after the tough measures were announced.
Authorities said about 3,400 students, hurling firebombs and rocks,
battled riot police today outside campuses in four cities.
   President Roh Tae-woo on Wednesday ordered security forces to
crack down on radicals and dissidents, calling them a major threat
to political stability.
   ``All government offices must cooperate to root out the violent
and destructive acts of leftists attempting to overthrow the
government,'' a presidential spokesman quoted Roh as telling
security officials.
   The government said it was allowing police to carry guns and use
them in self-defense in response to mounting firebomb attacks on
police stations.
   The country's police have until now rarely carried guns, normally
using only tear gas and shields to defend themselves.
   Senior government officials, who declined to be further
identified, said U.S.-built semi-automatic M-16s were issued today
to police.
   Opposition parties charged that the move only would aggravate
unrest. Issuing M-16s was ``tantamont to declaring a war against the
people,'' the Reunification Democratic Party said in a statement.
   On Monday, Roh announced that he was postponing indefinitely a
national referendum on his performance that he had promised before
his election.
   He blamed the postponement on threats from radical groups and
discord over how to hold the referendum.
   But there were indications Roh might have difficulty winning a
victory in the referendum and could be pressured into calling new
elections. Many South Koreans are critical of the government for
failing to sever links with Roh's authoritarian predecessor, former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Radicals have staged numerous violent anti-government protests,
but they have little support and are not seen as a threat to
government stability. Roh reportedly is under pressure from
government hardliners to end the protests.
   Prosecutor-General Kim Gi-chun followed Roh's directive by
issuing orders today for a nationwide crackdown on all pro-North
Korean activities.
   He ordered the seizure of pro-North Korean publications, the
closure of private institutes used by radical groups to spread
communist ideology and the arrest of people using firebombs to
attack government facilities.
   Many radicals have leftist leanings but deny supporting North
Korea.
   The three main opposition parties, which control the National
Assembly, agreed today to call a parliamentary hearing on the
firearms order.
   The largest opposition party, the Party for Peace and Democracy,
said in a statement today: ``We strongly oppose the use of firearms.
The only way to restore social and political stability is to
continue democratic reforms.''
   The largest dissident group, the United National Democratic
Movement, called on the government to withdraw the decision, calling
it ``an open threat to democratic forces.''
   Thousands of students staged violent protests around campuses
today in Seoul and three other cities. In Seoul, riot police stopped
about 800 students who tried to march out of Sejong University to
demand Roh' ouster.
   In Suwon, about 700 students armed with hundreds of firebombs
battled riot police for three hours, denouncing Roh's order,
according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. At least five
students and three police were injured, Yonhap said.
   Yonhap also reported violent anti-government protests in Taejon
and Kwangju where about 2,200 students hurled about 1,200 firebombs
at riot police, who responded with barrages of tear gas.

<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said today he is
convinced the Bush administration favors in principle convening an
international Middle East peace conference.
   His comments came one day after U.S. and PLO representatives
talked for 4{ hours in their first formal meeting since Bush took
office.
   The United States talked about reducing tension in the
Israeli-occupied lands, but the PLO vowed the Palestinian uprising
will not let up until Israel withdraws from the territories.
   Arafat told reporters today that the Palestine Liberation
Organization believes the only solution to the Middle East crisis is
an international conference involving all of the parties, including
the PLO, Israel and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council.
   ``As for the American administration, they are for an
international conference in principle but say it should be very well
prepared,'' the PLO chairman asserted.
   Israel opposes the idea of an international conference, as it
does the American decision to talk with the PLO. The Reagan
administration, while not enthusiastic about an international
conference, said such a conference could be helpful if it led to
direct Arab-Israeli talks.
   Arafat, speaking to reporters in a PLO office, said a leadership
meeting was held Wednesday night.
   ``Our evaluation, one, is that we consider that the content of
the meeting was a positive one and, second, it was a serious one in
so far as the topics on the agenda were concerned,'' said Arafat,
wearing his traditional Arab headdress and green military uniform.
   ``We consider the meeting an indication of the new American
administration is seriously interested in this PLO-American
dialogue.''
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis refused to discuss the
meeting and referred all queries or requests for comment to the U.S.
State Department.
   Arafat said it was Israel's responsibility to ease tension in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 400 Palestinians and 17
Israelis have died in the 15-month-old uprising.
   ``I understand that a request for reducing tension is directed at
Israel because it is Israel that is causing the tension _ not only
the army, but settler groups using arms against Palestinians,''
Arafat said.
   A first contact between the United States and the PLO occurred
Dec. 16, shortly after Washington reversed a 13-year policy of
refusing to deal with the PLO. That decision followed Arafat's
public renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel's right
to exist.
   Wednesday's session was the first to get down to the substantive
issues of peace and conflict in the Middle East, terrorism,
negotiations and who represents the Palestinian people, delegates
from both sides said.
   Israel rejects the PLO as a terrorist organization.
   Asked by reporters if the United States demanded the PLO put an
end to the uprising, Arafat said, ``No such request was presented by
anyone, and no one can ask us to do that. No one can stop a people
from resisting occupation.''
   No date for a further session was announced, but both American
and PLO officials said they fully expected the talks to continue.
   ``The issues won't be finished in one meeting, even two,'' said
the chief PLO delegate, Yasser Abed-Rabbo.
   The leading U.S. delegate, Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau, said
he ``focused on practical steps which can be taken to reduce
tensions in the occupied territories and lead to direct
negotiations.''
   Abed-Rabbo said he stressed to the Americans that the source of
the violence in the territories was ``the Israeli occupation and the
Israeli repressive measures.'' He said: ``The (uprising) will
continue until the Israelis evacuate our homeland.''
   Neither side was precise about what proposals may have been made
with regard to the territories or specific areas discussed.

   The City Council approved mandatory drug tests for
city employees but did not extend the policy to itself, even after
one member said he had abused ``just about everything.''
   Instead, the council on Wednesday approved a measure asking
members to take voluntary drug tests.
   ``I have smoked, snorted, sneezed, drank _ just about
everything,'' said Councilman Al Lipscomb, 64. ``I have abused
drugs, alcohol, et al. Let's show some leadership and be the first
to take the test.''
   But after an hour's debate, his amendment proposing that council
members be tested for drugs before city employees was defeated 8-3.
   Lipscomb, an independent councilman known for his outspokenness,
said today that he used drugs in the 1940s and the 1950s but quit
when ``I found the Lord.''
   ``I took drugs in the days I was sowing my oats,'' he said. ``We
called it reefer back then. I haven't been 64 always.''
   The drug policy for city employees takes effect Oct. 1 and
stipulates that all people applying for ``safety sensitive''
positions _ such as driver, mechanic and maintenance worker _ must
take drug and alcohol tests to be hired. About two-thirds of city
jobs fall under the policy.
   In addition, an employee would be asked to take drug or alcohol
tests if two supervisors determined there was ``reasonable
suspicion'' that the employee was using drugs or alcohol.
   An employee who refused testing could face disciplinary action.
   City Attorney Analeslie Muncy said she did not think Lipscomb's
proposed amendment would have withstood a legal challenge because
council members are not in ``safety sensitive'' positions and
because the test would be required without ``reasonable suspicion.''
   On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld drug testing for
railway workers involved in accidents, and, by a narrower margin,
for Customs Service workers seeking assignments as drug enforcement
agents or in jobs requiring them to carry firearms. Experts were
divided on whether the rulings mean the justices would be likely to
accept drug testing for many other types of workers.
   Nancy Burkett, business manager for the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, argued against the city drug
policy and said the council was yielding to ``hysteria sweeping out
of Washington.''
   ``There is no evidence that a drug problem exists among city
employees,'' said Ms. Burkett, whose organization represents 400 of
Dallas' 13,000 city workers.

   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down the
city's equal division of political power among five boroughs with
huge population differences prompted an immediate threat of
secession from Staten Island.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch responded that he would protect the
interests of Staten Island, the least populous borough.
   The Board of Estimate, a body unique to New York City, is ``a
substantial departure from the one-person, one-vote ideal,'' Justice
Byron R. White wrote in the unanimous ruling striking down the
city's form of government Wednesday.
   The justices upheld a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling requiring a
plan that meets that standard. Currently, Staten Island, with fewer
than 400,000 residents, has the same voting power on the board as
Brooklyn, with 2.2 million.
   The board governs everything from land-use decisions to setting
sewer and water rates, negotiating city contracts and awarding
franchises and leasing property. It also has partial authority for
the city's $25 billion budget.
   Its powers are greater than those of City Council, a lawmaking
body whose 35 representatives are elected from proportional
districts citywide.
   The board is made up of the five borough presidents, each with
one vote, and three citywide elected officials _ the mayor,
comptroller and City Council president _ each with two votes.
   It was created in 1898 when the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan,
Queens and Staten Island joined to form New York City.
   White said the under-representation on the board for the city's
largest boroughs is severe, and he rejected arguments that the
make-up legitimately balances regional interests.
   He said a voter is shortchanged ``if he may vote for one
representative and the voters in another district half the size also
elect one representative.''
   The ruling left city government in disarray before November's
elections, in which all eight positions on the board will be
decided. It also renewed calls from the smallest borough that it
leave the city.
   Staten Island ``would be better off back under the rule of George
III,'' said state Sen. John Marchi, who is sponsoring a bill in
Albany to have his borough leave New York City.
   The ruling ``drops 400,000 Staten Islanders into a colonial state
by effectively separating them from the governance of the larger
community in which we live,'' said Marchi.
   The borough's president, Ralph Lamberti, said: ``I will not stand
up as a representative of 400,000 people and lead them in a colony
state.''
   But he added that if a new voting system reduces Staten Island's
participation in government to that of a ``spectator,'' he would
give serious consideration to seceding.
   The mayor said he's concerned about the problem, adding: ``We'll
find a way to protect Staten Island. I'll protect it.''
   After the lower court ruling, Koch appointed a Charter Revision
Commission, which he said would now move ``full speed ahead'' with a
new governing plan in time for a November referendum.
   Koch said he expects the high court will allow the board to
function until a substitute can be authorized. He also said that
while he favored continuing the board, ``I never believed we could
win it'' in court.
   The city population is more than 7 million, with wide disparities
in the size of the boroughs. Besides Brooklyn's 2.2 million people,
Queens has 1.9 million, Manhattan 1.4 million and the Bronx 1.2
million.
   The presidents of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan called for the
board to be revised by weighting voting according to population. But
Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer opposed weighted voting and
instead urged a county executive form of government in each borough,
removing some power from City Hall.
   City Council President Andrew Stein said he wasn't sure if the
board should change to weighted voting, but added that he was
confident his own office ``will have a strong role in the new
setup.''
   Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who is expected to run against
Koch for mayor, said an alternative government should make it
``impossible for a centralized administration to run roughshod over
communities which, until now, have had direct input into decisions
affecting them.''

   Pope John Paul II led 1,200 clergymen in

Basilica.
   Twenty-four cardinals, 50 bishops and 1,200 priests, all in white
and gold vestments, took part in the service before an audience of
10,000 people.
   ``Let us celebrate together the Eucharist morning of Holy
Thursday,'' John Paul said in his homily in Italian. ``We wish to
renew this gift which each of us received. ... Let us today renew
our priestly vows.''
   The pope also blessed the holy oils used at baptisms,
confirmations and the consecrations of bishops.
   Later in the day, he was going to Rome's Basilica of St. John
Lateran to wash the feet of 12 priests in a service re-enacting
Jesus Christ's Last Supper with his apostles.
   The pope is to carry a wooden cross in a Good Friday procession
near the Colosseum. He will celebrate Easter vigil Saturday night
and an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday.

<HEAD>Breakthrough Claimed in Nuclear Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two scientists claim to have carried controlled
nuclear fusion in a test tube, using a ``ridiculously simple''
technique that could transform the world's energy resources, it was
reported today.
   ``If their discovery is confirmed, they will have gone a long way
toward taming the forces powering the sun and the hydrogen bomb,''
The Financial Times said. ``These could provide virtually unlimited,
clean and inexpensive energy.''
   The paper identified the scientists as Martin Fleischmann of
Southampton University in England and Stan Pons of the University of
Utah. A formal announcement will be made in Salt Lake City later
today.
   Nuclear fusion is regarded as science's next great frontier in
developing new sources of energy, but has generally been considered
to be years away from commercial exploitation. It differs from
conventional processes in that it fuses atoms, rather than splits
them.
   The Financial Times said the two scientists ``have apparently
done in a simple laboratory what has not been achieved by gigantic
projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars a year.''
   The Fleischmann-Pons experiments technically ``are no more
complex than the practical work done by chemistry undergraduates.
They use electrochemical techniques to achieve fusion of deuterium
nuclei trapped inside an electrode made from palladium, a metal
similar to platinum,'' The Financial Times said.
   Dr. Mick Lomer, head of the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority's fusion
laboratory, told the newspaper: ``We're approaching it with a
skeptical but open mind. We shall be doing our utmost to reproduce
the experiment.''
   Fusion produces little radioactive waste; its material,
deuterium, is abundant in seawater; and fusion reactors are expected
to be safer than fission reactors because the fusion process would
shut down if anything went wrong. One past problem has been safely
containing the reaction.
   The newspaper quoted Fleischmann as saying: ``What we have done
is open the door to a new area of research. Our indications are that
the discovery will be reasonably easy to make into a usable
technology for generating heat and power, but a lot more work is
needed to prove its validity further and then to develop practical
generating devices.''
   He was quoted as saying: ``The nature of the experiment is
ridiculously simple, yet in a way so far-fetched, that we decided
not to raise money from external sources but to finance the early
work ourselves.''
   The paper said physicists ``find it hard to believe the deuterium
nuclei could be squeezed together enough for fusion to occur.''
   In a separate report, The Financial Times said the discovery
could ``transform the outlook for the world's energy supplies in the
next century.''
   It said the idea for the experiment originated in the 1960s, and
Pons and Fleischmann began discussing possible test methods while
working together at Southhampton and then at Salt Lake City.
   ``Stan and I often talk of doing insane experiments,'' said
Fleischmann, 61. ``We each have a good track record of getting
impossible experiments to work. In this case, the stakes were so
high that we just had to try out the idea.''

<HEAD>Court Allows Adult Bookstore to Stay Open</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois' highest court has barred
authorities from closing down an adult bookstore under the state's
public nuisance law.
   The Illinois Supreme Court ruled 4-2 on Wednesday that the law
could not be used against the Denmark II Bookstore near Aurora
because it might prevent the sale of non-obscene books and magazines
protected by the First Amendment.
   State's Attorney Dallas Ingemunson, who filed 44 criminal
obscenity cases against the bookstore from 1982 to 1986, expressed
disappointment at the ruling, which he said would be appealed to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Because of obscenity violations, a lower-court judge had ordered
the store to close or post a $5,000 bond to be forfeited if the sale
of obscene matter resumed.
   The store persisted and was ordered closed in 1987 under a law
that allows a judge to shut down a building for a year if it is
deemed a public nuisance.
   The high court said the order to post bond or close ``smacks of
prior restraint,'' which is unconstitutional. The justices noted
that in a dozen previous trials, some of the magazines sold at the
store were found not to be obscene.
   Justice William Clark said the law takes a ``blunderbuss approach
to the regulation of obscenity'' and that law enforcement officials
had ``far less draconian'' means available, including prosecuting
smut peddlers.
   Justice Ben Miller, in a dissent, said the close-and-bond
provision doesn't restrict free speech because the bookstore can
remain open as long as it sells non-obscene material.

<HEAD>Protesting College Students Lock Administrators Out of Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50 students at Colby-Sawyer College
took over the administration building today to protest the possible
admission of men to the women's school.
   The students blocked entrances and locked out administrators
beginning about 6 a.m., said Gail Thacher, a vice president. She
called the demonstration ``enthusiastic but harmless.''
   The private liberal arts school, which has about 450 students and
has been a women's college since 1928, is considering becoming
coeducational in 1990 to maintain enrollment.
   Thacher said college President Peggy Stock was away today and the
school's provost met with students to hear their demands.
   ``We're concerned about the disruption of classes,'' Thacher
said. ``But the administration feels the students are doing about
what we expected them to do.''
   About 100 students staged a sit-in at the building March 16,
demanding a meeting on the issue and representation on the trustees'
task force considering the idea.

<HEAD>Police Clash With Ethnic Albanian Demonstrators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature in a southern
province today approved constitutional amendments that would reduce
its autonomy, prompting clashes between police and thousands of
ethnic Albanians opposed to the change.
   The Tanjug news agency said the amendments were approved by 176
of the 188 Kosovo province lawmakers. They are designed to give the
country's largest republic of mainly Christian Serbia a greater
degree of control over the affairs of Kosovo, which has a mainly
Moslem ethnic Albanian majority.
   It was not immediately clear why the deputies, about 80 percent
of whom are ethnic Albanian, would vote for the measure. But there
was a report that some deputies may have been intimidated by state
security police.
   The decision prompted demontrations by about 3,000 people in the
town of Urosevac in Kosovo province. Hundreds of club-wielding
police dispersed the protesters, who were chanting slogans against
the changes, Tanjug said.
   Police also stopped about 200 ethnic Albanian women and children
who attempted to march in protest from Urosevac to Pristina,
witnesses said.
   Urosevac is 15 miles north of the provincial capital, Pristina.
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up about 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.8
million inhabitants, have in the past opposed the changes, claiming
they would restrict wide autonomy granted to the region by the
Yugoslavia's 1974 Constitution.
   More than 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in November in
Pristina, and thousands walked off their jobs in February to protest
the amendments.
   The protests prompted Yugoslavia's federal presidency to impose a
partial state of emergency in the province last month.
   Under today's changes, Serbia would no longer need the approval
of Kosovo's Parliament to approve amendments in the Serbian
Constitution that affect the province. Serbia would also get tighter
control over the judiciary and police.
   Serbian authorities have been pressing for the changes of the
constitution, claiming they are necessary to provide greater
security for Kosovo's mainly Serbian minority, which they claim is
being harassed and forced to emigrate from the region by the ethnic
Albanian majority.
   Ethnic Albanians have disputed this claim, contending that the
Serbians are emigrating from the province due to its severe economic
problems, which include a 30 percent unemployment rate and average
monthly incomes of less than $100.
   Ethnic Albanians say that if the Kosovo legislature's approval is
no longer necessary for future constitutional changes, such rights
as the use of the Albanian language in official matters and in
education could be restricted.
   The Mladina biweekly from Yugoslavia's northern republic of
Slovenia reported in its current issue that a considerable number of
the deputies in Kosovo's Parliament have been ``invited'' in the
past few days by the state security police ``for talks and
consultations'' on how they would vote.
   Several intellectuals from the country's other republics have
claimed that the vote in Kosovo's Parliament on the amendments ``was
undemocratic since it is conducted amid emergency measures in the
province.''

<HEAD>FCC Orders Cut in Long-Distance Access Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
ordered the nation's local telephone companies to reduce their
interstate calling access charges by $705 million, which will
require American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to cut its long-distance
rates again.
   The FCC on Wednesday directed local exchange carriers to file
revisions to their interstate access rates to be effective April 1.
   The local companies last Dec. 30 proposed reductions of $489
million in the charges they levy on AT&amp;T and other long-distance
carriers to connect with the local phone networks.
   The FCC said that based upon data collected since their December
filing, the local companies had understated expected demand and
costs.
   AT&amp;T last month proposed a $533 million reduction in rates
effective April 1 to reflect the anticipated lower charges it would
have to pay the local companies.
   The $533 million cut also reflected savings to AT&amp;T from the
scheduled April 1 increase in the so-called subscriber line charge
that residential and small business customers pay to maintain the
local phone system. That charge rises by 30 cents a month to $3.50
on April 1.
   With residential and business users paying more, AT&amp;T has to pay
less, and the FCC requires AT&amp;T to pass those savings along to its
customers. AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors generally have followed
suit.
   It was not immediately clear how much AT&amp;T would have to adjust
its proposed cuts on April 1.
   That reduction would be the eighth for AT&amp;T since 1984, when the
company shed its local operating companies.
   AT&amp;T's rates have dropped about 39 percent during that period.

   A black detainee in critical
condition after 34 days on a hunger strike vowed today to maintain
his fast until the government releases him.
   Sandile Thusi, a 26-year-old researcher at the University of
Natal, told a reporter who visited him that he has lost 57 pounds,
about one-third his weight, during his fast to protest his detention
without trial.
   ``Don't worry, I'm fine,'' said Thusi, who is at St. Aidans
Hospital in the port of Durban. He appeared in good spirits and said
he had no intention of eating until he was freed.
   Thusi had an intravenous tube attached to his arm that supplies
some nutrition. Doctors have described his condition as critical and
said he risks blindness and brain damage if he continues refusing
food.
   More than 3,000 students, academics and university officials
attended a prayer service today at the University of Natal in
Durban, where Thusi worked until he was detained nine months ago.
   At a campus demonstration earlier today, the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Durban, Denis Hurley, said Thusi had ``great
courage.'' Hurley said he was upset by the ``conscience of the South
African state, which claimed to uphold Christian standards.''
   The university's vice chancellor, P.D. Booysen, said he had
appealed to government officials ``to intervene on behalf of our
dying colleague.''
   Police say they are reviewing the status of all detainees, but
have not indicated if they plan to release Thusi soon.
   About 600 detainees have staged hunger strikes for varying
periods since January, demanding to be released or put on trial. The
detainees are being held without charge under terms of the state of
emergency in effect since 1986.
   The government says it has authorized the release of 580
detainees since mid-February, but human rights groups say at least
300 people remain in detention, including 60 hunger strikers.
   Four hunger strikers who escaped Monday from a Johannesburg
hospital and took refuge at the West German Embassy in Pretoria left
their refuge Wednesday after receiving assurances they would not be
jailed. The four called for Thusi's release.

   Queen Elizabeth II distributed purses
of specially minted ``Maundy'' money today at a cathedral as part of
a centuries-old Easter tradition.
   In a ceremony dating to the 12th century, she gave out purses to
63 men and 63 women _ one for each year of her life _ who were
chosen as community leaders in England's second largest city.
   A crowd of about 5,000 people watched as she gave out the purses,
each containing 63 pence ($1.08), at St. Philip's Cathedral.
   Each year a different cathedral is chosen for the ceremony, which
is always held the Thursday before Easter.
   Originally, the monarch also washed the feet of those who
received Maundy money in memory of the washing of the disciples'
feet by Jesus Christ, but this tradition was halted in 1730.
   The queen was accompanied on her visit by her husband, Prince
Philip.

<TEXT>
   A policeman was reported in fair condition
today in the aftermath of a shootout in which another officer and a
gunman were killed at a public housing unit described as a haven for
drug users.
   The injured policeman, identified as Andrew Chelchowski, was at
the Washington Hospital Center with leg wounds, said Alexandria
police spokesman Joseph Hilleary. He was taken there by helicopter
after the shootout late Wednesday in this Washington, D.C., suburb.
   Another policeman, Cpl. Charles Hill, 40, a 13-year veteran of
the force, was killed in the shootout, as was the gunman, whose
identity was not released. Hill suffered massive head injuries from
a shotgun blast.
   The public housing unit where the gunman terrorized five hostages
and called for a ``rock'' of crack cocaine was known as a haven for
drug users, said Alexandria Mayor James Moran.
   Moran said eviction proceedings had been undertaken against the
family where the shooting happened, but he expressed frustration
with the 60-day timetable for eviction. ``It's federal property and
you have to go through a labyrinthine legal system,'' he said.
   ``There are tens of thousands of people in the metro region that
are deserving of subsidized housing and desperately in need of it,
and to have people use public housing as a crack house is
intolerable,'' he said.
   The 2{-hour siege began when the shotgun-wielding man entered the
house Wednesday afternoon and took the five hostages, police
spokesman Hilleary said.
   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' one unidentified former hostage
told WUSA-TV. ``He kept saying, `I want a rock. I'm not going to
hurt anyone, but I want a rock.'''
   Police began negotiating with the gunman and the hostages were
released one at a time, Hilleary said.
   The gunman eventually emerged from the back door, holding a
shotgun to the head of a hostage and demanding that police drop
their weapons. One officer fired at the gunman, who fired back,
shooting two policeman.
   In the ensuing fight, the hostage escaped unharmed and the gunman
was killed, Hilleary said.
   Alexandria, a historic port city, is across the Potomac River
from Washington, whose drug-related killings have earned it
notoriety as the nation's murder capital.

   Joanna Woods, 39, was slain in her home Wednesday by a
knife-wielding man who knocked on the door around 4 a.m. and forced
his way in when she answered, investigators said. The man demanded
money and started beating the woman.
   Her 12-year-old son told police he ran into the living room after
hearing his mother scream, then went to his bedroom and got the only
money he had and offered it to the man, police said.
   The boy told police the man threw it on the floor and said, ``I
don't want that. I want some money.''
   After begging for his mother's safety, the boy was ordered to his
room by the intruder. The boy came out one more time and saw his
mother being stabbed, said homicide Sgt. Terry Ross. When the man
left, the boy called police.
   Woods was stabbed in the chest, arms, hands, face, legs and back,
Ross said.

<HEAD>Order Arrest Of Stroessner Son For ``Illegal Enrichment''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LOVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered the arrest of air
force Col. Gustavo Stroessner, son of deposed President Alfredo
Stroessner, for ``illegal enrichment'' through extortion and
influence peddling, officials said today.
   The younger Stroessner accompanied his father into exile in
neighboring Brazil on Feb. 5, two days after Gen. Andres Rodriguez
staged a violent coup and proclaimed himself provisonal president.
   Criminal Court Judge Dario Caballero Bracho ordered Col.
Stroessner's arrest late Wednesday after receiving a police report
describing how he ``illictly obtained copious amounts of money.''
   The report, published in part today's edition of the Asuncion
newspaper El Diario, describes the younger Stroessner as a
``fugitive.''
   Officials said the court has the option to seek an extradition
order following investigation of the charges against Stroessner.
   The police report noted Col. Stroessner received at least
$725,000 monthly from three Asuncion bingo houses between 1985 to
1988.
   ``He used psychological pressure, saying, `If you don't give me
my cut I can close the business or give it to someone else,'''
police spokesman Osvaldo Palacios told The Associated Press.
   ``Everyone knew this man (Stroessner) had the power to decide,''
he added.
   Gambling is legal in Paraguay and bingo houses and casinos
operate under concessions granted by the government.
   The police report also noted that the younger Stroessner was a
major stockholder in the insurance company Mundo S.A. which won
several contracts from builders of two hydroelectric projects:
Itaipu on the Brazilian border and Yacyreta on the border with
Argentina.
   Col. Stroessner received $21 million in insurance fees from
Itaipu alone, the police report added.
   ``Part of this money was ill-gotten, while another portion was a
legitimate result of the business,'' Palacios said.
   The police report also said Col. Stroessner ``used his influence
to obtain contracts for third parties...in exchange for cash award.''
   Interior Minister Orlando Machuca Vargas announced, meanwhile,
that four former Stroessner government officials had been sent to
the interior of the country ``for security reasons'' while charges
against them are studied.

   Officials of Eastern Airline's striking
Machinists union and pilots union will sit on a creditors committee
that will review any bankruptcy reorganization plan the crippled
carrier proposes.
   The union representing the airline's flight attendants didn't get
a seat on the committee, a move their union president today called a
``slap in the face.'' However, the creditors' panel does include a
representative of non-union employees, most of whom were laid off a
few days after the Machinists' walkout began and are demanding back
pay.
   Harold Jones, the federal trustee supervising Eastern's
bankruptcy reorganization, appointed the 15-member committee
Wednesday. In addition to the employee representatives, the members
are mainly from aircraft and engine makers, banks and bondholders
that have claims against Eastern.
   In Tallahassee, Fla., a federal appeals court today was scheduled
to hear an Eastern request to force pilots to cross Machinists'
picket lines and go back to work.
   The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months of
contract wrangling. The pilots' support for the walkout virtually
grounded Eastern and forced it to file for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code March 9.
   The Eastern pilots are owed more than $500 million in back pay
and other claims, said Ron Cole, a spokesman in Miami for the Air
Line Pilots Association.
   Flight attendants also have honored the Machinists' picket lines.
   The creditors' committee has the right to review any
reorganization plan proposed by Eastern and can propose its own plan
to the bankruptcy judge. The unions have opposed Eastern's plans to
sell assets, including its agreement to sell its Northeast shuttle
to developer Donald Trump.
   Jones told a gathering of 400 creditor representatives, financial
analysts and reporters the role of the creditors' panel is ``far
more expansive'' than his.
   Eastern says it has $5.9 billion in assets and $4.5 billion in
liabilities. Unsecured creditors such as ticketholders and travel
agents are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy
reorganization because they have no collateral from the debtor in
case of default.
   The airline's secured creditors met with Eastern President Phil
Bakes on Tuesday.
   Eastern's liabilities include $165 million in unused tickets
issued to passengers, airline attorney Harvey Miller told the
creditors' meeting.
   ``The objective of Chapter 11 is to rebuild Eastern,'' said
Miller. ``It is Eastern's plan to resuscitate the airline and build
back its flight schedule.''
   The embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots
because only about 200 of its 3,600 pilots have crossed picket
lines. The airline has been operating less than 10 percent of its
normal schedule of 1,040 flights a day, mainly its Northeast shuttle
and Latin American routes.
   The committee representative for non-union employees is Mary
Grace Shore. She is an elected representative of a group called
PEACE, or Positive Employee Action Committee at Eastern, which union
officials allege is sponsored by Eastern management.
   Mary Jane Barry, president of a Transport Workers Union local
representing Eastern flight attendants, said in a telephone
interview from Miami that the union's exclusion from the panel is a
``slap in the face.''
   ``I think it's quite insulting that every employee group at
Eastern is on the creditors' committee except the flight
attendants,'' she said.
   She asserted that Ms. Shore is really a representative of Eastern
management and that PEACE is ``nothing but a union-busting group of
people.''

<TEXT>
   Parliament today appointed two Communist
Party members as government ministers for labor affairs at the end
of a two-day session highlighted by introduction of political
reforms.
   Acting on a recommendation by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski, the Sejm, or parliament, named Michal Czarski, 40, to be
minister of labor and social policy. It also appointed Jozef Aleksy,
43, to the Council of Ministers as the member responsible for
cooperation with trade unions.
   Referring to Poland's frequent strikes, Rakowski said it was
clear that ``relations between the state ... administration and
trade unions need special attention and tactful and careful
supervision.''
   Rakowski kept the post vacant in an October Cabinet shuffle.
   He made an attempt to draw at least four opposition figures into
his government last fall, but they declined and said they wanted to
await the results of the negotiations between Solidarity and
authorities.
   The talks are nearing completion, and parliament on Wednesday
received a package of bills intended to put into law agreements
reached at the table.
   In addition to allowing the banned Solidarity union, the farmers
union Rural Solidarity and other indepedent associations to be
legalized, the bills would alter the structure of the Polish
government.
   A freely elected Senate would be created and an office of the
president. The parliament also would be opened up to the opposition,
which could contend for up to 35 percent of the seats.
   On Friday, the government spokesman, Jerzy Urban, begins an
official visit to the United States.
   Urban said he did not plan to meet officials in Washington to
discuss aid for Poland's struggling economy and its $38 billion
foreign debt, but the government makes no secret that it will gladly
accept foreign aid.
   Urban is to arrive in New York on Friday and then travel to
Washington, where he is to meet with State Department and White
House spokesmen, said Urban's assistant, Ryszard Straus.

   Fawn Hall dissolved in tears today on the
witness stand as she described her former boss, Oliver North, as a
tireless worker at the National Security Council.
   Testifying at North's trial on 12 criminal charges, she said that
in many cases ``I would be almost falling asleep at the typewriter''
while North worked extraordinarily long hours at the NSC.
   ``He was an excellent man'' to work for, she said.
   She began to cry as she told North lawyer Brendan Sullivan that
she had met ``Colonel North, his wife, Betsy, and their four kids in
Easter of 1983.''
   When Sullivan asked her to describe the work pace, she responded
that ``it was pretty crazy'' and that North would work at the NSC
late into the night while ``everyone else would be at home with
their wife and family.''
   Sullivan asked for a break after Hall, starting to tell a story
about ``an American'' who ``was shot on the Honduran border,''
appeared unable to go on.
   It was the second interruption of the morning so that Ms. Hall
could compose herself.
   Earlier, she requested a break after questioning from prosecutor
John Keker, who kept referring to earlier testimony she had given to
Congress and a grand jury.
   She told Congress and a federal grand jury in 1987 that North had
specifically instructed her to retype memos detailing his deep
involvement with the Contras.
   In front of the North jury, she said she recalled that he asked
her to make changes. But she said ``I don't remember the exact''
word, that it's ``very hard'' to remember what happened three years
ago.
   Sullivan led her gently through the document-shredding episode
she had testified to before and asked her how long it took.
   ``I really don't know,'' she said. ``I was not looking at the
clock ... I was just doing my job.
   ``It wasn't, lock door, pull down windows, pull down the
shades,'' she added. It was no big deal.''
   When she learned on Nov. 25, 1986, that then-President Reagan had
fired North, she said, ``I was very upset ... it was very unfair.''
   Her testimony, which began in mid-afternoon Wednesday, was
completed before noon and Miss Hall left the stand appearing weary.
   At one point during her testimony, Ms. Hall began talking at the
same time as U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who told her:
``Please keep your mouth shut while I am talking.''
   Gesell then admonished Keker, saying Ms. Hall's earlier testimony
was ``wholly consistent'' with her later statements.
   When Keker resumed questioning, she asked: ``Could I take a
break?'' She stepped off the witness stand appearing distraught, and
returned five minutes later.
   In grand jury testimony in March 1987, she said she deleted
altered documents from her word processor. She told the North jury
she wasn't certain she did that.
   She testified in 1987 that she told North the day he was fired
that she was smuggling documents out of the NSC offices. She told
the North jury she simply asked him whether he could see anything in
her back.
   She testified in 1987 that she recalled North and lawyer Thomas
Green chuckling in the car after she pulled the smuggled documents
out of her boots and back of her skirt on Nov. 25, 1986. She told
the North jury that ``I don't really have a recollection of that''
but acknowledged her earlier grand jury testimony was accurate.
   She insisted there was no agreement among her, North and another
NSC staffer, Col. Robert Earl, ``to keep quiet'' about altered
documents, shredding and smuggling papers out of the NSC as the
Iran-Contra affair came unraveled.
   She said that when the Los Angeles Times ran a story on
Thanksgiving Day 1986 saying there had been shredding at the NSC
offices, she was contacted by then-White House counsel, now U.S.
attorney, Jay Stephens.
   ``I said that we shredded every day,'' said Ms. Hall.
   Asked whether she told Stephens there had been an unusually large
amount of shredding, she replied, ``I don't believe I did.''
   Asked whether she told Stephens she had altered documents and
smuggled some out of the NSC, she twice replied, ``No I didn't.''
   Asked why she didn't tell Stephens about the smuggled documents,
she said, ``I don't know. He may not have asked.''
   In testimony Wednesday, Ms. Hall acknowledged that North joked
about going to jail in 1985 when she typed false letters to Congress
denying that North was involved with the Contras. North now is
charged with lying to Congress.
   ``Colonel North made jokes and there were jokes made about''
going to jail, Hall testified. ``He is one to jest often. ... He had
a great sense of humor.''
   Hall described how at North's instructions on Nov. 21, 1986, the
day before the attorney general's aides began combing National
Security Council files for evidence of the Iran-Contra affair, she
altered several classified memos.
   The documents described North's recommendations to his superiors
on how to help the Contras, including providing aid to Guatemala
after military officials there supplied phony end-user certificates
for arms shipments to the Contras. The memos also referred to
third-country assistance to the Contras and the possibility of
seizing an arms shipment headed for Nicaragua.
   Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane had raised
questions about those memos with North in 1985, shortly before
McFarlane signed the letters to Congress containing denials of NSC
assistance to the Contras.

<TEXT>
   Authorities today granted a U.S. request
to detain two Lebanese brothers pending their extradition to the
United States on drug trafficking charges.
   The brothers, Barkev and Jean Magharian, are in custody in
Switzerland while prosecutors investigate allegations that the two
laundered illegal drug profits through Swiss banks and financial
institutions.
   Under terms of a U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, U.S. authorities
have 60 days to present a formal request for their extradition, said
the Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman, Joerg Kistler.
   The two men were indicted in U.S. federal court in New York on
March 10 on charges of cocaine trafficking.
   They were also charged two days earlier in a federal court in Los
Angeles with money laundering and the illegal export of capital.
   Swiss investigators are checking allegations that $1.25 billion
transferred to Switzerland by the brothers included drug money.
   Prosecutors said the Magharians must have been aware that at
least $22.2 million was of criminal origin.
   The money laundering scandal, known as the Lebanon Connection,
has rocked Switzerland's political and financial community and
forced the resignation of Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp.

   King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen

police and defense volunteers killed in border defense and
anti-insurgency incidents last year.
   The victims included 116 soldiers, 40 defense volunteers, six
policemen, two navy personnel and one civilian volunteer,
military-run television reported.
   In the annual rite, the king lighted a ceremonial flame during
the cremation of the 163 Buddhists at a temple on the outskirts of
Bangkok.
   The two Moslems were honored in a ceremony at the same time in
the southern provinces of Pattani and Narathiwat, where there are
large Moslem populations.
   The deputy army commander, Gen. Wanchai Ruangtrakun, has said 117
of the victims were slain in fighting with Laos over a disputed
wedge of hills along the border, and 40 were killed along the border
with Cambodia, which is being occupied by Vietnamese troops.

   The Zimbabwe Red Cross has launched an
appeal for donkeys to replace wheelchairs used by disabled people in
the countryside.
   ``What is the point of giving a disabled person a wheelchair in
the rural areas where you know it's unnavigable and long distances
are involved?'' said spokesman Victor Chitongo.
   ``A donkey has been found to be suitable because it's unlike a
wheelchair which needs repairs,'' he said. ``It feeds while the user
is in class ... the only problem arises when it can't be used to
take the disabled to the toilet.''
   Chitongo said the society was willing to pay about $15 for each
donkey, about a tenth the cost of a wheelchair.

   A passenger blamed for a fatal fire aboard a Soviet

two years of correctional labor and must pay for damages, Tass said.
   The May 17 fire killed 11 people aboard the Priamurye, which was
carrying 295 Soviet tourists and a crew of 129 on a youth cruise to
Japan.
   An investigation found the blaze broke out in the cabin of
Yevgeny Dubinin when he decided to make coffee, put an immersion
heater in a glass of water, switched it on and fell asleep, the
official news agency said.
   A visiting panel of the Law Collegium of the Russian Federation
Supreme Court returned the sentence in the Pacific port city of
Vladivostok, Tass said.
   Dubinin, who could have received three years in jail for criminal
negligence, was sentenced to two years of correctional labor with 15
percent of his wages to be taken by the state, Tass said.
   In addition, the court ordered him to pay $32,000, the news

<HEAD>Don Rhodes Walks Millie While George and Barbara Bush Are Traveling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When George and Barbara Bush are traveling, the
job of walking the first dog belongs to longtime family retainer Don
Rhodes, a shy, aw-shucks Texan who is known around the White House
as ``Millie's best friend.''
   Rhodes doesn't see much these days of his pal Millie, the Bushes'
2-year-old English springer spaniel, because she is busy nursing her
first litter of six puppies. They were born last weekend with Mrs.
Bush serving as midwife.
   When the Bushes are home, the first lady feeds Millie herself and
walks her around the White House South Lawn three or four times a
day, Rhodes says. The president occasionally takes the first pooch
along for an evening stroll around the South Lawn after dinner.
   But when they're away, Rhodes finds Millie in the second-floor
family quarters of the White House, pats her head, tosses an old
tennis ball for her to retrieve _ her favorite game _ and takes her
outside for some exercise.
   Rhodes, 51, is a lifelong bachelor who lives in a small apartment
on Capitol Hill. He's never owned a dog, yet he and Millie share
that special sort of chemistry that produces strong bonds of
affection and loyalty between man and dog.
   ``She always stops and wags her tail when she sees me coming,''
says Rhodes, his voice as soft and gentle as the wind whispering
through the piney woods of East Texas.
   ``She's a very friendly dog,'' he said. ``She's nice to
everybody, although she's sort of bashful with strangers. She likes
to please people, so to speak.
   ``She's not a rambunctious dog. Some people's dogs start running
and barking and jumping on you. She's just the opposite. She very
seldom barks, unless she's shut away in a room. She's a little
lady.''
   Millie's real name is Mildred Kerr Bush, named after a Houston
friend of Mrs. Bush. The dog was given to Mrs. Bush in February 1987
by William S. Farish, a wealthy Kentucky horse breeder and
Republican supporter, shortly after the death of her beloved cocker
spaniel, C. Fred Bush.
   Millie's first litter, five females and one male, was sired by
Tug Farish III, a year-old springer spaniel from the Farish farm at
Versailles, Ky., where Millie was born. The puppies, like their
parents, are white with liver-colored spots.
   Rhodes has been Bush's loyal personal assistant for the past
quarter-century. They met in 1964, when Rhodes was a student at
Texas A&amp;M University and Bush, campaigning unsuccessfully for the
U.S. Senate, gave a campus speech that Rhodes liked.
   Bush hired the young campaign volunteer from Houston as a file
clerk after Bush was elected to the House in 1966, and Rhodes has
been on the Bush payroll ever since.
   Nowadays, from a small office in the East Wing of the White
House, Rhodes handles the president's personal mail, pays his
incidental bills and runs errands for the Bushes.
   ``I'm just a waterboy,'' he says with a smile.
   The Bushes, however, consider him a close friend. Last year, they
invited Rhodes to join the family for Thanksgiving dinner at their
Kennebunkport, Maine, vacation home.
   Rhodes steadfastly refused to allow a photographer to take his
picture posing with Millie, or even alone.
   ``I'm bashful, too,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Runs Out Of Jurors, Sends Deputy To Round Some Up</HEAD>

   Civic duty came as a shock to 12 people
who were minding their own business in a courthouse when a burly
deputy seized their driver's licenses and told them they were
prospective jurors.
   ``I don't mind jury duty, but the way it happened was rather
frightening,'' said Paul Croskrey, who with 11 other unhappy people
was pressed into service at the order of Superior Court Judge
Richard Bartalini last week.
   Bartalini took the unusual step after he ran out of potential
jurors in a murder case Thursday and he still needed two alternates
to complete the jury roster. Invoking a rarely used law, the judge
sent his deputy to go find some jury candidates.
   ``Let's say some were more understanding than others,'' said Sgt.
George Tarnow, who told the recruits they couldn't leave the
building by an order of the court.
   Tarnow picked the 12 from a line at a window where tickets for
traffic violations and other minor offenses are paid or assigned
court dates. They were threatened with jail if they didn't come with
him.
   Bartalini told them the case they might hear could take as long
as a month.
   ``They were not happy to be there,'' said Assistant Public
Defender Howard Bloom. ``You could hear the breath whistling out of
people.''
   But the two who were eventually chosen as alternate jurors, and
the other jurors who had been chosen earlier in the day, were
thanked and sent home when they showed up for the trial Monday. The
defendant had entered a last-minute plea of no contest to a lesser
charge of voluntary manslaughter.

<TEXT>
   Short or long skirts, fitted or trapeze coats _ the
fashion capital saw several silhouettes during the winter
ready-to-wear fashion circus.
   As fashion sails into the 1990s, the passage may be a bit rough
for women looking for direction and designers who don't seem to know
where to turn.
   But the good news is that individuals are truly free to choose
their style, whether in pants and skirts or jackets and coats. And
there is no evidence of designers conspiring to put women into
stylishly ridiculous gear.
   Those fed up with the skirt-length dilemma may just abandon the
skirt altogether and wear a beautiful hacking jacket or dressier
model over opaque tights as Lagerfeld displayed at both his own and
at the Chanel collection, with an elegant bow to the 1960s.
   Elsewhere, skirts were the familiar short lengths to just above
the knee, or nearly ankle-length in trumpet shapes, pleated or
handsome in a circle of leather at Ungaro.
   Christian Lacroix went his own eccentric way, showing softly
feminine silhouettes and his favorite flowing trapeze styles. Some
loved his loud patchwork looks for ready-to-wear; others were
dazzled by his more expensive ``Luxe'' collection, shimmering with
Byzantine splendor.
   Shoulders were softened or reduced to natural proportions in
feminine silhouettes that marked the waist without undue emphasis.
   The new long jacket was gently fitted, sometimes with a
martingale belting the back, while some were asymmetrical in front,
or outlined in bold piping. Yet others appeared in swallow-tail or
cutaway style.
   Snug spencers, battle jackets and boleros shared the honors for
diminutive jacket styles.
   From the men's wardrobe but looking handsomely feminine were
pinstriped bankers' suits at Hanae Mori and the straight tweed
trousers pleated at the waist by master tailors Yves Saint Laurent
and Jean-Louis Scherrer.
   Long redingotes and short hooded duffel jackets looked terrific,
but Paris also offers some handsome belted trenches, lounging coats
or car coats in luxury cashmere or wool blends _ sometimes collared
and lined with generous lashings of fur.
   Capes were a big item at Saint Laurent and Patrick Kelly, whose
Little Red Riding Hood was a show-stealer. And Italians Angelo
Tarlazzi and Romeo Gigli placed their models in cocoon coats.
Gigli's fabulous Byzantine-embroidered cocoon made news over his
outfits in butterfly-light fabrics.
   The color spectrum zoomed from a range of darks _ especially
chocolate brown and charcoal _ to autumnal Beaujolais, cognac,
caramel, gold, mustard, olive, forest green, and misty shades of
lavender and pink.
   Claude Montana's collection brought out hues of blue, from
glacier to deep petrol in his trouser suits.
   But there were hot colors, too, and those who love red will be
happy, as every shade pepped up the runways, from garnet,
fire-engine or poppy to orange-coral, fuchsia and magenta.
   The fabrics gave new softness to the clothes, with flecked
tweeds, big and bold glen or windowpane grid plaids, looking peppy
when placed on the diagonal.
   Butter-soft leather, calfskin or suede gave the appeal of luxury
to many outfits _ remarkable when appliqued with arabesque designs
on short Yves Saint Laurent jackets.
   A taste for exoticism ran to wild-animal prints, done in various
styles and fabrics at Hanae Mori, Scherrer, Lacroix and Kelly. But
the only true furs seen were fox, vicuna, Mongolian lamb and mink.
   Montana's mink was amazing, dyed in his favorite blues and ridged
to look like chenille or corduroy. Otherwise coats looked
appealingly warm in bright mohairs or Shetland.
   Wool and silk jerseys were used generously in softer styles _
especially in dresses, which made a modest comeback for day wear.
Knits often had ethnic overtones, black and white at Chanel,
startlingly bright at Lacroix.
   For late-day, the designers came up with some stunning cocktail
suits or dresses with jackets _ all fit to sup at the Ritz. Among
the most memorable: Chanel's lightly fitted gold corduroy-ridged
lame jacket over a satin-piped wrapped skirt topped with floppy
satin bows.
   Black velvet gave opulent allure to day or evening clothes, and
crimped panne or cut velvet added old-fashioned charm to much of the
evening wear.
   In fact, fabrics for after sunset were so luxurious that they
defined the lines of the outfit. Satin and slithery crepe de chine
were favorites for slinky dinner gowns or pajamas.
   Black silk ``grain de poudre'' was used in all versions of the
``smoking'' or tuxedo style _ still a wardrobe staple, whether with
pants or a skirt.
   Sheer chiffon revealed body lines, while iridescent taffeta
lightly puffed around it in other models. Lame fabrics and
embroidery made evening wear look bewitchingly shimmering, sometimes
sexy, but never glitzy.
   And the lame brocades at houses like Hanae Mori, Lacroix and
Saint Laurent shone with an extra dash of exoticism as the designers
went at least partly to the Far East, Byzantium or North Africa for
inspiration.

<TEXT>
   Toshiba Corp. and Fuji Photo Film Co. said Thursday
they will jointly develop a new type of electronic camera that can
show photos on TV monitors immediately after the picture is taken
without processing.
   A similar camera was introduced by Sony Corp. last year, but the
Toshiba-Fuji system is aimed to record images as digital signals,
enabling easy transmission of pictures using personal computers and
telephone lines.
   ``There are hundreds of advantages in the digitalized system,''
said Shozo Iijima, Toshiba's chief engineer. ``The system will bring
revolutionary changes in the field of still pictures.''
   Digital electronic signals will be stored on a floppy disc inside
the camera. Because it is recorded digitally, pictures can be stored
in personal computers, Iijima said.
   The camera will be too costly for broad commercialization.
   ``The memory portion of the system involving semiconductors is
too expensive with the current cost of microchips,'' Iijima said.
``So the main objective of our project is to lower the cost of the
memory without reducing the quality of the picture.''
   Officials of the two companies predicted the system will be
available by 1990 for industrial use and by 1991 for commerical use.
Toshiba and Fuji Film also said they plan to call on other
electronic and camera manufacturers to standarize the format of the
digital camera system.

   An American Airlines jet took off from
the wrong runway in Houston today and struck a metal barricade, but
continued to a safe landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, federal officials said.
   There were no injuries on Flight 508, which arrived on time at
Dallas, its intended destination, the airline said. The Federal
Aviation Administration said more than 90 people were on board.
   The MD-80 jet mistakenly took off from a runway undergoing
construction at Houston's Hobby Airport and marked for use by light
planes only, said Geraldine Cook, spokeswoman for the FAA's regional
office in Fort Worth.
   The plane struck a construction barricade at the end of the
shortened runway as it took off, damaging the plane's tail section,
Ms. Cook said.
   The pilot did not advise the tower he had struck anything and
continued on to Dallas-Fort Worth, she said.
   Ground crews noticed the downed barricade, some debris and marks
on the runway that indicated the tail was dragged, she said.
   She did not know if any action will be taken against the pilot,
who had twice been cleared to take off on a nearby runway.
   American Airlines officials would not confirm or deny that the
jet hit a barrier.

   A high school wrestling coach has been
convicted of a misdemeanor battery charge for biting off part of a
man's ear during a fight that began as a traffic dispute.
   Scott Vlink, 33, coach at Crown Point High School, will be
sentenced April 26 by Judge Nicholas Schiralli in Lake Superior
Court.
   He could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and fined $5,000
in connection with the May 19, 1987, incident on the courthouse
square in Crown Point.
   The jury deliberated about an hour Wednesday before returning the
verdict.
   According to testimony, Vlink bit off Donald Dugger's earlobe
during the altercation which began as Dugger, also of Crown Point,
crossed a street.
   Dugger alleged that a car nearly hit him. He said he made a
kicking motion toward the car, and that the driver, whom he
identified as Vlink, got out and started fighting.

<TEXT>
   A new tower will be built to replace the
900-year-old structure that collapsed last week, authorities
announced Thursday.
   A request for the appropriation of funds had been filed to the
government ``to restore the symbol of this city,'' said Lionello
Costanza Fattori, head of the regional office for protection of
monuments.
   Four people were killed and 15 were injured when the 255-foot
tower collapsed March 17 onto a downtown square of this northern
city.
   City officials also announced they would inspect other medieval
towers and monuments. A 501-year-old cathedral adjacent to the tower
suffered substantial damage in the collapse.
   Experts said the collapse may have been caused by a sudden
sinking following a three-month dry spell that lowered the water
table. Others blamed natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks
together.

<HEAD>Group Undertaking Campaign as Court Prepares to Consider Crucial
Case</HEAD>

   An abortion rights group said Thursday it is
undertaking a $2 million media and grass roots organizing campaign
in an effort to bolster ``pro-choice'' forces as the Supreme Court
prepares to consider a crucial abortion case.
   ``Between now and the end of April, we will run a 34-state field
operation including targeting specific media markets,'' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League.
   The Washington-based group describes itself as ``the largest
national, non-partisan organization working solely to keep abortion
safe, legal and accessible.''
   In late April, the Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in
a Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. The
court's ruling in a landmark 1973 case, Roe vs. Wade, legalized
abortion in the United States.
   Ms. Michelman told a news conference that ``we will lobby in
state legislatures across the country. We will make the point that
there is a strong, active, politically savvy constituency out there
who won't sit by and watch their right to make a private, personal
choice be taken away.''
   ``The overall goal of this campaign is to organize a politically
powerful grass roots constituency that will flex its political
muscle in the 1990 and 1992 elections,'' she said.
   Ms. Michelman said her organization last week hired the
Washington firm of Greer, Margolis, Mitchell and Associates to
create the national media campaign, which will include print,
television and radio advertising.
   She said that as of last Friday, 118,000 people across the
country had signed up to assist grass roots organizing efforts. The
abortion rights league plans to send thousands of activists to
Washington to take part in an April 9 ``March for Women's Lives,''
Ms. Michelman said.

<HEAD>Drought Holds GNP Growth to 2.4 Percent in Late '88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy expanded at a moderate 2.4 percent
annual rate in the last three months of 1988, the government
reported Thursday, but analysts said the figure was held down by
last summer's drought and masked strong underlying growth at year's
end.
   The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure
of economic health, would have been closer to 3.5 percent last
quarter were it not for the drought, the Commerce Department said.
   Analysts are divided over how much of that momentum extended into
1989, but most expect a slowdown as the aging economic expansion
stretches through its seventh year.
   The fourth-quarter GNP figure was revised upward from an initial
government estimate of 2 percent and contributed to growth of 3.9
percent for all of 1988, the best showing since a 6.8 percent
increase in 1984.
   ``The upward revision underscores a banner year for the economy
growthwise in 1988 and indicates the strong momentum that the
economy carried over into 1989,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the
Boston Co. Inc.
   Several recent government reports, however, have offered signs
the economy already may be cooling off in response to efforts by the
Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates to dampen inflationary
pressures.
   Retail sales, housing construction, orders for durable goods and
factory operating rates all were down last month, while inflation
remained above last year's levels.
   The Federal Reserve wants to slow growth to a more sustainable
pace to reverse what Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has called
``disturbing'' price increases, although some critics are afraid the
central bank could go too far and push the country into a recession.
   Economist Lawrence Chimerine of the Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., said the critical question is how significantly the economy is
cooling, although it appears the nation is moving toward slower
growth rather than an outright downturn.
   ``It's much too premature to conclude we're heading into a
recession,'' Chimerine said.
   The Fed's anti-inflation efforts and a trade deficit that is
worsening as the export boom stalls both are expected to contribute
to slower growth this year.
   GNP growth is likely to decline by more than a percentage point
in 1989 to around 2.7 percent, analysts believe, despite an
anticipated sharp upswing in the first quarter due to a rebound from
the drought.
   The Bush administration is counting on growth of 3.2 percent to
help it reduce the federal budget deficit while adhering to the
president's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.
   The government next month will release its initial estimate for
GNP growth in the first quarter. Forecasters are pegging the figure
at around 4.7 percent, with a 2.5 percentage-point boost from the
farm rebound masking a broader economic slowdown.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said the
economy could be particularly sluggish in the second half of this
year, with the risk of recession running at about 40 percent.
   Nevertheless, the Fed had ``no choice but to tighten'' its grip
on the money supply, given the troubling inflation numbers, Evans
said.
   Some analysts warn the nation could experience a double negative
this year if the economy cools but inflation fails to respond
quickly to that slowdown.
   ``This may be the year in which real growth may be slowing while
inflation is accelerating,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston &amp; Co.
   An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5.3
percent in the October-December quarter, up from 4.7 percent in the
third quarter. Those figures represent high levels for the GNP
deflator, which had risen at an annual rate of 3.8 percent or less
for the last three years.
   Corporate profits, meanwhile, were up 2.8 percent in the fourth
quarter and 14.6 percent for all of 1988, the government reported.
Last year's increase was the biggest since a 22.4 percent
post-recession jump in 1983.
   The upward revision in last quarter's GNP figure reflected higher
government spending than earlier estimated and a smaller drop in
business investment.
   Those gains were partially offset by a larger trade deficit as
the gap between imports and exports grew at an annual rate of $11.5
billion during the quarter, the biggest widening in more than three
years.
   Exports grew by 6.5 percent during the three-month period, but
the increase was overwhelmed by a 13.5 percent rise in imports.
   The GNP's 2.4 percent rate of growth last quarter, held back by
the drought, was the slowest advance since a 1.4 percent rise in the
fourth quarter of 1986 and followed an increase of 2.5 percent in
the third quarter, which also was affected by the drought.
   The economy expanded at a 3.4 percent clip in the first quarter
of last year and at a 3 percent pace in the second.

<HEAD>Sonar Fails to Find Container of Insecticide In Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHERBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities searching the English
Channel for a container of deadly insecticide detected an object on
sonar, but it turned out to be a block of reinforced concrete, the
navy said Thursday.
   The container was lost when the Indonesian ship Perintis sank in
a storm March 13 northwest of the Channel Islands.
   Ecologists say that if the containeer spills its six tons of
toxic Lindane insecticide, it could cause an ecological disaster
with dire consequences for the next 30 years.
   Lindane is used widely by European farmers, and small amounts
routinely wash down the rivers to the sea. But large amounts of it
would kill fish.
   Two French navy mine sweepers have been searching for the
container in sometimes heavy seas, and their sonar detected an
object similar to the container Wednesday.
   But two mini-submarines determined the object lying in 400 feet
of water near a World War II ammunition dump was a block of concrete.
   Rhone-Poulenc, which manufactures Lindane in France, says it
would not dissolve easily in the cold waters of the channel. It is
also well packed in strong plastic sacks inside the reinforced
container, company officials said.
   The French government said small quantities of Lindane had been
traced in waters near the mouth of the Seine River but added that
these were normal and well below limits allowed in Europe.
   The container was originally retrieved with five others from the
wreck of the Perintis by the French navy, but the container was lost
again when tow ropes snapped as it was being hauled back to
Cherbourg port.

   Arriving at last year's Academy Awards was a
feature-length disaster starring some of Hollywood's biggest names.
This year, some of the biggest names in city traffic control say
there will be no sequel.
   Limousines making their way to the 1988 awards ceremony at the
Shrine Auditorium came to a dead stop in sweltering smog, many
blocks short of their destination. For hours they sat motionless in
a high-glamour gridlock as the clock ticked toward the televised
show's opening credits.
   Acting nominee and presenter Glenn Close, nine months pregnant,
finally emerged from her limo and hiked up Jefferson Boulevard to
make the ceremony on time. Others followed suit, among them Olivia
de Havilland and Meryl Streep.
   ``I saw quite a few gorgeous women holding their skirts with one
hand and high-heel shoes with the other, out of breath and trying to
get in on time,'' said official Oscar greeter Army Archerd.
   ``Hundreds of dollars in hairdressing and makeup were ruined
because they had to run in the broiling sun,'' he said.
   A tribute to Oscar's 60th birthday, presenting nominees from all
59 previous ceremonies, had to be scratched because so many
principals were late.
   ``It was a nightmare,'' said Dav-El Limousines chauffeur Rick
Cameron. ``We actually rehearsed the drive the day before, but we
had no idea it would be as bad as it was.'' He said he arrived with
moments to spare.
   Another celebrity who got stuck was Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley. Needless to say, things will be done a little differently
this year.
   Within days of last year's debacle, a team of traffic experts
began work to assure a smooth street performance for the 61st
Academy Awards next Wednesday, said Timothy F. Crowder, a city
traffic engineer who handles special events.
   The team concluded there were several problems, including too
many vehicles trying to squeeze through narrow Royal Street at the
front of the auditorium to unload their passengers in a timely
fashion.
   Among the changes this year is a different celebrity arrival area
with five lanes to accommodate the big cars.
   The number of traffic officers will be nearly doubled from last
year, Crowder said, along with street engineers trained to rearrange
traffic patterns while an event is occurring.
   Officials also will use Automatic Traffic Surveillance and
Control, a system linked by fiber optics to a centralized computer
to adjust signal lights. The system was installed in the area for
the 1984 Summer Olympics.
   Crowder said officials expect 500 to 800 limousines for Oscar
night, along with 800 passenger cars. Inside the auditorium will be
5,700 guests, another 550 people devoted to production of the live 9
p.m. EST broadcast on ABC-TV, and about 150 Academy personnel.
   ``The city does not look good when things like this happen,''
Crowder said of last year's traffic jam. ``This is the home of the
film industry, and we don't want to lose something like the Oscars
to somewhere else.''

<HEAD>Track Star Lewis Calls for Random Steroid Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Track superstar Carl Lewis said Thursday it was
his ``guess'' that as many as 10 Olympic medals last summer went to
athletes using anabolic steroids, and he urged random testing at all
levels of sports competition.
   ``We want to elevate ourselves ethically to the point where
everyone sacrifices ourselves to make the sport clean,'' the
three-time Olympian and winner of six gold medals told a
congressional subcommittee.
   Lewis received a gold medal in the 100-meter dash at last
summer's Olympics in South Korea after the first contestant to cross
the finish line, Canada's Ben Johnson, tested positive for anabolic
steroids, compounds that develop strength and speed but which are
banned as dangerous drugs.
   Lewis told members of the House Judiciary Committee's crime
subcommittee he felt certain that other medal winners also were
steroid users.
   ``I would say at least five to 10 if I had to guess ... and some
of those were gold medals,'' said Lewis, in answer to a question
from Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.
   Members of the subcommittee, which is weighing proposed
legislation to ban mail-order steroids, did not ask Lewis the names
of other users who may have won medals. He ducked the question when
reporters asked him after the hearing.
   ``That's not the issue,'' he said. ``The issue is that it should
be zero.''
   He departed from the view of a number of other athletes as well
as civil liberties group when asked about testing.
   ``I think we're getting to the point where we have to randomly,''
Lewis said. ``It's at every level.''
   He also called for investigation of coaches who may be working
with steroid suppliers and forcing athletes to use the substances.
He said some coaches deliberately train athletes the wrong way if
they refuse to take the drugs as a way of prodding them to do so.
   Other coaches may be slipping steroids into the vitamins of the
athletes under their supervision, Lewis said.
   He did say that most coaches and athletes shun steroids but that
the problem is growing and the sports world should be more outspoken
about it. In turn, lawmakers paid homage to Lewis for his own candor.
   ``In a world in which that is a rare commodity, I hope that you
are never bludgeoned into verbal submission,'' said Rep. Romano L.
Mazzoli, D-Ky.
   Rep. Fortney (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., sponsor of the legislation,
told the subcommittee it was necessary to tell prospective buyers
that ``their is no prescription pharmacy in your mailbox.''

   Two East German teen-agers fled to
West Germany from Czechoslovakia under a salvo of warning shots, and
a third East German man escaped by swimming the Werra River, West
German police said Thrusday.
   The two 18-year-old East Germans reported Wednesday to
authorities near the West German town of Tirchenreuth about 120
miles north of Munich, Bavarian border police said.
   Several warning shots were fired by Czechoslovak border guards
but the two were uninjured, police said.
   The third East German fled his communist homeland by swimming
Wednesday across the Werra River, which forms part of the border
with East Germany about 95 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   Police said the 20-year-old electrician reached the West German
side of the river uninjured and apparently was not noticed by East
German border guards.

<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday appealed for
$28.5 million in international aid to rebuild roads, bridges,
buildings and water systems damaged this month by floods, an
earthquake and a cyclone.
   The money was urgently needed for initial damage repairs, and
more will be necessary later for emergency food supplies and
long-term reconstruction, the state National Disaster Preparedness
and Relief Committee said.
   About 115,000 people were left homeless by torrential rain, the
earthquake and a cyclone that struck during a 10-day period earlier
this month. An unspecified number of people were killed.
   About three-fourths of the $28.5 million will be used to rebuild
damaged homes and public buildings, and to repair bridges, roads and
water systems, said Alfred Upinde, the vice chairman of the disaster
commmittee.
   Some of the aid will provide blankets, mats and cooking utensils
for disaster victims, he told reporters.
   Emmanuel Gondwe, the government's secretary for district
administration and rural development, said an international appeal
for food will be launched when authorities have assessed the full
extent of losses of crops and livestock.
   Disaster victims are being fed with emergency food stocks
intended for 350,000 people in northern Malawi whose crops were
affected by a plant disease, Gondwe said.
   The food will soon have to be replenished, he said, and other
appeals later will seek aid for long-term rebuilding and replanting
in devastated farmlands.
   Among the victims are some of the 650,000 refugees who have fled
the war in neighboring Mozambique.
   On Wednesday, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies launched a separate appeal in Switzerland for $1.5 million
for disaster victims.

   Yasser Arafat said Thursday the second
formal meeting between U.S. and PLO representatives was positive and
reflected the desire of both sides to make the dialogue a success.
   To a reporter who asked the smiling chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization whether Wednesday's meeting was responsible
for his good mood, Arafat replied: ``Yes, exactly.''
   He described the content of the meeting between U.S. Ambassador
Robert H. Pelletreau and Yasser Abed-Rabbo of the PLO executive
committee as ``positive and serious,'' but gave few details of the
discussion.
   ``There is a mutual interest and intention to lead this dialogue
to success,'' Arafat said.
   Pelletreau and Abed-Rabbo met for 4{ hours at the Tunisian
government's Dar el Maghreibia guest house, with two senior advisers
present on each side. The ambassador would not talk about the
meeting and referred all inquiries to the State Department.
   Arafat said: ``No one has the right to say what they asked of us
or what we asked of them.''
   Did the Americans ask him to stop the 15-month-old uprising in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that has taken the
lives of more than 400 Palestinians? ``No one presented such a
request and no one can ask a people to stop resisting an
occupation,'' he replied.
   It was the second formal meeting since talks began in December,
after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's
right to exist. There was no indication whether a third meeting was
scheduled, but the PLO chief's mood suggested the dialogue will
continue.
   ``The fact that the agenda was loaded with a lot of subjects to
be discussed shows clearly the importance given to it both by the
U.S. administration and the PLO,'' he said. ``Its importance is even
greater if you take into consideration all the Israeli efforts to
stop it.''
   Arafat reiterated his demand for an international peace
conference on the Middle East with the participation of the nations
involved, the PLO and the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain
and France.
   ``This is the position announced by the Arab summits in
Casablanca, Amman and Algiers and it is very similar and parallel to
the European, Soviet, Chinese and non-aligned position on the same
issue,'' he said. ``The American administration is in principle for
an international conference, but says it should be very well
prepared.''
   Asked about reports that the PLO would consider the possibility
of American soldiers replacing the Israelis in south Lebanon, Arafat
said: ``We accept United Nations forces under the U.N. flag to
replace the Israeli army in the territory, but I never mentioned the
U.S. Army.''
   On Wednesday, Arafat's spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said American
soldiers could play a transitional role and help oversee free
elections in an independent Palestinian state.
   To a question about Palestinian measures to reduce tension in the
Middle East, Arafat said it should be addressed to the Israelis
because ``it is they who are causing tension, with the Israeli army
and the armed settler groups using force against the Palestinians.''
   ``The essential question is whether the Israeli army and air
force will stop bombarding villages and Palestinian camps in
southern Lebanon,'' he said.
   He was asked about the unexplained delay in organizing an exile
Palestinian government and said the Palestine National Council
wanted to include representatives of Palestinians living inside
Palestine, which includes Israel.
   ``We need to know how the Israelis will react to those who are
appointed,'' he said. ``Will they deport them, or put them in jail,
or put them to death?''
   The Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, declared Palestinian independence last November.
   Arafat said of Israel's readiness to deal with Palestinians
outside the PLO: ``According to an internal rule of the PLO, there
is not a single Palestinian who is not in the PLO.''
   He will let Israel name the Palestinian delegates to an
international conference, Arafat said, ``if Israel will not object
to me naming the Israeli delegation.''

<HEAD>Arkansas Legislature Acts To Remove Vestiges of Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES JEFFERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than three decades after fighting
federally ordered integration, the Arkansas Legislature took a
series of landmark steps to shed the state's segregrationist past.
   The keystone of the legislative session concluded last week was
the approval of a $118 million settlement in a lingering civil
rights lawsuit stemming from state and local actions that the
plaintiffs said helped resegregate inner-city schools in Little Rock
and encourage ``white flight'' to the suburbs. The settlement
includes beefing up city schools and redrawing some school district
boundaries.
   ``A national statement for desegregation was made today,'' Little
Rock school board member Skip Rutherford said after the state House
of Representatives narrowly approved the settlement.
   ``It was a clear determination on the part of a majority of the
legislators to put the legacy of 1957 behind us forever,'' Gov. Bill
Clinton said in an interview this week.
   It was 1957 when then-Gov. Orval Faubus refused to allow nine
black students to enter the all-white Central High School. President
Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered federal troops to Central to keep the
peace and enforce court-ordered desegregation.
   In addition to approving the settlement, lawmakers this session
voted overwhelmingly to repeal more than a dozen laws passed during
the late 1950s and early 1960s to preserve segregated schools.
   One statute required local school officials to consider public
sentiment in making school assignments. Another provided for
jailhouse school board meetings in case board members were jailed
for disobeying integration orders.
   A co-sponsor of the legislation to repeal the segregation laws
was freshman Rep. Ben McGee, the first black since Reconstruction to
represent the largely black Mississippi River Delta region of
eastern Arkansas.
   ``What's historic about the whole thing was the commitment on the
part of people to wipe the slate clean,'' said McGee, who noted that
some of the votes to repeal the segregation laws came from lawmakers
who had helped adopt them years ago.
   Lawmakers also decided to put on the November ballot a measure
asking voters to repeal a 1956 amendment to the state constitution
that required the Legislature to pass laws and use all other means
necessary to circumvent federal desegregation rulings. Any state or
local official could be prosecuted for failure to enforce state laws
to preserve segregation.
   Faubus, now 79, said this week that repealing the old laws and
attempting to amend the constitution is commendable but unnecessary.
   ``All those things had been nullified by the federal court
rulings,'' he said. ``I'm not objecting to it, but I think it's
mostly posturing and for propaganda purposes.''
   Faubus does object to the settlement involving the Little Rock,
North Little Rock and Pulaski County Special school districts.
   ``It may turn out as one of the worse things that ever
happened,'' said Faubus, who served six terms as governor. ``This
could break the state government. There's no limit to what it could
cost, and there's no limit to how many lawsuits that can be filed.
These lawyers are making too much money to let it stop.''
   Clinton calls the agreement a model for other states grappling
with desegregation issues, and he and other proponents argue it
could buffer the state from liability in any future desegregation
litigation. At least two such lawsuits are pending.
   Lawmakers from outside Pulaski County _ Little Rock and the
surrounding area _ were angry that money earmarked for schools in
their districts will be funneled into the Pulaski schools, among the
state's wealthiest. Rep. Lloyd George called the settlement an
open-ended ``entitlement program'' that ultimately could cost the
state more than $260 million.
   In addition to the money the state agreed to pay in the
settlement, court orders in the case require the state to fund other
compensatory programs in the Little Rock district and pay $9.3
million a year for the operation of magnet schools designed to
attract white students back to the Little Rock district.
   Also approved were programs _ such as mandatory kindergarten and
college grants to entice more minority students into teaching _
drafted to benefit blacks.
   The state Senate easily approved the settlement, 31-2. But it
took four ballots in the House before the agreement finally passed,
54-42, just 30 minutes before the 68-day session ended Friday.
   Of the House members who changed their votes in the final ballot,
Clinton said: ``They concluded that the old tried-and-true Southern
strategy of whipping up on the federal courts had never worked for

   He complimented the legislators from outside Pulaski County for
voting for the settlement.
   ``We are trying to close the books on the Little Rock crisis and
essentially make a statement that we're committed to equal
opportunity, to giving all of our children a chance to learn, and
that we're committed to a progressive course in education, economic
development and race relations,'' Clinton said.
   ``We have to deal with all of those things if this state and its
people are ever going to fulfill their potential.''

   A young man was charged today with murdering
a 13-year-old neighbor girl found stabbed and strangled three weeks
ago in the basement of the home he shares with his parents and
teen-age brother.
   Robert Golub, 21, surrendered to police and was ordered held
without bail.
   ``This defendant is charged with the vicious, savage killing of a
13-year-old girl,'' Assistant District Attorney Daniel Cotter argued
at the arraignment.
   Richard and Victoria Tinyes, whose daughter, Kelly, was slain,
stood quietly in a courtroom hallway.
   County Chief of Detectives Wayne Seay said Golub's arrest was
based on ``significant and substantial forensic evidence,'' which
Cotter said included a bloody palm print found at the murder scene
in Golub's basement.
   Golub, a muscular, 5-foot-3 weightlifter, maintains his
innocence, his attorney, John O'Grady, said.
   Neighbors and relatives of the girl, angry that police had not
made an arrest, had driven the Golubs from their house in Valley
Stream on Long Island earlier this week.
   Kelly had been seen entering the Golub house on March 3 after
reportedly receiving a phone call from John Jr., 14.
   Police had said the Golub brothers, both of whom were at home on
the afternoon of the killing, were the main focus of their
investigation.
   Police announced last week that they had enough evidence to make
an arrest, but District Attorney Denis Dillon said he wanted to
present the case to a grand jury to strengthen it. The grand jury
heard testimony Wednesday.

   Charges of resisting arrest have been
dropped against a black policeman whose head shattered a plate glass
window in a confrontation with a white officer that was videotaped
by a news crew.
   ``I'm very elated,'' Don Jackson, 30, said after the prosecutor
announced there was not enough evidence to bring him to trial
Wednesday.
   Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant who has accused white
officers of racism, set up his own ``sting'' by traveling into
nearby Long Beach on Jan. 14 in a car while an NBC news crew
followed.
   Jackson's vehicle was pulled over by police. In a scene later
televised on NBC, Jackson's head is seen apparently being smashed
into a store window. The city filed charges of resisting arrest.
   On Wednesday, Deputy City Prosecutor John Vander Lans told
Municipal Judge Gary Hahn there was insufficient evidence to obtain
a conviction.
   Vander Lans said he based his decision on the videotape; the
testimony by the arresting officer, Mark Dickey, during a state
Senate hearing, and interviews with witnesses.
   Police said Jackson's car had been weaving in traffic, and
officials had suggested Jackson instigated the confrontation through
his words and actions.
   But Dickey told the state Senate panel that Jackson had never
sworn at him as he had stated in his police report. The officer
attributed the discrepancy to a faulty memory.
   After the charge was dismissed, Jackson denounced Long Beach
authorities' attempt to prosecute him as ``a ridiculous spectacle.''
   Jackson is on disability leave from the Hawthorne department
because he contends he suffered stress as a result of racism there.
   Mike Minton, a spokesman for the Long Beach Police Officers'
Association, criticized the decision to drop the case.
   ``The Don Jacksons of the world are going to go out there and try
to intimidate police officers, and somebody is going to get hurt,''
he said.
   Jackson's lawyer, Thomas E. Beck, said he has filed a complaint
with the state bar against Vander Lans alleging malicious
prosecution and claimed city officials conspired against Jackson.
Vander Lans denied the charge.

   This small eastern South Dakota town has done
without one of the more common trappings of the modern world for 113
years _ a paved Main Street.
   But Crooks residents voted Tuesday to cover up the past by
approving a $70,000 project that will put pavement on Main.
   Work to lay the asphalt carpet will begin this spring on the 2{
blocks made up of mud and gravel.
   ``You bet it's a big deal,'' Mayor Paul Anderson said Wednesday.
``One of the things we've found is when we go out and try to lure a
business into Crooks, a paved Main Street is a priority.''
   Crooks, located about 10 miles northwest of Sioux Falls, began as
a settlement called New Hope in 1876. The town changed its name in
1904 to honor the then-postmaster and banker D.O. Crooks.
   Although most of the town's 750 residents work in Sioux Falls,
there are about a dozen businesses and Anderson said he would like
to attract more.
   ``It seems to have an effect on the general feeling of the
community as a whole,'' he said. ``A lot of people come and drive
through and they won't stop.''
   Residents approved a $20,000 bond issue to help pay for the
project 100-47.

   What's an annual Crawfish Festival without a
crawfish mascot?
   Not much, decided Woodbine city officials, so they got a friend
of a resident to stitch up a costume.
   The Woodbine Citizens Steering Committee unveiled ``Crawford''
Tuesday night.
   ``I think it turned out very well,'' Fran Hewitt, the costume's
designer, said from her home in Marietta, Ohio.
   Mrs. Hewitt, a housewife who has been designing costumes for 20
years, said she has designed costumes resembling bears, rabbits,
ducks and geese to entertain children, but never a crawfish.
   Woodbine's deputy city clerk, Sandy Rayson, sent her a crawfish
in a box to help spur her creative juices, Mrs. Hewitt said. She
said she had seen crawfish before, but ``never that big.''
   Her biggest challenge with the costume was finding a place
through which its inhabitant could breathe and see. She settled on
the crawfish's mouth.
   ``Crawford'' will be featured in the fourth annual Crawfish
Festival parade April 29.

   A state senator says he has found the
appropriate time to hear testimony on a bill to make The Kingsmen's
classic recording of ``Louie Louie'' the official state rock song.
   ``My hunch is we'll get it in with the nut bills,'' said Sen.
Glenn Otto, a member of the Senate Government Operations and
Elections Committee.
   Otto hastened to add that he meant two bills to designate the
hazelnut and the chinquapin as official Oregon nuts.
   Otto earlier referred to the song as ``Lousy, Lousy.''
   The bill's author, Sen. Bill Bradbury, admits that the idea of
giving official state status to the world's most-recorded rock song
was a gimmick to get some free entertainment.
   ``Can I be honest with you?'' Bradbury said Tuesday. ``The
reality of the bill was to get The Kingsmen down here to play'' at a
legislative party last week.
   The lure was enough to persuade several members of The Kingsmen,
who recorded the original ``Louie, Louie'' in Portland in 1963, to
show up at the party and play music for free, Bradbury said.
   Bradbury plans to continue to push the bill even though an
identical measure died without a hearing in the 1987 Legislature.

<HEAD>National Head Count Could Cost $3 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next year's national head count could cost $3
billion, Congress was told Thursday. But Census Bureau officials
doubt they'll have to spend quite that much.
   ``We estimate that the 1990 census will cost about $2.6
billion,'' deputy census director C. Louis Kincannon told the House
census subcommittee.
   But Gene L. Dodaro of the General Accounting Office told the
subcommittee he believes the bureau is underestimating the cost.
   ``On the basis of continued inflation and more current cost
estimates, we believe that the 1990 census, as planned, will cost
about $3 billion,'' Dodaro testified.
   Kincannon responded that ``factors outside our control, such as
lower than expected mail-return rates or productivity, could
increase costs,'' but added that ``we do not expect that to happen.''
   The 1980 national head count eventually cost $1.1 billion.
Initial estimates had been lower.
   More than 100 million census forms will be mailed a year from
now, with the constitutionally mandated count scheduled for April 1,
1990.
   ``Political representation and money are allocated based on
census results and the data are used for planning at every level of
government and in the private sector,'' Kincannon pointed out.
   He and Dodaro agreed that a major problem will be recruiting the
estimated 480,000 temporary workers the bureau is expected to need
to do the counting.
   In test counts last year, Kincannon said, the bureau found that
its planned wage range of $5.50 to $6 an failed to attract workers
in some areas. Thus, he said, officials are developing a regional
pay scale keyed to local costs and salaries.
   Even so, with many two-earner families, fewer people are
available to recruit for these temporary jobs.
   Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., suggested one possible solution
would be to recruit census enumerators from among retired federal
workers around the country, if rules can be changed to allow them to
be paid without reducing their retirement benefits.
   Dodaro and Kincannon supported that idea. Ridge and Rep. Thomas
C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, said they were introducing legislation to allow
the retirees to take these temporary jobs without benefit cuts.
   Kincannon also said major efforts are underway to better count
the homeless and minorities.
   Meanwhile, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund
launched its effort to encourage Hispanics to be counted.
   With the census numbers used to apportion seats in the House,
state legislatures and other governing bodies, many minority groups
will be encouraging members to participate in the count.
   ``Hagase contar,'' or ``Make Yourself Count,'' is the slogan of
the Mexican-American effort.

<TEXT>
   It takes courage, heart and brains to take on
Judy Garland and the Wicked Witch of the West.
   But producer-director Michel M. Grilikhes (``Disney on Parade'')
has attempted to do so with a live road show of ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' which opened Wednesday night at Radio City Music Hall and will
visit 70 cities after it leaves New York April 9.
   The $7.5 million production features flying monkeys and sparkling
human snowflakes, a fire-throwing evil witch, a computerized Yellow
Brick Road and a house that chugs along an overhead dolly. But with
all the stage gimmicks and pyrotechnics, it's a long, slow trip to
Emerald City.
   Grilikhes, who spent 12 years trying to adapt the 1939 film
classic version of the L. Frank Baum stories, closely follows the
film script and includes all the Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg songs
from the original. But the staging is stiff, the pacing slow and the
direction falters.
   Still, it is a delightful event for families, and in those
communities without repertory companies or little theaters, the
production is a wonderful way to introduce children to live
performances. However those under 3 might grow restless by the time
Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion reach
the Witch's castle.
   The story opens in Kansas, of course, with a set as flat as the
plains. Fourteen-year-old Dorothy lives on a farm with her Auntie Em
and Uncle Henry and three lovable farm hands. Her little dog, Toto,
takes a nip out of mean spinster, Miss Gulch, who takes the pooch
off to be dispatched to that great dog pound in the sky.
   Toto escapes, finds Dorothy and they run away from home. She
meets Prof. Marvel who persuades her to return home. She does, just
as a tornado is twisting through the landscape.
   The house is lifted by wires to a figure-eight dolly on the dome
of the Music Hall, where it totters slowly over part of the
orchestra like a car on a ferris wheel. The effect doesn't work.
There is no brutal force _ even the sound effects and lighting are
limp.
   The house crashes on the Wicked Witch of the East, Dorothy meets
Glinda the good witch, gets the bad witch's ruby slippers and heads
off to Emerald City to see the Wizard so she can be sent home.
   As Dorothy, the diminutive 23-year-old Grace Grieg is appealing,
but her singing voice is thin as she attempts ``Somewhere Over the
Rainbow,'' and the supposedly tiny Munchkins tower above her. She
was spotted by Grilikhes while appearing as Snow White in a Las
Vegas production of ``Beach Blanket Babylon.'' Joe McDonough is no
Ray Bolger but does a splendid job as the Scarecrow. Joe Giuffre's
Tin Man is less inspirational but adequate. Guy Allen is lovable as
the Lion. Polly Feale rivals Margaret Hamilton as Miss Gulch and the
Wicked Witch. In many respects, she's even more sinister. Bart
Williams is the Wizard, Prof. Marvel and the guard at Emerald City.
   Toto _ actually five trained terriers _ appears and disappears
with great frequency.
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' includes a cast of 42 performers, huge sets
and computer robotics. But one of the most interesting effects in
the show is a simple piece of theatrics. When the witch melts, she
flattens herself down a staircase, unseeen by the audience.
   Bill Campbell's costumes are a whimsical treat, especially the
ornate Munchkin attire. The Yellow Brick Road, though, is a
disappointment. It's difficult to see, and just sort of pops up
every now and then. Dorothy and crew half-heartedly trot along.

   The Federal Aviation Administration has warned U.S.
airlines of a possible hijack attempt by Palestinian terrorists in
Europe, the U.S. Embassy and the FAA said today.
   But officials at the U.S. Embassy in London, the FAA and the
White House denied a report today in the tabloid Daily Express that
U.S. diplomats and military personnel had been notified of the
warning. They also denied that the warning said the hijacking could
occur over Easter weekend.
   A spokesman for the U.S. European Command, which is in charge of
U.S. military forces in Europe, said it was aware of the warning but
did not pass it along to military personnel. The spokesman, Army
Maj. Dennis Pinkham, spoke with The Associated Press from Stuttgart
and refused to elaborate.
   The front-page Daily Express report came during a political
debate in Britain over whether airlines were properly informed about
a radio-cassette bomb before Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747 bound
for New York, was blown apart over Lockerbie in Scotland, Dec. 21,
killing 270 people.
   Airports in England, Italy, Belgium and West Germany stepped up
security after receiving the warning, but no additional precautions
were reported today at airports in the Netherlands, Greece or Spain.
   The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said today the
warning was issued March 16 and that it was ``similar to many, many
similar kinds of information and security bulletins that go out.''
   Fitzwater said in Washington that ``it was not given to any
military or diplomatic personnel but rather just to security experts
at aviation airports and airlines.'' The notice did not mention any
specific time period, such as Easter, Fitzwater said, nor did it
mention a specific airline or airport.
   The FAA said in a statement in Washington that the security
bulletin was issued to provide information to air carriers and
airports about ``the possibility of a hijacking of a U.S. airliner
in Western Europe.'' The FAA said the bulletin was sensitive
information not designed for public distribution.
   ``The release of this information by unauthorized persons can be
counterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts to
provide a totally effective security system,'' the FAA said.
   The FAA said the bulletin did not refer to a time period or name
an airline or airport, nor was there any reference to the Eastern
Holiday period. It said no warning was issued to U.S. government
employees.
   Richard Calder, a spokesman at the embassy press office in
London, said the FAA office in London passed on the warning to
Britain's Department of Transport and to U.S. carriers in Britain.
   In Bonn today, officials said the West German Interior Ministry
and U.S. government offices were notified of a threatened terrorist
attack but that they did not issue a warning to the public. Flight
103 originated in West Germany.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman, Roland Bachmeier, said Bonn
authorities received ``a vague warning'' that a hijack threat had
been made, but declined to give any details of the threat or how it
was received.
   In another development, Independent Television News today showed
videotape taken by three youths who said they were able to board an
empty British Airways jumbo jet at Heathrow on Monday without being
challenged. The video included a shot of one youth sitting in the
captain's seat in the cockpit.
   ``They say they are cracking down on security and they are
confident no one else can do what happened at Lockerbie,'' said one
of the youths, identified only as Shoaib Khan. ``It is just not
true.''
   British Airways said in a statement it regarded the incident as
``extremely serious'' and was investigating.
   The London tabloid the Daily Express said the possible hijack
threat was detailed in a secret memorandum dated March 17 from the
FAA. The paper said it had been given a copy of the memorandum.
   Britain's Department of Transport said in a statement: ``We don't
discuss security matters.''
   The Daily Express said:
   ``American military personnel and diplomats and their families
have been told of the threat, which centers on U.S. airlines. They
were advised to alter routine plans to return home from Europe for
Easter.''
   The Daily Express said the FAA memo ``warns all airlines and
security forces in the U.S., Britain and the rest of Europe. It was
passed to the Department of Transport in London'' It quotes
``security sources'' as saying a copy of the memo arrived at the
London offices of International Aviation Security, a company owned
by Trans World Airlines.''
   The Daily Express printed part of the memorandum, which read in
part:
   ``Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a U.S.
airliner in Europe. Possible names: Jamel Hahmud Talid Muhammed:
Ahmed Muhammad Salim Abuzayni: Khalour Muhammed Jafar.
   ``Alias passports: Bahrain, Pakistan, North Yemen, possible
genuine@forged or altered.
   ``Above information credible although not confirmed.'

   Patriarch Pimen, head of the Russian Orthodox
Church, won a seat in the new Soviet parliament, but Georgy Arbatov,
the Kremlin's longtime expert on the United States, lost in a
surprise defeat, Tass said Thursday.
   Under the new electoral law, 750 seats in the 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies have been allocated to public
organizations, such as trade unions, the Academy of Science and the
Communist Party.
   Patriarch Pimen and Arbatov, former head of the Institute of
American and Canadian Studies, were among six nominees put forth by
the Soviet Peace Committee in a contest for five allocated seats.
   The five Peace Committee members were elected Wednesday. National
voting to elect deputies for the remaining 1,500 seats will be held
Sunday.
   ``Surprisingly for many, chairman of the Soviet U.N. Association
Georgy Arbatov, who has for 20 years headed the academic Institute
of American and Canadian Studies in Moscow, failed to get a seat in
parliament,'' Tass said.
   At a Communist Party meeting in June, the 65-year-old Arbatov was
publicly criticized for being too old to function effectively. Also
criticized at that meeting were former Foreign Minister Andrei A.
Gromyko, 79, and Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 75, both of whom were
retired at a subsequent plenum in September.
   Of the six nominees, Patriarch Pimen won the most votes, Tass
said.
   Among other public organizations that chose members of parliament
Wednesday and Thursday was the Komsomol, the party's youth
organization, Tass said. It filled its 75 seats with 64 men and 11
women.
   The Central Council of Trade Unions, representing 142 million
trade unionists, chose 100 deputies for its allocated seats from
among 114 nominees, Tass said.
   Other groups voting for deputies included the Union of Filmmakers
and the Consumer Cooperative Societies.
   The new Congress of People's Deputies will meet once a year and
will elect a smaller Supreme Soviet from within its ranks that will
sit about eight months a year and function as a full-time
legislative body.

   A young mother used her 3-year-old son
to help burglarize homes, authorities said.
   Michelle Danser, 20, of Browns Mills was charged with burglary,
theft and endangering the welfare of a child. She was arraigned in
Superior Court Wednesday and was jailed under $10,000 bond,
authorities said.
   Police said Ms. Danser, who was unemployed, lifted her toddler
into the windows of at least four of the eight houses she
burglarized to open a door for her.
   ``Sometimes she would let him play in the yard while she was
burglarizing the house,'' said Pemberton Township Police Lt. Paul
Tuliano. ``He didn't know what was going on.''
   The state's Division of Youth and Family Services gave custody of
the boy to his maternal grandparents.

   The Navy believes it obtained enough radio
telemetry from this week's failed Trident 2 missile launch to
determine the precise cause, but already suspects a fault in the
rocket nozzle system of the first stage motor, the Pentagon's chief
spokesman said Thursday.
   Dan Howard, the spokesman, said a preliminary investigation
suggests either an electrical or mechanical glitch in the part of
the missile that swivels the rocket nozzles from side to side.
   ``And we do believe that we have the necessary data to be able to
evaluate it and pinpoint the problem, even without the recovery of
the vehicle,'' Howard said.
   ``We do have further launches scheduled. At this point, there are
no plans to delay or alter that planned launch program. And we still
expect that the Trident 2 will be fully operational aboard the USS
Tennessee in December.''
   The investigation began Tuesday, shortly after a Trident 2
missile fired from the submarine Tennessee self-destructed four
seconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface as planned
and the first stage ignited properly, but the missile then began
spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded.
   It was the first submarine launch of the Navy's newest and most
powerful weapon.
   According to Howard, the missile's first-stage rocket nozzles are
supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the weapon on a
19-degree angle of flight. Another internal command is then sent to
the nozzles to straighten back up, thus maintaining the missile's
19-degree angle.
   In this case, the spokesman, the radio telemetry discloses the
second command to the nozzles to straighten was sent but not
executed.
   ``They do not know yet whether the difficulty is in the
electrical system, that that signal did not get from the sending
point to the receiving point, or if the difficulty was simply
mechanical, that a pump didn't operate correctly or whatever,'' he
continued.
   ``In any event, (the nozzles) did not correct. So the missile
continued in that pitchover maneuver, round and round in circles.
And as it did so, it generated G-forces internal to the missile,''
triggering a self-destruct safety system, he said.
   Howard declined to predict how long it would take technicians to
isolate the cause of the failure.
   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon
that is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident
1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to
individual targets up to 6,000 miles away.
   The Trident 1 experienced similar test failures but still was
deployed on schedule, Howard noted Thursday. After 19 test launches,
the Trident 1 had worked only 13 times compared to 16 for the
Trident 2, he said.
   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its
undersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and can
match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it is
launched from a submerged, moving submarine.
   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry
24 of the deadly missiles.

   Two of the nation's moonwalkers, Edwin ``Buzz''
Aldrin and Eugene Andrew Cernan, say it's time for the United States
to step up its commitment to space.
   Aldrin, the second man to step foot on the moon, and Cernan, the
last, spoke Wednesday at a tennis tournament celebration at the
Doral Resort and Country Club.
   The space program has been rudderless since the Apollo missions,
Aldrin said. He called on the Bush administration to create a space
program with a clear objective, not just a series of space shuttle
launches with no unifying long-term goal.
   ``I would like to see a renewed commitment to exploration,'' said
Aldrin, who walked on the moon on July 20, 1969, after Neil
Armstrong. The two astronauts flew on the Apollo 11 mission.
   Cernan, who walked on the moon in the Apollo 17 mission in
December 1972, said he thought his steps would signify the beginning
of a new era and not the end of a mission.
   ``I'm disappointed that that new era has not materialized,''
Cernan said. ``We don't have a basic mission ... there's no plan.''

   Actress Beverly Todd was embraced by the
parents of a teen-ager who is accused of killing her son, Malik
Smith, in a bar fight.
   John Tavo Leota, 18, was arraigned on the second-degree murder
charge Wednesday in a five-minute hearing attended by Todd.
   Leota remained in jail after the judge scheduled an April 5
preliminary hearing and refused to reduce the $100,000 bail. A
prosecutor argued that as a juvenile Leota was involved in several
similar incidents.
   After the arraignment, Todd left the courtroom weeping quietly
and the defendant's father, John Leota Sr., embraced her and said,
``I'm very sorry.''
   His wife, Elvina Leota, embraced Todd and told reporters she
empathized with the actress.
   ``I know how she feels. I think I feel the same feeling. I hope
she understands,'' Mrs. Leota said. ``I know my son very well. He's
not that kind of boy. He is a child with a lot of problems.''
   Smith, 18, of Los Angeles, was skiing in Utah. He died Monday at
the University of Utah Health Sciences Center after he was struck
during a fight at a disco late Saturday, said West Valley City
Police Sgt. Thayle Nielsen.
   Todd learned of the death in New York, where she was promoting
the film ``Lean on Me,'' in which she portrays an assistant
principal. She has appeared in ``Clara's Heart,'' ``Moving,'' ``Baby
Boom'' and ``Roots.''

   Italian architect Renzo Piano, widely known for his
work on the futuristic Pompidou Cultural Center in Paris, was
awarded Britain's Royal Gold Medal for Architecture.
   ``He has shown himself to be one of the outstanding architects of
the late 20th century. His work manages to combine a sense of wonder
and drama without ever losing its human scale and he is a community
architect of international reputation,'' said Rod Hackney, president
of the Royal Institute of British Architects which made the award
Wednesday.
   Piano's designs for Kansai Airport in Japan and the subway in
Genoa, Italy, ``renew the feeling of adventure and excitement that
men and women have long felt for travel,'' Hackney said.
   The gold medal was first awarded in 1848 and is considered the
world's single most prestigious honor in architecture.
   An exhibition of Piano's work will be held in London April 21-May
23.

   Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei
Sakharov will attend an international symposium to be held in the
Danish capital May 18-19, the Politiken newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The symposium, called ``Global Tasks in an Open World:
Confrontation to Cooperation,'' is sponsored by the Niels Bohr
Institute of Copenhagen University and The American Academy of Arts.
   About 80 delegates from Japan, Africa, India, United States and
Europe are expected to attend.
   ``This confirms the contention that there is a spiritual
connection between Niels Bohr's idea about an open world and
Sakharov's ideas,'' university Chancellor Ove Nathan was quoted as
saying.
   Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist who laid the groundwork for the
theory of quantum mechanics in the 1940s, and called for the free
dissemination of scientific information.

<HEAD>Survivors: 130 Vietnamese Killed When Boat Sinks Near Malaysia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese refugees said Thursday about 130
countrymen drowned two weeks ago when their overloaded 30-foot
wooden boat capsized and sank near a Japanese tanker in the South
China Sea.
   Japanese authorities said first reports of the March 8 accident
did not emerge until Monday, when 35 survivors of the accident on
the high seas between Vietnam and Malaysia arrived in the port of
Yokohama. News agencies in Malaysia said Thursday that floating
bodies were sighted off Malaysia.
   It was the latest reported accident involving the increasing
number of Vietnamese fleeing political repression and economic
hardship in the communist country. The refugees, known as boat
people, risk piracy and disaster in hopes of achieving asylum and
permanent resettlement outside Vietnam.
   Surviving refugees said the boat collided with the 239,000-ton
Nissei-Maru and sank, but the tanker's captain said he believed a
wave capsized the boat.
   Survivors said their boat was carrying 165 people. A Nagasaki
refugee center official, Masanami Nakatsukasa, said the boat had
left Long An in southern Vietnam on March 4.
   Many passengers were seasick and were suffering from a lack of
fresh water after four days at sea, and they had been trying to
approach the tanker for help, the official quoted survivors as
saying.
   ``The tanker came very close to our boat, and the waves pushed us
into the ship,'' survivor Chan Kin Kan told the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. late Thursday.
   ``Our boat capsized. The children and others trapped in the boat
were drowned,'' Chan said.
   The boat overturned and sank after hitting the propeller at the
back of the Nissei-Maru, the refugee official quoted survivors as
saying.
   The tanker captain, Yasuo Kawamura, had stopped and prepared
ladders to take the refugees on board. He said in a TV interview
that the reason for the sinking was unclear.
   ``I couldn't see it with my own eyes, but we were completely
stopped, so I don't think we hit the boat,'' Kawamura said. ``I
think their boat was capsized when it was hit broadside by a wave.''
   Hiroshi Hattori, spokesman for Tokyo Tanker, the Nissei-Maru's
agent, also denied reports of a collision. He said the tanker crew
did not know how many refugees were missing after the accident.
   Reports that 165 refugees had been crammed into the boat were
``unbelievable,'' said Seichiro Okamoto, head of ocean operations
for Tokyo Tanker.
   The Nissei-Maru conducted an all-day search and rescued 35
refugees, then sailed for Singapore, where the refugees were refused
entry, news reports said.
   The refugees were brought to Yokohama on another Japanese vessel
after Japan granted them entry, said Chikako Saito, spokeswoman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Tokyo.
   Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Kazuhiro Numata said Tokyo
Tanker had not mentioned any missing, reporting only the rescue of
35 refugees.
   The agency, Japan's coast guard, will send officials to the
refugee center where the 35 survivors are staying to investigate the
accident, Numata said.
   Saito said the refugees will become Japanese residents unless
they have close relatives in third countries.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said his ministry
viewed the case as ``a really serious issue,'' but could not comment
until the coast guard completed its investigation.
   In Malaysia, decomposed bodies sighted by fishermen in the seas
off northeast Malaysia were believed to be those of the refugees,
police said.
   The body of a girl found on a northeast Malaysian beach Tuesday
also is believed to be one of the drowned refugees, Trengganu state
Police Chief Wan Razak Muda told the national news agency Bernama.
   There are 16,500 Vietnamese refugees in Malaysian camps, more
than 750 who arrived since March 14, Bernama said.
   Last year, more than 45,000 boat people landed in Southeast Asian
countries, compared with fewer than 30,000 in 1987.
   Under a new policy by the Association of Southern Asian nations,
recently arrived boat people will be put into temporary camps and
screened to determine if they are genuine refugees fleeing for
political purposes or just economic refugees seeking a better life
in the West.
   The economic refugees are returned to Vietnam. So far no one has
been deported from Malaysia.
   U.N. officials also are trying to stem to exodus. They plan to
stress the advantages of the 10-year-old ``Orderly Departure
Program,'' under which 23,000 people were flown from Vietnam last
year, most for resettlement in the United States and Australia.

<HEAD>Deng Xiaoping Says He Skipped Session Due to Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said Thursday that he
skipped the opening session of China's legislature so he could
``conserve my health and live longer.
   In his first public appearance since the National People's
Congress opened Monday, he also acknowledged the government has made
mistakes, such as not paying enough attention to education and
forgetting its tradition of hard work and plain living.
   ``I seldom do the daily work (of government) now,'' Deng told
visiting Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
   Deng, 84, did not attend even though he is a delegate to the
congress from his home province, Sichuan. Government officials said
only that Deng had asked for leave.
   Deng confirmed to Museveni: ``I have asked for leave. I want to
conserve my health and live longer. What is more important is that I
should gradually withdraw from the stage and let others preside over
the work.''
   He noted new government and party leaders were chosen in 1987 and
1988. Deng retired from all his posts except that of chairman of the
Central Military Commission, which sets military policy.
   ``We should not let the new leaders feel that there is a kind of
force above them,'' Deng said.
   ``Yes, but young people need the guidance and leadership of the
older generation,'' Museveni responded.
   In a later report by the official Xinhua News Agency, Deng was
quoted as saying the government has made small mistakes in the last
10 years during which China has enacted a reform program to open its
economy to market forces.
   China is facing an inflation rate of 36 percent, the highest
since the communist victory in 1949. Corruption also is on the rise.
Deng said it would take the country two to four years to overcome
the problems.
   Deng said Premier Li Peng had referred to the mistakes in his
report Monday to the National People's Congress.
   ``Foreigners have commented that we have made self-criticisms
about these mistakes. We veterans, too have to take
responsibility,'' he said.
   Deng chain smokes despite doctors' advice to cut down. He wears a
hearing aid in one ear and moves more slowly than he did several
years ago, but is not known to have any major ailment.
   He has cut down sharply on his public appearances in the past
year, but is still believed to play a deciding role in policymaking
and apparently is the final voice when party leader Zhao Ziyang, Li
and other officials disagree.
   Some Western experts believe he is the only leader with the full
support of the military.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested about 80 anti-abortion
protesters today at a clinic, the first target of an Easter season
offensive undertaken with a blessing from the head of the nation's
biggest Roman Catholic archdiocese.
   Some 400 members of Operation Rescue sang ``Jesus loves the
little children, all little children of the world,'' as the
protesters were dragged away from the Family Planning Associates
Medical Group clinic in Cypress, 20 miles from Los Angeles.
   The arrests brought cheers from about 150 counter-demonstrators,
who had chanted: ``Not the church, not the state, women will decide
our fate.''
   ``This is too big to ignore. We need to do something for our
voices to be heard,'' said Sue Otti, one of the pro-choice advocates.
   The anti-abortion protesters went limp as police in helmets and
face shields carried them away. Others crawled up to the clinic on
hands and knees to continue the blockades. They, too, were carried
off by police.
   Those arrested were taken on buses to the Orange County jail,
where they were to be issued misdemeanor citations for failing to
disperse, said sheriff's Lt. Dick Olson.
   Operation Rescue said it expected up to 2,500 people to protest
today at targeted clinics, with most willing to risk jail by
ignoring a federal court order against blocking entrances. The New
York-based group says 21,000 of its anti-abortion advocates have
been arrested in nationwide protests since 1987.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony lent his prayers to the demonstrators in
a statement issued Wednesday.
   ``I understand and respect the goals of Operation Rescue,
appreciate the manifestation by its participants of the value of
human life and the need to take active steps to safeguard each human
life from the moment of conception,'' he said. ``I offer my prayers
for those who choose to participate.''
   Pro-choice advocates, describing the demonstrators as bullies,
vowed the clinics would remain open throughout protests.
   Los Angeles officials, promising to enforce laws to keep the
clinics open, set up a command center four floors under City Hall,
just as they do to mobilize forces during earthquakes.
   Organizers of the protests Wednesday displayed what they said was
a human fetus in a small, white coffin at a news conference.
   ``This is `Baby Choice,''' said Randall Terry, founder of
Operation Rescue. ``She was killed at 19 weeks by a saline solution
abortion, and she will answer all your questions.'' Terry left
quickly, refusing to answer further questions.
   The archbishop ``has no comment on the tactics involved,'' said
Bill Rivera, a spokesman for the archdiocese, when asked about the
coffin display.
   One local anti-abortion group, the Right to Life League of
Southern California, declined to take part in the protests because
of the court order won March 13 by the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California.
   ``My heart is with these people, but I choose to operate within
the law,'' said president Susan Carpenter-McMillan.

<HEAD>Army Reports More than 600 Casualties In Tibet Clashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top army officer in Tibet said Thursday more
than 600 casualties have resulted from 21 riots in Lhasa in the past
18 months, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Both the casualty figure and the number of clashes exceeded
levels previously acknowledged by authorities who for months sought
to minimize the degree of violence in the remote region.
   Since the latest clash March 5, however, the government has
stressed the violence of anti-Chinese protesters in its efforts to
portray the clashes as the result of outside plotting.
   ``These riots, all organized, have been escalating in scale with
a rising toll of life and property,'' Xinhua quoted Maj. Gen. Zhang
Shaosong, political commissar of the Tibet military region, as
saying. It said Zhang was in Beijing as a delegate to the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, which is holding its annual
meeting.
   He did not say how many dead and wounded his casualty figure
represented, nor did he give details of the 21 incidents.
   Casualties are known to have occurred only in four confrontations
between Chinese security forces and Tibetan nationalists, beginning
with a mob attack on a police station Oct. 1, 1987.
   Official reports on those clashes have listed 24 dead and more
than 432 wounded. Unofficial estimates by Tibetans have said at
least 70 people died in the four clashes.
   About a dozen smaller, non-violent protests by Tibetans also have
been reported by foreign travelers to the region, resulting in
arrests but no violence that could be described as a ``riot.''
   Xinhua quoted Zhang as saying that martial law imposed on Lhasa
on March 8 ``has punctured the reactionary activities of separatists
and won support from the whole nation, Tibetans included.''
   Xinhua has carried many articles recently quoting delegates to
the National People's Congress as supporting martial law and
condemning Tibetan pro-independence demonstrators.
   Foreign reporters have not been allowed to interview Tibetan
delegates.
   Lhasa and nearby counties remain closed to foreign travelers
under the martial law. No date for lifting martial law has been
specified despite official reports from Lhasa that life has
``returned to normal.''
   China says it has ruled Tibet for more than seven centuries. Many
Tibetans say they actually were independent for much of that time,
ruled by a Buddhist theocracy headed by the Dalai Lama. Those taking
part in the anti-Chinese protests say they want the Dalai Lama to
return, ending his 30-year exile in India.

   A man with an automatic weapon today
killed a mother and daughter after taking the younger woman hostage,
then sexually assaulted a third woman and fled a traffic accident on
foot, authorities said.
   About 100 law enforcement officers hunted for the man in a
suburban Denver area of housing tracts cut by creeks and grassy
floodplains. Helicopters helped look for the killer.
   The man was last seen wearing a cowboy hat, blue jeans and cowboy
boots, and was believed armed with either an Uzi or a MAC-10
submachine gun, said Sheriff Steve Zotos.
   ``He's extremely dangerous,'' said Sheriff's Lt. Bill Walker.
``We have four or five crime scenes and a lot of people hurt and
injured.''
   Authorities withheld the names of the shooting victims.
   Zotos said the episode began southwest of Denver when a woman
phoned an emergency number about 3 a.m. to report a burglary but
hung up before sheriff's deputies could ask her questions.
Authorities traced the call and discovered the woman and her car
missing from her home.
   Shortly after 6 a.m., the Louviers Fire Department got a report
of shootings in a subdivision. Zotos said the gunman had taken his
hostage to her mother's home in the subdivision and shot both women.
   The sheriff said one of two men in the home at the time initially
was thought to be wounded but was only covered with blood and not
harmed.
   About 8 a.m., the gunman went to a home in another subdivision,
sexually assaulted a woman there and also terrorized a man and
child, holding them at gunpoint, authorities said.
   After the man fled, police learned about the traffic accident
involving a vehicle matching the car the gunman was thought to be
driving. Based on the damage to the car, authorities believed the
man was injured in the accident.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Hopeful of Accord When Talks Resume in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget talks between the White House and
Congress will continue into April as negotiators remain hopeful of
accord despite the slow pace of the talks, according to a statement
released Thursday.
   The secret sessions involving President Bush's aides and the
leaders of the House and Senate budget committees broke off
Wednesday until Congress returns next month from its Easter recess.
   The bargaining group released a letter Thursday, reporting to the
president and the congressional leadership that they believed their
talks may eventually bear fruit, a deficit-reduction plan for the
fiscal 1990 budget.
   The letter said the meetings have been ``cordial and
constructive'' and added: ``A number of budget options have been
discussed. We intend to continue to negotiate on the basis of these
and other options in an effort to reach a compromise.''
   The goal of the group is to agree on a plan for the $1.16
trillion budget that would meet the guidelines of the Gramm-Rudman
law, which calls for reducing the federal deficit to $100 billion in
fiscal 1990. The current year's deficit is expected to exceed $160
billion.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, one of the White House
negotiators, predicted Thursday a bipartisan agreement could be
negotiated which would not violate Bush's no-tax pledge.
   Bush proposed in his budget raising government revenues by about
$14 billion through a combination of tax increases, user fees, and
sales of government assets. However, the administration contends
none are ``new taxes.''
   In an appearance before the National Association of
Manufacturers, Brady also defended the economic assumptions
underlying the administration's budget. The forecast has been
attacked for using overly optimistic assumptions about economic
growth and interest rates.
   He said that a credible budget deficit reduction plan would lower
interest rates and the administration's growth forecast for 1989 and
1990 of 3.2 percent, as measured by the gross national product,
reflected the average growth rate of the economy over the past
several years.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,
said recent government reports indicating a possible return of
inflation ``haunt the negotiations'' and has helped spur the
negotiators toward creation of a substantive proposal.
   ``While it began with everybody thinking they really could slide
by'' with a minimal plan this year, the economic news has created
``a face-to-face confrontation with reality.''
   Panetta said Democrats were not going to propose raising taxes
any more than Bush. But he said one of his goals in the talks was to
make sure the $14 billion in revenue would actually be raised, and
that it was not a figure based on unrealistic expectations.
   A third of Bush's total is his estimate for revenue raised by
lowering the tax rate on capital gains, a proposal given little
chance on Capitol Hill.
   The talks are expected to resume April 3.
   Congress has an April 15 deadline for completing its annual
budget resolution, and it is unlikely a pact could be reached before
then. Congressional leaders have indicated the deadline could slip
somewhat.

<TEXT>
   Young men who boarded a jumbo jet at Heathrow
Airport and got into the cockpit said the caper proved the security
has not improved since a bomb brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland.
   British Airways said it considered the breach to be extremely
serious, but stressed that the Boeing 747 was in a maintenance area
and was not operational.
   A videotape taken by three young men who said they boarded the
aircraft early Monday was shown Thursday by Independent Television
News.
   ``They say they are cracking down on security and they are
confident no-one else can do what happened at Lockerbie,'' said
Shoaib Khan, the only one of the three who was identified. ``It is
just not true.
   ``We want to prove the point and just want to tell the whole
world that they are not doing anything about it,'' he said. ``We did
break the law and we are ready to stand up and say it was us who did
it and this is the reason why we did it.''
   Airport security has been a sensitive issue since the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103, which was blown apart Dec. 21 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people.
   The British Airways jet boarded by the young men reportedly was
at the airline's maintenance base adjoining Heathrow.
   The Transport Department said it was ``most concerned'' and had
asked British Airways for a report.
   ``It seems that the incident took place in the BA maintenance
area, which is BA's private property and outside the restricted area
of the airport on Monday morning,'' the department said.
   British Airways has its own security, but the young men said they
were not detected.
   John Prescott, the opposition Labor Party's transportation
spokesman, said the incident was a ``clear breach of security'' and
said in the House of Commons he wanted an explanation from Transport
Minister Paul Channon.
   ``He assured us in this House less than 70 hours ago that
security at Heathrow is OK,'' said Prescott. ``It is not, and the
traveling public are absolutely concerned about it.''
   Robert Adley, a lawmaker from the governing Conservative Party,
called for prosecution of the three.
   ``People who trespass, for whatever reason, are behaving as
irresponsibly as people who make hoax telephone calls, and should be
treated as such,'' Adley said.
   A spokesman for Scotland Yard said detectives would interview the
young men, but added there appeared to be no crime involved.

   Rubella has almost vanished in the United States
since a vaccine was licensed 20 years ago, but federal health
officials said Thursday they are concerned that a large number of
the remaining cases are occurring among adults.
   Preliminary figures released Thursday by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control showed there were 221 cases of rubella, also known
as German measles, reported in 1988. A final count for 1987
indicated there were 306 cases of rubella, the CDC said.
   The 1988 figure amounted to about one case per 1 million people
and represented the lowest total since 1966, when the government
began compiling statistics on the disease. It was a 99 percent drop
from 1969, when the vaccine was licensed.
   The disease is fairly mild in most people, but it can cause
serious birth defects such as heart disease and mental retardation
in babies whose mothers are infected while pregnant. Because of
this, health officials are most worried about the risk of infection
to women of childbearing age.
   The CDC said its preliminary figures indicate there was just one
case reported last year of a baby born with signs of rubella
infection or related birth defects, down from three in 1987. But so
far this year, there have been three more cases reported of babies
with rubella or related problems.
   In 1980, the federal Public Health Service set a goal cutting the
number of overall cases to 1,000 by 1990, and the number of cases
among newborns to fewer than 10.
   Although both goals were reached years ahead of time,
``unacceptable morbidity is still occurring,'' the CDC said in its
weekly report.
   The CDC said people 15 and over accounted for 58.2 percent of all
U.S. rubella cases in 1985-87. Nationwide statistics from before the
rubella vaccine was licensed are not broken down by age group, the
CDC said, but data from areas that did count rubella cases by age
group during that time indicated that only about 23 percent of all
cases were in people 15 and over in 1966-68.
   ``The continued occurrence of rubella in childbearing-aged
populations suggests that potentially preventable cases of
congenital rubella syndrome may continue to occur during the next 10
to 30 years,'' the CDC said in its weekly report.
   Dr. Paul A. Stehr-Green, an epidemiologist with the Atlanta-based
CDC, said that during the last major rubella epidemic, in 1962-64,
there were 12.5 million cases reported in the United States,
including 20,000 babies born with the disease and 11,000 fetal
deaths.
   Stehr-Green said most of the rubella cases occurring now stem
from people failing to get vaccinated, though there are some cases
of the vaccine failing to work.
   ``This is more an issue of failure to vaccinate rather than a
failure of the vaccine,'' he said.
   The government recommends that children get rubella vaccine when
they are 15 months old. Stehr-Green said adults who have not had the
disease and are not sure if they've been vaccinated are advised to
get the shot again.

   South Carolina's Roman Catholic bishop
has banned bingo in his diocese because he considers the game an
unseemly way of raising money.
   ``This is an evil in the country,'' Bishop Ernest Unterkoefler
said Wednesday. ``People think they are getting something for
nothing ... and we are aiding and abetting something that is not
good for society.
   ``I'm not saying gambling is sinful, but I am saying that under
state and church auspices, it is no way to raise money,'' he said.
   Instead, money should be raised by ``sacrificial giving'' by
churchgoers, the bishop said.
   The diocese, which covers the entire state, has 100,000
parishioners in about 100 parishes and missions. The directive
issued last week is one of the first such measures in the country,
said John Conick, a permanent deacon.
   The diocese could not say how many institutions would be affected
and how much revenue they would lose, but Cardinal Newman High
School in Columbia raises $70,000 through bingo games it must end by
July 1990.
   Bingo is legal in South Carolina if it is for the benefit of
charitable, religious or fraternal organizations. But state records
show that big-time promoters have found ways to get around the law
and keep most of the proceeds.

   Two Soviet aircraft landed in Namibia on
Thursday for the first time, carrying Finnish troops and crates of
equipment for the U.N. peacekeeping force monitoring the territory's
transition to independence.
   A delegation of U.N. officials were at the Windhoek airport for
the arrival of the Aeroflot cargo plane, and a second plane bringing
the Finnish soldiers.
   In Walvis Bay, meanwhile, a ceremony was held to receive 167
Volkswagen vehicles sent by ship from West Germany for use by the

   Implementation of the United Nations' independence plan for
Namibia starts April 1, but about 600 U.N. personnel from 43
countries already have arrived, including about 100 civilians and
500 soldiers.
   The main contingents of the 4,650-member military force are to
arrive by ship next month.
   South Africa has pledged to withdraw its troops from the
territory it has ruled for 73 years, allowing multiracial,
U.N.-supervised elections in November for a constituent assembly
which will draw up a constitution.
   U.N. official Abdu Ciss said the scheduled arrival of about 1,000
U.N. civilian personnel may have to be slowed down because of the
scarcity of accomodations in Windhoek. Up to four U.N. personnel
have been sharing hotel rooms in the city, he said, and the U.N. is
buying prefabricated housing.

<HEAD>House Passes Minimum Wage Bill After Rejecting Bush Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation today to raise the
hourly minimum wage to $4.55 after rejecting President Bush's more
modest offer of an increase to $4.25, sending the partisan battle to
the Senate for another round next month.
   The vote was 248-171.
   ``It isn't enough but it certainly is better than nothing,''
House Speaker Jim Wright said of the legislation during a floor
speech in favor of the Democrats' bill.
   Passage came after a 240-179 vote to amend the legislation to set
the final level of the minimum wage at $4.55 an hour and add a
provision allowing employers to pay new entrants in the job market a
sub-minimum wage for two months.
   Earlier, Bush's proposal, offered by Republicans as a substitute
to the Democrats' bill, was defeated 218-198, with more than 40
Democrats joining the GOP effort.
   ``I see no defensible argument to say that is adequate,'' Rep.
Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said of Bush's offer of a 1992 hourly
minimum wage of $4.25.
   Hawkins was the sponsor of the Democratic bill, which originally
called for the minimum wage to rise to $4.65 an hour by 1992. But he
supported the amendment rolling back the final target by a dime
while at the same time moving the effective dates of the increases
forward, each by three months.
   Under the amendment, the first increase, from the current $3.35
an hour to $3.85, would take effect Oct. 1.
   Hawkins and other Democratic sponsors of the measure are staunch
opponents of the so-called training wage contained in the amendment
that allows some new hires to be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage
for 60 days.
   However, they reluctantly agreed to add it to the bill to win the
support of enough moderate-to-conservative Democrats, particularly
from Southern states, to keep them from defecting to the Republican
effort to substitute Bush's proposal Hawkins' bill.
   Forty-three Democrats defected nonetheless, while 16 Republicans
voted against the Bush offer.
   ``We need an increase in the minimum wage, but we do not need the
job loss and the inflation that sometime accompany excessive
increased in the minimum wage,'' Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., said in
joining the Republicans.
   The Democratic-backed amendment was expected to pass before the
House voted later today on the legislation itself, the final order
of business before a week-long Easter recess. The Senate, already in
recess, is to take up a similar minimum-wage bill in early April.
   The House considered the amendments today after spending several
hours Wednesday engaged in a largely partisan debate, with
supporters arguing that a pay raise was needed for the working poor
was long overdue and opponents saying too big of a boost would hurt
those it is designed to help.
   ``We are not arguing against an increase in the minimum wage, our
concern is the size of the increase,'' said Rep. William Goodling,
R-Pa.
   Bush has insisted his offer is his last and appears to have the
votes to sustain a veto.
   Democrats supporting the bill, however, said the changes they
would make through the amendment today represent considerable
concessions and called on the president to compromise as well.
Joining that effort was a Republican congressman who helped draft
the amendment, Rep. Thomas J. Ridge of Pennsylvania.
   ``Inflexibility will not serve the interest of the minimum wage
worker,'' said Ridge.
   Several Democrats asserted they had compromised too much already
and blamed Republicans for blocking attempts to raise the minimum,
which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981.
   ``We ought to be ashamed of having this long period of no
realization of the need to have an improvement in the minimum
wage,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.

<HEAD>U.S.-South Korean Forces End Team Spirit Exercises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200,000 U.S. and South Korean
troops ended joint military exercises Thursday, and a senior U.S.
commander said the annual maneuvers would help discourage aggression
by North Korea.
   Gen. Louis C. Menetrey said ``Team Spirit'' exercises were held
``solely to test and improve the capability of Korean and U.S.
military forces to deter war or defeat aggression on the Korean
peninsula.''
   Also Thursday, 13 U.S. Marines who were seriously injured in a
helicopter crash during the maneuvers left for the United States for
further medical treatment, a U.S. military spokesman said.
   Nineteen Marines were killed in the crash of a Sikorsky CH-53D
Sea Stallion helicopter on Monday near Pohang on the southeast
coast. Four others died in a separate crash March 17.
   Communist North Korea repeatedly demanded the exercises _ in
their 14th year _ be called off and claimed Team Spirit was a front
for U.S. war prepartions. Radical South Korean students have
protested the exercises, and opinion polls indicate many ordinary
South Koreans have a growing doubts about it.
   Menetrey said the exercises were necessary because North Korea
poses a major military threat to the south. He said the exercises
were purely defensive and North Korea's annual protests proved their
worth.
   ``The exercise threatens no one, North Korea or anyone else,''
Menetrey said. ``In fact, as an effective means to ensure our
defense readiness, Team Spirit is a major factor for peace.''
   The general expressed regret that North Korea had rejected an
invitation to send observers to Team Spirit to reassure the
Pyongyang government they posed no threat to the north.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are based in the South under a mutual
defense treaty, and they were joined during the exercises by 27,000
from Okinawa, Hawaii and the U.S. mainland.
   U.S. forces have been based in the South since Washington
intervened in 1950 to aid the Seoul government against the North
Korean invasion that started the Korean War. The two Koreas are
still technically at war.
   A U.S. military spokesman said two C-141 transport planes
carrying 13 injured Marines left a military base near Seoul to carry
the burn victims to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
   Two burn victims remained in good or fair condition at a Seoul
military hospital and were not evacuated to the United States, the
spokesman said.
   Monday's helicopter accident was still under investigation.

   The International Federation of
Journalists has protested the killing of three reporters in El
Salvador, urging a full investigation and measures to protect the
press.
   Salvadoran journalists Mauricio Pineda and Francisco Roberto
Navas and Dutch journalist Cornel Lagrouw were killed by Salvadoran
soldiers as they were covering the nation's elections Sunday.
   ``The people of your country will never be free, and your
democracy will never have substance until journalists can walk the
streets without fear,'' said Aidan White, secretary-general of the
federation. His the letter was released Thursday by the
Brussels-based organization.
   ``The killing of these journalists during a democratic election
is an outrage, not only to the profession of journalism but also to
democracy itself,'' White wrote to Salvadoran President Napoleon
Duarte and President-elect Alfredo Cristiani.
   ``We urge you to ensure that there is the fullest possible
investigation into each of the incidents,'' White added. ``This
inquiry should be immediate, should be thorough and should be
public.''
   ``The deaths come at a time when the democratic process is
gathering pace in your country and in other parts of Central
America,'' he added. ``But there is no democracy without human
rights and freedom of expression.
   ``Journalists, whose first duty is to serve the public interest,
are constantly under threat in the world today,'' White wrote.
``There are taken hostage in Beirut, they are detained without trial
in South Africa, they are brutally murdered in political struggles
in Peru or in the Philippines.
   ``I urge you to take urgent action to protect journalists in El
Salvador from further attacks,'' White told Duarte and Christiani.
   The federation represents more than 150,000 journalists worldwide.

<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As serious and solemn as religious
holidays can be, there is plenty of room for humor. Just ask Cal
Samra on ``Easter Monday.''
   That's the first day of the Holy Humor Season, a monthlong
celebration created by Samra's Fellowship of Merry Christians, a
Kalamazoo-based ecumenical group that believes there's a serious
lack of humor in faith.
   Between 100 and 200 churches in 24 states are expected to
celebrate Monday in their own funny way. Festivities, built around
the resurrection, will include sing-alongs and joke-tellings
sessions. The Merry Christians say raising Jesus from the dead was
the ultimate in practical jokes that God played on Satan.
   Samra, who says his 3-year-old group has 10,000 members, believes
humor and Christianity often are thought of as mutually exclusive.
   ``There are two traditions in Christianity: there's a lot of joy
and humor and there's also a tradition of solemnity. We felt things
had gotten out of balance and we thought we should focus on
Christian humor, Christian wit, Christian joy,'' Samra said.
   In his bimonthly publication ``The Joyful Noiseletter,'' Samra
relays references of joy from the New Testament as well as
religious-oriented anecdotes and jokes from the famous and
not-so-famous:
   ``The good Lord didn't create anything without a purpose, but the
fly comes close'' _ Mark Twain.
   ``Question: What do you get if you cross a praying mantis with a
termite? Answer: An insect that says grace before he eats your
house.''
   Samra figures that if he can bring an occasional chuckle _ or
even a grin _ to those he touches, he has served his purpose.
   His theory, which is shared by scholars and scientists, is that
humor is healing.
   Samra, who began collecting rare drawings that depict Jesus with
a smile, described his theory in a book, ``The Joyful Christ,''
published in 1986 by Harper &amp; Row.
   Herb True, an adjunct professor at the University of Notre Dame,
applauds Samra's work. He believes most members of the clergy would
be receptive to it.
   ``Comedy is meant to get laughs _ usually at someone else's
expense. But humor is a form of love. It's purpose is to lift the
load,'' said True, a psychologist who claims to have the nation's
only humor database.
   Samra said about half the fellowship's subscribers are members of
the clergy with nearly every denomination represented. Other members
are health professionals and humorists. Even clowns.
   But not everyone agrees that religion should be presented in a
lighthearted manner.
   ``There is a tiny minority out there who have difficulty with the
concept of the joyful Christ,'' Samra said.

<HEAD>Congress Urged to Narrow Insurance Industry's Exemptions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankers and consumer-advocacy groups urged
Congress on Thursday to narrow the insurance industry's exemptions
from antitrust laws.
   ``Consumers suspect they're not getting their money's worth from
insurers,'' said Philip S. Corwin of the American Bankers
Association.
   ``How could they,'' he said, ``when price collusion at the
wholesale level is permitted by the antitrust exemption; competition
at the retail level is inhibited by (state) anti-rebate laws; and
the potential market entrant with the greatest ability to provide
new underwriting capacity and more efficient distribution, the
banking industry, is barred at the door?''
   In testimony to the commerce, consumer protection and
competitiveness subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, Corwin endorsed in general terms a bill by the
subcommittee chairman, Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., to forbid some
collective activities that insurance companies may engage in under
their antitrust exemptions.
   Several insurance companies and trade groups argued against
Florio's bill, contending it would lead to a reduction in the number
of companies offering property and casualty insurance.
   Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., said he would ``not stand idly by'' if he
thought Congress would jeopardize the existence of any companies in
his home state.
   ``Evidence has not been forthcoming'' to justify a need to change
the present system, Ritter said.
   Peggy Miller of the Consumer Federation of America said ``this
legislation will not cure'' problems of high premium costs and
limited availability of auto, health and life insurance, but only
provide ``one critically needed step.''
   There is no federal regulation of insurance, which is left to the
states under a 1945 law.
   Florio's bill would forbid the sharing of information to
determine premiums or coverage areas, bar ``tie-in'' sales such as
requirements that motorists buy a homeowner's policy with their auto
policy, and ban ``any action to impair the availability or
affordability of insurance.'' Companies could still share loss and
reserve data.
   Craig A. Berrington, a lawyer for the American Insurance
Association representing member casualty and property insurers, said
the tie-in prohibition appeared so strict ``it would have prevented
the marketing of today's standard homeowner's policy ... (and) the
marketing of commercial multiperil policies. And it would prevent
innovation in the future.''
   However, Linda A. Lipsen, representing Consumers Union, said such
purchase requirements currently ``leave virtually no avenues for
redress.''
   ``If the only butcher in town conditioned the sale of deluxe
boneless chicken breasts on the purchase of soup bones, such conduct
might be subject to a substantial fine,'' she said.

   A millionaire with a hankering for Russian
pumpernickel has struck a deal with the Soviet Union to fly 2,000
loaves a week to New York consumers.
   ``I thought it was an interesting metaphor _ breaking bread with
the Russians; I call it peace bread,'' said Fred Kayden, 58, of
Harrison, who describes himself as a ``retired multimillionaire.''
   Kayden grew to love Russian bread during his business travels,
and always brought home a few loaves. ``It's like old-fashioned
bread, with no preservatives,'' he said.
   Two months ago, he began talks with Valery Saikin, chairman of
the Moscow city council, who arranged the venture with help from
Aeroflot and the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council.
   The bread will be served at the Waldorf-Astoria and New York
Hilton hotels, and sold at 15 Zaro's Bread Basket stores in the
metropolitan area at a price of $4 to $5 for a 2-pound loaf.
   ``The Russian bread has a slightly sour taste that you would find
in a traditional Jewish rye bread, but with even more flavor and
taste,'' said Stuart Zaro, president of Zaro's.
   ``It has a very good shelf life because it's very dense and
moist,'' said John Doherty, executive chef of the Waldorf.
   The officials sampled four varieties during a Waldorf taste-test
Wednesday: regular rye, Unzhensky, Darnitzky and Borodino _ the
latter a dark, slightly sweet bread, lightly laced with caraway
seeds, anise and coriander.
   They ordered 500 loaves of each, and will let the public decide
what kind to import in the future.

   Police launched an investigation Thursday after
Western journalists photographed plainclothes policemen who had
pasted press signs on their car to disguise their identity while
investigating Palestinians.
   The incident drew a formal complaint from the Foreign Press
Association in Israel, which said in a letter to the government that
such action places journalists ``at great personal risk'' and urged
authorities ``to cease such behavior immediately.''
   The army and other security agencies repeatedly have denied
rumors their agents pose as reporters to get into Arab areas to
watch suspects and make arrests.
   Journalists covering the 15-month Palestinian uprising have
expressed fears that such activity could endanger them if Arabs
became fearful of vehicles with press tags.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said there were two policemen
involved, ``but it was the idea of just one of them, his own
personal idea.''
   Police Commissioner David Krauss has called for an officer to be
appointed to investigate the matter, Sandori said.
   The policemen will remain on duty while the inquiry is made.
``The policeman did not break the law, but of course this is a case
of ethics,'' Sandori said.
   Among the journalists who saw the undercover policemen using a
car with a press sign was a crew from the London-based Visnews
television agency.
   Michael Sposito, the Visnews bureau chief in Israel, said a team
first noticed the car parked near one of the gates to Jerusalem's
Old City.
   ``It was a late-model Subaru, a rental car, with handwritten
press signs in the front and rear windows,'' Sposito said. ``Press
was written in English.''
   The crew became suspicious when it did not recognize the men in
the car and photographed them.
   About three hours later, Sposito said, Visnews photographed the
same two men arresting Palestinian women after a stone-throwing
incident in the Arab east Jerusalem neighborhood of Wadi Joz,
Sposito said.
   ``Both were armed with sidearms and had handcuffs,'' he said.
``One was talking on a police radio, and one was dragging a
Palestinian girl away after arresting her.''
   Eli Hershkowitz of the Zoom Photo Agency said he had seen the
rented Subaru twice with press tags.
   ``Yesterday, I saw it with handwritten signs that said `Press,'''
Hershkowitz said. ``Today I saw it in the morning with signs front
and back that said `Television.'''
   The statement issued by the press association for foreign
journalists quoted the Visnews description of the incident. It said:
``The Foreign Press Associated deplores such an impersonation of
journalists by the authorities as an act that places us at great
personal risk.
   ``We cannot accept such behavior. It conveys to those we are
trying to cover that we, the real journalists, may well be police
agents.''

<HEAD>Pope Washes Feet of Young Priests in Holy Thursday Ceremony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II knelt before 12 young priests and
washed their feet Thursday evening in a re-enactment of the Jesus
Christ's Last Supper with his apostles.
   Thousands of worshipers packed the vast, marble-columned Basilica
of St. John Lateran, which is considered the pope's special church
as bishop of Rome, for the solemn Holy Thursday ceremony.
   Earlier in the day, the pope led 1,200 clergymen in renewing
their priestly vows in a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
   The services marked the beginning of four of the most important
days in the Roman Catholic calendar, marking the crucifixion of
Jesus Christ and his resurrection on Easter Sunday.
   John Paul, wearing white robes trimmed with gold, washed the feet
of a dozen priests from different countries who are studying in
Rome, in a ritual symbolizing Jesus' humility before he was
crucified on Good Friday.
   The pope poured water from a golden urn onto the foot of each of
the priests, who were seated on a platform beneath the altar and
wore gold robes. The pope then wiped each foot with a white cloth
and gently kissed it.
   Three of the priests were from Taiwan, two were from Nigeria and
two from Zaire. The others were from Uganda, the Philippines, South
Korea, Vietnam and Italy.
   The pope then celebrated Mass and delivered a homily on the
subject of Christian unity and reconciliation between people of
different countries and classes.
   ``All of us, who share the bread of the Eucharist, open ourselves
toward our brothers in the exercise of an authentic charity that
finds its realization in the family, in the professional world, in
schools, in the community and in society,'' he said.
   Catholics mark the Last Supper as the gathering at which Christ
instituted the Mass, the sacrament of the priesthood, and the
Eucharist _ the transformation of bread and wine into his body and
blood.
   On Friday, the pope will carry a wooden cross in a Good Friday
procession near the Colosseum. He will celebrate the Easter vigil on
Saturday night followed on Easter Sunday by a Mass in St. Peter's
Square.
   During the Mass on Thursday, the John Paul blessed the holy oils
used at baptisms, confirmations and the consecrations of bishops.
   Twenty-four cardinals, 50 bishops and 1,200 priests took part in
the service before about 10,000 people.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced Thursday he will
nominate Walter J.P. Curley, a New York investment banker and former
ambassador to Ireland, to be ambassador to France.
   Curley, who would succeed Joe M. Rodgers, was active in Bush's
1980 and 1988 presidential campaigns, serving as chairman of his New
York fund-raising committee.
   Since 1977, Curley has been with W.J.P. Curley Venture Capital in
New York City. He was ambassador to Ireland during the Ford
administration.
   Curley, 66, is also a former commissioner of public events for
New York City.

<HEAD>Uganda's Lakwena in Kenya, Not at Riotous Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ugandan warrior-priestess Alice Lakwena did
not flee a rioting refugee camp in central Kenya earlier this week
because she was never there, a U.N. official said Thursday.
   ``She has been in Kenya, but she wasn't in a camp,'' said Ernest
Allison, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees official in Nairobi.
``After her release from prison, she was placed in what was
considered a safe hideout. The government of Kenya knew where she
was and we knew where she was.''
   Allison would not say where that ``hideout'' was, whether Ms.
Lakwena still was there, or what she was doing. He said she had not
been placed in a group.
   Allison said that since early 1988 when Ms. Lakwena finished a
four-month jail sentence for entering Kenya illegally, she has been
under U.N. auspices while her application for asylum is under
consideration.
   ``The application is still being processed,'' said Allison. ``It
has neither been approved nor rejected.''
   A local newspaper Tuesday reported Ms. Lakwena was among more
than 100 refugees who fled from a U.N. camp in Thika, 27 miles north
of Nairobi, on Monday after rioting refugees damaged a car, broke
doors and beat up a storekeeper.
   Ms. Lakwena, 28, who called herself a medium of God, fled to
Kenya in December 1987 after Ugandan government forces defeated her
yearlong suicidal crusade to wrest power from President Yoweri
Museveni.
   Her forces were battalions of believers she inspired to go into
battle singing hymns, their chests smeared with oil they believed
would repel bullets and armed with stones she said would explode
like grenades.
   Thousands of her followers died before Museveni's army crushed
her campaign.
   Museveni's government has not asked for Ms. Lakwena's
extradition, according to O. Adala, head of the Africa division in
Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
   However, Allison said he could not elaborate in detail on Ms.
Lakwena's circumstances because of the ``nature of the case'' and
Uganda's interest in it.

<HEAD>Congress May Cut Proposed $1 Million-a-Day Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress will consider reducing the $1
million-a-day fines proposed by President Bush as part of a
crackdown on fraud in the savings and loan industry, a House
subcommittee chairman said Thursday.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the Judiciary
subcommittee on criminal justice, said in an interview that he
supported stiffer fines, but added, ``We have to discuss how much to
raise them.''
   Bush is proposing an increase from $1,000 to $25,000 a day for
most violations of banking regulations but up to $1 million daily if
the violation was made with reckless disregard for the safety of the
institution.
   Edward L. Yingling, executive director of government relations
for the American Bankers Association, in testimony to Schumer's
panel, said such ``extraordinarily harsh penalties'' could prevent
banks and S&amp;Ls from attracting qualified managers and directors.
   ``Increasing civil money penalties to such a substantial amount
sets a dangerous precedent giving regulators the power to assess
penalties that could threaten the stability of an institution,'' he
said.
   Yingling also objected to provisions of the Bush proposal
permitting regulators to decide when a violation was committed with
reckless disregard, triggering the $1 million penalty. He said fines
should be capped at $2,500 a day.
   Schumer, during a break in the hearing, said, ``I think that's
too low, but I think you could find a happy medium.''
   After the House Banking Committee acts on legislation next month,
other panels, including Schumer's, likely will amend sections coming
within their jurisdiction.
   Officials of the General Accounting Office, a congressional
investigative agency, told the subcommittee earlier that most of the
money lost by failed thrifts is attributable to fraud rather than
adverse economic conditions or deregulation. They said the GAO
examined 26 insolvent savings and loans in eight states and found
evidence of fraud or abusive insider dealing in each.
   As part of a broader bill to bail out the insurance fund backing
S&amp;L deposits, Bush is proposing spending $50 million a year on
discovering and prosecuting fraud at banks and S&amp;Ls.
   Schumer suggested that more spending might enable the Justice
Department to prosecute a greater proportion of the 4,000 pending
fraud cases involving losses of $100,000 or more.
   But the acting associate attorney general, Joe Whitely, declined
to ask for an appropriation larger than recommended by the president.
   Meanwhile, David Lewis, a New York attorney representing the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the Bush bill
represents ``a permanent threat to the rights of the people of this
nation'' and a ``blatant attempt to avoid the Constitution in
exchange for a quick economic score for the government coffers.''
   He specifically criticized provisions that would give financial
institution investigators greater access to grand jury testimony,
which is normally considered secret, and that would extend the
statute of limitations for bank fraud from five years to 10 years.
   The ABA's Yingling complained that a proposal to pay rewards of
up to $100,000 for information leading to bank fraud convictions
could ``lead to widespread abuse by disgruntled employees or
disappointed customers.'' He predicted that overworked authorities
``would be inundated with tidbits or hunches.''

<HEAD>Japan Welcomes Soviet Agreement on More Talks on Territory Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the Soviet position remains ``very rigid''
against returning a group of northern islands to Japan, Tokyo
welcomes Moscow's willingness to continue talks, a Foreign Ministry
official said Thursday.
   The nations concluded three days of working-level meetings on
Tuesday without reaching any agreement on the territorial dispute
over the Kuril islands that blocks a peace treaty to formally end
World War II hostilities.
   ``It is noteworthy that this session has taken place and both
sides agreed to have another round of talks on this issue,''
ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said at a briefing.
   ``This is something we welcome. I think we do share the common
recognition about the need to continue dialogue of this kind,'' he
added.
   The Soviet Union long has balked at even talking about the
islands off northern Japan that the Soviets seized at the end of
World War II. About 10,000 Soviet troops are stationed there.
   This time, Watanabe said, they decided to spell out their views
on the issue, ``almost for the first time.''
   The Japanese contend there never had been any question about the
islands being under Japanese rule until after World War II.
   Rather than discussing the legal points of the issue, the Soviets
insisted they had taken the lead in discovery and exploration of the
islands, Watanabe said.
   ``This is a working group discussion rather than a kind of pure
negotiations and the purpose of this is ... to deepen understanding
of the positions of each party,'' Watanabe said. ``We have found out
the Russian position is very rigid on this territory issue.''
   Asked how the talks had affected a possible visit to Japan by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Watanabe said, ``Having
studied the position of the Japanese government, if the Soviet
leader decides to come, that is welcome. ... It is up to them
whether they would decide to come.''
   Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno will visit Moscow in May.
   The working-level talks were headed by Vice Foreign Ministers
Igor Rogachev of the Soviet Union and Takakazu Kuriyama of Japan.
   They also took up Soviet-China relations, tensions in Korea and
Vietnam's withdrawal of troops from Cambodia, Foreign Ministry
officials said.

<TEXT>
   In the latest round of tit for tat diplomacy
between Washington and Moscow, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
has ordered a New York-based Soviet trade official to leave the
United States by next week, it was announced Thursday.
   With two Soviets expelled from the United States and one American
from Moscow thus far this month, State Department spokesman Charles
Redman expressed hope there will be no further expulsions.
   The ouster of Sergei Malinin, an employee of the Soviet trade
organization Amtorg, was in retaliation for Moscow's expulsion of a
U.S. Army attache from the Soviet Union last week.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Baker told Soviet
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin on Wednesday he was concerned by the Soviet
expulsion of Army Lt. Col. Francis Van Gundy on March 14.
   Dubinin had no comment when asked about the U.S. action at a
press luncheon Thursday.
   Redman, asked whether Malinin had engaged in wrongdoing, said
simply he was being declared persona non grata.
   ``We expect that Mr. Malinin's departure will put an end to this
matter,'' Redman said.
   The Soviets had accused Van Gundy of engaging in ``gross
violations of the diplomatic regime'' by secretly photographing
military sites and attempts to enter a closed area.
   At the time, U.S. officials called the allegations ``totally
unwarranted.''
   The expulsion of Van Gundy followed the U.S. ouster of a Soviet
military attache, Yuri Pakhtusov, who was accused of trying
illegally to obtain documents showing how the U.S. government
protects computer secrets.

<HEAD>Stroessner Son Ordered Arrested for `Illegal Enrichment'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LOVE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered the arrest of
deposed dictator Alfredo Stroessner's son, Gustavo, for receiving
millions of dollars in ``illegal enrichment,'' officials said
Thursday.
   The younger Stroessner, an air force colonel, accompanied his
father into exile in neighboring Brazil on Feb. 5, two days fter
Gen. Andres Rodriguez seized power in a coup.
   Judge Dario Caballero Bracho ordered Gustavo Stroessner's arrest
late Wednesday after receiving a police report describing how he
``illictly obtained copious amounts of money.''
   The report, published in part Thursday by the newspaper El
Diario, describes the colonel as a ``fugitive.'' Officials said the
court could seek an extradition order after an investigation of the
charges.
   According to the police report, Col. Stroessner received at least
$725,000 a month from three Asuncion bingo houses in 1985-88.
   ``He used psychological pressure, saying `If you don't give me my
cut I can close the business or give it to someone else,''' said
police spokesman Osvaldo Palacios. ``Everyone knew this man had the
power to decide.''
   Gambling is legal in Paraguay. Bingo houses and casinos are
licensed by the government.
   The police report also said Gustavo Stroessner was a major
stockholder in the insurance company Mundo S.A., which won several
contracts from builders of two hydroelectric projects: Itaipu on the
Brazilian border and Yacyreta on the border with Argentina.
   It said he received $21 million in insurance fees from Itaipu
alone.
   ``Part of this money was ill-gotten while another portion was a
legitimate result of the business,'' Palacios said.
   Col. Stroessner ``used his influence to obtain contracts for
third parties ... in exchange for cash award,'' the report said.
   Interior Minister Orlando Machuca Vargas said four officials of
Alfredo Stroessner's government had been sent to the interior of the
country ``for security reasons'' during the investigation of charges
against them.
   He identified them as Pastor Coronel, former chief of police
investigations; Delfin Ugarte Centurion, who was industry and
commerce minister; Gen. Gaspar Martinez, former defense minister,
and Roberto Velazquez Excobar, a former legislative leader.
   Charges against them include corruption and illegal enrichment,
Machuca said.
   Police deported Alejandro Mella Latorre, 39, a Chilean who served
six years for participating in the 1980 assassination in Asuncion of
deposed President Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua. Mella Latorre was
put on a Thursday morning flight to Santiago, Chile.

   The shuttle Discovery,
which flew a successful five-day space mission last week, began its
return flight to Florida on Thursday atop a Boeing 747 transport.
   The modified jumbo jet took off shortly after 11 a.m., bound for
Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, where it was to remain overnight and
continue the ferry flight to Kennedy Space Center on Friday, said
NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato.
   Discovery was launched March 13 on a 79-orbit mission that
deployed that last of three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites to
complete the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's shuttle
communications system.
   The orbiter landed at dawn Saturday in the California desert. It
was originally scheduled to begin a one-day flight to Florida at
dawn Friday but preparations went smoothly and the journey began a
day early.
   The flight had to be broken into two days, however, because the
takeoff was delayed by a problem with a mechanical lift used to
hoist technicians up to the plane-mounted shuttle.

<HEAD>Government Warning Issued to Newspaper Before First Edition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is threatening
punitive action against an anti-apartheid newspaper even before it
publishes its first regular edition, a spokesman for the newspaper
said Thursday.
   The newspaper, The New African, could be required to pay a
registration fee of about $16,000 to begin publishing as planned on
April 3, said spokesman Ricky Naidoo.
   The weekly, intended to serve readers in Natal Province, received
a letter last week from the Justice Ministry saying a registration
fee was under consideration.
   The government does not automatically charge a fee for a new
publication, but may do so if it rules that the publication may
later be banned for violating security regulations.
   The letter said Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee had received
information that The New African's staff was ``committed to the
South African liberation sturggle.''
   ``Information at the minister's disposal indicates that The New
African will probably operate on similar lines as the New Nation,''
said the letter, referring to a Johannesburg-based weekly newspaper
shut down by the government for three months last year for allegedly
publishing subversive material.
   Naidoo said The New African's lawyers would talk to the
government in hopes of avoiding or minimizing any fee, and expected
to get a final ruling next week.
   In a response to Coetsee, The New African protested ``the way in
which a small publication like our own is placed in jeopardy in
advance of publication.''
   The Association of Democratic Journalists, which often criticizes
government censorship, said the threat against The New African shows
the government ``has so little legitimacy that it cannot afford to
allow even a single new critical voice to be raised against it.''

<HEAD>Man Sentenced in Britain's Biggest Cocaine Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced a man to 22 years in prison
Thursday for conspiring to smuggle more than $172 million in cocaine
into Britain.
   Two Americans, Brian Van Den Breen and Robert Cermac, also were
jailed for 12 and seven years respectively for their part in
importing 880 pounds of the drug in 1986 _ the largest amount ever
smuggled into Britain.
   In passing sentence on businessman Roy Garner and the Americans,
Judge Kenneth Machin said substantial sentences were needed to
``make it clear beyond peradventure that drug-trafficking will be
stamped out by the courts.''
   He said the drugs trade ``causes untold misery, damage and
sometimes death to the takers of drugs.''
   Addressing Garner, the judge said, ``I am quite satisfied that
but for your involvement in this conspiracy, a huge quantity of
cocaine would never have come to the United Kingdom.''
   A jury found the three guilty Wednesday following a trial at the
Old Bailey Criminal Court.
   The court heard that Garner, 52, ran part of the operation from
prison after he was jailed in connection with a gold fraud case.
   Van Den Breen, 40, of London, and Cermak, 28, of Key Largo, Fla.,
pleaded guilty to taking part in the conspiracy. A 43-year-old
woman, who could not be identified under court rules, also was found
guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine. She will be sentenced at a
later date.
   The drugs were shipped from Colombia to the Cornish coast off
England in 1986, then taken to London for distribution. But when
customs officials confiscated the cocaine about a year later, only
120 pounds was left.

   Le Gavroche:
   ``Three stars'' _ Michelin guide.
   ``Two stars'' _ Egon Ronay.
   ``Not guilty'' _ Wells Street Magistrates Court.
   Magistrate Terence English on Thursday exonerated restaurateur
Albert Roux, who had been charged with 15 counts of health and
safety violations after inspectors reported ``disgusting''
conditions in his kitchen in 1986.
   English said he was not convinced by the evidence of the health
inspector, Alexander Parker-Brown, who admitted in court he had
never read the regulations governing his job. He also conceded he
had asked Roux to autograph a book for his wife.
   ``I have been referred to in the foreign press as a `reborn
Napoleon' _ but he met his Waterloo. I have not met mine,'' Roux
said before taking his wife Monique away for a celebratory glass of
champagne.
   ``I am a fighter. I like a fight. When you have worked all your
life from the age of 14 building up a reputation and suddenly a Mr.
Parker-Brown comes into your life and tries to destroy everything
you have worked for, you have to fight.''
   Roux had been charged with 11 counts under the food hygiene rules
and four under the industrial health and safety regulations. The
city will reimburse him for the cost of his defense, which Roux said
was about $170,000.
   Health inspectors had reported finding flies, grease and dirt in
the restaurant's kitchen, and pigeon droppings and cigarette butts
covering refrigerators outdoors.
   Prosecution witnesses included an entomologist who brought a
foot-high model of a fly to help explain how flies eat.
   Parker-Brown has said that in a follow-up inspection, the
restaurant's kitchens were among the cleanest he had ever seen.
   The Michelin guide had reaffirmed the restaurant's three-star
rating while the trial was being held. The only other Michelin
three-star restaurant in Britain, the Waterside Inn at Bray, is
owned by Roux's brother, Michel. The restaurant earned two stars in
Egon Ronay's guide book.
   The Roux brothers are famous in Britain because of their cooking
show on BBC-TV.

   Nearly 4.7 million acres of land were damaged
by wind in the Great Plains last winter, one of the most extensive
losses on record, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   ``Much of this damage is due to the drought,'' said Wilson
Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation Service. ``We
went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of the
Great Plains because of the drought. Then this winter, we've had a
combination of no snow cover and high-velocity winds in many areas.''
   Scaling said 88 percent of the acreage damaged was cropland, with
rangeland accounting for most of the remainder.
   The SCS surveys Great Plains damage annually from Nov. 1 through
the following May 31, a seven-month period when winds are highest
and soils are driest. The damage to 4.7 million acres was through
February.
   Scaling said the northern plains were hard hit, with Montana
showing damage to nearly 1.4 million acres, about 30 percent of the
10-state total. Losses in Montana and Wyoming have been greater than
at any time since SCS began the regular surveys in 1955.
   Agency records go back to the mid-1930s, but figures for some of
those years were obtained from other sources.
   The worst damage was done to about 16 million acres in 1954-55,
although the old Dust Bowl probably exceeded that in the early 1930s
before annual figures were compiled.
   But the 1987-88 season was bad, too, with more than 13 million
acres damaged in the region. Another was in 1980-81 when the agency
reported 12.5 million acres.
   Land is considered wind-damaged when the effects of wind are
apparent to the eye. By that time, according to conservationists,
the erosion rate has reached about 15 tons per acre a year, usually
at least three times faster than is ``tolerable,'' or naturally
replaceable.
   A loss of five tons per acre translates into a layer of soil
about the thickness of a dime spread over one acre.
   Scaling said farmers used emergency tillage on more than a
million acres to help reduce the blowing by roughing the surface
exposed to wind. Texas accounted for 80 percent of the emergency
tillage, about 880,000 acres.
   In addition to the land damaged during the four-month period,
Scaling said more than 22.5 million acres were ``in condition to
blow'' as of March 1, the most in 32 years. Highest on the list are
Kansas, North Dakota and Texas, he said.
   According to the survey, which was made in 541 counties of the
region's 10 states, here is the state-by-state breakdown comparing
damaged acres in November, December, January and February with the
same four months of 1987-88:

   Prosecutors today decided not to retry Randall
Dale Adams for the 1976 slaying of a policeman, as Adams left the
state that imprisoned him for 12 years for a murder to which another
man has all but confessed.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said the case has been
dropped because there is not enough evidence to try Adams again.
   Adams, who was freed on bail Tuesday after an appeals court March
1 overturned his 1977 conviction for killing a Dallas policeman,
boarded a plane this morning for Ohio, where his family lives, said
his attorney's office.
   ``I'll be glad to get back to Ohio,'' he said Wednesday. ``No
offense, but I hate Texas.''
   Adams, whose conviction was questioned in the 1988 documentary
film ``The Thin Blue Line,'' was headed for Grove City, outside
Columbus, where his mother, Mildred, had decorated her trailer with
yellow ribbons.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Adams' conviction
for killing Patrolman Robert Wood, saying prosecutors withheld
evidence and used perjured testimony.
   Adams originally was sentenced to death and at one point was
three days from being executed, but his sentence was commuted to
life in prison in 1980.
   Despite his experience, the 40-year-old Adams said the state's
judicial system ``in my case worked. Texas did not execute me.''
   Adams has called Dallas County ``hell on earth'' but said he
holds no grudge against Texans.
   ``I do not blame the people of Dallas or the people of Texas for
the actions of a few,'' he said.
   He also reiterated that he would welcome the chance to come back
and clear his name in a retrial.
   ``Of course I would love to have a jury release me in Dallas,''
he said. ``I did not kill Robert Wood.''
   ``I believe that if the retrial happens, we may be able to
receive some answers as to why all of this happened, and I would
like that,'' Adams said.
   His case gained international attention after the release of
``The Thin Blue Line.'' The documentary questioned the testimony of
then-16-year-old David Harris of Vidor, Texas, who had picked up
Adams the day of the shooting after Adams' car ran out of gas.
   Wood was killed after stopping a car for a traffic violation.
Adams has said Harris dropped him off before the shooting occurred.
   During the trial, Harris was the state's key witness, saying he
saw Adams kill Wood. But the film showed Harris recanting his
accusations, as well as other witnesses reporting information that
conflicted with their testimony. Harris all but confessed to the
shooting, and is on death row for another slaying.
   Adams said he has received a few job offers but has no specific
plans. He said he hasn't quite grasped the fact that he is finally
free.
   ``I just want to go home. I will see where I stand at that
point,'' he said.

   The trial of a cultural activist
facing charges that could jail her for up to five years adjourned
Thursday after a preliminary hearing, a leading dissident said.
   The trial of Eva Vidlarova on charges of obstruction of execution
of a state decision opened in the Moravian capital of Brno, said
Charter 77 activist Anna Sabatova.
   Vidlarova, a leading theater worker in the city, was detained
Dec. 19 for allegedly obstructing an investigation against another
independent cultural activist in Brno last fall.
   Sabatova said Vidlarova, who was in detention until two or three
weeks ago, denies the charge.
   About 60 people were in the courtroom for Thursday's hearing,
Sabatova said. The next hearing in the case is set for April 5, she
said.
   The trial of Dusan Skala, an independent publisher detained last
fall, opens Friday in a town near Brno, Sabatova said. He faces
charges of preparation to incitement that could jail him for up to
five years.
   The trials are the latest in a widespread crackdown on dissent
that has jailed at least seven leading activists, including the
dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, and has led to suspended
sentences and fines for dozens of other activists and sympathizers.

   Police began arming themselves Thursday
with semi-automatic rifles to guard against firebomb attacks by
protesters demanding the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo.
   The announcement of the measures prompted riots by thousands of
students in six cities.
   Police also put about 5,000 investigators of the 130,000-member
force on alert and ordered them to arrest leftists, the newspaper
Chosun Ilbo reported.
   Senior government officials, who refused to be further
identified, said police were being issued about 13,000 M-16 rifles
after the government approved better weapons for police to help
defend police posts and government facilities against mounting
firebomb attacks.
   Government buildings and police stations have been the targets of
frequent firebomb attacks by radical students. Police said scores of
policemen have been injured this year by firebombs.
   The government action prompted a strong opposition backlash.
Dissidents and opposition parties charged it could aggravate unrest,
urged Roh to rescind the decision and planned a parliamentary
hearing on the issue.
   The opposition Reunification Democratic Party denounced Roh's
decision as ``tantamount to declaring a war against the people.''
   About 5,000 students staged violent protests around campuses in
Seoul and five other cities, according to the South Korean news
agency Yonhap.
   In Seoul, riot police stopped about 800 students who tried to
march out of Sejong University with firebombs and rocks to demand
Roh' ouster.
   In Suwon, 24 miles south of Seoul, about 700 students armed with
hundreds of firebombs battled riot police for three hours,
denouncing Roh's order. At least five students and three police were
injured.
   Yonhap also reported clashes in the southern cities of Kwangju,
Chonju and Taejon and the eastern city of Chunchon.
   Roh ordered security forces Wednesday to launch a crackdown on
radicals and dissidents, warning they were a threat to stability.
   ``All government offices must cooperate to root out the violent
and destructive acts of leftists attempting to overthrow the
government,'' a presidential spokesman quoted Roh as saying.
   Roh's order was seen as a warning to radicals, who have little
support but have organized numerous protests.
   Prosecutor-General Kim Gi-chun followed up on Roh's directive by
issuing orders Thursday for a clampdown on pro-North Korean
activities.
   Kim told a meeting of senior government prosecutors the nation's
safety was at stake because of threats by leftist groups trying to
overthrow the government.
   He ordered the seizure of all pro-North Korean publications and
the arrest of people using firebombs to attack government facilities.
   On Monday, Roh postponed a promised referendum on his
performance, citing threats from radicals and disagreement on how to
hold the vote. Government hard-liners have urged Roh to end violent
protests and matain stability.
   Many South Koreans are critical of the government for failing to
sever ties with Roh's authoritarian predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, who
went into rural exile in November after making a public apology for
misdeeds under his reign.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, stepping into a State
Department spat, worked out a compromise with Paul H. Nitze that
keeps the veteran arms control specialist working for Secretary of
State James A. Baker III on a part-time basis, U.S. officials said
Thursday.
   Nitze, who at 82 can look back on nearly a half-century in
government life, wanted to stay on the job full-time as the Bush
administration prepares to resume negotiations with the Soviet Union
on nuclear weapons reductions.
   But, the officials said, he initially was offered only the role
of ambassador-emeritus, meaning he would be on occasional call, and
turned it down.
   ``There was no major spat,'' an official told The Associated
Press. ``It was all handled in a gentlemanly way.''
   But still, the officials said on condition of anonymity, Nitze
had freed his staff to take other jobs and was prepared to leave
himself until Bush invited him to the White House a few weeks ago to
discuss the situation.
   The session, the officials said, produced the compromise that he
would be a part-time consultant to the president and to Baker. His
resignation as a full-time adviser, effective May 1, still stands.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, rejected
published accounts that linked Nitze's departure to disagreements
with Baker over what Nitze's job would be in the Bush
administration, saying the reports were ``unfortunate because they
are inaccurate.''
   ``Having talked to both sides I feel confident in assuring you
that there was not that kind of atmosphere involved in this
particular case,'' Redman said.
   Nitze, under former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, played a
key role in the U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in 1987 to abolish
intermediate-range nuclear missiles. His government service began
nearly 50 years ago.

horse fell during a riding jaunt two weeks ago.

   Zoo professionals and animal rights activists
consider the Bronx Zoo the best in America, Parade magazine
announced Thursday.
   The magazine said it drew that conclusion from questionnaires and
interviews of 86 people out of 400 who were asked to identify the 10
best and 10 worst zoos.
   After the Bronx Zoo, whose formal name is New York Zoological
Park, the best zoos were, alphabetically:
   Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, Tucson, Ariz.; Audubon Park and
Zoological Garden, New Orleans; Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield,
Ill.; Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden; Los Angeles Zoo; National
Zoological Park, Washington, D.C.; St. Louis Zoological Park; San
Diego Zoo; and Woodland Park Zoological Gardens, Seattle, Wash.
   The 10 worst, also alphabetically:
   Brevard Zoological Park, Melbourne, Fla.; Franklin Park Zoo,
Boston; Glen Oak Zoo, Peoria, Ill.; Knowland Park Oakland Zoo,
Oakland, Calif.; Nay Aug Zoo, Scranton, Pa.; Prospect Park Zoo, New
York City; Saunookes Bear Land, Cherokee, N.C.; Space Farms Zoo and
Museum, Sussex, N.J.; Terry Lou Zoo, Scotch Plains, N.J.; and Walk
in the Wild, Spokane, Wash.
   The Franklin Park, Prospect Park and Nay Aug zoos also were on
the worst list in a Parade magazine rating five years ago.
   The Prospect Park Zoo in Brooklyn is being taken over by the
Bronx Zoo and is to be modernized and upgraded.

<DATELINE>NOORDWIJKERHOUT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 women police
officers from 39 countries called for better career opportunities
Thursday as they ended a conference on issues ranging from child
care at the police station to sexual harassment in the patrol car.
   ``Although more and more women are now pursuing a career in law
enforcement, the top slots in police organizations worldwide remain
in the hands of men,'' said Maj. Marian de Labije, one of the Dutch
organizers of the four-day meet.
   ``And that means that it also remains very difficult to draw the
attention of the higher echelons to the problems facing female
police personnel,'' Ms. De Labije said.
   She noted only a handful of about 100 male Dutch police
commanders and other law enforcement dignitaries invited to the
conference's opening Monday showed up.
   The conference, the first of its kind to be held outside North
America, where women police officers founded their organization as
early as in 1915, was attended by women police officers from nations
ranging from Bahrain to the United States to Zimbabwe.
   ``What we ought to do is change the minds of men, their dinosaur
mentality,'' said Kathy Burke, a detective in the Narcotics Division
of the New York City police department and the president of the
International Association of Women Police Officers, an organization
with members in the United States and Canada.
   ``Men and women must train side by side to convince the men that
we're not just the captain's girl,'' Ms. Burke said in an interview
in this western Dutch town 20 miles southwest of Amsterdam.
   In the Netherlands, 7 percent of the nation's 30,000-member
police force is female, a figure that reflects the situation in many
parts of the world, said Ms. De Labije. In New York, 3,000 of the
city's 28,000 police officers are women.
   The Dutch want to increase the women's share to 25 percent by
1995, but Ms. De Labije said it's unlikely that goal will be met.
   One of the problems facing women in law enforcement is proper
child care, said Ms. Burke, who brought her two children to the
conference.
   ``In New York, they're trying to develop a child care system, but
so far, only civil personnel is benefiting from it because it's a
9-to-5 scheme,'' Ms. Burke said. ``It's worthless to people who're
working in shifts.''
   The only area where proper child care facilities are less of a
roadblock is Africa, where such care traditionally has been part of
the extended family, said Ms. de Labije, an officer in the Juvenile
Department of the Dutch National Police.
   One of the conference's workshops dealt with sexual behavior in a
mixed police force, but the problem of harassment seems to be on the
wane, according to Superintendant Phyllis Nolan of the Police
Community Relations Department in Dublin, Ireland.
   ``It is easier now for female officers now that there is total
integration, now all sections are open to women,'' said Ms. Nolan.
   ``The acceptance is good, and we have women in all departments,
from motorcycle patrol people to special branch detectives,'' said
Ms. Nolan, who noted that until 1974, women police officers were
forced to resign from the Irish Garda when they married.
   At the meeting, participants from Western Europe founded the
European Network for Policewomen, which plans another conference in
two years.

<TEXT>
   Syrian army gunners and allied Druse
militiamen fought artillery duels with Christian army units
Thursday, and police said 15 people were killed and 42 wounded.
   Most of the casualties were civilians in Christian east Beiruts,
where rockets sometimes landed at the rate of 40 a minute.
   A police spokesman said the dead included an 80-year-old woman
who was crossing the street in east Beirut's Saloumeh residential
district. A Lebanese soldier also was wounded, police said.
   The new casualities brought the toll to 81 killed and 253 wounded
since fighting began March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands
the 20,000 Christians in the Lebanese army, and the Druse militia
led by Walid Jumblatt.
   Other Moslem militias and the 22,000 Moslem soldiers led by Maj.
Gen. Sami Khatib appear to have stayed out of the dispute. The
fighting threatens Arab League efforts to mediate a political crisis
that split the army on sectarian lines and created competing
Christian and Moslem governments.
   Aoun heads the Christian government in addition to commanding the
army's Christian units.
   More than 5,000 shells and rockets landed overnight in both
sectors of the capital, in the Christian region to the north and
east, and Druse-held territory to the southeast.
   Residents of Aramoun, seven miles south of Beirut, said Syrian
gunners operated rocket launchers overnight from the hill on which
the village sits. It was the first independent confirmation of
Syrian involvement.
   Aoun has accused Syria of firing on the 310-square-mile Christian
region, where 1 million Christians live in a crescent-shaped enclave
with the Mediterranean at their backs.
   One witness in Aramoun said Syrian rocket launchers were
``pouring fire all night at the Christian sector.''
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon and has become the country's
main power broker during a 14-year civil war. Aoun has declared a
``war of liberation'' against the Syrian forces.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said all
foreign troops except for peacekeepers of the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon should leave the country.
   Asked if that included Syria, Redman said: ``That would be all
those non-Lebanese armed elements and organizations currently on
Lebanese soil, with the exception of UNIFIL.''
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across Beirut and the
surrounding wooded mountains. Residents huddled in basements and
bomb shelters.
   The latest violence began two days after Aoun blockaded private
ports militias use to finance their operations, which skim the
government otherwise would collect at the five legal harbors on
Lebanon's 130-mile coastline.
   Lebanon's government has been divided since Sept. 22, when
Parliament could not agree on a successor to President Amin Gemayel
and he appointed Aoun to lead an interim military cabinet.
   Moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to Salim
Hoss, the Sunni Moslem premier who served during Gemayel's term.
   Under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from
France in 1943, Lebanon's president is a Christian, the premier a
Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.

   Egg production is down about 6 percent from a

Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Total production during the first three months of the marketing
year that began Dec. 1 was estimated at 16.7 billion eggs, down from
17.7 billion a year earlier, the department said in a report.
   As of March 1, laying hens totaled 271 million, down from 282
million a year ago. The March 1 flock included about 232 million
hens producing eggs for consumer use, and 38.9 million producers of
hatching-type eggs.
   The department's Economic Research Service says 1989 egg
production is expected to be down around 2 percent fromf last year
because of the reduction in laying hens.
   Producers cut back flocks in response to the lowest net returns
since USDA began estimating those figures in 1972, the agency said.

<TEXT>
   A human rights lawyer died of his
injuries one day after being shot by an unidentified gunman, a human
rights organization said Thursday.
   Oscar Tonog, 37, was the sixth human rights lawyer slain during
the administration of President Corazon Aquino.
   He died Wednesday from bullet wounds to the head and chest
suffered in Tuesday's attack in Catarman, capital of Northern Samar
province, about 300 miles southeast of Manila, according to the Free
Legal Assistance Group.
   Word of his death reached Manila on Thursday shortly after the
group sent a chartered plane to transfer Tonog to Manila for
surgery, said Milabel Cristobal, a member of the group.
   The group on Wednesday blamed the attack on the military, which
has also been accused of involvement in the previous killings of
lawyers. The military has denied most of the charges.
   A member of a government-organized militia was convicted of
murder after admitting he was the gunman in the 1988 slaying of
human rights lawyer Alfonso Surigao last year, but charges were
dropped against a military major whom the gunman identified as the
mastermind. The other killings remain unsolved.
   All the victims were members of the legal assistance group or
other human rights organizations. They all acted as defense
attorneys for people accused of either being communist rebels or of
supporting the insurgents.
   ``These attacks against human rights lawyers also symbolize a
breakdown in the judicial machinery and the death of the rule of
law,'' the group said. ``While no lawyer is safe to fight for
people's rights in the courts, due process and other guarantees of
human rights enshrined in the constitution remain beautiful but
empty phrases.''
   The group said Wednesday that four gunmen attacked Tonog while he
and his wife, Merlita, were at a roadside shed waiting for a ride
home during a heavy rain. Mrs. Tonog was not hurt.
   On Thursday, it said only one gunman was involved and that he
shot Tonog from point-blank range in the head, chest and back. The
gunman fled aboard a motorcycle driven by an unidentified companion.
   Tonog had received many death threats recently, the group said.
He survived a knife attack in 1981 in his Catarman law office, and
the assailant, a policeman, was arrested, tried and convicted.
   Mrs. Aquino ordered investigations into the other killings after
human rights and lawyers' groups charged it was only since she took
over from deposed President Ferdinand Marcos three years ago that
lawyers were being killed for defending alleged subversives.
   During Marcos' 20-year rule, most forms of harassment of alleged
subversives' attorneys consisted only of telephone threats, bugged
telephone lines and military surveillance, lawyers have said.

   Officials said Thursday that the nation's eight
so-called democratic political parties will continue to operate
under communist guidance and that new parties will not be allowed.
   On Tuesday, Communist Party authorities announced a plan to allow
the eight parties to participate in the government. Yan Mingfu, who
heads the Communist Party's office that deals with other parties,
said the plan will be ready by June or July.
   The parties will operate only under the leadership of the
Communist Party, which has ruled China since 1949, he said.
   The plan comes as a growing number of intellectuals are calling
for more political freedom and appears to be an attempt by the
Communist Party to silence critics without relinquishing power.
   Leaders of the eight parties said Thursday they expected more
government officials to be appointed from their ranks.
   ``The Communist Party of China and the eight democratic parties
share the same goals. We are in the same boat,'' Wan Guoquan, vice
chairman of the China Democratic National Committee, said at a news
conference.
   ``Just like a symphony, a country needs a conductor. The
Communist Party is our conductor.''
   The news conference was held by the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, a prestigious but powerless advisory body
currently meeting in Beijing.
   Members of the conference said new political parties are not
needed because the eight democratic parties represent a wide range
of China's people.

<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr.
said Thursday that the nation's capital remains safe for tourists
and visiting business people, even in the face of a record murder
rate.
   ``For the most part, the targeted killings and drug activity take
place in a small section of the city,'' Barry told a luncheon
audience at the National Press Club. ``Except for the killings,
Washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.''
   Barry's address, the first delivered by a Washington mayor to the
press club in 81 years, came in the midst of a drug-related crime
wave that has thrust Barry's government into the international
spotlight.
   In 1988, a record 372 people were killed in the district; police
say drugs played a part in 60 percent of those killings. Through
Thursday, 119 people have been murdered this year in the nation's
capital, roughly twice the number at the same time last year.
   Barry stressed repeatedly that Washington's drug-related killings
are occurring in poorer neighborhoods far from the downtown and the
national monuments.
   ``Congress is safe; everyone is safe,'' Barry said. ``I hope to
come back here next year and tell you Washington is safer than ever
before.''
   Barry, who is under federal investigation for his ties to a drug
suspect, said that the city's crime problems _ not his personal
difficulties _ are behind the city's public relations difficulties.
   ``Drugs are the problem, not Marion Barry,'' the mayor said. ``I
urge the media to be fair.''
   The mayor said he welcomed assistance from federal officials in
curbing the city's drug problem.
   He said he has had ``productive'' conversations recently with
Bush administration drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett, who
is considering giving the city extra federal aid and personnel to
fight its drug problem.
   He also said he would welcome the opportunity to talk with Rep.
Stan Parris, R-Va., who said Wednesday he plans to introduce
legislation in the House to have the federal government take control
of the city's police force.

   An American Airlines jet took off from the wrong
runway Thursday, struck several construction barricades and damaged
the plane's underside before landing safely in Dallas.
   American Flight 508, carrying 92 passengers and a crew of six
from Houston's Hobby Airport, arrived on time at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport where passengers deplaned normally, American
officials said.
   Airport ground crews found three of 13 wooden barriers destroyed
in addition to a 4-by-4-foot plywood sign, said Sam Maloney, a
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in Fort Worth.
   American spokesman Ed Stewart confirmed that the plane hit the
sign and a wooden sawhorse, adding that the plane sustained damage
to the bottom of the tail section and the wheel base.
   Tina Ceppi, spokeswoman for the Houston Aviation Department,
which operates Hobby, said barricades mark a runway section closed
because of construction.
   The pilot, whose name was not released, had been provided with
recorded information before the takeoff saying the last 2,200 feet
of the runway was closed because of construction, Maloney said.
   The pilot was in Washington late Thursday afternoon and was
``giving his side of the story'' to American officials, Stewart said.
   ``We have to ascertain what happened first before we can say what
action we will take,'' Stewart said.
   The FAA is continuing its invesigation and no immediate action
was taken.
   The pilot twice had been cleared to take off on a longer runway,
but turned down the wrong one, said Geraldine Cook, an FAA
spokeswoman.
   Shortly after the pilot began taxiing down the runway,
controllers noticed he was on the wrong runway and tried to radio
him but received no response, Maloney said.
   Once an aircraft is cleared for takeoff, a pilot can switch radio
frequencies, and that may have been the case with the American
pilot, he said.
   During the plane's ascent, the tower told the pilot he may have
hit a barricade, Maloney said. The pilot acknowledged that he
thought he hit it. The pilot thought it was safe to continue, Ms.
Cook said.

   The White House on Thursday played down a U.S.
warning about the possible hijacking of an American airliner in
Europe, saying the bulletin was similar to many other terrorist
alerts and travelers ``should be confident that all reasonable
precautions are being taken.''
   Airports in England, West Germany, Italy and Belgium stepped up
security after receiving the warning issued by the Federal Aviation
Administration. No additional precautions were reported in the
Netherlands, Greece or Spain.
   The Bush administration was clearly unhappy the warning had
leaked out in a front-page newspaper story in London. Transportation
Secretary Samuel K. Skinner called it a potentially serious
compromise of intelligence-gathering activities and ordered an FAA
investigation of the disclosure.
   Three Lebanese Palestinians were mentioned by name in the
warning, according to the Daily Express. The bulletin said the three
may be traveling on passports from Bahrain, Pakistan or North Yemen.
   The FAA confirmed that it had issued a security bulletin to
airports and carriers March 16 about ``the possibility of a
hijacking of a U.S. airliner in Western Europe.''
   The warning did not mention any specific airline or airport that
might be threatened, nor did it cite any time frame for the warning,
the FAA said.
   Disputing the Daily Express accoun, U.S. officials emphatically
denied that the notice had been relayed to U.S. diplomats and
military personnel abroad while being withheld from the public at
large _ as was the case with a warning prior to the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people on Dec. 21.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said last week's
warning was intended to heighten ``the already high security
procedures now in effect'' and was not designed for public
distribution. He said the alert was directed to authorities ``who
can direct responses to the threat.
   ``Travelers on U.S. air carriers should be confident that all
reasonable precautions are being taken to insure that the highest
level of security exists,'' he said.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the
House aviation subcommittee, said the warning had been distributed
only among intelligence and law enforcement agents so that they
could pursue further information.
   ``I'm persuaded there was not a double standard,'' he said,
referring to accusations the government in the past has warned its
employees about terrorist threats but not alerted the public.
   ``As for the question (of) is it safe for American people
traveling, yes,'' Oberstar said, citing beefed up security resulting
from the warning. He spoke with reporters after members of his panel
received a previously scheduled, private three-hour briefing on
aviation security from government and industry officials.
   The FAA would not reveal what had prompted the alert, other than
to say there had been ``sensitive information'' not designed for
public distribution.
   ``The release of this information by unauthorized persons can be
counterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts to
provide a totally effective security system,'' the FAA said.
   Skinner said, ``Hopefully, no one will lose their life over this,
but it is a very serious matter.''
   Army Maj. Dennis Pinkham, a spokesman for the U.S. European
Command, which is in charge of U.S. military forces in Europe, said
the command was aware of the warning but did not pass it along to
military personnel.
   Discussing the warning at a White House briefing, Fitzwater said,
``My understanding is it is similar to many, many similar kinds of
information and security bulletins that go out and would be, in
fact, lower than many because it was not given to any military or
diplomatic personnel, but rather just to security experts ... at
aviation airports and airlines.''
   Refusing to divulge the contents of the bulletin, Fitzwater said,
``I can't comment (on) what's in this bulletin. I don't want to
unnecessarily scare people or to present public information that
might be harmful in many ways. That's the reason it's not made
public in the first place.''
   He said intelligence agencies routinely collect information about
the travel of terrorists or people who are on a suspect list. ``Some
of this information, like all intelligence information, is
questionable. Some of it has higher value than others. ...
   ``Unless it has a certain degree of authenticity or believability
or credibility or whatever,'' he said, ``you can't go out and make
general warnings to the public. So that's the situation we're in.''
   The Daily Express printed some of the memorandum, which read in
part:
   ``Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a U.S.
airliner in Europe. Possible names: Jamel Hahmud Talid Muhammed:
Ahmed Muhammad Salim Abuzayni: Khalour Muhammed Jafar.
   ``Alias passports: Bahrain, Pakistan, North Yemen, possible
genuine@forged or altered.
   ``Above information credible although not confirmed.''

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres backed a
Palestinian ``entity'' Thursday as a key to peace in the occupied
lands, where hospital officials said soldiers killed a 14-year-old
boy and wounded 18 other people.
   He said he would urge Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of
the conservative Likud bloc, to accept the peace plan before the
premier visits the United States next month. Peres is finance
minister in the ``national unity'' coalition of Likud and his
center-left party.
   Newspaper reports said the plan calls for a Palestinian state in
all but name, demilitarized and in confederation with Jordan and
Israel. Peres denied recommending a separate state in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured in the 1967 war.
   Arab hospital officials said soldiers in the occupied territories
shot the boy and wounded 18 other Palestinians. At least 405
Palestinians have been killed since an uprising began in the West
Bank and Gaza more than 15 months ago, and 18 Israelis also have
been slain.
   The army denied any troopers were in the West Bank village at the
time, but said it was investigating a report that civilian Israelis
in the area responded with gunfire when their car was stoned. A
spokesman said he had reports of six gunshot wounds.
   Also Wednesday, Labor and its rival, the right-wing Likud bloc
led by Shamir, agreed to allocate $19.4 million to fund Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories.
   Media reports said Likud demanded almost twice that sum, but
Peres' Finance Ministry refused.
   Haaretz, a Hebrew-language daily, said the Peres peace plan calls
for a one-year truce in the occupied lands, including a moratorium
on the uprising.
   ``In essence, we are talking about abandoning our control of the
territories, of Judea and Samaria. It's clear it would be handed
over to some form of Arab sovereignty,'' said Ephraim Sneh, a Labor
Party member who worked on the plan, using the biblical names for
the West Bank.
   Sneh said details have yet to be worked out but the plan has two
stages, with the problems of sovereignty and the link to Jordan to
be addressed in the second stage.
   On television Thursday, Peres said ``we are ready for territorial
compromise'' but vigorously denied calling for a Palestinian state,
a risky political concept in Israel, and gave no details.
   ``I have not proposed a Palestinian state,'' he said. ``I have
ruled out the Palestinian state. I will present my plan to Mr.
Shamir.''
   He used the phrases ``Palestinian entity'' and ``confederation,
according to the example of Benelux'' in describing his plan.
   The Haaretz report said Peres calls the plan ``the Benelux
model,'' a reference to the close cooperation between Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg.
   It said the Peres plan would create a three-state federation
involving Israel, Jordan and a Palestinian ``entity'' that would be
a nation in all ways except that it would have no army.
   Israeli troops would withdraw, but maintain a presence along the
strategic Jordan River valley.
   After an informal truce began, direct talks between Israel and a
Palestinian delegation elected from the occupied territories would
open in Geneva under international auspices.
   Representatives of the ``Palestinian diaspora,'' presumably the
Palestine Liberation Organization, would be brought in at a later
stage, Haaretz said.
   Peres said on television Thursday: ``The PLO has changed. You
can't deny it.''
   Israel still regards the PLO as a terrorist organization and
refuses to deal with it, but the United States began contacts in
December, after Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist. The second formal meeting was
held Wednesday.
   Avraham Burg, a Labor Party dove, said the plan published in
Haaretz was a rough version of a proposal that has been developed
further. ``It's in the right general direction,'' he said of the
newspaper report.
   Soldiers shot six Palestinians Thursday in the Gaza Strip and
wounded 12 in the West Bank, hospital officials said.
   At Ousarin village, near Nablus in the West Bank, 14-year-old
Maher Shakid Said was shot in the chest and killed, according to
officials of Ittihad Hospital in Nablus.
   A military court sentenced four Palestinian guerrillas to life
imprisonment Thursday for trying to enter Israel from Lebanon last
year. The Palestinians confessed to the attempt and said they
belonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a
radical Syrian-based faction of the PLO.

<HEAD>Democrats Gird for Gingrich Battle, Release Letter about his `Questionable
Activities'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats, girding for expected partisan
warfare following Rep. Newt Gingrich's selection as House minority
whip, circulated a letter Thursday raising ``unanswered questions''
about Gingrich's activities.
   ``Where I come from, you don't look for a fight. But you don't
run from one either,'' said Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark. ``If you
don't fight back, you lose.''
   Alexander said Democrats needed an organized campaign to combat
Gingrich, who rose to prominence within House GOP ranks largely on
the basis of his ethics campaign against Speaker Jim Wright and two
dozen other prominent Democrats.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, sent all House Democrats a letter
Thursday listing a ``summary of some of the unanswered questions''
about Gingrich's activities.
   ``Gingrich's penchant for slinging mud is surprising, since his
own career is checkered with a string of questionable activities,''
Anthony said in the letter. ``In light of these developments, I
though it would be useful to familiarize yourself with some examples
of the Gingrich style.''
   The letter summarized questions raised previously by the DCCC
about an unusual promotional deal for Gingrich's book, ``Window of
Opportunity,'' about $13,000 Gingrich received in 1977 to write a
novel that never was published, and about a political action
committee chaired by Gingrich which raised $217,868 in direct-mail
solicitations for conservative candidates but spent only $900 on
political campaigns.
   Reporters' repeated telephone calls to Gingrich's office seeking
comment on the letter were not immediately returned. Gingrich has
said previously that he has committed no improprieties.
   Anthony said Gingrich has been ``a bomb thrower for 10 years'' in
the House and the fact that he is now being rewarded by his GOP
colleagues means that Democrats can use him as ammunition against
all of them.
   ``That's a gold mine of campaign issues,'' he said.
   If Gingrich intends to be a successful whip, however, Anthony
said, he might have to change his tactics.
   ``He's been the kind of guy who wants to burn the building down,
and he doesn't care if some of his own members get burned in the
fire,'' Anthony said. But in the GOP leadership, there is ``the
potential to defang him.''
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., compared Gingrich to a famous figure
of plains, Gen. George Armstrong Custer.
   ``Custer was a hard charger and everybody got excited about him
too,'' he said. ``That didn't work out so well.''

<HEAD>FDA: Yellow Light on AIDS Home Tests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration remains
cautious about the safety, accuracy and privacy of home AIDS-test
kits as currently proposed, FDA Commissioner Frank Young told a
congressional panel Thursday.
   Young told members of House subcommittee on regulation, business
opportunities and energy that ``caution at this time is prudent''
because of concerns about technical feasibility as well as privacy
and counseling.
   ``In this disease ... there is a death sentence given with a
positive test and without the appropriate interpretation and
counseling, the Food and Drug Administration is apprehensive that
some individuals might not only have major psychological concerns
but might do themselves harm,'' Young said.
   More than a dozen companies indicated interest to the FDA last
year in developing home AIDS-testing kits, all requiring users to
collect blood samples at home and send them to laboratories for
testing. The results would be supplied by mail or telephone.
   The FDA has not approved any such home-testing kits for AIDS, and
has restricted market research on such tests to hospitals, clinics,
doctors' offices and other traditional health-care settings.
   Young said the FDA still has concerns about whether test
suppliers can assure that blood samples can be collected properly
and remain unchanged by temperature extremes in transit to
laboratories. Also, he said, he questions whether tests used will be
as accurate as those available used by health-care practitioners and
whether results will remain confidential.
   The agency will hold a public hearing April 6 to further explore
the issue, he said.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., subcommittee chairman, said he also has
concerns about home AIDS-testing. He said he is ``convinced that in
the hands of the untrained, the unscrupulous and the insensitive,
home AIDS testing can inflict considerable human damage.''
   AIDS advocates share the FDA's concerns, especially about the
need for adequate counseling of people who test positive for the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``We are deeply concerned that making a home-test available with
a relatively high false positive rate might well be irresponsible in
playing with the emotions of already frightened and concerned
individuals,'' Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay
&amp; Lesbian Task Force, told the panel.
   He added that testing is only part of the key to controlling
AIDS. Counseling about risk in spreading the disease is also
integral, he said.
   ``Testing does not occur in a vacuum. It is most effective when
accompanied by quality counseling _ counseling that is best provided
and assured in person,'' he said.
   However, Elliot J. Millenson of Rockville, Md., who founded a
company that developed an AIDS home-test, said potential benefits of
such a test far outweigh the potential risks.
   He said experience has shown that people can safely obtain a
small amount of blood for testing and the sample can be safely
packaged and withstand unusual and adverse shipping conditions.
   He also maintained that telephone counseling is as effective as
in-person counseling, and that in fact doctors already provide AIDS
test results and results of tests for other fatal diseases such as
cancer over the phone.

   For 92 years, the city Board of Estimate has
wielded immense power over the metropolis, giving approval to
landmarks like Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building and the
World Trade Center.
   But that power has been jeopardized by the U.S. Supreme Court
decision declaring the eight-member body unconstitutional under the
one-person, one-vote principle.
   Borough presidents from each of the city's five boroughs are
given one vote, while the mayor, comptroller and City Council
president get two each.
   The board's duties including awarding franchises, negotiating
contracts with municipal unions, leasing property, and making zoning
and tax abatement decisions.
   The board was conceived in 1864 for the sole purpose of raising
and spending money for a regional police force. It's modern
composition came with the consolidation of New York City in 1898.

<TEXT>
   The power struggle between
President P.W. Botha and the new leader of the National Party, F.W.
de Klerk, has been resolved, and Botha will retire after an election
later this year, news reports said Thursday.
   ``The fight is over,'' an unidentified government source told The
Star, South Africa's largest-selling daily.
   A compromise was reached in a meeting Tuesday calling for Botha
to step down after a general election in the second half of 1989,
the newspaper and government-run television reported.
   Neither de Klerk nor Botha has commented on the reported meeting.
   Botha, 73, suffered a stroke Jan. 18 and spent eight weeks
recuperating. He resigned as leader of the governing National Party
on Feb. 2 and was replaced by de Klerk, the minister of national
education.
   The party's parliamentary caucus later announced it wanted de
Klerk to become president to reunify the two positions. But Botha,
resisting pressure to retire after a decade in power, declared he
would serve until the next general election and said there would be
no early election this year.
   The deadline for the next election is March 1990.
   ``The mood in the National Party is cautious relief and
optimism,'' government-run television reported in an evening
broadcast.
   It said the compromise was reached after ``senior Cabinet members
played mediating roles.''
   The Star said Botha reluctantly agreed to the compromise ``after
finally accepting that the Natonal Party no longer wants him,
something reported to have hurt him deeply.''
   The newspaper said an announcement about an early election date
might be made in April. A meeting of the Nationalist caucus is
scheduled for April 8.
   The television report said an announcement was expected after
Easter weekend.
   De Klerk, 53, has yet to break with any of Botha's major
policies, but he is widely viewed as more flexible and pragmatic
than Botha.

<HEAD>New York Scrambles To Revamp Governing Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after the U.S. Supreme Court signed a death
warrant for the city's powerful Board of Estimate, officials were
unsure Thursday whether the unusual governing body would linger, be
reincarnated, leave a respectable heir or bequeath confusion upon
voters.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he believes the board can go about its
business until a replacement emerges.
   ``Based on normal constitutional law and actions by the Supreme
Court on prior matters ... I believe the Board of Estimate, until
the change occurs, is legal,'' he said.
   The Supreme Court ruled that the board's make-up violates the one
person-one vote principle because each of the city's five boroughs
has one vote on the board although they range in population from
Staten Island's 377,600 to Brooklyn's 2.3 million.
   The Board of Estimate was set up 92 years ago and wields great
power in New York. It decides questions of land use, zoning,
franchises and city contracts, and shares budget-making power with
the City Council. The city has a $25 billion budget this year, and
has to adopt a new one by June 30.
   Peter Zimroth, the city's chief lawyer, said courts usually give
governments ``a reasonable period of time'' to make adjustments in
such cases so as not to disrupt normal activities.
   One possibility is that residents could vote in a referendum for
a new government structure in November, when the city has its next
major election scheduled.
   That scenario could force voters to cast ballots for candidates
without knowing what powers their offices would attain. All the
positions on the Board of Estimate _ mayor, city comptroller, City
Council president and five borough presidencies _ are up for
election.
   Koch said during a news conference with Gov. Mario Cuomo that he
was confident the city will restructure its government in a way that
will hold up in court.
   ``It's an easier problem to deal with than drugs and AIDS,'' he
remarked.
   And Cuomo said of the court ruling, ``I don't think it's a bad
thing at all.''
   He said the Charter Revision Commission, which was established in
anticipation of the ruling, must be careful in addressing Staten
Island's participation in government.
   Staten Island, the least typical borough with a higher proportion
of homeowners and open spaces, and always prickly about being
disregarded, risks the most in a revision.
   Borough President Ralph Lamberti already has spoken of secession
if the island is left with only a weak voice in how the city is run.
A spokesman for the governor of New Jersey joked Thursday that
Staten Island is welcome to become part of the Garden State.
   Koch said one way to conform to the Supreme Court ruling would be
to keep the board and give the borough presidents votes weighted by
population, but that would not give Staten Island the say it demands.
   Richard Ravitch, former chairman of the Charter Revision
Commission and now a candidate for mayor, said last year he favored
eliminating the board, which blends legislative with executive
functions.
   He suggested giving its budget powers to the City Council,
strengthening the role of the borough presidents in setting budget
priorities and reducing the mayor's. He would set up a land-use
review board, give zoning authority to the council and have mayoral
agencies approve contracts.
   That would leave the City Council as a unicameral legislature and
the borough presidents functioning more like other county executives
in the state.
   City Council Majority Leader Peter Vallone said he favors that
kind of separation of powers. He said the court's decision
``reaffirms my confidence that a balanced and fair government will
soon be in place in New York City.''
   Officials must also take into account that any changes must
conform to the federal Voting Rights Act by not diluting the voting
power of minority group members.
   Gretchen Dykstra, spokesman for the charter commission, said the
commission had set April 4 for public hearings on ideas for
reconstruction of the board, but that date was picked before the
court ruling and might change.
   She said it was expected that the commission would draw up its
recommendations in time to put on the ballot as a referendum in
November.

<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Earl testimony, inserting 5 grafs after 17th graf,
She testified; trims at end</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

   A weeping Fawn Hall praised former boss Oliver
North Thursday as an inspirational, tireless and selfless man and
said their wholesale shredding of Iran-Contra documents ``was no big
deal.''
   Alternately crying and spitting back sharp responses, Miss Hall
twice appeared unable to go on with her testimony at North's trial,
causing impromptu recesses. Her sympathies throughout were obviously
with North, though she hardly ever looked at him.
   ``It's tough when people portray you as a witness for the
prosecution when you are a witness for the truth,'' she said outside
the courthouse. ``Hopefully, the good guy will win.''
   She called North's firing by then-President Reagan on Nov. 25,
1986, unfair. ``I was very upset,'' she recalled. ``When I heard
about it, I was very angry.''
   Miss Hall, who was North's secretary at the National Security
Council for nearly four years, admitted that when attorney general's
investigators were closing in on Nov. 21, 1986, she altered
documents to soften recorded versions of North's involvement with
the Nicaraguan Contras. She also said she helped him in what has
been called ``a shredelease of American hostages held in Lebanon and that
profits were to be diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras. He said he
worked out a price sheet for 240 missile parts, tacking on a $2.70
profit for each $1 cost.
   Earl testified that he and North made arrangements that if North
were taken hostage in Iran, ``that I was to go into his safe ... and
destroy contents of the bottom drawer.'' He was not asked what was
in the drawer.
   The jurors were given a four-day weekend for Good Friday and
Easter and Earl is expected back on the stand Tuesday. Also next
week, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III is to be a witness,
before the prosecution rests its case.
   The slender, blonde Miss Hall, who became an instant celebrity
when she testified in the televised congressional hearings in 1987,
proved a magnet at the North trial as well. The public lines outside
the courtroom were longer for her appearance than at any previous
time during the trial which began on Jan. 31.
   She said many work days at the NSC offices in the White House

<BYLINE>Walesa Not Ruling Out Candidacy for Parliament ^By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Thursday
he would rather not run for a seat in Poland's new parliament, but
he said he would if the people want him to.
   He also said his banned independent union movement will look for
answers ``in the streets and by strikes'' if no final agreement on
reforms is reached at historic talks between the opposition and
Communist leaders.
   Neither will Solidarity tolerate ``tricks'' by officials in
implementing an accord, he said.
   Walesa made the statements at a news conference in his home city
of Gdansk and in a subsequent telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
   At the talks in Warsaw, negotiators continued to discuss economic
and political topics separating the two sides.
   Walesa's comments cast doubt on whether a final agreement could
be signed April 3 as planned. He said he would need about a week to
study the document, which could be hundreds of pages long.
   ``I must familiarize myself with the entire material. ... Even if
it takes more time, it will be understood, because we must do it
well,'' Walesa said.
   A decision to run for the existing parliament or for a newly
created senate would depend ``on the wish of the voters,'' he said.
   ``I don't want to be a candidate. But there are situations when
one must do it,'' Walesa said later by telephone. ``But I really
would not like to, simply because there are many people better than
me.''
   Elections with opposition participation are part of the
far-reaching compromise authorities are seeking at the talks. In
exchange for legalization, Solidarity would agree to elections that
guarantee in advance that a Communist-led coalition would get 65
percent of the existing parliament seats.
   But the new senate would be fully democratic, with opposition
candidates running against Communist-approved candidates for the
first time in the East bloc.
   Although Solidarity has said it would support candidates in
elections to the existing parliament, tentatively planned for June,
most union officials have said they would prefer to concentrate on
union issues.
   Some Solidarity activists also have expressed concern privately
that the union might not be able to find candidates quickly enough
to run for the 35 percent of the 460 seats to be open to the
opposition, and for the 100 or so seats contemplated for the new
senate.
   ``There may be, for example, a situation when I'll have to agree
(to run) because other people refuse,'' Walesa said in the telephone
interview. ``But I really don't want to.''
   Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was
born in 1980 and banned after martial law was imposed in 1981.

   A 21-year-old man was ordered held without
bail Thursday after surrendering to police in the ``vicious, savage
killing'' of a 13-year-old neighbor girl whose battered body was
found in his basement.
   Robert Golub was arraigned on the murder charge shortly after his
arrest in the slaying of Kelly Ann Tinyes in the quite suburban
neighborhood their families had shared for 11 years.
   ``We have forensic evidence at the scene that points to Robert
Golub. ... All of the evidence we do have points to him,'' Nassau
County Chief of Detectives Wayne Seay said Thursday.
   Seay said Robert's 14-year-old brother, John Jay Golub, a onetime
schoolmate of Kelly's, is still a suspect as well and the
investigation is continuing.
   Authorities did not speculate on a possible motive.
   Kelly, an eighth-grader, was last seen entering the Golub house,
a few doors down from her home, in Valley Stream on March 3. Her
body was found in the basement there a day later.
   She had been stabbed with a World War I bayonet, strangled,
slashed, kicked and punched by her killer, authorities said. The
bayonet was recovered, Seay said.
   The Golub family, which had been staying with friends since
shortly after the killing, were cursed at and forced to leave after
they tried to return home Saturday night. Among the crowd of about
40 who screamed ``Monsters!'' and ``Seed of the devil!'' at the
Golubs were some of Kelly's relatives.
   The family, described by neighbors as remote, had lived in the
home for 11 years, while the Tinyes family had lived on the street
for 13 years.
   The slain girl's parents, Richard and Victoria Tinyes, stood
quietly in a courtroom hallway as Golub was arraigned Thursday.
   ``This defendant is charged with the vicious, savage killing of a
13-year-old girl,'' said Assistant District Attorney Daniel Cotter.
   ``It may not be the worst in the county's history, but it ranks
right up there,'' Cotter said. Nassau County Court Judge Marvin
Goodman accepted Cotter's request that Golub be held without bail,
pending a court appearance next Wednesday.
   Golub, an unemployed onetime truck driver, entered an innocent
plea through his attorney, John O'Grady.
   Seay said a bloody palm print that was found on a doorway near
Kelly's body was tentitively identified as belonging to Golub. The
FBI was analyzing it to confirm the identification.
   In the three weeks since the slaying, police checked a variety of
leads but ``We kept coming back to him (Robert Golub),'' Seay said,
adding the story the murder suspect told them shortly after the
slaying didn't check out.
   O'Grady said Golub maintained his innocence in the slaying on
Wednesday night when they discussed his pending surrender.
   ``What are you going to do? I didn't do it,'' the attorney quoted
Golub as saying.

<HEAD>Administration Consulting With Congress On Easing Aid Curbs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has asked Congress to
consider a partial lifting of the freeze on aid to Haiti, sources in
the State Department and on Capitol Hill said Thursday.
   The State Department is now consulting with Congress about the
timing of such a move in light of recent steps taken by Haiti's
military rulers to guarantee free elections, said the officials, all
of whom requested anonymity.
   The United States suspended $78 million in aid to the government
of the impoverished Caribbean nation in November 1987 to protest a
massacre that disrupted elections. The United States left in place
about $25 million in aid to private Haitian groups for health,
education and other humanitarian projects.
   The State Department's proposal would give the Haitian government
about $8 million worth of wheat that had been held up by the aid
suspension, said a congressional source. The government would be
allowed to sell the wheat and use the proceeds to create badly
needed jobs, he said.
   ``The sentiment here is to wait a while and see if President
(Prosper) Avril follows through on his promises for elections,''
said the source.
   ``We're not that far apart from the administration on this. It's
a question of timing,'' he added.
   Avril, who assumed power in a September 1988 coup, promised last
month to set up a nine-member electoral council to fix an election
date and set conditions for the balloting.
   A State Department source said that if Avril follows through on
his promise and names the commission in the coming days, Congress
may agree to ``reward him with a small amount of that aid.''

<HEAD>Judge Received Hundreds of Letters About Steinberg's Punishment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Adoptive parents, childless couples and people
abused as children wrote hundreds of letters urging a judge to give
Joel Steinberg maximum punishment for beating his illegally adopted
daughter to death, sources said Thursday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said people from
all over the country wrote to state Supreme Court Justice Harold
Rothwax, the judge who will sentence Steinberg on Friday.
   When asked to make the letters public, the judge said any letters
received in the case already had been destroyed.
   The sources said letters also came from child advocacy groups and
domestic violence projects, including a Georgia organization
responsible for a writing campaign of more than 100 letters.
   Not one of the letters recommended mercy for Steinberg, the
sources said, and some demanded the death penalty, which New York
does not have.
   Steinberg, 47, was convicted Jan. 30 of first-degree manslaughter
in the November 1987 beating death of 6-year-old Lisa.
   A disbarred lawyer, Steinberg got the child at birth from an
unwed teen-ager and raised her as his own rather than arranging for
the baby's adoption as he had promised.
   Steinberg was acquitted of a more serious charge of second-degree
murder. The maximum sentence he faces is eight and one-third to 25
years in prison.
   If Steinberg is sentenced to the maximum, he would be eligible
for parole in less than seven years because he already has been
jailed for nearly 17 months since his arrest.
   Steinberg's lawyer, Perry Reich, said Steinberg will address the
court before sentencing.
   ``Joel wants the judge to assess his humanity to see his sorrow
at Lisa's death and to feel he is worthy of redemption,'' Reich
said. ``He's simply going to express himself as a human being.''

   A potentially unfavorable court decision to
New York City's Staten Island has the borough threatening to secede,
and New Jersey officials joked Thursday they would welcome their
neighbors across the water. ``An awful lot of people think it's part
of New Jersey already,'' said Carl Golden, a spokesman for Gov.
Thomas H. Kean.
   But Bob Huber, a spokesman for Borough President Ralph J.
Lamberti, said any talk of secession by New York City's smallest
borough remains premature. If the borough's nearly 400,000 residents
did leave New York City, it would be to form their own county and
not to join New Jersey, Huber said.
   ``We wouldn't consider New Jersey,'' Huber said, adding that
Lamberti commissioned a study two years ago that showed Staten
Island could be a self-sufficient body.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that New York City's Board
of Estimate violated the Constitution's one-person, one-vote
principle. The court upheld a lower court ruling that required the
city to develop a plan giving greater voting weight to larger
boroughs. Staten Island is by far the city's smallest borough.
   The board, which rules on issues ranging from land-use to sewage
rates, is comprised of the five borough presidents and the mayor,
comptroller and City Council president. The latter three each have
two votes.
   Huber said the borough would await a decision by the Charter
Review Commission, appointed by Mayor Edward I. Koch to revise city
policy after the lower court decision.
   ``Do we want a board overwhelmingly made up of people who don't
live here?'' Huber asked. ``That wouldn't be fair.''
   Golden said with a laugh that he did not want New Jersey accused
of pirating an entire borough.
   ``It would be nice to get another member for the congressional
delegation,'' Golden said. ``If they want to join New Jersey,
they're more than welcome.''
   Just across a small body of water from Staten Island is the
township of Woodbridge, a popular place for the New York City
residents, according to Mayor Joseph DeMarino. Many Staten Islanders
work in Woodbridge and use the large mall there as a place to shop.
   But DeMarino said he doesn't expect the two groups to share the
same state name any time soon.
   ``I don't think anybody's talking about coming over to New
Jersey,'' he said. ``You know, secession's not as easy as it
sounds.''

<HEAD>Paper Says Entrepreneurs Arm Employees Against Criminals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criminals are demanding protection money from new
profit-making cooperatives, police can't stop them and the workers
have begun arming themselves, Pravda reported Thursday.
   Those who operate the semi-private cooperatives must choose
between knuckling under or fighting back, the Communist Party
newspaper said. It quoted a police chief as saying: ``The population
is arming itself.''
   ``People are making guns and bombs right at work,'' said the
chief, who was not identified. ``And you know how they explain it?
Self-defense.''
   The Interior Ministry acknowledges that new economic
opportunities and social change introduced by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev have brought more crime.
   Pravda said the murder rate rose 14 percent last year and armed
robberies increased by more than 40 percent. Professional criminals
are multiplying in a ``renaissance of robber traditions,'' and
organized crime benefits from the new atmosphere, it said.
   The newspaper attributed almost 20,000 crimes in 1987-88 to 2,607
organized groups, of which 50 acted in ``deep conspiracy'' for more
than three years.
   Gangs have souped-up cars, computers, bugging devices and hidden
video cameras at their disposal, while police work with outdated
equipment and insufficient enthusiasm, the article said.
   Many cooperatives hire policemen away from the force to serve as
guards, Pravda declared, sometimes tripling their pay and providing
up to 34 vacation days a year.
   Organized crime also causes increased corruption in the justice
system, the party paper said.
   ``Underground millionaires and policemen, robbers and
prosecutors, judges and speculators, party workers and `godfathers'
often end up in the same boat together'' at conviction time, it said.
   Pravda criticized the revised criminal code now under
consideration. Although the new code would humanize the system, the
paper said, it would benefit criminals at the expense of their
victims.
   Changes in the code would provide more alternatives to prison
sentences, such as house arrest and community service, and reduce
the number of capital crimes.
   According to the Pravda report, police would not have a way to
arrest leaders of organized crime rather than those who merely
follow orders.
   It quoted a detective named Y. Myslovsky as saying ``our hearts
sank'' when he and other investigators learned of the new provisions.
   Cooperatives are open to extortion because framers of current
laws never dreamed enterprises in a communist state would produce
enough profit to make the protection racket worthwhile.
   Although police have formed anti-racketeering units and the law
is being revised, ``while you're all discussing new legislation
around here, I'm buying a gun,'' Pravda quoted a cooperative worker
as saying. ``The racketeers have driven me crazy, and the police
won't defend me,'' he said.
   Gorbachev introduced cooperatives to spur individual enterprise
and help fill gaps in poor state-run services and production of
consumer goods. Their prices are not set by the state, and many
cooperatives sell scarce items for high profits on which taxes are
comparatively low.
   They are praised for initiative but sometimes censured for buying
up goods meant for the general public. Cooperatives also have been
accused of developing their own rackets and bribing officials to get
permits and supplies.

<HEAD>Smith Bill Would Protect Logging Even If Owl Listed As Endangered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation aimed at ensuring that logging in
the Northwest would not be interrupted for at least five years even
if the spotted owl was listed as an endangered species was
introduced Thursday.
   Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., said the five-year period would allow
time for wildlife biologists to determine whether the owl, believed
to inhabit only ancient forests, was really threatened with
extinction.
   ``There is not enough evidence, at this time, to say whether the
owl is endangered,'' Smith said at a news conference.
   He said the legislation would not prohibit the owl from being
listed as an endangered species either by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service or a federal court, but would keep such a listing from
effecting timber sales.
   ``This is the most moderate kind of an answer to a difficult
situation,'' said Smith.
   The owl has become the focal point of an increasingly bitter
debate in the Northwest over protecting old-growth timber.
   Environmentalists have sought to have the bird listed under the
federal Endangered Species Act, while the timber industry has
insisted that such a designation could halt logging in vast areas of
the Northwest and result in the loss of thousands of jobs.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service had previsouly refused to list the
owl for protection, but a federal court in Seattle has given the
agency until May 1 to review its decision.
   A General Accounting Office report released last month concluded
that the agency's decision not to protect the bird was based more on
politics than on scientific evidence.

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday it has
a new 55-page handbook to help farmers, shippers and local
communities facing the loss of railroad service.
   Martin ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick Jr., head of the department's Office
of Transportation, said the handbook contains information on rural
rail assistance from a number of sources and summarizes regulations
as these apply to rail abandonments.
   ``Many of the light-density branch lines being cast off are
located in agricultural regions,'' he said. ``Without rail
transportation, the marketing options of local producers are
limited.''
   The topics include abandonments, alternatives to abandonment, and
guidelines for evaluating the possibility of small railroad
operations. Information is included for potential buyers who have
little or no railroad experience.
   Fitzpatrick said many, if not all, of the major railroad
companies have programs or plans for assisting in line sales. And
many of those have worked with rural communities and shippers to
explore ways of retaining rail service. This information is also in
the handbook, he said.
   Copies of the booklet are being sent to federal, state and local
organizations involved in rural railroad service assistance, he
said. A limited supply is available free of charge for general
distribution.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
rejected Thursday an appeal by the Air Line Pilots Association to
reconsider a decision by former Secretary James Burnley affecting
Eastern Airlines.
   Skinner said the fact that Burnley was negotiating for employment
with a law firm that represented Eastern at the time was not reason
enough to overturn Burnley's refusal to conduct a continuing formal
fitness investigation of the airline.
   The matter arose before the current Machinists' union strike
against Eastern which the pilots union is supporting. The pilots
were, however, involved in own contract negotiations with still have
not been settled.
   Skinner signed an order that said the union had not presented any
information that would justify reconsidering Burnley's decision in
December, just before his resignation to join the Washington law
firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp; Trowbridge.
   The department concluded that since the firm had not represented
Eastern in the fitness investigation proceedings, ``there was no
reason for Secretary Burnley to have recused himself, and therefore
no reason to reconsider Secretary Burnley's decision in that case.''
   The department had said Burnley disclosed his negotiations for a
job with the law firm to the department's ethics office, and an
ethics official told him there would be no ethical or legal problem
with him deciding the Eastern matter.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Thursday
accused Pakistan of ignoring its commitment not to interfere in
Afghanistan and said the Soviet Union will take firm steps to
protect its citizens in Kabul.
   In an interview with the official Tass news agency, Shevardnadze
said Moscow signed the Geneva accords in April with the United
States, Pakistan and Afghanistan only because the Kremlin believed
that outside interference, mostly from Pakistan-supported rebels,
``would be completely discontinued.''
   Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 under
the U.N.-mediated agreement after more than nine years of direct
involvement in a civil war that began with a communist coup in April
1978.
   Shevardnadze said that despite the Soviet pullout, the civil war
in Afghanistan continues to rage.
   ``In order to understand why, one should turn to the Geneva
agreements again. And then, one will see that the clause on ending
interference in Afghan domestic affairs has been completely ignored
by Pakistan,'' he told Tass.
   Shevardnadze said Pakistan had grossly violated the Geneva
agreement by allowing the creation of an interim government on its
territory, known as ``the Alliance of Seven.''
   He said the agreement also specifically prohibits arms being
delivered to Afghan rebels. Most of the weapons have come from the
United States via Pakistan.
   ``I shall note again that if weapons were delivered not via
Pakistan, then, speaking from the legal viewpoint, there would be no
violation of the Geneva accords,'' Shevardnadze said. ``But, the
matter is that practically all the armaments are supplied from
Pakistan.''
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union was fully prepared to
discontinue arms shipments to Afghanistan, ``but we will not agree
to unilateral steps.''
   He said fierce fighting was raging outside the city of Jalalabad
but said Afghan forces were repelling the rebels.
   Shevardnadze also said a large number of Soviet civilian
specialists remained in Kabul as well as the staff of a large
embassy. ``Any attempts to encroach upon their security will draw a
most resolute Soviet response,'' he said without elaboration.

<HEAD>Soviet Condemns NATO Plan to Modernize Missiles, Looks for New Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin on Thursday
assailed NATO's plan to modernize its short-range nuclear missiles
as an unacceptable impediment to the improvement of East-West
relations.
   Dubinin, at a news conference, also said he hoped a date would be
set for the resumption of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce
long-range nuclear missiles when Secretary of State James A. Baker
III visits Moscow in May.
   ``We are ready,'' Dubinin said.
   The NATO plan to extend the range of U.S. Lance missiles is
running into obstacles even within the ranks of the Western
alliance. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with support from some
other allied leaders, is seeking a delay.
   The United States is determined to go ahead but still has to
persuade Kohl,whose chance for re-election next year may hinge on
the missile issue in a country where disarmament forces are strong.
   Congress, meanwhile, is unlikely to fund the modernization with
West Germany on the fence.
   Asked about improving the Lances, Dubinin said: ``It's
unacceptable, at any rate, not for the Soviet Union but for the
process we are talking about. It's just something which is going
against the mainstream of peaceable development of the world. It's
something which goes against the process of disarmament.''
   Dubinin added: ``There's absolutely no need to do it, because we
have begun in Europe a historic process of reducing forces,
unilaterally by the Soviet Union and multilaterally in
negotiations.''
   In any event, he said, the Soviet Union will not modernize its
own battlefield nuclear weapons. ``We are strongly in favor of
beginning negotiations to eliminate this class of weapons, too.''
   Apart from the Lance missile issue, Dubinin fielded questions
about U.S.-Soviet relations in a way that reflected a warming trend
in Moscow under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He said the Soviet leader probably would see Baker when he goes
to Moscow in the first half of May to hold a second meeting with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Dubinin described Baker's first talk with Shevardnadze, which was
held March 7 in Vienna, as ``a successful one'' and ``the beginning
of a new, active period of Soviet-American relations.''
   U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles
were tentatively scheduled to resume in mid-February in Geneva. But
President Bush ordered a postponement and the administration is
reviewing U.S. policy.
   Asked if the delay set back prospects for a treaty, Dubinin said:
``The delay is a delay. It's absolutely clear. But we understand the
new administration needs some time to get things together. It's
understandable.''

   Rubella has almost vanished in the United States
since a vaccine was licensed 20 years ago, but federal health
officials said they are concerned over the large proportion of the
remaining cases that may occur among women of childbearing age.
   Although the main symptom of rubella, also known as German
measles, is a mild rash, if it attacks pregnant women it can cause
serious birth defects.
   During the last major rubella epidemic, in 1962-64, there were
12.5 million cases reported in the United States, including 20,000
babies born with the disease and 11,000 fetal deaths.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said people 15 and over
accounted for 58.2 percent of all U.S. rubella cases from 1985-87.
The statistics did not indicate how many of those rubella cases
occurred among women.
   There was one case of congenital rubella syndrome reported in
1988, according to the CDC, but three already have been reported
this year.

   International health officials have recommended
that the influenza vaccine used in the 1989-90 season add three new
components.
   The World Health Organization has recommended that next year's
flu vaccine contain protection against the flu types known as
A(H3N2), A-Shanghai and B-Yamagata. It said the type A(H1N1)
component of the current vaccine should be retained.
   The CDC said its immunization committee will make specific
recommendations for a U.S. vaccine later this spring.

   Researchers are using radio waves to treat
patients with uncontrolled rapid heartbeats, a method they say is
safer and less painful than other techniques.
   Radio wave energy can be applied to the heart in smaller, more
controlled doses than electricity, doctors say, slowing rather than
cutting the cardiac electrical connection that causes rapid
heartbeats, allowing certain patients to escape the need for
pacemakers.
   The method destroys offending heart tissue with only 30 to 40
volts of energy and can be done with local anesthetic. Researchers
also said the radio wave technique is safer than an older method of
electrical shock because it doesn't reset the heart's electrical
activity or risk burning a hole in the heart.
   The research was reported during the American College of
Cardiology's annual meeting, which ended Thursday.

   A study suggests accident proneness in children
appears to be a phase, rather than a long-term characteristic,
raising the possibility that injuries can be prevented by
identifying susceptible youngsters.
   Researchers studied 54,874 school children ages 6 to 18 over a
three-year period in an Arizona school district during school hours
and recorded 8,429 injuries. Seventeen percent of the injuries
occurred to 1 percent of the children, a significantly higher rate
than could be expected from chance alone. Injuries were most likely
to recur among junior high school boys, children engaged in athletic
activities and youngsters attending schools with longer hours or who
were engaged in alternative programs, such as ``open'' classrooms or
``magnet'' curricula, the researchers said.
   The researchers was published in the March issue of the American
Journal of Diseases of Children.

   An end to cocaine use during the first three
months of pregnancy can reduce odds that the baby will suffer
physical damage, but does not appear to reduce the risk of
neurological problems, a study says.
   Between Jan. 1, 1986 and Feb. 2, 1988, researchers studied 125
women: 52 who used cocaine throughout their pregancy, 23 who stopped
using the drug during the first trimester and 40 with no history or
evidence of drug use.
   Many babies born to women in the second group escaped physical
problems found in those whose mothers used cocaine until delivery.
   But babies whose mothers were in either of the cocaine-use groups
suffered significant neurobehavioral response deficiencies. In
addition to lack of responsiveness and alertness, researchers found
impairments in orientation, motor ability and ability to regulate
behavior.
   The study was published in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.

<HEAD>Argentine Navy Ends Oil Spill Cleanup Efforts, Claims No Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deteriorating weather has forced the Argentine
navy to halt efforts to clean up a fuel oil spill from a ship that
went aground Jan. 28 near an American Antarctic research station.
   A statement released Thursday by the Argentine Embassy said that
five Argentine naval ships that had been participating in
contamination control work were being withdrawn ``due to glacier and
meteorological conditions.''
   The statement said that oil spilled from the Argentine supply
ship Bahia Paraiso has been removed from the sea surface and that
all ``potential pollutants'' have been removed from the wrecked ship.
   American experts, however, say about 50,000 gallons of fuel oil
are still aboard the Bahia Paraiso and National Science Foundation
spokesman Jack Talmadge said that ``there has never been ship with
oil in it that withstood an Antarctica winter.''
   ``We're concerned about what might happen over the winter,'' he
said.
   The Bahia Paraiso lodged on rocks on DeLaca Island near the
Palmer station and dumped about 170,000 gallons of diesel and jet
fuel into the pristine waters nearby. An American research camp
called Palmer Station is 1.1 miles away.
   Experts from the United States and Argentina stopped further
leaks from the vessel and cleaned up much of the oil, but the
Argentine navy now is leaving the scene while tons of fuel remain in
the Bahia Paraiso tanks.
   Talmadge said the vessel could quite likely be susceptible to
shifting by the force of ice and tide through the winter.
   The approaching Antarctic winter will not halt American efforts,
Talmadge said, because the NSF icebreaker Polar Duke is able to
operate out of Palmer Station in virtually all seasons.
   The Argentine statement also claimed that ``no visible harm to
the local ecosystem was noticed, especially with respect to its
fauna.''
   But experts at the National Science Foundation, which operates
the U.S. research program in the region, said that the spill of fuel
oil from the Bahia Paraiso did cause some loss of wildlife in the
area near Palmer Station, and that the eventual impact of the spill
may not be known for years.
   An extra team of American scientists went to Palmer Station
earlier this month to conduct new studies on the effects of the fuel
oil spill. They are expected to return in April.
   NSF scientists have been monitoring the effects of the spill
since the ship first went aground and have reported:
   _Among a population of 30,000 birds of at least eight species,
fewer than 30 are known to have died directly as a result of
ingesting the fuel oil. However, there is indirect evidence of other
losses.
   _Penguins returning to the sea after nesting were forced to swim
through oil-covered water. Some penguins now are apparently being
eaten at sea by giant petrels, a long-winged bird. ``This diet,
unusual for petrels, is evidence that the oil spill affected
penguins,'' an NSF statement says.
   _An entire generation of South Polar skuas died in one rookery
near Palmer Station. The skua is a gull-like bird of prey. NSF
experts said skua parents were apparently affected by the oil spill
and failed to protect their nestlings from other skuas and other
predatory birds. There are, however, many skua rookeries in the
South Polar region.
   _The loss most feared by scientists is that the area around
Palmer Station, which has been a science outpost for 20 years, may
no longer be suitable for study because of distortions caused by the
oil spill. ``The usefulness of ... Palmer Station for basic research
(of) the undisturbed Antarctic ecosystem is in question,'' an NSF
statement said.

<HEAD>Prominent Women Back Hedda Nussbaum, Say Compassion Needed For Abuse
Victims</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Steinberg</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prominent women from Gloria Steinem to Martina
Navratilova to Geraldine Ferraro say they are worried about a
backlash against Hedda Nussbaum from those who believe she shares
the blame for the death of Lisa Steinberg.
   ``Blaming victims will not save their lives,'' says a statement
they signed along with actresses Roseanne Barr and Colleen Dewhurst,
singer Judy Collins, writer Joyce Carol Oates and some 300 others.
   Organizers planned to present the statement Friday when Joel
Steinberg is sentenced for first-degree manslaughter in the death of
6-year-old Lisa, the girl he raised with his battered companion, Ms.
Nussbaum.
   Lisa, who was illegally obtained at birth by Steinberg from an
unwed teen-ager, was removed comatose from the couple's apartment on
Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three days later.
   Prosecutors originally charged both Steinberg and Ms. Nussbaum in
the death, but later dropped charges against the woman when they
concluded she was too badly battered herself to have saved the
child. Ms. Nussbaum has been hospitalized for physical and mental
problems for most of the time since Lisa's death, and she became a
key witness against Steinberg at his trial.
   ``We're concerned about the rising backlash ... which says Hedda
Nussbaum got away with something,'' said novelist Lois Gould, who
drafted the statement in the face of controversy over Ms. Nussbaum's
role.
   Ms. magazine carried a a variety of views on the dispute in its
April edition, including an essay by author Susan Brownmiller, who
said, ``Many of us old-warrior feminists who followed the case from
the beginning thought that Nussbaum should have been standing trial
as well, for reckless endangerment of a child, at least.''
   Those who signed the statement argued that whether or not Ms.
Nussbaum was culpable, the controversy could divert attention from
battered women who genuinely need help.
   ``I got into an argument with a woman defense lawyer and two
female judges about this. Even these people, who should know better,
don't understand that Hedda Nussbaum was a victim,'' said Ms.
Ferraro, the former congresswoman and vice presidential candidate.
   ``We don't know how to deal with these women yet,'' said Ms.
Ferraro, who prosecuted both child abusers and wife-beaters when she
was an assistant district attorney. ``They are all people who have
been preyed upon and who find themselves in a situation they cannot
get out of; they are generally misunderstood.''
   The statement says the Steinberg case ``has forced open the door
between family violence and our conscience as a civilized society.''
   It calls for help for women to escape family violence; methods to
stop men from beating women and children; and acknowledgement of the
``enormous social and economic toll'' of domestic violence. It said
women and children fleeing violence account for 40 percent of the
city's homeless.
   ``This letter is done to remind people there are very few escape
hatches for women who try to flee: no funding, few services,'' said
Phyllis Chesler, a psychologist and author.
   ``Rather than blame one woman because we may disagree with her,
(the letter) reaffirms the larger point: Our duty is to protect
women and children from being battered and help them escape, rather
than to discuss, `In what ways is she really to blame?'' Ms. Chesler
said.

   Guerrillas blew up a bridge on the only
paved road to Jalalabad, the government said Thursday. The bombing
disrupted supplies to the city the guerrillas chose as their first
major objective after the Soviet withdrawal.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said three other roads, all unpaved
and more circuitous, remained open to military convoys between Kabul
and the strategic city 75 miles to the east near the Khyber Pass.
   Mohammad Nabi Amani told reporters the bridge near Sarobi, about
midway between the capital and Jalalabad, was destroyed Tuesday by
explosives planted on the span. He said the bridge was one of about
100 on the paved highway.
   Moslem insurgents based in Pakistan and supported by the United
States launched their offensive around the eastern city March 6 but
have not succeeded in dislodging government troops.
   Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement, after more than nine years of direct
involvement in a civil war that began with a communist coup in April
1978.
   Kabul's airport is the terminus for military supplies from the
Soviet Union, which the Kremlin-sponsored government says will
continue arriving until the United States stops supplying the
guerrillas.
   Amani said the guerrillas fired 2,000 rockets and artillery
shells at government positions outside Jalalabad in the previous 24
hours.
   No government soldiers were killed, but five troopers and five
civilians were wounded, he said. He claimed 89 guerrillas, including
four local commanders, were killed in the same period.
   Amani repeated his government's claims that Pakistani military
personnel were aiding the insurgents, who call themselves
mujahedeen, or holy warriors. Pakistan, Afghanistan's neighbor to
the east, has denied such involvement.
   In Moscow, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze accused
Pakistan of ignoring its commitment not to interfere in Afghanistan.
   He said Pakistan had grossly violated the U.N.-mediated agreement
by allowing the rebels to form an interim government on its
territory. He also charged that arms were being delivered to the
rebels from the United States via Pakistan in violation of the
accord.
   Shevardnadze noted a large number of Soviet civilian specialists
remained in Kabul as well as the staff of a large embassy. ``Any
attempts to encroach upon their security will draw a most resolute
Soviet response,'' he said without elaboration.
   In Pakistan, the Afghan News Agency operated by the Hezb-e-Islami
rebel group of Gulbaddin Hekmatyar claimed army outposts north and
west of the city were captured.
   Reports on casualties and the progress of fighting around
Jalalabad are impossible to verify from Kabul. Guerrilla
headquarters in Pakistan have reported far lower death tolls for the
mujahedeen.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said soldiers were conducting a
``mopping-up operation'' against insurgents near Khak-e-Jabbar, 15
miles southeast of the capital on one of the alternate routes to
Jalalabad.
   Blowing up the bridge could signal a change of mujahedeen tactics
in the 17-day-old battle for Jalalabad, which illustrates the
difficulty for guerrillas of direct confrontation with an army that
has air power and long-ange missiles.
   Soviet-made Scud-B rockets have been fired daily from Kabul in
the direction of Jalalabad since the battle bagan, according to
foreign observers and residents of Kabul. They have a range of at
least 175 miles.
   A truck hauled three Scuds tightly wrapped in gray plastic
through the center of the capital Thursday, accompanied by two other
trucks carrying canisters of fuel that must be attached to fire the
missiles.
   The trucks were seen on a major route from the airport, where
Soviet Ilyushin-76 transports land several times a day. The huge
planes can carry 40 tons of cargo.
   Thousands more Afghans have fled to Pakistan, further swelling a
refugee population estimated at about 3.5 million. Refugee officials
in Peshawar said most were from villages in the Jalalabad area, not
from the city.
   Guerrilla and other sources said the government imposed a 24-hour
curfew on Jalalabad to avert an exodus. Insurgent leaders said they
were reluctant to attack the city because of the civilian casualties
it would cause.

   President Bush is expected soon to name
William H. Taft IV, the deputy defense secretary, as the American
ambassador to NATO, a source said Thursday.
   Taft will replace Alton G. Keel Jr., who is leaving the post at
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to return to the United
States and a job in the private sector, the source said on condition
of anonymity.
   Keel will stay on the job through the summit to be attended by
Bush and other leaders of the 16 alliance nations May 29-30 at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
   Taft, the great-grandson of President William Howard Taft, has
been deputy defense secretary since February 1984. In that job, he
has visited the NATO countries for discussions on
``burden-sharing,'' the sensitive issue of how much the allies are
contributing to the common defense.
   Before being named to his current job, Taft, a lawyer, was the
Pentagon's general counsel.
   In the 1970s, he held positions in the Federal Trade Commission,
the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
   Keel was sworn in as the United States representative to NATO on
March 13, 1987. He had been acting assistant for national security
affairs under President Reagan.
   In 1981, Keel was named assistant secretary of the Air Force for
research, development and logistics. A year later, he was chosen
associate director for national security and international affairs
in the Office of Management and Budget.
   In 1986, he was executive director of the presidential commission
investigating the accident of the space shuttle Challenger.

   Officials criticized the British press Thursday
for disclosing a secret Federal Aviation Administration warning of a
potential hijacking in Europe, but relatives of air terrorism
victims said passengers have a right to know of such threats.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said release of the
warning compromises intelligence-gathering activities and
jeopardizes airline passengers' safety. ``Hopefully no one will lose
their life over this, but it is a very serious matter,'' he said.
   Skinner ordered the FAA and a team of top aides now in London to
investigate who leaked the warning to British news media.
   The Daily Express in London quoted from a copy of a March 16 FAA
security bulletin which warned of a possible hijacking of a U.S.
airliner during the upcoming Easter weekend.
   The FAA, which acknowledged issuing the bulletin after reports
about it appeared in the Express and other British media, said,
``The release of this information by unauthorized persons can be
counterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts to
provide a totally effective security system.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said it is necessary to
keep such bulletins secret to protect intelligence sources and,
ultimately, the public.
   Redman and other U.S. officials denied a Daily Express report
that it warned government employees against flying in Europe during
the Easter weekend.
   But several relatives of victims of the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland said they believe the way the government
handles terrorism bulletins has the effect of warning diplomatic and
military personnel while keeping other potential passengers
uninformed about risks.
   The relatives, in telephone interviews, criticized government
reluctance to provide the public with information about terrorist
warnings. British investigators have concluded that a terrorist bomb
concealed in a radio-casettee player blew up Flight 103, killing all
259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   ``We don't think they should use the American public as live
bait,'' said Colleen Hermann, of Huntington, N.Y., whose brother
John Michael Ahern was killed on Flight 103.
   Bert Ammerman, a spokesman for the relatives of Lockerbie
victims, said the group is not calling for general public
announcements everytime there is a terrorist threat.
   But he said until ``prudent security measures'' can be taken to
protect American carriers, a number should be set up for travellers
to call to get information on any threat against a flight they plan
to take.
   ``I don't think that's going to paralyze the aviation industry,''
said Ammerman, of Demarest, N.J., whose brother, Tom, was killed in
the Pan Am bombing.
   Another victim's relative, Paul Hodson, an Albany, N.Y., lawyer
who lost his 16-year-old daughter, Melina, said the present security
system amounts to a selective warning system.
   ``This whole thing gives us a feeling of deja vu,'' he said,
referring to the secret warnings passed around among government and
aviation officials before the Lockerbie explosion.
   ``What happens when this information is kept secret and yet is
passed around to literally thousands of security people is that it
is bound to leak out and hurt the credibility of security. It then
tends to sow panic even among those not directly threatened,''
Hudson said.
   Tim Cole, a Washington aviation consultant, said if all threats
were made public, they might become so commonplace that people would
simply ignore them. ``With 600 or so threats a year, you'd be crying
wolf all the time,'' he said.
   Officials say all but a handful of threats are hoaxes.
   Sherry Price, a consultant at the National Victims Center in New
York City, which works with victims of violent crimes, said fears
that warnings may disrupt commercial aviation are unfounded.
   ``They're not giving the American public the credit it
deserves,'' she said. ``People are still going to go on airplanes,
but I need to have the right to cancel my plans rather than cancel
my life.''

<HEAD>Two Armenian Nationalists Sent to Prison for Airport Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Armenian nationlists were sentenced Thursday to
18 months in prison for leading a strike that closed the Caucasus
republic's main airport in July, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   It said A. Gevoyan and A. Pogosyan, both unemployed, were charged
with inducing unlawful actions that closed Zvartnots airport for
three days.
   Evidence was given during the two-month trial that the men, in
Civil Aviation uniforms, urged people at a mass meeting of the
banned Karabakh Committee to march on the airport and force the
staff to strike.
   ``The demonstrators, arriving at Zvartnots airport, blocked the
approaches to the airport and the buildings of the air terminal,''
Tass said. ``Takeoffs were prevented and the airport's functions
were paralyzed, jeopardizing the safety of numerous airliners.''
   An Ilyushin-86 airbus carrying 300 people was able to land safely
``only by a lucky chance,'' the agency reported.
   According to the evidence, the defendants directed the three-day
demonstration and strike. Tass said they ``ignored all the efforts
of airport authorities, of representatives of party and government
bodies to persuade them to end the blockage of Zvartnots airport.''
   ``Instead of that, the demonstrators' leaders continued to make
absurd demands and threatened to take hostages,'' the news agency
said. ``It is only due to the intervention of forces protecting law
and order that the dangerous developments were disrupted.
   ``The defendants have been sentenced to the deprivation of
freedom for 18 months and are to serve the term in a correctional
labor colony with a general regime.''
   Tass said the sentence cannot be appealed.
   The Karabakh Committee began a campaign in February 1988 to annex
Nagorno Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave in neighboring
Azerbaijan. At least 87 people died in ethnic riots and efforts by
Soviet troops to quell violence between the Christian Armenians and
the Moslem Azerbaijanis.

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police clashed with ethnic Albanian
demonstrators in the province of Kosovo on Thursday after the local
legislature approved constitutional changes that will weaken the
region's autonomy.
   Police used tear gas and clubs to disperse up to 10,000
stone-throwing protesters in Urosevac, a town about 15 miles south
of Pristina, witnesses and the state-run media reported.
   Belgrade radio said ``several'' police officers and demonstrators
were injured. Witnesses said at least 100 demonstrators were
detained.
   About 2,000 university students in Pristina tried to stage a
similar protest, but riot police forced them back onto their campus.
   The ethnic Albanians were protesting the adoption of amendments
designed to give the country's largest republic of Serbia greater
control over the affairs of the southern province of Kosovo. Most of
Serbia's people are Christian and Slavic, and most people in Kosovo
are Moslem and ethnic Albanian.
   The demonstrators in Urosevac chanted, ``We will give our lives,
but we will not give up Kosovo,'' the state news agency Tanjug
reported.
   Of 188 deputies at the parliamentary session, only 10 voted
against the constitutional changes and two abstained from the
voting, conducted by a show of hands, Tanjug said.
   About 80 percent of the deputies are ethnic Albanians, and it
appeared they voted for the changes in response to pressure from the
national government.
   More than 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated last November in
Pristina, the province's capital, and thousands walked off their
jobs in February to protest the proposed amendments.
   Yugoslavia's federal presidency last month imposed a partial
state of emergency in the province by banning all public gatherings
and issuing ``compulsory work orders,'' which carry the weight of a
call to reserve military duty.
   At least a dozen prominent ethnic Albanians, including Kosovo's
former Communist Party leader Azem Vlasi _ a bitter political rival
of Serbia's party boss Slobodan Milosevic _ were arrested in the
past month on suspicion of instigating protests.
   Hundreds of police officers, including heavily armed riot squads
with police dogs, patrolled Pristina's streets during the
parliamentary session Thursday.
   About 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million residents are ethnic
Albanian. A majority has opposed any moved to restrict the wide
autonomy granted to the region by the 1974 federal constitution.
   The constitutional changes allow tighter control by Serbia over
the province's judiciary and police. They also make it unnecessary
for Kosovo's parliament to approve amendments to the Serbian
constitution that affect the province.
   Previously, any changes to the Serbian constitution had to be
approved by the legislatures of Serbia, Kosovo and the republic's
other autonomous province, Vojvodina.
   Serbian authorities have maintained the constitutional changes
are necessary to protect Kosovo's Slavic minority, which they say is
harassed and forced to leave the region by ethnic Albanians.
   Ethnic Albanians have countered that Slavs are emigrating from
the province because of the region's severe economic problems, which
include a 30 percent unemployment rate.
   They also have expressed fears that by taking away Kosovo's power
to approve changes to the Serbian constitution, authorities could
restrict such rights as the use of the Albanian language in official
matters and education.

   Rebels in Sudan have promised a U.N. famine
relief effort safe passage to rebel-controlled areas where hundreds
of thousands of people face starvation, a U.N. official said
Thursday.
   ``Operation Lifeline,'' the biggest effort of its kind in any
developing nation, aims to deliver more than 100,000 tons of food to
more than 1 million people in April, which has been designated a
month of tranquillity in Sudan's civil conflict.
   The object of the operation is to deliver the food by train,
truck, barge and air to remote areas in the south before seasonal
rains and floods make transport routes impassable.
   The cost of the project is $132 million, $55 million of which
still must be raised.
   U.N. officials have said more than 600,000 of the 2 million to 3
million people displaced by the civil war could die of starvation
during the April-December rainy season unless they get help.
   James P. Grant, director of the U.N. Children's Fund, said at a
news conference that the Sudan People's Liberation Army has promised
safe passage to rebel-controlled areas in the south.
   He said both sides agreed to the presence of U.N. staff to assure
international donors that the supplies are being used for the
purposes intended.
   Also Thursday, Grant was appointed personal representative of
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for relief in Sudan.
   Grant held talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with Sudanese rebel
officials on allowing the relief convoys and airlifts, which already
have started.
   He said they had indicated their acceptance of ``corridors of
peace'' to allow transport of relief supplies.
   The rebels are fighting for more autonomy for the Christian and
animist south from the Moslem-controlled government.

   Randall Dale Adams went home a free man Thursday,
meeting his family minutes after a prosecutor announced he will not
retry the man who was once three days away from execution for the
1976 killing of a Dallas policeman.
   ``I've been standing a twilight zone for the past 12{ years,''
Adams said after hearing the news. ``I was in that twilight zone
until the door opened. Thank God it did.''
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said the case was
dropped because there is not enough evidence to retry Adams, who has
served 12{ years in prison. A judge ordered his release two days ago
on grounds his first trial was unfair.
   ``It's almost impossible to find sufficient, credible evidence to
try a case that is 13 years old,'' Vance said.
   Adams was convicted and sentenced to die in 1977 for the murder
of Dallas police officer Robert Wood, a crime to which another man
has virtually confessed.
   The one-time drifter has unstintingly maintained his innocence.
His case drew national attention after it was portrayed in the movie
documentary ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   Vance announced his decision as Adams was en route to Ohio to
rejoin his family. He is free on a $50,000 personal recognizance
bond.
   In Columbus, Ohio, Adams walked off an airplane and kissed his
mother, Mildred Adams. Both broke into tears. About 100 friends and
well-wishers were at the airport to greet him.
   ``You're supposed to have a resurrection around Easter,'' Mrs.
Adams said. ``I guess this is it.''
   Errol Morris, director of ``The Thin Blue Line,'' had to battle a
contingent of reporters and photographers to get close to Adams. He
and Adams then embraced.
   Adams, who appeared red-faced and grimacing as he got off the
plane before hearing the news, was given an Ohio State University
cap and a lei made of daffodils. He then was taken to a private room
in the airport.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in March threw the conviction
out, saying Adams hadn't gotten a fair trial because prosecutors
suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on the stand.
   Adams, who was three days away from execution before his sentence
was commuted in 1980 to life in prison, has repeatedly said he'd
welcome a second trial.
   His attorney, Randy Schaffer of Houston, said Vance's action
served the purpose.
   ``I think he (Adams) would probably agree with me that his name
has been cleared, that he's been vindicated in the court
proceedings,'' Schaffer said.
   He said he believes the national spotlight on the case probably
forced Vance to drop it. But Vance defended prosecutors' actions,
including a legal fight that temporarily held up Adams' release
earlier this week.
   ``The easy route would have been to release Mr. Adams
immediately. However, my obligation is not to the media or to play
the part of the hero. My responsibility in every case is to the
victim, his family, Dallas County citizens and the state of Texas,''
Vance said.
   ``I think Mr. Adams would be the first to admit to you that the
justice system works. If it didn't he would be on death row.''
   Vance said a motion to dismiss the capital murder charge has been
filed with state District Judge Larry Baraka, who initially
recommended that Adams be retried.
   Pressure to re-examine the case grew after ``The Thin Blue Line''
raised doubts about the testimony of the state's key witness, David
Harris.
   Harris had picked up Adams the day of the shooting after Adams'
car ran out of gas. In the first trial, Harris said Wood had pulled
over Harris' car and Adams shot the officer.
   In the documentary, however, Harris changed his story. And in
December he told Baraka that Adams did not shoot Wood. Harris
provided so many details of the crime that the judge said he
considered Harris' testimony a virtual confession.
   Harris is on death row for another slaying but wasn't charged in
the Wood case.
   The district attorney previously said his decision on whether to
retry would hinge on prosecutors' ability to find two key witnesses
_ a woman investigators had not spoken with in 13 years and a man
who identified Adams, but later claimed he had forgotten his
original testimony.
   Vance said Thursday he doesn't believe Harris confessed, and he
doesn't expect him to be tried for the Woods killing.
   Detective J. Copeland of the Dallas Police Crimes Against Persons
Division said the case probably will not be reopened. Most of the
officers who worked on the 1976 shooting have retired or left the
force, he said.
   ``It's just too bad they can let a guy out because somebody makes
a movie that isn't right,'' Copeland said. ``They (prosecutors) know
best if they have a triable case or not. In this business you have
to roll with the punches.''

<HEAD>FSX Questions Still Unanswered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senior Bush administration and Japanese
officials met Thursday to discuss the controversial FSX fighter
after the chief White House spokesman declared that the joint
production arrangement is ``not a done deal.''
   ``The president still has to make the basic decisions,'' press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   President Bush had said he wants to proceed with the deal, but
with modifications to help safeguard U.S. technology and to assure
that American industry has a share in the plane's production.
   ``We've pretty much finished our deliberations here inside the
administration. I've made my decision to go forward, with certain
clarifications,'' Bush said at that time.
   Fitzwater announced that Japanese officials would be meeting
later with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft to
present their views on revisions being proposed by the
administration.
   The Japanese government has called for U.S. approval of the
original plan negotiated by the Reagan administration with as few
changes as possible.
   Japanese officials in the meeting at the State Department
included Vice Minister Seiki Nishihiro of the Japanese Defense
Agency and Nobuo Matsunaga, the Japanese ambassador to Washington.
   After the talks, Matsunaga brushed past reporters to a waiting
limousine, saying only: ``We agreed to continue meeting. I have
nothing else to say.''
   A State Department official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said the talks woill resume Friday.
   ``There is no conclusion, but there is no breakdown either,'' he
said.
   The FSX deal is expected to be sent to Capitol Hill within the
next few days. It could be blocked if both the Senate and the House
pass resolutions of disapproval within 30 days of being formally
notified of the agreement.
   The president, however, could then veto the congressional action,
with a two-thirds majority required to override the veto.
   Under the agreement signed late last year, St. Louis-based
General Dynamics would join with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
to co-develop and co-produce the FSX as an advanced version of the
U.S. F-16 fighter.
   Proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the
United States could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to
buying F-16s directly from this country. They say the deal will
promote exchanges of technology while helping U.S. industry.
   Critics contend the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of advanced
technology that Japan may use to help propel its civilian aircraft
industry into head-to-head competition with the United States in the
world market. They say Tokyo should purchase American-made planes to
help offset the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   On Capitol Hill, a group of seven House members led by Rep. Mel
Levine, D-Calif., circulated a ``dear colleague'' letter saying they
continue to have ``serious reservations'' about the FSX deal.
   ``If the Japanese were serious about improving the defense of the
northern Pacific, increasing their share of the defense burden and
reducing their massive trade surplus with the United States, they
would buy these planes directly from us.
   ``Instead, they are getting U.S. technology on the cheap to
develop their own aerospace industry _ an industry which could
someday become a major competitor of its U.S. counterpart in
advanced commercial aviation and space launch vehicles,'' the letter
said.
   Also signing the letter were Reps. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., House
majority whip; Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the House Ways and
Means subcommittee on trade; Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., chairman of
the House Trade and Competitiveness Taskforce; Robert T. Matsui,
D-Calif.; Norman Mineta, D-Calif., and Marvin Leath, D-Texas.

<TEXT>
   Some European airports stepped up security after
receiving a U.S. warning of a possible hijacking, but others
reported business as usual on a busy Thursday.
   Authorities in London, Frankfurt, Rome and Brussels said security
had been tightened at airports because of the alert, but no
additional precautions were reported in Paris, Amsterdam, Athens or
Madrid.
   The U.S. Embassy in London confirmed the Federal Aviation
Administration had issued an alert about a possible attempt by
radical Palestinians to hijack a U.S. airliner in Europe this
weekend.
   In West Germany, officials said the Interior Ministry and U.S.
government offices were notified of the threat but had issued no
warnings to the public.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Roland Bachmeier said Bonn
authorities received ``a vague warning'' but declined to give
details. He said his ministry regularly receives indications or
warnings of planned terrorist attacks and that security officials
routinely investigate them.
   In Washington, the White House played down the warning, saying it
was similar to many other terrorist alerts and travelers ``should be
confident that all reasonable precautions are being taken.''
   The alert was disclosed in several London newspapers, including
the Daily Express, which published a photocopy of part of the
warning it said had been received by International Aviation
Security, a subsidiary of Trans World Airlines.
   ``The public has been super. They understand the situation and
are very cooperative,'' said Barry Buttenshaw, assistant public
relations manager at London's Gatwick Airport, through which a
quarter-million passengers were expected to pass during the four-day
Easter weekend.
   Buttenshaw reported no flight delays because of stepped-up
security, and spokeswoman Roz Clark at London's Heathrow airport
also reported traffic moving smoothly Thursday afternoon.
   On Thursday morning, however, passengers waiting to board stood
in long lines waiting to be checked through security.
   Security staff ``were very thorough and searched everything we
were taking thorough, which we were pleased to see,'' said Alan Dean
of Boston, who was waiting for a flight at Heathrow.
   Authorities in Rome said security was tighter, but no special
precautions were reported in Paris, Madrid or Amsterdam.
   U.S. airline offices in Rome reported few cancellations.
   ``In fact, we are keeping tabs on this, but there have been no
unusual cancellations,'' said Daniela Travaglini of TWA's Rome
office.
   Rik Hirs, a Dutch national police spokesman, said the agency was
``looking into whether we can increase certain aspects of the
security situation here based on the alert we got.''
   In Athens, a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity
said ``security at the airport is always at a high state of alert.''
   The French government said it had received the warning but had
done nothing special about it. ``We do not wait for an FAA
communique to take measures,'' said an Interior Ministry spokesman.
   Nine people who work for Marshall Field's, the U.S. department
store, changed their Paris-to-Chicago bookings for Friday from
American Airlines to a foreign carrier, a Marshall Field's executive
said. They were in Paris for the ready-to-wear fashion shows that
just ended.
   Marshall Field's chairman Philip Miller made the decision, said
Ted Marlowe, merchandising vice president.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration and Congress reached
agreement Thursday on a Central America policy statement that would
renew aid to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and establish the first
broadly bipartisan approach to the region in years.
   ``There is a deal,'' said an administration official, speaking
only on condition of anonymity.
   ``I think they've come together,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
of the sides that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been
seeking to unite behind a new policy for the past several weeks.
   Baker and President Bush were expected to meet on the agreement
Friday morning, then announce the new policy in an appearance with
congressional leaders.
   The statement expresses support for Central American peace
efforts and democratic goals, calls for the ultimate reintegration
of the Contras into Nicaraguan political life and calls for an end
to regional hostilities.
   While it mentioned no specific figure for continued aid to the
rebels, money was to flow at the current rate of about $4 million a
month, putting the aid package at roughly $40 million.
   Thursday on Capitol Hill, Baker met first with House Democrats,
then with House Republicans, then with Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan. The Senate was in recess, and Dole was seeking to reach
key senators out of town to secure final agreement.
   Congressional leaders canceled other plans for Friday to be able
to appear at the White House.
   Meanwhile, however, Contra supporters said they were concerned
about an audit report detailing alleged killing, rape and torture of
prisoners captured by the Contras, and they called for changes in
the rebels' political directorate to ensure such abuses do not recur.
   The credibility of Contra leaders is at stake, said one lawmaker
who supports the rebels, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``They've got a lot of housecleaning they have to do.''
   Congressional sources, also speaking on condition they not be
named, said there was compelling circumstantial evidence that Contra
director Enrique Bermudez, also the Contra military commander, had
sought to cover up abuses or at least to prevent auditors from
finding out about them.
   The audit performed for the Agency for International Development,
which administers the aid currently flowing to the rebels in their
Honduran camps along the border with Nicaragua, turned up the
allegations during interviews late last year with 32 prisoners held
at Contra stockades.
   The agreement on the policy statement by a majority of
congressional Democrats and Republicans represented a sharp break
with the recent history of U.S. policy in Central America in general
and Nicaragua in particular. It was the most consistently
contentious foreign-policy subject during President Reagan's two
terms in office.
   The compromise policy statement would extend non-military aid to
the anti-Sandinista rebels through Feb. 28, 1990, after Nicaragua's
scheduled national elections. The idea is to keep the rebels in
place along the Nicaraguan border until they feel able to safely
return to their homeland or decide to voluntarily disband.
   The current $27 million aid package expires March 31.
   ``I do think the administration is legitimate on this,'' said
Obey, a severe skeptic of Reagan administration policy toward the
region.
   A key to the progress was insertion of a provision Obey proposed
that will allow any one of four congressional committees dealing
with foreign affairs to put an end to the aid at the end of
November, should lawmakers decide the Bush administration was not
adequately supporting regional peace efforts.
   Another provision stipulates that aid will end automatically
should the Contras engage in military attacks or cross-border
incursions, or evidence further human rights violations. The package
also says the aid money can be used for ``regional relocation'' of
the rebels.
   Obey said, ``Our expectation is that this will be in full support
of the Central American presidents'' who have been seeking to forge
a regional peace settlement, most recently at a February meeting in
El Salvador. Their agreement there called for establishing a plan by
mid-May to disband the 11,000-man Contra force and for the rebels to
be reintegrated into Nicaragua as political freedoms are
re-established.
   Much of the two-page U.S. policy statement, which had been
stamped ``Secret'' and kept under close wraps by Baker, consists of
broad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goals
for the region. Missing from the document are the kinds of harsh
denunciations of the Sandinistas that characterized Reagan
administration rhetoric.
   Lawmakers gave credit to Baker, a relative newcomer to the
foreign-policy field, for earning their trust by sitting through
long meetings with them, taking a non-ideological approach to the
talks and offering sincere pledges of good faith.
   ``There's no question that he wanted to find the center of
gravity and rest his policy on it,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,
a moderate Democrat who has been part of a group of ``swing'' voters
on Contra aid in the past. ``He has been trying to build a policy
based on political reality.''
   ``He offered statements that he is going to not only be a party
to make the agreements and peace accords work, but that he
personally would work against any secret military involvement,''
added Rep. Charles Stenholm, a conservative Texas Democrat.
   As for the audit on alleged torture by the Contras, it said
female prisoners between the ages of 15 and 25 reported being
``raped and tortured by (Nicaraguan resistance) officials at the
time of their detention so they would confess to being
infiltrators.''
   Male prisoners detained on suspicion of infiltration or sabotage
and spying also contended they had been tortured when they were
picked up and imprisoned in the log huts and barbed-wire enclosures,
and one prisoner was killed during interrogation.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said a rebel tribunal was
prosecuting at least one, and as many as four, suspects in the case,
and would mete out appropriate punishment. ``We think it is tragic,
lamentable,'' he said.

   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said Thursday
he will not call elections early, as the opposition and some others
have predicted.
   ``I am ruling out a July election,'' he said in a radio interview.
   Hawke has said he would let the government run its three-year
term until May 1990, but critics said his tearful admission on
television Tuesday that he had cheated on his wife of 33 years may
have been a bid for sympathy and votes.
   The 59-year-old Labor Party leader has won an unprecedented three
terms as prime minister and, in the past, has called elections early
despite asserting he would not.
   John Howard, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, suggested
last weekend that Hawke might call elections in July, 10 months
early.
   In the radio interview, his first public comment since the
television confession, Hawke said: ``The people that meet me are as
enthusiastic as they've ever been.''
   His approval rating has fallen to 48 percent, however, and a poll
published Wednesday indicated the Labor Party would have lost if
national elections had been held earlier this month.
   The tabloid Daily Mirror of Sydney speculated that the promise of
large tax reductions beginning July 1 indicate an election is coming.
   ``Political tacticians on both sides agree boosting the average
pay packet by at least $30 ($25 U.S.) a week will be electorally
advantageous,'' it said.
   Hawke is a former trade union leader who once was a heavy
drinker. His public admission of infidelity and his promise to stay
faithful were unexpected.
   Barry Cassidy, his press secretary, tried to counter the talk of
electioneering, and Clive Robertson, who interviewed Hawke on
television, said he thought the remarks were made off the cuff.

<HEAD>Peruvians Hope For End To Mail Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A postal strike that has held up millions of
letters from tax forms to love notes entered its 50th day Thursday,
but officials said it could end next week.
   ``For two months I have not received the check that my son sent
me from the United States. ... I am living on loans. I don't know
what else to do,'' said an elderly man waiting outside Lima's
central post office.
   He and dozens of others lined up in hopes that their mail somehow
got through.
   Jorge Perez, national mail director, told The Associated Press
that workers tentatively agreed to end their strike Monday, but the
National Federation of Postal Workers had not publicly agreed to a
settlement.
   Courier services such as DHL Worldwide Express said business has
surged since the strike began. Some people have gone into business
for themselves by placing newspaper ads offering to carry letters
for mailing in Miami for a $2 to $3 charge.
   Postal officials in Lima said there has been no home delivery
since the city's 570 letter carriers struck. A small number of other
postal workers remain on the job, but the mail flow, especially
arriving letters, has been reduced dramatically.
   Still, officials said, more than 10 million letters are piling up
in post offices in the city. Four storerooms in the central office
are filled to the ceiling with swollen mail pouches.
   The postal workers union struck Feb. 2 for higher wages to
counter inflation, which hit 110 percent during the first two months
of this year.
   The government decreed a 30 percent wage increase for public
employees earlier this month, but the union said the raise was
insufficient and continued the strike.
   Eugenio Medina, a 25-year postal veteran, said his current salary
_ equivalent to about $31 a month _ is barely enough to ``change the
soles of my shoes.''
   The inflation has combined with a 9 percent shrinkage of Peru's
economy last year to plunge the nation into its worst recession of
the century.
   There have been dozens of strikes, including walkouts by
telephone workers, bank employees, social security personnel and
Lima's morgue staff. Mine workers announced a tentative strike for
Monday.
   The government has argued that the wage increases demanded by
workers will only cause higher inflation and do little to boost
their spending power.
   Analysts say the weak economy and a relentless eight-year
insurgency by leftist guerrillas have undermined government
stability.
   President Alan Garcia began his five-year term in July 1985. His
center-left government cut inflation and sparked two years of growth
in 1986 and 1987 by using government dollar reserves to subsidize
imports of food and consumer and industrial goods.
   The economy began to falter late in 1987 when the reserves were
gone and the government continued its program despite a growing
budget deficit, considered the major cause of inflation.

   America's affluent households are becoming
richer while the poor are drifting ever deeper into poverty, says a
federal report that compared family incomes from 1973 through 1987.
   According to the study, released this week by the House Ways and
Means Committee, the wealthiest 20 percent of the nation's
households saw, on average, a 12 percent increase in income over the
15-year period, from $60,299 to $67,416.
   At the same time, the poorest fifth experienced an 8 percent
drop, from $5,507 to $5,107.
   ``This widening disparity between rich and poor, particularly for
families with children, is very disheartening,'' said Rep. Thomas
Downey, D-N.Y. and the chairman of the subcommittee on human
resources. ``These families are not even standing still. They are
losing ground.''
   The biggest reason for the poor becoming poorer, the report says,
was cuts in welfare programs. Aid to families with dependent
children was reduced over 30 percent during the period; food stamp
benefits and other social programs also were cut.
   An economist for the committee, who preferred not to be quoted by
name, said statistics also show that more jobs paid poverty-level
wages in 1987 than in 1979, midway through the survey period.
   He also pointed out that more families consist of never-wed
mothers and their children.
   While the total number of Americans under 18 years of age
decreased by about 800,000 from 1960 to 1987, from 63.7 million to
62.9 million, the number living with a never-married mother grew
from 243,000 to 4.2 million.
   Statistics also show that, after adjusting for inflation, 80
percent of all single working-mothers earned less in 1987 than in
1979.
   In families with both a mother and father raising children,
income among the poorest dropped 11.3 percent from 1973 to 1987,
from $14,038 annually to $12,796, the report said.
   The good news in the report is for the elderly who, married or
not, saw their incomes rise 20 percent to 30 percent, on average,
from 1973 to 1987.
   These increases were explained by rising Social Security benefits
and the fact that a greater portion of the elderly population
collected pensions in 1987 than in 1973, the report said.
   The years 1973, 1979 and 1987 were used in calculating incomes
for the study, ``Background Material and Data on Programs Within the
Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means,'' because they were
peak years within economic cycles.

   Two hundred anti-abortion activists waving
pictures of aborted fetuses were arrested as they blockaded a health
clinic Thursday in the first of a series of Holy Week protests that
have put police on alert.
   The arrests of the protesters and their 29-year-old leader,
Randall Terry, who was carried away in a fetal position, brought
cheers and applause from 150 pro-choice advocates outside the clinic
20 miles east of Los Angeles.
   The anti-abortion protesters organized by Operation Rescue, many
from out of state, clutched rosary beads, sang hymns and prayed as
they were arrested by police at the Family Planning Associates
Medical Clinic in suburban Cypress.
   Counterdemonstrators chanted ``Not the church, not the state,
women will decide our fate'' and hoisted ``Freedom of Choice'' and
``Keep Abortion Legal'' signs.
   The pro-choice people began gathering at 7:15 a.m. to counter
what New York-based Operation Rescue billed as its biggest
anti-abortion protest since undertaking blockades of clinics that
perform abortions two years ago.
   ``I just think somebody has got to do this. This is too big to
ignore. We need to do something for our voices to be heard,'' said
Sue Otti, one of those who tried to block Operation Rescue members.
   Southern California was targeted for the pre-Easter ``National
Week of Rescue,'' organizers said, because of its high abortion rate
and many clinics.
   The 400 anti-abortionists participating in the Cypress protest
sang the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and ``Jesus Loves the
Little Children.''
   The anti-abortion advocates refused comment. Terry, who had
displayed what he said was an aborted 19-week-old fetus in a small
white coffin at a Wednesday news conference, said he wouldn't make a
statement until the media shows pictures of aborted fetuses which
the activists usually display on posters.
   ``We do have a certain sense that media are not being fair with
this issue because a lot of the media has not explained adequately
the moral dilemma'' of equating a woman's right to have an abortion
to a fetus' right to live, said Lou Sheldon of Traditional Values, a
group representing 6,000 churches.
   The arrested were booked for investigation of failing to
disperse, a misdemeanor. Under Terry's order, they went limp during
arrests, requiring four police officers to drag each one to a bus
that took them to Cypress City Hall.
   At one point the pro-choice advocates tried to block
anti-abortion protesters who crawled to the clinic on hands and
knees to replace comrades who had been arrested.
   Later, the police used pro-choice advocates to help them escort
about 25 workers and abortion patients into the clinic as Operation
Rescue members shouted to one teen-age girl entering, ``Reconsider.
Keep your baby.''
   Calls to the clinic were referred to a Los Angeles office, where
a secretary said there would be no comment from management. However,
anti-abortion activists said the clinic's owner was Dr. Edward C.
Allred, a frequent target because he owns a number of clinics in the
area.
   Los Angeles officials who had expected protests by 2,500 people,
were on alert in a city command center four floors under City Hall.
   Police, fire and sheriff's officials kept tabs on activity at
clinics throughout Los Angeles County, including the Her Medical
Clinic near downtown, where 50 pro-choice advocates gathered.
   Operation Rescue members had vowed to risk arrest and defy a
federal court order obtained by the ACLU that forbid protesters from
blocking entrances or gathering within 15 feet of the clinic.
   In suburban Inglewood, police expecting protests there set up
Hollywood Park race track as a temporary jail site, but it wasn't
needed.
   The Operation Rescue protest was supported by Archbishop Roger
Mahony, head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.
   Pro-choice groups gathered as the Coalition for Safe and Legal
Abortion included the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California, the California Abortion Rights Action League, the
National Organization for Women and Hollywood celebrities, including
Christina Pickles of ``St. Elsewhere,'' who attended the Cypress
rally.
   Blockades were expected to continue through Saturday. Pro-choice
advocates vowed area clinics would remain open.
   The national Operation Rescue organization began its blockades
outside women's clinics in 1987 and since then, more than 21,000 of
its anti-abortion protesters have been arrested nationwide.

   ``Spets! Spets! Spets! Spets!'' Boris N. Yeltsin
rasped at a gathering of 1,000 workers, using Russian slang to
criticize the network supplying special food, consumer goods, cars
and drivers to Communist Party officials.
   His voice cracking from overuse, the former Communist Party boss
of Moscow demanded the privileges be eliminated. ``All of them have
to go,'' Yeltsin said.
   The workers applauded.
   Days before Soviets vote in the first multicandidate elections,
Yeltsin has become a lightning rod for people resentful of plenty
for a privileged few and empty store shelves for the rest.
   The election is Sunday, and Yeltsin is running against Yevgeny
Brakov, director of the ZIL plant that manufactures the ultimate
symbol of power and privilege: the shiny black ZIL limousine.
   Yeltsin received a warm welcome when he criticized official
privileges at Brakov's plant Tuesday in his drive to capture in a
popular election a seat representing all of Moscow. The word
``spets'' is a short form of the Russian word for special, as in
special privilege.
   Olga Ultiova, who joined a pro-Yeltsin demonstration in downtown
Moscow on Wednesday, praised him as the ``only one in 70 years of
Soviet power who did not take the privileges offered by his
position.''
   Yeltsin rallies, speeches and campaign posters are all over the
Soviet capital. The campaigning is an unprecedented sign of
political activity after years when Soviets dutifully went to the
polls to mark their ballots for the only choice available, the
candidate approved by party officials.
   The burly 58-year-old Siberia native has become an issue himself.
For or against, it is Yeltsin who voters are discussing.
   ``For me, Comrade Yeltsin is a real national hero,'' N. Barinov,
a disabled World War II veteran wrote to the Vechernaya Moskva
newspaper.
   But in a letter printed just above it, retiree I. Pidevich wrote
that a ``cult of personality'' already has begun to form around him.
``His personality is already covered by something that doesn't
correspond to reality, an unrealistic halo _ the basis of a cult.''
   Those are charged words in the Soviet Union. For more than 30
years ``cult of personality'' is the term by which Soviets have
referred to Stalin's reign of terror.
   It was Yeltsin's criticism of the party and warning that a cult
was developing around President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that got him
fired as Moscow party chief in November 1987.
   He charged into Moscow in late 1985 from the industrial city of
Sverdlovsk as Gorbachev's choice to take over from the corrupt city
administration of Viktor Grishin. He won admirers for his energetic
attacks on bureaucracy and food shortages, and was among the
strongest supporters of Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness.
   After his firing, Yeltsin went back to his original profession _
construction _ and was given a job as the first deputy chairman of
the State Construction Committee.
   That job has the status of a government minister, but nowhere
near the prestige. Yeltsin arrived at the ZIL plant in a black
Chaika _ a limousine, but a step below the status of the factory's
ZIL. He admits to accepting special health services and a country
home but says he turned down special food supplies, access to other
special stores and services.
   Yeltsin is no more popular now with the party hierarchy than he
was when he was accused of mistakes in his work as Moscow party
chief and being overly ambitious. But a Yeltsin victory would be
proof that under Gorbachev the party can tolerate diverse opinions.
   In an interview Thursday with the British Broadcasting Corp.,
Yeltsin said authorities had been trying to restrict his access to
the public during the campaign.
   Asked where the obstruction was coming from, Yeltsin said:
``First of all from the Moscow city authorities. But I think it has
the agreement ... perhaps not the agreement, but at least the
knowledge of the very top levels.
   ``It is clear that they don't want me to get elected,'' Yeltsin
said. ``They get together and they say we're not going to let
Yeltsin through. I suppose it's because I`m an awkward customer,
they don't know how to deal with me.''
   The maverick Communist says he recognizes Gorbachev as the Soviet
leader and does not intend to challenge him.
   ``From the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics, I
fully support him,'' Yeltsin said in February. ``From the viewpoint
of the strategy of internal politics, fully. From the viewpoint of
tactics, I have my own opinion.''
   Yeltsin says that is because the reforms haven't gone far enough.
   ``You may think this is a Utopia. I don't consider it Utopia,''
he told the voters.

   FBI agents who arrested an ex-cabinet minister of
Ferdinand Marcos have warrants to arrest five other ex-aides to the
ousted Philippines leader, but aren't expecting them to visit, a
federal agent said Thursday.
   A list prepared by Marcos aides for security guards at St.
Francis Medical Center showed that 11 former cabinet members were
expected to visit the ailing Marcos, who has been hospitalized since
Jan. 15 with heart and lung ailments.
   ``After what happened yesterday, we don't have any information
that they're still coming,'' said Ralph Girardi, assistant FBI
agent-in-charge in Honolulu. ``We don't have any absolute word that
they're not, but we're really not expecting them anymore.''
   Marcos aides said the former ministers' trips may be canceled.
   The arrested aide, Jaime Laya, who was head of the Philippines
Central Bank and later minister of education, was taken into custody
on a material witness warrant Wednesday at Honolulu International
Airport. He was ordered to appear May 8 in U.S. District Court in
New York.
   Girardi said material witness arrest warrants or subpoenas were
also issued for at least five others, including five of the six
former cabinet ministers scheduled to arrive in Honolulu Thursday or
Friday.
   Those who had been expected to visit Marcos were C.E.A. Virata,
former prime minister and finance minister; Manual Alba, former
budget director; Jesus Azurin, former health minister, Placido Mapa
Jr., former secretary general; and Geronimo Velasco, former energy
minister, Girardi said.
   The only scheduled guest who was not on the FBI's list was Ted
Pena, former director of Natural Resources, Girardi said.
   ``We may have just overlooked him,'' he said.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said Jose Rono, former minister
of local governments, visited Marcos Thursday, but U.S. authorities
didn't approach him.
   Rono came from Los Angeles, Trinidad said, and ``they probably
didn't know he was coming so they didn't get him.''
   ``Everyone who cleared their trip with (Philippine President
Corazon) Aquino was told `sure, go ahead,' then when they get here
they're greeted by the FBI,'' Trinidad said. ``It seems like there
is an intimate cooperation between the two governments when Mrs.
Aquino has said her government wouldn't interfere in the U.S.
matters.''
   Meanwhile, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos called Laya
``a poor guy (who) doesn't know anything about our business.''
   ``This is really something to happen in the United States, the
land of democracy,'' Mrs. Marcos told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin.
``He was only coming here to pay his respects to a dying man.
President Marcos' relationship with him was always very official.
   ``How very sad that a dying man can no longer have visitors,''
she said.
   Laya paid a $10,000 cash deposit on $100,000 bail Wednesday and
was forced to surrender his passport. He was released pending a
second bail hearing Friday to decide whether he can leave the United
States before his scheduled New York appearance.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, lead prosecutor in the
Marcos case, said Laya would not necessarily be held until May 8.
   ``He's important to the government's case and we want to make
sure he's here to testify at the government's main case,'' LaBella
said. ``It's calculated to make sure there's sufficient bail to
ensure his appearance at trial.''
   Laya was director of Marcos' budget office in the mid-1970s and
was later named Central Bank governor. He was forced to resign from
the Central Bank in 1984 after the discovery of an overstatement of
$600 million in the country's foreign exchange reserves.
   Despite criticism, Marcos then appointed Laya minister of
education, a post he held until Marcos was ousted in 1986.
   U.S. authorities said Laya earlier refused to talk to federal
prosecutors in New York and Manila.
   Marcos, accused of stealing more than $100 million from his
homeland and stashing much of it in the United States, remained in
guarded condition Thursday at St. Francis.
   Although Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and was
freed on $5 million bail, her husband's ill health has prevented his
arraignment.
   Four other visiting former aides _ Blas Ople, former minister of
labor; Estelito Mendoza, former minster of justice; Conrado
Estrella, former minister of agrarian reform; and Sylvia Montes,
former minister of social services _ have already received subpoenas
and were ordered to appear in court with Layas.

   The U.S. leader of a global ring that
laundered drug-linked profits by claiming they were Israeli
investments, at one point employing a Hasidic rabbi, was sentenced
to 52 months in prison Thursday.
   Sentenced with ringleader Adi Tal was his chief lieutenant, Nir
Goldeshtein, who received 40 months from U.S. District Judge John
Bissell. Each man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and
two counts of specific currency violations.
   The 2{-year investigation led to the indictment of 16 people last
March in Seattle, Los Angeles, New Jersey, Colombia and Israel.
   The government alleged $25 million was laundered during an
18-month period ending in March. The money in this case was shipped
to Panama or Colombia or smuggled to Europe and Israel and wired to
Panamanian bank accounts, officials said.
   In a memorandum released after Tal's sentencing, the government
provided more details about the money's origin.
   The government said Tal, a former airline worker who emigrated
from Israel in 1983, worked with Jose Stroh, allegedly a primary
money-launderer for the Cali, a Colombian cocaine cartel that is one
of the world's major exporters of the drug.
   According to the memorandum, Tal dealt repeatedly with Stroh over
the telephone and directed money to be transferred to bank accounts
controlled by Stroh.
   Tal's attorney, Philip R. Sellinger, said his client was
recruited by a lifelong friend in Israel _ Enrique Korc, a fugitive
in the case and Stroh's nephew. He said Korc never told Tal the
source of the money. The government has said it was tied to drugs.
   Tal and Goldeshtein were the last to be sentenced in the case.
Both men, 28, had recently moved from the Seattle area to Edison
before their arrest.
   Of the others indicted, nine have been sentenced. The wives of
Goldeshtein and Tal entered a pre-trial diversion program and the
rest are fugitives. One defendant, Rabbi Sholom Levitin, is the
founder and head of Chabad House, a community center for the
Lubavitch Hasidic sect.
   Levitin was sentenced to 30 days in a halfway house. Tal and
Goldeshtein ``occasionally invested thousands of dollars at a time''
with Levitin in addition to his duties in the network, officials
said. Levitin denied knowing the money he admitted laundering was
ill-gotten.
   According to government papers, Tal told his mostly Israeli
operatives that the money was unrelated to crime, Rabner said. Tal
explained that the cash came from Israel for investment in the
United States or that it was somehow connected to the Mossad,
Israel's secret service.

<HEAD>Farmers Paid in Drought Insurance Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than $18 million was mailed Thursday to
6,860 farmers in 10 states who settled a legal dispute with Chubb
Corp. over crop insurance applications rejected during the 1988
drought.
   Lawrence Kane Jr., a Cincinnati lawyer who was appointed by U.S.
District Judge Carl Rubin last fall to oversee the payments, said
the farmers should be mailed the remaining 50 percent of their
settlement payments by late April.
   Kane said he and his staff are still trying to resolve objections
by about 930 farmers who oppose the $36.6 million settlement with
Chubb Corp., based in Warren, N.J., and its insurance subsidiaries.
Also still pending are processing problems with the cases of some
other farmers, which remain to be worked out.
   The class-action case involves 7,484 farmers in Illinois, Iowa,
Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri
and Wisconsin. The first payments cover 6,860 of the claims.
   The farmers sued after Chubb began rejecting premiums and
applications for insurance against crop damage as the drought
worsened last year. Chubb lawyers said the company was prepared to
sell only about $40 million in coverage, but that its brokers sold
more than $200 million.
   Chubb and its insurance subsidiaries agreed in November to a
settlement in which the company set aside a fund of $48.1 million to
settle the farmers' claims. Kane said that not all of the fund may
have to be used to pay the claims.
   Chubb Corp. and the farmers since have teamed to sue Good Weather
International Corp., the agent that Chubb alleges violated its
contract with the company by selling more than the available number
of crop insurance policies. Rubin is to hear that lawsuit May 1.
   Good Weather has refused to comment on the case while it is under
litigation.

   Randall Dale Adams, newly freed from the
charges that nearly led to his execution, arrived home Thursday to
tears and hugs from family members and friends who had waited more
than a decade for his release.
   ``You're supposed to have a resurrection around Easter,'' Adams'
mother, Mildred, said shortly after embracing her son as he stepped
off the plane at Port Columbus International Airport. ``I guess this
is it.''
   Adams arrived in his hometown just as the Dallas County, Texas,
district attorney announced Adams would not be retried for the 1976
slaying of a Dallas policeman.
   Told of the news as he arrived, Adams remained skeptical.
   ``I'll wait until I hear it from my attorney. I'm not supposed to
talk about the case,'' Adams told reporters.
   Later, he said, ``I've been standing in a twilight zone for the
past 12{ years. ... I was in that twilight zone until the door
opened. Thank God it did.''
   Adams was convicted and sentenced to die in 1977 for the murder
of Dallas police officer Robert Wood, a crime to which another man
has virtually confessed. Adams was three days away from exection
before his sentence was commuted in 1980 to life in prison.
   The case came under scrutiny in the documentary ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' which questioned the testimony of the state's key witness,
David Harris. Earlier this week, Adams was released from prison in
Texas on grounds his first trial was unfair.
   As he arrived in Columbus, Adams embraced his mother first, and
both broke into tears. Errol Morris, director of ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' had to battle a contingent of reporters and photographers to
get close to Adams. He and Adams then embraced.
   About 100 supporters, many of them wearing yellow lapel ribbons,
looked on. Among them was Tressa Lucas, a family friend.
   ``It feels great,'' Ms. Lucas said. ``It's the best I've felt in
40 years, almost. His mother and I are real good friends, and we
just stuck by each other. She's just really had a hard time.
   ``I told her all along that the Lord would have him released.''
   Mayor Dana Rinehart joined the merrymakers, offering a job to
Adams, who was unemployed before his arrest in Dallas. Rinehart said
he had no specific job in mind but would work that out with Adams.
   Adams told Rinehart jokingly, ``I didn't really want to be
mayor.''
   Asked if he expected such a reception, Adams said, ``I couldn't
have dreamed this. I knew I would be home, but not this way.''
   Adams, who appeared red-faced and said he did not feel well after
he got off the plane, was given an Ohio State University cap and a
lei made of daffodils.
   A few moments later, he held a news conference at the airport. As
he walked from the terminal gate toward the area where the news
conference was to be held, Adams' mother and his sister, Nancy,
stood on either side of him and appeared to be holding him up. He
was taken to a private room in the airport and appeared fully
recovered when he began speaking to reporters.
   While Adams was being reunited with his family here, District
Attorney John Vance announced in Dallas that a motion had been filed
with state District Judge Larry Baraka to dismiss the capital murder
charge against Adams.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in March set aside the
conviction, saying Adams hadn't gotten a fair trial because
prosecutors suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on the stand.

<HEAD>Mexico: U.S. Immigration Officials Can't Be Based in Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Relations Department announced
Wednesday it has no agreement with the United States allowing U.S.
immigration officials to be based in Mexico.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service recently posted
teams of agents in Mexico to monitor the routes of Central Americans
passing through the country on their way to the United States,
mostly to southern Texas.
   The operation, which began Feb. 21 and has been canceled, came
under criticism in Mexico. Mexican newspapers called it ``outrageous
intrusion on Mexican sovereignty.''
   The INS was quoted as saying its patrols were carried out with
the cooperation of the Mexican government.
   The Foreign Relations Department, in a dispatch sent to news
agencies Wednesday afternoon, said, ``There is no diplomatic accord
between Mexico and the United States that establishes the
collaboration of the Mexican police and the INS to avoid the flow of
undocumented immigrants to the United States.''
   The INS agents, traveling through Mexico, filed their daily
reports to Washington from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, news
reports said.
   The INS has denied that the operation was undercover, but
canceled it anyway.
   Central Americans have been emigrating to the United States in
ever-increasing numbers, U.S. officials say. Some officials estimate
that 100,000 Central Americans will try to enter the United States
this year.
   On Feb. 21, the U.S. government clamped down on the flow of
aliens asking for asylum in the United States by demanding proof of
persecution. Since then, the overwhelming number of asylum cases in
south Texas have been denied and the number of people seeking
amnesty has dropped.

<HEAD>Van Bombing Reenacted for Television Showing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-crime group blew up a van Wednesday to
dramatize the bombing of a vehicle driven by the wife of a Navy
captain, and authorities said the reenactment will be shown on local
television to draw out witnesses.
   The videotaped bombing is part of the investigation into a March
10 blast that destroyed a van driven by Sharon Rogers, wife of USS
Vincennes Capt. Will C. Rogers III.
   A van similar to the one driven by Mrs. Rogers was taken to a
deserted area near an airstrip and rigged for explosion and fire by
Fire Department bomb experts.
   The reenactment is intended ``to trigger something in the mind of
someone who may have seen something that day or in Mrs. Rogers'
neighborhood leading up to the time of the bombing,'' said Molly
Wilson Cartmill, executive director of the San Diego chapter of
Crime Stoppers.
   The national, non-profit organization, which staged the
reenactment in cooperation with local and federal authorities,
operates an anonymous tip hot line and raises reward money for those
who help authorities solve crimes.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Rogers was interviewed on videotape at San Diego
police headquarters for the Crime Stoppers segment on the attack.
The tape will be distributed to local television stations Monday.
   ``My understanding is she was an excellent speaker,'' said
Cartmill. ``She did really well. She talks a lot about that morning,
the explosion itself, and she makes a plea for information'' from
the public.
   Mrs. Rogers escaped injury in the explosion, which occured when
she was stopped at an intersection near the La Jolla area of San
Diego.
   Authorities are investigating if the attack was terrorist
retaliation for the Vincennes' mistaken destruction of an Iranian
jetliner in the Persian Gulf last July. All 290 aboard were killed.
   A total of $27,000 is being offered for information in the case:
$25,000 from an anonymous San Diego developer, $1,000 from Crime
Stoppers and $1,000 from the Vincennes crew.
   The videotape is being created with the cooperation of the FBI,
the lead agency in the investigation, as well as Naval Investigative
Services and local authorities, Cartmill said.
   On Tuesday, the Rogerses made their first public statement since
the bombing, sending out a letter that calls on the nation to resist
bowing to terrorism.
   ``The image of a burning van in the middle of a street of our
community must not become a symbol of fear and unreasoned
reaction,'' they said.
   Mrs. Rogers reportedly is resentful over the loss of her teaching
job at La Jolla Country Day school following the bombing.
   Although the school has maintained that her leaving was a mutual
decision, sources told the Los Angeles Times that Mrs. Rogers was
fired after the possibility of terrorism was raised.
   Jim Stewart, the school's development director, said officials
are standing by their earlier statement that Mrs. Rogers' and school
officials decided she should leave her fourth-grade teaching
position ``to ensure the safety of the children.''
   Stewart also said the school will pay Mrs. Rogers her full salary
through August. He declined to say how much that is.

Palestinian uprising will not let up until Israel withdraws from the
territories.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau and Yasser Abed-Rabbo of the

few minutes over a cup of coffee, then faced each other over green
baize-covered tables.
   On that note Wednesday began the first formal meeting under the
administration of President Bush between Israel's biggest supporter

   Pelletreau said U.S. concerns about terrorism were discussed as
well as ``practical steps that can be taken in the occupied
territories to reduce tensions.''

   House Republicans gave new status to their most
ardent Democrat-basher by electing Newt Gingrich as their No. 2
leader, but they also put him on the firing line with the Democrats
loaded up.
   ``I think it is manna from heaven,'' said House Majority Whip
Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who said Democrats would remind voters of the
many controversial stands _ such as support for Social Security cuts
_ that the right-wing Georgia lawmaker has taken over the years.
   ``We're no longer talking about someone who is just another
member of the Republican Party,'' Coelho said.
   Gingrich emerged from a closed meeting of House Republicans on
Wednesday with an 87-85 victory over Edward Madigan of Illinois in
the race to become House minority whip, the post made vacant when
Dick Cheney became secretary of defense.

   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling that declared the
city's government unconstitutional prompted an immediate threat of
secession from Staten Island, to which Mayor Edward I. Koch replied,
``I'll protect it.''
   The Board of Estimate, a body unique to New York City, is ``a
substantial departure from the one-person, one-vote ideal,'' Justice
Byron R. White wrote in the unanimous ruling Wednesday.
   The justices upheld a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling requiring a
plan that meets that standard. Currently, the borough of Staten
Island, with fewer than 400,000 residents, has the same voting power
on the board as Brooklyn, with 2.2 million.
   The board governs everything from land-use decisions to setting
sewer and water rates, negotiating city contracts and awarding
franchises and leasing property. It also has partial authority for
the city's $25 billion budget.

   Leaders of a Colombian drug cartel
bribed Nicaraguan officials for use of a military base as a way
station for 3,000 pounds of cocaine before smuggling it into this
country, according to a federal indictment.
   Leaders of the Medellin cartel masterminded the slayings of the
Colombian justice minister and a U.S. drug informant, according to
the federal District Court indictment unsealed Wednesday.
   The indictment accuses 30 people, including an associate of the
Bahamian prime minister, of participating in a ring that imported 22
tons of cocaine _ $1 billion worth _ into the United States.
   ``This is an encompassing indictment that talks about the whole
system of importing cocaine from Colombia through the Bahamas to the
United States beginning in about 1974 and continuing into 1989,''
said Jack Hook, a DEA spokesman.

transformed the league into a national institution and presided over
the Super Bowl's birth.
   A likely successor was described as a man in his 40s or early 50s

<HEAD>Oscar Ballot Comes Under Scrutiny As Some Allege Team Voting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film
studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences.
   And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements _ from free coffee
mugs to complimentary buffet dinners _ Academy members are
acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee, in
violation of the rules. Secretaries, spouses and friends, several
Academy members say, are marking ballots in what is supposed to be
the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition.
   ``It's like a local election of judges,'' said Academy member
Harry Clein, who said he's witnessed team voting. ``A lot of people
don't know who the candidates are. So they take a look at who's
around them and see what the consensus is.
   ``As far as elections go, it's not bad. But I've never been
through an election in Argentina.''
   Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting
firm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee that
Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots.
   ``All we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been
returned,'' he said. ``Members are on the honor system to fill out
the ballot themselves.''
   More than 4,600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st
Annual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Academy members vote on their area
of specialty. The Academy's actors branch, for example, is the only
group to select nominees in the four acting categories.
   Since the voting is done secretly _ members do not sign their
ballots _ the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric
control number, Lyle said. Ballots are invalidated only if there is
more than one vote in a given category, and only the votes in that
specific category are not tallied, he said.
   Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and all
specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees
composed of Academy members.
   All voting members of the Academy can participate in the best
picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all
categories. Winners for best documentary feature, best animated
short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those
members who have seen all the nominees.
   Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most of his
colleagues take the voting very seriously. ``I don't even vote (in a
category) if I'm not familiar with the pictures in that category.
... And I've never told someone to vote for a film, even when I've
done some of them.''
   Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken,
speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman. ``Although you're
asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot of
people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote
for their own picture and leave the other four blank,'' he said.
   Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar
victory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising that
a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.
   ``The Last Emperor'' took in $18.9 million, close to half the
film's gross, after it won last year's best picture trophy. More
than 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986's best picture,
``Platoon,'' came after the film was nominated. On average, a best
picture award is worth about $20 million these days.
   A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio,
therefore, can be a good investment. In the case of this year's
awards, a flurry of Academy-oriented newspaper advertisements,
banquets, complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late
releases appears to have been remarkably successful.
   This year, all best picture nominees and the large majority of
top acting nominees came from movies released in December: ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Rain Man'' and
``Working Girl'' were all released after Dec. 16.
   While these five movies might be good, the nearly complete
exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the
studios' mastery of Oscar marketing.
   ``I think the Academy Awards are crap,'' said Terry Gilliam,
director of ``Brazil'' and the current ``The Adventures of Baron
Munchausen.''
   ``It's about selling films is all it's about,'' he said. ``It's
one more way of flogging some films. When `Brazil' got nominated (in
1986), they asked me to be a member of the Academy. And I wouldn't
join. I just don't want to be a part of that at all.''
   And at least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner,
says that the manipulation of Oscar voters has reached new depths.
Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes for
Sigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for ``Gorillas in the
Mist,'' could lead him to vote against the film.
   ``I have in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaver
and a beautiful gorilla than I need,'' Reiner said of promotional
material sent to his home. ``We've got to tell the Academy to stop
this advertising. I'm getting turned off on the pictures I like.''

<HEAD>Retirement's Peace Shattered As Children Move Back In To Die</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUDSON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retirement's tranquility, seen by many as a
reward after the responsibilities of child-rearing, is coming to a
jarring end for a growing number whose children want to move back in
_ and have AIDS.
   ``Some parents find out for the first time their child is gay and
at the same time he also has AIDS. This is a real blow,'' said one
56-year-old woman whose son was diagnosed two years ago with AIDS.
She asked that her name not be used because her son doesn't want his
identity known. ``Parents always think they should die first, before
their children.''
   ``And AIDS can split families,'' she added. ``Some members of the
family accept, others reject him. That makes it worse for everybody.
And you lose friends. Some churches even reject you.''
   In addition, said Roger Lane of the Health Crisis Network in
Miami, the $50,000 to $120,000 costs of care for AIDS patients ``put
an extra burden on the parents, particularly if they are elderly and
have limited finances.''
   Increasingly, social workers and AIDS help network officials say,
AIDS victims are coming to Florida. Some come from the North because
warm weather helps protect them from the pneumonia and flu they are
susceptible to, others come from small states for better health care
_ and others have parents here.
   ``My parents have been great,'' said a 41-year-old AIDS patient
who moved from Colorado to Palm Beach County five months ago. ``The
clinic (in Palm Beach County) is really pretty good. Certainly, the
weather is great.''
   State officials have no firm data on AIDS migrants, but some
clinics estimate that 10 percent to 15 percent of AIDS patients came
to Florida after being diagnosed. The number of reported cases,
which officials said would not include some victims diagnosed
elsewhere, has tripled since January 1987 to 6,856, putting Florida
third behind New York and California.
   ``We don't turn patients away,'' said Jim Cobb, administrator of
the state AIDS clinic in Palm Beach County. ``But we can't be the
front doorstep for the country. We don't want to resemble the Statue
of Liberty.''
   As education about acquired immune deficiency syndrome has
improved, and when relatives accept that the deadly virus isn't
contracted by casual contact, instances of family rejection are
decreasing, Lane said. ``Think about being at the terminal stage of
your life and you have been rejected by the ones you feel close to,
and you feel isolated from your relatives.''
   ``The scariest thing for a young person is to be alone,'' said
Mary Meeker, who through Catholic Church volunteer activities now
works with the Pasco AIDS Support Community and cares for two AIDS
victims as a volunteer.
   ``I found that gays are the first ones to turn and run when they
find out you have AIDS,'' said a 26-year-old Hudson man who was
diagnosed in October and asked not to be identified to protect his
lover. ``But my family has been very supportive. I'm glad they're
there.''
   In small towns like Hudson, 30 miles north of Tampa on the Gulf
Coast, news that someone is infected with AIDS spreads quickly and
reaction can be quick.
   The Hernando-Pasco Hospice, dedicated to helping terminal
patients die with loving care at home, in October 1987 started a
Pasco support group.
   Participants have painful memories: a son whose parents changed
the locks; a youth whose brother-in-law told him to hurry up and die
so he wouldn't burden the family; a woman whose boss made her get
tested after he learned her son had AIDS, then transferred her from
a cafeteria job despite a negative test result.
   The group has grown from four to at least 36 members and spawned
two other groups in Pasco County, where 44 percent of the 260,000
residents are over 55.
   ``We have so many elderly people here, so many parents in one
place, that we're seeing AIDS patients from other cities coming here
to die with their parents,'' said Peter Pavich, a support group
member who has been diagnosed with human immune deficiency virus,
HIV, which causes AIDS.
   Pavich said the group has helped him understand rejection by his
family. ``It's really unfair. It's supposed to be their golden
years, and everything's going great and then they're hit with this
brick wall and everything changes.''
   The hospice helped the 26-year-old Hudson man, who feared he
would die in a hospital in October as pneumonia worsened, his weight
dropped to 95 pounds, and doctors refused to release him unless he
could supply his oxygen, medicine and other needs. He's now up to
145 pounds and talks with determined optimism.
   ``I try not to think about it. I know eventually it's going to
happen, but I live day to day and try to make every day the best
possible,'' he said.
   In this county, which is typical of rural counties being
discovered by developers, a relatively small influx of AIDS victims
quickly strains services.
   ``There are so many things we need in this area. We need food,
medical attention, outpatient care, dental treatment,'' said Eva
Sylvester, a hospice services coordinator who recently called seven
dentists before finding one who would care for an AIDS patient. ``We
get frustrated; we get angry. What we need is more information and
more education.''

<HEAD>Portugal Wooing Former Colonies in Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portugal is trying to win the friendship
of the former African colonies where it fought bitter wars just 15
years ago.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's recent visit to
Guinea-Bissau, Portugal's former West African colony where the fight
for independence was the fiercest, was the latest in a series of
journeys that included the Atlantic island nations of Cape Verde and
Sao Tome e Principe and is likely to continue with Mozambique in
southeast Africa later this year.
   A package of nine accords signed in Bissau, including an
agreement to create the framework of an escudo zone, is seen as an
effort to regain influence in Africa and improve Portugal's
diplomatic standing worldwide. The escudo is Portugal's currency.
   A string of left-leaning governments that followed the Portuguese
military coup April 25, 1974, never seemed able to get close to the
then-Marxist revolutionary governments in the five African countries
where Portuguese is still the official language.
   The five nations _ known by the Portuguese acronym PALOPS, for
Portuguese-Speaking African Countries _ are Angola, Cape Verde,
Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Sao Tome e Principe. They embarked on
a Marxist-inspired path of development via industrialization and
centralized economies after gaining independence in the mid-1970s.
   According to Adelino Torres, lecturer on Africa at Lisbon's
Higher Institute for Economics, ``it was always a question of
values'' with Portugal's socialist governments.
   ``If (African) governments weren't democratic enough, there was
no deal. It was an obstacle to cooperation.''
   Torres said Cavaco Silva, a center-right Social Democrat Cavaco
Silva, ``puts business first.''
   ``The reinforcement of our relations with the PALOPS is a
priority of this government,'' says Jose Durao Barroso, secretary of
state for foreign affairs and cooperation, who is regarded as the
driving force behind Portugal's African policy.
   Since the Social Democrats under Cavaco Silva won Portugal's
first absolute parliamentary majority in July 1987, Portugal has
signed 78 cooperation accords with its former African colonies.
   In the beginning these involved agreements on sports, education,
farming and health, but recent agreements include military accords
with all PALOPS countries except Angola, which remains locked in
civil war.
   Nevertheless, Portugal will become the first Western nation to
have a military attache in Luanda, Angola's capital, following a
recent exchange agreement.
   The decision to guarantee the convertibility of Guinea-Bissau's
peso currency by linking it to Portugal's escudo, was a ``major,
qualitative step in cooperation,'' Durao Barroso said.
   Sao Tome and Cape Verde are likely to be interested in a similar
accord. Mozambique's membership in an escudo zone is expected to be
discussed before the end of the year.
   Up to now, Portugal's drive for closer links with the Africans
has concentrated mostly on the three smallest countries.
   Because Cape Verde, Sao Tome e Principe and Guinea-Bissau lack
the size and potential wealth of Angola and Mozambique, they have
retained close trading links with Portugal.
   The view in Lisbon is that increased influence in Mozambique and
Angola would lend Portugal greater political weight in the
international arena.
   Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro has been drumming up
international support for a projected $600 million-economic
assistance plan for Angola, once fighting ends between the Marxist
government in Luanda and U.S.-backed rebels of UNITA, the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Portugal has pledged $50 million toward the rehabilitation of the
strategic east-west Benguela railway that before independence
provided a vital route for exports from nearby Zaire and Zambia to
the Atlantic.
   But competition for influence in Angola, potentially one of
sub-Saharan Africa's richest nations, is growing.
   Brazil, itself a former Portuguese territory, has already granted
Luanda a $1.2 billion-credit to be repaid in Angolan oil.
   Italy, France, Spain and other European Economic Community
nations are looking to increase trade with Angola, a country
Portugal regarded as the jewel in its colonial crown.
   As the poorest member of the 12-nation EEC, Portugal cannot
compete on economic terms with its European neighbors. But Durao
Barroso says the Portuguese should cash in on a competitive
advantage of experience and adaptability.
   ``The Portuguese have a good understanding of Africa and Africans
... and we cost less,'' he said. ``It's usually cheaper to employ a
Portuguese teacher, say, than one from a richer country.''

<HEAD>Wholey Talking Again on PBS; Talented Cast in `Men'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid the rock 'em, sock 'em yocks of Saturday
night, viewers will soon have a saner alternative when a kinder kind
of talk-show host, Dennis Wholey, returns to PBS with ``LateNight
America.''
   ``I guess you could say we're going to be the Saturday
alternative to wrestling and the Church Lady,'' Wholey said,
referring to the popular character on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live.''
   Wholey's two-hour weekly talk show will feature in-studio guests
_ newsmakers, authors and celebrities _ responding to telephone
queries and comments. It premieres Saturday on about 100 public
television stations nationwide.
   Wholey, a former Detroit radio talk-show host, was host of the
critically praised ``LateNight America'' on PBS from 1982 until he
ended the run in 1985.
   ``I made a decision to leave, because I wanted to take a look at
my own background,'' he said in a telephone interview from
Washington, where the show will originate. ``I grew up in an
alcoholic home, and as a recovering alcoholic myself, I just wanted
to get out of the public eye.''
   Wholey went through private therapy, started some Adult Children
of Alcoholics groups and wrote books: ``The Courage of Change:
Personal Conversations About Alcoholism,'' ``Are You Happy?'' and
the most recent ``Becoming Your Own Parent: The Solution for Adult
Children of Alcoholics.''
   After all that, he said, ``I felt very good, and all of a sudden
it came time to go back on the air again.''
   Part of the talk show will revolve around self-help issues, but
mostly it will be a discussion of an eclectic collection of subjects
_ for instance, upcoming topics include gun control and the Academy
Awards.
   Viewers who flee the confrontational styles of many current talk
shows can relax with Wholey.
   ``I think that people trust me,'' he said. ``I don't think that
television is church. I make mistakes. I probably mispronounce
words. I'm up there, I'm one of them, and I think the audience
perceives that I'm part of who they are.''

   In ABC's new ``Men,'' four high-school buddies, a surgeon, a
lawyer, a newspaper columnist and a cop, now in their 30s, still
meet weekly over poker to crack wise. Just like a million guys in
America.
   Despite the unlikely premise, ``Men,'' set in Baltimore and
filmed in Toronto, comes darn close to succeeding, thanks mainly to
the fine cast: Ted Wass (``Soap''), Saul Rubinek, Ving Rhames and
Tom O'Brien.
   It premieres Saturday.
   The look of the show, directed by Peter Werner, will contribute
to the already unavoidable comparison to ``thirtysomething.''
``Men'' isn't ``thirtysomething,'' even though it is about 30-ish
folks who spend a lot of time trying to figure out why they're not
happy. It's not nearly as well-written.
   Rubinek, the only Canadian among the regulars, plays Paul, a
columnist for the Baltimore Sun who rhapsodizes about his ex-wife,
before finding out she plans not to get back with him but to marry
an investment banker who saves Paul's ego by turning out to be bald.
   Wass is surgeon Steven, who spends most of his time picking up
new women, then finding something wrong with them and dumping them
before things get serious. Rhames is lawyer Charlie, the black
member of group and its resident, well-adjusted family man.
   O'Brien is Danny, a quick-tempered young cop, whose older brother
Tom, also a cop, was a founding member of the group.
   In the pilot, Tom is killed chasing down a purse-snatcher in an
incongruously violent sequence. His death prompts soul-searching
among the others. Too often the pilot wanders into sentimentality
when it isn't being awfully convenient.
   Steven is the surgeon who operates on Tom. What are there, four
people in all of Baltimore? Paul works at a newspaper, but doesn't
seem to write anything. Would Jimmy Breslin not write about the
death of a cop who was one of his best friends?
   After Tom's funeral, Paul goes off to the old high-school
football field. Steven shows up there, too, just by chance. The two
run across the field reliving that touchdown run that won the big
game.
   Steven chides that the game-winner occurred ``only once.'' ``Once
was immortal,'' declares Paul. ``Once gives me bragging rights
forever.''
   So it's been lifted from innumerable buddy movies. It's still a
nice scene.
   By the end of the episode, Danny has won his place in the group
and we're back at the poker table.
   ``Men'' is worth dealing in, at least for a few hands.

<HEAD>PBS Series Looks At U.S. Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of a five-part public TV series on U.S.
education is called ``The Education Race'' _ an unfortunate title
for an otherwise superb, eye-opening program.
   Learning these days is too often spoken of as a race rather than
a lifelong habit. Current fashion has it that American children are
in some sort of global education contest from birth. And they are
``losing'' this race to the Japanese, the Koreans and just about
everyone else.
   This perception seems more curmudgeonly than constructive. If
we're losing economic ground to the Japanese, it's a bit heartless
to put that failure on the shoulders of kindergartners.
   Fortunately, despite its title, the first hour of the PBS series,
``Learning in America,'' sidesteps that trap. The series, premiering
tonight and airing weekly, is the product of more than 1,000
interviews in 21 states, Europe, and Japan _ and all that reporting
shows.
   The first part, narrated by Roger Mudd, is extraordinary
television for its depth and sophistication.
   The PBS correspondents behind the series, Paul Solman, John
Merrow and Charlayne Hunter-Gault, include the right balance of
experts to paint an incisive and sobering view of American
classrooms.
   David Kearns, chairman of Xerox Corp., says schools need complete
restructuring if they are to produce tomorrow's workers. Jonathan
Kozol, an authority on illiteracy, says the biggest corporate
``gift'' a company could give a school would be for executives to
send their children to the local public school, not private
academies.
   A generation ago, Mudd says, America asked, can Johnny read? Now
it's, ``Can Johnny think? Can Johnny compute?''
   He takes us to classrooms in a high school in Fremont, Calif.,
and one in Yokohama, Japan. In Japan, students go through ``exam
hell'' to see who goes on to college and career success. They spend
240 days a year in school. Americans spend 180.
   But, we learn Japanese youngsters rarely feel neglected or
alienated. There is no time and little inclination for sex or drugs.
Their parents sacrifice. They expect hard work from their children,
but they don't saddle them with household chores or afterschool jobs.
   In such a small country, parents can't leave a legacy of land to
their children. Learning is the birthright. And they do indeed learn.
   It couldn't be more different in America. Teens are said to
display a ``cool indifference'' to hard work.
   Parents see themselves as busy surviving, so schools wind up with
much of the parenting role.
   Non-college-bound Japanese youngsters go to vocational schools,
like many Americans. But in Japan they learn on sophisticated,
high-tech equipment and have a full load of academic courses. Nearly
all get jobs eventually.
   In America, vocational students learn to repair cars. Instead of
academics, they get Mickey-Mouse courses in cooking or how to
balance checkbooks. Many wind up in junior college where they learn
what they should have mastered in high school.
   This failure to educate amounts to a ``hidden tax'' on U.S.
industry, which winds up spending thousands of dollars educating
workers in basic skills.
   In a particularly informative sequence, U.S. youngsters display
their dismaying ignorance of the skills needed to succeed in the job
market. Students think they can always get a ``factory job'' no
matter how little they know. The reality is that even entry-level
jobs now require computer and thinking skills.
   The program reveals that some 350 U.S. companies have set up
operations in Ireland where an eager and educated workforce is more
than happy to settle into jobs that U.S. youngsters are thumbing
their noses at.
   New York Life Insurance Co. sends health claim forms to Ireland
to be processed by workers who are not afraid of work, and who have
the math skills that many U.S. high school graduates lack.
   Finally, the program takes a look at South Carolina, perhaps the
closest thing America has to an educational miracle. The state
passed a sweeping education reform package in 1984 that has helped
raise test scores and lure whites back to public schools.
   The program correctly indicates that South Carolina is a national
model for bringing business into partnership with schools. It omits,
however, the more questionable features of that state's reform
efforts, particularly the incredible volume of state-mandated tests
heaped on students.
   Such nits aside, this first hour of ``Learning in America''
augurs well for the remaining four: ``Upstairs-Downstairs,'' private
vs. public schools; ``Teach Your Children,'' concern about
curricula; ``Wanted: A Million Teachers,'' getting and keeping good
teachers; ``Paying the Freight,'' the future _ and cost _ of
education in America.

<HEAD>No Tax Increase? Why It's Unnatural</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No tax increase? Why that's like saying the sun
won't set or the tide won't rise or that your pay stub next year
won't read any differently than it does right now.
   It's against nature, in this instance human or political, no
matter what the promise was by President Bush. The president may not
be reneging, but there will indeed be a tax increase this year,
amounting to nearly $147 billion.
   Anyone checking out a pay stub already is aware of some of that
increase, because an additional $36.1 billion income tax bill and
billions more in Social Security tax increases went into effect
automatically with the new year.
   The riddle has a simple if painful explanation: Since the big tax
cut in 1981, Congress has enacted 13 separate tax bills. The
additions to the tax load began in the very next year and continued
right through 1988.
   Provisions in those bills kick in automatically. That is, says
the Tax Foundation, which supplied these numbers, taxes grow without
any new tax action, the reason being that ``increases are already
here.''
   The situation has many lessons, among them:
   _When it comes to taxes, Congress can dictate policy for a
president who, at the time, hadn't even announced his candidacy.
   _Congress giveth and Congress taketh away. It giveth
dramatically, it taketh quickly and, when possible, quietly.
   For example, the biggest tax increase of the 1980s, the Tax
Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, was passed in 1982, one year
after the biggest tax cut of the 1980s, the Economic Recovery Tax
Act in 1981.
   _United States tax policy is inconsistent, changing every year.
   But the biggest, most important and most painful lesson is that
there seems to be no way of avoiding tax increases, even when the
most powerful political figure in the nation gives his promise.
   The Washington-based research foundation, whose non-profit and
non-partisan designation confers certain tax-exemptions, calculates
that TEFRA _ the 1982 tax increase _ will by itself raise taxes
$55.7 billion this year.
   Moving right along, the 1984 Deficit Reduction Act (DEFRA) likely
will raise another $27.7 billion more this year than last, $16
billion of it through individual income taxes and the rest from
corporations.
   The Revenue Act of 1987, enacted in an effort to avoid any
election-year tax manipulation, managed to do something of that very
sort. Last year it yielded $8.6 billion; this year, it will cost
taxpayers about $14 billion.
   Unlike income tax increases, which are broadly based, some
increases scheduled for this year affect only certain groups. The
Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, passed last July 1, will impact
senior citizens mainly, especially those in higher-income brackets.
   Says the foundation: ``The estimated (MCCA) revenue increase for
1989 is only $600 million; but after 1989 the revenue take will
average around $7 billion a year, just from the elderly.''
   In other words, while the impact of that measure will be felt
mildly this year it will provoke cries of pain thereafter.
   It is the kind of reaction that might make Congress consider
still another version of tax policy.

   A few feet from the spot where a
young Bob Dylan once performed for an indifferent audience, Lena
Spencer makes her bed.
   In the same room where Don McLean played while his ``American
Pie'' was climbing the charts, Lena's 14-year-old white Persian cat,
Sasha, pads across the wooden floor worn smooth by the tapping feet
of a generation of folk music fans.
   This is Caffe Lena, regarded as the nation's oldest continually
run coffeehouse. It is the place where Lena Spencer has made her
livelihood for 29 years and her home for the past two.
   Here, one floor above a French bistro, a vacant violin shop and
Hattie's Chicken Shack, 20 small tables and 80 chairs fill an
L-shaped, brick-walled room. A small stage, microphone stand and an
upright piano take up most of one corner.
   Lena has been forced out of her last three apartments by new
landlords intent on renovations and higher rents. ``I finally said,
`What the heck,' and set up a room in the back.''
   Failing eyesight and heart ailments have slowed her over the
years, and her friends fret over the fact that she lives alone with
only Sasha for company. But Lena, who turned 66 on Jan. 4, feels an
attachment to the Caffe that most people reserve for old friends.
   ``The Caffe is my whole existence, the be-all and end-all of my
life,'' she said. ``My life began almost in 1960.''
   Caffe Lena has seen such folk stars as Dylan, McLean, Pete
Seeger, David Bromberg, Loudon Wainwright III, Arlo Guthrie and
Ramblin' Jack Elliot, sidekick of the late Woody Guthrie, Arlo's
father.
   Veterans of the folk circuit, such as U. Utah Phillips, Tom
Paxton and Dave Van Ronk, return year after year, drawn by Caffe
Lena's informal setting, appreciative audiences and Lena's own
indomitable spirit. Others, such as Tom Rush, Rick Danko, Tom Chapin
and John Phillips play Lena's to boost solo careers.
   And then there are the young musicians, the ones who saw the folk
venues dwindling but found an audience at Lena's: The Roches, Aztec
Twostep, Rory Block, Christine Lavin, Tony Bird. Mississippi
bluesmen, gospel singers, jazz players, actors, playwrights and
poets have all found an outlet at Caffe Lena, where they don't have
to compete with televisions or video games. And Lena has never had a
liquor license. Coffee, tea and baked goods are served, along with
the music, for a cover charge of $5 to $15.
   Running Caffe Lena has not been easy. Lena, as she likes to be
called, still takes reservations over the phone herself, books all
acts, does her own publicity work and deals with bills and creditors.
   Though a tight group of friends and supporters distributes her
posters around town, serves as waitresses and cooks on performance
nights and works the lights and the sound system, the tough times
get more difficult as the years progress.
   ``I get through those periods,'' Lena said. ``I just grit my
teeth and say, `Damn it, I'm going to continue.''' And she puts
everything she has into the coffeehouse.
   Keeping Caffe Lena open has meant many sacrifices, including her
marriage. Her husband, Bill, left her in the early '60s when he
wanted to move on and she didn't. She doesn't own a car and depends
on taxis and friends for transportation. Money is tight. A $32
residual check for a bit part in the movie ``Ironweed'' seems like a
windfall.
   Part of the blame for her situation lies with Lena. Since its
first day, her coffeehouse has primarily served as a place where
young musicians come to develop their skills.
   ``She insists that young people have a forum, a stage on which to
build an audience,'' says Al McKenney, a folk music festival
coordinator. ``It's a brave _ some say foolish _ policy, but a good
one.''
   Many of the regular performers at Lena's are musicians who have
been coming back for 10 or 20 years or more. They eventually become
part of her family. Folksinger Scott Alarik remembers Lena's
apartments always being filled with ``stray cats and folksingers.''
   ``And she always insists on paying people as much as she can,
which for Lena means more than she should,'' he said.
   Caffe Lena was once the favorite haunt of students at Skidmore
College, a liberal arts school formerly located up the street from
the coffeehouse. The college's relocation to the outskirts of town
in the early '70s was followed by a decline in folk's popularity,
and Caffe Lena suffered.
   ``The really good years were the '60s and early '70s,'' Lena
said. ``People would come to the Caffe no matter who was performing.
They could trust my judgment.''
   But the students, perhaps inspired by the music of such new folk
artists as Tracy Chapman, are returning. The Caffe is attracting
more and more students who are too young to get into Saratoga's
bars. And Lena's still holds a special place on the folk circuit.
   ``People still want to play Lena's,'' said Alarik, a Boston
musician who first performed at the coffeehouse a decade ago. ``It's
still as good as it gets for folk music. For getting right up close
and friendly, I don't think it gets any better than Lena's.''
   Van Ronk has been playing Lena's since the beginning. ``At that
point I don't think anyone envisioned themselves going on for 29
years,'' he said.
   It was a call from Van Ronk's wife, Terri Thal, to Lena that got
Dylan a gig in Saratoga, one of the few coffeehouses he in which he
performed before going on to concerts. But when Dylan took the stage
at Caffe Lena, the audience was more interested in their own
conversations than the music.
   ``Nobody would listen to him,'' Van Ronk said. ``Bill Spencer
climbed up on the stage and balled the audience out. He said,
`There's something important going on here.' Bobby said it didn't
work. Everyone kept on talking. He was quite upset.''
   Lena had a backstage pass for Dylan's concert last summer at
Saratoga Performing Arts Center. She said they chatted and Dylan,
like he had 28 years before, fretted about that night's performance.
If anything, she's realistic about her place in his career.
   ``I don't credit myself with discovering any talent,'' Lena said.
``I credit myself with providing a place to perform early in a
career.
   ``I guess I've been doing the right thing. I'm still here.''

<HEAD>England's Second City Celebrates a Birthday and Economic Recovery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now England's second largest city,
Birmingham has been around for at least 900 years, but this year it
is celebrating a centennial and a new beginning.
   It is marking its recovery from a severe recession and hopes
people will forget what they thought about it before and take note
of what's good about it now.
   It was in 1889 that Queen Victoria, who had her own misgivings
about the place, granted Birmingham its city charter. That's the
reason for the centennial. But it is using the occasion to bury a
recession that wiped out more than 200,000 jobs and ravaged its
traditional metals industry.
   The city of 1.05 million, 100 miles northwest of London, is
hoping the year-long celebration, with more than 600 individual
events, also will clear away its image as a cultural wasteland and
sterile, concrete jungle.
   Birmingham-bashing is as old as the city itself.
   History books tell of Victoria drawing the shades of her royal
carriage to block out its industrial soot, gloom and grime when she
came here on her travels through the English midlands.
   In her 1816 novel ``Emma'' Jane Austen wrote: ``One has no great
hopes for Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the
sound.''
   ``Manufacturing used to be a very dirty industry,'' explained
Andrew Fretter, City Hall's principal marketing officer. ``It's not
anymore. People haven't yet adjusted to that new situation.''
   Birmingham has been a trading center for centuries, although the
Domesday Book of 1086 rated it one of the poorest in Warwickshire
County.
   It prospered during the 16th century as a finishing center and
marketing outlet for basic metal goods from the surrounding area and
is acknowledged to have been the birthplace of the Industrial
Revolution long before it became a city.
   As England's workshop, Birmingham attracted a rich diversity of
immigrants, primarily from Britain's farflung Empire, until the
recession struck in 1979. ``It hit hard,'' Fretter said. ``Vast
swathes in the city of Birmingham were left totally derelict.''
   ``The shakeout of the Birmingham economy was catastrophic, to say
the least,'' said Albert Bore, chairman of the economic development
committee of the Labor Party-controlled City Council.
   Birmingham's recovery was spurred by the council's sponsorship of
several megaprojects, including a modern science park and the
$215-million International Convention Center scheduled to open in
1991.
   It also spent the equivalent of $2.5 million on a bid to be the
host of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The bid failed _ Spain won out _
but it signified the new confidence of a city that only two years
ago came dead last in a survey of the quality of life in 38 British
cities.
   Besides its traditional prides and joys _ more canals than Venice
in Italy, Europe's largest public library, a rating as having the
best tap water of any big city in the world, even if it is piped
from Wales _ Birmingham is scheduling $2.5 billion for development.
   Manufacturing production has outstripped the previous record set
in 1979, 80 percent of manufacturers are working at more than 90
percent capacity and unemployment has fallen to 7.5 percent from
1982's peak of 16.8 percent.
   Herbert Austin set up his automobile works in the city's
Longbridge district in 1905 and pioneered the popular Austin 7.
Today, Birmingham holds Britain's only street-circuit car race, the
annual Super Prix, and the auto industry is once again the city's
largest employer, home to the Rover Group's modern robotic car plant
and the Austin Morris division of the British Leyland Motor Corp.
   Business travel to the city, streamlined by a modern
international airport, has helped create 73,000 jobs and has made
Birmingham the fifth most visited city in England. Visitors spent
the equivalent of $635 million here in 1987.
   ``Brummies,'' as Birmingham's residents are known, concede they
now must pay attention to how their city looks, as well as how it
works.
   In the 1960s, most of the city's Victorian heart was torn out and
replaced by featureless concrete and mirror glass buildings,
surrounded _ some say strangled _ by a beltway.
   It's architectural style is still symbolized by two of its best
known landmarks _ the Bull Ring, a covered shopping complex soon to
be replaced by a $688-million continental style arcade, and
Spaghetti Junction, a vast criss-crossing of roads, cloverleafs and
overpasses.
   The planners ``ripped the city apart in the '50s and '60s,'' Bore
said. ``The drive to clear the slums and to provide for the age of
the motor car lacked the sensitivity the planning community now
has.''
   The city has an eclectic mixture of performing arts: UB40, the
acclaimed multiracial rock group, comes from Birmingham; ``Spitting
Images,'' the wickedly satirical puppet show is produced here, and
Simon Rattle, the wunderkind of British conductors, has led the
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra since he was 25 years old.
   In a recent coup, the City Council lured the Sadler's Wells Royal
Ballet from London with a $10.3-million financing offer. The
traveling section of the Royal Ballet will move into the 1,950-seat
Hippodrome in August 1990.

<HEAD>For College Grads, It's Tough Finding a Job in Egypt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nahid Samir went to college and earned an
engineering degree. Today, she's a housekeeper-nanny.
   Mohamed studied business administration at Cairo University. He
drives a taxi.
   They're lucky; they have jobs.
   Other college graduates _ roughly a million by one official
estimate _ can't find any work at all, a situation that is
potentially explosive.
   Egyptian universities turn out 100,000 graduates a year. Many
find their dreams brutally shattered by a twin headaches in this
overpopulated country of 54 million: unemployment and
underemployment.
   Official estimates put Egypt's jobless rate at around 10 percent.
But another 10 percent are in ``jobs'' supplied to graduates under a
30-year-old government policy that pays almost nothing in wages but
requires little more of the job-holder than signing a work register.
   ``It is a high percentage without doubt,'' said Mokhtar
Abdel-Hamid of the governing National Democratic Party, head of the
labor committee in the People's Assembly, the national parliament.
``We are a developing nation and need the efforts of every person.
This high percentage can affect development.''
   For the first time, President Hosni Mubarak's government is
ringing the alarm bell and testing a variety of remedies.
   ``We do not need more people,'' Mubarak said in a recent speech.
``What we need is better planning and development of the educational
system, and connecting it to the needs of development.
   ``We hope the government will be able to open new fields for
(graduates) so we can destroy this unemployment phenomenon.''
   Proposed solutions include small-business loans for graduates or
selling them cheap desert land for agricultural reclamation. Opening
retraining centers also has been suggested, in hopes of turning
unemployed graduates into skilled tradesmen, who are much in demand.
   The employment problem is the result of several factors. Very
important is the mushrooming population, increasing by a million
every nine months. Also, the world oil glut that hit the economies
of the Persian Gulf countries brought home to Egypt's labor pool
hundreds of thousands of Egyptians whose jobs abroad had disappeared.
   Part of the problem lies with two policies left over from Gamal
Abdel Nasser's socialist Egypt of the 1950s and 1960s: free higher
education, which has created a surplus of university graduates and a
shortage of skilled laborers, and the promise of a job to any
graduate who can't find one in private business.
   By January 1989, the government was looking to find jobs for
people who graduated in June 1983.
   Egypt's economy is stagnant, encumbered by a $44-billion foreign
debt and high inflation.
   The People's Assembly has been discussing unemployment and
Mubarak himself is meeting with senior politicians in search of a
solution.
   ``Lots of things combined and led to this unemployment problem,''
the assembly's Abdel-Hamid said. He enumerated the main ones as
population growth, the large number of graduates, the lack of money
for building new factories to create jobs and the return of the
workers from the Persian Gulf oil fields.
   ``There has to be a study to know what the Egyptian market needs,
and then (we should) set education policies accordingly,''
Abdel-Hamid said. ``There also has to be more work on institutes or
junior colleges to teach certain skills that are needed like
carpentry and plumbing.''
   The Engineers' Union says 20,000 new engineers are looking for
jobs. Fewer new doctors than that are out of work, but a physician's
starting salary in a government hospital is 60 pounds ($25) a month.
   And with the present rate of population growth, 6 million new
job-seekers will enter the market in the next decade.

<HEAD>PBS Series Exposes Flaws in U.S. Education System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American education is laid bare in a landmark
television series virtually certain to leave viewers unsettled and
embarrassed.
   ``Learning In America,'' starting Monday night on PBS, is a
five-part, multimillion dollar look at what's happening in the
nation's classrooms, featuring Roger Mudd and three correspondents
from the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour.
   The portrait is always revealing, sometimes chilling.
   ``I don't want to graduate, to tell you the truth. It's just fun.
I like it,'' says a California high school senior interested mainly
in sports.
   ``I think it's my senior year and I'm going to relax,'' says his
friend, explaining why he's taking nutrition and lifestyle courses
instead of the math he needs to become a computer repairman.
   And from Denver high school teacher Martha Nagel: ``This is a job
that breaks your heart every day.''
   The makers of ``Learning in America'' roved from California to
East Harlem, from Ireland to Japan, to paint a broad television
canvas unusual in the far-flung, locally controlled education field.
   ``The reason education doesn't get covered well on TV is that
it's so decentralized. Finding out about what's going on is very
time-consuming,'' said Joe Quinlan, executive producer of the series.
   Chrysler Corp. put up nearly $4 million for the series, equally
divided between production and promotion, and had nothing to do with
content. A number of other companies were also interested in
financing the project, Quinlan said.
   ``That's one indicator of the anxiety levels of American
business,'' he said. ``American business is in shock right now''
about the state of the education system.
   A shocker in the first section of the series is the revelation
that New York Life of Freehold, N.J. is shipping thousands of
medical claims to a rural Irish town to be processed. A personnel
officer of the company said she can't find enough competent,
motivated high school graduates close to home to fill her workforce.
   Mudd, who taught for a year at a private boys school before going
into journalism, said in an interview that the two students drifting
through high school ``are probably generally typical of that big
group of kids between the gifted and the slow. The top and the
bottom get all the attention. It's the middle group that's
worrisome.''
   Mudd noted the boys' plans to attend a free, open-admissions
junior college and remarked: ``In one year they'll try to learn the
stuff they didn't learn because they'd been playing for four years,
and of course the taxpayers will have to foot that bill.''
   In fairness to the boys, the series notes that U.S. schools don't
have clear goals and expectations for middle-range students. This is
contrasted with Japan, where all students are expected to be
serious, disciplined and solidly prepared for their futures.
   Another key point is that Japanese parents are totally involved
in their children's education, while U.S. parents are more likely to
be locked in a consuming struggle for economic survival.
   ``The main thing I noticed (in making the series) was how fast
the American family has changed and how far we all are behind in
responding to that, not just the schools but the whole society,''
Quinlan said. He cited women in the workplace, divorce rates and
single-parent families, latch-key kids and students working 30 hours
a week after school. ``It really hit home _ we're not in Kansas
anymore, Toto,'' Quinlan said.
   The most disturbing parts of the series examine inequities in
American schools and problems in the teaching profession. Nagel is
shown trying to call her gynecologist from a public phone; a 23-year
veteran doesn't have his own classroom; an incompetent teacher is
fired and then hired within hours by another principal who never
bothered to call for a reference.
   Mudd said he came away from the series ``agitated but not
depressed, because enough places are in fact doing something and
doing it well.'' But correspondent John Merrow, a former teacher who
holds a Harvard Ph.D. in education, said the successful formulas at
such schools most often are ignored elsewhere.
   ``All these terrific things that happen, they are not copied,''
Merrow said in an interview. ``There are some very hopeful signs.
The question is, is progress being made at a fast enough rate to
keep us from going into the dumpster?''

<TEXT>
   Maybe it's the immaculate rows of
discounted shampoo and paper towels, or the doorside hand-pumping
``people greeters'' who make visitors feel like they've entered a
sprawling mom-and-pop corner store.
   If the 97,000-square foot Waxahachie Wal-Mart is any indication
of the discount chain's operations in 26 states, it's not hard to
see why Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has staked a claim as the country's
dominant retailer, pleasing customers and sending nervous ripples
into the boardrooms of competitors.
   ``As for Wal-Mart becoming a household word, we never think about
things like that,'' David Glass, president and chief operating
officer, said in a telephone interview from company headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark. ``What we want is for customers in our territories
to think of us fondly.''
   Local shopkeepers as well as giants like Sears, Roebuck and Co.
are watching Wal-Marts spurt like weeds and wondering whether some
of their business could be choked by a rival that religiously
pursues its corporate strategy with the fervor of a rural evangelist.
   Wal-Mart took root when Sam Walton and his brother Bud founded
the first Wal-Mart Discount City in Rogers, Ark. in 1962.
   Under Sam Walton, the company expanded in the 1970s and 1980s,
making his family worth billions and vaulting Wal-Mart to the
third-biggest U.S. retailer behind No.1 Sears and second-ranked K
mart Corp.
   At 70, Sam Walton remains involved. He has retained the title of
chairman although the company's day-to-day operations are handled by
Glass, 53.
   A visitor to a Wal-Mart immediately senses workers are aiming to
foster a friendly image, as though trying to preserve the charm
historically associated with the neighborhood shops that many retail
chains now threaten.
   When customers step inside an official greeter, sometimes in the
form of a hand-clasping retiree, ushers them in, offering advice or
just a ``how-do-you-do.''
   Regular Wal-Mart stores attempt to provide one-stop shopping for
consumers, stocking basic neccesities ranging from shoes and clothes
to televisions and outdoor grills.
   Three Wal-Mart supercenters and three hypermarts, marketing
experiments that are attracting hordes of customers, offer a wider
array of merchandise, such as full grocery lines.
   Within the Wal-Mart in Waxahachie, a community about 25 miles
south of Dallas, everything appears tidy with merchandise in its
proper place, typical of Wal-Marts elsewhere.
   Workers known as ``associates'' in the corporate patois, patrol
the floor, retrieving hangers, unwanted items and the clutter that
bargain-hunters sometimes leave behind.
   One of Waxahachie's assistant managers, Millie Wall, says
Wal-Mart encourages associates to be helpful. ``It might be beyond
what other discount stores do but I don't think it's beyond
Wal-Mart,'' she says.
   What really draws customers, though, is price.
   ``You can find the same stuff at Wal-Mart that you can find at
other stores but cheaper,'' says Wal-Mart regular Cheryl Starks
while lunching with three of her four children at a McDonald's near
the Wal-Mart in the east Texas town of Gilmer. ``The clothes we have
on came from Wal-Mart, the shoes we have on came from Wal-Mart.''
   In the Wal-Mart she frequents, a 16 ounce bottle of Suave balsam
and protein shampoo was selling for $1.08 while the supermarket a
few doors away in the same mall offered the same for $1.69. Four
rolls of Charmin toilet tissue went for 96 cents in Wal-Mart vs.
$1.45 at the supermarket. Bounty designer kitchen towels were 78
cents in Wal-Mart and $1.07 in the store nearby.
   Wal-Mart's flag-waving patriotism also seems to have struck a
responsive chord in the small towns and cities in the heartland,
where the chain has multiplied. Anecdotal evidence suggests the
company has won customers through publicity programs such as its
``Buy American'' pitch.
   If there's one big criticism, it's that local merchants _
especially small shops that can't buy in the volume that allows
Wal-Mart to keep prices low _ get blown away when Wal-Marts move in.
   Kenneth E. Stone, an economics professor at Iowa State
University, looked into the impact of Wal-Marts after chambers of
commerce and business people expressed concern about the
consequences of new Wal-Marts in their areas.
   Stone's conclusions were mixed. Retail trade will expand,
boosting business for some local merchants but causing others to
lose sales, he found.
   The bottom line, Stone's study shows, is that a strategy should
be developed ``for existing merchants so that they may better
co-exist in a Wal-Mart environment.''
   Glass concedes Wal-Marts can make big economic waves. He says
some businesses may flee from their competitive might, but overall,
the chain tends to benefit areas by drawing customers to many stores.
   ``In the aggregate, I would argue that we have a good impact on a
community by making it a trade center, a place where people come to
shop,'' he says.
   Wall Streeters praise Wal-Mart, especially the chain's
application of computer technology to most routine retailing tasks,
including inventory control.
   The past decade is the best evidence of Wal-Mart's phenomenal
growth. As of Jan. 31, the company ran 1,259 Wal-Mart stores, 105
Sam's Wholesale Clubs _ outlets for shoppers buying in bulk _ and
about two dozen other retail operations. At the start of 1979,
Wal-Mart ran 276 stores.
   This year, the company plans to open 155 Wal-Marts and 20
wholesale clubs. The opening of new stores has helped maintain
momentum in sales growth, which was 29 percent in 1988 when sales
rose to $20.65 billion from $15.96 billion.
   Earnings last year totaled $837 million, or $1.48 a share, vs.
$628 million or $1.11 a share a year earlier.
   The company's ambitious plans have expanded to the concept of
supercenters and hypermarts, which are huge mega-merchandizing
emporia with everything from groceries to computer software under
one roof.
   Judging from Wal-Mart's stock market performance, the company has
faithful followers. One analyst estimates the price of a Wal-Mart
share will rise to $49 this year from about $32 recently.
   On the cost side, the corporation is known for dealing shrewdly
with suppliers for the best possible price. Its operating expenses,
as a proportion of sales, are the lowest industrywide.
   In a recent report on the company, Walter F. Loeb of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. had nothing bad to say.
   ``The customer is key to the success of Wal-Mart. Management is
insisting that every customer be treated as a guest in Wal-Mart
stores,'' Loeb wrote.
   ``This unique attitude is producing a strong response from
consumers since service with a smile is often a forgotten commodity
in retailing.''

   In the Wal-Mart parking lot, a car radio
plays a country ballad about a relaxed, ``porch swing state of
mind.'' Outside the store's entrance, a vendor sells corn dogs and
cold soda.
   Nearby, a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off
the small merry-go-round; two rides are enough, she says, ``Mommy's
got to go shopping now.''
   Reluctantly, the little girl dismounts and tags along into the
store. Her pout gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets the
child with a ``Hi honey!'' while fixing a happy-face sticker on her
hand.
   Anyone entering the Wal-Mart in this east Texas town _ and
Wal-Marts elsewhere _ encounters such a person. The people greeters
welcome shoppers, give advice on where to find things and mark
merchandise carried in for returns or exchanges.
   On the way out of some Wal-Marts, exit greeters thank people for
coming while keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure people
aren't shoplifting.
   The people-greeting practice is one of many ingredients in
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s highly successful retailing recipe.
   Staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other
retailers, particularly at discounters that have heavy traffic. What
sets Wal-Marts appart is the way they handle the task.
   Customers in some high-volume stores feel bullied by employees
demanding that they reveal the contents of parcels, for instance.
Not in Wal-Marts.
   Wal-Mart ``associates,'' the term the company has substituted for
employees, give the impression that the security element of
people-greeting is secondary to acting like a friendly host or
hostess. They appear to genuinely enjoy passing the time with
patrons.
   ``I get to see everybody who comes to Wal-Mart and everybody in
Upshur County comes to Wal-Mart sooner or later,'' says Peggy Smith
while on duty at the entrance of the Gilmer Wal-Mart.
   Smith, a 39-year-old Gilmer resident who won an award for being
the most courteous employee in the county in February, speaks
proudly about working at Wal-Mart.
   She's grateful to have the job. Other people living in the area
of Gilmer, a town of an estimated 6,500 people about 120 miles east
of Dallas and the Upshur County seat, are less fortunate due to deep
staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged slump in the
state's oil industry.
   Wal-Mart store managers say not all associates are suited for
people-greeting duty. Besides friendliness and maturity, useful
personality traits are patience and perhaps a touch of
inquisitiveness, some say.
   Retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found
doing stints on Wal-Mart's hospitality patrol.
   One of them, 68-year-old Jack Butler, says being a people greeter
at the Wal-Mart in Duncanville, Texas, fits his needs fine. After
20{ years working in the warehouse of a tractor company, he enjoys
less physically-demanding work.
   Deploying someone at Wal-Mart doors originated with one of the
hourly associates. Sam Walton, company founder and chairman, liked
the suggestion and it became a company-wide practice.

   The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this
community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an
insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing
phenomenon.
   Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary
telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby
airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring
him to the De Soto store.
   Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in
close touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed by
other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of
time in the field.
   Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas
metropolitan area, ``It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,'
because they're always out.''
   By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations
throughout the company.
   Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer
David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the
gospel according to Sam, as he is called.
   To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing, ``Rule No.1 is
the customer is always right. Rule No.2 says just in case the
customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.''
   If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are
because that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.
   He shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on him
and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.
   He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.
   He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart ``associates'' that
hospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or via
high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.
   Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company
effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union
organizing effort in the late 1960s.
   One of the most sensitive subjects for Walton is the fortune he's
amassed.
   A close associate says Sam would ``probably give anything'' not
to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest
people. The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake
in Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.
   ``Sam Walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his
bank account,'' says Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.
   Samuel Moore Walton turns 71 on March 29. He was born in
Kingfisher, Okla., and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.
   He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economics
degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee in
Des Moines, Iowa. After serving three years in the Army, he went to
Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually
becoming the company's biggest franchisee.
   The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his
brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in
1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S.
retail trade.
   Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.
Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had are
involved with the company in various capacities.
   Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as
ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with
leukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office since
handing over most responsiblities to David Glass. Sam is still
chairman of the board.
   Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourish
without Sam. The answer is an emphatic yes because, he says, ``We
have great people.'' The Walton family will always be involved, he
adds.
   Commenting on the future, Glass says: ``We'll be judged on what
we produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won't
matter.''

<TEXT>
   In 1848, Richard Wagner had just completed the
scoring for ``Lohengrin'' when the idea for a work on the Nibelung _
dwarfs who owned a magic ring and a horde of gold _ began to
crystallize.
   Twenty-eight years later, he put the final touches on the score
of ``Der Ring des Nibelungen'' (``The Ring of the Nibelungen''). It
was a staggering accomplishment at the time and remains so today.
   Two major companies are about to meet the most difficult
challenge in the world of opera _ producing Wagner's Ring, 17 hours
of music originally intended by Wagner to be performed over four
days.
   The Metropolitan Opera will perform the entire epic about love
and greed and gods and goddesses three times in the next few weeks _
the first time it has presented it in so short a span in 90 years.
The Berlin Opera is bringing its version to Washington's Kennedy
Center in June.
   Wagner deliberately made his Ring inaccessible to most theaters
of the day, and he created an opera house in Bayreuth, Germany, in
1876 to show the work.
   ``I no longer gave a thought to the Dresden or any other court
theater in the world; my sole preoccupation was to produce something
that should free me, once and for all, from this irrational
subservience,'' the composer wrote in his autobiography.
   Few opera companies perform the four works _ ``Das Rheingold,''
``Die Walkure,'' ``Siegfried'' and ``Gotterdammerung'' _ in four
days. Usually, the operas are seen singularly, or if produced as a
ring cycle, are stretched out over weeks or months.
   ``Clearly Wagner knew what he was doing,'' said Speight Jenkins,
general director of the Seattle Opera. ``For the sake of the power
of it, it needs to go the way it was meant to go.''
   Seattle started an annual Ring cycle in 1975. It isn't performing
it this year because of the other two productions.
   Both productions are selling out, as Wagner buffs from around the
world scramble to attend one or both. At the Met, tickets for all
four operas range from $60 to $620. Tickets at the Kennedy Center
range from $120 to $380. The first cycle in Washington is June 2.
The first Met cycle starts April 1. All will be broadcast live on
radio.
   The Met's new production is the most traditional in the world.
The rocky mountain top where Brunnhilde, surrounded by a circle of
fire, is put into a deep sleep by her father, Wotan, resembles a
craggy peak. But the production departs from the very earliest
traditional stagings by eliminating her horse and not having the
Valkyries actually fly.
   Berlin's Ring, new in 1985, is set in a futuristic tunnel
designed by Peter Sykora. It was staged by Gotz Friedrich. Costumes
are contemporary with punk underpinnings. In ``Das Rheingold,'' for
example, Alberich is clothed in a diving suit with air hoses. And
Brunnhilde wears black leather and leather boots in the later operas.
   ``It's very modern. It is hot, especially with the lighting of
the stage. But it looks quite snazzy,'' said Dame Gwyneth Jones, who
sang Brunnhilde for Berlin in Japan last fall.
   ``It shows the personal, psychological relationships between the
persons in the Ring. It is a human Ring. It's not political at
all,'' said Jesus Lopez-Cobos, general director of the Berlin Opera.
   ``The idea is that every end is a new beginning. At the beginning
of the Ring you see a vision from the very end, and at the very end
you see once more the first picture of `Rheingold.' It is life,
going over and over.''
   At Bayreuth in 1976 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
opera house Wagner built, Pierre Boulez conducted and Patrice
Chereau staged the first Ring ever taped for television. The Chereau
Ring is a comment on corruption brought by industrialization.
Instead of three mermaids swimming around, ``Rheingold'' starts with
three prostitutes near a hydroelectric dam.
   In the Seattle production, Wotan is a stage director whose actors
get out of hand. ``It's the only untraditional cycle in America,''
Seattle's Jenkins said. ``We try to be as mythic as possible. I
think we follow very faithfully the words of the text and pay no
attention to the stage instructions of Wagner.'' The San Francisco
Opera is the only other American company performing a Ring.
   In 1985, when it was new, Seattle's unconventional Ring caused
fistfights at cocktail parties. By 1987, it was accepted and sold
out.
   Jenkins likes innovative approaches to staging the ``Ring.'' So
does Lopez-Cobos, who's conducting the first cycle in Washington.
   ``Sometimes they go too far,'' Lopez-Cobos said. ``I prefer to
take the risk. You are sometimes inspired by new and interesting
concepts on the stage.''
   Dame Gwyneth will sing Brunnhilde in the Met's third cycle. Next
fall she'll sing in a Ring at the San Francisco Opera and in a new
``Die Walkure'' at Covent Garden. The Welsh soprano has sung in a
lot of Rings, including the televised Bayreuth cycle.
   One problem with the Ring in the latter half of this century has
been that Hitler liked it and considered it a glorification of a
master race. Throughout its history it's story has been the subject
of differing and often bizarre interpretations. The music, though,
is another matter.
   In 1969, Milton Cross, the late commentator on the Met's Saturday
afternoon radio broadcasts, wrote that the music's greatness and
majesty present the ``conflicts, tenderness, grandeur, heroism,
passion and a tragedy that stirs us to the depths of our beings.''
   Wagner's grandson, Wieland Wagner, made a fresh start at Bayreuth
in 1951 _ the first postwar Ring. With an almost barren stage, he
stressed symbolism, thereby triggering the interpretive productions
which have followed.
   Both the Met's and Berlin's current Rings replaced productions
based on Wieland Wagner's. At the Met in 1975, the stage showed a
ring shape _ a giant, tilted, flat doughnut _ with singers in
costumes resembling dark choir robes. The lighting, mainly dark
blue, set the psychological moods.
   The shortest amount of time in which one could attend all four
operas in that 1975 Met Ring production was six weeks.
   The Met chose a traditional Ring, said artistic administrator
Jonathan Friend, because its audience prefers it. ``If you make a
mistake with the Ring, it is a very expensive mistake. The more
stylized a production is, the more difficult to get a larger
proportion of our public to accept it.
   ``In some of the stylized productions, the text and music are at
a complete opposite to what you're seeing on stage. Some would
rather see something unusual. Here, we would rather go the other
way.''
   James Levine, who conducts the Met's Ring, chose Otto Schenk to
create the production and suggested Gunther Schneider-Siemssen as
set designer.
   ``We knew Schenk would do something that was naturalistic,
romantic and warm without any particularly strong external idea
pushed onto the opera,'' Friend said.
   New York cast members include Toni Kraemer and William Johns as
Siegfried, Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, Gary Lakes as Siegmund,
Christa Ludwig as Fricka and Waltraute and Matti Salminen as Hagen.
   The two Brunnhildes in Washington will be Ute Vinzing and Anne
Evans. Rene Kollo will sing Siegfried and Peter Hofmann will sing
Siegmund. Wotan will be Robert Hale and Simon Estes, singing a cycle
each.

<HEAD>Gingrich Choice by GOP May Crimp Bush's Bipartisanship</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was intramural politics, an election settled
by a bare majority of a chronic minority.
   But the leadership choice House Republicans made last Wednesday
may change the way both parties do business in Congress, and could
put a crimp in President Bush's new-look bipartisanship.
   The House GOP judgment seems to be that if they can't make laws,
at least they can make noise.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, newly elected as the assistant
Republican leader of the House, clearly intends to do just that.
Gingrich, loudly conservative, said he will build a more aggressive,
activist party.
   That is not the traditional task of the party whip, a job title
that traces to Parliament and was around before Congress was. The
whip's task is to line up votes, count heads, try to make sure his
party's supporters are on hand when the roll is called.
   The best of them deal in the favors and compromises that oil any
legislative machinery. It's a doubly difficult assignment when
undertaken for the programs of a Republican administration in an
overwhelmingly Democratic House.
   But compromise is not Gingrich's style. And he says the party
wanted a new job description when he was chosen whip, 87 to 85, over
Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois. He also says that his primary
assignment is to work for House Republicans, not necessarily for
President Bush.
   Indeed, Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, said
after Gingrich was chosen that he may have to take on some of the
vote-counting and other duties that normally go to the whip.
Michel's new deputy has no practice in those assignments.
   Gingrich and his conservative allies argue that the way toward a
Republican resurgence in the House is confrontation, not compromise.
They say that House GOP leaders have been too tractable and too
anxious to get along with the Democratic majority.
   By now it seems a permanent majority, especially to frustrated
political warriors like Gingrich. Republicans haven't controlled the
House in 34 years, going on 35. The House lineup _ now 258
Democrats, 174 Republicans, with three seats vacant _ is determined
in 435 separate elections every other year. National issues, trends
and tickets affect those contests. State and regional issues,
personalities and, above all, incumbency, affect them, too.
   The Gingrich game plan is based on the theory that the national
side of that political equation can become the base for a Republican
revival. That's in tune with the aggressive outlook of new leaders
at the Republican National Committee and the party's Congressional
Campaign Committee.
   It carries risks. Controlling Congress, Democrats also control
many of the perks, projects and federal favors that members of
Congress seek for their districts and their constituents. Those are
vital ingredients in the local side of a campaign for Congress. They
can be punishing weapons _ a House member needs to be able to
deliver for the voters back home.
   Former Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., an old
Gingrich foe, always counseled that all politics is local. Gingrich
and company are on the opposite track, contending that the House can
be won back on the strength of national Republican issues.
   The proof, if there is any, will be a long time coming, with an
84-seat Democratic margin which actually widened by three seats
while Republicans were winning the presidency in 1988. The White
House party usually loses House seats in off-year elections like
those coming in 1990.
   Time and again during their minority decades, House Republicans
have looked to new leaders to change their lot. Rep. Charles A.
Halleck of Indiana ousted Rep. Joseph W. Martin Jr. as minority
leader in 1959, saying he offered new, vigorous leadership. Six
years later, in another uprising, Rep. Gerald R. Ford of Michigan
was elected leader, saying the party wanted new leadership, a new
image and positive programs to counter the Democrats. When Michel
was promoted from whip to leader in 1980, he said ``We're going to
take the offensive.''
   Now Gingrich says he'll do all that and more from the No. 2 job,
although he obviously has his eye on the leadership.

   The Commerce Department reported orders to
factories for durable goods declined for the second straight month
in February, another sign the economy is losing steam.
   Orders fell 3.6 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted
$123.7 billion after dropping 2.9 percent in January, the first
back-to-back declines in three years and the steepest drops since a
7.4 percent dive last July. Most analysts had been expecting a
modest increase.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said recent economic reports provide the first visible evidence of
accelerating price increases, supporting the central bank's policy
of driving up interest rates.
   But, in response to a question Wednesday at a House Banking
subcommittee hearing, he said the conditions that led to interest
rates in the high teens in the early 1980s are not present today.
   Greenspan defended the central bank's year-long program of what
he described as aggressive credit tightening, which has pumped up
short-term interest rates by more than 3 percentage points to about
9 percent.

   While the survey was skewed to S&amp;Ls with the worst problems _ the

<BYLINE>Inflation Control, Another Import From Japan? ^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the producer price index showed a big
increase the other day it was as if a million Americans had shouted
``fire.''
   Among those millions were investors, whose nervous systems had
been imprinted by years of inflation fears. Believing inflation is
ruinous for stocks, they nearly proved the thesis, knocking the
averages for a loop.
   Economists, many of whom had been waiting at least two years for
the inflation event, having prematurely forecast its onset, took
bows and sent overnight letters to their clients saying, ``I told
you so.''
   The media joined in the excitement, dutifully finding ``experts''
who could identify the causes of the inflation problem and explain
what damage might be expected _ that is, a recession, rising
unemployment and the like.
   Then the consumer price index was released.
   The numbers in this report were much lower or, as some headlines
stated, ``more modest'' than the bawdy producer prices. The
president said he was encouraged. An economist declared the
inflation numbers had returned to sanity.
   The departure from sanity was of course not in the brainless
numbers but in the interpretation by humans. And what that
interpretation showed is that when you expect inflation, almost any
sign is an inflation sign.
   Americans have been under great stress for at least two years
now, reminded almost daily that an expansion that lasts 77 months,
as this one has, is destined to be consumed at almost any time by
the fires of inflation.
   The explanations:
   You cannot work your production facilities at the very high rate
of 85 percent of capacity without adding to prices, because
increasingly you are bringing onto line the least efficient plants
and equipment.
   And you cannot drop the jobless rate to near 5 percent without
dipping into a labor pool of inexperienced and inefficient, and
therefore costly and unproductive, workers. Moreover, with labor in
short supply, wages must rise.
   Is that so? It might be. It might not.
   So many inflation-recession theories have been expounded that one
has to question them all. Most of them can be logically presented.
Many of them have merit, but a good many of them also leave
something unexplained.
   If the most popular explanation is correct _ the one that says
inflation is growing because of stress on job markets and plant
capacity _ how do you explain the Japanese experience?
   Japan's unemployment rate is about half the American rate, which
is somewhere just above 5 percent a year. And Japan's capacity
utilization rate is only a couple of percentage points below the
U.S. rate.
   In addition, its money supply growth rate often has exceeded the
U.S. money growth rate, the high level of which also has been named
as a factor in inflation. And its budget deficit has sometimes been
worse than America's.
   Those four factors _ high plant utilization, low jobless rate,
fast money supply growth and big budget deficits _ are probably the
four most popular explanations for present and future inflation.
   Many of the economists who use these factors to explain U.S.
inflation, and who forecast a recession for Americans this year,
have little to say of the Japanese anomaly. It is, it seems, another
impenetrable Oriental mystery.
   It is true that the Japanese have a high savings rate. And that
those savings help finance larger and more efficient production. And
that the Japanese are hard workers. But there is more to it than
that.
   The explanation could be the most beneficial Japanese import of
all, better than cars, cameras, TVs, VCRs and computers.

   The government said it will try GAF Corp. and a
top executive for a third time on stock fraud charges despite a
mistrial that defense lawyers called a major setback in the pursuit
of Wall Street corruption.
   ``We still have a great deal of faith in our evidence in this
case,'' U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said Wednesday after a federal
judge declared her second mistrial. ``It's appropriate to try the
case again.''
   The GAF case was the first criminal trial stemming from the
insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s and considered a critical
test of information supplied by jailed stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky.
   After 12 days and more than 90 hours of deliberations, the jury
of nine women and three men in federal court in Manhattan said they
were hopelessly deadlocked in a three-way split and U.S. District
Judge Mary Johnson Lowe declared the mistrial.
   On Jan. 10 Lowe declared a mistrial after determining prosecutors
unintentionally withheld an expert's report that a key piece of
evidence had been altered.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin were
indicted last July for allegedly trying to boost Union Carbide
Corp.'s stock price in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of
Carbide shares. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire
fraud and conspiracy.
   GAF is a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materials
manufacturer with operations worldwide. Its chairman, Samuel J.
Heyman, was named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in
the case.
   Sherwin, 55, of Princeton, N.J., hugged his wife as the mistrial
was announced. Sweating profusely, he told reporters outside the
courtroom, ``My family and I are all just completely exhausted.''
   The government had made GAF its leadoff case in a series of
trials scheduled for this year that hinge on the confessions and
testimony of Wall Street figures who already have admitted
securities law violations.
   Defense lawyers said they would fight any move by the government
to retry the case.
   ``If a jury cannot agree despite 12 days of patient deliberations
I believe it's a waste of resources to continue to try this case,''
lead GAF attorney Arthur T. Liman said.
   Wall Street securities fraud lawyer Stanley Arkin said the
mistrial indicated the government was failing in its attempt to
bring criminal charges in what should be civil cases.
   ``I don't think this case demonstrated any harm,'' he said. ``It
never seemed to me like a criminal case and I don't think it is.''
   Romano denied that the mistrial marked a defeat for the Manhattan
U.S. attorney's office, which has brought charges in more than 50
securities fraud cases since 1983.
   All prior criminal frauds, including pending charges against the
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., were settled through
plea bargains. Drexel agreed in December to settle securities fraud
charges unrelated to the GAF case by pleading guilty to six felonies
and paying a record $650 million.
   In a separate development, the government on Wednesday obtained
its first conviction in a Drexel-related case as a jury convicted
former Drexel assistant trader Lisa Jones of perjury and obstruction
of justice.
   The government's case against GAF was based largely on the
testimony of Los Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies, an admitted felon
expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as part
of a plea arrangement with the government.
   The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize
GAF's profits from the planned sale of a large block of Union
Carbide stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemical
concern earlier in 1986.
   Defense lawyers branded Jefferies a crook who had schemed
illegally with Boesky, who paid $100 million to settle insider
trading charges in late 1986. Boesky fingered Jefferies, 58, who
last year agreed to plead guilty to two securities law violations.
   Jefferies' testimony is seen as crucial to separate
Boesky-derived cases against speculator Salim B. Lewis and takeover
specialist Paul Bilzerian.
   On the ninth day of deliberations, the jury reported an 11-1
split but resumed discussions after the judge asked them to
reconsider their positions in the interests of reaching a verdict.
   It was not known whether the lone juror was for acquittal or
conviction, but some jurors clearly changed their minds, leading to
the three-way deadlock.
   GAF and the two subsidiaries faced maximum fines totaling $12
million, or $500,000 on each of eight counts against each of the
three. Sherwin faced 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $2
million.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Young Drexel Employee Guilty of Perjury</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The perjury conviction of a young assistant bond
trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will help the government's
ongoing investigation of the powerful Wall Street investment firm,
prosecutors said.
   A federal jury found Lisa Jones, 26, guilty of perjury and
obstruction of justice Wednesday in a case with links to the
government's most prominent target: multimillionaire Drexel bond
financier Michael Milken.
   Jones, a one-time runaway who climbed to a $100,000-a-year job at
the giant brokerage firm, faces a total of 35 years in jail and a
maximum fine of $1.75 million. Sentencing was set for May 22.
   It was the first trial of a Drexel employee after more than two
years of investigations.
   Defense lawyers alleged that the government overzealously
prosecuted Jones, who was charged with lying to a federal grand jury
about alleged shady stock deals involving Drexel and
Princeton-Newport LP, a now-defunct New Jersey securities firm whose
partners face racketeering charges.
   Jones, who made $117,000 last year and still is on Drexel's
payroll, worked for former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg, one of
the Princeton-Newport defendants, who in turn reported directly to
Milken. Milken has been informed by the government to expect to be
indicted on fraud and racketeering charges.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the Jones conviction, which did
not involved securities law violations, would nonetheless help
future cases. ``I think perjury convictions help all law enforcement
investigations,'' he said.
   ``I think (this case) is a tragedy because this defendant didn't
or couldn't understand what was required of her and could have
avoided this but didn't,'' Romano added.
   Defense lawyer Brian O'Neill said he would appeal the verdict. He
equated Jones to a ``little person run down by a truck.''
   During the trial, Jones broke down repeatedly on the stand as she
was grilled about her life and the grand jury testimony on her work
as an assistant trader at Drexel's Beverly, Hills, Calif.,
high-yield junk bond department. Her job included placing orders and
writing up trading tickets.
   To help prove their case, prosecutors showed Jones lied about her
age, marital status, birthplace and education.
   Jones told a federal grand jury in January 1988 she didn't recall
any discussions about stock ``parking'' _ when one investor buys
stock for another to conceal its true ownership _ in her contacts
with Princeton-Newport.
   Parking isn't illegal, but the government is seeking to
demonstrate that such deals violate securities laws if conducted
with fraud in mind.
   Prosecutors showed Jones handled transactions in which
Princeton-Newport sold securities to Drexel and repurchased them at
a prearranged price 31 days later. They claim the deals were
designed so Princeton-Newport could retain ownership while claiming
losses for tax purposes.
   The government's star witness in the Jones trial, William Ward
Hale, a former junior trader at Princeton-Newport, testified that he
and Jones parked stocks in 1985 and knew it was illegal.
   The link is considered important. Hale is expected to testify
against Princeton-Newport and possibly Milken about the questionable
trades.
   Jones' lawyer maintained she didn't know what parking was,
couldn't remember every trade she executed during eight years at
Drexel and was bullied by government investigators who knocked on
her door in late 1987 in connection with the Princeton-Newport probe.
   Princeton-Newport defense attorneys said they doubt the Jones
case will have any direct impact on their trial, set for June 5,
other than showcasing Hale as a witness.
   They also chastised the government for its treatment of Jones,
who they said revealed little that would would help make
racketeering charges stick.
   ``For all practical purposes, her credibility has been so
destroyed that it is unlikely she will ever be used as a witness by
either side,'' said Ted Wells, who represents Princeton-Newport
partner James S. Regan. ``She is a tragic figure caught in the
middle.''
   The Jones case has no direct bearing on the government's
settlement with Drexel over complaints stemming from information
supplied by now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky. The firm agreed
to pay $650 million and plead guilty to six felonies to settle
criminal fraud charges.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm had not decided
whether Jones will be fired. She was on a paid leave of absence from
Drexel, which paid her legal fees.

   Eyes, not instruments, are the best detectors of
airplane structural problems, according to members of a task force
trying to determine how to ensure the safety of the nation's aging
aircraft fleet.
   ``The most important thing you can do today is to be around an
airplane and be alert,'' said Ben Cosgrove, engineering vice
president of Boeing Co., whose planes have been involved in some
widely publicized incidents involving structural failure.
   ``Eighty percent of all damage is found by eyeballs,'' he said.
   Cosgrove, and other members of the task force formed by the Air
Transport Association spoke Wednesday at an aircraft maintenance and
ground support trade show in Dallas.
   The task force was formed last year after a section of fuselage
ripped off a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 over Hawaii. A
flight attendant was killed and 61 people were injured in the
incident, which focused public attention on the increasing age of
the nation's airplanes.
   There have been several other highly publicized incidents
recently, the most serious also occuring over Hawaii and involving a
Boeing plane.
   Last month, a section of the fuselage of a United Airlines Boeing
747 tore off just after the plane left Hawaii. Nine people died when
they were sucked out of the airliner.
   ``Current economic and market conditions have resulted in the use
of airplanes beyond their original economic design goal,'' said
Clyde Kizer, engineering and maintenance vice president of the Air
Transport Association.
   While the public has become aware of the age of the planes,
estimated to average 12.7 years, the United executive who chaired
the task force said age alone has little to do with an airplane's
airworthiness.
   The number of flights, the environment in which the planes
operate, and the attention paid to regular maintenance are more
important factors, said Bob Doll, United's vice president for
technical services.
   ``I don't see why there would be'' a limit to the operational age
of an aircraft, providing it is properly maintained, he said.
   Boeing's Cosgrove said the company has inspected 20-year-old
aircraft that look as if they just rolled off the assembly line, and
other, much younger aircraft in much worse shape.
   ``It's really down to the guts of an airline's organization,''
Cosgrove said. ``Inspection and maintainence of an aircraft, whether
it is one year or 20 years old, is important.''
   Whether closer visual inspection would have averted the Aloha
disaster is unclear, indicated Joseph Trippe Nall, the National
Transportation Safety Board member who is leading the investigation.
   Nall, in a separate speech Wednesday, said investigators found
stress fractures around screw holes near the damaged area of the
Boeing's fuselage.
   As a result, the NTSB _ although not ready to release its full
findings _ already has recommended some screw holes be redesigned on
the 737s to change their stress point.
   Nall said the NTSB's Aloha findings likely will be released May 9
when the board has its next regular meeting.
   Meanwhile, Doll said the task force was concerned about the
varied levels of maintenance practices it found throughout the
industry.
   Although he defended United's inspectors, Doll said the task
force was working on how to raise expertise industrywide.
   Doll balked at one questioner's suggestion that it would be
better to replace old aircraft rather than update them.
   ``If we pay $130 million (for a new plane) every time the
ashtrays get dirty, you're not going to be able to afford the
ticket,'' he said.
   Industry experts estimate that only about 15 jetliners have been
scrapped voluntarily by the airlines during the last decade.
   In the meantime, airlines are rapidly buying planes, but Doll
noted that most of the planes are being used for expansion and not
replacement of older aircraft.
   The NTSB's Nall stressed that training and following regulations
are the best ways to keep airplanes safe.

   Boeing Co., which has spent much of its time
lately fielding questions about aircraft quality, has plenty of good
news for a change: two major new aircraft orders and prospects of
record employment.
   American Airlines announced in New York Wednesday it was ordering
35 Boeing jetliners, along with up to 150 Fokker-100 short-haul
jets. Boeing's share of that order is worth an estimated $1.8
billion to $2.1 billion.
   Meanwhile, Boeing Canada's de Havilland Division said it received
its largest order ever, a $425 million deal from GPA Jetprop Ltd.
for 38 Dash 8 Series 300 turboprop planes.
   And Tuesday, Boeing said it planned to add 2,300 employees in the
first half of 1989, with mid-year employment in Washington state
reaching a company-record 102,000.
   Boeing currently employs 99,700 people in the state and 155,000
worldwide.
   The company has endured a rash of bad news recently, including
reports of miswiring in some jets, delays in its new 747-400 jumbo
jet, questions about the safety of older aircraft, and a series of
crashes and mishaps involving Boeing aircraft.
   But the tone at Boeing Commercial Airplanes was distinctively
upbeat Wednesday.
   ``I think that would be fair to say,'' chuckled spokesman Craig
Martin when asked if the company was heartened by the American order.
   So far this year, Boeing has announced orders for 102 jetliners
worth more than $8.2 billion. If that pace continued through 1989,
Boeing could set a record for order value for the fifth straight
year, breaking last year's mark of $29.7 billion. Boeing had orders
for 636 jets in 1988, an industry record.
   American ordered 25 Boeing 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft,
bringing American's total orders of those aircraft to 85 firm and 85
options.
   Martin said a mid-sized 757 sells for $46 million to $52 million,
depending on configuration, while the wide-body, extended-range
767-300ER is priced at $72 million to $78 million. At those prices,
the Boeing share of American's order would be worth between $1.87
billion and $2.08 billion.
   ``American's been a good customer _ they are a good customer,''
Martin said. ``To see them buying what we call the 757-767 family is
very encouraging. It's another indication that last year's surge in
757 sales will continue.''
   Last May 26, American ordered 50 757s, valued at about $2
billion, and took options on 50 more. The next day, United Airlines
ordered 30 of the planes, worth about $1.3 billion and optioned the
same number. Those orders were seen as a strong vote of confidence
for the 757, a fuel-efficient, quiet aircraft that had been a slow
seller since its introduction in the early 1980s.
   To date, Boeing has announced orders for 447 757s and 372 767s.
   GPA Jetprop, a partnership between GPA Group Ltd. of Shannon,
Ireland, and PWA Corp. of Calgary, Alberta, is a major lessor of
turboprop aircraft. Tom Appleton, de Havilland vice president for
marketing and sales, said its order is probably the largest ever for
a single model of turboprop airliner.
   ``This order transforms us to a central role in the turboprop
acquisition business,'' said Naill Greene, GPA Jetprop managing
director. ``We have gone from being a boutique to being a department
store.''
   The twin-engine Dash 8 Series 300 carries 50 to 56 passengers and
is used primarily on commuter routes.
   With GPA Jetprop's order, de Havilland has firm orders and
options for 86 of the aircraft, valued at more than $1 billion. For
the entire Dash 8 family, de Havilland now has orders and options
for 297 aircraft from 34 customers.
   GPA Jetprop earlier ordered nine Dash 8 Series 100 aircraft,
which carry 37 to 40 passengers, and took options on another five.
   Boeing has been hiring about 900 workers per month, with
employment expected to level off by mid-1989. Most of the new hires
will be at Boeing's Everett, Wash. widebody jet plant, where the
company is hustling to get deliveries of the 747-400 back on
schedule, company spokesman Paul Binder said.
   In 1988, Boeing's total employment rose by nearly 11,000, or 7.7
percent, to 153,000. The company is predicting job growth will be at
about 5 percent this year.
   ``It's slowing somewhat, but if you look at the level of economic
activity generated by Boeing right now, it's just extraordinary,''
said Douglas Pedersen, vice president and economist with Security
Pacific Bank Washington.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Block to Consolidated Gold Fields Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld a preliminary
injunction blocking Minorco SA's $5.7 billion hostile bid for
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC on antitrust grounds.
   A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also
said Wednesday Minorco's bid should be sent back to a lower court
for consideration of whether it violates U.S. securities laws.
   Minorco, which is largely controlled by two South African
corporations, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd., launched its bid for Gold Fields, a British
firm, last fall. Minorco, a Luxembourg corporation, already held
nearly 30 percent of Gold Fields' stock.
   Gold Fields has resisted the bid in Britain, and also filed an
antitrust action here.
   Minorco ``is the largest producer of gold in the non-communist
world, accounting for 20.3 percent of all gold production in the
western world,'' according to court papers.
   Gold Fields, meanwhile, has significant gold mining holdings in
South Africa, Australia and the United States, including 90 percent
of Newmont Gold, the largest gold producer in the country.
   Gold Fields ``accounts for 12 percent of the western world's gold
production, making it the second-largest gold producer in the
non-communist world,'' according to court papers.
   The company's Newmont subsidiary claimed that because it costs
less to mine and produce gold in South Africa than in America,
Minorco eventually would shut down U.S. operations if the takeover
was accomplished.
   ``Newmont's claim is that its ability to compete in the
marketplace will be reduced by anti-competitive influence, exercised
from inside its own boardroom'' if the Minorco bid succeeded, wrote
Circuit Judge Jon O. Newman in the 2nd Circuit's 25-page opinion.
   ``Newmont's threatened injury is precisely the type that the
antitrust laws were designed to protect against,'' the court said in
a 2-to-1 decision upholding an injunction imposed by U.S. District
Judge Michael Mukasey.
   Late last year, Mukasey issued a preliminary injunction
preventing Minorco, Anglo American and DeBeers from proceeding with
their tender offer until the antitrust issue was resolved in the
courts.
   Just before Mukasey's ruling, the Minorco bid was referred to
Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation of
possible anti-competitive consequences in the United Kingdom on such
strategic metals as titanium and zircon.
   British law prohibited further action on the takeover bid until
Feb. 2 when the commission found that the acquisition of Gold Fields
would not operate against the British public interest, the 2nd
Circuit opinion noted.
   With that ruling, Mukasey's injunction remained the only legal
obstacle to Minorco's offer. Minorco said it would nopt buy any new
shares unless the injunction was lifted or modified.
   In seeking the injunction, Gold Fields also claimed Minorco
violated the anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws, for
allegedly making and false and misleading statements about how much
control South African corporations and individuals have over it.
   Gold Fields claimed the Oppenheimer family of South Africa
indirectly controls Minorco, Anglo American and DeBeers and that the
stigma of South Africa's apartheid racial policy could make it
difficult to conduct business in some countries.
   The appeals court sent the case back to U.S. District Court for
further consideration of the fraud issue.
   In his decision, Mukasey claimed he lacked jurisdiction in
rejecting a Gold Fields claim that its U.S. investors entitled the
concern to sue in U.S. courts alleging violations of federal
securities law.
   About 2.5 percent of Gold Fields' outstanding shares are held by
U.S. citizens.
   But the 2nd Circuit panel, said ``the tender offer had sufficient
effects within the United States to warrant application of American
securities laws.''

   Alarmed by slumping prices from the Alar
scare, and dazzled by skyrocketing prices for chemical-free fruit,
many Washington apple growers are rushing into experiments with
organic farming.
   The interest is motivated more by economics _ primarily the 300
percent higher prices for organic apples _ than philosophy.
   ``I've had more calls in the past two or three weeks about
growing fruit organically than in the past three years,'' said
Brooke Peterson, the Washington State University tree fruit
extension agent for Yakima County.
   ``Organic growing in the past was a philosophical question,''
Peterson said. ``Today it's economic. There are higher prices for
it.''
   Washington produces half the nation's apples, and the 5,000
growers of the $312 million crop are unlikely to switch more than a
small percentage of the orchards to chemical-free growing.
   But rising consumer interest is creating a niche market many want
to tap.
   At meetings in the apple belt communities of Okanogan, Wenatchee
and Yakima this week, Pacific Fruit Growers-Packers, Inc. will
discuss organic techniques with hundreds of growers.
   ``I think that organic farming is essentially another (apple)
variety for us,'' said Greg McPherson, an assistant general manager
for Pacific Fruit and also a grower. ``There's definitely a market.''
   In the wake of the nationwide Alar scare, prices for organically
grown Washington apples have doubled to $48 per box. Prices for the
top grade of commercially grown Red Delicious apples, in contrast,
slumped another $1 this week to between $11 and $12 per 42-pound
box, barely above the break-even point and $2 to $3 less than before
the Alar scare.
   Diane Dempster, of Charlie's Produce in Seattle, which markets
organic fruit, said the gap between organic and standard apples is
not usually so great.
   ``Normally its 20 to 50 percent higher (for organic),'' she said.
``It's partly the Alar scare and a real increased demand.''
   Organic growing has received a lot of attention in recent weeks,
after a Natural Resources Defense Council report on pesticides in
children's food said eating apples treated with Alar increased
cancer risks in children.
   The industry disputes the findings and the federal government has
reassured consumers that apples are safe to eat.
   But a Louis Harris poll released this week found that 84.2
percent of those surveyed would choose organically grown food if
given a choice.
   Washington, Minnesota and Texas are the only states that have
organic certification programs, where farmers attest they have not
used synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.
   Only about 20 of the state's 5,000 apple growers are currently
certified as organic growers, according to Miles McEvoy of the state
Department of Agriculture.
   And a recent survey in Seattle found that only 1 percent of the
produce is organically grown, he said.
   To be certified in Washington, a grower must not have used
artificial chemicals for two years, he said.
   ``We're seeing a lot of apple growers interested,'' said McEvoy,
who runs the certification program.
   However, many growers contend it is impossible for the entire
apple-growing industry to switch to organic techniques.
   A major reason is that the codling moth would devastate virtually
the entire crop, infesting it with worms, Peterson said.
   But Washington growers are considering experimenting with a
variety of techniques.
   McPherson said he plans to hide 12 acres of organically-grown
apples in the middle of his orchards, surrounded by 48 acres of
chemically-treated apples.
   The pests normally stop at the first available tree to lay their
eggs, and he hopes that surrounding the vulnerable chemical-free
trees with a ring of sprayed trees will keep the moth away.
   There are other techniques being developed to handle the codling
moth without artificial chemicals, McEvoy said.
   But, he added, ``Apples are by far the hardest thing to grow
organically in the state.''

<HEAD>Report: First City Interested in MCorp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Houston bank holding company that was saved with
the help of federal regulators last year is now bidding to acquire
troubled MCorp, a newspaper reported today.
   The Dallas Morning News, quoting anonymous industry sources, said
First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc. chairman A. Robert Abbout
has approached federal regulators about bidding to acquire
Dallas-based MCorp.
   Abboud is working on a bid with the New York investment firm,
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., which helped raise the $500
million last April that allowed him take over Houston-based First
City. That deal included $1 billion in FDIC aid.
   Donaldson Lufkin officials could not be reached for comment
Wednesday. A First City spokesman told The News he could neither
confirm nor deny any interest in MCorp by Abboud.
   Combining First City, with $11 billion in assets, and MCorp, an
$18.8 billion institution, would raise a host of issues for the
government, particularly because of terms of the previous deal with
First City.
   That transaction gives the FDIC a stake in the company's ability
to collect on its bad loans. The FDIC will recoup some of its
investment based on the collections on soured loans made under the
previous First City management.
   A number of observers speculated that Abboud would consider a bid
for MCorp only if federal regulators first declared the company's
banks insolvent, avoiding the process he endured in taking over
First City.
   MCorp's most troubled banks include MBank Dallas and MBank
Houston, two of its largest susidiaries. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. reported that nearly a third of MCorp's banks had
exhausted their equity capital by the end of 1988, leaving them
virtually insolvent and opening the door for regulators to seize
assets.
   FDIC figures show that seven MBanks around Texas, including four
of the company's seven largest banks, reported negative equity _
exhausting shareholder funds _ at the end of 1988; representing
$11.8 billion of MCorp's $18.8 billion asset base.
   MCorp's chairman, Gene H. Bishop, has indicated he wants the
company to remain independent. He said last October that the company
could raise new capital to combine with FDIC aid, which analysts
have estimated would exceed $1 billion.
   The government said in November that it would consider
management's proposal while seeking other bids. Few suitors have
surfaced, partly because of complications that might arise in trying
to buy the company's banks without the cooperation of Bishop.
   MCorp's management also has retained about $400 million in cash
and other assets in the holding company. Bishop has indicated that
money may be available for helping the company's banks only as part
of a management-blessed reorganization.

<HEAD>Turner, Largest U.S. Builder, Wins Contract In Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' largest building contractor said
Thursday it isn't strongly interested in the Japanese market,
despite receiving one of the first private contracts to go to a U.S.
firm since an agreement to open Japan's construction market was
reached last May.
   The Turner Corp. signed a contract Thursday to team up with
Kumagai Gumi, one of Japan's biggest construction firms, in an 11.2
billion yen, the equivalent of about $85 million, construction
project in Tokyo for Japan's Shuwa Corp.
   Shuwa, one of the largest Japanese holders of American real
estate, owns 37 buildings in the United States, including Atlantic
Richfield Plaza in Los Angeles and the ABC Building in New York.
   The companies said Turner's portion of the joint venture would be
10 percent. Kumagai Gumi and Turner agreed last summer to cooperate
in construction projects in the two countries, and are jointly
involved in three projects in New York.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher welcomed Thursday's
contract as a ``fine example'' of private Japanese industry honoring
the spirit of last May's bilateral construction agreement, in which
Japan agreed to give U.S. companies access to a range of public
works projects.
   ``Most significant is that this private-sector project is outside
of that accord, but reflects most clearly our goal that American
companies be given the opportunity to introduce their expertise and
experience to all sectors of the Japanese market,'' Mosbacher said
in a statement.
   ``I want to make a small contribution to alleviating trade
friction,'' Shuwa President Shigeru Kobayashi told a news conference
after the signing. ``Instead of arguing and negotiating, the two
sides should promote more joint activities.''
   U.S. officials have charged that Japanese bidding practices and
other industry customs have blocked foreign entry into the Japanese
construction market. Japanese builders have denied that foreigners
are excluded, and say U.S. construction firms showed little interest
in Japan before the bilateral pact.
   ``I don't think the customs would prevent us,'' Turner Senior
Vice President Ralph Beck said after the contract signing. ``From
our perspective, the Japanese government and certainly Shuwa have
been providing the opportunities.''
   Beck said his company was more interested in increasing its
business in the United States and other countries through the Shuwa
venture than in increasing its access to the Japanese market.
   ``It doesn't make a lot of sense to beat your head against the
wall ... unless there's something that you can bring to the table
that's different than what the very capable industry can deliver
over here,'' he said.
   ``The world's a very big place ... and at the moment there are
more than enough opportunities in the world with better prospects
where we can bring something to the table.''
   Beck discounted what he described as ``paranoia'' in the United
States about an erosion of market share for U.S. contractors
resulting from the arrival of Japanese developers.
   ``The Japanese have brought building opportunities to the United
States which probably wouldn't have been there because there wasn't
anybody to invest in those projects,'' he said.
   Earlier this month, Tishman Realty and Construction Co. Inc.
announced it was forming a joint venture with Japan's Aoki Corp. to
build a luxury hotel in Osaka in what it said was the first private
construction agreement by a U.S. company following the bilateral
pact.

<HEAD>Annual Inflation Rate Rises to 7.8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's annual inflation rate jumped to an
unexpectedly high 7.8 percent in February, from 7.5 percent the
previous month, largely because of rising mortgage rates, the
government said Thursday.
   The higher mortgage rates stem from the government's drive to
push up interest rates as a way of fighting Britain's resurgent
inflation, which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher repeatedly has
said is her top economic priority.
   Excluding mortgage payments, the annual rate of inflation stood
at 5.7 percent, said Norman Fowler, secretary of the Department of
Employment.
   The annual rate was above the 7.7 percent rate the markets had
been expecting and fueled speculation that interest rates might be
hoisted even higher than their current 13-percent level.
   The pound held steady on the news. But share prices surprisingly
gained, as investors took the report in stride ahead of the long
Easter holiday weekend. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index, which had been down 6.4 points before the report, was down
2.7 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,045.9 afterward.
   ``The reaction was very muted,'' said one London trader. ``For
some people maybe, the figures weren't as scary as they thought.''
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson warned during his fiscal
budget speech earlier this month that he expected Britain's annual
inflation rate to peak at around 8 percent in the middle of year,
and that he expected the underlying rate, excluding mortgage rates,
to peak at 5.5 percent, a level it surpassed with the latest report.
   ``The chancellor already has some egg on his face,'' said Kevin
Gardiner, economist at the London investment firm Warburg
Securities. ``The market was a little bit disappointed by the
figures.''
   Lawson also said he expects the annual inflation rate to decline
to 5.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 1989 and to 4.5 percent by
the second quarter of 1990.
   ``Higher interest rates, which are affecting inflation in the
short term, will help bring the rate down in the longer term,''
Fowler, the employment secretary, said. ``Indeed, retail sales have
eased off and the recent figures show the underlying trend to be
broadly flat since autumn.''
   The commercial banks' base lending rate has risen to its current
13 percent from 7.5 percent last summer.
   The department said retail prices rose 0.7 percent in February
from January.
   It said its retail price index stood at 111.8 in February, 111.0
in January and 103.7 in February 1988. The index uses a 1987 base of
100.
   The department also blamed the higher prices on clothing, shoes
and household goods following January sales. Gasoline prices also
were up, it said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a moderate annual rate
of 2.4 percent in the final three months of last year, even better
than previously believed, the government said today.
   But the Commerce Department said the increase in the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was
accompanied by a pickup in inflation, reflecting higher food costs
and rising import prices.
   The 2.4 percent increase represented an upward revision from last
month, when the government estimated that the GNP had grown at an
annual rate of just 2 percent in the October-December quarter.
   The economy's momentum would have been an even stronger 3.5
percent except for the lingering effects of last summer's drought,
which subtracted more than 1 percentage point from growth.
   However, the strong growth, propelled by high consumer demand,
has economists and the Federal Reserve Board worried, given the
tight labor markets and high factory operating rates.
   The Fed last month embarked on a renewed drive to push interest
rates higher in an effort to dampen demand and cool off growing
inflationary pressures.
   But the Bush administration and some private economists have
complained that the Fed may be in danger of overdoing that effort
and end up pushing the country into a recession.
   Despite some alarming reports on inflation in January and
February that sent the stock market plunging, many analysts believe
that growth is slowing and the central bank does not need to do more
in its anti-inflation efforts.
   First word on the GNP performance for the first three months of
1989 will be released in April.
   An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at a sharp annual rate of
5.3 percent in the October-December quarter, up from a 4.7 percent
rate of increase in the third quarter.
   Since the index, known as the GNP deflator, has been rising at
annual rate of 3.8 percent or less for the past three years,
analysts said the uptick over the 5 percent mark indicated that
inflationary pressures have increased.
   In a look at how U.S. businesses performed, the Commerce
Department said corporate profits after taxes shot up 14.6 percent
in 1988, aided by a 2.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter. The
annual increase was the best performance for corporate profits since
a huge 22.4 percent jump in 1983, the year after the end of the
steep 1981-82 recession.
   The upward revision in the GNP for the fourth quarter made growth
for the entire year look slightly better. The government said the
GNP rose 3.9 percent in 1988, the best performance since a 6.8
percent increase in 1984. The yearly GNP increase had been put at
3.8 percent earlier.
   The 2.4 percent GNP growth in the fourth quarter followed a 2.5
percent rise in the July-September quarter.
   While it was the slowest advance since a 1.4 percent rise in the
fourth quarter of 1986, analysts said the pace was still too strong
because the overall rate was held back by the drought.
   The government has said it expects growth in the first quarter of
1989 will be boosted by 2.5 percentage points, reflecting a bounce
back from the drought.
   The upward revision for the fourth quarter reflected higher
government spending than previously estimated and a smaller decline
in business investment.
   The positive factors were offset somewhat by a larger trade
deficit. The government said the gap between imports and exports
shot up at an annual rate of $11.5 billion in the fourth quarter,
the sharpest widening of the trade imbalance since the third quarter
of 1986.
   While exports climbed by 6.5 percent, this improvement was
swamped by a 13.5 percent rise in imports. Many analysts are fearful
that the improvement in the trade deficit, which contributed almost
half of total growth last year in the economy, has stalled out.
   These analysts predict that the combination of a worsening trade
picture and the credit-tightening by the Fed will translate into
much more sluggish growth this year.
   That possibility has the administration worried because President
Bush is counting on economic growth remaining robust as a way of
lowering the budget deficit without resorting to a tax increase.
   The administration's economic forecast, upon which it based its
assumption that the budget deficit would decline below $100 billion
next year, called for the GNP to expand at a healthy clip of 3.2
percent.
   However, private economists, even those who think the country can
escape without a recession, are much more pessimistic.
   The latest consensus forecast from Blue Chip Economic Indicators,
a financial newsletter which surveys 50 top economists each month,
puts growth for 1989 at 2.7 percent, based on a belief that consumer
spending, business investment and U.S. exports will all show less
strength than in 1988.
   Many analysts believe there is plenty of evidence that the
slowdown is already occurring in weaker consumer spending and slower
business investment.
   On Wednesday, the government reported that orders to U.S.
factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods declined for a second
straight month in February, the first back-to-back monthly declines
in three years.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the decline in factory orders provided ``solid
evidence that the economy is slowing down.''
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass., said he believed the slowdown would not snowball into an
outright recession even though he said the worse-than-expected
inflation reports so far this year did increase the possibility of a
slump.

<HEAD>Battle For Control Of Sun Electric Escalates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partnership seeking to acquire Sun
Electric Corp. is suing the company, claiming management is unfairly
hindering its efforts to wage a proxy fight for control of the firm.
   SOQ Partners, a Delaware limited partnership, announced Wednesday
that it had filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Wilmington,
Del., charging that Sun Electric was illegally soliciting proxies
for its April 11 annual meeting.
   The move comes one day after the Crystal Lake, Ill.-based auto
equipment manufacturer announced it was seeking a rescuer or buyer
to save it from the takeover bid by SOQ, its largest shareholder.
   Sun Electric said it has asked its investment banking firm,
Salomon Brothers, to explore ``finding a strategic partner for Sun,
a merger or an orderly sale of part or all of the company.''
   At the same time, the company said its board had rejected SOQ's
demand that Sun Electric be put up for immediate auction or face a
proxy fight.
   SOQ, led by Connecticut-based investor John C. Page, owns about
12 percent of Sun Electric.
   In its lawsuit, SOQ also charged that Sun Electric's board had
adopted a ``secret bylaw'' aimed at preventing SOQ from waging a
proxy fight. The lawsuit seeks an order invalidating proxies
obtained by Sun Electric's management.
   SOQ said its lawsuit was a response to a U.S. District Court
lawsuit filed in Delaware by Sun Electric, charging SOQ with giving
false information to the Securities and Exchange Commission
regarding its motives for buying Sun Electric stock.
   The general partners of SOQ Partners are CJP Management Inc., a
corporation controlled by Page; the Weinress Group, a corporation
controlled by Stephen D. Weinress, and Campbell Lutyens Inc., a
corporation of which Richard D. Lutyens is president.
   In a separate lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court, SOQ is
seeking an order invalidating the alleged ``secret bylaw.''
   Sun Electric spokeswoman Sharon Evey said in a telephone
interview that the firm's lawyers ``feel the allegations are
groundless.''
   Sun Electric's stock price surged $2.12{ to $17.50 Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange in reaction to the latest development in
the takeover battle.
   Sun Electric manufactures diagnostic, test and service equipment
for automobile mechanics and manufacturers. The company also markets
service-station management systems for the retail petroleum industry.
   Sun Electric reported a net loss of $4.2 million on sales of $190
million in 1988.
   Of SOQ's general partners, Page controls CJP Management Inc.,
which is involved in the distribution of automotive and hydraulic
products; Weinress controls the Weinress Group Inc. and is the
marketing director of L.H. Friend, Weinress Frankson Inc., a Los
Angeles-based brokerage and investment-advisory firm; Lutyens is
president of Campbell Lutyens Inc., the U.S. arm of Campbell Lutyens
&amp; Co. Ltd., a London-based merchant banking and investment-advisory
firm.

   Centel Corp. said Thursday it agreed to sell its
cable TV operations in Illinois and central Florida, and news of
deals involving four other cable units could come in a few days.
   The Chicago-based company did not disclose the sale prices of the
Centel Cable Television Co. properties but said it expects the gross
proceeds from all six sales to total more than $1.4 billion.
   Centel said it would sell its central Florida cable operation,
which has 97,000 subscribers, to American Television and
Communications Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and sell its Illinois cable
business, with 122,000 subscribers, to Jones Intercable Inc. of
Englewood, Colo.
   American Television, which is an 82-percent owned subsidiary of
Time Inc., is the nation's second largest cable operator serving
more than 4 million television homes in 32 states.
   The deal will give Jones Intercable and its affiliates systems
with about 1.3 million subscribers.
   The sales, which Centel expects to complete in the third quarter,
leave the company with cable operations in southeastern Florida,
Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio.
   Centel announced in late November that it would sell its cable
television company, the nation's 22nd largest, so it could
concentrate on its telecommunications businesses, which include
local telephone service in nine states and a cellular telephone
subsidiary that operates in 13 states.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Board Rejects Tyson's $63.50-A-Share Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge in Delaware has ruled that an offer
from Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale to buy out the Holly Farms Corp.
of Memphis, Tenn., is better than a rival offer from ConAgra of
Omaha, Neb.
   But Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett's 29-page decision Wednesday
left it up to Holly Farms stockholders to choose between the Tyson
and ConAgra offers. Hartnett said shareholders would probably reject
the proposed merger agreement from ConAgra.
   Today, Holly Farms announced that its board had decided to reject
Tyson's offer of $63.50 per share and to recommend that stockholders
not tender their shares pursuant to that offer. The board met
Wednesday.
   Last week, Tyson increased its offer to acquire Holly Farms stock
from $60 a share to $63.50 a share in a deal worth about $1.18
billion. ConAgra has offered a stock swap deal worth between $1.09
billion and $1.17 billion. But Don Tyson, chairman and chief
executive officer of Tyson, says his company's offer is worth much
more.
   Hartnett's ruling came in a suit by Tyson asking that the judge
stop a scheduled April 14 vote by Holly Farms shareholders on the
merger. The judge allowed the vote to proceed.
   Should shareholders approve the merger, Hartnett said he wouldn't
allow the agreement to go through until he makes a decision on a
so-called ``crown jewel lockup'' provision worked into the merger.
   The provision would give ConAgra an option to buy prime assets
from Holly Farms if the merger fell through. The provision is
intended to make an acquisition by Tyson diffcult.
   Hartnett said the provision was tainted and probably
unenforceable.
   The Holly Farms board said in a news release today that by
continuuing to condition its tender offer on the invalidity of the
lockup agreement, ``Tyson had failed to provide the board with the
necessary assurance that Tyson would complete an acquisition of
Holly Farms on a timely basis, if at all.
   ``Unless and until Tyson removes from its tender offer the Asset
Option condition,'' a Holly Farms spokesman said in the release.
``Holly Farms' stockholders can have no assurance that Tyson's
$63.50 price represents deliverable value. For this reason,
ConAgra's merger agreement still represents, in the board's view,
the best alternative for our stockholders.''
   Tyson Foods has hired a New York firm to help it sway Holly Farms
stockholders in its direction. But the board of Holly Farms, which
has said it prefers the offer from ConAgra, has also hired a New
York firm in an effort to keep its stockholders in the ConAgra camp.
   The management of Holly Farms needs two-thirds of its
shareholders of record to vote April 14 to approved its merger with
ConAgra.

   Officials of two of the three unions at Eastern
Airlines _ including the striking Machinists _ are among the members
of a committee representing unsecured creditors of the crippled
carrier.
   Harold Jones, the federal trustee supervising administration of
Eastern's bankruptcy reorganization appointed the 15-member
committee Wednesday to represent the unsecured creditors, and
included officials of the machinists and the Air Line Pilots
Association.
   The Transport Workers Union, which represents flight attendants
at Eastern, was not included. However, the creditors' panel does
include a representative of non-union employees, most of whom were
laid off a few days after the Machinists' walkout began and are
demanding back pay.
   In Tallahassee, Fla., a federal appeals court today was scheduled
to hear an Eastern request to force pilots to cross Machinists'
picket lines and go back to work.
   The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months of
wrangling with management over a contract. The pilots' support for
the walkout virtually grounded Eastern and forced it to file for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws on March 9.
   The Eastern pilots are owed more than $500 million in back pay
and other claims, said Ron Cole, a spokesman in Miami for the pilots
union.
   Flight attendants also honored the Machinists' picket lines.
   The creditors' committee has the right to review any
reorganization plan proposed by Eastern and can propose its own plan
to the bankruptcy judge.
   Jones told a gathering of around 400 creditor representatives,
financial analysts and reporters the role of the creditors' panel is
``far more expansive'' than his.
   Eastern says it has $5.9 billion in assets and $4.5 billion in
liabilities. Unsecured creditors, such as ticketholders and travel
agents, are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy
reorganization because they have no collateral, or security, from
the debtor in case of default.
   The airline's secured creditors, mainly bondholders, met with
Eastern President Phil Bakes on Tuesday.
   Eastern's liabilities include $1.69 billion in long-term debt,
$736 million in capital lease obligations and $165 million in unused
tickets issued to passengers, Harvey Miller, one of Eastern's
bankruptcy attorneys, told the creditors' meeting.
   ``The objective of Chapter 11 is to rebuild Eastern,'' said
Miller, a partner in the law firm Weil, Gotschal Manges. ``It is
Eastern's plan to resuscitate the airline and build back its flight
schedule.''
   The embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots
in newspapers. Only about 200 of the 3,600 or so pilots at Eastern
have crossed Machinist picket lines to fly.
   Eastern is operating only a fraction of the flights in its normal
schedule, except for nearly normal service on its Northeast air
shuttle and to Latin America.
   Miller said 167 planes out of Eastern's fleet of 254 aircraft are
currently inactive, parked on airport runways in Miami, Atlanta,
Orlando, Fla. and New York.
   In addition to the International Association of Machinists and
the ALPA, the other members of the unsecured creditors' committee
are as follows. Where available, the amount owed them by Eastern is
included:
   Aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie, $95.94 million; General
Electric Co., $75.47 million; Citicorp; United States Trust Co. of
New York, $58.74 million; Boeing Co., $53.98 million; United
Technologies Credit Corp., $22.30 million; IBJ Schroder Bank and
Trust Co., $19.56 million; American National Bank &amp; Trust Co.,
$12.76 million; Rolls-Royce Credit Corp., $5.89 million; Marriott
Corp., $1.05 million; AT&amp;T Communications, $800,876; Rohr Aero
Services; and Mary Grace Shore, representing non-union employees of
Eastern.
   Ms. Shore is an elected representative of a non-union group
called PEACE, or Positive Employee Action Committee at Eastern,
which union officials allege is sponsored by Eastern management.
   ``I think it's quite insulting that every employee group at
Eastern is on the creditors' committee except the flight
attendants,'' said Mary Jane Barry, president of a Transport Workers
Union local representing Eastern flight attendants. ``It's really a
slap in the face.''
   She asserted that Ms. Shore is really a representative of Eastern
management rather than the airline's employees.
   ``That group (PEACE) is nothing but a union-busting group of
people,'' Ms. Barry said today in a telephone interview from Miami.

   White House and congressional budget
negotiators reported today that their talks have been ``cordial and
constructive'' but that they were still some distance from reaching
a spending compromise.
   ``What is most important is the clear understanding of every
member of the negotiating group of the need for an effective budget
agreement,'' the bargainers said in a letter to President Bush and
House and Senate leaders.
   The closed-door sessions, aimed at producing a fiscal 1990
spending plan, were put on hold Wednesday because of Congress'
Easter recess and are scheduled to resume April 3.
   ``Our meetings have been both cordial and constructive,'' the
letter said. ``A number of budget options have been discussed. We
intend to continue to negotiate on the basis of these and other
options in an effort to reach a compromise.''
   ``It is our hope that we will achieve a compromise on the broad
outlines of a resolution... that can serve as the basis for
congressional action within the next few weeks,'' it said.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said that ``because we haven't reached agreement today
doesn't mean we don't have a good chance of reaching one down the
road.''
   Earlier this month, Sasser and his House counterpart, Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., had promised to report to Democratic leaders
today on the progress of the talks.
   The two Democrats, however, warned that unless an agreement is
reached with the White House in early April, they will write their
own budget and attempt to move it through Congress.
   ``I think we're either going to have an agreement by the middle
of April, or know we can't have an agreement,'' Sasser said.
   Sasser said his panel will begin writing its own spending plan if
the talks fail to produce a deal within the first two weeks of April.
   Panetta was even more demanding, saying that for his panel to
meet its deadlines, he believes the talks will have to produce a
package within the first week in April.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, Congress is
supposed to complete its budget resolution by April 15. Later
legislation is needed to provide the actual spending for programs.
   So far, the main players in the talks have been ranking Democrats
and Republicans on both chambers' budget committees and White House
budget director Richard Darman.
   Administration officials have met intermittently with
congressional budget writers ever since President Bush introduced
his $1.16 trillion spending plan on Feb. 9.
   In its effort to reach the Gramm-Rudman requirement of a deficit
of no more than $100 billion, Bush's proposal contained $14 billion
in new revenues.
   The White House refuses to characterize them as new taxes; Bush
pledged during his presidential campaign to oppose tax hikes.
   ``The limitation we're struggling with is the political
limitation on revenues, and that continues to haunt these
discussions,'' Panetta said.
   Democrats have complained that Bush's budget relies too heavily
on domestic cuts for its savings, and have proposed an alternative
that would reach half the deficit reduction goal with additional
revenue, one-fourth through military cuts and one-fourth with
domestic reductions.
   But Sasser said that so far in the talks, Darman has merely
``restated the Bush budget, perhaps with minor differences.''

   Wheat futures opened slightly higher this morning
on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly in response to a diminshed
chance for rain this weekend in the central Plains states where
winter wheat is grown.
   Soybean and oat futures were mostly lower in early trading while
corn was nearly unchanged.
   The early gains in the wheat market follow a steep sell-off on
Wednesday prompted by forecasts for rain early next week in Kansas
and other key winter-wheat areas.
   But this morning's forecasts indicated the chances for rain this
weekend in the central Plains were fading, encouraging some traders
to buy wheat futures.
   Soybean futures opened slightly lower on profit-taking after
Wednesday's rally, then turned mixed. Corn was nearly unchanged.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.27\ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to \ cent lower with May at $2.79 a bushel; oats were unchanged to {
cent lower with May at $2.07} a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower
to 1 cent higher with May at $7.92 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher with April at
78.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .32 cent
higher with March at 79.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent
lower to .17 cent higher with April at 42.60 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher with May at 38
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Wednesday while pork futures
finished mixed.

<HEAD>De Beers Raises Prices 15.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The De Beers diamond cartel of South Africa, citing
strong demand, says it is increasing prices for rough gemstones an
average 15.5 percent.
   The price increase for a broad range of uncut diamonds, announced
Tuesday, is effective next week. It follows a 13.5 percent increase
last May and a 10 percent increase in September 1987.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which is based in Johannesburg,
controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market through its
London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization.
   It does not disclose what the prices are.
   The cartel only sets prices for rough diamonds, which it doesn't
disclose, and operates a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in
South Africa and Australia to dealers and cutters in the world's
major diamond cutting centers, Antwerp, Bombay, New York and Tel
Aviv.
   It holds about 10 ``sights'' _ or sales _ for international
diamond dealers a year, with the next one scheduled for next week.
   ``We are responding to prevailing conditions in the market. It
was market-led,'' spokesman Richard Dickson said Thursday about the
price increase.
   Demand for rough diamonds of two carats and less is especially
strong, he said.
   ``The industry is anticipating another good year in 1989 from
retail diamond and jewelry sales,'' Dickson said.
   The generally weaker dollar has helped sales because diamonds are
priced in dollars and holders of Japanese yen and European
currencies get more for their money.
   In addition, sales should improve in Japan after April 1 when a
15 percent tax in Britain on luxury items costing about $300 or more
is replaced with a flat 3 percent sales tax on all items, Dickson
said.
   The markets in Israel and India are particularly strong, with
good advances also in New York and Belgium, he said.
   ``We are bringing rough prices up in line with those prices of
polished diamonds that are prevailing within the diamond cutting
centers,'' he said.
   The organization had record sales of $4.2 billion in 1988, up 37
percent from $3.08 billion in 1987, the previous record.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
primarily in drilling. Between 10 percent and 20 percent are gems.

<HEAD>Attica To Iran-Contra To Wall Street: Arthur Liman's Career</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur L. Liman, a gangly disheveled man with a
Noo Yawk accent, probably is best known for picking apart Oliver
North on national television as captive nation watched.
   ``Oliver North, isn't it a fact...,'' Liman prefaced each
question to the deposed Marine lieutenant colonel during the
congressional Iran-Contra hearings that made Liman's baggy face and
half-moon ears a household image.
   His simple, direct, persistent style pierced the veil around the
man President Reagan called a ``national hero'' and earned Liman, an
outsider in Washington, the admiration of fellow Democrats and
Republicans alike, as well as bags of hate mail.
   ``It was like Shakespeare,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman, the New
Hampshire Republican who was vice chairman of the Senate committee
Liman served as general counsel two years ago. ``The guy is good.''
   The guy is back in his native New York, returned to the highest
(and highest-paid) echelons of the city's legal community and to the
almost notoriety-free existence he prefers after a summer when every
Washington cabbie knew him by name.
   Liman's career has taken him from investigating the Attica prison
riots, to defending the likes of John Zaccaro and Robert Vesco, to
boardroom negotiating at CBS, to grilling Oliver North.
   At 56, Liman declines specialties, though he is considered a
brilliant trial attorney and the city's most prominent securities
fraud lawyer in a decade permeated with Wall Street crime.
   Liman most recently was lead defense attorney in a major stock
manipulation case against GAF Corp. He also represents Michael
Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s financier who expects to
be indicted for fraud and racketeering.
   ``I am not a specialist in criminal securities fraud cases,''
Liman said in an interview during the exhausting 12-day
deliberations in the GAF case, which ended March 22 in a second
mistrial. ``I've always believed that a trial lawyer should be able
to try any kind of case. I have avoided narrow specialization.''
   A sampling of Liman's clients over the last few years
demonstrates the versatility his peers respect.
   On the corporate side, he represented Pennzoil Co. against Texaco
Inc. in 1985 and even delivered testimony on the witness stand that
helped send Texaco into bankruptcy court. Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc. are clients _ the two, not coincidentally, just
announced a massive merger.
   In 1986, Liman negotiated a handshake between clients Laurence
Tisch and William Paley that led to the ouster of CBS Inc.'s Chief
Executive Officer Thomas Wyman.
   In the public domain, Liman supervised Richard Nixon's disbarment
and probed allegations of wrongdoing in New York City's medical
examiner's office.
   His clients aren't all saints. In addition to Milken and insider
trader Dennis Levine, Liman has represented Zaccaro, the real estate
mogul and husband of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro, and Vesco, the fugitive businessman.
   ``He's negotiating this case now and he could be negotitating a
takeover deal tomorrow,'' said Robert Fiske, a New York lawyer and
former U.S. attorney who has known Liman 20 years. ``He's extremely
versatile. He handles an enormous variety of cases.''
   Born in Queens, Liman joined the New York law firm of Paul Weiss
Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison in 1957 after finishing first in his
class at Yale Law School. But he cut his teeth on white-collar crime
during a 2{-year stay at the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
under Robert Morgenthau starting in 1961.
   ``I had never worked on a securities case because there really
weren't any,'' Liman said. ``We were breaking new ground.''
   He recalled himself as the office ``garbage pail,'' taking small
cases colleagues shunned. Liman once won a conviction of a bartender
for diluting liquor but got just a $1 fine _ the Irish judge had a
bartender father.
   In 1971, Morgenthau appointed Liman, who had since returned to
Paul Weiss, as special prosecutor to investigate the Attica prison
riots in upstate New York. It was the first probe inside a prison,
and Liman's team interviewed every inmate. His report was nominated
for a National Book Award.
   The Attica hearings were televised, but Liman said they formed an
almost polar contrast to the turbulent and politically charged
Iran-Contra proceedings, during which Liman received at least two
serious threats for his perceived attacks on North.
   ``I knew the hearings were going to be televised but it never
occurred to me they would become such an object of media
attention,'' he said. ``Nor did I really anticipate there was going
to be this wholesale stripping away of my privacy.
   ``All of a sudden we were receiving 100,000 hate letters and a
few fan letters. ... Whenever somebody is very public in this
country it brings out the crazies.''
   With North now on trial in Washington, Liman recalls the hearings
as an exercise in unearthing evidence, not bringing anyone to
justice. The philosophy of the mission, he said, quoting the late
Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, was that ``sunlight is the
best disinfectant in a democracy.''
   ``There are some events in American history where it's most
important for the American people to understand how it happened and
why it happened,'' Liman said.
   ``When I went down to Washington on the job there was a rumor a
day on what happened. What people forget is these hearings dispelled
so much of that. If we weren't able to find out everything that
happened we were able to find out much and let the American people
judge.
   ``I told the committee when I took the job that I could never
determine for them what the real truth was _ because too many
documents had been shredded and we'd have to rely on credibility.''
   Liman talks to judges and juries and Oliver Norths in the same
paced, deferential, just-folks manner. Facing the bench, hands in
his pockets, he exposes drooping shirttails behind a tapered suit.
   ``I think juries don't go for the dramatic,'' he said. ``I think
they see the things and decide for themselves.''
   Liman also is notoriously absentmindend. He has appeared in court
in mismatched suits. One oft-repeated story has Liman asking his
secretary to call a client. When she reported the man had died of a
heart attack, Liman replied, ``Just have him call me when he gets
in.''
   Said Rudman: ``What is deceptive is Arthur Liman speaks like the
guy next door. But what is driving the verbiage is a computer in his
head. Even Oliver North came away with great respect for Arthur
Liman. He was fair. He never took a cheap shot at anybody in those
hearings.
   ``I don't know what life holds for Arthur. Maybe someday there'll
be a Democratic president. If there is, I hope Arthur Liman ends up
in government.''

   Sales of cars and light trucks made by the
nation's Big Three automakers rose 2.3 percent in mid-March compared
with a year earlier, driven by strong demand for trucks, the
companies reported Thursday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they
sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 36,321 during
the March 11-20 period this year, compared with 35,505 during the
same time last year.
   Truck sales soared 7.5 percent during the period, offsetting a
0.8 percent decline in car sales.
   During mid-March of 1988, vehicle sales fell off a torrid pace
set earlier in the year. During mid-March this year, automakers
extended some buyer incentives and boosted others to reduce vehicles
stockpiling on dealer lots.
   The companies have said that results in March and April, usually
a good time for the industry, will be a test for them and the deals
they offer the consumers.
   So far this year, car and truck sales for the Big Three averaged
32,066 vehicles a day, down 7.4 percent from the 34,617 daily
average during the period last year.
   Car sales were down 10.7 percent and light truck sales were 1.5
percent lower as the first quarter of the year drew nearer an end.
   Ford reported car sales rose 6.1 percent in mid-March this year,
to an average daily rate of 7,185 cars compared with 6,773 last
year. For the first 20 days of the month, Ford's car sales were down
9.3 percent and for the year, they were off 2.1 percent from the
same periods last year.
   Truck sales by Ford ran 10.6 percent ahead of last year's rate in
mid-March and 1.8 percent behind the year-to-date pace.
   GM said cars sold at a daily rate of 11,545 during mid-March this
year, a 0.2 percent increase over the daily rate of 11,522 during
the same time in 1988. So far in the month, GM's cars sold at a rate
6.7 percent lower than last year's rate for the same period, and for
the year, car sales were 12.7 percent lower.
   Light truck sales by GM ran 5.5 percent ahead of last year's pace
during mid-March and 4.3 percent behind the rate since the first of
the year.
   Chrysler said cars sold at a daily rate of 3,228 during mid-March
this year, down 16.2 percent from the 3,850 car-a-day rate during
the same time last year. Sales for the first two 10-day periods of
March this year were 26.6 percent behind last year's rate, and for
the year, car sales were 20.7 percent lower than in 1988.
   In mid-March, Chrysler's light trucks sold at a rate 6.7 percent
higher than last year's rate for the same period. Year-to-date truck
sales were 3.9 percent ahead of the daily sales rate during the same
time last year.

   Stocks closed higher Thursday, although trading was
thin before a four-day Easter holiday weekend.
   Prices initially fell in anticipation of a possibly negative

<HEAD>U.S. Court Ruling Threatens to Sink Minorco Offer; Gold Fields Stock
Down</HEAD>

   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC shares plummeted
Thursday on speculation that a U.S. court ruling would block Minorco
SA's hostile takeover attempt for the British mining giant for at
least a year.
   The attempted buyout, valued at about $5.5 billion, is Britain's
biggest ever.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York late Wednesday
upheld a lower court's preliminary injunction barring the South
African-controlled Minorco from buying more than 30 percent of
shares in Gold Fields, which has both U.S. interests and American
shareholders.
   Minorco, which is controlled by the gold and diamond mining
giants Anglo American Corp. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.,
already owns 29.6 percent of its target.
   The appeals court said the proposed takeover likely would violate
U.S. antitrust laws. The court also ruled that the Minorco bid
should go back to a lower court for consideration of whether it
violates U.S. securities laws.
   The court noted that Minorco, through its various holdings, ``is
the largest producer of gold in the non-communist world, accounting
for 20.3 percent of all gold production in the western world,''
while Gold Fields, a British firm, is the free world's
second-largest gold concern.
   Luxembourg-based Minorco now can either appeal the latest ruling
to the U.S. Supreme Court or take the case back to the lower court
for a trial on the antitrust issues.
   But analysts said they saw little chance the U.S. litigation
could be resolved within the time limit allowed for the bid under
British takeover rules.
   Minorco said it was disappointed with the ruling and said it was
``reviewing the court's opinion with its advisers and studying the
options available to it.''
   Gold Fields shares dropped the equivalent of $3.15 a share to
close at $21.50 in active trading on London's Stock Exchange.
Minorco rose 29 cents to $12.90 a share.
   Gold Fields Chairman Rudolph Agnew called the ruling good news
but said ``the implications for the outcome of the bid aren't yet
clear.''
   Under British takeover regulations, Minorco can't extend its bid
beyond April 26 and must control more than 50 percent of Gold
Fields' outstanding shares by then.
   Minorco then would have until May 17 to satisfy or waive all
outstanding conditions on the bid, which offered one new Minorco
share plus $35.26 in cash for every two Gold Fields shares. One of
these conditions is resolution of the U.S. litigation, which could
continue for weeks, months or years.
   ``What has happened is very bad news for people who were hoping
for more money out of the Gold Fields issue,'' said Christopher
Spreckley, an analyst at CL-Alexanders Laing and Cruickshank. ``Time
is just not on Minorco's side. Unless legal miracles start happening
(in the United States), I think this bid is bordering on dead.''
   Minorco's only incentive to sweeten its offer would be if it
thought it could persuade Consolidated Gold Fields to accept a
friendly buyout and drop the U.S. litigation, said Jeff Summers, an
analyst with the London investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd.
   But, ``It's very unlikely that Minorco would raise the bid,''
Summers said. ``Mr. Rudolph Agnew and his board do seem to be
determined to stay independent. Given some of the vitriolic remarks
which have passed between the two camps...I will be very surprised
if Gold Fields would be willing to consider an offer from Minorco.''
   There was some speculation Minorco might persuade the Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers to extend the time period within which it must
complete the bid until the U.S. court case is resolved.
   Minorco also could clear up the litigation and make a new offer
for Gold Fields sometime after February, when the British takeover
regulations would permit it to launch another bid, the analysts said.
   ``Anglo-American and Minorco have spent many years planning their
attempt on Gold Fields and I again would be surprised if they walked
away from it purely because of a U.S. court ruling,'' Summers said.
``I think Minorco might be willing to take a very long-term view.''

<TEXT>
   Corporations' after-tax profits shot up 14.6
percent in 1988, the best showing in five years, the government said
Thursday in another report cited as evidence of last year's strong
economic picture.
   The Commerce Department said after-tax profits rose to $163.8
billion last year following a 10.1 percent gain in 1987. Last year's
advance was the biggest since a 22.4 percent post-recession jump in
1983.
   After-tax profits were up 2.8 percent in the final three months
of 1988, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $173.9 billion,
after advancing 3.9 percent in the third quarter.
   The report said increases in manufacturing profits were strongest
in the chemical industry. Profits also increased in the trade,
transportation and public utilities sectors.
   Analysts said that with the economy likely to slow this year and
production and materials costs rising, the corporate profit outlook
for 1989 is not as bright as it was last year.
   ``At this stage in the business expansion, profits are going to
lose momentum,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. ``1988
was a terrific year for the economy and for corporate profits.
Profits did extremely well because of good sales and low costs. But
we're past the best times in profits.''
   He projected that after-tax profits this year would increase by 5
percent to 6 percent and could then decline in 1990.
   Among the details in the profits report:
   _Before-tax profits rose 1.8 percent last quarter, to a
seasonally adjusted annual level of $319.5 billion, after rising 2.6
percent in the third quarter.
   _Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and
inventories, rose 3 percent last quarter, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $339.9 billion, after rising 1.1 percent in the third
quarter.
   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, increased 3.2 percent last
quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $409.2 billion,
after rising just 0.8 percent in the third quarter.
   _Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.2 percent in the fourth
quarter, to an annual rate of $108 billion, following a 2.5 percent
rise in the third quarter.

<HEAD>Carmaker Settles Dispute With 7 States, Will Have Safety Messages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Suzuki Motor Corp. said today it has
agreed to put safety warnings in advertising for its
four-wheel-drive Samurai to settle a dispute with the attorneys
general of seven states.
   The company said the messages _ which warn against abrupt
maneuvers in the so-called ``sport utility vehicles'' _ are to be
included in all ads and promotional material.
   The dispute with the top law enforcement officials of California,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Texas and Washington
stems from a controversy that erupted in June over a consumer
group's allegation the sporty cars were likely to roll over.
   The attorneys general had accused the company of violating laws
against false and deceptive advertising.
   Suzuki has heatedly disputed the allegations by Consumers Union,
the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration in September denied a petition to
order a safety recall.
   The agreement requires the Japanese carmaker to include in its
ads the following statement: ``This vehicle handles differently from
ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns
and abrupt maneuvers. Always wear your seat belt. For specific
details, please read your owner's manual.''
   The company also agreed to reimburse the states $200,000 for
legal costs.
   American Suzuki, the U.S. arm of the Japanese automaker, noted
the company hadn't acknowledged any safety problems with the cars.
   ``For Suzuki and Samurai owners, this agreement with the
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false
allegations about the Samurai,'' N. Douglas Mazza, the company's
vice president and general manager, said in a news release from
American Suzuki's Brea, Calif. offices.
   Consumers Union tests found that because of its short wheelbase
and high center of gravity, the Samurai is dangerously prone to roll
over under what the consumer group maintained are normal driving
conditions.
   Suzuki officials have said the car, classified for import as a
``sport utility vehicle,'' handles no differently than other
four-wheel-drive cars made in the United States and elsewhere.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade in response to weaker cash markets,
forecasts for weekend rains in the Midwest and perceptions of
increasing supplies.
   Corn and oat futures also closed lower while wheat futures
advanced slightly.
   Market participation was thinner than usual, with some traders
getting an early start on the Easter weekend. The markets are closed
Friday.
   Some selling in the soybean market was incited by forecasts for
rain in parts of the Midwest late in the weekend or early next week,
which could reduce lingering dryness from last summer's drought.
   Perceptions that newly harvested Brazilian soybeans are about to
come onto the world market added to the selling pressure.
   Wheat futures traded lower for most of the session amid forecasts
for diminished chances of rain in the central Plains but finished
with slight gains as traders evened up their positions ahead of the
long weekend.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.28{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to
3 cents lower with May at $2.77\ a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3\

   A second mistrial in a key stock manipulation
case and the perjury conviction of a young bond trading assistant
highlight problems the government has when it takes Wall Street
crime cases to court, defense lawyers said Thursday.
   The white-collar corruption probes that started with Dennis
Levine in 1986, led to Ivan Boesky and targeted Michael Milken
yielded their first criminal conviction Wednesday with the guilty
verdict against 26-year-old Lisa Jones.
   Less than 30 minutes later in the same courthouse, a federal
judge declared another mistrial in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation
case after the jury said it was deadlocked after 12 days of
deliberations.
   The outcome of the two trials left defense lawyers unimpressed
with the government's trumpeted efforts to bring Wall Street
criminal charges to court.
   In the Jones case, attorneys said, the government may have
overzealously pursued a defendant who was by all accounts a minor
figure in the alleged scandal. And with GAF, the government was
unable to convince a jury of its case.
   ``In a day where you have all this Wall Street bashing, a jury
was unable to decide after two weeks, and that means to me they
didn't have what evidence goes with a criminal case _ harm,
malevolence, evil intent,'' securities fraud lawyer Stanley S. Arkin
said.
   Until now, cases derived from the insider trading scandals of the
mid-1980s were settled through government plea bargains or as civil
claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   At least half a dozen criminal trials are scheduled for later
this year. They will test the confessions of Boesky, the
now-imprisoned arbitrager, and other financial figures who have
cooperated with the government in exchange for leniency.
   Prosecutors based much of the GAF case, which ended in a January
mistrial after the government unintentionally withheld evidence, on
testimony by Los Angeles broker and admitted felon Boyd L.
Jefferies. He said GAF asked him to illegally manipulate the price
of Union Carbide Corp. stock.
   Many attorneys expected the trial to turn simply on whether
jurors believed Jefferies. But during deliberations, the panel asked
for charts and graphs and re-heard testimony involving the
often-confusing intricacies of stock trading.
   The GAF case also was seen as problematic because none of the
accused made any money from the alleged deals.
   ``What it proves is the jury element is an important distinction
between civil and criminal cases,'' said Paul Fischer, a former SEC
lawyer now in private practice. ``You just never know about a jury _
whether they'll understand the case, what they'll focus on in making
a decision.''
   Said Arkin: ``I think whenever they try cases where nobody got
hurt and they are hypertechnical cases, (prosecutors) ought to
rethink it.''
   Under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, the government
brought charges in more than 50 securities fraud cases starting in
1983 and made fraud prosecution a priority, increasing the
complement of investigators to about 20. A handful of earlier,
insider trading-related cases did go to trial, including the 1986
conviction of former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans,
but GAF was the headline case spun off from Boesky.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said after the verdict the government
intends to bring the case again and attributed the second mistrial
to the vagaries of juries.
   Some defense lawyers agreed.
   ``I don't think that means either the government can or can't win
an insider trading case. It means that in this case nobody won so
far,'' said Michael Feldberg, a prosecutor under Giuliani from
1981-84.
   The GAF jury, which was sequestered March 10, issued a statement
through U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe saying it would not
comment on deliberations.
   In the Lisa Jones trial, defense lawyers harshly criticized the
government's tactics, accusing prosecutors of badgering her,
misleading the jury and raising red herrings about stock deals that
Jones may not have understood.
   Jones was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for
lying to a federal grand jury in 1987 during an investigation of
possibly illegal stock purchases by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for
now-defunct Princeton-Newport Securities LP.
   Jones worked for Bruce Lee Newberg, a former Drexel trader who
faces a June trial on racketeering charges along with five
Princeton-Newport partners. Newberg reported directly to Milken, who
is expected to be indicted for fraud and racketeering.
   Lawyers portrayed the prosecution of Jones, a one-time runaway
who rose to a $117,000-a-year position at Drexel, as overzealous.
They claim she was treated harshly on the stand _ she broke down
repeatedly _ as a message to potential future witnesses.

<HEAD>Steve Jobs's Next Inc. Switching Tactics With Businessland Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Jobs' Next Inc., in an abrupt switch
in marketing tactics, next week will announce plans to sell its
``scholar's workstation'' through the nation's top retailer of
desktop computers to business, industry sources said Thursday.
   Next's deal with Businessland Inc., which has 112 outlets
nationwide, would give Jobs' Palo Alto-based company greater
visibility, speed up development of software for its workstations
and deal a blow to rival Sun Microsystems Inc., analysts said.
   Jobs, who called a news conference for March 30 to make ``a major
business announcement,'' said last fall Next would initially sell
its workstations exclusively to educators and students at a
discounted price of $6,500 and would not venture immediately into
the business market.
   ``That was always a smokescreen,'' said Bruce Lupatkin, analyst
for Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. in San Francisco. ``Anybody who is awake
would realize you couldn't build a big business in workstations and
avoid selling to the corporate and technical market.''
   The worldwide market for general purpose and technical
workstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range from about
$8,000 to $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion and is
growing rapidly. The retail price of the Next Computer System,
according to industry sources, will range from $10,000 to $12,000.
   Next's workstation, a sleek, black magnesium-boxed computer,
which features a magneto-optical disk drive that can hold about
200,000 typewritten pages of information, is Jobs' first product
since his ouster as chairman of Apple Computer Inc. in 1985.
   Sun Microsystems, headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., is the
leading maker of Unix workstations for engineers and technical users
and has been negotiating with Businessland and other resellers.
   ``Sun is out in the cold as far as Businessland is concerned,''
Lupatkin said. ``This is a step in the right direction for Next, but
I don't think it means they have arrived and will replace the
leaders.''
   Businessland, which declined comment on the deal, also is
expected to announce it will carry new versions of IBM's RT PC
technical workstations that can use Next's software.
   ``Every workstation manufacturer is jockeying for market
position,'' Jobs said in a letter announcing the news conference.
``Next believes that several non-technical factors will play key
roles in determining who wins.''
   Jobs said Next has been shipping its computers for almost three
months, and noted that several customers and key software developers
would join in the announcement next week.
   Jobs declined to confirm the deal with Businessland or name the
software firms, but sources said he would announce development of
spreadsheets, word processors and database programs by Lotus
Development Corp., Ashton-Tate Corp. and Apple's Claris Corp.
   Initially, Next is expected to market its workstations through
Businessland for scientific and engineering jobs because it already
has some software for those uses. Software for business will take
longer to develop.
   The switch from a focus on the education market to the business
and technical market, however, may backfire on Next, said Stewart
Alsop, publisher of P.C. Letter.
   ``You can't run around for three years saying one thing and then
change it overnight,'' he said. ``And educators, who until now have
been Next's top priority, are very sensitive to how they rank in the
eyes of their suppliers.''
   Some analysts wonder whether Next, which has about 250 employees,
is ready to meet the demands of selling the computer in the retail
market.
   Alsop said selling retail would be ``fundamentally a mistake''
for Next, noting that its computer was not designed for business use
and is not compatible with existing standard products.
   He added, though, that the computer industry is in a state of
confusion, particularly in the market for machines such as Next's
that use versions of AT&amp;T's Unix operating system.
   ``Next has an opportunity to walk into the Unix market and set
the standard,'' Alsop said.

<TEXT>
   The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this
community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an
insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing
phenomenon.
   Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary
telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby
airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring
him to the De Soto store.
   Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in
close touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed by
other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of
time in the field.
   Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas
metropolitan area, ``It's not like `uh-oh, someone's coming,'
because they're always out.''
   By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations
throughout the company.
   Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer
David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the
gospel according to Sam, as he is called.
   To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing; ``Rule No.1 is
the customer is always right. Rule No.2 says just in case the
customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.''
   If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are
because that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.
   He shuns the limlight that his company's success has shed on him
and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.
   He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.
   He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart ``associates'' that
hospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or via
high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.
   Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company
effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union
organizing effort in the late 1960s.
   One of the most sensitive subjects for him is the fortune he's
amassed. A close associate says Sam would ``probably give anything''
not to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's
wealthiest people. The magazine has estimated that his immediate
family's stake in Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.
   ``Sam Walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his
bank account,'' says Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.
   Samuel Moore Walton turns 71 on March 29. He was born in
Kingfisher, Okla. and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.
   He graduated the University of Missouri with an economics degree
in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee in Des
Moines, Iowa. After serving three years in the Army, he went to
Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually
becoming the company's biggest franchisee.
   The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his
brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in
1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S.
retail trade.
   Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.
Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had are
involved with the company in various capacities.
   Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as
ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with
leukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office since
handing over most responsiblities to David Glass. Sam is still
chairman of the board.
   Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourish
without Sam. The answer is an emphatic yes because ``We have great
people,'' he says. The Walton family will always be involved, he
adds.
   Commenting on the future, Glass says: ``We'll be judged on what
we produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won't
matter.''

<HEAD>Jetta A Stable and Stalwart Car</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 Volkswagen Jetta Carat offers admirable German handling
in a small package and at a competitive price.
   Here is a stable, stalwart car that takes road curves with little
sway. Here is a vehicle that zips along well and takes both city and
highway driving in stride. Here is a compact auto with a spacious
trunk and comfortable seats where the driver doesn't have to feel as
if he or she is sitting low inside the car.
   VW first brought the Jetta to the United States in 1980, and
although sales have fallen from their 1986 peak of 93,000, the Jetta
continues to be VW's best seller in the United States. Last year's
sales remained about flat with 1987's 65,000 level, said company
spokesman Jay Amestoy.
   The 1986 peak came after the Jetta was redesigned with new
engine, suspension and chassis systems.
   Thankfully for today's buyers, the 1989 VW Jetta retains the fine
characteristics of its predecessors even if it hasn't made the
change outside to the fancier, more aerodynamic body styling of some
of the competitors (Honda Accord, Mazda 626).
   Today's Jetta line includes a base, two-door model which starts
at $9,690, the upscale Carat and the performance GLI 16-valve
version.
   The test Jetta Carat (pronounced with the accent on the last
syllable, not like the vegetable) was wonderfully stable at high
speeds. The 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine was mated with a
five-speed automatic transmission to produce 105 horsepower at 5,400
rpm.
   The car cruised the highway well and seemed just as at home in
city-driving maneuvers. The two front seats had nifty height
adjusters that helped position me so I could easily have a clear
view over the front of the car _ a position I can't always find in
other autos.
   Lots of equipment came standard including rear headrests, power
windows, mirrors and antenna, AM-FM stereo with cassette player and
six speakers and a computer that figured fuel economy, average
driving speed, etc.
   The only option on the test car was the $395 manual sunroof and
that really wasn't necessary since the car also had
factory-installed air conditioning.
   However, VW is offering in 1989 for the first time antilock
brakes ($995), and while the test auto didn't have them, they might
be worth a good look, given their remarkable ability to help
maintain vehicle control.
   The Jetta's trunk is one of the largest in its class, with 16.6
cubic feet of storage space. The sturdy backing under the Carat's
carpet make the trunk one of the easiest to keep neat. There's no
sliding or bunching of the carpet.
   The Jetta is built for five passengers, but it could be pretty
uncomfortable with three adults in the back seat. The seats are
sturdy, for sure, but there could be a tight squeeze and whoever has
to sit in the middle will be sitting high up on a hard spot. Legroom
also could be cramped.
   My only other note was the difficulty I had at times in putting
the car in the right gear. The floor console for the automatic
transmission had raised white letters for the gears, but sometimes
it was tough to tell if I was in neutral or drive, drive or second.
That problem disappeared at night when the letters would light up as
the car was put in gear.
   Jetta buyers are young, with median age of 30 and median income
of $43,700. Nearly half are male, and 53 percent are married. The
vast majority have at least some college education and 61 percent
are in upper white collar jobs, Amestoy said. Main purchase reasons
include value for the money, ease of handling and reliability and
durability, the company said.
   Consumer Reports magazine says 1983-86 model Jettas ranked better
than average in owner reports of trouble.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $2.8 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 461 money market mutual
funds rose $2.8 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise to $299.4 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.3 billion increase in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   It was the eleventh straight weekly all-time high for money
market mutual fund assets reported by the trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 228 general purpose funds rose $1.3 billion to $97.42
billion, assets of 94 broker-dealer funds increased $1.08 billion to
$129.05 billion, and assets of 139 institutional funds rose $449.1
million to $72.97 billion.
   ``As the yields paid by money market funds kept increasing their
advantage over the yields of other financial instruments available
to individual investors, assets of money market funds continued to
climb,'' said Dr. Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist
at the Institute.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.95 percent from 8.85 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.78 percent from 8.68 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 31
days, down from 32 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.53 percent as of Wednesday from 6.50 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, fell to 5.14 percent from 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.05
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.96 the
previous week. Yields were 9.25 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 9.13
percent; 9.19 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 9.10 percent; and 9.13
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 9.09 percent.

   Stock prices fell Thursday, wiping out some early
gains as talk on Wall Street intensified about the possibility of a
recession in the not-too-distant future.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.17 points to
2,243.04, extending its loss for the week to 49.10 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
584 up, 814 down and 567 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 153.75 million
shares, against 146.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 181.25 million shares.
   Activity was subdued on the eve of a long holiday weekend. The
markets will be closed for Good Friday.
   The drop in stock prices came despite a slight decline in
interest rates in the government bond market.
   Analysts said it appeared that investors were worrying
increasingly about prospects for corporate earnings later this year
and in 1990 if the economy slows, as many analysts expect it to.
   ''Stagflation _ rising prices and sluggish growth _ will
characterize much of the year,'' analysts at Merrill Lynch said in a
commentary issued Thursday. ``But that environment could give way to
an actual recession by the end of the year, as the economy reacts to
monetary tightening.''
   Digital Equipment rose } to 97[ and International Business
Machines added ] to 109|. Both stocks came under severe selling
pressure in recent sessions as the Street's earnings expectations
for the companies were scaled back.
   An IBM official said investors had overreacted to a company
statement last week that its earnings for the first quarter would
fall short of analysts' estimates. He said the company's
expectations for demand for all of 1989 haven't changed.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down 1 at
44; Philip Morris, down 2 at 114~; McDonald's, down 1[ at 48];
DuPont, down 1[ at 100, and Eastman Kodak, down { at 44}.
   Universal Foods climbed 2 to 36. High Voltage Engineering raised
its offer for the company's stock from $35 a share to $38 a share.
   Chelsea Industries rose 1| to 27]. The company said it received a
$28.75-a-share buyout proposal from an investor group led by its
chairman.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $12.13 billion, or 0.43
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .77 to 162.64.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.75 to 332.79, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 1.51 at 288.98.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.37 to 400.94. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 324.87, down 1.01.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices spurted Thursday, driven by
a rally in the gasoline pits inspired by speculation the
Environmental Protection Agency will endorse new restrictions
affecting refining in the Northeast.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for
unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent to 58.02 cents a gallon after
posting a 0.21-cent increase on Wednesday.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
heating oil for April delivery went up 0.52 cent to 56.52 cents a
gallon.
   Meanwhile, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, finished with a gain of 11 cents
at $20.15 a barrel.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker and analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said rising gasoline prices lifted the
entire energy market.
   Gasoline buying was triggered by news reports that the EPA was
likely to approve pending applications seeking to lessen
pollution-causing emissions from gasoline sold in Northeastern
states to cut smog in the region, he said.
   Energy market analysts say the restrictions will make the
refining process more costly and complicated and could lead to
temporary shortages as refiners in the Northeast make alterations to
accomodate tighter rules.
   Speculation about how the proposed rules will affect gasoline
supplies is expected to dominate the gasoline pits in the near
future.
   ``Next week's going to be very critical for the gasoline
market,'' Lebow said.``There's potential for very explosive movement
on the up side.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Domestic Trading</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher in uneventful domestic
trading Thursday after putting in a mixed performance overseas ahead
of the long Easter weekend.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New York
said gold was bid at $392.00 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down
$1.40 from Wednesday's late bid.
   Traders said the dollar held in a narrow range as they squared
their positions before the holiday weekend.
   ``It was fairly quiet,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president
at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ``There was no determination to
push the dollar in either direction.''
   While there will be limited domestic dollar trading on Friday,
the European currency markets are closed until Tuesday.
   ``With Europe gone for the weekend, we expect very little
activity,'' said Jeff Mondschein, a vice president at Continental
Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Mondschein noted that there was only ``minimal'' interest in the
government's revision of the fourth-quarter gross national product.
The Commerce Department said the economy expanded at a moderate 2.4
percent annual rate in 1988, up from an initial estimate of 2
percent.
   The GNP report gave the dollar a slight boost earlier in Europe,
but traders there noted that activity was subdued.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.52 Japanese yen to a closing 130.88
yen. Later in London, it fell further to 130.75 yen. But in New
York, the dollar rose to 131.25 yen, from 131.06 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7205 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7225 late Wednesday. In
New York, it cost $1.7215 to buy one pound, less expensive than
Wednesday's $1.7270.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.8715 West German marks, up from 1.8660;
1.6264 Swiss francs, up from 1.6180; 6.3333 French francs, up from
6.3220; 1,376.88 Italian lire, up from 1,373.00, and 1.1901 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1878.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.8720 West German marks, up from 1.8693; 1.6260 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6225; 6.3315 French francs, down from 6.3345;
2.1025 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1115; 1,370.12 Italian lire, down
from 1,373.10, and 1.1894 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1897.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $392.80 a troy
ounce, down from $394.40 on Wednesday.
   In London, gold was quoted at a late bid price of $394.75 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a late bid
of $395.00, from $393.65 late Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
fell $2.30 to close at a bid $396.14 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery finished at $6.008 a troy ounce, down from
Wednesday's $6.058. In London, the metal was trading at a bid price
of $6.08 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $6.07.

<HEAD>Platinum, Silver Futures Plunge In Thin Markets As Dollar Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum and silver futures prices fell sharply Thursday as the
dollar gained strength but analysts said the metal tumble resulted
mainly from thin market conditions as traders got an early start on
the long Easter weekend.
   Thin trading conditions also were mentioned by traders as a
reason for a rally in the orange juice futures market.
   On other markets, sugar futures continued a slide begun on
Wednesday, soybeans were lower while grains were mixed; energy
futures advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   The nation's commodity and financial markets will be closed on
Friday.
   Platinum futures settled $9.20 to $9.50 lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at
$537.40 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $1.60 to $2.20
lower with April at $393.40 a troy ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to
6.6 cents lower with May at $6.058 a troy ounce.
   The precious metals remained within their well-worn trading
ranges and analysts said the sharp downward moves in platinum and
silver were not linked to any significant change in market
fundamentals.
   But with many overseas markets closed, the number of market
participants was unusually small, which typically increases
volatility.
   Precious-metal values generally move in the opposite direction
from the dollar. So when the dollar began gaining strength against
other currencies, ``that put downside pressure on the precious
metals and because of the thin market conditions, it drove the
metals lower than they normally would have gone under this
scenario,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals-market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Most frozen concentrated orange juice futures leaped the
permitted 5-cents-a-pound limit for daily trading on the New York
Cotton Exchange amid unconfirmed rumors of possible price increases
by Florida processors. The contract for May delivery, which has no
limit, soared 6 cents to $1.5595 a pound.
   But analysts said the rally was exaggerated by thin market
conditions.
   ``We're looking at a forecast for Brazilian output to increase
sharply next year and I just don't see any real supply concerns,''
said analyst Judy Ganes of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Sugar futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange on continued speculative selling following Wednesday's
statement by the Soviet Union that it had completed its sugar-buying
program for 1989.
   Sugar settled .37 cent to .52 cent lower with May at 11.11 cents
a pound.
   Soybean futures prices fell on the Chicago Board of Trade in
response to weaker cash markets, forecasts for weekend rains in the
Midwest and perceptions of increasing supplies.
   Some of the selling was prompted by forecasts for rain in parts
of the Midwest late in the weekend or early next week, which could
reduce lingering dryness from last summer's drought.
   Perceptions that newly harvested Brazilian soybeans are about to
reach the market added to the selling pressure.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with May at $4.28\ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with May at $2.77} a
bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3\ cents lower with May at $2.05\ a
bushel; soybeans were 6{ cents to 9{ cents lower with May at $7.84{
a bushel.
   Energy futures advanced moderately on the New York Merc. The May
crude-oil contract surged to $20.24 a barrel, where it encountered
strong resistance and retreated into the close.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 12 cents
higher with May at $20.15 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent to .52
cent higher with April at 56.52 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .20 cent to .99 cent higher with April at 58.02 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed in pre-weekend
position-evening on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .37 cent higher with April
at 78.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .33
cent higher with April at 81.02 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with April at 42.70 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .23 cent lower to .60 cent higher with May at
38.15 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Attorneys General: Suzuki Agrees to Include Warning in Samurai Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Suzuki Motor Corp. has agreed to pay
$200,000 to seven states and to include in future advertisements a
warning that its Samurai sport vehicle may roll over if turned too
sharply.
   The agreement announced Thursday settles lawsuits filed by New
York, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Texas and
Washington accusing the car manufacturer _ the U.S. arm of Japanese
automaker Suzuki _ of false and deceptive advertising. It was
effective Tuesday.
   American Suzuki, based in Brea, Calif., entered the agreement
without admitting any guilt or safety problems. The $200,000 is to
cover the states' costs in preparing the cases.
   The states began investigating the Samurai's safety last June
after Consumer Reports magazine gave the popular, four-wheel-drive
sport utility vehicle its first ``not acceptable'' rating in 10
years.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said the $8,500
Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and its center of
gravity is too high to be safe. It was the first car of 349 tested
in the last decade to roll over during a routine accident-avoidance
test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid an obstacle in the
road, the group reported.
   ``This agreement strongly affirms that the Samurai is a safe
vehicle and strongly supports the federal government decision that
there is no reason to investigate the safety of the Samurai,'' N.
Douglas Mazza, American Suzuki's vice president, said in a statement.
   Consumers Union, of Mount Vernon, had asked the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to recall the more than 150,000
Japanese-built Samurais sold in this country since its introduction
in November 1985.
   The agency denied the recall petition in September, saying the
Samurai had a rollover rate ``within the range of most other light
utility vehicles.'' It also said most rollovers were influenced by
``drinking, low ambient light and lack or driver familiarity (with)
either the vehicle or the road.''
   New York Attorney general Robert Abrams said Thursday that the
states took action because ``the federal government has, once again,
failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.''
   Samurai print ads now must include the following statement:
``This vehicle handles differently from ordinary passenger cars.
Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers which
can cause vehicles of this type to roll over. Always wear your
seatbelt. For specific details, please read your owner's manual.''
   A shorter version of the statement is required for television and
radio ads, Abrams said.
   Abrams said his investigation indicated previous Suzuki ads
``deceived the public by promoting the Samurai as a safe, fun
passenger vehicle while knowing it...can present considerable
dangers to young, inexperienced, first-time purchasers who were
Suzuki's target buyers.''
   Suzuki contended its advertising did not violate state laws but
decided to agree to a settlement to avoid possible legal action by
the states.
   ``For Suzuki and Samurai owners, this agreement with the
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false
allegations about the Samurai,'' Mazza said.

   It's a sobering time for the North Sea
oil industry.
   Although business is good again after a deep slump, experts say
relatively weak oil prices and the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster last
July have forced underwater drillers to change the way they do
business.
   Once concerned about producing oil quickly, the industry now is
more worried about restraining costs, and that has meant many lost
jobs, experts said.
   The rig disaster, a fire that killed 167 men, halted a
considerable amount of production _ 300,000 barrels a day for about
six months _ and increased safety concerns.
   The industry has attracted many competitors with its 22 percent
success rate in finding oil despite the technological problems
associated with underwater drilling.
   The rivalry has squeezed profits and encouraged takeovers,
leaving a smaller number of companies. The most notable takeover was
British Petroleum Co. PLC's $4.4 billion acquisition of Britoil PLC
early last year.
   Adding to concerns is an awareness that the oil won't last
forever and Norway's sector of the North Sea is expected to surpass
British production in a few years.
   Some companies have moved to protect themselves by getting more
heavily into gas exploration and production, selling their expertise
abroad and broadening into defense and other non-oil areas.
   ``It's a different business we're in,'' said Ian Wood, head of
John Wood Group PLC, a Scottish oil-services company.
   ``The super-boom is gone. The '86-'87 downturn was a watershed.
The emphasis now is on cost.''
   Britain is the non-communist world's sixth largest oil producer
after Saudi Arabia, the United States, Mexico, Iran and Iraq,
figures compiled by the Royal Bank of Scotland show.
   Thirty-six fields produced about 2.41 million barrels a day last
year, down 7.5 percent from the 1985 peak of 2.59 million barrels a
day.
   Production is expected to decline to 2.22 million barrels a day
this year, 2 million by 1995, and expire in 30 to 50 years. North
Sea oil was first produced in significant amounts in 1976.
   It is Scotland's largest single industry with 54,000 workers,
down 18 percent from 1985 but 6 percent higher than during the
slump, the bank said.
   ``Currently, I think business is very, very good,'' said Derek
Marnoch, chief executive of the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce.
   Oil prices plummeted from $30 a barrel to $10 a barrel in early
1986, and have recovered to about $19.
   ``The oil price shock came as quite a devastating blow in the
industry,'' said James Walker, an economist at the Royal Bank of
Scotland. ``Since then companies have moved on to a new expectation
about oil prices and the potential of the North Sea and have acted
accordingly.''
   Recently, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
curbed production to bolster prices, and independent producing
countries have announced they are trimming exports.
   Britain belongs neither to OPEC nor the independent group, but
North Sea oil production is vulnerable to OPEC's erratic behavior.
   The North Sea oil industry has cut costs by reducing manpower,
upgrading technology and undertaking smaller projects, Walker said.
   Still, it's more expensive to produce oil in the poor North Sea
conditions, $3 to $15 a barrel, vs. less than $1 a barrel in the
Middle East, Walker said.
   Despite declining production and weak prices, experts said oil
exploration remains healthy.
   Industry enthusiasm was reflected in good demand for exploration
leases in the government's recent sale.
   Last year was a record year for drilling, with 21 new fields
begun, said Angus Nicolson, a Scottish Development Agency official.
   ``Ultimately we are looking at finite resources,'' said Ian
Henderson, deputy managing director of Shell U.K. Exploration and
Production. ``The challenge now is to find the smaller and smaller
amounts and produce them cleverly.''
   Even after cutting costs, however, it's difficult to make a
profit, the experts said. ``There are the usual complaints that the
margins are thin,'' Marnoch said.
   Indeed, Henderson conceded that his company's net income has
eroded, but he declined to elaborate.
   The Piper Alpha rig, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp., was
owned by Occidental and other oil companies, and Shell was not
directly involved in the disaster. But upgrading safety has
increased its costs, Henderson said.
   A public inquiry into the disaster might result in
recommendations for costly safety measures. For example, the
government already has asked the industry to comment on the
possibility of requiring all operators to install emergency shutdown
valves.

   The bond market rose modestly Thursday, extending
the gradual recovery of the previous two sessions in quiet
pre-holiday trading.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3-16 point, or $1.88
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its
price, fell to 9.21 percent from 9.23 percent late Wednesday.
   Trading trailed off by midafternoon as dealers went home early
for a three-day Easter holiday. There is no bond trading on Good
Friday.
   In contrast to earlier in the week, there was no economic news to
move the market. Traders shrugged off as old news the government's
report that the economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
last three months of 1988.
   ``It was very thin today. There's nothing that anybody can grab
on here,'' said Thomas Estes, a trader with Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 1-32 point, intermediate issues were up 1-32 point
to 1-16 point and long-term maturities rose 3-32 point to 3-16
point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.67 to 1,113.98.
   In corporate trading, industrials were up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.34
to 295.70.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose \ point to 89{. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.84 percent from 7.87 percent late Wednesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 9.35
percent as the discount remained at 9.02 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 9.55 percent as the discount rose 1 basis
point to 9.00 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.67 percent
as the discount fell 1 basis point to 8.91 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 9~ percent, down from 10{ percent late Wednesday,
when it had been pushed up by technical factors.

<HEAD>European Automakers Girding for Crowded Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Japanese players revving up for entry into the
crowded field of $20,000 to $40,000 luxury cars in the United States
are on a collision course with European makers for a share of the
growing upscale segment.
   As a result, auto industry analysts predict some foreign
competitors could get severely bruised in of one the most lucrative
markets in the world.
   ``Neutral country attacks Germany and Japan,'' says an
advertising campaign recently started by Saab-Scania of America,
Inc., fighting to keep the Swedish automaker's spot in the United
States.
   Peugeot Motors of America Inc., with its roots in France, also is
cranking up a new campaign and has offered dealers incentives they
can pass to customers.
   Britain's Sterling Motor Cars meanwhile is restructuring its
entire U.S. marketing, service and parts plan to slow a sales skid.
   ``What we are seeing happen is that a lot of the European
manufacturers who have taken their niche for granted have realized
all of a sudden that it's not a guarantee,'' said auto-industry
analyst Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America in San Francisco.
``The prevailing attitude has been is that there is a Saab buyer, a
Mercedes buyer who will always be there.''
   That's been changing.
   U.S. sales for 14 European-made cars last year were 16.4 percent
behind 1987 levels, led by Audi's 44.7 percent tumble and Sterling's
sales dip of 37.9 percent. During the same time, sales of all
imported cars dropped 4 percent.
   European cars made up 5.5 percent of the entire U.S. car market
in 1988, down from 6.8 percent the year before.
   The fiercest competition promises to be among the expensive,
relatively low-volume European imports, including Saab, Peugeot,
Sterling, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Audi. Some analysts wonder
how those companies will fare in the scrap over the market pie.
   ``We have dealers saying this is the most competitive time
they've ever faced,'' said Tony Kirton, director of marketing for
Audi of America Inc. ``They often say that, but this time I believe
them.''
   Besides watching each other, European makers are scrutinizing the
latest wave in the Japanese invasion of the United States car market
_ Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti luxury car divisions.
   Each of the Japanese automakers plan to begin selling two models
this fall. The Lexus cars are expected to cost between $20,000 and
$35,000. Infiniti's prices will range from $25,000 to around $40,000.
   That wedges them into the market now divvied up by Volvo, Saab,
Peugeot, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Sterling and Audi. The Japanese makers
have said their target with Infiniti and Lexus principally is the
European competition, not the few U.S. entries from General Motors
Corp.'s Cadillac and Ford's Lincoln-Mercury divisions.
   ``I think they will get off to a pretty good start,'' said auto
analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York.
``The names of the companies are known. These guys have deep pockets
and a lot of patience.
   ``I think we can count on the fact that it will be a pretty good
product,'' he said.
   Saab's U.S. president, Bob Sinclair, disagrees.
   ``The Japanese are moving upscale and that's a very significant
move,'' he said. ``They're reliable but they're bland and look
basically alike.''
   Japan's move into the luxury import segment, challenging the
Europeans, began in March 1986 with Honda's Acura division. In 1988,
sales for the division rose 16.5 percent over the year before. By
volume, Acura sold more cars last year than did all European imports
except Volkswagen. Division spokesman Mike Spencer said Honda is
counting on Acura's sales to increase 15 percent to 20 percent this
model year.
   Automakers and analysts predict the luxury-performance segment of
the car market will grow during the next year, partly reflecting the
financial success of the baby-boom generation. Nonetheless, there's
still concern whether it will grow enough for everybody to survive.
   ``We're really fortunate we've had a 3{-year head start in that
segment,'' Spencer said.
   Acura will remain strong in the market, Garretty said, because of
established reputation. It's priced lower than most of the Europeans
and what's expected for Lexus and Infiniti. Acura's prices are more
in line with Saab's.
   ``They (Saab) do have reason to be concerned,'' said analyst
Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. of New
York. ``Saab is more of a cult following. People either love it or
hate it,'' she added. ``Saab is one of those companies which is
stuck in no man's land.''
   Healy agreed, and wondered about the future of Saab and Peugeot
in the United States. Peugeot has a much smaller U.S. presence than
Saab _ selling about two-thirds as many cars last year _ but its
European automobile operations are stronger, Healy said.
   So, Saab has decided to take off the gloves in its advertising in
an attempt to make its name better known in the United States.
   ``I think it's the old story about the farmer with the mule.
First you have to get its attention,'' Sinclair said. ``We thought
we should throw bombs and hand grenades to get their attention.''

   The government claimed Thursday that defense
lawyers said most jurors in the GAF Corp. criminal stock
manipulation case favored conviction when a judge declared a
mistrial because the panel was deadlocked.
   Defense attorneys immediately denied the claim attributed to them.
   The GAF case drew wide attention as the first criminal trial
arising from the confessions of imprisoned insider trader Ivan
Boesky. It was the second mistrial in the case and suggested
prosecutors cannot easily win convictions, but the government asked
Thursday for a third trial starting next month.
   It wasn't clear when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe would
set a new trial date for GAF and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin.
   ``As we understand it, most jurors felt beyond a reasonable doubt
that Mr. Sherwin is guilty and we're confident that they all will
next time,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, who heads the
securities and commodities fraud division.
   ``We actually were told about the split by defense lawyers,'' he
said. ``We were told that is what they learned.''
   But attorneys for Sherwin and GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based specialty
chemicals maker, said they had not spoken to jurors or indicated to
prosectuors which way the jury was leaning.
   ``No one from the defense made that statement to my knowledge
because there would be no basis to make that statement,'' said
Stephen Kaufman, an attorney for Sherwin.
   ``It's speculation. It's surmise without any proof,'' he said.
``There is no public information and the jury issued a communication
that they don't want to discuss the matter.''
   The jury said in a statement through Lowe they would not comment
on their more than 90 hours of deliberations that followed the
six-week trial. Jurors reached by telephone Thursday stuck to their
pledge.
   The panel reported last Saturday it was deadlocked 11-1 but did
not indicate whether the majority favored acquittal or conviction.
On Wednesday it reported a three way split _ some to acquit, some to
convict and others undecided.
   The judge then asked whether further deliberations would be
fruitful. Seven said no, five said yes and Lowe decreed the mistrial.
   ``The original deadlock note of 11 to 1 did not indicate what the
sentiments of the jury were,'' said Alan Levine, an attorney for
Sherwin. ``They only thing that can be said for the next note is
that it appears there was some kind of a shift.''
   ``But I think it's still not possible to tell what the sentiments
were Saturday night or (Wednesday) afternoon,'' he said.
   After the 11-1 note, the defense asked Lowe to declare a mistrial
several times as the tiring deliberations progressed.
   Lowe also declared a mistrial in January after ruling that the
government unintentionally withheld evidence. At that time, jurors
on the first panel said they could not have convicted GAF based on
the testimony.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin were charged last year with
allegedly trying to boost the stock price of Union Carbide Corp. in
1986 shortly before selling a large block of shares. They also were
charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.
   The purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize GAF's profits
from the planned sale of a large block of Union Carbide stock after
a failed takeover of the much larger chemical concern.
   The second mistrial was perceived as a setback in the
government's efforts to stage criminal trials in a Wall Street fraud
investigation that began with the insider trading scandals of the
mid-1980s.
   ``It's always disappointing when all 12 jurors don't accept the
government's case,'' Baird said. ``As long as we're confident in the
strength of our cases and confident that most jurors saw the case as
the government saw it, we'll try it again.''

<HEAD>Takeover Target Polaroid Protects Itself Through ESOP, Other Maneuvers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rewrites throughout to update with Shamrock selling Polaroid
stake in buyback.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you think corporate takeover battles are like
the Wild West, you might say Polaroid Corp. circled the wagons to
repel a $3.2 billion assault from investor Roy E. Disney.
   After Disney's Shamrock Holdings Inc. announced its bid eight
months ago, Polaroid methodically placed stock in friendly hands in
preparation for its annual meeting, using an employee stock
ownership plan, a share repurchase program and the sale of shares to
a sympathetic third party.
   Polaroid's moves were upheld by Delaware state courts and this
past week Shamrock said it was selling its 4.96 million Polaroid
shares back to the instant photography pioneer under the repurchase
plan. However, the Disney group would not say whether it was
abandoning its bid.
   ``It seems to have worked,'' said Eugene Glazer, an analyst who
follows Polaroid for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., of the strategy
designed to garner enough support to prevent Shamrock from unseating
Polaroid's board at the annual meeting.
   An estimated one-third of Polaroid's voting stock is held by
company allies, making it difficult for Shamrock to win the majority
it would need in a shareholder proxy fight.
   Moreover, the Polaroid strategy likely ensures that Shamrock
would fail through a tender offer to shareholders. Under state law
in Delaware _ where Polaroid is incorporated _ a suitor would have
to acquire 85 percent of Polaroid's stock or wait three years to
complete the merger.
   Polaroid's strategy has intrigued observers.
   ``Other companies that are incorporated in Delaware are going to
look extremely carefully at the actions Polaroid has taken as a
guideline for how to defend yourself against an unfriendly
acquirer,'' Glazer said.
   In upholding Polaroid's moves, the Delaware Court of Chancery
disagreed with Shamrock's contention that the employee stock
ownership plan, $1.1 billion stock buyback and sale of $300 million
in preferred shares to Corporate Partners LP were intended primarily
as takeover defenses.
   Despite that ruling, the fact remains that these steps constitute
a powerful shield against a hostile bid.
   Most employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, aren't created as
takeover defenses, but as a way for companies to raise cash. They
also are useful when a company is acquired by employees; Avis Inc.
was taken private through an ESOP in 1987.
   Many companies like them. The National Center for Employee
Ownership, a research organiation, estimates there are 9,500 ESOPs
covering nearly 10 million workers in the United States.
   Lawyer Todd Lang, who has drafted ESOPs, says stock ownership
``tends to keep your employees interested in the profitability and
productivity of the company and interested in the stock price.''
   But when J.C. Penney Co. Inc. created a $700 million ESOP last
summer and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. upped its employees' stake to 20
percent from 14 percent earlier this year, analysts said these were
defensive steps.
   Analysts made the same judgment when Polaroid unveiled its ESOP
on July 12, 1988. The company had already received overtures from
Shamrock, although the Disney group did not announce its bid
publicly for another eight days.
   ESOPs bind workers closer to their employers, and managers
fighting a takeover battle expect employees to stand with them when
the workers vote their stock at a shareholders meeting.
   ``The theory is the employees always vote along with management
and their jobs,'' said Lang, noting that workers fear layoffs in a
hostile takeover.
   There's little doubt how Polaroid employees would vote. They
signed petitions and held demonstrations against a Shamrock takeover.
   But in the course of the Polaroid-Shamrock battle, a possible
wrinkle emerged in ESOPs that could complicate their use as a
takeover defense: There's no guarantee that all the stock in a plan
will be voted according to employees' wishes.
   Under Polaroid's ESOP, a trustee votes the shares held by
individual employees according to their instructions. Shares issued
to the plan but not held by individual employees _ known as
unallocated shares _ are to be voted in the same proportion as
allocated shares, reflecting the employees' sentiment.
   The problem is with the unallocated shares.
   The Labor Department _ which has jurisdiction over ESOPs under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act _ told the trustee of
the Polaroid ESOP, Citizens and Southern Trust Co. of Atlanta, it
was not bound by the plan's provisions, and could decide for itself
how to vote the unallocated shares.
   The letter was not binding on the trustee. However, noted
attorney Lang, ``an expert agency is usually given high credence
when they interpret their own statutes,'' and the letter could be
given weight in a court decision.
   But Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for
Employee Ownership, doubted that if the department's stand were
tested in court and upheld it could survive the subsequent public
outcry.
   ``It would be a situation where employees are forced to sell a
company they don't want to,'' he said.
   Rosen said the Labor Department was looking at the employees as
shareholders seeking the maximum value for their stock instead of
workers concerned about their jobs.
   Citizens and Southern refused to discuss the issue or how it
might vote the unallocated shares, which account for 90 percent of
the ESOP. The entire plan holds nearly 14 percent of Polaroid's
stock.
   But Polaroid wasn't relying solely on its employees for support _
it was certain to have the votes of Corporate Partners, a
partnership formed to help companies block hostile takeover
attempts. Polaroid is paying as much as 11 percent annual dividends
to Corporate Partners, and placed two members of the partnership on
its board.
   Selling stock to a ``white sheik'' _ a party who will support a
company against a hostile suitor _ is not new. But some companies
have learned the hard way that the ploy can have undesirable
repercusssions.
   In 1984, Chris-Craft Industries Inc. helped Warner Communications
Inc. avoid an unwanted bid from publisher Rupert Murdoch by becoming
Warner's largest stockholder. Warner chairman Steven Ross has had
reason to regret the move _ he and Chris-Craft chairman Herbert
Siegel have been bickering ever since.
   The third part of Polaroid's defense, the stock buyback, has been
used by many companies seeking to protect themselves even if they're
not facing a takeover threat by having fewer vulnerable shares on
the market.
   General Motors Corp., Ryder System Inc., Borden Inc. and Tenneco
Inc. are among companies that recently have repurchased stock.
   In the fall of 1987, retailer Dayton Hudson Corp. was the target
of a hostile bid from Dart Group Corp. Then on Oct. 19, the stock
market collapsed, taking with it Dart's bid.
   Dayton Hudson wasted no time. It immediately started buying back
15 million shares.

   Changes in the two broadest measures of the
nation's money supply were mixed in the week ended March 13, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,078.1 billion from $3,083.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,951.1 billion from $3,948.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $784 billion from $791.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,069.8 billion, a 2.7

<HEAD>Eastern Moves Against Pilots in Court, Trains Replacements</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines moved against its
striking pilots on two fronts Thursday, asking a federal appeals
court to force them back to work while announcing that the company
will begin to train replacements soon.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Tallahassee took Eastern's appeal under advisement after an
hour-long hearing. Eastern asked the judges to overturn a lower
court ruling permitting the pilots to honor striking Machinists'
picket lines under the Railway Labor Act.
   ``The question is whether the RLA expressly forbids a sympathy
strike,'' said Judge R. Lanier Anderson III. ``That is the issue
before us.''
   In New York on Thursday, federal Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton
Lifland said he would appoint an examiner to oversee Eastern during
its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws. In a
move described as unusual by bankruptcy attorneys, Lifland said the
as-yet-unnamed examiner would be given the power to try to mediate
between Eastern and its creditors and employees, as well as gather
information.
   In the federal appeals court, Eastern attorney David Ross told
the judges that because the Air Line Pilots Association was
negotiating a new contract with Eastern, they could not strike for
any reason.
   ``The Railway Labor Act says you cannot strike in support of your
collective bargaining goals until you have exhausted all of the
procedures of that act, and there is no dispute those procedures
have not been exhausted,'' he told reporters afterward.
   But Jim Lindsey, who represented ALPA, argued that the pilots
have the right to stage a sympathy strike and that the federal
courts don't have the authority to define what a sympathy strike is.
Congress took that right away from the judicial branch in 1932,
Lindsey said.
   Lindsey said he thought the judges might rule sometime next week.
   In Miami, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said that despite ALPA's
contention the carrier could not find qualified pilots to replace
strikers, training for the first group of replacements was about to
start.
   ``We're hiring, no question about it,'' Matell said. ``The first
class starts on Monday, and that will have 30 or 40 people in it.
These are people who have been interviewed and passed the
examination.''
   In addition, he said, Eastern has received ``into the thousands
of phone calls'' in response to its ads seeking new pilots, which
began running Sunday.
   Ron Cole, spokesman for Eastern's ALPA pilots, dismissed the
hirings as unimportant, saying many pilots meet Federal Aviation
Administration requirements but aren't ready to work at a commercial
airline.
   ``This is a situation that the FAA is going to have to keep a
close eye on,'' he said.
   Eastern has been getting about 115 flights a day aloft recently,
said another spokewoman, Karen Ceremsak, and the new pilots will
increase that number. Before the strike, the company had more than
1,000 flights a day.
   After the bankruptcy court hearing in New York, both Eastern and
the pilots union said they agreed with the judge's decision to
appoint an examiner with power to act as a mediator.
   Eastern had asked Lifland to appoint an examiner to review all
transactions between Eastern and affiliated airlines during
bankruptcy proceedings. The unions have asked the bankruptcy court
to appoint a trustee, a more powerful official who actually would
run the airline during its bankruptcy reorganization.
   Lifland indicated his appointment of an examiner did not
necessarily mean he would not consider naming a trustee later. He
said he would ask the examiner to take on more than just
fact-finding duties in the hopes the examiner could ``mediate
differences'' between the embattled company and its unions and other
creditors.
   ``It sounds like a trustee, not an examiner,'' said Farrell
Kupersmith, chief financial adviser to the pilots' union.
   But Eastern President Phil Bakes also expressed no problems with
the judge's decision, saying, ``We wish we had thought of it.''

   British sugar refiner Tate and Lyle PLC on Thursday
said it agreed to acquire the parts of Canadian sugar group Redpath
Industries Ltd. that it didn't already own for about $240 million.
   Tate and Lyle said it would purchase the Canadian government's
49.9 percent holding in Redpath.
   Tate and Lyle said it plans to find buyers for Redpath's
non-sugar businesses, which include automotive, industrial and
consumer products. The company will try to find suitable Canadian
purchasers for these units, Tate and Lyle said, particularly for
operations based primarily in Canada.
   After completing the Redpath deal, Tate and Lyle will own 100
percent of its North American sugar interests. Redpath jointly owns
Tate and Lyle's U.S. sugar refiners Western Sugar and Amstar Sugar.
   The company said the purchase of the rest of Redpath will help it
simplify its North American sugar interests.
   Tate and Lyle also said Redpath had experienced ``significant''
growth over the past five years, with operating profit growing to
about $58.3 million in 1988.

<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it will soon
renew payments on Ecuador's $11 billion foreign debt after a more
than two-year suspension.
   ``Within the process of negotiations with private foreign banks
and after a 26-month suspension of interest payments, Ecuador will
make modest and partial installments this year,'' government
spokesman Washington Herrera said.
   Herrera declined to give further details. But the Central Bank
said payments are expected to be resumed in the coming weeks.
   The small Andean country has balked at repayments since the start
of a financial crisis incited by a major earthquake in March 1987,
which ruptured a key oil pipeline and paralyzed the petroleum export
industry for six months until line could be repaired.
   During the year previous, the economy suffered by drastically
declining world oil prices. Ecuador depends on oil sales for more
than 60 percent of its foreign exchange.
   President Rodrigo Borja called for renegotiations with foreign
creditors shortly after he took office in August 1988, and talks
began earlier this year.
   The Congress has allotted $500 million for debt payments in this
year's budget.

   The handful of companies involved in nuclear
fusion research aren't expecting any profit windfall as a result of
an advance claimed Thursday by researchers in Salt Lake City.
   Fusion plants built by private industry will some day provide
clean, safe and inexpensive power, but in spite of the announcement
that day remains several decades off, company officials said in
interviews.
   Two researchers said Thursday they produced controlled nuclear
fusion using high school-level chemistry that could lead to a
technology capable of driving electrical generators within a few
years.
   B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann
of the University of Southhampton in England cautioned that more
research is needed to determine whether the process will work on a
large scale.
   Officials in the tiny private sector of the nuclear fusion
business said they wanted to learn more about the work, but that
even in the best of circumstances it would only be a first step.
   ``We thought that during the 1980s fusion would be going into
engineering development that would require the private sector. That
would have happened, but the energy crisis went away'' and the
Reagan administration cut spending, said Stephen O. Dean, president
of Fusion Power Associates of Gaithersburg, Md.
   Fusion Power Associates was formed in 1979 as a group of private
companies and organizations involved in fusion work.
   ``We've sort of been in a holding pattern waiting for better
times in terms of government policies,'' Dean said. ``We need a
commitment to engineering development. We don't see how that can be
done in private industry.''
   Only two companies are gathering substantial revenue from nuclear
fusion, and in both cases the money comes entirely from government
funding, he said.
   General Atomics, a privately held company in San Diego, Calif.,
has a $30 million-a-year contract to operate an experimental
magnetic-confinement fusion device. It has other government
contracts worth $5 million to $6 million a year.
   KMS Fusion Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., makes fuel capsules that are
used as the targets of experimental laser-confinement fusion
reactors. The company is the only private company receiving
Department of Energy funding for laser fusion research. Its funding
is less than General Atomics', Dean said.

<HEAD>Centaur Drops $110-A-Share Bid For Pennwalt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centaur Partners ended its months-long
hostile takeover attempt of Pennwalt Corp. Thursday, announcing it
was dropping its $110-per-share offer.
   The withdrawal comes three days after the chemical company
announced it will accept a $132-per-share offer from the French
government-controlled oil and chemical concern Societe Nationale Elf
Aquitaine. Based on the number of Pennwalt's outstanding shares _ 8
million _ Elf Aquitaine's offer amounts to more than $1 billion.
   Centaur's announcement coincided with Elf Aquitaine's formal
commencement of the offer.
   Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of Pennwalt's stock, dropped
the offer because of the Elf Aquitaine development, the New
York-based investment group said in a statement. No officials were
available Thursday evening to comment on the decision, said Centaur
spokesman James D. Daniels.
   Pennwalt had fought Centaur since the investment group first made
its plans known last June.
   During the fight, Pennwalt sold off a pharmaceutical division and
most of its equipment business. The company also went to court to
stop Centaur from calling a shareholders meeting, where the
investment group hoped to replace the directors, paving the way for
the takeover bid to succeed.
   Pennwalt's chairman, Edwin E. Tuttle, maintained throughout the
takeover bid that the company believed Centaur never actually wanted
to acquire the company but merely wanted to drive up the stock
prices.
   Centaur does, indeed, stand to make a profit. The investment
group, headed by Abbey Butler and Melvin Estrin, began buying
Pennwalt stock in June when the price was $65 a share.
   It is estimated that Centaur's stock will bring the investors
more than $60 million.
   ``I can't imagine (Centaur's principals) are too upset,'' said
Don Pattison, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in New
York. ``Even if they were sincere about wanting to run the company,
a profit like that can certainly soften the disappointment.''
   Pennwalt spokeswoman Sue Kinard could not be reached for comment,
but Elf Aquitaine's spokesman Walter Montgomery said, ``There's not
much to comment on. This doesn't change Elf's position.''
   Pennwalt's stock closed unchanged at $130.25 Thursday in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock's price
jumped $13.12{ _ about 11 percent _ to $130.12{ when Elf Aquitaine's
offer was made public Monday.

   Columbia College students and unions supporting
the striking machinists at Eastern Airlines on Thursday called on
the college to withdraw a top alumni award to Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of the embattled airline.
   Some 300 students and supporters of the striking airline
employees chanted ``Union busting is disgusting,'' as they gathered
in front of Low Library on the Columbia campus, where Lorenzo and
five other prominent alumni were to have received the John Jay Award
at a dinner Thursday night.
   The college, an undergraduate school at Columbia University,
scrapped plans for the annual dinner last week because, according to
a statement, the atmosphere would have been marred by ``the current
emotional climate in the labor dispute between Eastern Airlines and
its machinists' union.''
   Fred Knubel, a college spokesman, when asked Thursday if the
school would withdraw Lorenzo's award, pointed to a sentence in last
Friday's statement, which read: ``The board of directors of the
Columbia College Alumni Association will decide on (its) next steps
at its fall meeting.''
   The John Jay Award is given to prominent alumni for their
achievements and service to the college.
   Dan Ashby, a spokesman for the Airline Pilots Association, told
the protesters, ``We are here tonight because we are outraged that
the president and board of trustees of Columbia have chosen to honor
Francisco Lorenzo at a time when he is destroying Eastern Airlines
and the lives of its 30,000 employees.''
   Knubel said the college would have no comment on the rally and
the petition.
   Also attending the was Leroy Washington, spokesman for the
International Association of Machinists. Other unions represented
were the Transport Workers Union, District 65 United Auto Workers
and Local 1199 Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers.

   Holly Farms Corp. directors have rejected
the latest buyout offer from rival poultry processor Tyson Foods
Inc., saying there is no way to ensure the $1.18 billion bid was
sound, Holly Farms said Thursday.
   Wednesday's rejection of the $63.50-a-share offer came the same
day that a Chancery Court judge in Delaware gave Holly Farms
permission to ask its shareholders on April 14 to approve a friendly
merger with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   But Judge Maurice Hartnett said no merger would be allowed until
legal questions surrounding the proposal were settled.
   The ConAgra-Holly merger would be accomplished through a stock
swap valued at $59.25 a share, or about $1 billion, while Tyson's
$1.18 billion offer is for cash.
   The struggle to acquire Holly Farms, a diversified Memphis
company heavily dependant on fresh fryer sales, began last October.
A takeover by Tyson Foods would permit the Springdale, Ark., company
to keep its standing as the nation's largest poultry processor.
   One of the main snags in the merger proposal announced last year
by Holly Farms and ConAgra is a lockup option that would permit
ConAgra to buy prime Holly assets should their proposed merger fall
through.
   Hartnett has yet to rule on the validity of that agreement, which
Tyson claims was designed to make Holly Farms unattractive to any
buyer other than ConAgra.
   Tyson's buyout offer is contingent on dissolution of the lockup,
which is why Holly Farms rejected it, Holly Farms said in a
statement.
   ``Until Tyson removes from its tender offer the `asset option'
condition, Holly Farms stockholders can have no assurance that
Tyson's $63.50 price represents deliverable value,'' the statement
said.
   John Tyson, son of Tyson President Don Tyson, said the Holly
Farms' rejection was ``about as anticipated.''
   Tyson Foods is filing proxy materials with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and hopes to get it to Holly stockholders
sometime next week, John Tyson said.

   A British and an American scientist said
Thursday they have produced controlled nuclear fusion using basic
chemistry that could lead to a technology capable of driving
electrical generators within a few years.
   ``What we have done is opened the door of a new research area,''
said Martin Fleischmann of Southampton University in England. ``Our
indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make
into a usable technology for generating heat and power.''
   Nuclear fusion, the power that fuels the sun, is regarded as
science's next great frontier in developing new sources of energy,
but has generally been considered to be years away from commercial
exploitation. It differs from conventional processes in that it
fuses atoms, rather than splits them, and generates little
radioactive waste.
   Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons, chairman of the University of
Utah's chemistry department, said at a news conference here that in
laboratory tests, their ``cold-temperature'' electrochemical process
has produced a surplus of energy for periods of up to 100 hours.
   However, the researchers cautioned that more research is needed
to determine whether the process will work on a large scale.
   ``We don't know what the implications are. The science base has
to be established as widely as possible to challenge our findings,''
Fleischmann said. ``But it does seem there is a possibility of
realizing sustained fusion in a relatively simple device.''
   If the technology is practical on a large scale, it would provide
a safe, relatively clean and virtually inexhaustible energy source.
   Other nuclear scientists said the experiment will have to be
duplicated independently before the findings of Pons and Fleischmann
can be accepted.
   ``People are pushing cold-temperature nuclear fusion quite
vigorously these days. Like any science, this claim has to be
reproducible. If it is indeed there, it is quite a discovery,'' said
Chan Choi, a fusion researcher at Purdue University's School of
Nuclear Engineering.
   Pons said that in the process, an electrical current is used to
drive nuclear particles through a lattice of palladium and platinum
electrodes, forcing positively charged particles to fuse together
and create a new atom.
   Unlike more traditional fusion techniques which require
tremendous heat, and are therefore very expensive, the
electrochemical process is carried out at room temperature in a
fragile glass flask.
   Scientists have sought a practical application of fusion for
about 35 years. Existing nuclear reactors are powered by nuclear
fission.
   Pons said the amount of deuterium, the source of the deuteron
particles used in the process, contained in one cubic foot of
seawater could produce as much energy as 10 tons of coal.
   Pons said he and Fleischmann had developed the technique after 5{
years of research and financed it with about $100,000 of their own
money. They conceived of the idea while hiking in a canyon east of
Salt Lake City and conducted their first experiment on Pons' kitchen.
   ``Stan and I thought the experiment was so stupid, we financed it
ourselves,'' Fleischmann said. ``If you scale it up, we could burn
up a few million.''
   Fleischmann said the research has been submitted to a scientific
journal, which he declined to name. If accepted, it would be
published in May, he said.
   The pair now are seeking a grant from the federal Department of
Energy to continue their research. University of Utah President
Chase Peterson said the school has applied for patents to cover the
techniques in the United States and internationally.
   ``Everything we know about it says it ought to have commercial
application,'' he said.
   Purdue's Chan said most ``cold-fusion'' research involves using a
subatomic particle as a catalyst to start the fusion reaction, while
the main thrust of fusion research has involved heating particles to
superhot temperatures of more than 1 million degrees while
simultaneously compressing them.
   ``The low temperature is quite a departure from the norm. If the
(research) is correct, that's quite an achievement,'' he said.
   To create fusion, scientists must prevent positive ions from
repelling one another so that they can fuse together. Richard L.
Morse, a professor of physics and nuclear engineering at the
University of Arizona, said this can be done by accelerating them to
a high velocity _ by heating them or by using a particle accelerator
_ or by blocking out the positive trait.
   Cold fusion, he said, attempts to block the natural repulsion.
   ``I'd be a little skeptical that anything of economic value could
be achieved this way,'' Morse said. ``Some of the limitations are
pretty fundamental.''
