<HEAD>Apartment Fires Kill Nine Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion set off a raging fire at a Pennsylvania apartment
complex Monday, killing five children, and a New York City row house
fire killed four children who authorities say apparently were
playing with matches or a lighter.
   ``It's the type of thing that would give you nightmares,''
neighbor Harry Isaacs said in recalling seeing a burned child
carried from the top floor of a three-story brick row house that
went up in flames in Brooklyn.
   The cause of the afternoon explosion at apartments near Chester,
Pa., was undetermined.
   Detective Sgt. Floyd Sudler identified the three boys and two
girls killed as Ronald A. French, 6; Carl C. French, 5; Shelia
French, 4; Robert French, 3; and Robin Jones, 2. The mother of the
five children, as well as 13-month-old Marlon Arnold, who was
critically injured, is Michelle Arnold, 25, Sudler said.
   Witnesses said Ms. Arnold was outside the two-story apartments
talking to friends when the explosion occurred. Authorities said the
children were inside, but they did not know how many other people
were inside apartment and had to be evacuated.
   In Brooklyn, adult family members were unable to rescue the
children because the victims had placed a mattress against a door
that created what Fire Department spokesman Efrain Parrilla
described as a ``wall of fire.''
   Chief Fire Marshal John Regan said it appeared the children were
playing with matches or a lighter.
   Firefighters controlled the blaze in 30 minutes Monday afternoon
and found an unused smoke detector in a closet, Parrilla said.
   He identified the victims as Glenora Murray, 8, Joseph Raspberry,
5, Ruby Janette Murray, 4, and Lenora Murray, 5.
   Parrilla said the children were playing in a bedroom. Their
mothers, sisters Gail and Devoria Murray, were in the back part of
the apartment in the kitchen when they smelled smoke, he said.

<HEAD>Academy of Jewish Learning to Open in Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first school of Jewish studies in the Soviet
Union since the time of Stalin will open officially in Moscow this
Wednesday, says a professor who plans to lecture there.
   The opening of the yeshiva, which will train rabbis and scholars,
represents a historic event, said David Berger, a history professor
at Brooklyn College here. It marks the first time in 60 years that
the Soviet government has allowed the study of Jewish law.
   Berger said anyone who might have suggested an academy of Jewish
studies in the Soviet Union five years ago ``would have been locked
up.''
   He said the yeshiva will be independent of the government.
   ``They are not controlling the faculty at all,'' the professor
said. ``All of us are completely independent. They are not, as far
as I know, controlling the student body either.''
   The Judaic Studies Center, which will occupy an apartment complex
owned by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is a joint project of the
academy and Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, a noted Israeli scholar.
   The Soviet government will provide stipends for the students.
Financial support will also come from the Aleph Society, a group of
philanthropists that supports Steinsaltz in his other work, Berger
said.
   Between 75 and 80 students will study at the center. The course
of instruction will include the Bible, Jewish law and Jewish
history. The first semester will last seven weeks; future semesters
will last four months.
   Berger said that some of the students, many of whom are in
university or have graduated, ``have managed to get a substantial
quantity of Jewish knowledge.'' He suggested that some of the
students may have studied or taught Hebrew in clandestine classes.
   The availability of books may present a problem, according to
Berger. ``The basic library is being brought from Israel,'' he said.
   In addition to Steinsaltz and Berger, the faculty will include
rabbis from Chicago and Jerusalem.
   Official attitudes toward Jews and Jewish culture in the Soviet
Union have become more liberal recently. Last week, the first
officially approved Jewish cultural center in the Soviet Union
opened in Moscow.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union has increased, and Israel
and Russia have exchanged consular officials.

   A retired welder who says he separates
two-ply toilet paper to save money won top tightwad honors in a
newspaper's ``How Cheap Are You?'' contest.
   ``It's no trouble at all; it just takes a little practice,'' Luis
Torres said Sunday. He said his single-ply rolls are ``just as good
as two-ply'' and save about 23 cents each.
   Torres, 64, who attributes his frugal ways to growing up with 14
siblings, says he buys day-old baked goods and meats, generic
groceries and ``whatever's on sale.'' He also says he reuses plastic
bags and never tosses out that final sliver of soap.
   ``I always did things to save money,'' said Torres. ``I've done
everything there is to make or save a dollar. I'm not embarrassed at
all.''
   The Oakland Tribune, which asked readers to submit their
money-saving ideas, cited other skinflints in the categories of
gross, tacky, unbelievable, incredible and dihonest.
   Among the gross, a Berkeley couple said they save dental floss on
a bathroom hook for reuse, and a Richmond man claimed he refreezes
used ice cubes.
   As for tacky, one couple said they collect two-for-one coupons to
restaurants and then invite another couple. ``We make them pay for
their half, and we dine free,'' they wrote the newspaper.
   In the unbelievable category, one person wrote: ``I regulate my
bodily functions so that I go to the bathroom during work hours.
This saves on water, tissue and time. I can spend my hours at home
doing something constructive, like cutting off expiration dates on
coupons.''
   An incredible submission came from Elmer Hurren in El Cerrito,
who said that when his vacuum cleaner bag fills, he cuts one end,
empties it and sews it up for reuse.
   ``Not only does it save bags, but sometimes I find a penny in the
dust,'' he said.
   As for people who perhaps can't distinquish between cheap and
cheat, one man admitted he carries a paper bag with ``Out of Order''
written on it. He places the bag on parking meters next to his car.

<HEAD>Despite Gorbachev's Moves, No Cuts in Defense Spending Yet</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's flirtation with
the West appears to have captured the hearts of Europeans, but their
governments have not yet made up their minds whether to give in on
defense spending.
   Overall military expenditures by the United States' allies in the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization are likely to rise a
bit this year.
   However, Gorbachev's dramatic announcements of defense and troop
reductions were made only recently and analysts say their impact, if
any, will not likely show up until budget planners get to work in
coming months.
   Western officials have so far praised the Soviet leader's
promises of reform but also urged caution in modifying their own
defense plans.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain has said, ``While we
wish Mr. Gorbachev well, we nevertheless have to keep our defenses
strong so that whatever may happen, freedom and justice and
democracy in the West will remain secure.''
   Premier Michel Rocard of France recently urged ``the greatest
prudence'' until promises to reshape and cut back on Soviet military
might are carried out. Canada's external affairs minister, Joe
Clark, said, ``The West still must face formidable and
ever-improving Soviet forces.''
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top military commander in Europe,
cautioned in a recent interview, ``There is some dangerous thinking
going on in NATO ... that there has been a big military change in
the Soviet Union.''
   ``We should be careful about our perceptions of how things are
today in terms of our security ... Let's keep our powder dry.''
   John Cross, deputy director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, doubted governments will cut military
spending: ``It's more likely for the moment that the improved
climate would be advanced as a reason for not doing more than for
than scaling back.''
   A NATO official, however, expressed concern. ``It's going to get
harder to get parliaments to allocate (the money) necessary for
defense,'' said the official, who demanded anonymity.
   Defense spending for the United States' allies will edge up 0.7
percent this year, according to NATO forecasts, whereas last year's
spending was off an estimated 0.5 percent.
   U.S. defense spending soared from 1980 to 1986, but has since
eased. President Bush proposed a $308.8 billion military budget for
the 1990 fiscal year, holding outlays at current levels after
inflation.
   In the late 1970s, the United States pressed NATO for a 3 percent
annual increase in each country's defense budget, a sum that became
a rough guide for measuring military expenditures.
   But most NATO governments have not met that goal and some U.S.
lawmakers contend the Europeans are not paying enough for their own
defense.
   This question of ``burden-sharing'' may become more troublesome
as Europeans view the threat of an attack from the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact as less likely. Gorbachev appears to be immensely popular in
Europe.
   _ In Britain, a Harris poll for the Observer, a liberal weekly
newspaper, found 60 percent of voters questioned said Gorbachev
would make a greater contribution to world peace and 18 percent
picked Bush. The rest didn't know.
   _ West Germans also have taken to the Soviet leader. A recent
survey by the Emnid firm found the weakest commitment to defense
spending in 26 years.
   Yet neither Chancellor Helmut Kohl nor his foreign minister,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has urged less money for defense. Indeed,
military expenditures are projected to go up 1.4 percent this year
after 0.3 percent decline in 1988.
   Italy's defense spending also is expected to climb this year, up
0.8 percent, after falling about 1.1 percent.
   In France, the military budget is projected to rise 1.2 percent
this year, above last year's 0.5 percent increase.
   British defense expenditures are forecast to slump 0.7 percent
this year; they tumbled some 3.1 percent last year.
   Greece, with its defense budget soaring roughly 10 percent last
year, may expand spending by only 0.6 percent this year, though
Premier Andreas Papandreou has backed Gorbachev's peace efforts.
   ``This government, based on its fixed policy in favor of peace
and disarmament, can only praise every initiative in this
direction,'' he said after the Soviet leader announced troops cuts
in a December speech at the United Nations.
   In Turkey, the Soviet Union, once feared as having designs on its
territory, has acquired a more benign image.
   One of two NATO countries bordering the Soviet Union, Turkey has
600,000 men under arms, the largest armed forces in the alliance
after the United States. Its military spending was forecast to go up
3.3 percent this year, following an approximate 3.4 percent gain in
1988.
   Norway, the other NATO nation with a Soviet border, is likely to
raise its defense budget 1.9 percent this year, after a 1.3 percent
decline last year.
   Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg said Gorbachev's U.N.
speech reflected ``innovative thinking.'' But he added, ``There is
no reduction of military buildup on the Soviet side in northern
areas.''
   Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen of Denmark complained that
the Kremlin has done nothing about Warsaw Pact forces along the
Baltic.
   The buildup, he said, is ``a serious threat...which rhymes poorly
with desires to ease tensions and create confidence in Europe.''
   Denmark's defense spending was projected to slip 2.2 percent this
year after climbing 2.8 percent in 1988.
   Other NATO spending forecasts for this year were: Belgium, down
4.4 percent; Canada, up 2.9 percent; Luxembourg, up 9.9 percent; the
Netherlands, up 0.7 percent; Portugal, up 3 percent, and Spain, up
0.4 percent.
   Iceland, the 16th nation in NATO, has no military forces.

<HEAD>South African Swimmer's Australian Wife Says He Married To Compete</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Australian woman seeking a divorce
from a South African swimmer says she married him to help him try to
obtain Australian citizenship and compete in the Olympics.
   Lani Engels, 20, described her highly publicized marriage to Gary
Brinkman as ``a sham,'' said she had to buy both their wedding rings
and that they were separated the day after wedding last April.
   ``We weren't lovers. The whole thing was a set-up,'' Engels told
newspapers in her hometown of Brisbane. ``I just wish it never
happened. I really regret it.''
   Brinkman, 24, who was South Africa's leading freestyle swimmer
when he arrived last year, had advertised in various newspapers and
appeared on television seeking an Australian wife.
   South Africa is barred from the Olympic Games because of its
apartheid policy of racial separation, which denies the black
majority a vote in national affairs.
   Ms. Engels said she married Brinkman hoping he would gain
citizenship to compete in the Australian Olympic Games trials. His
bid failed when the Australian Government declined his request for
citizenship.
   Brinkman was not immediately available for comment.
   Ms. Engels says that after her divorce from Brinkman is finalized
she plans to wed Nigel Guy, her boyfriend of four years by whom she
says she is four months pregnant.

   A twin-engine plane possibly carrying 10
people was reported overdue Sunday on a flight from Las Vegas to
Southern California, authorities said.
   The Civil Air Patrol began a search and the Federal Aviation
Administration was trying to determine whether the plane was missing
or had landed somewhere, said FAA regional duty officer Tommy Aina.
   Controllers talked to the pilot shortly after noon as the plane
was inbound to Orange County John Wayne Airport but there was no
subsequent emergency declaration from the pilot, Aina said.
   The Civil Air Patrol asked the public to notify authorities if
they saw or heard anything unusual around Pleasants Peak near
Corona, said patrol Lt. Col. Ed Crankshaw.
   The plane disappeared from radar at about 2,100 feet near the
peak, Crankshaw said. Pleasants Peak stands 4,007 feet in the Santa
Ana Mountains on the Orange-Riverside county line.
   Crankshaw said the plane had 10 people aboard, including the
pilot, but he could not release names. Aina could not confirm the
number of people aboard.
   The Cessna 402 left Las Vegas about 11 a.m. and was due at John
Wayne at 12:30 p.m., Crankshaw said.
   Two ground teams searched the Pleasant Peak area and CAP
volunteers prepared to fly aerial search missions at dawn.

<HEAD>Animal Keeper Says She Forgives Monkeys Who Mauled Her</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal keeper says she intends to return to her
job when she recovers from a mauling by seven monkeys who bit and
clawed her for 15 minutes before she jumped in a lake to save
herself.
   Vanessa Dennis, 26, head primate keeper at Kilverstone Wildlife
Park in Norfolk, eastern England, was locking up the monkeys for the
night on Feb. 1 when she was set upon by the seven white-throated
Capuchins, whom she had looked after for almost five years.
   After the 15-minute struggle in which she was severely bitten and
clawed on her head, neck, arms and legs, she managed to throw off
the last remaining animal and scream for help.
   She then jumped into a lake until she was pulled out by another
keeper, Steve West. ``She was in total shock. The troop wanted her
dead,'' he said.
   Miss Dennis spent four days being treated for deep wounds at West
Suffolk Hospital in Bury St. Edmunds and was then allowed home. A
local newspaper first reported her ordeal on Friday.
   Miss Dennis said Sunday that the attack was led by the dominant
male named Percy, which leaped screaming at her neck and was
followed by the others. She said she thought Percy might have been
enraged by something behind her which she did not see.
   ``They were clinging to any flesh they could reach. The male
clung relentlessly _ I remember thinking I was dead and he had
severed my jugular, the pain was so intense,'' the keeper said.
   ``I am going back because the animals are my life. I can forgive
them and still care for and love them,'' she said.

   Peter Allen opened the second act of ``Legs
Diamond'' by rising from a coffin and declaring, ``Not even critics
can kill me,'' but his musical was on its last legs.
   The curtain closed on the final performance of the $5.3 million
Broadway bomb Sunday, less than two months after the show about a
big-time New York mobster opened.
   ``Legs'' opened at the end of December to dismal reviews after an
unusually long run of 72 preview performances. There were 64 regular
performances.
   The last show drew two standing ovations: one at the end and one
for the death-defying stunt by Allen, who also wrote the music and
lyrics. The book was by Harvey Fierstein and Charles Suppon.
   The historic Mark Hellinger Theater will close and be turned over
to the Times Square Church, which has rented the building for five
years at $1 million a year, according to the Nederlander theater
organization, which helped produce the show.

   British rock star Sting, meeting with
President Jose Sarney, proposed a worldwide campaign to raise funds
to save the Amazon jungle and create a massive Indian reservation.
   ``We would like to help Brazil create South America's largest
Indian reservation, and I am sure we could make lots of money in the
United States, Japan and Europe for this project,'' Sting told
journalists outside the presidential palace after his two-hour
meeting with Sarney on Sunday.
   ``We need the permission of the Brazilian people for this,'' the
singer-songwriter said. ``We want to help Brazil save the Amazon.''
The Brazilian government has made it clear it won't accept what it
sees as recent foreign meddling in Amazon affairs.
   Sting said he would travel to France, Italy, West Germany, Spain,
England, the United States, Japan and China to raise funds for the
proposed 129,000-square-mile reservation and other Amazonian
ecological projects.
   Sting is in Brazil for a weeklong meeting with Indians from 28
Brazilian tribes and international ecologists, who fear that
destruction of the world's largest tropical rain forest could
contribute to global warming through the greenhouse effect.

declined to head the state's ethics panel because of time
constraints.
   ``I have had some discussions with the governor's office about

   The couple declined to comment when they arrived at Logan
International Airport on Saturday, with Bonner saying they wanted
``private time.''
   The Sakharovs came here to visit their grandchildren in suburban

   ``As far as I know he does not intend to make any public
appearances. He will be here I don't know how long but probably just

   The couple had been in Canada for a week. Sakharov received a

   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights

   Bobby Hull returned to the city he put
on the hockey map as the Winnipeg Jets retired his number a decade
after he left the team.
   ``I don't know how you expect me to talk after that,'' a
choked-up Hull said Sunday night after receiving a series of
tributes and gifts, including a Jets' No. 9 jersey presented by team
captain Dale Hawerchuk.
   ``I was 50 years old in January,'' Hull said. ``I've played in
Stanley Cup-final seventh games, represented my country _ but I've
never had this kind of feeling before.
   ``I've never cried before, either.''
   The star left winger with the 100 mph slap shot, nicknamed the
Golden Jet, stunned the hockey world in 1972 by accepting a
$2.75-million deal to jump to Winnipeg from the National Hockey
League's Chicago Blackhawks.
   Among those honoring Hull before the Jets' game against the
Hartford Whalers was Gordie Howe, the NHL's all-time scoring leader,
who was a teammate of Hull's in Hartford in 1980.
   ``The strength of the man, the beautiful stride ... his
particular style captured the imagination of everybody,'' said Howe,
the only other player to have his number retired by two teams.
Howe's sweaters hang in Hartford and Detroit, and Hull's number also
has been retired in Chicago.

<HEAD>Secretary of State Says Death Threat Against Novelist ``Intolerable''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III accused
Iran of ``state-sponsored terrorism'' in the death threat against
novelist Salman Rushdie.
   ``The United States continues to oppose terrorism in all of its
forms, in particular state-sponsored terrorism,'' Baker said Sunday
on the NBC-TV ``Meet the Press'' program.
   Rushdie has said he did not intend to insult fellow Moslems in
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' However, Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini on Sunday refused to accept the apology and said
Rushdie still should be killed.
   Baker's comments follow statements by President Bush in his first
weeks in office indicating the administration's desire to improve
relations with Iran.
   But Baker said in the interview, ``If Iran really is serious
about rejoining the community of civilized nations, this is not the
kind of behavior that leads to that.
   ``This is behavior that is basically intolerable,'' he said.
   Just back from meeting U.S. allies in Europe, Baker also said in
the wide-ranging interview that:
   _U.S. and West German officials are not at odds over statements
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that he cannot decide whether to support
the modernization of NATO land-based nuclear missiles in Europe
until after elections in 1990.
   _The Bush administration is withholding immediate judgment of a
tentative Central American agreement to disband Nicaragua's Contra
guerrillas in return for commitment by that nation's leftist
Sandinista government to hold free elections and stop meddling in
the affairs of its neighbors.
   The United States will work with other members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization on nuclear force modernization, seeking
to reach a consensus before a planned NATO summit in late May, Baker
said.
   ``I found no one during the course of this trip who did not feel
that we should ... maintain a land-based nuclear missile in
Europe,'' Baker said.
   He stressed that he had not expected a commitment on the issue
from the West Germans, where popular opinion favors removal of all
nuclear weapons.
   ``We understand the delicateness of the issue from their
standpoint,'' said Baker. ``There is no disagreement. We have our
view. ... I firmly believe that we will be able to work this out
satisfactorily between now and the end of May.''
   Notwithstanding the Central American agreement, said Baker, ``We
have at the very least a moral obligation to seek humanitarian aid
for the Contras when it expires on March 31, and I believe that
President Bush has indicated that he would be doing so.
   ``There are some elements to the agreement that look promising,
the idea of democratization in Nicaragua, the idea of
non-interference by Nicaragua in the affairs of its neighbors. But
of course these are promises that Nicaragua has made before,'' said
Baker.
   ``There needs to be ... some sort of enforcement mechanism to
make sure that the Sandinistas keep the promises they have already
made,'' he said.

<BYLINE>Bush Visits Tokyo During Lull in Trade Friction ^By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's visit to Japan this week comes
as the stormy relations brought on by trade frictions between the
world's two largest economies have subsided.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, the United State's main ally
in Asia, remains more than $50 billion a year, has begun inching
downward and the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the
Japanese yen appears to be at a stable level.
   ``Things are rather harmonious at the moment,'' said John
Williamson, an analyst at the Institute for International Economics.
   ``The United States is pleased with the recent steps taken by
Japan. The Japanese may not be as pleased with U.S. progress on
lowering the budget deficit, but not so much that it will be an area
of particular friction,'' Williamson said.
   The Japanese see the bulging U.S. budget deficit _ expected to be
about $160 billion _ as a major cause of the trade imbalance between
the two nations, partly because it prompts a heavy inflow of foreign
cash into U.S. investments to help finance the shortfall while
sapping U.S. capital needed for private investment.
   Japan has promised to import more goods from the rest of the
world. And the United States has promised to work to lower its
budget deficit. These joint goals were reaffirmed in the meeting
earlier this month between President Bush and Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Takeshita was the first foreign leader Bush invited to the White
House.
   And while they weren't quite on the first-name basis that former
President Reagan and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone enjoyed
and trumpeted, they parted company with upbeat predictions of even
better U.S.-Japan relations in the years to come.
   After the two met for nearly three hours on Feb. 2, Bush declared
that differences between the two countries were ``the differences of
friends'' and Takeshita heralded ``a new start of U.S.-Japan
cooperation.''
   The funeral of Emperor Hirohito _ the stated purpose of Bush's
first overseas trip as president _ seemed likely to keep Takeshita
preoccupied, and analysts said they do not expect much in the way of
U.S.-Japanese policy discussions during Bush's stay in Japan.
   In fact, Bush planned to spend much of his time there meeting
with other world leaders. He has scheduled more than a dozen such
bilateral sessions during his two-day visit.
   Bush's decision to meet with other leaders during the funeral
visit irritated some Japanese officials. Part of Bush's decision to
invite Takeshita to Washington first, analysts suggest, was an
effort to smooth over any hurt feelings on this score.
   A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Bush would keep his meeting with other heads of
state low-key while in Tokyo.
   They will not offend protocol ``as long as they're done
quietly,'' the official said. He said that state funerals ``have
become a place where lots of people get together.''
   While U.S.-Japanese relations are generally good, there are still
some sore points. Among them:
   _Computer chips. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers continue to
complain that Japan isn't opening its markets adequately to their
products, despite a 1986 agreement calling for such.
   _Rice sales. The Reagan administration complained repeatedly of
Japan's virtual ban on accepting foreign-grown rice. The Bush
administration is expected to pursue these complaints, largely on
behalf of California rice growers.
   _Jet fighters. The Bush administration has delayed until after
the Asian trip a decision on whether to honor a Reagan
administration agreement with Japan for a joint jet-fighter project.
   Under the agreement, General Dynamics of the United States and
Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industry would join forces to build
so-called FSX jet fighters, a new version of the F-16 fighter.
Critics in Congress have labeled the project an $8 billion giveaway
of U.S. high technology and have called on Bush to cancel U.S.
participation.
   The Japanese government says it needs a final go-ahead from the
United States by March 31 to get funds for the project into its
current budget.
   _Defense spending. Some U.S. leaders _ including Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower _ have complained recently that Japan
has not been contributing enough to its own defense. Bush touched on
this subject indirectly, saying: ``I noted the importance of allies
assuming greater responsibilities in the cause of peace. The prime
minister and I agreed that these responsibilities take many forms.''
   _Third World aid. Japan's efforts to spend more money in aid to
Third World nations was received coolly by the Reagan
administration, which irritated some Japanese leaders. However, the
Bush administration has been more receptive toward the idea,
praising Japan's recent commitment for a 7.8 percent increase in its
budget for such aid. Japan has vowed to spend $50 billion in aid to
the developing nations from 1988 to 1992.
   Japan also has proposed a new way of speeding up trade disputes
with the United States through establishment of a special oversight
panel of high-level U.S. and Japanese officials.
   U.S. response has been lukewarm. ``We do have very good
mechanisms right now,' said Gaston J. Sigur, assistant secretary of
State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
   However, Sigur said the United States remains open to any new
suggestions on solving trade disputes, and will give the plan
serious study.

<HEAD>Unusual Study Provides Glimpse Of Teens' Psyche</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study in which students carried electronic
beepers and recorded their feelings when buzzed provided an unusual
glimpse into the adolescent psyche and indicates some stereotypes
are false, researchers say.
   University of Illinois and Loyola University researchers gave
beepers to 480 students in grades five to nine in suburbs southwest
of Chicago and asked them to write down their thoughts when buzzed
every two hours or so.
   The results: 20,000 musings on adolescent concerns ranging from
television to love, including the finding that most youths felt best
doing sports and worst doing homework.
   ``We hope that this study will not merely be 20,000 individual
snapshots, but rather a motion picture of what life as an adolescent
is actually like,'' the researchers write in an article accepted for
publication in the journal Child Development this September.
   Contrary to the popular image of music-crazed adolescents glued
to their stereos, girls who took part in the study reported
listening to music only 1.8 hours a week, compared with 1.2 hours a
week among boys.
   Overall, girls spent more time studying, talking and grooming and
less time watching television than boys, the study found.
   But regardless of sex or age, the participants didn't appear to
enjoy television much, reporting average or below-average moods
while watching it, the researchers said.
   Ninth-graders said they were in bad moods about 11 percent of the
time, compared to 6 percent for fifth-graders. By contrast, the
younger students reported feeling great 25 percent of the time,
compared to 12 percent among the ninth-graders.
   The older teen-agers ``face more difficulties as they move into
junior high school and the dating life,'' said University of
Illinois researcher Reed Larson. ``They become less naive and more
aware that life isn't all roses.''
   His colleague, Loyola psychologist Maryse Richards, said the
study provides a more accurate portrait than traditional research in
which subjects are interviewed or asked to fill out questionnaires
about past events or feelings.
   Memories can play tricks when people try to recall exact details
of their lives, Ms. Richards said.
   Students carried beepers between 1985 and 1987, and the
researchers plan a follow-up on the same students next year.
   The researchers said some of their findings were more surprising
than others.
   As expected, older youths reported feeling in love more often
than younger students. But sports got high marks as a favored
activity for all age groups.
   ``Kids feel better doing sports than just about any other
activity,'' Ms. Richards said. ``They feel most energized, happy and
cheerful.''
   Girls did about seven hours a week of homework while boys did
about six, she said. ``Of all their activities, they feel worst
while doing homework,'' Ms. Richards said.
   About 30 percent of eighth- and ninth-grade girls were
excessively worried about their weight, compared to less than 10
percent of the boys.
   Overall, boys spent more time doing yard work, and girls did more
cooking and cleaning.
   ``There's a lot more sex typing than I thought,'' Ms. Richards
said. ``We're still treating kids with the expectation they will
become traditional men and women.''

   Van Johnson has had to change his phone
number, but the cranberry grower isn't about to change his mailing
address after being named Cosmopolitan magazine's bachelor of the
month.
   ``The mail makes any kidding I've gotten about it OK,'' said
Johnson, whom the magazine dubbed its ``hunky harvester.''
   The 29-year-old farmer said he has received letters from
throughout the United States and Canada, and even from Australia and
Trinidad.
   ``At first I felt real shy,'' Johnson said. ``But in the letters
they say, `Hoping to hear from you.'''
   So far, Johnson says he's met only one woman in Boston through
the article, but she wasn't his type. He has called women in several
states.
   Johnson gave a brief description of his interests to a writer in
November after his sister, Beth, secretly submitted his name to the
women's magazine.
   The magazine article says Johnson operates 130 acres of bogs and
likes to ``hop on his blue Harley-Davidson and head for the Cape Cod
clubs with a `fun-loving intellectually stimulating woman.''' The
biography encouraged ``motorcycle mamas'' to write a post office box
in Carver, about 35 miles southeast of Boston.
   Johnson said he doesn't ride his motorcycle to clubs because he
wouldn't drink and drive, and claimed he isn't looking for
``motorcycle mamas.'' But he did say he plans to answer all his
letters.

   Photo-filching fans of Sports Illustrated's
popular swimsuit issue don't cut it with librarian Jamie Prather. So
she cuts up the magazine first.
   ``We've taken the swimsuit photo section and cut it out of the
magazine and put those photos behind the front desk. Then we put a
sticker on the magazine which says swimsuit photos are available at
the desk.'' said Prather, who works at a public library in this city
nearly 20 miles east of Flint.
   The library took similar precautions to preserve the previous
three swimsuit editions, Prather said.
   ``We don't take the pictures out because they're particularly
racy,'' she explained. ``It's available to everyone. But they do
tend to get lost.''
   Prather's counterparts at other public and school libraries have
taken similar precautions with the swimsuit issue published earlier
this month.
   Jane Lajawski, librarian at Powers Catholic High School in Flint,
said she has kept the magazine intact by keeping it off the shelves.
   ``We keep it behind the desk in the event a student wants to
research an article,'' she said.

<HEAD>Nursing Homes Say New Law May Hinder Care for Mentally Ill</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lede to restore word `retarded'; picks up 2nd graf pvs,
The law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nursing home owners say a new federal law that
is aimed at assuring care for mentally ill and mentally retarded
patients may instead force these people into the streets.
   The law, which went into effect Jan. 1, is designed to prevent
warehousing of mentally ill and mentally retarded patients in
nursing homes and assure that they get the specialized treatment
they need.
   Nursing homes are being told they will lose Medicaid funds if
they accept patients who suffer from mental illness or mental
retardation unless they also need nursing care because the homes
don't offer such specialized services.
   ``Ostensibly this law is out to do a good thing, but it simply
will not work given the reality of what's available,'' Paul
Willging, executive vice president of the American Health Care
Association, which represents nursing homes said.
   ``It will mean great numbers of homeless mentally ill and
mentally retarded people,'' he said.
   Willging estimates that 5 percent to 10 percent of the nation's
1.5 million patients in Medicaid-certified nursing homes are
mentally ill or mentally retarded.
   Government officials say the nursing homes' warnings are off base
and advocates for the mentally ill and mentally retarded who
supported the law say they have no evidence that people are being
turned out into the streets.
   Terry Coleman, deputy administrator of the federal Health Care
Financing Administration, said the law is an effort ``to get states
to develop additional programs for the mentally retarded and
mentally ill, like small group homes and community-based services.''
   Historically, it has been the states' responsibility to fund
services and facilities for the mentally ill, he said. To avoid this
cost, however, some states have channeled these patients into
nursing homes, where Medicaid picks up the tab for those who are
poor.
   States more often have special facilities for the mentally
retarded because Medicaid funding is available for these, but
nursing home care is often cheaper.
   Asked whether the law would result in more homeless people,
Coleman said: ``It may, if the states refuse to develop new
programs.''
   Adding to the outcry is the Health Care Financing
Administration's delay in putting regulations in place to guide
states and nursing homes in implementing the law. Regulations won't
be ready until spring, but states and nursing homes still must
comply with the terms of the law in the meantime.
   ``There is enormous confusion,'' said Sara Speights, spokeswoman
for the Texas Health Care Association, which is trying to block
implementation of the law in court. ``A lot of cases are unclear _ a
lot of people are on medications, a lot have had strokes and are
depressed. Is this considered a mental illness?''
   Critics also fear that while the law does not consider
Alzheimer's disease a mental illness, some Alzheimer's patients may
be wrongly classified and turned away.
   Other lawsuits have been filed in Idaho, where a temporary
restraining order blocking implementation has been issued, and in
Louisiana.
   Willging said that while the concept of the law is ``wonderful,''
most states don't have enough alternative facilities to handle the
number of people that could be turned away from nursing homes by the
law.
   Nursing homes have much at stake under the new law. More than 40
percent of the nation's nursing home costs are borne by the
federal-state Medicaid program, the health-care association said.
   ``Nursing homes provide good health-care services,'' Willging
said. ``It's true that nursing homes don't specialize in active
treatment (for the mentally ill and mentally retarded) ... but isn't
it a darn sight better than shipping people out to where they won't
get any services whatsoever?''
   Joe Manes, senior policy analyst with the Mental Health Law
Project, an advocacy group for the mentally ill and mentally
retarded, said the nursing homes' outcry is self-serving.
   ``What they're afraid of is they aren't going to get paid,'' he
said.
   Other groups that represent the mentally ill and mentally
retarded are cautiously monitoring implementation of the law.
   ``We are nervous ... but we don't want our people to be placed in
nursing homes if they can't get the services they need,'' said Chris
Koyanagi of the National Mental Health Association. ``They have been
warehoused in nursing homes ... simply because federal reimbursement
has been available.''

   The dollar ended trading almost unchanged against
the Japanese yen in Tokyo today, but stock prices set another record
high.
   The dollar opened at 125.30 yen, down from Friday's closing of
125.72 yen. But it then moved up to close at 125.75 yen, up 0.03 yen
from Friday's closing and its high for the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 89.91 points on Friday, added another
3.69 points, or 0.01 percent, closing at 32,177.08.
   Dealers said activity was slow in Tokyo because of a market
holiday in the United States in observance of President's Day.
   The Nikkei soared over 100 points to a new high shortly after the
start of trading but fell back on lack of enthusiasm toward the end
of the early session.
   ``Investors sometimes get tired of hearing about new record highs
every day,'' said a dealer at Nikko Securities. ``They sometimes
want to sit back and take a break.''
   Added another dealer: ``The bullish sentiment is still strong in
the market, but trading is rather directionless.''
   Tokyo was also showing little reaction to a U.S. trade report
issued last week which revealed that the American trade deficit
narrowed to $11.89 billion in December from a revised $12.22 billion
the previous month, said another dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The report was ``largely within expectations,'' the dealer added.

   Several explosions rocked a British army barracks
in western England on Monday, and guards fired shots at two people
seen running away, the Ministry of Defense said.
   A ministry spokesman said it was believed there were no
casualties inside the Turnhill barracks near Shrewsbury, 160 miles
northwest of London. The barracks serve as headquarters of the 2nd
Parachute Regiment.
   The buildings were shaken by three or four blasts, said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Col. Peter Hicks, Defense Ministry spokesman at the barracks,
said part of the headquarters building was damaged in the predawn
blasts.
   He said sentries fired a number of shots, but they thought they
missed the two persons seen fleeing.
   There was no immediate indication of who planted the explosives.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army has frequently targeted
British military bases in its campaign to end British rule of
Northern Ireland and join the province with the neighboring Irish
Republic.
   The last IRA bombing in Britain was on Aug. 1, when one soldier
was killed and nine injured in a blast at Inglis barracks in north
London.
   It was the first fatal attack by the IRA on mainland Britain
since the bomb attack on the Grand Hotel in the resort of Brighton
in October 1984 during a conference of the governing Conservative
Party. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher escaped injury, but five
other people were killed.

   Five people died in two plane crashes in
the Adirondacks, a Civil Air Patrol official said, and witnesses
said the aircraft collided.
   The second of the two planes was found in a heavily wooded
section of northeastern New York late Sunday night about a
quarter-mile from the first, said patrol Lt. Lloyd Lininger.
   The first plane was found almost immediately after 4 p.m., when
it crashed, killing a passenger and critically injuring the pilot,
police said.
   The single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza, which had taken off minutes
earlier, crashed and burst into flames about a mile away from Warren
County Airport.
   The second plane, carrying four people, left the same airport
about 3 p.m. Sunday and was due back about an hour later, said
Washington County Sheriff Martin Wescott.
   Some witnesses, including other pilots, said they saw a
collision, officials said.
   The search for the second plane began when it did not return or
turn or at other area airports. Sheriff's deputies from Warren and
Washington counties, state police and civilian rescuers combed the
area until dark, then were aided by a Coast Guard helicopter whose
crew was equipped with night-vision goggles.
   Killed in the crash of the second plane were pilot Loughran
Boggs, 46, of Bolton Landing; James Wells, 16; Jackie Wells, 15; and
Rebecca Wells, 12, all of Queensbury. The relation between the
children was not clear, Lininger said.
   Police identified the victim in the first crash as Willard D.
Osterhout, 60, of Ballston Lake. The pilot and owner of the plane,
Peter Murray, 64, of Ballston suffered severe burns and head
injuries. He was in critical condition at Glens Falls Hospital
before being airlifted to Cornell Medical Center Hospital in New
York City Sunday night, said hospital spokeswoman Bonnie Unser.

   The dollar gained a tiny fraction against the
Japanese yen today, and leading stocks inched up to set another
record despite lackluster trading.
   The dollar closed at 125.75 yen, up 0.03 from Friday's close of
125.72 yen. It opened at 125.30 yen, its low for the day and closed
at its high for the day.
   Dealers said activity was slow in Tokyo because U.S. markets were
closed today for the Presidents' Day holiday.
   Tokyo also was showing little reaction to the announcement last
week that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $11.9 billion in
December from $12.2 billion the previous month, said a dealer with
the Bank of Tokyo.
   The figure was ``largely within expectations,'' the dealer added.
   Another dealer at a U.S. commercial bank in Tokyo said: ``The
dollar opened rather at a lower-than-expected level this morning,
but it gradually won back last week's closing level.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, an 89.91-point gainer on Friday, added another 3.69
points, or 0.01 percent, closing at 32,177.08.
   The index soared more than 100 points shortly after the start of
trading, but it fell back for lack of enthusiasm toward the end of
the morning session.
   Dealers said construction, securities and chemical issues were
gainers while airline shares declined.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co. shares, which have declined
steadily since the telecommunication utility was linked to a major
political scandal, lost another 40,000 yen, closing at 1,640,000.
   ``Uncertainty created by the scandal is making NTT shareholders
weary,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese brokerage. ``But I think
1.6 million yen is a decent bargain for shares like NTT.''
   NTT officials allegedly were among influential businessmen and
politicians who were offered bargain-priced shares of Recruit Co.
stock before public trading began and profited when the issues were
formally listed for sale and prices soared.

   David Ernest Duke insists he is not a racist,
but the ex-grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the
``Nazi of LSU'' has had a difficult time convincing his detractors.
   His successful campaign for a seat in the Louisiana House of
Representatives, representing a nearly all-white district in
suburban New Orleans, drew cries of outrage and dollars of support
from around the country.
   Republicans showed no alarm at his decision to join the GOP two
days before qualifying to run for the House seat until it looked
like he might win. The heavyweights _ President Bush and former
President Reagan _ endorsed his opponent, Metairie homebuilder John
Treen.
   Moments after Duke was narrowly elected Saturday, Republican
Chairman Lee Atwater moved to bar the man from the bearing the
party's name.
   It didn't matter to the jubilant state representative. ``Who does
he think he is? The people have spoken,'' Duke said.
   Duke, 38, started courting controversy early when he joined the
Ku Klux Klan as a teen-ager. In college, he was known as the ``Nazi
of LSU'' and was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform and carrying
sign that said, ``Gas the Chicago 7.''
   He sharpened his oratory at Louisiana State University's Free
Speech Alley, a public forum where he expressed his anti-black,
anti-Jewish views, and evolved during his 20s into an articulate
spokesman for the Ku Klux Klan.
   It was a new, unmasked Klan and he was the leader, engaged in
family activities, wearing salon haircuts and exhibiting
outspokenness about topics once the purview of hooded night riders.
   But in 1980, Duke split with Klan leader Bill Wilkinson, who
accused him of trying to sell secret membership lists. He started
his own organization, ``a white civil rights group'' called the
National Association for the Advancement of White People.
   Last week, he said he had some remorse about his time with the
KKK.
   ``I regret it ... because people might think I'm racially or
religiously intolerant,'' Duke said.
   And many believe he still is. Treen called the charismatic
candidate ``a master of deception'' who was ``spreading his Nazi
venom across the United States.''
   Duke ran for president in 1988 and didn't make a ripple on
election graphs. He tried first as a Democrat, a party which barred
him from their headquarters, and then made a move to the Populist
Party, hiring ex-American Nazi leader Ralph Forbes of Arkansas as
his campaign manager.
   His name was on 15 state ballots and he polled 48,000 votes,
about one-half of 1 percent of the nationwide tally.
   His bid for the state House started off much better. On Jan. 21,
he shocked observers by leading a seven-candidate field with 33
percent of the vote. Word spread quickly that Louisiana just might
send a man who once presided over cross burnings to its Legislature.
   As the international spotlight turned to Metairie, articles
connected to Duke reappeared _ such as the NAAWP News piece that
suggested dividing the United States into different countries for
citizens of certain ethnic backgrounds.
   Other past events were highlighted once more, such as the time in
1976 when Duke and a companion in blackface disrupted the unveiling
of a bust of P.B.S. Pinchback, a black man who served briefly as
governor of Louisiana during Reconstruction.
   British bobbies tried to oust him as an undesirable during a
visit to England in 1978, but he always seemed to outfox Scotland
Yard, showing up untouched for interviews and cross burnings.
   Duke has been arrested at least twice, once in Jefferson Parish
for inciting a riot in 1978 and once in 1987 during a demonstration
in Forsyth County, Ga. He was sentenced to six months in jail on the
Jefferson Parish case and received a suspended one-year sentence in
Georgia on condition he stay out of the state for a year.
   He used the record as a symbol of reverse discrimination, saying
blacks who demonstrate are called civil rights activists while
whites are called racists.

   Sirhan Sirhan, in his first television interview,
called Sen. Robert F. Kennedy his hero, but said he killed the
presidential candidate more than 20 years ago because he felt
betrayed by Kennedy's support for Israel.
   ``I was not doing it out of personal malice towards the man but
out of concern for other people,'' said Sirhan, who likened
Kennedy's assassination to a Jew killing Adolf Hitler. ``Robert
Kennedy represented a threat to Arabs by his support of the Arabs'
enemies.''
   Sirhan, 44, is serving a life sentence in state prison at
Soledad, Calif., and comes up for parole in May.
   The hourlong interview at the prison with David Frost for the
syndicated program ``Inside Edition'' was shown to reporters Sunday,
and is to be broadcast in segments tonight, Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Sirhan apologized repeatedly for killing Kennedy, then the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``He was my hero,'' Sirhan said. ``He was my champion. He was the
protector and the defender of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged.
I can't say anything except that I am totally sorry and feel nothing
but remorse for having caused that tragic death.''
   But when Kennedy gave a speech favoring the provision of U.S.
fighter jets to Israel, ``that seemed as though it were a
betrayal,'' said Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant. He said Kennedy
exercised a ``double standard'' by favoring peace in Vietnam and the
sale of arms to Israel at the same time.
   Sirhan said murder is not an accepted way to settle political
differences. But he added: ``Imagine if you were a German or a Jew
in Hitler's Germany and if you had the opportunity to assassinate
Hitler. I'm sure that you would have tried to do that.''
   Frost replied: ``There is no comparison between Hitler and
Kennedy.''
   Sirhan: ``Agreed, agreed. But the principle, in sorts, seems to
be similar.''
   Kennedy was shot in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June
5, 1968, moments after he claimed victory in California's Democratic
presidential primary. As he has before, Sirhan insisted that he
acted alone.
   Sirhan's death sentence was changed to life imprisonment when the
state Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty in 1972, and he
became eligible for parole in 1975. He has been turned down for
release nine times.
   After his last parole rejection, Sirhan said he believed the only
way he will leave prison is ``in a coffin.''
   In the interview, Sirhan said he had renewed hopes of release but
accused the California Board of Prison Terms of putting political
considerations before the law in denying him parole.
   Sirhan has given other interviews, but this was the first in
which he agreed to be recorded for broadcast, said the producers of
``Inside Edition.''

   A twin-engine plane believed to have 10 people
aboard disappeared on a flight from Las Vegas to Southern California
and search teams were focusing on an area around a 4,007-foot
mountain.
   The chartered Cessna 402 left Las Vegas at 11 a.m. Sunday and was
due at Orange County John Wayne Airport an hour and a half later,
said Civil Air Patrol Lt. Col. Ed Crankshaw.
   Two patrol ground teams searched late Sunday near Pleasants Peak
in the Santa Ana Mountains on the Orange-Riverside county line
because the plane disappeared from radar at about 2,100 feet near
the mountain, Crankshaw said.
   An aerial search was to begin at dawn.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, was trying to
determine whether the plane was missing or had landed somewhere,
said FAA regional duty officer Tommy Aina.
   Controllers talked to the pilot shortly after noon as the plane
was inbound to Orange County but there was no subsequent emergency
declaration from the pilot, Aina said.
   FAA duty officer Rich Tornquist said the pilot noted in a flight
plan that there were 10 people, but he cautioned that did not mean
all had boarded.
   Pleasants Peak is in the Cleveland National Forest, 45 miles
southeast of Los Angeles and 20 miles northeast of the Orange County
airport.

<UNK>Family of Four Shot to Death, Schoolmaster Hanged</UNK>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh gunmen burst into a Hindu family's
home and killed four people, police said today. Sikh militants have
been avenging the executions of two Sikhs for the slaying of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.
   In another Punjab town, a Sikh schoolmaster was found today
hanged to death from a tree, a news report said.
   There was no report of who was responsible.
   However, it was the 15th such hanging in the state since the
militants pledged revenge for the Jan. 6 executions of the two Sikhs
convicted in the 1984 assassination of India's leader.
   At least 292 people have been killed in the predominantly Sikh
state so far this year by radical Sikhs pressing their campaign for
an independent homeland.
   Five or six Sikhs with Chinese-made T-56 semi-automatic rifles
forced their way into Ram Prakash's house in the Punjab village of
Khara overnight and sprayed the room with bullets, said senior
police superintendent Sanjiv Gupta. Prakash, his wife, and two
teen-age sons were killed, Gupta said.
   The body of schoolmaster Surjan Singh was found hanging from a
tree in the town of Talwandi Rai, Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
   Sikhs, whose faith is rooted in both Hinduism and Islam,
outnumber Hindus in the northern state of Punjab, but they comprise
just 2 percent of the national population of 880 million.
   Hindus account for 82 percent of the national population.
   The Sikh separatist campaign began in 1982, and the death toll
has escalated each year. In 1988, at least 2,440 people were slain
by Sikh extremists in Punjab.
   The extremists attack Hindus and moderate Sikhs.

   Relatives of the people killed in
the bombing of Flight 103 banded together to push for a
congressional investigation and tighter airport security.
   ``By us coming together, we're going to try to prevent this from
happening to other families,'' said Bonnie O'Connor.
   O'Connor's brother, John Ahern, 26, of Rockville Center, N.Y.,
was aboard the Boeing 747 jumbo jet when it blew up Dec. 21 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 aboard and 11 people on the
ground.
   Seventy-five to 100 relatives _ many with photographs of lost
loved ones pinned to their chests _ attended a meeting Sunday in
this city 10 miles west of New York City at a restaurant owned by a
victim's relative. They formed the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103
committee.
   ``If we don't organize ourselves in an effective way ... it will
be very difficult to go forward,'' said Paul Hudson, an attorney and
former counsel to the New York State Crime Victims Compensation
Board who started the network of families. His daughter, Melina, 16,
was on the flight.
   ``We've come to assist each other in our grief,'' Hudson said.
   The committee will give support and aid to grieving relatives and
lobby for a congressional investigation of the bombing, said Bill
Ammerman, whose brother, Tom, died in the crash.
   Some committee members already have met with their lawmakers,
including U.S. Sens. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., Al D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
and Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
   Last week, officials announced that the terrorist's bomb that
destroyed the Boeing 747 jumbo jet had been traced to a portable
radio stored among the luggage.
   Airline security procedures are ``far less than what is required
to give confidence in the security of the system,'' Hudson said.
   The group will campaign for stronger security, including
installation of devices that detect plastic explosives like those
believed responsible for downing Flight 103.
   The relatives approved a resolution calling for the resignation
of Paul Bremer, U.S. ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, for
saying that flight crews and passengers do not need to know about
all bomb threats.
   Bremer told the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this
month that announcing all threats would encourage ``copycat
terrorist threats.''
   He also said the State Department will make sure any airline
travel warning issued to government employees about terrorist
threats also goes to the general public. Bremer said the American
embassy in Moscow violated policy in posting a warning about Pan
American flights eight days before the bombing of Flight 103.
   The committee also wants major international airlines to make
public their policies regarding bomb threats.
   Jane Davis of Shelton, Conn., whose daughter, Shannon, was aboard
the flight, said she agrees with the group's purpose but also wants
members to remember to make sure that any terrorists responsible for
the bombing are punished.
   ``I'm very much in search of justice, but not retribution,'' said
Mrs. Davis, whose daughter would have turned 20 on Sunday.

   Just days after anti-apartheid
leaders disowned Winnie Mandela over allegations her bodyguards
killed a young black, police raided her home, arrested four men and
reportedly found bloodstains.
   State-run Radio South Africa said the four men arrested in
Sunday's pre-dawn raid were bodyguards of the wife of jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   ``We have found fingerprints and blood samples which will be
sorted out in the laboratory,'' said Maj. Gen. Jaap Joubert, who is
leading the investigation into the murder of 14-year-old black
activist Stompie Seipei.
   He said police would try to prove in court that some young men
belonging to the so-called Mandela United Football Club, whose
members live at Mrs. Mandela's home and act as her bodyguards, had
assaulted the boy who died.
   Three Soweto men who are represented by an anti-apartheid
attorney have said club members abducted them and Seipei and beat
the four at the Mandela house. They claim Mrs. Mandela ``was
involved'' but have not elaborated.
   Mrs. Mandela declined to answer reporters' questions on the
police raid. She has suggested the whole case results from an effort
to discredit her.
   Speaking of the raid, Joubert said, ``This is a thorough search
of the premises where the alleged attacks and assaults took place,
according to witnesses.'' Seipei's body was found last month with a
slit throat, dumped in Soweto, the sprawling black township outside
Johannesburg.
   The scandal over Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards has seriously damaged
the credibility of a woman who had been at the forefront of the
fight to end white minority rule in South Africa.
   Her husband, jailed for 37 years, is the country's most revered
black nationalist leader.
   On Thursday, major anti-apartheid leaders repudiated Mrs. Mandela
because of her association with the soccer club. The president of
the exiled African National Congress also publicly criticized her.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, told a news conference Saturday that Mrs.
Mandela had decided to remove the bodyguards from her home at her
husband's instruction.
   Police released a videotape of their raid on the Mandela house.
It showed officers, without gloves, searching trunks of clothing,
leafing through photograph albums and collections of ANC literature,
and lifting up what appeared to be blood-soaked sneakers, a knife
and a pair of gardening shears.
   Authorities also removed clubs and whips.
   The camera focused on spots on the walls of rooms where the
detained men lived. Radio South Africa said the spots were
bloodstains.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, has denied being at home when the three men and
Seipei brought there. But she has defended their abduction and said
they probably were slapped to get them to talk about alleged
homosexual activities at the Methodist Church residence where they
lived. The church denies her allegations.
   Joubert said one of those detained during the 4 a.m. raid was
Jerry Richardson, identified as the club's coach. Others arrested at
the house were not named, but Radio South Africa said they were Mrs.
Mandela's bodyguards.
   The policeman said authorities also arrested two other men
elsewhere in Soweto, who will be charged with murdering Soweto's Dr.
Abu Baker Asvat. Community leaders have told newspapers that Asvat
examined Seipei after he was beaten. Mrs. Mandela said Asvat was a
witness to her charges of sexual abuse.
   Police also raided five other locations connected with Mrs.
Mandela, including the home of a free-lance journalist, Joubert
said. He did not identify the others.
   The alarm went off and dogs barked as policemen entered Mrs.
Mandela's property, according to the film. It shows Mrs. Mandela,
her daughter, Zindzi, and grandchildren in their bathrobes.
   Richardson was filmed in his underwear, putting on his pants and
shirt while a policeman asked him to identify men who ran away when
the raid started.
   State television broadcast those scenes from the film, which
police made available to foreign reporters the same day. They do not
usually release material so quickly.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has promised foreign
journalists he will release any information on the case as quickly
as possible, which also is unusual.
   The film showed Joubert directing the search while Mrs. Mandela
went about household chores, provided refreshments to journalists
waiting on the front lawn. She was heard chatting, laughing and
listening to Nat King Cole music.
   Police searched through Mrs. Mandela's belongings but did not
take any of them, said a journalist at the scene.
   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Raised British Warship Provides Rare Glimpse of Life of 1790s Sailors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BOWERS, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wreck of a British man o' war
hauled from the Delaware Bay almost 200 years after it sank is
providing archaeologists a rare glimpse of shipboard life in the
1790s.
   The find has shown that sailors were well-fed and enjoyed the use
of Wedgewood ceramic plates and good-quality muskets, said Charles
Fithian, curator of archaelogy for the Delaware Bureau of Museums
and Historic Sites.
   It also has revealed that the small two-masted fighting vessel
had machine-manufactured fittings, one of the earliest products of
the Industrial Revolution, he said.
   ``It's a whole chapter in maritime history,'' said archaeologist
Garry Stone, past president of the Society of Historical Archaeology
and special assistant for historic site development for the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
   The HMS DeBraak was lost in a sudden squall in 1798 in the mouth
of Delaware Bay and was quickly covered with mud, sealing the ship's
remains in an almost oxygen-free environment 90 feet below the
surface, Fithian said. A private salvage company raised the wreck in
1986.
   The 26,000 artifacts recovered show that ``by the 1790s, the
material world of the sailor had improved,'' Fithian said.
   A plethora of Wedgewood yellow ceramic plates indicate sailors
were issued mess kits and no longer relied on wooden bowls. And
despite contemporary accounts of bad food, the cuts of meat were
good and the seamen probably ate well, he said.
   Salvagers also recovered the largest known collection of men's
footwear and such leisure items as dominoes.
   Other items recovered include a sailor's brimmed knit cap _ only
the second one of its era known to exist _ a surgeon's tourniquet
screw used to stop bleeding, a tooth extractor and a black Wedgewood
teapot used during mourning.
   Rumors of gold bullion aboard lured treasure hunters for two
centuries, but only a few gold and silver coins were found.
   The DeBraak was a small, fast ship developed for the hit-and-run
fighting style of the 18th century. It was about 90 feet long and
weighed about 255 tons, Fithian said.
   The ship bears marks of the beginnings of assembly-line
production. The wooden discs, or shivs, in pulleys used to adjust
its sails were machine-manufactured, he said.
   Fithian said the ship was refitted from a Dutch merchant vessel
about two years before it sank and appears to have been giving
rigging and sails that were as much as two times too large for the
vessel. That might have left it top-heavy and led to its capsize, he
said.
   He said his theory ``ties really nicely to a letter Capt. (James)
Drew wrote saying he was having trouble sailing the ship.''
   While the findings have expanded knowledge of the era, experts
say salvagers damaged or destroyed many artifacts in raising the
vessel.
   James Delgado, chief maritime historian for the National Park
Service, said the loss of artifacts helped persuade Congress to pass
a shipwreck preservation law giving states jurisdiction over salvage
operations. He praised the work of state archaeologists in
preserving what was recovered.
   ``What these folks are trying to do is conserve one third of a
one-of-a-kind book of which two-thirds of the pages were torn out
and muddied and many of them were burned. No matter what...there is
no way the entire story of the DeBraak can be told,'' said Delgado.
   New Hampshire businessman L. John Davidson, whose SubSal Inc.
raised the wreck, defended the salvage effort.
   ``Sitting under the sand and continuing to rot is not the
answer,'' he said.
   Davidson said he plans to donate the artifacts and the hull to
the state for a museum if he can avoid tax on the gift. Under an
existing agreement, Delaware will receive only a sample of artifacts.

   A 10-year-old boy left partly paralyzed
after he was sucked to the bottom of a home whirlpool will get $4.95
million in an out-of-court settlement, attorneys say.
   The 1984 backyard accident at the family's rented home in the Los
Angeles suburb of Fountain Valley left Adam Walters with partly
paralyzed legs, speech problems and trouble using an arm. He now
uses a wheelchair.
   The homeowners and the rental agency agreed to the settlement
Friday to avoid a costly court fight but maintain they were
blameless, their attorneys said. The spa maker, Blue Haven, was in
bankruptcy and not part of the settlement.
   ``This gives Adam options for the future that he might not have
had _ to go to school, to have a career, to get the physical therapy
and medical help he needs,'' said Robyn Walters, the boy's mother.

<HEAD>Talks Resume, Sides Still Far Apart</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese government
and three guerrilla groups fighting it resumed peace talks today,
although the parties have said there is little hope for finding
common ground.
   The combatants gathered for the second day at the Hotel
Indonesia, where they were to be joined later by the foreign
ministers of their allies.
   Vietnam and its ally Laos are attending, along with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which backs the
resistance.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who is organizing the
talks, told reporters today he remained optimistic but not overly so.
   ``We all know there are still divergences'' of views, he said.
   Hun Sen, premier of the pro-Vietnamese government in Cambodia,
told the conference Sunday that preliminary sessions that ended
Saturday showed the Cambodian adversaries ``are still quite far
apart ... and we do not hope yet to reach an agreement now.''
   During those sessions, the Cambodian factions restated old
positions and clashed over key issues, including who would
administer postwar Cambodia during a general election: the
pro-Vietnamese government or a new coalition government including
the three guerrilla groups.
   Before the talks, the four Cambodian factions paid a courtesy
call on Indonesia's President Suharto today, and Alatas said Suharto
urged them to find a negotiated end to their 10-year-old jungle war.
   The war broke out when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and
ousted the communist Khmer Rouge regime.
   During the Khmer Rouge's four-year rule about 2 million
Cambodians died from executions, famine and civil unrest and the
Khmer Rouge attacked the Vietnamese border.
   The Indonesia discussions, tentatively scheduled to end Tuesday,
are the second round of multilateral talks.
   The first, in Indonesia last July, also was marked by clashes
among the Cambodians but produced a consensus that a Vietnamese
troop pullout must be linked to measures to prevent a Khmer Rouge
takeover.
   Indonesia is host to the talks as an official interlocutor on the
Cambodian issue for ASEAN, which groups Indonesia with Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Brunei.
   Hun Sen and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said
Sunday that since an accord among the Cambodians may prove elusive,
the negotiators instead should try to resolve what they called
``international'' aspects of the conflict, including a Vietnamese
pullout, an end to outside military aid to the guerrillas and
preventing a Khmer Rouge return to power.
   Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng of Singapore told the conference
it was dangerous to do that without an agreement among the Cambodian
combatants.
   ``Withdrawal without durable internal arrangements would only
lead to intensified resistance against a regime that was installed
as a result of external intervention,'' he said.
   Also today, Thach told a news conference that delay in finding a
settlement would only delay a Vietnamese troop pullout.
   He restated earlier pledges that Hanoi would withdraw its
remaining 50,000 troops by September if a political agreement were
reached among the Cambodian factions. If not, he said, withdrawal
would be delayed until December 1990.
   ``If others don't want an early solution, then we must be
prepared for the worst,'' he said.

<HEAD>Barge Accident Spills Gas Into Ohio River; Little Impact Seen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 40,000 gallons of gasoline spilled
in an Ohio River barge accident should dilute quickly in the
rain-swollen river without tainting water supplies or harming
wildlife, officials say.
   ``No impact has been observed thus far,'' said Rich Carter,
assistant chief of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's Office
of Emergency Response.
   Seven barges carrying gasoline from an Ashland Oil Inc. refinery
in Ashland, Ky., to a terminal on the Cincinnati waterfront broke
free from a tow Sunday morning and struck a railroad bridge piling
within view of downtown Cincinnati.
   Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum and the Coast Guard said two of
the barges leaked gasoline.
   The Ohio crested Saturday inches above flood stage and was
falling today. Carter said the swift flow prevented any recovery of
the gasoline but also should keep the spill from having much impact
on water supplies or aquatic life.
   The spill occurred downstream from intakes for Cincinnati's water
supply, officials said. Gasoline tends to float on the water's
surface, and authorities said water systems that draw from the river
could close their intakes until the spill floats past.
   Officials in Louisville, about 100 miles downstream, were
notified of the spill. Steve Samuels, production supervisor with the
Louisville Water Co., said carbon had been added to water at one
plant as a precaution to absorb any gasoline.
   Don Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management, said the spill should reach the
Louisville-New Albany, Ind., area by this evening if it doesn't
evaporate first.
   All other downstream communities close to the spill draw their
water from wells or underground aquifers, Carter said.
   The leaking barges were being drained of their remaining gasoline
Sunday night at an Ashland facility in Cincinnati and at a Standard
Oil Co. facility in nearby Bromley, Ky., Carter said.
   River traffic was flowing normally by afternoon, said Coast Guard
Lt. Chuck Polk. Investigators were trying to determine what caused
the barges to hit the Norfolk &amp; Southern Railroad bridge, he said.
   The bridge was not damaged, said Herb Nugent, terminal
trainmaster for Norfolk &amp; Southern.
   Sunday's spill briefly created an overpowering stench of gasoline
along the riverfront.
   ``It was nauseating. It would give you a headache,'' said Marian
Johnson of God's Shelterhouse, a Cincinnati home for the needy near
the riverfront.

<HEAD>College Presidents Use Trust Funds for Perks: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some college presidents are using state college
trust funds to pay for perquisites despite repeated scandals
involving abuse of the money, The Boston Globe reported today.
   Among the reported examples:
   _ Former Salem State College President James Amsler used college
funds to take his wife on a trip to New Orleans several years ago
and to pay for a class on Creole cooking she took while there.
   _ Robert A. Corrigan, former chancellor of the University of
Massachusetts in Boston, threw two Christmas parties in 1987 for
staff and university supporters at a total cost of $12,000.
   _ Massasoit Community College President Gerard F. Burke has a
$740 saltwater aquarium in his office paid for from his
discretionary trust fund. He also uses the fund to pay the $61
monthly fee to maintain it and replace dead fish.
   The trust funds are set up to receive money except that which is
appropriated to the colleges by the state. They include student
fees, receipts from college bookstores, parking lots and cafeterias,
and private and corporate donations, the newspaper said.
   College presidents have control over the funds and wide
discretion in how they are spent, as long as the use has some
connection to college activities.
   However, in the past two years the presidents of five of the
state's 29 colleges and universities have had to resign because of
violations involving state college trust funds, the Globe said.
   Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, the new chairman of the Board of
Regents of Higher Education, has made reform of the trust fund
system one of his top priorities.
   State Inspector General Joseph R. Barresi, whose office is
investigating trust fund abuses, has proposed legislation to rein in
what he called ``the disgraceful abuse of trust funds.''
   ``Administrators ... have been permitted to treat these funds,
raised from fees, practically as personal bank accounts,'' Barresi
told the newspaper.
   College presidents argue they need the trusts for programs and
activities not funded by the state, including experimental programs,
publicity and short-term grants to students in advance of
scholarship awards.
   ``Without the funds, we'd be handcuffed, totally dependent on the
amount the Legislature gives us, and that is too limiting,'' said
Andrew Scibelli, president of Springfield Technical Community
College.
   University of Massachusetts officials say that internal
accounting procedures are used to monitor accounts and that any
abuses there would be detected.

   A private U.S. cargo jet crashed
into a hillside in fog near the city's international airport, and
police said today that the bodies of two of the four dead American
crewmembers were recovered.
   A witness reported seeing a huge explosion in wooded hills 10
miles from Subang International Airport, where authorities said the
jumbo jet was headed with the crew and a cargo of clothing and mail.
   Officials said the cause of the Sunday morning crash of the
Flying Tigers Boeing 747 was not immediately known.
   Police recovered the jet's flight data recorder. Company,
Malaysian and U.S. investigators planned to investigate.
   Ann-Marie Hennessey, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles-based
Flying Tigers, said in a telephone interview that although it was
foggy at the time of the crash, the crew reported no problems to the
control tower.
   A police spokesman told reporters that two charred bodies had
been recovered _ one Sunday and one today. He said the search at the
wooded hillside continued for the other two bodies.
   Charles Tomson, Flying Tigers vice president for human resources,
identified the captain of the plane as Frank Helpin, 53, of Los
Angeles; First Officer Jack Robinson, 54, of Tucson, Ariz.; Second
Officer Ron Penton, 70, of Burlingame, Calif.; and maintenance
engineer Leonard Sulewski, 53, of Whitehouse, N.J.
   The airline's director of safety, Ken Ensslin, was on his way to
Kuala Lumpur with others from flight operations and maintenance
divisions to help in the investigation.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Meg Gillroy said officials from the
Federal Aviation Administration and the National Air Safety Board
would also take part.
   The Department of Civil Aviation's deputy director, Brig. Gen.
Omar Saman, said the flight recorders would be sent to the United
States or Britain for examination.
   Ms. Hennessey said the flight originated at John F. Kennedy
Airport in New York, and went on to Columbus, Ohio; Anchorage,
Alaska; Narita, Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.
   It was to leave Malaysia for Hong Kong. Aviation officials said
Flying Tigers operates three flights a week to Kuala Lumpur.

<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up slightly in modest European
trading today with the market subdued by the U.S. President's Day
holiday. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar would probably move in a
narrow range in the absence of strong guidance from U.S. December
trade figures released Friday. Dealers said the announcement of a
deficit close to market expectations had been seen as neutral.
   Some dealers said market attention was shifting to interest rates
in advance of testimony to the U.S. Congress by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   They said they believed Greenspan would call for a further
tightening of monetary policy to dampen inflation, but they did not
expect any statements to affect the dollar unless accompanied by
firm action such as raising the discount rate.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.03 yen to a closing 125.75. Later, in London, it
was quoted at a higher 126.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8375 West German marks, up from 1.8370
   _1.5630 Swiss francs, up from 1.5590
   _6.2595 French francs, up from 6.2550
   _2.0728 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0715
   _1,349.95 Italian lire, up from 1,343.87
   _1.1880 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1890
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7700, compared with
$1.7780 Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $382.10 a troy ounce, up
from $380.75 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $382.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $382.25, up from $380.00 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.35 an ounce today to close at
a bid $384.01, compared with Saturday's $382.66.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.96 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $5.93.

   Relatives of U.S. and British hostages in
Lebanon joined 100 people at a candlelight tribute honoring the
captives and appealing for their release.
   Seven relatives helped light candles for each of the 10 hostages
believed held in Lebanon at Calvary Missionary Church on Sunday
night. A photo of each of the hostages was displayed.
   ``Any time people band together for the hostages and make an
outward show of support for them, it's important to us. Because it
shows the United States government that they have a mandate from the
people to free the hostages,'' said John Anderson, the brother of
hostage Terry Anderson.
   The tribute, which featured religious and patriotic music, took
place on the first of two days of observances in this city 20 miles
northwest of Detroit.
   Today's scheduled activities include a news conference by the
relatives, a church luncheon, an elementary school assembly and
another tribute at a high school highlighted by speeches urging the
hostages' safe release, said Ernest May, chairman of the Second
Annual Tribute and Recognition.
   In addition to Anderson, whose brother is chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, Sunday night's tribute was
attended by Thomas Cicippio, brother of hostage Joseph Cicippio;
Estelle Ronneburg, mother of hostage Jesse Turner; Dorothy and John
Rose, mother- and father-in-law of hostage Alann Steen; and Elaine
and David Collett, wife and son of British hostage Alec Collett.
   Other Americans believed held hostage in Lebanon are Thomas
Sutherland, Frank Reed, Edward Tracy, Robert Pothill and U.S. Marine
Lt. Col. Richard Higgins.
   The observances were organized by May and Pontiac's Bicentennial
of the Constitution Committee.

   A soft spot for the Girl Scouts brought
actress Kathleen Turner here to help raise money for a Girl Scout
camp and to talk to nearly 3,000 girls about her filmmaking career.
   ``The older girls mainly wanted to know what it was like kissing
Michael Douglas'' in the movies ``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Jewel
of the Nile,'' Ms. Turner said. ``I told them `he's not bad.'''
   The chat with about 2,700 Girl Scouts took place Saturday at an
arena at Southwest Missouri State University.
   Later, Ms. Turner was the guest of honor at a dinner and
reception to benefit Girl Scout Camp Finbrooke. More than 300 people
attended.
   Ms. Turner, who attended Southwest Missouri State in the early
1970s, said she grew up with the Girl Scouts in the United States,
England and Venezuela. Her mother, Pat Turner, has been a Girl Scout
volunter since the 1960s and is chairman of a summer camp in
southwest Missouri.
   ``I think the Girl Scouts is a very important organization,'' the
actress said at the dinner. ``I have a daughter now, although she's
a little young and won't be starting Girl Scouts for some time.
   ``But I'd like the organization to be healthy and strong when she
is,'' Ms. Turner said.

<HEAD>Private Contractors Playing Bigger Role In Public School Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 75 second-graders in this
affluent community are learning Spanish the Berlitz way in a program
that shows how private contractors can play a role in public school
education, officials say.
   ``Here we had a full-blown developed program,'' said Tom Benson,
superintendent of schools in the northern New Jersey community of
Upper Saddle River. ``If you were to build a program yourself, it
would be exposed to criticism and flaws'' by the public and the
board of education.
   Upper Saddle River is the only district to contract with Berlitz
International Inc., but after-school and weekend services by
off-campus tutoring centers are growing rapidly, officials say.
   Private tutoring chains such as the Huntington Learning Centers
of Oradell, Kinder-Care Inc.'s Sylvan Learning subsidiary and
American Learning Corp. of Chicago also have staked claims
throughout New Jersey and the nation.
   The chains provide similar services. Classes of varying length
involve 5 to 12 students ranging from pre-school children to adults.
For monthly fees of $300 to $350, the centers enhance or overhaul
the skills of students in rudimentary math, reading and English,
officials say.
   Most centers also offer supplemental help like preparation for
the Scholastic Aptitude Test, officials say.
   ``(The cost) is not chicken feed, but for many parents we are a
last resort,'' said Ray Huntington, president and co-founder of the
Huntington Learning Centers. ``It's the industry of the '90s and
beyond.''
   The number of Huntington centers across the country has risen
from 15 in 1985 to 90. There are 11 centers in New Jersey, each
serving about 150 students a year, Huntington said.
   American Learning Corp. has 107 centers nationwide, up from 38
three years ago. There are six centers in New Jersey.
   The largest of the fast-growing tutoring centers is Sylvan, with
more than 260 overall and 16 in New Jersey.
   Alan Handler, executive director of the Sylvan Learning Center in
Teaneck, said New Jersey is fertile ground for tutoring services
because of its many affluent suburban communities and the pressure
to succeed in higher education.
   ``We're here to supplement what the schools do,'' Handler said,
emphasizing the individual attention the centers offer. ``A majority
of students can do a good job with a standard curriculum. Ten
percent do need extra instruction.''
   Paula Singer, vice president of marketing for American Learning,
said many parents turn to the centers to fine-tune their children's
skills.
   ``Parents want their kids to have a competitive edge,'' Ms.
Singer said. ``A lot of the New Jersey schools are very good, and we
do well in areas where schools are good. What you've got there is
community ... where they value education.''
   The new centers have drawn little reaction from teachers or
school officials.
   Public school teachers are aware of the private education growth
but see it as an adjunct, rather than replacement of their services,
said Robert Broderick, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education
Association, a teachers union.
   However, bringing a Berlitz instructor into a public school
classroom may disturb the ``spirit of community'' in schools created
by ties between regular teachers and students, Broderick said.
   Meanwhile, officials in Upper Saddle are hooked on Berlitz and
spent $30,000 this year for the company's language lessons, Benson
said.
   ``What (Berlitz) offers is the prestige and credibility of a
program,'' said Morris Corn, principal of the Reynolds school.
``They are really creating educational reform.''

<TEXT>
   Moderate Afghan rebels returned today
to try to settle deep differences with hard-line Moslem
fundamentalist colleagues after walking out of a session called to
name an interim government.
   The bitter divisions have kept the Pakistani-based guerrilla
groups from picking a temporary president, prime minister, and
Cabinet that they hope will soon replace their homeland's Marxist
government and usher in elections.
   Today's meetings at a religious compound on the outskirts of
Islamabad were held behind closed doors and there were conflicting
reports of their progress. Journalists were kept outside.
   Sources associated with the consultative council, or shura, said
participants still were divided along fundamentalist and moderate
lines.
   The Moslem guerrillas have been fighting Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed regime for a decade. The last Soviet troops left the
country Wednesday under a U.N.-brokered accord.
   The guerrillas and some Western diplomats believe the Afghan
government will soon fall without Soviet troops.
   The insurgents are fighting to establish an Islamic republic.
However, the fundamentalists want to establish a theocratic regime
along Iranian lines, while the moderates are more nationalist.
   The estimated 400 council delegates have failed during gatherings
over the past 10 days to agree on steps toward forming their own
post-war government or who would lead it.
   Iran-based Shiite Moslem guerrillas have boycotted the meeting in
a dispute over their proportional representation with the majority
Sunni Moslem fighters based in Pakistan.
   Delegates on Saturday nominated moderate leader Mohammad Nabi
Mohammadi as president and hardliner Ahmad Shah as prime minister.
   However, moderates said they walked out of Sunday's session for
confirming nominees because many hardliners insisted Ahmad Shah be
allowed to pick his own 35-member Cabinet.
   The divisions have prompted fears of further bloodshed in
war-ravaged Afghanistan. President Najib, who leads the government
in Kabul, says his forces can successfully battle the guerrillas.
   During the weekend, Najib declared a state of emergency, put
himself in charge of a new supreme military command, and
consolidated his power with a Cabinet reshuffle.
   Communist forces hold all Afghanistan's key cities, but the
guerrillas say they control nearly 90 percent of the countryside.

   A man visiting his girlfriend at a hospital
stabbed an apparent rival there, then chased the bleeding victim
twice around the orthopedic ward before the other man collapsed near
an elevator, police said.
   Javon Perry, 19, of Columbus was in critical but stable condition
today after emergency surgery following Sunday's violence at St.
Anthony Medical Center.
   Kendall Banks, 30, of Columbus was arrested on the hospital's
seventh floor and charged with felonious assault, police said.
   The stabbing followed an argument between the two men in the
woman's ninth-floor hospital room, said police Detective Robert
Locke.
   ``It was an argument over a girlfriend,'' he said.
   Banks pulled out a 3{-inch steak knife and stabbed Perry in the
neck, said hospital security officer Paul Parker.
   Perry ran out of the room, and Banks, still wielding the knife,
pursued him around the 32-bed orthopedic ward twice before Perry
collapsed, bleeding, near an elevator, Parker said.
   ``It was pretty bad,'' he said. ``There's no doubt that if it
would have happened out on the street, this man would not have made
it.''
   The officer said he pursued Banks and handcuffed him. Banks was
being held in the Franklin County Jail.
   The identity of the girlfriend and her reason for being in the
hospital were not released.

<HEAD>Japanese Police Arrest Two Executives for Exports to Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two executives of an air conditioner manufacturer
were arrested today for selling the Soviet Union a chemical used in
missile guidance systems, police said.
   Tsugio Uesaka and Yoshimichi Udagawa of Daikin Industries Ltd.
were arrested for forging export documents and selling nearly pure
halogenated hydrocarbon to the Soviet Union, police officials in
Osaka said
   Exports of the solution in concentrated form to communist
countries are prohibited under Japanese law and under an
international agreement regulating the sale of high-technology
products to Soviet bloc nations.
   Halogenated hydrocarbon, a compound commonly used in fire
extinguishers, can also be used as a coolant for guided missiles,
analysts say.
   Daikin, a major air conditioner maker based in Osaka, apologized
for the illegal exports but denied any responsibility for the sale,
saying the two executives had acted independently.
   ``It is regrettable that two employees of our company were
arrested,'' Daikin General Manager Tadashi Shibai told a news
conference. ``But I don't believe they were aware that they were
violating the law.''
   Police said the two executives approved exports of the chemical
solution with a purity of more than 99.8 percent to the Soviet Union
between February 1986 and May 1988.
   Uesaka, head of the company's inspection section, submitted
fraudulent export declarations which understated the product's
purity, police said. Government permission is not needed for exports
of the chemical with purity levels of less than 99.8 percent.
   Udagawa, head of the administration and planning section, and
Uesaka have not been formally charged. They were arrested for
violating the Foreign Exchange and Export Control Law.
   The company began exporting the high-grade chemical to the Soviet
Union in 1979 after receiving special permission from the
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control, an
international organization regulating the flow of high-technology
goods to communist bloc countries.
   However, it soon halted the exports when the international body
reinstated an export ban following the Soviet military intervention
in Afghanistan.
   In 1987, Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidairy of Toshiba Corp., was
charged with illegally exporting sophisticated computerized milling
equipment to the Soviet Union.
   The case created widespread public outrage in the United States.
The U.S. government subsequently imposed sanctions on the company,
including a three-year prohibition on exports to the United States.
   In April, two small Japanese trading firms were charged with
illegally exporting sophisticated digital testing equipment to
China, leading to the arrest of three company officials. The case is
still pending.

<TEXT>
   A series of explosions rocked a British army
barracks in western England before dawn today after two intruders
were spotted and soldiers were evacuated, officials said. The IRA
claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Col. Peter Hicks, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said one soldier
was slightly injured by flying glass when three blasts shook the
Ternhill barracks, blowing out a wall of one block and igniting
several fires.
   Thirty minutes earlier, a sentry had fired warning shots at two
intruders, but they escaped, said Hicks.
   Police said they are searching for a car stolen by a masked man
who broke into a nearby home about the time the bombs exploded.
   They described the suspect as in his early 20s, 5 feet 5 inches
tall, sallow of complexion and wearing a camouflage jacket.
   The barracks near Shrewsbury, about 160 miles northwest of
London, houses the crack 2nd Parachute Regiment. Its
colonel-in-chief is Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.
   The soldiers were scheduled to return to duty in Northern Ireland
later this week, said Press Association, the domestic British news
agency.
   Claiming responsibility in a statement issued to Dublin media,
the Irish Republican Army said: ``While Britain maintains its
colonial grip on the north of Ireland, the IRA will continue to
strike at those who oversee and implement British government policy
in our country.''
   Hicks said a quick-thinking sentry challenged two intruders, one
armed with a handgun, inside the camp's fence about a half hour
before the blasts.
   ``The sentry fired after them, but bearing in mind that it was
dark, they quickly disappeared from sight and we do not think either
was hit,'' he said.
   The guard ordered evacuation of the living quarters, where 50
soldiers were sleeping, before the explosions began, Hicks said.
   He said the guard found an abandoned shoulder bag in which the
intruders were thought to have carried the explosives.
   At dawn, nearby residents reported acrid smoke hanging over the
barracks. Flames had burned away the roof of one block.
   Security was ordered tightened at other British army bases as
bomb disposal experts arrived at the barracks to search for clues.
   A number of veterans of the 1982 Falklands war against Argentina
live at the barracks, but fewer men were asleep there than usual
because many were on weekend leave. No families live on the base.
   A police helicopter was searching the area for the intruders, who
were believed to have hijacked a car on the main road outside the
base, and police roadblocks were checking motorists in the vicinity.
   The parachutists have been an IRA target since the Bloody Sunday
shooting on Jan. 30, 1972 in which 14 people were fatally shot by
soldiers of the 1st Parachute Regiment during a civil rights march
in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second largest city.
   The last IRA bombing in Britain was on Aug. 1, 1988, when one
soldier was killed and nine injured in an early morning blast at
Inglis barracks in north London.
   It was the first fatal attack by the IRA in mainland Britain
since the bomb attack on the Grand Hotel in the south coast resort
of Brighton in October 1984, during a conference of the governing
Conservative Party.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher escaped injury but five other
people were killed in the assassination attempt.
   The IRA is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Two small planes apparently collided over
the Adirondacks, killing five people and critically injuring a
pilot, authorities said.
   The two planes were found Sunday about a quarter-mile from each
other in a logging area 60 miles north of Albany, according to Lt.
Col. Lloyd Lininger of the Civil Air Patrol.
   Civil Air Patrol Maj. Gary R. Picher said one witness, who lives
near the Warren County Airport, said he ``heard a loud noise, looked
up and saw one plane going one way and one plane going the other
way.''
   A single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza was discovered shortly after
it crashed at 4 p.m. The plane crashed minutes after taking off from
Warren County Airport, about a mile away from the crash site, police
said.
   A passenger, Willard D. Osterhout, 60, of Ballston Lake, died.
The pilot, Peter Murray, 64, of Ballston, who was also the owner of
the plane, suffered severe burns and head injuries.
   The second plane, a single-engine Stinson carrying four people,
left the same airport about 3 p.m. Sunday and was due back about an
hour later, said Lininger. That plane was found near midnight
Sunday, with no survivors.
   The victims were pilot Loughran Boggs, 46, and passenbers James
Wells, 16, Jackie Wells, 15, and Rebecca Wells, 12.
   Lininger said Federal Aviation Administration investigators are
expected to arrive today, but a resident, a motorist and two cross
country skiers reported seeing a collision.
   Lininger said the injured pilot did not say anything about
another plane, but did say he ``knew that something came through the
windshield.''
   Murray was in critical condition at Glens Falls Hospital before
being airlifted to Cornell Medical Center in New York City on Sunday
night, said Glens Falls Hospital spokeswoman Bonnie Unser. The New
York hospital would not give his condition today.

   Palestinians staged a general strike for a
second straight day today to protest the Israeli occupation, and
troops bulldozed or sealed four houses of West Bank Arabs accused of
throwing firebombs at Israelis.
   Also today, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left for Cairo for
meetings with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Arens will reportedly push for the
resumption of ties, severed by Moscow after the 1967 Middle East
war, and Israeli media quoted officials in Jerusalem as saying there
were indications relations might resume this year.
   The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, a group made up
mostly of Palestine Liberation Organization factions, called for a
three-day general strike. It was the longest strike since the
Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8, 1987.
   In a counter move, the army declared Nablus, the occupied West
Bank's largest city, a closed military area, and erected roadblocks
at the four entrances to stop motorists from entering.
   Inside Nablus, troops stopped dozens of Arab-owned cars,
confiscated the drivers' identity cards and ordered them to remove
outlawed Palestinian flags and PLO wall graffiti, an Arab reporter
said. Palestinians are subject to immediate arrest unless they carry
Israeli-issued identity cards.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded two
Palestinians during clashes in the Deir El Balah refugee camp, Arab
doctors said.
   In the West Bank city of Jenin, troops bulldozed the house of a
resident accused of throwing three firebombs at an Israeli army
vehicle, an army official said. The official did not know if anyone
was injured in the firebomb attack.
   The army also sealed three homes of suspected firebomb throwers,
one in the West Bank village of Hawwara and two in the village of
Dahiat al Barrad near Jerusalem, the official said.
   The United States has criticized house demolitions and sealings,
saying they violate the right to due process. Houses are usually
demolished or sealed before a suspect is charged.
   In another development, Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini,
considered a top PLO supporter in the occupied lands, made a
conciliatory gesture to Israel, saying a Palestinian state would not
need an army.
   ``What do armies do in this part of the world?'' the Jerusalem
Post quoted him as saying during a speech in Tel Aviv. ``Either they
take over the country in coups or they end up in the Knesset
(Israeli parliament) in other ways.''
   The PLO has argued a Palestinian state should have all attributes
of statehood, including an army. The Israeli government objects to
the formation of a Palestinian state, saying it would endanger the
security of the Jewish state.
   Husseini was released from Israeli detention last month after
spending 18 of the past 22 months in prison without a trial. Since
his release, he has met with several left-wing and liberal Israeli
legislators.

   President Najib further consolidated
his power today, as Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Sharq resigned
and Najib took control at the head of a new military council of
party stalwarts.
   Sharq, 63, was one of 10 members of the 28-man Cabinet who do not
belong to Najib's governing People's Democratic Party and had
remained in the Cabinet after a weekend shakeup in which Najib
replaced seven non-party ministers with members of his party's
Central Committee.
   Najib picked Sharq to be his prime minister last May in efforts
to portray his government as enjoying broader support.
   Government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Sharq
resigned for ``medical reasons.''
   One source, an official in both the government and the party,
said Sharq met Najib and agreed the president should head the
Cabinet during the state of emergency declared Saturday.
   The 20-member Supreme Military Council for the Defense of the
Homeland, which is also headed by Najib, met today to map strategy
to continue the battle against Moslem guerrillas.
   It consists of the most powerful Cabinet members, the party
Politburo, its Central Committee, and the military. one military
council member, Vice President Abdul Rahim Hatif, does not belong to
Najib's party.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said Sunday the military council
will coordinate economic and military activities. He said it will
not replace the Cabinet, but did not elaborate. It appears the
military council is the most powerful body in the government.
   Najib declared the state of emergency three days after the last
Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving his forces to fight
alone against U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow
his communist regime. The departure ended nine years of Soviet
military intervention.
   The guerrillas and some Western diplomats believe the government
in Kabul will fall without the help of Soviet troops.
   However, Pakistani-based guerrilla groups are bogged down in
efforts to resolve differences over power-sharing. They seek to name
an interim government to take over in Kabul.
   The emergency suspends or limits certain civil rights, such as
freedom of expression, privacy and public assembly. The 43-year-old
president, former head of the KHAD secret police, said it was needed
because of ``conspiracies'' and ``armed intervention from outside.''

   Shootings apparently caused by disputes
between gangs killed four people and wounded two others during the
weekend, authorities said.
   In Paramount, Jose Ramiro, 21, of Los Angeles was killed by
gunfire late Saturday night as he was standing in a restaurant
parking lot, deputies said. The shooting appeared to be
gang-related, authorities said.
   Meanwhile, a 16-year-old boy was arrested Saturday for
investigation of murder in the shooting death of Rick Wooten, 20, of
Los Angeles. The teen-ager and Wooten belonged to rival gangs,
deputies said.
   The teen-ager, whose name was withheld because he is a juvenile,
was walking with a girl Saturday afternoon when a car carrying
Wooten and two passengers pulled up alongside them, deputies said.
An argument erupted and Wooten was shot in the head.
   Two teen-agers were killed Friday.
   Roman Rico, 14, of Hawthorne was fatally shot Friday night as he
tripped and fell in a driveway while fleeing two pursuers, believed
to be members of a rival gang, sheriff's deputies said.
   In Arleta in the San Fernando Valley, a 17-year-old reputed gang
member was shot and killed as he drove out of a shopping center
parking lot. His assailant walked up to the car and opened fire,
police said.
   Two people were wounded in apparently gang-related incidents,
authorities said: an unidentified man shot and wounded early Sunday
in suburban Westchester, and a teen-ager from Downey who was shot
three times in the back and dumped early Saturday in the Whittier
Narrows Recreation Area.

   Former Klan leader David Duke, who won
election as a state representative even though President Bush and
former President Reagan endorsed his rival, denounces a threat to
banish him from the GOP as ``un-American.''
   Duke says blacks and Jews have nothing to fear from him. And he's
urging the Louisiana Legislature and the Republican Party to accept
that he has changed since his days as grand wizard of the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s.
   ``I repudiate any racial or religious intolerance. Any group _
racial or religious _ has nothing to fear from David Duke,'' Duke
told a news conference Sunday following his narrow victory over
homebuilder John Treen on Saturday.
   Still, Duke did not mince words on where he stands on civil
rights.
   ``I'm for getting the government out of our personal lives. I'm
not for any law for segregation or integration,'' he said. ``The
right not to associate is just as precious as the right to
associate.''
   Duke, 38, edged the 63-year-old Treen for the House seat from the
nearly all-white district in Metairie, a New Orleans suburb. Duke
got 8,459 votes, or 50.7 percent, and Treen 8,232, or 49.3 percent.
   Duke registered as a Republican two days before qualifying for
the race. After his stunning success in beating six other candidates
in the Jan. 21 primary, the national party sent three advisers to
help his opponent and persuaded Bush and Reagan to endorse Treen.
   U.S. senators, the governor and other community leaders of both
parties warned that a Duke victory would ruin the state's reputation
and harm already tenuous race relations. Jewish organizations
decried his candidacy, and the archbishop of New Orleans warned
voters to choose cautiously.
   Shortly after Duke was declared the winner Saturday night,
National Republican Chairman Lee Atwater denounced the outcome and
vowed to have him censured and barred from using the GOP name, an
unprecedented step.
   ``David Duke is not a Republican,'' Atwater said in a statement.
``He's a pretender, a charlatan and a political opportunist who is
looking for any organization he can find to try to legitimize his
views of racial and religious bigotry and intolerance.''
   Duke responded, ``Is he going to censure me for my past? How many
Republicans, how many Democrats have done controversial things in
the past? The actions of Mr. Atwater are really un-American.''
   Duke's election also was condemned by civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson. He called it a symptom of a national problem of racism that
``the entire nation has to deal with.''
   Several state lawmakers said they expect an attempt in the
Legislature to refuse to seat Duke by challenging his residency, but
he dismissed allegations that he hadn't resided in the district for
the required one year as ``frivolous.''
   It would be the first time the House has ever taken such action.
The Legislature convenes for a special tax session Wednesday.
   ``The political process must remain inviolate,'' Duke said. ``The
men and women of good will in the Legislature will not tolerate any
challenge of this nature.''
   ``It all depends on what the majority of the House wants to do,''
said House Speaker Jim Dimos of Monroe. ``Unless someone makes a
motion to disqualify him, then he will be sworn in. I know the
people in his district elected him by a small margin, but he still
was elected and has to be treated as a member.''
   Some legislators said they believe a challenge of Duke's
credentials will go nowhere.
   ``I expect there will be a movement,'' said Rep. Jim Donelon, a
Republican who represents an area near Duke's. ``I expect it will
fail. And I do not have enough information yet to say exactly what
my position will be.''
   Rep. Alphonse Jackson, a Shreveport member of the Black Caucus,
said he would have nothing to do with a challenge.
   ``If the people down there want him,'' Jackson said, ``they
deserve him.''

<DATELINE>SAN PABLO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alfred Furrer, who on Veterans Day
toasted his late friends as the last survivor of a World War I Last
Man's Club, has died at 97.
   Furrer, of Richmond, died Sunday in Brookside Hospital in San
Pablo of congestive heart failure. His death came one year after the
second-to-last club member, Victor Parachini, died at the age of 89.
   As the Last Man, Furrer inherited a bottle of champagne that had
a lable signed by the original members of the club that was formed
in 1932 by 32 veterans from the San Francisco Bay area. Like similar
clubs formed elsewhere, Furrer's Last Man's Club held annual parties.
   The club's original champagne had gone bad after all those years,
so Furrer toasted the other club members last Nov. 11 from a new
bottle.
   ``It's a privilege to be honord by people just for sticking
around all this time, but, you know, I had to bury a lot of people
along the way,'' he said at the time.
   ``I came through floods, fires, wars, and, my God ... you come
through it all, and I don't know if it's an honor or a sort of
curse.''
   A native of San Francisco, Furrer was 25 when he was drafted and
sent to France where he served with an ammunition unit.
   He ran a stationery store in Richmond, was a former president of
the Richmond Chamber of Commerce and was named Richmond's Man of the
Year in 1959.

<HEAD>Stop the Dragnet'' and Vote, Says Dole</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole says the
Senate should ``stop the dragnet'' for information about Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower and move ahead with his confirmation.
   Dole, a Kansas Republican, said he has seen nothing to disqualify
Tower for the post.
   ``I think we should stop checking every rumor. Unless there's
some criminal activity, let's get on with the vote,'' Dole said on
the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, another guest on
the program, promised a quick vote on the Tower nomination once it
leaves the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   But Mitchell, who said he had not read the FBI reports on Tower,
said allegations surrounding Tower's private life are ``an
appropriate subject of inquiry'' because of the importance of the
defense post.
   ``There is, I think, a legitimate concern particularly since,
given the advent of modern technology, a president, a secretary of
defense, a national security adviser could have as little as 20
minutes to react to the possibility of nuclear holocaust to bring
judgment to bear at any time,'' said Mitchell.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the armed services panel, has
said he plans to have a committee meeting on Tower by Wednesday and
that a vote could come by the end of the week.
   The House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee is
planning a closed hearing Wednesday to hear from two State
Department security officers who investigated alleged security
breaches in Geneva while Tower was a U.S. arms negotiator their in
1985 and 1986.
   Investigators with that committee questioned one of the security
officials, Berne M. Indahl, for seven hours on Sunday about his 1986
inquiry.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that
President Bush continues to stand by his nomination of Tower.
   Asked on the NBC-TV program, ``Meet the Press,'' whether he
considered Tower an appropriate nominee, Baker said:
   ``Yes I do. And I talked to the president yesterday, and I can
report to you that the president feels that way as well, strongly.''
   Much of the inquiry into Tower's fitness to become defense
secretary has centered on allegations surrounding the former
senator's drinking habits and his relationships with women.
   Dole, a longtime colleague of Tower's in the Senate, said he has
read the FBI report on rumors involving Tower's personal life and
``I've found nothing that would disqualify John Tower. I think it's
time to stop the dragnet.''
   ``The Pentagon is suffering because we don't have a secretary of
defense,'' said Dole.

<DATELINE>CATAWBA ISLAND, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard used two helicopters,
an air boat, ice skiffs and private pleasure boats to rescue 175
people stranded on a slab of ice in Lake Erie after it broke free
from shore.
   ``There wasn't a threat of danger as far as floating to Canada,
but there was as far as the ice breaking up,'' said James Rusnak, of
the Coast Guard's Marblehead station near Catawba Island, on Sunday.
``It was a real sunny day and it had rained the day before.''
   The mile-long, quarter-mile-wide stretch of ice cracked and
floated free Saturday of the shoreline off Catawba Island State
Park, where ice fishing is a popular sport.
   No one fell off the ice slab, which broke free about 55 miles
west of Cleveland and moved about a mile into the lake during the
three-hour rescue operation.
   The ice floe ``took off pretty fast,'' said Dave Matta, an ice
fishing guide from nearby Port Clinton, who said he jumped over a
6-inch gap to a secure piece of ice when he noticed the slab
cracking away from the shore.
   ``There were people kissing the state park when they hit shore,''
said Matta.
   Some of the stranded people were rescued individually in large
baskets suspended by cable from two Coast Guard helicopters, but a
sense of calm prevailed, Rusnak said.
   ``Some of them were stuffing fish into their pockets,'' he said.
   Despite the popularity of the spot with sportsmen, Coast Guard
personnel advise against ice fishing on Lake Erie anytime, he said.
   ``The Coast Guard's policy is the ice is never safe,'' Rusnak
said. ``There is always a crew on immediate standby.''
   Nonetheless, some 25 to 30 ice fishermen showed up Sunday, Seaman
Dave Spang, a spokesman at the Coast Guard station at Marblehead,
said today. He said he did not know if more anglers showed up this
morning.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet commentary printed in a
Czechoslovak newspaper today acknowledged for what was believed to
be the first time that the 1968 Kremlin-led invasion caused ``deep
disillusionment'' in Czechoslovakia.
   The appearance of the commentary in the Communist Party daily
Rude Pravo follows Premier Ladislav Adamec's visit last week to
Moscow.
   The commentary said that not all Czechoslovaks welcomed the
Soviet invasion in which Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops crushed the
``Prague Spring'' reforms, many of which were similar to economic
and social changes now embraced by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``Some people saw in this an important support in the struggle to
preserve the foundations of socialism,'' it said. ``In others, the
action created a state of shock.''
   ``This was later replaced by deep disillusionment, the feeling of
national dignity being trampled upon, leading among a part of these
people to anti-Soviet moods,'' said the commentary, reprinted from
the Soviet daily Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   The banned Czechoslovak writer Vaclav Havel and eight other
activists go on trial Tuesday on charges in connection with
demonstrations last month in Prague. Their detention has prompted
more than 2,000 cultural figures and scientists to sign petitions
calling for their release.
   The Soviet commentary did not refer to Havel or the protests, but
it traced intellectual disillusionment to the invasion.

   Conservative economist Carlos Manuel
Castillo has won elections that put him into next year's
presidential race as the candidate for President Oscar Arias'
governing National Liberation Party.
   With only 12 percent of votes counted Sunday night, engineer
Roland Araya, accepted defeat and congratulated Castillo.
   ``Our huge immediate obligation tonight is to strenghthen
liberalism,'' Castillo, 60, said in a victory speech.
   The electoral tribunal said that with 12 percent of ballots
counted Castillo was leading with 65 percent of votes.
   Arias is not permitted to support either candidate, and the
constitution prohibits a sitting president from running for
re-election.
   An estimated 350,000 people voted Sunday at 1,901 polling places
throughout this country of 3 million people. Only party members can
vote, but anyone can register, even on the day of the primary.
   Voting started quietly. Later people filled the streets, but
there were not the usual festivities associated with balloting in
Central America's most stable democracy.
   Many people are disenchanted after seven years of government by
the same party. Their biggest concerns are inflation, which reached
more than 25 percent last year, and 6 percent unemployment.
   Castillo wants to maintain the country's agricultural exports and
fight corruption, essentially continuing Arias' policies. He
previously has served as vice president, deputy in Congress and a
Cabinet minister.
   Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his plan to end Central
American wars, has been criticized at home for paying more attention
to international affairs than domestic problems. Many voters accuse
him of inept planning that has depressed the economy.
   Castillo twice has lost his party's nomination: to Luis Alberto
Monge, who became president in 1982, and to Arias in 1986.
   This was Araya's first presidential campaign. His more liberal
agenda called for diversification of exports and land reform to
increase agricultural production. Araya also has been a member of
Cabinet.
   Castillo faces Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, who won the
nomination of the opposition Social Christian Unity Party last
November.
   Ideological differences between the two major parties are slight.
   Elections are scheduled Feb. 4, 1990.

   Dissident Polish Roman Catholics, who
have been ousted from the church they occupied for nearly a week,
say they will continue their fight until they get ``some sort of
satisfaction.''
   Diocese officials closed St. Michael the Archangel Church until
further notice early Saturday after they summoned police to remove
about 80 parishioners who had occupied the church since Feb. 11.
   ``We've heard nothing from the bishop since Friday night,''
Halina Chmiel told about 100 protesters outside the closed church on
Sunday. ``The Franciscans have changed our pastors five times in 12
years. They're just making a mess out of the church.''
   ``We want to show the world that we'll fight until we get some
sort of satisfaction.''
   The dissidents have pressed for the Rev. Roman Palaszewski, a
popular Polish priest, to be retained and for the church pastor, the
Rev. John Bambol, to be replaced. Palaszewski is being transferred
back to Poland.
   The protesters charge that the current church leadership is
diluting the Polish traditions of the church, which is located in a
predominantly Hispanic neighborhood.
   Many protesters said Sunday they would like to resolve the issue
so they can resume worship services at St. Michael.
   ``We're sad because we want to go back to our church,'' said
Teresa Sawko, a parishioner for the last 25 years, and the wife of
one of two men who staged a three-day hunger strike at the church.
``We want to return to the church, but something has to happen.''
   The diocesan offices were closed Monday and Monsignor Nicholas V.
Grieco, spokesman for the diocese, could not be reached for comment
about when the church would reopen.
   The police action came hours after negotiations between church
authorities and the protesters ended in an emotional, shouting melee
in the church. The occupiers noisily rejected appeals to leave.
   The trespassing complaint was filed by the parish's five-member
board of directors.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
talked with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt today and scheduled
meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as Moscow deepened its
involvement in Middle East peacekeeping.
   The major topic is a Soviet blueprint for convening an
international conference on an Arab-Israeli peace settlement.
Shevardnadze disclosed it Saturday in Syria, the first stop in his
five-nation Middle East tour.
   He met privately for two hours with Mubarak at the presidential
office in Cairo and then they had lunch together. An interpreter was
present.
   Shevardnadze told reporters he gave Mubarak a message from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and an invitation for ``an official
and friendly visit'' to the Soviet Union.
   ``We had important and in-depth talks ... and on both regional
and international problems, there is no disagreement between the
Soviet and Egyptian positions,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze did not refer to the blueprint he unveiled in
Damascus.
   The Soviet foreign minister is to meet with Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens on Wednesday. Arens flew into an Egyptian
military base near Cairo today and was to meet Mubarak later in the
day.
   The Soviet envoy's tour bolsters his country's role in Middle
East peace efforts at a time when U.S. action is hampered by the
change of administrations.
   He arrived Sunday from Jordan, where he met King Hussein. There,
he said he hoped to persuade Israel to abandon its ``stubborn''
stand on regional peace when he meets Arens.
   He praised peace efforts by the PLO and Arabs and added, ``The
rest now awaits the Israeli position.''
   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday he would
wholeheartedly welcome direct peace talks with the Arabs under U.S.
and Soviet sponsorship. However, the Soviets insist on a role for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel views as a
terrorist group and says it will not meet.
   Shevardnadze said he also will meet in Cairo with PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat, a Soviet ally.
   ``I hope progress can be made in the Middle East problem, which
needs joint efforts by the (U.N) Security Council and other
concerned parties,'' he told reporters at Cairo airport Sunday night.
   Asked about resuming relations with Israel broken during the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, he said: ``First let us convene the conference,
and then there will be no problems on diplomatic issues.'' Restoring
relations is an Israeli condition for a Soviet role in peace talks.
   On Saturday, Shevardnadze outlined steps for the five Security
Council members _ Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the
United States _ to organize a conference, to include the PLO, within
six to nine months.
   But he told reporters ``no country can come up with a proposal
acceptable to all parties from the beginning.''
   Shevardnadze is to visit Iraq and Iran before returning home Feb.
27.
   He is the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Jordan and is
the first high-ranking Soviet official to visit Egypt in 15 years.
   President Anwar Sadat expelled Moscow's military advisers in
1972, and Egypt since has become Washington's closest Arab ally.

<HEAD>Palestinian Cleared Of Illegal Weapons Possession Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian sought by the United States
for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner was cleared today of
illegal weapons charges in connection with a handmade knife found in
his prison cell.
   A misdemeanor court acquitted Mohammed Rashid, 39, and returned
him to Korydallos prison, where he has been jailed since his arrest
in Piraeus in May.
   ``I had it (the knife) because I fear for my life. I also fear
they may extradite me to the United States,'' Rashid told reporters
in the courtroom.
   Prison guards found the handmade stiletto and a file in Rashid's
cell during a random search of his prison cell on Friday.
   ``I don't think the objects found in his cell could really be
used to harm anyone,'' prosecutor Zacharias Kokkinakis told the
court.
   The three-member panel of judges acted on the prosecutor's
suggestion and voted 2-1 in favor of acquitting Rashid.
   A bomb threat during the hearing forced authorities to evacuate
the courthouse, which was surrounded by dozens of police and
security officers armed with submachine guns. The court session
resumed after a one-hour break.
   Rashid is wanted by U.S. authorities on charges of planting a
bomb aboard a Pan Am jet over Hawaii. A teen-ager was killed and 15
people were injured in the blast.
   The Greek Supreme Court twice has delayed a decision on whether
to extradite Rashid. The case was further delayed last month when
three Supreme Court judges resigned after a terrorist group
responsible for killing a Supreme Court prosecutor threatened to act
against court officials if Rashid were extradited.

<HEAD>Group That Denies Existence Of Holocaust Forced to Change Site Of

<TEXT>
   A weekend convention of a group
that denies that 6 million Jews were killed by Nazis in World War II
was moved after a Jewish group pressured two hotels to cancel the
meeting.
   The Institute for Historical Review had planned a three-day
convention for 160 members at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa. After
that inn and another hotel canceled their reservations, they met in
a basement banquet room at the Old World Village Wedding Chapel in
Huntington Beach.
   ``It took some doing, a lot of fancy dancing,'' Tom Marcellus,
the conference organizer, said Sunday. ``The two other hotels
chickened out.''
   The owner of the wedding chapel, Josef Bischof, was unavailable
for comment Sunday night, said his wife, Delores.
   The conference was to conclude today.
   ``We're here to bring history into focus,'' Marcellus said.
``We're historians.''
   The chairman of the Jewish Defense League called institute
members ``neo-Nazis'' and pledged to follow the group wherever it
goes. On Sunday, the group stood vigil outside the Holiday Inn in
Costa Mesa, which decided against playing host to the convention
Friday, two days after the Red Lion Inn bowed out.
   ``We've covered every hotel in Orange County to tell them Nazism
will not be accepted here,'' chairman Irv Rubin said. ``We're not
going to be silent like we did years ago when 6 million Jews were
killed.''
   Officials at both hotels made the decisions to cancel the
conference arrangements after speaking with opponents of the
institute.
   ``It was in the best interest of everybody,'' said Dick
Hetherington, general manager of the Holiday Inn.

   Israeli tank fire wounded two Norwegian
officers serving with the United Nations peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon, a U.N. official said today.
   Both men are hospitalized and in stable condition, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said an Israeli tank fired at the officers Sunday night as
they patrolled on foot within their area of operations in the
foothills of Mount Hermon.
   The tank was inside Israel's self-designated security zone, which
overlaps areas policed by the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, said
the official.
   One of the Norwegians suffered a shrapnel wound in his left leg
and the other was hit in the chest, the official said. A Swedish
soldier patrolling with them was not injured. The official refused
to name the officers involved.
   Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren, the Swedish commander of U.N.
observers, protested the incident to the Israeli army, which
promised an investigation.
   The U.N. force is made up of 5,844 troops from France, Norway,
Sweden, Ireland, Finland, Ghana, Nepal, Fiji and Italy. It has been
stationed in south Lebanon since 1978.
   The Israelis established the security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 after withdrawing the bulk of their forces following a
three-year occupation of Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete called out the
National Guard to help staff the state General Hospital overnight
after union workers rejected an offer to settle a staffing dispute
and set up picket lines.
   James P. Benedict, the hospital administrator, said only 26 of a
normal shift of 78 licensed practical nurses and attendants showed
up for work at 7 a.m. today. They were augmented by 94 Guard troops.
   It was the second time in three weeks that the governor had
assigned Guard troops to help out at the hospital, which provides
long-term care to more than 400 patients, because of labor trouble.
   The state filed a request for a court order to halt the work
stoppage, but there was no immediate action on the request. Judge
Antonio S. Almeida met behind closed doors with both sides for more
than an hour. Lawyers said later that he granted the union's request
that it be given a day to prepare a defense.
   ``While as of yet no critical patient need has not been met and
no emergency that could not be addressed has occurred, there is a
critical need for Local 1350 members to return to work before an
individual patient has irreversible harm,'' the state's complaint
said.
   Seven of the Guard troops on duty today have nursing training;
the others are doing non-medical tasks such as feeding, washing and
dressing patients.
   ``They gave us the easier ones first to get us used to it,'' said
Sgt. Robin Trudel of Warwick as she fed an elderly patient.
   ``I think this is totally uncalled for,'' Connie Prior, 56, a
quadraplegic who has been at the hospital for two years, said of the
job action. ``Number one should be the patients.''
   Twelve patients needing intensive care, most on respirators, were
moved to other hospitals.
   A strike by state hospital workers would be illegal. The union
called today's job action merely a protest, but Benedict countered,
``Once you get those picket lines out there and they're keeping
people out, I call it a strike.''
   State police said a half-dozen troopers were called in to keep
hospital entrances open after picket lines were set up. There had
been no reports of violence and abut a dozen pickets were at the
hospital's main entrance at 7 a.m.
   Members of American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees Local 1350 are locked in a battle with the state over
staffing levels at the hospital. The union has about 1,300 members,
about of half of whom work at General Hospital.
   They voted by a 4-to-1 margin to reject a proposed
53-cent-an-hour raise in return for concessions on staffing,
including greater management leeway in transferring staffers from
ward to ward and reduction in overtime hours.
   Union President Joseph G. Fargnoli called the raise offer
``insulting,'' and the union claims several workers already have
been injured because of an increased workload.
   Negotiations broke down Friday, and no new talks were scheduled.
   Workers staged a four-day sickout that ended Jan. 31 only when
Guard troops also were ordered by DiPrete to help staff the wards.
   Benedict called today's action ``an abandonment of patients'' and
said it would result in disciplinary action. But one picket who
refused to give his name called Benedict's comment ``an intimidation
factor. We expected that.''

   Confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali
Hamadi said today he was one of two hooded hostage-takers who
appeared at a Beirut news conference during the 1985 hijacking of a
TWA jetliner.
   Hamadi, charged with air piracy and murder in the hijacking, made
the admission in court after officials watched a videotape of the
news conference.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were
held hostage for 17 days after TWA Flight 847 was hijacked and
diverted to Beirut June 14, 1985. The plane was seized after leaving
Athens en route to Rome.
   ``I was one of those wearing a hood. The other one wearing the
hood was my partner,'' Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, told the
court through an interpreter.
   U.S. and West German authorities have identified Hamadi's
accomplice as Hassan Ezzeddine, who remains at large.
   During the 1985 news conference, Hamadi's accomplice made a
rambling statement including demands for the release of 700 Arab
prisoners in Israeli detention.
   Hamadi did not talk during the news conference at a Beirut hotel.
   He admits his part in the hijacking, but denies he fired the shot
that killed Stethem.

   Prince Charles' spent his second and last
full day in Florida pretty much like his first: hobnobbing with
socialites, playing polo before thousands of royal-watchers and
raising money to help African wildlife.
   The heir to the British throne left Palm Beach International
Airport at 11:10 a.m. EST today for an official visit to the
Caribbean island of St. Lucia, an airport police spokesman said.
   On Sunday, the prince went to the Palm Beach Polo and Country
Club to play a match on behalf of Friends of Conservation, which
raises money to help African wildlife. He did essentially the same
thing in Vero Beach on Saturday.
   The prince, protected by a 150-member security detail, also
watched a display of animals by televison naturalist Jim Fowler for
the second day in a row.
   This time, however, a tawny eagle took off on an unscheduled
flight over the grandstand. A few minutes later, the bird of prey
was retrieved by her handler, Steve Hoddy of Silver Springs.
   Afterward, Charles lunched in a tent by the polo field with about
600 club members and members of Palm Beach society who paid $275 per
couple for the event. There was also an auction of donated items
including paintings, a French barging trip and an ebony-and-gold
necklace.
   The proceeds will benefit Friends of Conservation, founded by the
prince's friends, Geoffrey and Jorie Kent.
   No totals were available for the weekend's fund raising, but a
similar event last year raised about $85,000, said spokesman Mark
Shafir.
   Charles again played for the Windsor Park team. He didn't score,
but did manage an assist as the squad defeated Palm Beach 9-5.
   On Saturday, the prince scored a goal as Windsor Park won a 10-7
victory over a Greenwich, Conn., team to take the first annual
Prince of Wales Cup contest.
   This was Charles' fifth trip to Florida since 1980. This time, he
wasn't accompanied by his wife Diana or their two children.
   Almost 9,000 people turned up for the event on a sunny 80-degree
afternoon. Most paid $10 each for general admission seats.
   As she watched him through a pair of binoculars, Hilda Savage
fantasized about having the prince over for a visit.
   ``I think I would serve him wine. I wouldn't give him a Miller
Lite,'' she said. ``I wouldn't put him in the kitchen either. He'd
be in the living room.''

   The 1989 Wolf Foundation Prize in Agriculture
was awarded to two British researchers, the foundation said Monday.
   The $100,000 prize is to be shared by Dr. Peter M. Biggs and Dr.
Michael Elliott, both of the Agricultural and Food Research Council.
   Biggs, the retired Director of the Institute for Animal Health of
the A.F.R.C. at Huntingdon, was honored for his work in the field of
animal health, having established the use of genetic engineering and
biotechnology for the study of infectious diseases in animals.
   Elliott, currently associated with the University of California
at Berkeley, was cited for increasing the efficiency of crop
protection against insects and diseases while also reducing the side
effects of chemicals.
   They were selected for their ``distinguished contributions to
basic science and its successful translation into practice in the
fields of animal health and crop protection,'' the foundation said.
   President Chaim Herzog will present the prizes to this year's
recipients in May.
   The private Wolf Foundation grants six annual awards of $100,000
each in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, agriculture,
mathematics and the arts. Awards are announced separately.
   The $12 million foundation was established in 1975 by Dr. Ricardo
Wolf, a German-born chemist and diplomat who emigrated to Cuba and
in 1961 became Cuba's ambassador to Israel. He lived in Israel until
his death in 1981.

   The Louvre Museum closed Monday for five weeks while
workers put finishing touches on an $850 million expansion project
to be inaugurated March 30 by President Francois Mitterrand.
   When it reopens, visitors will enter the museum through a tall
glass pyramid soaring out of the courtyard and leading to a vast
underground lobby.
   There they will find ticket windows, shops, restaurants,
temporary exhibition spaces and an auditorium.
   Last year, 3.5 million people visited the Louvre, often finding
it difficult to navigate their way through the museum's miles of
poorly marked corridors and galleries. Even locating the entrance
was a challenge, as it was barely marked and sometimes hidden behind
construction materials.
   Officials say all that will change with the installation of new
electronic panels giving directions and other information on museum
activities.
   The Grand Louvre, as the renovation project is known, nearly
doubles the musuem's exhibition space.
   Ticket prices will increase slightly, from about $3.30 to about
$4.15.

said.
   According to Radio Moscow, two modules will be sent aloft later

   The station, which has been permanently manned for two years, was
home for a full year for cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov,
holders of the world's record for space endurance.
   Since the space station was launched in 1986, four Soviet crews

   During its three years in orbit, 26 manned and unmanned

<TEXT>
   Flood waters began to recede in parts of Kentucky and Tennessee,
but forecasts of more rain raised fears of additional flooding in
areas that spent the weekend drying out.
   ``It could be really bad for us,'' Cecil Whaley, operations
officer for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday
night.
   Whaley said about 130 people were still unable to return to their
homes Sunday in western Tennessee, where nearly 400 residents were
forced to evacuate when the Obion River spilled over its banks.
Flash flood watches were posted today for the area, which is
expected to receive an inch of rain tonight and Tuesday.
   In Kentucky, the Ohio River appeared to crest Sunday night at
Louisville, but it began to rain again this morning, and forecasts
of an additional 1 to 3 inches accumulation by Wednesday raised the
prospect of additional flooding.
   The Salt and Green rivers in central and western Kentucky are
high in some places and are backed up from the lower Ohio River,
``so another 2 inches in those basins could cause additional and
extended flooding,'' said Mike Murphy, a technician at the weather
service office in Louisville.
   Backwaters from the Ohio River forced the evacuation of about 100
people early Sunday at West Point in Hardin County, where the Salt
River empties into the Ohio, about 20 miles southwest of Louisville.
   The town of 1,570 had escaped flooding until then, but 42 houses
had to be evacuated, Mayor Gene Smith said.
   Elsewhere in Kentucky, much of the Bullitt County town of Lebanon
Junction remained flooded. Five miles to the southeast, waters
receded from U.S. 62, ending the isolation of the little Nelson
County town of Boston.
   At Lebanon Junction 40 miles south of Louisville, ``half the town
is blocked; half the town is under water,'' City Councilwoman
Dolores Lucas said Sunday. About 30 people remained in a shelter at
Lebanon Junction Elementary School, said Mrs. Lucas.
   Four straight days of heavy rain, beginning Feb. 12, triggered
widespread flooding over all but the eastern and southeastern
sections of the state.
   The highest recorded rainfall for the week was in the Grayson
County town of Caneyville, which got 11.79 inches _ equal to a
snowfall of 9{ feet.
   In western Tennessee, flood waters receded over the cold, dry
weekend, but officials said ``substantial rain'' predicted for
tonight and Tuesday could once again leave buildings swamped and
homeowners stranded.
   Whaley said the Corps of Engineers had reported Sunday afternoon
that the Obion River was beginning to recede, but that another inch
or so of rain could send the water back into the emptied houses in
Obion County and could cause additional flooding.
   Meteorologist George Quereau, with the National Weather Service
in Memphis, said the area can expect at least an inch of rain,
``possibly more.''
   While their neigbors to the west worried about more
precipitation, snow was a welcome sight over the weekend for the ski
resorts of eastern Tennessee. About 5 inches accumulated Friday
night on the Cumberland Plateau, while as much as 9 inches fell on
Mountain City in Johnson County and the higher elevations of
Sullivan County.
   ``The town is booked pretty well solid, since it's a three-day
holiday weekend,'' said Jim Ahrends, a salesman for the Ober
Gatlinburg Ski Resort.

<HEAD>Scientists Wonder If Radio Transmitters Are the Real Threat to Spotted
Owls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Are the spotted owls that live in the ancient
forest of the Northwest really endangered or are they being
victimized by the miniature radio transmitters that scientists use
to track their movements?
   Biologists now are debating that question as a result of
expectedly high ortality rate among young owls outfitted with radio
transmitters. The scientists are also trying to determine whether
the devices interfere with adult owls' ability to reproduce.
   Since the early 1980s, wildlife biologists have been strapping
transmitters weighing about 20 grams, or about as heavy as two
quarters, on the backs of both juvenile and adult owls.
   If the transmitters are harming the owls, then studies that
concluded the owls may be a threatened or endangered species could
be based on faulty data, said Hal Salwasser, deputy director of
wildlife and fisheries at the U.S. Forest Service.
   ``We are very much concerned,'' said Salwasser. ``Many scientists
believe we may have a problem.''
   Larry Irwin, a Corvallis, Ore., wildlife biologist who has done
spotted owl studies for the timber industry, said questions about
the effect of the transmitters on the birds amounted to a
``hypothesis that needs to be tested.''
   ``It's an iffy thing,'' said Irwin. ``There is no evidence to
show the owls have been affected by the transmitters, but it has
been shown in other birds.''
   The fate of the spotted owl has become a major flash point
between environmentalists, the timber industry, the Forest Service
and the federal Bureau of Land Management in the fight over
protecting the ancient forests of the Northwest.
   The owls nest only in old growth timber and environmentalists
have demanded that the ancient forests be protected to ensure the
survival of the birds.
   Timber interests warn that such a ban on logging threatens the
forest-products industry in the Northwest. The two sides are waging
a hotly contested court battle, with the Forest Service and BLM
caught in the middle.
   In 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refused to designate
the owl as a threatened or endangered species, a decision also being
challenged in court.
   Despite years of study, an aura of mystery still surrounds the
spotted owl.
   Salwasser said that roughly 2,500 breeding pairs of owls are
believed to inhabit forests stretching from California to the
British Columbia border.
   ``It's not a population on the edge of extinction, but they
aren't as numerous as robins,'' said Salwasser.
   Salwasser first raised Forest Service concerns about the effect
of the transmitters on the owls in a recent briefing for
congressional staff members from the Northwest.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Salwasser said the
agency plans additional studies of the owls this year using
transmitters that weigh only a third as much as those used
previously. The new transmitters will be attached to the owls' tail
feathers, rather than by the harness-like contraption used before.
   ``The new data might not turn things around, but it may show
things aren't as bleak as some people thought,'' said Salwasser.
   Regardless of what the new studies show, he added, the spotted
owl remains a ``rare species whose habitats are under pressure from
logging.''
   Not all scientists believe the transmitters are harmful.
   ``The Forest Service is wrong; that's my appraisal,'' said
Charles Meslow, a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist stationed at
Oregon State University.
   Meslow said the Salwasser was ``citing the company line'' in
raising questions about the transmitters' effect.
   ``The Forest Service desperately needs a better survival rate
than what we documented,'' said Meslow.
   While conceding that ``anytime you put anything on an animal it
doesn't help them survive,'' Meslow likened strapping the old
transmitters on an owl to placing a six-pound backpack on an
average-sized person.
   ``I believe that the vast majority of these transmitters are
properly applied and ... I don't think they affect mortality
rates,'' said Meslow.
   Meslow was involved in the Forest Service's 1982-85 study, during
which transmitters were placed on 48 juvenile owls. Thirty-seven
died in the first year.
   Meslow attributed the deaths to ``predations and starvation,''
not the transmitters. ``These were not unanticipated causes of
death,'' he said.

   China's leading newspaper, the People's Daily, hit
the stands Monday with a new look designed to shore up its flagging
circulation and better cover the news.
   ``Not bad for day one,'' said a retired official as he read the
paper in downtown Beijing. ``I guess you could say it's `glasnost'
with Chinese characteristics.''
   The official organ of the Communist Party has seen its
circulation fall 20 percent a year recently. Currently, 4 million
papers are printed a day, the most of any daily in China, but only 2
percent of subscribers are private citizens.
   In a front page letter to its readers, the paper said the change
would increase the amount and the timeliness of news.
   ``We also will work to reflect the opinion of the people and help
employ public opinion to bring our paper closer to the masses,
closer to life,'' it said.
   In the past, the paper has been filled with reports about
bureaucrats opening a meeting here and closing one there. Tidbits of
important information were often buried.
   Breaking news such as plane crashes and important government
decisions was either not reported or published late and with scant
details. The paper paid infinite attention to theoretical issues of
little import to everyday life.
   Many Chinese used to read the paper to gauge the latest shift in
the political wind. But as the society has become more concerned
with economic development than ideology, the paper's usefulness _
and its readership _ has diminished.
   Monday's editions differed from previous weeks, but only slightly.
   International news was displayed on page one. Several breaking
stories were reported with current details. An unusual report
appeared on the status of China's military draft. More photographs
lined the pages.
   ``They wouldn't have had this a while ago,'' said Kang Kexing,
pointing to a story about hundreds of fishermen illegaly trawling
for eels on the Yangtze River. ``Before, they'd only report it after
it ended.''
   A companion story asked the Agriculture Ministry for reaction.
``Telephone Interview By The Paper,'' read the headline.
   ``They seem to be showing off here,'' said Kang. ``Very pleased
with themselves for reporting this so soon.''
   Other readers pointed to a story on Salman Rushdie's apology to
Moslems angered by his book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``In the past, it seemed that the only international news we got
were things almost directly related to China,'' said one reader.
``This has nothing to do with China. That seems to be a change, and
a good one.''
   The changes are limited, however. The People's Daily, like all
China's papers and publications, remains run by a government very
concerned with what is read by its people.
   Newspaper officials interviewed Monday said they believed the
change would help the circulation which has dropped further since
January when the paper doubled in price to about 5{ cents.
   Readers on the street were less enthusiastic.
   ``There's no comparison between this and some of the other
papers,'' said Yang Gong, a 23-year-old university student.
   Indeed, the People's Daily is by far the stodgiest of the four
dailies with the highest circulation in China.
   The No. 2 paper, the Worker's Daily, although generally
conservative, occasionaly comes out in favor of greater power for
the state-run labor union. Next in line, the Legal Daily, often is
filled with lurid stories of murders and rapes.
   The No. 4 paper, China Youth News, is one of the most interesting
publications in China. Over the last seven months, it has written on
labor strife, prostitution, homosexuality and the uses of liquor for
bribery.
   ``The People's Daily was boring before and it's boring now,''
said Chen Daqin, a worker in his 20s as he peered against a glass
case holding Monday's editions on bustling Wangfujing Street.
``They've changed the soup but the prescription's the same.''

   In just over a week a 9-year-old can
collect $500 from her father for staying away from the tube for a
year.
   On March 1, Anna Baker should not only be richer, but smarter,
her father said. The fourth-grader reads at a much higher level now
that she's been off television for a year, said Burk Baker. ``Her
vocabulary has increased, too.''
   ``I read about a million books last summer,'' said Anna, who sold
her parents on the idea after learning of a similar offer from a
father in Eugene, Ore.
   ``As much TV as she watched, I didn't think it was possible to
quit,'' Baker said last week. ``But she turned it off that second
and never looked at it again. I never thought she'd do it or I'd
maybe said $200.''
   It wasn't easy ``when I knew there was a real good game on, like
the Saints or LSU. Or an Elvis movie,'' Anna said. ``I love Elvis
movies. I haven't seen most of them. I really want to see `GI
Blues,' but I have to wait until the year's up.''
   And what will Anna do once she has the $500 in hand?
   ``I'm going to put most of it in the bank, and I'm gong to spend
the rest of it,'' she said. ``I was going to buy a TV but my mamma
wouldn't let me.''

   From his Alfalfa-style cowlick to his
toes _ well below his high-water pants _ Hornby K. Fletcher is
everything a nerd should be.
   But he wouldn't change a thing, not even his plastic pocket
protector or his tape-reinforced horn-rimmed glasses.
   ``I'm just a happy nerd,'' whines Hornby.
   The ``entreprenerd'' should be _ he had a paid engagement to
crash a convention Monday at the Opryland Hotel.
   Hornby is the creation of Mike MacDonald, who founded Rent-a-Nerd
Inc. after being laid off as a computer programmer two years ago.
McDonald, 28, of suburban Chicago, charges $100 minimum for Hornby
appearances at parties and conventions.
   McDonald-Hornby will be paid about $500, plus airfare, for
showing up and acting goofy at the convention here of the National
Association for Campus Activities.
   ``C'mon,'' he insisted, ``even the most macho guy breaks down
around his wife or girlfriend and acts silly and sensitive. And
that's a big part of being a nerd.''
   One Hornby routine is to begin emptying his pockets in a search
for something, and then ask an unsuspecting bystander to hold the
things. ``When they have their hands full, I ask them for help,'' he
said.
   MacDonald has a degree in math, minored in physics and enjoys
computers.
   ``I was definitely a nerd, although I didn't actually look very
nerdy,'' he said. ``I don't think you have to dress and look nerdy
to be a nerd. My natural inquisitiveness and own brand of humor made
me enough of a nerd.''

   The state today failed to meet a federal
judge's deadline to reduce overcrowding at the intake center of the
Adult Correctional Institutions and risks fines of $50 per excess
inmate per day.
   There were 397 prisoners at the intake center this morning, said
Joseph A. DiNitto, assistant to Corrections Director John Moran.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond Pettine, responding to a complaint
from the American Civil Liberties Union, had set a limit of 250
prisoners at the intake center, where people are held while awaiting
trial. He has scheduled a March 13 hearing to levy any fines and
warned state officials at a Jan. 31 hearing that he would be ``very
hard-nosed about this.''
   Prison officials have expanded work-release facilities and
shuffled 409 prisoners since Wednesday in an effort to remove 135
already-sentenced inmates from the intake center, DiNitto said.
   He said state officials hoped Pettine would see that as a
good-faith move to comply with his order.
   ``We disagree,''said Steven Brown, executive director of the
Rhode Island ACLU chapter. ``We will be seeking implementation of
the sanctions. They're doing too little too late. The state was
aware of this overcrowding problem years ago.''
   Brown said the ACLU had sought a court order as early as 1986 to
prevent putting three inmates in a cell.
   ``It really wasn't until six months ago that the Department of
Corrrections began thinking about doing things,'' Brown said. ``The
state can't rely that it sat on its hands for so long.''
   Among other programs, legislation has been introduced to allow
home confinement of non-violent prisoners and for speedier bail
hearings.
   ``Even with what they're doing now, the Department of Corrections
rejected out of hand a number of proposals by the ACLU several
months ago to deal with overcrowding,'' Brown said.
   Those included weekend court so people arrested on minor crimes
would not have to spend a weekend at the intake center and bail
standards that would ensure speedier release.

   More than half the cars of a train
carrying explosives and other hazardous materials derailed today,
and about 100 people were evacuated although there was no apparent
imminent danger, officials said.
   And in North Dakota, some rural residents were evacuated today
when a train derailed and two cars leaked anhydrous ammonia vapor.
   At Manteca, in the San Joaquin Valley east of San Francisco, 48
cars derailed out of a train of more than 80 cars that was en route
from Houston to Oakland, said Southern Pacific spokesman Jim
Loveland.
   He said the cars carrying the hazardous materials did not derail.
No injuries were reported.
   The train included four cars loaded with Class A projectile
explosives, an empty chlorine tanker and a tanker containing
hydrocarbon residues, according to police Capt. Dennis Hoerth.
   He said he did not know exactly what type of explosives were
involved, only that the car was marked ``projectile explosives.''
   There was no fire, no leak and no apparent imminent danger,
Hoerth said, but police evacuated about 100 people from an area of
about four city blocks.
   ``We're just evacuating the area for safety reasons. Just in case
something happens,'' said Hoerth, who described the area as a
sparsely populated residential district.
   In east-central North Dakota, a Soo Line train derailed today in
a rural area near the town of Bordulac.
   Foster County Sheriff James Dunn said that there were two
30,000-gallon tank cars leaking anhydrous ammonia vapor. Initial
reports had indicated that one car was leaking.
   Residents downwind were evacuated. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   Dennis Stebner, manager of the Farmers Elevator Inc. about a
quarter mile from the derailment, said he heard a bang when the
train went off the track.
   ``I look up and it looked like they were plowing snow,'' he said.
``One of the cars tumbled out of there. ... You couldn't see through
the haze of the chemical but you could see cars tumbling in there.''
   Chuck Rydell, environmental engineer with the North Dakota Health
Department, said anhydrous ammonia, commonly used as fertilizer, is
carried in liquid form but turns to a vapor when it comes in contact
with air. The vapor can hurt people's eyes and respiratory system
before it dissipates, he said.

   The 12 EEC nations agreed today to
recall their ambassadors from Iran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's order that author Salman Rusdie be killed for writing a
novel consider blasphemous by many Moslems.
   Britain later announced it would withraw all its employees and
close its embassy in Tehran, the Iranian capital.
   The decision by the European Economic Community foreign ministers
came a day after the Iranian leader said Rushdie ``could not be
forgiven even if he repents'' for having written ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said EEC
nations also will hold off on sending any high-level delegations to
Iran and limit the freedom of movement of Iranian diplomats in
Europe to within 40 miles of where they are stationed.
   Rushdie, born in India to a Moslem family, is a British citizen
and lives in London.
   Genscher called the EEC action a sign of solidarity with Britain.
   ``But it is also a signal to assure the preservation of
civilization and human values, the preservation of freedom of speech
and expression,'' he told reporters.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said later that ``it
is no longer sensible to maintain a diplomatic presence in Tehran.''
He Britain's charge d'affaires and four other British Embassy
employees would leave Iran in the near future.
   Britain restored diplomatic ties with Iran in November following
a 17-month break.
   Moslems object to passages in Rushdie's novel such as a scene
where prostitutes adopt the names of the wives of the prophet
Mohammed.
   Rushdie, 41, has not been seen in public since Tuesday, when
Khomeini ordered that he and the publishers of ``The Satanic
Verses'' be put to death. A bounty of $5.2 million later was put on
Rushdie's head by other Iranian religious leaders.
   The novelist has apologized for the controversy his book has
stirred, Khomeini has declined to withdraw the death ``sentence.''

   The 12 Common Market nations today said they will recall their
ambassadors from Iran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order
that Salman Rushdie be killed for writing a novel many Moslems say
is blasphemous.
   The decision in Brussels by the European Economic Community came
a day after the Iranian leader spurned Rushdie's apology for
offending Moslems with his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Khomeini
renewed his ``execution'' order.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the EEC
nations also will require Iranian diplomats in Europe to stay within
40 miles of where they are stationed.
   He called the action by the EEC foreign ministers a sign of
solidarity with Britain, where Rushdie, an Indian-born Moslem, lives
and is now in hiding.
   ``But it is also a signal to assure the preservation of
civilization and human values, the preservation of freedom of speech
and expression,'' Genscher said.
   Late today, Britain announced it was closing its embassy in the
Iranian capital and withdrawing all the embassy employees. Britain
restored diplomatic relations with Iran last November following a
17-month break.
   Khomeini indicated Sunday that he will not retract his order that
Rushdie be killed. Iranian clerics have put a $5.2 million bounty on
Rushdie's head.
   Khomeini's decree also named Rushdie's publishers, and copies of
the novel have been removed from some bookstores' shelves in the
United States and Japan. Fearing attacks, some Western publishers
have decided not to print the book.
   In Washington on Sunday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
called the death threat ``intolerable'' and an obstacle to Iran
``rejoining the community of civilized nations.''
   In New York, Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor implied
that Catholics should shun the work because it offends Moslems, but
criticized the death threat. O'Connor said he had not read the book.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran had sought to defuse the crisis
over Khomeini's death decree by saying Friday that Rushdie's life
might be spared if he apologized and repented.
   In an apology issued Saturday, Rushdie said:
   ``I recognize that Moslems in many parts of the world are
genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I profoundly
regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere
followers of Islam.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said at one point
Saturday that the apology from the 41-year-old writer was probably
sufficient to warrant a pardon, but it later retracted the statement
as only the opinion of one of its writers.
   On Sunday, IRNA quoted Khomeini as saying: ``Even if Salman
Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time it is
incumbent on every Moslem to employ everything he's got, his life
and wealth, to send him to hell.''
   Khomeini said the ``imperialist foreign mass media are falsely
alleging that officials of the Islamic Republic said that if the
author of `The Satanic Verses' repents, the execution order against
him would be abolished. This is denied, 100 percent.''
   Neither Khomeini's statement nor IRNA in any of its reports
Sunday referred to Khamenei's suggestion of a reprieve, reflecting a
widening rift in the Iranian hierarchy over the affair and their
country's relations with the West.
   Pragmatists in Iran have been pursuing closer ties with the West
and help in rebuilding an economy wracked by its eight-year war with
Iraq.
   Canada decided Sunday to allow entry of the book after
determining it is not ``hate propaganda,'' said National Revenue
Minister Otto Jelinek. It had blocked imports of the book after
receiving a complaint from a Moslem group.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is banned in Iran, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather
than receiving it directly from Allah.
   Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey have
decided not to publish the book, and leading bookstore chains in the
United States have pulled it from their shelves.
   Japan's top two foreign book dealers announced today they will
stop selling the book for safety reasons until the furor dies down.
   In Yugoslavia, the leading Communist Party daily began printing
excerpts of ``The Satanic Verses'' in today's editions.
   The printing of the excerpts in the daily Borba comes on the same
day as the arrival of Khamenei on a three-day visit. It is the
Iranian president's first official trip to a European country.

<HEAD>Bush Making More Than Sentimental Trip Back to China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's visit to China is far more
than just a sentimental journey to his one-time diplomatic post, but
also evidence of the steadily expanding ties between the two world
powers.
   The visit comes as the two nations celebrate the 10th anniversary
of their formal diplomatic relationship. On Jan. 1, 1979, the United
States switched its recognition from the Nationalist Chinese in
exile on Taiwan to the Communists in Beijing.
   And while differences remain over matters as diverse as trade,
human rights and Taiwan, none are expected to loom so large as to
mar the presidential tour, China-watchers inside and outside the
government say.
   Bush said recently that the two-day visit, which follows a stop
in Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, ``stands on its own.''
   He cited the ``important strategic, commercial and cultural
relationship that we have with the Chinese _ the largest number of
people in the world (are) in that country.''
   The president also said that besides the strong bilateral
relationship the two countries have forged, he enjoys ``a personal
relationship'' with its leaders, dating from 1974, when he became
the first U.S. diplomatic envoy in Beijing.
   A State Department official, reviewing prospects for Bush's stop
in Beijing, said the trip comes as overall relations are considered
``good, if not very good.'' The official spoke on condition he not
be identified by name.
   One major sore point _ the Chinese sale of missiles to the
volatile Middle East _ has been smoothed over for a time. Former
Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci was ``very satisfied'' following
a visit last fall when he was assured the Chinese will act ``in a
responsible and prudent way,'' the official said.
   Only defensive military hardware is sold to the Chinese, and the
oficial said military exchanges are ``modest, but growing, and
entirely satisfactory.'' He said U.S. officials hope high-level
Chinese military officers will visit the United States in the near
future.
   The official said he wouldn't be surprised if the human rights
situation in Tibet were ``touched upon'' during the visit.
Demonstrations there continue to be violently suppressed amid
Tibetan resentment of the Chinese economic and political dominance.
   And with U.S.-Chinese trade booming, the Americans will try to
press ahead on a bilateral investment treaty. The treaty would
provide protection for U.S. investors in China, similar to those
enjoyed by Chinese investors in the United States.
   For their part, the Chinese also are expected to continue to seek
additional access to Western technology as a boost for their own
domestic development.
   At present, China is the United States' 13th largest trading
partner with two-way trade totaling $13.4 billion. The tables have
turned in recent years, and the Chinese now enjoy a $3.2 billion
trade surplus.
   Robert Scalapino, a director of the Institute for East Asian
Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, says he sees no
reason to believe that U.S.-Chinese relations will be
``fundamentally altered in the coming years of the Bush
administration, although some ups and downs may well take place.''
   ``At the same time, there is no reason to believe that the old
issues between the United States and the PRC will somehow be
miraculously removed,'' he said. ``Taiwan will continue to be a sore
point with Beijing.''
   Scalapino, in a brief prepared for the Asia Society, said the
United States continues to adhere to the agreements under which it
observes the one-China policy, that Taiwan is a part of China, and
pledges to reduce U.S. arms sales to Taiwan over time. But the
United States also retains its informal relations with the Taiwanese.
   ``The United States is unlikely to make any major changes in its
policies toward the PRC or Taiwan in the near future unless some
unexpected event occurs,'' Scalapino said. And the United States
``is not apt to accept an active role'' in bringing Beijing and
Taiwan to the negotiating table to discuss reunification, he added.
   Another important item for discussion will be the upcoming
Sino-Soviet summit, when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
visits Chinese leader Deng Xioping in May _ the first such session
in 30 years.
   Paul Kreisberg, a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment,
says ``it can't possibly be a matter of indifference to the
president that Mr. Gorbachev will be meeting with the Chinese
leaders in the next couple of months.
   ``From his point of view, and from the Chinese point of view,
it's valuable for them both to have the relationship reaffirmed,
before the Soviets and the Chinese move on to the next stage in
their relations,'' he said.

   The furor in Iran over Salman Rushdie's
``The Satanic Verses'' probably stems more from the Machiavellian
machinations between political rivals in the Tehran hierarchy than
from religious outrage.
   The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``death sentence'' against the
British author reflects an intensifying power struggle between
so-called pragmatists who seek better relations with the West and
fundamentalist hardliners.
   Behind the declaration, diplomats and analysts see the hand of
Moslem radicals led by the increasingly powerful interior minister,
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, and Intelligence Minister Mohammad Mohammadi
Rey-Shahri.
   Their aim is to undercut efforts by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani and his allies to shed Iran's image of a nation of
Islamic fanatics who sponsor terrorism and end its self-imposed
isolation by restoring relations with the rest of the world.
   The Rushdie affair has severely jolted Iran's relations with
Britain, a country the hardliners consider second only to the United
States as an enemy of their decade-old Islamic revolution.
   London, which restored relations with Iran only recently after a
diplomatic dispute, announced today it was closing its embassy in
Tehran. The other 11 nations of the European Economic Community
agreed to recall their ambassadors from Tehran because of Khomeini's
order.
   The timing of Khomeini's angry outburst last week over ``The
Satanic Verses'', first published in Britain in September, seems odd.
   The novel has inflamed Moslems around the world who think it
blasphemes Islam and has triggered Moslem protests in Saudi Arabia,
India and Pakistan. Yet it barely raised a ripple of outrage in
Iran, which considers itself the beacon of fundamentalism among the
world's estimated 800 million Moslems.
   Some analysts see Khomeini's dramatic call for Rushdie's head as
a bid to reassert himself as the preeminent leader in the Islamic
world following his humiliating acceptance in July of a
U.N.-sponsored truce in the war with Iraq.
   The 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch has admitted publicly
that his agreement _ at Rafsanjani's urging _ to end the grueling
Iran-Iraq conflict was ``more deadly than drinking poison.''
   Khomeini had turned the war into an Islamic crusade against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, one prong in his drive to export his
Islamic revolution through subversion and covert action.
   The cease-fire, after a string of Iranian defeats on the
battlefield, badly undermined the credibility of that campaign and
marked a major setback for hardliners like Mohtashemi.
   The explanation for Khomeini's death decree that diplomats and
analysts consider most likely is that it is an attempt to discredit
Rafsanjani, whose faction has been gaining the upper hand in the
power struggle in Tehran.
   Rafsanjani, while criticizing Rushdie's book, did not publicly
endorse the death sentence. His ally, President Ali Khamenei, sought
to defuse the tension by saying that if Rushdie publicly apologized,
the death sentence might be dropped.
   Rafsanjani, named acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armed
forces by Khomeini last June, holds several key political positions
and is considered the most powerful figure in Tehran after the aging
Khomeini.
   Convinced that Iran's isolation cost it dearly in the war with
Iraq and that it cannot afford to be at odds with the rest of the
world while it rebuilds, he has stressed that Tehran no longer seeks
to export its revolution by militant means.
   To the radicals, that is anathema and violates the principles of
the revolution.
   The clamor over Rushdie's book has the hallmarks of earlier
efforts by Rafsanjani's rivals to thwart his policies.
   In November 1986, hardliners leaked word of Rafsanjani's
clandestine dealings with the United States to trade hostages held
by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon for badly needed
military hardware.
   Rafsanjani wriggled out of that by admitting it in parliament,
plunging the Reagan administration into a major crisis and claiming
it as a political victory over ``the Great Satan.''
   Arab sources with some knowledge of later dealings by Iranian
moderates to free Western hostages in Lebanon have said that
hardliners like Mohtashemi, who has long had close links with the
kidnappers, has blocked efforts by the pragmatists to free the
captives and gain friends in the West.
   The radicals fear that the eventual outcome of Rafsanjani's
policy will be resuming relations with the United States, severed in
1979. For them, that would be the ultimate betrayal.
   The political infighting in Tehran was largely masked during the
war with Iraq in the interest of unity. But since the cease-fire it
has become more open as the rival factions jockey for position for
when Khomeini dies.
   Although on paper the succession has been settled by the
designation of Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri as Khomeini's heir,
Rafsanjani is clearly making a bid to become the real power in the
post-Khomeini era.

<HEAD>Reagan Doctor Thinks Power Should Have Been Transferred</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan's White House physician said
Monday he now believes that executive power should have been
transferred to then-Vice President George Bush after Reagan was shot
in 1981.
   Dr. Daniel Ruge said that in hindsight, the emergency provisions
of the 25th Amendment allowing for the transfer of authority should
have been invoked after the March 1981 assassination attempt.
   The doctor, now living in retirement in Denver, said ``I knew all
about'' the 25th Amendment, ``but it never occurred to me'' to
suggest to Reagan's aides that it be invoked.
   As White House physician, he kept a copy of the 25th Amendment in
his bag, Ruge said in a telephone interview from his home.
   But in the hours after Reagan was shot in the chest by John W.
Hinckley Jr. outside a Washington hotel on March 30, 1981, Ruge said
he was preoccupied with the president's condition.
   ``Any physician should be more interested in his patient,'' Ruge
said. ``I have no apologies to make.''
   At the time of the shooting, Bush was traveling in Texas. He
returned to Washington immediately.
   But testimony to a University of Virginia study commission, and
statements by officials who were present at the time, confirmed that
a general state of confusion existed at the White House after
Reagan's shooting.
   There was no clear attempt to address the question of
transferring power during the time that Reagan was undergoing
emergency surgery to remove a bullet from a lung, or in the several
days after when he was in a recovery room at The George Washington
University Medical Center.
   ``Somebody should have been looking after the store'' during that
period, Ruge said, but ``fortunately, everything went well. The
country moved forward.''
   The former White House physician's remarks were initially
reported in Monday's New York Times.
   The White House atmosphere in the hours immediately following
Reagan's shooting was dramatized by the now-famous statement by
then-Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., who proclaimed to
reporters: ``As of now, I am in control here, in the White House,
pending the return of the vice president.''
   Section 3 of the 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967, four years
after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, provides for a
temporary transfer of executive power to the vice president.
   The power remains with the vice president until the president
sends a letter to leaders of Congress certifying that he is ready to
resume authority.
   Fred Fielding, who was Reagan's chief White House counsel at the
time, could not be reached for comment Monday.
   Fielding, however, told the University of Virginia study
commission that, ``to be very frank with you, that day, when I
mentioned the 25th Amendment, I could see eyes glazing over in some
parts of the Cabinet. They didn't even know about the 25th
Amendment.''
   Reagan signed a letter to Capitol Hill leaders in 1985, at the
time of his colon cancer surgery, saying he was relinquishing power
to Bush during the time he was under general anesthesia.
   But White House officials did not actually invoke Section 3 of
the 25th Amendment on that occasion.
   In a New York Times interview shortly before his inauguration,
Bush said that ``it never occurred to me'' to discuss the 25th
Amendment with his campaign running mate, Dan Quayle, now the vice
president.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Steven Hart said Monday that a
book, ``Contingency Plan for Transfer of Presidential Authority,''
was compiled in the Reagan White House and has been ``updated'' by
the Bush administration. Hart declined to comment on its contents.
   But an administration official, discussing the subject on grounds
of anonymity, said that ``it lays out steps to be taken in the event
of an emergency transfer of authority,'' including letters
containing directions telling specified White House officials how to
proceed in such an emergency scenario.

   Uniformed and plainclothes police raided
a marketplace in western Hungary and made a baton charge against
Polish tourists selling their goods unlawfully, a daily newspaper
said Monday.
   The trade union newspaper Nepszava said the regional police
headquarters is investigating ``this shocking action.''
   It said the police attacked Feb. 3 in Varpalota, a mining town
100 miles southwest of Budapest, where a group of Polish tourists
were selling clothing, liquor and jewelry to locals for Hungarian
currency.
   The Polish sellers ``broke out in lamentation and wailing'' and
Hungarian witnesses, ``especially women, angry and some crying,
threw strong words at the policemen,'' Nepszava said.
   Such transactions are illegal in Soviet bloc countries and are
considered black-marketeering. Police usually confiscate the goods
and sometimes also fine those involved.
   Beating foreigners indulging in such operations is unheard of,
the newspaper said.

   Festival organizers set off a
3{-mile chain of firecrackers worth $18,330 Monday and claimed it
was a world record, the national Bernama news agency reported.
   Spectators in Johore Baharu watched 3,338,777 firecrackers
containing 1,468 pounds of gunpowder go up in smoke in the
Firecracker Firing Festival, the news agency said from the region
180 miles south of Kuala Lumpur.
   The festival was organized by the Tampoi branch of the Youth
Movement of Malaysia to mark the 15th day of the Chinese lunar new
year, Bernama said.
   Jackson Tim, the movement's chairman, said the group will try to
enter the feat in the Guinness Book of World Records.
   It lists the current world record at 2.47 miles, set in Macao on
June 27, 1987, using 2,788,000 firecrackers and 1,323 pounds of
gunpowder. The firing lasted 6 hours, 45 minutes.
   At Monday's festival, the firecrackers were draped in an unbroken
line around specially erected 10-foot high iron railings.

   About 32,000 police are in town to try to ensure
that Friday's state funeral for Emperor Hirohito is safe, and
residents are feeling the pressure.
   Police say the massive force is justified by radical groups and
the possibility that international terrorists might target one of
the many visiting heads of state, who will include President Bush.
   Most Tokyo residents appear to support the security effort, which
police say is part of the largest security operation every carried
out in Japan. But some have complained about what they consider
police excesses.
   ``The major issue regards police pulling cars over at random for
spot checks,'' said a volunteer with a ``human rights hot line'' set
up by several Christian, civic and legal groups to deal with
complaints involving funeral security.
   ``People are also unhappy with being stopped on the street to
answer questions and with police searches of their homes,'' said the
volunteer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the hot line has had more than 90 calls since Feb. 2.
   Police have searched an undisclosed number of homes and
apartments on or near the route the funeral procession will follow
through central Tokyo.
   ``Residents are asked to voluntarily cooperate with the officers
conducting the examination,'' said one ranking official of the
National Police Agency. ``If they refuse, we keep going back until
they change their mind.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most
residents have cooperated and that rarely are search warrants
necessary.
   However, it is a fear of rumors, not a sense of civic duty, that
often leads to cooperation, said an apartment-dweller whose
residence has been searched.
   ``When they come to your door, what can you say? If you tell them
to go away, all the neighbors will wonder what you have to hide,''
he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Security forces also have kept a close watch on the hundreds of
demonstrations held since Hirohito's death Jan. 7. About 100
protests are planned for Friday, police say.
   During a recent protest march, three ultra-leftist groups
scuffled several times with riot police. Although police reported no
serious injuries on either side, five radicals were taken into
custody.
   A suspect can be detained in Japan for up to 22 days without
being formally charged, and police often arrest people on charges of
unrelated crimes to extend the questioning period.
   Yoshihisa Fujiwara, one of the top leaders of the ultra-leftist
Chukaku-ha's, or Middle Core Faction, said 17 members of his group
have been held since Jan. 7.
   ``The police pay no attention to the law whatsoever,'' he said,
while acknowledging his group's threat to disrupt the funeral.
   Chukaku-ha has said it can build rocket-like projectiles that can
travel more than two miles.
   More than 13,700 people had participated in anti-monarchy
demonstrations by mid-February, and about 68 have been arrested,
police said.
   Opponents of the monarchy include Christian groups, leftists and
some Buddhists. Most argue that Hirohito led Japan into World War II
and failed to stop the oppressive actions of the militarist
government of the time.

<HEAD>Economists Fear Recession From Fed Moves To Fight Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite objections from President Bush, the
Federal Reserve Board has forced interest rates higher in an
inflation-fighting battle that some economists fear may wind up
pushing the country into a new recession.
   The Fed's credit tightening efforts have been blamed for sending
a variety of interest rates, including mortgage rates and banks'
prime lending rate, higher.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed officials
argue that the central bank has no choice but to move to dampen
demand in an effort to keep the aging recovery from over-heating.
   However, critics, including the new president, contend that the
Fed is overreacting to inflationary fears. Some analysts believe if
the central bank does not soon relent, it will topple the country
into an economic downturn.
   Greenspan will get a chance to respond to the critics Tuesday
when he presents his semi-annual report to Congress on monetary
policy.
   The testimony, before the Senate Banking Committee, will come
just one week after the Fed embarked on another round of
credit-tightening following a government report that showed
inflation at the wholesale level took an unexpectedly sharp jump in
January, rising at an annual rate of 12.7 percent.
   The Fed responded by pushing short-term interest rates higher
through a behind-the-scenes process that siphons off available bank
reserves. With the supply of money lower, the cost of that money _
interest rates _ increases.
   Banks on Feb. 10 hiked their prime lending rate, the benchmark
rate for many business and consumer loans, to 11 percent, the
highest the prime rate has been since the end of 1984. Mortgage
rates have been climbing as well, with fixed-rate mortgages now
averaging above 10.5 percent.
   The latest round of credit tightening comes at a sensitive time
for the new Bush administration. Higher interest rates boost the
cost to the government of bailing out insolvent savings and loan
associations, a cost already put at $126 billion over the next
decade.
   The higher rates will also undermine the new president's pledge
to lower the budget deficit without raising taxes because higher
rates raise the cost of government borrowing to finance the debt.
   The Fed launched its credit tightening last spring and has been
pushing rates higher, off and on, since that time.
   Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said that the early credit tightening was appropriate, but the
central bank now has gone too far and is running a high risk of
harming the economy.
   ``Federal Reserve policy at the moment is misguided,'' he said.
``If they keep it up, they could push us into a recession and that
will make us worse off and end up increasing the federal budget
deficit substantially.''
   However, other economists say the Fed really has no choice but to
keep tightening in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures, even
at the risk of a downturn in the economy.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the New York brokerage firm of
Merrill Lynch, said he expected the Fed would keep pushing interest
rates higher until summer.
   Steinberg said the economy would probably topple into a mild
recession in the second half of this year, caused in part by the Fed
tightening moves. He based this prediction in part on a belief that
many consumers will cut back on spending as they are forced to make
higher payments on adjustable rate home mortgages.
   Bush said last week he did not believe inflation was a sufficient
problem at present to warrant higher interest rates, but the
president tried to play down suggestions of a rift with Greenspan.
   ``Maybe we'll get into a fight down the road, but I don't think
it's at hand, and I don't think Greenspan and I are far apart,''
Bush told reporters.
   Steinberg said that Greenspan would probably be doing the
administration a favor by sending the country into a brief recession
early in Bush's first term.
   ``If you postpone the day of reckoning, it will still come and it
will be a lot harsher,'' he said. ``If inflation rises significantly
... then interest rates would have to go much higher and the
negative effects would be that much greater.''
   That is what occurred in the last downturn in 1981-82 when
then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker pushed the prime rate up
to a high of 21.5 percent and sent the country into its worse
recession since the Great Depression as the Fed struggled to contain
the country's steepest inflation since the Civil War.
   In addition to revealing the Fed's money growth targets for 1989,
Greenspan will also reveal the central bank's economic outlook for
the current year during his congressional testimony. That outlook is
expected to differ markedly from the Bush forecast.
   The administration hopes to reduce the budget deficit to $91.1
billion for fiscal 1990, down from an expected $163.3 billion
deficit in the current fiscal year.
   But those hopes are based on the assumption that the economy will
grow at a rapid 3.2 percent annual rate through 1990.
   While that would be down from the 3.8 percent increase in the
gross national product for 1988, the best in four years, it would be
still be well above growth levels that Greenspan and other Fed
officials have indicated are sustainable.
   The Fed has argued that much slower growth is needed so that
increases in demand can be accommodated by an economy already facing
tight labor markets and high factory operating rates.

   More than half the cars of a train
carrying explosives and other hazardous materials derailed today,
and up to 150 people were evacuated although there was no apparent
imminent danger, officials said.
   And in North Dakota, some rural residents were evacuated today
when a train derailed and two cars leaked anhydrous ammonia vapor.
   At Manteca, a San Joaquin Valley town of 25,000 east of San
Francisco, 48 cars derailed out of a train of more than 80 cars that
was en route from Houston to Oakland, said Southern Pacific
spokesman Jim Loveland. A broken rail caused the accident, he said.
   He said the cars carrying the hazardous materials did not derail
and would be removed later today. No injuries were reported.
   The train included four cars loaded with Class A projectile
explosives, an empty chlorine tanker and a tanker containing
hydrocarbon residues, according to police Capt. Dennis Hoerth.
   He said he did not know exactly what type of explosives were
involved, only that the car was marked ``projectile explosives.'' It
may have been military munitions, he said.
   There was no fire, no leak and no apparent imminent danger,
Hoerth said, but police evacuated about up to 150 people from an
area of about four city blocks.
   ``We're just evacuating the area for safety reasons. Just in case
something happens,'' said Hoerth, who described the area as a
sparsely populated residential district.
   In east-central North Dakota, a Soo Line train derailed today in
a rural area near the town of Bordulac.
   Foster County Sheriff James Dunn said that there were two
30,000-gallon tank cars leaking anhydrous ammonia vapor. Initial
reports had indicated that one car was leaking.
   Residents downwind were evacuated. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   Dennis Stebner, manager of the Farmers Elevator Inc. about a
quarter mile from the derailment, said he heard a bang when the
train went off the track.
   ``I look up and it looked like they were plowing snow,'' he said.
``One of the cars tumbled out of there. ... You couldn't see through
the haze of the chemical but you could see cars tumbling in there.''
   Chuck Rydell, environmental engineer with the North Dakota Health
Department, said anhydrous ammonia, commonly used as fertilizer, is
carried in liquid form but turns to a vapor when it comes in contact
with air. The vapor can hurt people's eyes and respiratory system
before it dissipates, he said.

   The IRA bombed a British army barracks in western
England early Monday, but most of the men had been evacuated before
the blasts and only one soldier was injured.
   A half-hour before the three explosions, a sentry spotted two
intruders and fired warning shots, then woke the sleeping soldiers
and told them to get out.
   Police set up roadblocks in the area of the Ternhill barracks
following the pre-dawn blasts and said two suspects observed by the
sentry were thought to be at large in a stolen car. They said they
were searching for a car taken by a masked man from a nearby home at
about the time of the bombing near Shrewsbury, 150 miles north of
London.
   The explosions shook nearby houses, started fires, blew out the
wall of one accommodation block and destroyed the roof of another at
the home of the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, said Col.
Peter Hicks, an army spokesman.
   It was the second IRA bombing in six months at a British Army
barracks in Britain. In the last attack in August, one soldier was
killed and nine others were injured at the Inglis barracks in north
London. Security was tightened at bases around the country.
   One of the 50 soldiers sleeping in the barracks at the time of
Monday's attack was injured slightly by flying glass. Most were away
on weekend leave.
   The battalion, part of the regiment whose colonel-in-chief is
Prince Charles, is to begin a tour of duty this week in Northern
Ireland, the domestic press agency Press Association said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, in a statement issued to
Dublin news media, claimed responsibility for the bombing and said
other attacks would follow unless the British left the province.
   ``While Britain maintains its colonial grip on the north of
Ireland, the IRA will continue to strike at those who oversee and
implement British government policy in our country,'' said the IRA,
which has made British soldiers a prime target in its fight to drive
the British out of the predominantly Protestant province and unite
it with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   Hicks said the sentry challenged two men inside the camp's
perimeter fence shortly after 3 a.m. One of the intruders produced a
handgun and they fled, he said.
   The sentry fired three warning shots, but it was believed he did
not hit them, Hicks said.
   The guard ordered the evacuation of the living quarters before
the explosions began about 3:30 a.m., he said.
   ``Security was good,'' said Hicks. ``It stopped what could have
been an horrendous incident.''
   Officials said security was ordered tightened at other bases
after the bombing.
   In Belfast, the trial of a man accused of killing three people at
a March 1988 IRA funeral began Monday in a security court without a
jury.
   The prosecution said the defendant, Michael Stone, replied,
``Brilliant'' when detectives told him he had killed at least two
people. Three people were killed and dozens injured in the cemetery
rampage.
   Also on Monday, the lawyer for the Rev. Patrick Ryan said the
Catholic priest, who is wanted in Britain on bombing charges, will
appear in court if necessary. On Sunday, there were news reports
that Ryan had gone abroad.
   Lawyer Elio Malacco told Independent Television News that Ryan
had gone to visit friends, although he did not say where, but would
return if he was called to do so.
   The refusal of the Belgian and Irish governments to extradite
Ryan to Britain drew the ire of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Law officers are considering whether he should face charges in an
Irish court.

   A criminal court Monday acquitted two men
of helping organize the 1969 bombing of a Milan bank that killed 16
people and injured 100.
   Nino Gimigliano, a lawyer representing Milan city government,
said he will appeal the acquittals of Stefano delle Chiaie and
Massimiliano Fachini.
   State prosecutors had asked the court to acquit Fachini for lack
of evidence. They did not say whether they would appeal the release
of delle Chiaie, for whom they had demanded life imprisonment.
   Nobody has been convicted in the bombing at Milan's Piazza
Fontana. It was the first major act of terrorism in postwar Italy
and ushered in 15 years of violence by leftist and right-wing
terrorists.
   Investigators believe neo-fascists bombed the bank.
   Fachini is serving a life sentence for involvement in the 1980
bombing of Bologna's train station that killed 85 people. Delle
Chiaie was acquitted in that trial.
   The Catanzaro court freed delle Chiaie from jail, where he has
been held since he was extradited to Italy from Venezuela in 1987
after being a fugitive for 15 years.

<HEAD>China Banning Imports of Cigarettes, Liquor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is banning cigarette and liquor imports this
year to save foreign currency and end abuses in its foreign trade
system, official reports said Monday.
   China Daily quoted Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Minister
Zheng Tuobin as also announcing a ban on reselling export licenses
and tightening controls on imports of all products that can be made
in China.
   Zheng said the ban on foreign cigarettes and liquors will apply
to all imports except those for special tourist businesses, the
newspaper said in its overseas edition. It did not say when the
restrictions take effect.
   Last year, the government prohibited sales of all foreign
cigarettes except those marketed by the state's China National
Tobacco Corp. However, the move did little to slow widespread
smuggling of foreign cigarettes into China.
   Private vendors openly hawk foreign brands on street corners, and
government enterprises have been accused of making large profits by
reselling duty-free cigarettes obtained outside the country.

   Arctic explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes left Monday on
a third attempt to walk unaided to the North Pole _ an adventure he
likened to ``climbing a horizontal Mount Everest without oxygen.''
   Fiennes, 45, flew to Montreal with partner Dr. Mike Stroud, 33,
to prepare their attempt to become the first to make the 425-mile
trek without dogs or other support.
   Last year they walked only 45 miles before bad weather forced
them back. In 1986, Fiennes walked 110 miles across the ice unaided.
   ``We are going again because we failed the first two times and we
didn't think, despite those failures, that it was necessarily
impossible,'' Fiennes told reporters.
   They will pull sledges carrying 400 pounds of equipment,
including food for 60 days.
   ``It's the last great expedition of a physical challenge which is
unsupported,'' he said. ``To do it without support is like a
horizontal Mount Everest without oxygen.''
   Fiennes, 45, and Stroud, 33, again will make camp at Ward Hunt
Island, the world's most northerly land point, and hope to set out
March 7.

   The wreckage of a plane believed to be
carrying 10 people from Las Vegas was found today in the mountains,
along with at least nine bodies, authorities said.
   The private, twin-engine plane, which reportedly carried a family
en route to Disneyland, crashed Sunday near the top of a brushy
ridge in the Santa Ana Mountains southeast of Los Angeles. It
appeared the aircraft had nearly cleared the ridgetop at about the
2,200-foot level at the time of the crash.
   Bob Tur, a reporter from radio station KNX-AM, said it looked
like the plane crashed with ``tremendous force,'' strewing debris
across a 100-yard area. It was Tur who first spotted the wreckage
while flying over the area in a helicopter.
   The Cessna 402 left Las Vegas at 11 a.m. Sunday and was due at
Orange County John Wayne Airport at 12:30 p.m., said Civil Air
Patrol Lt. Col. Ed Crankshaw. Air traffic controllers received no
distess calls from the plane.
   Riverside County sheriff's Lt. John Gillis said at least nine
bodies had been found by 40 searchers flown in by helicopter to the
scene.
   The plane's fuselage was twisted, broken into several pieces and
partly buried, Tur said, adding, ``the bodies and baggage were
ripped apart and scattered over the peak.''
   Federal Aviation Administration duty officer Rich Tornquist said
the pilot noted in a flight plan that there were 10 people, but he
cautioned that did not mean all had boarded.
   The identities of the people believed aboard the plane were
withheld pending notification of relatives, but all were reported to
be from Las Vegas, officials said.
   In Las Vegas, a spokesman for the Mormon Church, Don Christensen,
said Meto Police officer Mike Cranson, his wife and their two sons
and three daughters boarded a chartered flight in Las Vegas on
Sunday morning for a trip to Disneyland.
   ``We understand the plane never arrived,'' Christensen said.
Cranson was president of a church men's group and had been active in
youth work and scouting, he said.
   Reached at the family home, Sandra Mattson, Cranson's sister,
said the family was still awaiting word. ``We haven't heard
anything,'' she said, her voice breaking. ``We're hoping to know
something more in an hour.''
   At Las Vegas Flyers, the charter outfit that provided the plane,
employee Doug Mueller refused any comment today except to say the
company had been in business for 20 years.
   Four Civil Air Patrol ground teams searched through the night
near 4,000-foot Pleasants Peak in the Santa Anas on the
Orange-Riverside county line because the plane disappeared from
radar at about 2,100 feet near the peak, CAP Lt. Harriet Aceves said
today.
   The FAA checked local airports to see if the plane, painted white
with red and yellow trim, had landed elsewhere, but it was not
found, said Tornquist.
   Controllers talked to the pilot shortly after noon as the plane
was inbound to Orange County but there was no subsequent emergency
declaration from the pilot, officials said.
   The site of the crash is in the Cleveland National Forest, 45
miles southeast of Los Angeles and 20 miles northeast of the Orange
County airport.

<HEAD>GOP Pays Hefty Salaries to Political Pros in Bid to Capture House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans are shelling out an eye-catching $2
million or more for campaign salaries in an uphill drive to gain a
majority in the House, a move setting off tremors among lawmakers
who refused to raise their own $89,500 pay.
   A few Republicans ``have expressed their concern'' to House GOP
leader Bob Michel about the $250,000-a-year salary for political
consultant Edward Rollins, according to a spokeswoman.
   But Rollins' defenders fire back scornfully, reflecting
long-simmering tensions between senior, more moderate House
Republicans and younger conservatives who favor confrontation
tactics to end their 34-year-old minority status.
   ``We have been in the minority since 1954. We have acquired the
habits and strategies of a comfortable minority,'' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia.
   Complaints about Rollins' pay are a ``classic example of the
defeatist attitude that says, `Let's only pay enough to get a guy
who will keep us in the minority,''' said Gingrich.
   Rollins, who ran President Reagan's victorous 1984 campaign and
was at the helm of Jack Kemp's unsuccessful run for the White House
in 1988, is taking over as vice chairman at the National Republican
Congressional Committee next month. He is bringing with him a small
group of aides _ some with close ties to HUD Secretary Kemp _ at
hefty five-figure salaries.
   ``I feel I'm worth it and I hope to prove it to them,'' said
Rollins, who is severing his relationship with a Washington lobbying
firm but will keep two or three outside clients as part of his
four-year contract with the NRCC, which raises millions of dollars
annually.
   Rollins concedes his chances of producing a House GOP majority in
four years quite slim, but says he hopes to pave the way for
Republicans to take control later in the decade.
   Committee spokesman John Buckley concedes it was poor public
relations to have word of Rollins' $1 million, four-year contract
become known virtually the same day lawmakers were loudly voting
down a raise in their own pay.
   Rollins was hired after an extensive search in which Rep. Guy
Vander Jagt of Michigan, the committee chairman, and others kicked
around names including former White House Chief of Staff Ken
Duberstein and outgoing major league baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth. Michel's spokeswoman Johanna Schneider, said her boss
simply ``wants to make sure that the money's well spent.''
   But one senior GOP aide, said Michel has personal misgivings over
the arrangement, and believes it was ``definitely a COS-Kemp cadre
inspired thing.'' A group of junior Republicans, operating as the
Conservative Opportunity Society, has worked in recent years to
redefine the party in hopes ot gaining a majority, but not without
friction with Michel and others.
   This aide, speaking anonymously, said some lawmakers question
``whether the money is going to get you a majority,'' and also say
that Rollins and the team he is assembling has sparse experience in
congressional campaigns, as opposed to presidential politics.
   Rollins says, ``My goal (for 1992) is not a majority. My goal is
to be competitive in 218 districts (a majority of 435) and gain a
majority in the 90s. Republicans held 192 seats in the House
following former President Reagan's election in 1980, but now hold
174.
   Rollins said he intends to ``define a very clear message that's
different from the one Republicans have had.''
   ``We need to run better candidates and run more effective
campaigns,'' he added.
   He said Democratic congressional candidates have fared well
despite the election successes of Presidents Reagan and Bush by
making it appear to voters that they were all part of the same team
of government.
   ``What we have to do is very carefully peel them away from the
president,'' he said.
   Like the Democrats, Republicans also are planning an effort to
influence the congressional district reapportionment due to take
place after the 1990 census in hopes of picking up new seats
expected to be created in states such as Florida, Texas and
California.
   Rollins' team includes Ann Stanley, political director for former
Rep. Kemp's president campaign, and spokesman Buckley, another Kemp
campaign veteran. Both will receive salaries of $70,000 to $85,000 a
year and envision four-year commitments, Buckley said.
   Marc Nuttle, a senior aide in the Rev. Pat Robertson's
presidential campaign, is ``chief of staff for the transition,''
according to Buckley, and may very well stay.
   Joseph Gaylord, the previous executive director, has a $70,000
consultant's contract for one year.
   Rollins also is expected to hire several other aides with closer
ties to Bush.

<HEAD>Blacks to Boycott Shops in Right-Wing-Controlled Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks are planning a consumer
boycott and civil disobedience campaign to protest ``ultra-racist
policies'' in the mining town of Carletonville, black union members
said Monday.
   The protest campaign has been provoked by two related
developments: the reintroduction of hardline apartheid measures by
right-wing town councilors and the alleged beatings by white
vigilantes of blacks seen in the town after dark.
   Local affiliates of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the country's main black labor federation, said the protests were
planned at a community meeting Saturday in Khutsong, a black
township outside Carletonville.
   Carletonville, 45 miles southwest of Johannesburg, was one of
several dozen towns where the extreme-right Conservative Party took
power in local elections in October.
   The town council subsequently voted to resegregate local
facilities that had been opened to all races and to build a fence
around the town hall to keep blacks off the lawn.
   Last month, the council said it was studying the possibility of a
curfew barring blacks from Carletonville at night, but no action has
been taken yet.
   The trade union statement said the boycott, expected to begin
next week, was decided on ``to protest the ultra-racist policies of
the town council.''
   ``We resolve to defy aparthied laws imposed on us, to defend
ourselves against assaults by white conservatives in the town and on
the mines, to withdraw our buying power from white-owned businesses,
big and small,'' said a resolution adopted at the community meeting.
   Tentative plans were made at the meeting for a sit-in at the main
park in Carletonville, where ``whites-only'' signs recently were
erected.
   The union statement said black community leaders directed special
criticism at the Anglo American Corp., the country's largest mining
conglomerate, for allegedly continuing to deal with ``apartheid town
councils.''
   A black consumer boycott has been under way since before
Christmas in the industrial town of Boksburg, where the
Conservative-controlled council has resegregated parks and other
facilities. The National Party government of President P.W. Botha
has made no move to halt the boycott even though state-of-emergency
regulations prohibit the organization of such protests.
   The government, which has condemned the Conservative Party's
resegregation campaign, has been accused of hypocrisy because it has
made no move to repeal the law that allows blacks to be barred from
local facilities.

   Dan Rather has had some awkward times on and
off camera, but therapists contacted by TV Guide say not to worry _
the CBS anchorman is about as stable as anyone can expect.
   From the 1986 assault by thugs who cryptically demanded
``Kenneth, what's the frequency?'' to a six-minute absence from the
anchor desk because he was upset that a tennis match cut into news
time, Rather has raised a few eyebrows.
   Eccentricities such as signing off for a week with the word
``courage'' and his intense delivery have puzzled viewers and led
The Times of London to query, ``Is Dan Rather, bishop of the
nation's news business, losing his marbles?''
   Dr. Joyce Brothers said Rather's tendency to show his feelings is
probably genuine but that skeptics aren't used to seeing emotion on
a newscast.
   ``He's still living with the ghost of Walter Cronkite. ... Walter
is sacred,'' said David Turkat, a media psychologist from Atlanta.
``He's more than a father figure, he's a legend: How can anybody
live up to that?''
   Justin Frank, a Washington psychiatrist, sees Rather as a
temperamental racehorse who has been kept in the stable instead of
out on the track running down investigative stories. Once in a
while, Frank said, Rather just has to give the barn door a kick.
   Rather declined the magazine's offer to comment.

   A newspaper report that the Duchess of York is
expecting her second baby is ``all speculation,'' Buckingham Palace
said Monday.
   The Today newspaper said Monday that the 29-year-old wife of
Prince Andrew received a weekend visit from gynecologist Anthony
Kenney, who delivered her first baby, Princess Beatrice, on Aug. 8.
   ``Royal watchers are convinced that Mr. Kenney's visit ...
heralds a brother or sister for Beatrice,'' the newspaper said.
   Kenney's office refused to confirm the visit, and a palace
spokesman said: ``It's all speculation. We've got nothing to say.''
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, refused to comment on the
speculation when she attended a childrens' fashion show to raise
money for a drug and alcohol addiction center.

   A Boy Scout group says citizens shouldn't have to
face the rear end of an equestrian statue of George Washington, and
they want officials to order an about-face for the general.
   Washington and his steed _ who gaze at the ramps of Williamsburg
Bridge, subway tracks and a parking lot _ should look north into
Washington Plaza and the community, said Al Frantz, head of an
800-scout group in Brooklyn.
   The scouts last year helped city park rangers plant 500 tulips as
part of a $1 million project that restored the crumbling and
graffiti-covered plaza.
   The boys have ``adopted'' the square and think the 13-foot statue
``Valley Forge'' faces the wrong way. City Councilman Abraham Gerges
has asked the city to spend the $55,000 to turn the bronze statue by
Henry Merwin Shrady with a crane.
   ``It would not be on my list of top priorities, but it's coupled
with the group taking care of the park,'' Gerges said.
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said statues in the Northern
Hemisphere generally face south toward the sun and Washington is not
snubbing the community.
   And Adrian Benepe, head of the Parks Department's art and
antiquities section, noted that ``Valley Forge'' faces Valley Forge,
Pa.
   The monument was dedicated in 1906.

<HEAD>Amazon Tribes Join Against Dams that Would Flood Their Lands</HEAD>
<UNK>By PETER MUELLO ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Indians, painted for war and
representing tribes of the Amazon, began a historic effort Monday to
stop the government from building two hydroelectric dams that would
flood native lands.
   It is the first time diverse tribes from the vast Amazon rain
forest have joined in a political movement.
   ``We will bring Indian peoples together, to fight,'' said Chief
Sebirop of the Gaviao tribe. ``We will not accept the dams. Where
will we live? What will we eat?''
   He and the others oppose construction of the Kararao and
Babaquara dams on the Xingu River, a major Amazon tributary, which
would flood an estimated 3,000 square miles of rain forest and
displace 7,000 Indians.
   Thousands of pro-dam demonstrators in trucks, cars and on
horseback paraded through the streets of this remote jungle town
carrying signs reading ``The dams mean more jobs and more progress''
and ``Gringos leave us in peace.'' Airplanes with banners carrying
similar slogans buzzed overhead.
   Brazil has about 220,000 Indians in a total population of 144
million. Historians say the number has declined from about 5 million
when Portuguese explorers landed in 1500.
   Tribes along the Xingu face opposition from government and
industry, which say the power the dams would generate is vital to
economic growth.
   About 500 Indian men, women and children from more than 20 tribes
attended the opening session of the conference Monday at a brick
community center in this city of 38,000 people 2,000 miles northwest
of Rio de Janeiro.
   Included were 100 warriors from the Kayapo tribe, the main
organizer of the gathering. They ran into the center chanting,
wearing green-and-yellow feathered headdresses and daubed with red
and black war paint.
   They circled in a ritual dance, then put palm ronds on the
concrete floor and sat. Kayapo women carrying machetes, many with
young children, sat around the group.
   Whites predominated in the crowd packing the concrete bleachers
and the auditorium's balcony. They cheered and applauded as each
tribal delegation arrived.
   Brazilian and foreign environmentalists were among the onlookers.
Foreign organizations represented included the Environmental Defense
Fund, based in Washington, and Friends of the Earth, which has its
headquarters in London.
   Chiefs stepped onto a wooden platform in turn and spoke about the
dams.
   ``We want the goverment to rethink the dams, said Jorge Terena of
the Terena tribe. ``The land is sacred to us. It has the roots of
our culture and our ancestors. The electricity won't benefit
Indians, only whites and their industries.''
   David Yanomami of the primitive Yanomami tribe that recently won
a U.N. ``Global 500 '' award for defense of the environmental
defense, took the platform and declared: ``We will not accept the
dams. The river will rise. The fish will die. The game will move
away.''
   All the chiefs spoke in Portuguese, Brazil's national language,
sometimes with accents and imperfect grammar.
   Some Kayapos made a videotape of the meeting to replay for their
villages.
   The Indians invited President Jose Sarney and ranking Cabinet
ministers to the meeting, but the government sent Fernando Mesquita,
president of the Brazilian Environment Institute.
   Boos and whistles came from the crowd when Mesquita said: ``We
recognize that great indignities were committed against the Indian
people, but now it is a question of national awareness. We are here
to listen.''
   Sarney, who was out of the country Monday, has said he favors
protecting of Indians and the Amazon environment but does not want
foreigners telling him how.
   The government has temporarily shelved plans for the Babaquara

<HEAD>Hijacking Defendant Says Passenger's Death Was An Accident</HEAD>

   A 22-year-old Lebanese on trial for
the shooting death of a French passenger on a hijacked Air Afrique
jet told Switzerland's highest court Monday that the killing was an
accident.
   ``I did not want to kill anyone, I only wanted to liberate my
friends,'' Hussein Hariri said, referring to his demands for the
release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
   Hariri went on trial Monday on charges of murder, attempted
murder, hostage-taking and four lesser counts stemming from the July
24, 1987, hijacking. The DC-10, which carried 164 passengers, was
diverted to Geneva while en route from the Congolese capital of
Brazzaville to Paris.
   The defendant said passenger Xavier Beaulieu, 28, was shot when
he got out of his seat and made a threatening move.
   Chief Judge Jean-Jacques Leu noted that according to a forensic
expert, Beaulieu was shot in the head from behind from less than a
foot away. Beaulieu's head had been covered with a blanket, Leu said.
   ``Pretending that you killed him accidentally is an absurd
attitude,'' prosecutor Willy Heim told Hariri. ``It will turn
against you.''
   Hariri declined to confirm that he had been on a Hezbollah
mission at the time of the hijacking. He said he would not talk
about his ``private life and political activities.''
   ``What I did was by conviction,'' he said.
   Hezbollah is Lebanon's most militant Moslem faction. It is
considered an umbrella for the groups holding most of the 15 foreign
hostages in Lebanon. A Swiss Red Cross delegate was held captive for
a month in Lebanon late last year in an apparent attempt to win a
lenient sentence for Hariri. The Swiss said no concessions were made.
   Police carrying submachine guns guarded the Federal Criminal
Court, which only hears cases of particular gravity and last
convened six years ago. The court building was ringed by barbed wire
and nearby streets were closed to traffic.
   The bearded defendant, wearing an olive-colored jacket, insisted
on a court interpreter but frequently switched from Arabic to French.
   Hariri suggested the court had no standing to try him.
   ``I did not take any action against the Swiss,'' he said. ``This
was not a Swiss plane. There was no Swiss among the passengers. I
did not have any demands from the Swiss except refueling. That is
why I protest this judgment.''
   During the hijacking, authorities said Hariri threatened to blow
up the plane with TNT. However, he told the court the threat ``was
just words, I did not intend to explode it.''
   Asked by the chief judge to confirm that he paid the equivalent
of $6 to bypass security checks at Bangui, the capital of Central
Africa, where he boarded the plane, Hariri said: ``I do not know.''
   After seizing control of the plane over Italy, the hijacker
demanded to be flown to Beirut but agreed to stop in Geneva for
fuel. After the plane landed at Cointrin Airport, the hijacker shot
and killed Beaulieu and threatened to kill another Frenchman.
   Crew members subdued Hariri after a Congolese steward was shot
and seriously injured. Police stormed the plane when passengers
opened the emergency doors.

<HEAD>Talks Enter 3rd Week Without Progress on Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and the opposition reported
little progress Monday in talks on Poland's ailing economy, and one
official said the differences could delay an overall agreement.
   Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka, the party's senior official on
the economy, criticized the opposition for not being prepared to
discuss a five-point outline on the economy it had received Friday,
a government spokesman said.
   The comments came as the talks that began Feb. 6 between
authorities and the banned Solidarity union entered their third
week. The negotiations are aimed at reaching a new social contract
which would reinstate Solidarity and achieve national consensus on
economic and political reforms.
   Baka expressed concern that ``excessive delays'' in the working
group on the economy could hinder the progress of the talks as a
whole, the official PAP news agency said.
   The working group continued simply to exchange views, rather than
reach compromises, said Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz at
a news conference on the third session of the talks.
   ``It is a fact that progress seems to be slowest at the economic
table, but the situation there is definitely the most difficult
one,'' he said.
   In the case of political reforms and trade union freedoms _ the
topics of the two other main working groups _ the issues are easily
defined and the sides either agree or disagree, he said.
   But solving economic problems requires ``often finding a lesser
evil or such as solution that will advance the problem but won't
cause too great social tensions.''
   The government's five-point outline discussed improving market
supplies, curbing inflation, providing a social ``safety net'' for
people likely to suffer from upheavals in the economy, restructuring
state-owned industries and servicing Poland's $38 billion foreign
debt, the East bloc's largest.
   The official side presented the outline as a basis for
discussion, but government spokesman Zbyszek Rykowski said the
Solidarity team was unprepared for ``a serious discussion'' because
it wanted to discuss the outline among itself.
   ``I am afraid that this very formalized approach may delay the
work of our team and subsequently that of the round table as a
whole,'' Baka told PAP.
   The leader of the Solidarity delegation, Witold Trzeciakowski,
gave his personal view that the outline lacked details and that the
government has not addressed the opposition's request for creating a
social council that would supervise the implementation of economic
reforms, according to PAP.
   ``We think that the new Sejm (parliament) to be elected, which
will have participation of the opposition, will be the proper
constitutional forum'' for such a control, said Rykowski at a news
conference.
   So far the talks have yielded agreements in principle on how
Solidarity can be legalized and that the new parliament would have a
minority opposition representation.
   Onyszkiewicz said that in addition to the economic talks, several
stumbling blocks to overall agreement remain, particularly in
political reforms.
   He mentioned a government proposal Saturday to introduce into
Poland a strong presidency, which Solidarity considers unnecessary,
and officials' refusal in talks to guarantee the opposition access
to state radio and TV.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Monday the
confusing electoral system he ushered into law in December already
is in need of reform.
   Gorbachev made his comments in a visit to Kiev, the capital of
the Ukrainian republic. Activists there said several thousand people
had rallied and demanded that the republic's Communist Party leader,
a hold-over from the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev, be thrown out.
   ``Preparing for the elections, we are going through a very
important school of socialist democracy,'' Gorbachev on the first
day of his visit to Kiev.
   ``Of course, we haven't taken everthing into account yet. We will
review the results of the campaign, carry out the necessary
corrrections in order that our electoral law fully expresses the
will of every person and of society as a whole,'' Gorbachev said.
   His remarks, distributed by the official Tass news agency, did
not say what parts of the electoral law Gorbachev has concluded are
in need of reform.
   The law created a new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies
that will be elected for the first time in voting on March 26.
One-third of its members will be chosen not on the basis of
geographical districts, but by the Communist Party, its affiliates,
unions, social and political organizations.
   Some popular candidates like former Moscow party chief Boris N.
Yeltsin and human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov have been
nominated in many different electoral districts, complicating the
process. Sakharov has complained that the new system is not
democratic enough.
   The nominations made since the electorial campaign opened in
December have been set before local commissions that will decide
which names will be placed before voters.
   The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' devoted its first 25
minutes to a report on Gorbachev's arrival Monday in Kiev, the
capital of the second-largest Soviet republic that is run by
Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, 71, a hold-over from the Brezhnev era.
   There have been many reports since Gorbachev took power in March
1985 that Shcherbitsky was in trouble with the reform-minded
Gorbachev, but he has remained in power. The Ukraine has been
criticized at times for poor agricultural and industrial output.
   Shcherbitsky is the only remaining member of the ruling party
Politburo appointed under Brezhnev, whose 18 years in power now are
criticized as a period of economic and social stagnation as well as
rampant corruption.
   Yuri Mityunov, a Moscow activist involved in several informal
political movements, reported that several thousand people had
gathered in Kiev's October Revolution Square, demanding that neither
Shcherbitsky nor Kiev party boss Konstantin Masek be elected to the
congress.
   Mityunov said the demonstrations were organized by the People's
Movement, an organization similar to the People's Front movements
that have sprung up in many parts of the Soviet Union to push for
reforms and greater local autonomy. He said police did not interfere
with the protests.
   Shcherbitsky welcomed Gorbachev at the Kiev airport and
accompanied him on his initial visits in the city. There was no word
in the official media how long Gorbachev would stay.
   Characteristic for his frequent trips out of Moscow, Gorbachev
spent time chatting with local residents on a Kiev street and
highlighted a Soviet technological achievement.
   The ``Vremya'' report focused on Gorbachev's question-and-answer
session with a group of elderly and youth on a Kiev street.
   Tass said his comment on the electoral system were made in that
exchange, but it was not show on television.
   Gorbachev also was shown the new six-engine An-225 transport
plane. The jet, capable of lifting 250 tons of cargo, was flown past
Gorbachev at the Kiev airport and the manufacturers said it was
developed solely with Soviet-made equipment.
   That squares with Gorbachev's call for the Soviet Union to rely
on its own technical expertise wherever possible and to encourage
Soviet industry by putting forward examples of high-quality
Soviet-made products.

   A woman and two teen-agers trying to
collect an apparent drug debt forced a flaming blowtorch down a
woman's throat in front of her 8-year-old son, police said Monday.
   The 38-year-old woman was attacked Saturday night at her home and
was hospitalized in critical condition, said Lt. Stephen McCartney.
Doctors anesthetized her so they could put breathing tubes down her
throat, he said.
   Her name was not released because she also may have been sexually
assaulted by some of her assailants earlier in the week, McCartney
said.
   Lamont Smith, 17, and Renee White, 20, were arrested on charges
of assault with intent to commit murder, and a 16-year-old accused
of taking part in the attack was arraigned as a juvenile and ordered
held, McCartney said.
   At least some of the suspects had confronted the woman about the
debt earlier in the week and held her son out a second-floor window
by his feet while they may have attacked her, McCartney said.
   ``We have some suspicion that it's drug related,'' McCartney said.
   The woman apparently told her attackers she would pay on Friday
but then failed to, he said. Rescue squads found the woman dazed and
wandering, unable to talk and pointing to her throat, the lieutenant
said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mohammed Hassan Sharq
resigned Monday, broadening the power of President Najib.
   In Pakistan, meanwhile, Afghan scholars and Moslem guerrillas who
have vowed to topple Najib's government took on the task of
nominating an interim Afghan government when their top leaders could
not agree on the issue.
   Sharq, 63, had remained in Najib's 28-man Cabinet after a weekend
shakeup in which the president replaced seven of 10 non-Communist
Party ministers with members of his People's Democratic Party.
   Sharq was not a member of the party, but had been selected as
prime minister by Najib last May to portray his government as
enjoying broader support.
   A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Sharq met with
Najib and agreed the president should head the Cabinet during the
state of emergency that Najib declared Saturday.
   Also over the weekend, Najib created a new military council that
appeared to take over as the most powerful body in his government.
The 20-member Supreme Military Council for the Defense of the
Homeland met Monday to discuss the government's battle against the
guerrillas.
   It consists of the most powerful Cabinet members, the Communist
Party Politburo and Central Committee, and military leaders.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said Sunday the council will
coordinate economic and military activities. He said it will not
replace the Cabinet, but did not elaborate.
   The state of emergency suspends or limits freedom of expression,
privacy and public assembly. Najib said it was needed because of
``conspiracies'' and ``armed intervention from outside.''
   The last Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan on Wednesday,
ending the Red Army's nine-year intervention and leaving Najib's
forces alone in their fight against the U.S.-supported guerrillas.
   The guerrillas and some Western diplomats believe the government
in Kabul will fall without the help of Soviet troops.
   But the seven guerrilla groups based in Pakistan became bogged
down over the weekend in their attempts to form an interim
government for their takeover. Leaders have been divided along
fundamentalist and moderate lines over power sharing.
   Sources in Pakistan who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
leaders Monday dropped their nomination of hard-liner Ahmad Shah for
prime minister and appointed a commission of 70 field commanders,
Moslem clergymen and scholars to nominate a head of government and
cabinet.
   More than 400 delegates, including the guerrilla leaders, will
vote on the nominations at the meeting, being held at a religious
compound outside Islamabad, Pakistan.

   Members of Congress still smarting over the
$45,500 pay raise they had to forego may not want to read the
following:
   The average compensation of people running nearly 130
Washington-based trade associations, special interest groups and
labor unions is nearly $200,000, according to a survey by the
National Journal magazine.
   That's more than twice the $89,500 members of Congress get.
   Dr. James H. Sammons, executive vice president of the American
Medical Association, headed the ranks of well-heeled association
executives, pulling down $697,718 in 1987, according to the National
Journal.
   The next highest-paid executives were:
   Jack J. Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, $659,777; James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable
Television Association, $558,813; William McCollam Jr., president of
the Edison Electric Institute, $550,328; Jerome J. McGrath, former
president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America,
$424,783; Robert O. Aders, president of the Food Marketing
Institute, $405,882; Robert E. Vagley, president of the American
Insurance Association, $398,107, and Richard L. Lesher, president of
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, $392,226.
   At the bottom end of the pay scale were consumer and public
interest groups, with Consumer Federation of America executive
director Stephen Brobeck, who made $38,147. Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, made $40,000, and James D. Davidson,
chairman of the National Taxpayers Union, received $44,563.
   The figures represented all salary, benefits and expense
allowances reported to the Internal Revenue Service or, for labor
unions, to the labor Department, for 1987.
   A public uproar recently forced Congress to vote down a
presidential pay commission's plan to raise the lawmakers' salaries
to $135,000. The salaries of federal judges and top government
executives would have gone up in tandem with the lawmakers' pay.
   The salary information came from documents the groups file
annually with the IRS as a condition of their tax-exempt status.
Under a 1987 law, tax-exempt groups must make the documents
available for public inspection.
   Other highly paid executives were:
   William O'Connell, former president of the U.S. League of Savings
Association, $300,000; George W. Koch, president of the Grocery
Manufacturers of America, $327,313; Donald G. Ogilvie, president of
the American Bankers Association, $375,000; Richard S. Schweiker,
president of the American Council of Life Insurance, $308,187; John
M. Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, $328,600;
Edward I. O'Brien, president, Securities Industry Association,
$365,000; George H. Lawrence, president, American Gas Association,
$333,574; Charles J. DiBona, president, American Petroleum
Institute, $329,607; Harold B. Finger, president, U.S. Council for
Energy Awareness, $320,734.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation paid its president, Dean R.
Kleckner, $125,000. Horace R. Kornegay made $285,293 as chairman of
the Tobacco Institute.
   Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO, was paid $154,979, less
than both Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees ($173,360) and Mary H.
Futrell, president of the National Education Association ($159,890).
The late Jackie Presser, president of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters, made $272,601 in 1987.
   The best paid executive in the interest group category was Jay D.
Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, at $202,275.
   The magazine said its survey covered most trade groups with
budgets of more than $5 million a year and some smaller ones. Salary
figures were not available for several powerful groups, including
the American Bar Association and the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America. They had filed their 1987 tax returns before the new
disclosure requirement took effect, and have not yet filed 1988
returns.

   Cambodian guerrillas Monday renewed
their criticism of Vietnam during talks aimed at ending a decade of
fighting in Cambodia.
   A senior delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity said there
was no progress at Monday's sessions.
   Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, who organized the
talks, declined to comment on whether he remained optimistic the
talks would help bring peace to Cambodia.
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the son of Cambodian resistance leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, said the talks would fail because the
solution lay with the Soviet Union and China.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and installed a government of
its choosing. The Soviets arm the Vietnamese occupants, estimated at
up to 70,000 troops, and the Chinese arm the guerrillas.
   The coalition of guerrillas at the talks issued its third
statement Monday accusing Vietnam of thwarting the talks.
   ``By claiming to seek ... a political solution of the problem,
Vietnam has tried to induce the world community into accepting the
regime installed by it in Phnom Penh,'' the statement said.
   The talks brought together government leaders from Vietnam and
its allies Laos and the Cambodian government, and a resistance
coalition of the communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the
non-communist forces of Sihanouk.
   Also participating is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
which backs the guerrillas and represents Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Brunei.
   The 1975-78 Khmer Rouge regime, with up to 40,000 fighters the
most potent guerrilla force, killed hundreds of thousands of people
in trying to carry out their radical vision of a communist agrarian
society.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia to stop Khmer Route attacks on
its border, and many other nations also have demanded measures to
prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
   Haing S. Ngor, who in the movie ``The Killing Fields'' portrayed
a victim of the Khmer Rouge, was an observer at the talks and urged
any settlement to prevent the group from returning to power.
   ``They have killed the people of Cambodia,'' he said. ``They have
killed their own brothers.''

   Israeli troops Monday bulldozed or sealed the
homes of four Palestinians accused of firebomb attacks, and 20 Arabs
were wounded in clashes with soldiers on the second day of a general
strike.
   The strike, called by the PLO-linked United National Leadership
of the Uprising, kept businesses and transportion shut down in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. It was to continue Tuesday.
   The violence was part of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
rule of the occupied lands. Since the revolt began 14 months ago,
383 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.
   On Monday, the army declared Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city, a closed military zone and erected roadblocks at four
entrances.
   Troops stopped dozens of Arab-owned cars in the city and ordered
the drivers to remove outlawed Palestinian flags and pro-Palestine
Liberation Organization graffiti, an Arab reporter said.
   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said they treated four
Palestinians wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops in
several West Bank areas. The wounded included a 14-year-old boy from
Jenin who was shot in the stomach, the doctors said.
   In Jenin, troops bulldozed the house of a resident accused of
throwing three firebombs at an Israeli army vehicle, an army
official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said he did not know if anyone was injured in the attack.
   The army sealed the homes of three suspected firebomb throwers in
the villages of Hawwara and Dahiat al Barrad near Jerusalem, the
official said.
   The punishment of destroying or sealing homes usually is carried
out before a suspect is charged, a practice the United States and
international human rights groups say denies Palestinians due
process of law.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army imposed curfews that
confined about 70,000 Palestinians to their homes.
   In clashes in the Shati and Deir Al Balah refugee camps troops
shot and wounded 16 Palestinians. They included 12-year-old Alad Abu
Nahel, a Shati resident shot in the eye who is in danger of losing
it, and a seven-year-old shot in the leg, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed three wounded in the West Bank and said it was
checking other casualties.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli authorities ordered two
Palestinian journalists and an Arab writer held for six months
without trial, Arab reports said. The three were identified as Nabil
Joulani, Abdul Latif Gaith and Adnan Shalaldah.
   The move appeared to be part of an Israeli campaign against Arab
journalists that began Saturday with the six-month detention of
another journalist, Samaan Khouri.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens flew to Cairo for meetings on
possible Middle East peace talks Monday with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Wednesday with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday he hopes the talks lead
to a breakthrough in stagnated relations with Egypt and a
normalization of Israeli-Soviet ties.
   ``Maybe we're entering a more intensive stage in the Middle East
peace process,'' Shamir said on Israel TV's Arabic-language program.
``I'm not convinced in that, but I would like to hope that the
meeting with President Mubarak ... would renew something in
relations between us and Egypt, and would express some special
Egyptian activity regarding the peace process.''
   ``Maybe this meeting foretells some breakthrough,'' he added.
   Of Arens' scheduled meeting with Shevardnadze, Shamir said, ``I
think that with every meeting we are coming closer to a
normalization'' of the relations Moscow broke after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   Renewal of ties is an Israeli condition for a Soviet role in the
peace process.

   A volunteer firefighter was shot to death
by a motorist while directing traffic at a house fire, and another
firefighter's father was charged in the slaying, the sheriff said
Monday.
   Roy Lee Bailey, 67, was shot in the face as directed traffic
Sunday for the West End Volunteer Fire Department, said Sheriff
Ralph Johnson.
   William Alexander Crisp, 54, was charged with murder and held
without bail after he was arrested at his home.
   Johnson said that the men were acquaintances but that no motive
had been determined in the shooting, which occurred after Bailey
told the motorist he could drive no farther on a rural road because
of the fire.
   Fire Chief Randall Brackett said Crisp's son is also a volunteer.

   Rhode Island failed to meet a Monday
deadline for eliminating prison overcrowding and faces potential
fines of $50 a day for each of the 147 excess inmates.
   The intake center at the state prison complex held 397 people
Monday, said Joseph A. DiNitto, assistant to Corrections Director
John Moran.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond Pettine, responding to a complaint
from the American Civil Liberties Union, had set a limit of 250
prisoners at the intake center and threatened to impose fines of $50
per day for excess inmates.
   Pettine warned state officials Jan. 31 that he would be ``very
hard-nosed about this'' when he considers levying fines at a March
13 hearing.
   DiNitto said the state has made a good-faith effort to comply
with the judge's order, removing 135 inmates from the intake center
since Wednesday.
   ``We will be seeking implementation of the sanctions,'' said
Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island ACLU chapter.
``They're doing too little too late.''
   Brown said the ACLU sought a court order as early as 1986 to
prevent putting three inmates in a cell. There are 168 cells at the
intake center, according to DiNitto. The prison complex overall has
2,075 prisoners.
   Brown said the Corrections Department ``rejected out of hand''
several ACLU proposals, including weekend court sessions to process
people arrested on minor crimes and bail standards that would ensure
speedier release.

   President Bush will meet with congressional
leaders Tuesday in an effort to give new impetus to budget
discussions that will take place while he is on a five-day Asian
tour.
   Bush made three out-of-town speeches on his fiscal 1990 budget
proposal last week, capping the appearances with a declaration in
St. Louis that he wanted ``a quick and early resolution'' to the
budget problem.
   The president on Feb. 9 proposed a $1.16 trillion spending plan
for the budget year that will begin Oct. 1. Bush would increase the
spending former President Reagan had proposed for several social
programs, including child care, adoption, AIDS, the homeless, the
environment, space exploration and anti-drug abuse efforts.
   In recent weeks, however, Democrats have been pushing Bush to
spell out where he would make $10 billion to $11 billion in
necessary cuts to pay for the emphasis he wants to give certain
programs.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and House Speaker
Jim Wright of Texas are among the congressional leaders set to take
part in the Tuesday morning White House session with Bush.

<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO leaders opened their annual
meeting Monday with an eye on domestic policy, backing a broad
congressional agenda that includes calls for a higher minimum wage,
day care and parental leave.
   The 35-member Executive Council of the labor federation also met
with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. On Tuesday, union
leaders plan to sit down with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   The council issued four policy statements on its domestic
priorities, including one on the needs of working families that
called for passage of bills guaranteeing parental leave and
expanding day care opportunities.
   ``The working standards and social services provided by these
legislative initiatives will enable workers to be both productive
employees and responsible family members,'' the statement said. ``As
we promote the economic security and stability of families, we
advance the economic and social health of the nation.''
   The federation also promised full support of 9,000 Machinists who
are set to strike against Eastern Airlines on March 4. The
Machinists are threatening to picket other carriers that have
service agreements with Eastern or its parent corporation, Texas Air.
   The council also established a committee to study the needs of
working families and suggest changes in laws and contract language.
   In calling for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been
frozen at $3.35 for eight years, the 1.9-million member labor
organization said it would take $4.56 to purchase what $3.35 bought
when that level was set in 1981.
   Legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., would
increase the minimum wage to $4.55 through three annual increases of
40 cents.
   Mitchell, after his meeting with the labor leaders, said he would
bring to the Senate floor for debate a minimum wage bill that does
not contain a sub-minimum youth training wage that President Bush
has said would have to be included for him to support it.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and Mitchell said it was too
early to rate Bush's relationship with labor, but both said the new
president was off to a better start than President Reagan, whose
relationship with labor was acrimonious from the outset.
   ``The atmosphere has changed considerably and I certainly welcome
that,'' Kirkland said. ``We still have to see what the concrete
product is.''

   Nearly 200 cars and trucks slammed into
each other in separate accidents Monday on fog-bound highways in
northern and central Italy. Police said 13 people were killed and
more than 100 injured.
   Two major pileups occurred during morning rush hour near Piacenza
in the north and near Imola and Ferrara in central Italy. Thick fog
reduced visibility to near zero, police said.
   Highways from Milan to Modena and Bologna to Ferrara _ two major
road links _ were closed for about five hours after the accidents.
   Police said most of the injured were hospitalized in Piacenza.
   Large parts of Italy have been plagued by fog and smog in recent
weeks following three months without rain.

   Prayers and tears marked the opening Monday of a
museum on the sixth floor of the old Texas School Book Depository
from which Lee Harvard Oswald is believed to have fired the shots
that killed President John F. Kennedy.
   Some came to forget that November day a quarter century ago when
Kennedy was assassinated. Others came to recall the legacy and hope
of his administration.
   ``Our purpose is not to preserve the memory of that death. ... It
is not in our power to preserve what already lives so powerfully any
more than we could erase or escape this history,'' Dallas County
Judge Lee F. Jackson said at the opening ceremony of The Sixth Floor
museum.
   ``The lessons of history found here will be passed, like a torch,
to all generations.''
   The Rev. G. James Christopher of the St. Mark African Methodist
Episcopal Zion Church said: ``About 26 years ago America was
wounded. But today we stand here whole again.''
   Several hundred invited guests attended the opening ceremony on
Monday, President's Day, then viewed the collection examining
Kennedy's life and death.
   The exhibit in what is now the Dallas County Administration
Building contains 350 photographs, 30 artifacts, a 30-minute audio
tour and six films running a total of 40 minutes. It was organized
by the Dallas County Historical Foundation.
   Packed with people, the room was nevertheless quiet, save for
some small talk and a couple of children asking questions.
   Jeremy Livingston, 4, looked up at his father, Jerome Livingston,
a computer programmer from New York. ``Why would anyone want to kill
a president?'' the boy asked.
   For many the tears fell only when they came to the window where
investigators said Oswald ate his lunch on Nov. 22, 1963, and waited
for the presidential motorcade as it moved through streets lined
with cheering crowds.
   ``I guess that's when it hit me,'' said Danny Veno, 33, of
Dallas. ``I got a big lump in my throat when I saw this window. I've
waited a long time to see this. A long, long time.''
   That corner window is walled off by glass. Stacks of books and
boxes are arranged just as they were more than 25 years ago.
Visitors gathered at windows a few feet away and stared down at Elm
Street, sharing the view of the sniper.
   ``It took me back, that view, it really did,'' said Pat
Radmacher, 38, of Grandbury.
   Clifford Carr, 47, of Spring Lake, N.J., said he planned a
business trip to Dallas to coincide with the exhibit's opening and
his son's spring break. He and his 14-year-old son Jason walked
along Dealy Plaza and the grassy knoll, which figures in many
assassination conspiracy theories, after visiting The Sixth Floor.
   ``It kind of feels like 1963 all over again,'' Clifford Carr said.
   Dallas residents have debated whether there should be official
recognition of the Kennedy assassination in the city where he was
killed.
   The museum opening, Christopher said, shows Dallas has ``finally
reconciled the pain of the past with the promise of hope for the
future.''
   People began lining up outside more than two hours before the
museum's opening. Cindy McLendon, a local ticket agent, said 3,000
visitors were expected Monday. More than 500,000 visitors are
expected annually.

   Economic issues and Bonn's
reluctance to replace short-range nuclear missiles dominated summit
talks Monday between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Friedhelm Ost, Kohl's chief spokesman, said economic issues
topped the agenda. He played down differences over modernizing
short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``We are closer on many points than most people suspect,'' Ost
told reporters.
   He said both leaders agreed that NATO allies must demonstrate
unity at a summit meeting scheduled for this spring.
   Ost said Kohl reiterated his desire for wide-ranging efforts in
arms control and disarmament.
   Kohl said last week he wanted to see the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization include a disarmament mandate in its general strategy
statement to be issued after its summit. That clause would require
NATO to open talks aimed at removing short-range missiles if the
Soviets cut down their conventional arms advantage.
   The two leaders also discussed problems coupled with implementing
the planned barrier-free West European market in 1992, and a
proposed single European currency, he said. Britain strongly opposes
the currency proposal.
   ``There is a determination on the part of both countries to work
close together'' on the missiles issue, said Bernard Ingham, Mrs.
Thatcher's spokesman, after the hourlong meeting.
   He also reiterated Mrs. Thatcher's determination the weapons be
replaced.
   ``The prime minister believes that you won't get anywhere without
demonstrating a strong defense,'' Ingham said.
   Kohl has said he wants to put off until 1991 or 1992 a decision
on whether to replace the approximately 600 Lance missiles stationed
in West Germany, rather than make the issue part of next year's
national election campaign.
   The British government, however, has been pushing to replace the
aging missiles and boost West European defenses.
   West Germans have become increasingly interested in better ties
with the Soviet bloc, and fear introducing new missiles could thwart
progress already made.
   Kohl discussed the issue last week with visiting Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, and the two sides did their best to
minimize potential conflicts.
   U.S. officials hope to replace the Lance missiles aimed at East
Germany and Czechoslovakia with rockets capable of traveling up to
300 miles. The current missiles have a range of nearly 75 miles.
   Ost said Kohl and Thatcher also discussed preparations for the
NATO summit expected in May or June, and the investigation into the
December bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   West German officials have displayed increasing annoyance over
British investigators' suggestions that the bomb that destroyed the
Boeing 747 was placed on board in Frankfurt.
   Earlier Monday, police helicopters circled overhead and many
downtown streets were blocked off as Mrs. Thatcher toured Frankfurt
landmarks.
   With attacks by the Irish Republican Army always a danger,
special precautions were taken for her visit, including deployment
of more than 2,000 police.
   Thousands of people lined the streets to cheer Mrs. Thatcher as
she visited St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt Cathedral, and other sites.
   There also was dissent. Early in the evening, 150 people marched
peacefully through parts of downtown Frankfurt in a protest against
Mrs. Thatcher's economic policies organized by the German Communist
Party.
   The summit will close after a second round of talks Tuesday.

<HEAD>Government Spokesman Defends Takeshita Comments on War Role</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief government spokesman Monday defended Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita's statement that it is difficult to judge
whether Japan was an aggressor in World War II.
   Takeshita said last week during questioning in Parliament that
some people believe the war began by accident or was fought in
self-defense. He said the question of whether Japan was an aggressor
would have to be decided by historians some time in the future.
   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said Monday that Takeshita's
comments were ``in line with the government's long-standing view. It
is regrettable if what the prime minister really meant was
misunderstood'' by people in other countries, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   Obuchi noted Takeshita also said that Japan caused neighboring
countries a great deal of misery in the past, and therefore it is
determined to contribute to world peace to avoid a repeat of such
suffering.
   Asked last week about Takeshita's comments, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said World War II was a ``war of
aggression (that) brought tremendous suffering to the Chinese people
and the people in Asia as a whole.''
   He said the suffering and Japan's war responsibility ``are a
historical fact which cannot be changed by anyone.''
   In South Korea, the Yonhap News Agency said Takeshita's remarks
about the war were ambiguous and glossed over Japan's responsibility
for war atrocities.
   Japan's war role has remained a controversial issue here. Last
May, National Land Agency chief Seisuke Okuno, a Cabinet minister,
resigned after Asian countries strongly criticized him for
repeatedly stating that Japan was not an aggressor in the war.
   Members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party say many among
them continue to share Okuno's belief.

   A federal appeals court Monday blocked
the execution of a man less than 24 hours before he was to die in
the electric chair for murdering and raping a homemaker in 1983.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta granted an
indefinite stay for a three-judge panel to hear Anthony Bertolotti's
appeal.
   It was the fifth stay granted in the case since Gov. Bob Martinez
signed Bertolotti's death warrant Jan. 31.
   Bertolotti, 36, had been scheduled to die Tuesday morning at
Florida State Prison near Starke for the murder of Carol Ward, 46,
in her home. He stole $31 and began stabbing Ms. Ward when she tried
to persuade him to put down his weapon, according to testimony.
   Defense attorneys contend Bertolotti's previous lawyers failed to
have an expert determine his sanity before the trial.

   Inmates protesting mistreatment by
guards set beds on fire and tried to take control of a prison in a
western town, but the uprising ended after a blaze killed seven
prisoners and authorities moved in, officials said.
   Some officials said the deadly fire during the Sunday night riot
was caused by the burning mattresses, but other reports said an
electrical short circuit was the cause. San Felipe Gov. Jose de
Jesus said police were investigating.
   Officials said 29 inmates were injured in the melee in a prison
ward in San Felipe, 140 miles west of the capital, Caracas.
   De Jesus told a news conference the prisoners rioted at mealtime
to protest mistreatment by guards.
   Carlos Riera Vaquero, San Felipe's civil defense director, said
in a telephone interview that some inmates set beds on fire as
others moved to the administrative offices apparently to seize arms
and take control of the prison. But other sources said the fire
started with an electrical short circuit.
   Police said the riot ended when the fire quickly spread and
caused inmates to panic. It was not known if rebelling inmates were
among the dead or injured.
   Salazar said police and National Guard troops controlled the fire
and the mutiny in about four hours.
   The governor urged the 50,000 residents of San Felipe to remain
calm, and police and guardsmen kept the prison under heavy guard
Monday.
   The fire burned most of Ward-A, one of the four wards at San
Felipe's Internado Judicial, and part of the administrative offices.
The prison had a total of 229 inmates, Caracas newspaper El
Universal said.

   European Common Market governments decided Monday to withdraw
their top diplomats from Iran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's renewed order for Moslems to kill novelist Salman
Rushdie. Britain went further by pulling out its entire embassy
staff.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the death threats
against Rushdie and the publishers of ``The Satanic Verses'' for
allegedly blaspheming Islam were ``unwarranted interference'' in
Britain's internal affairs.
   He left open the possibility of expelling Iran's lone diplomat in
London, where Rushdie lives.
   The 12 European Economic Community governments, in a sharp blow
to Iran's hopes of improving relations with Western nations, decided
to recall their diplomats for consulations and suspend high-level
visits to and from Iran.
   They said they also will restrict the movement of Iranian
diplomats in their countries.
   Howe told a news conference that the EEC foreign ministers,
meeting in Brussels, had sent ``a strong, concerted signal to the
Iranian leadership that Khomeini's threats are an affront to
international standards of behavior and will not be tolerated.''
   For Britain's part, he said, ``it is no longer sensible to
maintain a diplomatic presence in Tehran.''
   He said Iran's charge d'affaires in London, Mohammad Basti, would
be summoned to hear ``the reasons for this action along with the
implications for Mr. Basti and his mission.''
   Asked if that meant closing the Iranian Embassy, he replied: ``I
leave it for your own conclusions.''
   In London, Basti was summoned and told of the decision but made
no immediate comment.
   Rushdie, 41, apologized Saturday for any distress the publication
of his book caused to Moslems, after Iranian President Ali Khamenei
indicated that an apology could lead to a pardon.
   On Sunday, however, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted Khomeini as ruling out any reprieve for Rushdie and urging
Moslems to ``send him to hell'' for his writings.
   Neither Khomeini's statement nor IRNA referred to Khamenei's
comments, reflecting a widening rift in the Iranian hierarchy over
the Rushdie affair.
   ``There plainly is confusion amongst the Iran authorities,'' Howe
said.
   He added, however: ``If the threat were turned into fact, that
would call for an even more serious response, but I hope that it
will not come to that.''
   Iran's deputy parliament speaker, Mehdi Karrubi, reaffirmed
Khomeini's execution order Monday.
   ``Without doubt, Salman Rushdie, and those following the same
line of thought, have no other fate but death and destruction and
banishment to hell,'' Karrubi said at a meeting at Khomeini's home
broadcast on Iranian television. The TV showed Khomeini sitting
impassively on a balcony above a crowd of several hundred men waving
clenched fists and chanting ``Death to America!'' and ``Long Live
Khomeini!''
   Rushdie, an Indian-born Moslem, has been in hiding, reportedly
under armed police guard, since Khomeini decreed Feb. 14 that he
should be killed and two Iranian religious leaders put a $5.2
million bounty on his head.
   In London, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual
leader of Anglicans worldwide, appealed to Britain's Moslem
community to contain its anger.
   Commenting on the controversy for the first time, Runcie
aknowledged the book had deeply offended Moslems. But he condemned
the murder call and asked Moslem leaders ``to have regard to the
expression of profound regret that Salman Rushdie issued on
Saturday.''
   The Swiss foreign ministry in Bern called in Iran's ambassador to
express concern about the death threat, but did not plan to withdraw
its ambassador from Tehran, said ministry spokesman Lorenzo Schnyder
von Wartensee.
   Howe said normal relations between Britain and Iran would be
impossible until Iran repudiates violence and respects other
countries' laws.
   Asked whether the latest rupture would worsen the plight of
Western hostages in Lebanon and British businessman Roger Cooper,
who is jailed in Tehran, Howe said: ``Nobody can pretend that it
makes our task ... any easier.''
   Britain's embassy in Tehran, closed for eight years, reopened in
December.
   The two countries had all but severed diplomatic relations in
1987 following the arrest of an Iranian diplomat for shoplifting in
Britain and the retaliatory beating of a British diplomat in Iran.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' portrays the prophet
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggests that he wrote, rather
than Allah, the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   The novel is banned in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, India, Egypt
and South Africa. Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and
Turkey have canceled plans to publish it.
   Israel's Keter publishing house promised a Hebrew edition within
weeks, and Moslem leaders there vowed to block it.
   An anonymous caller claiming to represent the Guardians of the
Islamic Revolution telephoned news agencies in London and threatened
to kill Howe and Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, and bomb British
airlines, pubs, discos and government offices. The caller also
threatened a British TV anchorman for exchanging sharp words with
Basti on the air.
   The group also has claimed responsibility for the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people when it exploded and crashed
in Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21.
   The head of IRNA in Madrid said he was willing to kill Rushdie.
Ali Akhbar Jaban told the private Cadena SER radio network that ``as
far as I know, there are at least 50 million Iranians ready to do
it'' _ himself among them.
   In Yugoslavia, the official daily Borba stopped printing a daily
series of excerpts from ``The Satanic Verses'' in an apparent
goodwill gesture toward Khamenei, who arrived Monday in Belgrade for
a three-day visit.

<TEXT>
   The leader of Lebanon's main Christian
militia escaped assassination, but one of his bodyguards was killed
and a second was wounded when gunmen ambushed his motorcade on
Monday, police said.
   A police spokesman said Samir Geagea, 39, riding in a bulletproof
BMW car, was unhurt after his escorts shot it out for five minutes
with men who intercepted the six-vehicle motorcade on Christian east
Beirut's Jisr El-Basha highway.
   The attackers escaped and no group claimed responsibility, he
said.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the ambushers
raked the motorcade as it approached an intersection in Jisr
El-Basha at 11:45 a.m.
   The militia leader was driving to a meeting with army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun, and soldiers took charge of escorting him to the
meeting at the presidential palace in east Beirut's Baabda suburb,
the spokesman reported.
   A U.N. official said meanwhile that Israeli tank fire Sunday
night wounded two Norwegian officers serving with the United Nations
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon. He said both officers were
hospitalized in stable condition.
   Monday marked the first direct meeting between Aoun and Geagea
since last week's bloody confrontation between the Lebanese Forces
militia and Aoun's Christian regular units.
   The inter-Christian fighting for control of the Christian
heartland east and northeast of Beirut killed more than 76 people
and wounded 200, by police count.
   Aoun's 20,000 troops now hold 75 per cent of the Christian
enclave in divided Lebanon, split into Christian and Moslem sectors
by a civil war now in its 14th year.
   Geagea later described Monday's talks as positive and told
reporters, ``We can consider all last week's incidents as a thing of
the past.''
   Aoun had no comment on the meeting.
   Geagea appeared on his militia's television station eight hours
after the ambush and called it an ``an accident.''
   Sources close to Geagea said on condition of anonymity that he
was playing down the attack to avert a new outbreak of fighting with
the army.
   Military sources, also speaking privately, said the army is
investigating the assassination attempt. They noted it occurred in
no man's land between army and militia frontlines.
   In Tyre, the U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said an Israeli tank fired at the officers Sunday night as they
patrolled on foot within their area of operations in the foothills
of Mount Hermon.
   The tank was inside Israel's self-designated security zone, which
overlaps areas policed by the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, he said.
   One Norwegian suffered a shrapnel wound in his left leg and the
other was hit in the chest, the official said. A Swedish soldier
with them escaped injury.
   Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren, the Swedish commander of U.N.
observers, protested the incident to the Israeli army, which
promised an investigation.
   The U.N. force has been stationed in south Lebanon since 1978.
   Israel established a buffer zone in south Lebanon in 1985 after
withdrawing the bulk of its forces following a three-year occupation
of Lebanon.

   National Guard troops in combat fatigues
bathed and fed patients Monday at state-run General Hospital after
scores of nurses and attendants walked out in a contract dispute.
   The state, citing a law against strikes by state employees,
sought a court order forcing workers to return to the 480-bed,
mostly long-term-care hospital. Superior Court Judge Antonio S.
Almeida said he would rule Tuesday.
   Thomas Romeo, director of the state Department of Mental Health,
Retardation and Hospitals, accused the members of Local 1350,
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, of
``walking away from patients'' and said patients' lives were
threatened.
   ``Not all the individuals up there right now know exactly what
they're doing. There's not a lot of tolerance for error,'' Romeo
said.
   Seven of the 110 Guard troops on duty Monday had nursing
training; the rest were given non-medical tasks like feeding,
washing and dressing patients.
   More than a dozen acute-care patients were transferred to other
hospitals, and the facility stopped admissions.
   ``I think this is totally uncalled for,'' Connie Prior, 56, a
quadriplegic who has been at the hospital for two years, said of the
job action. ``Number one should be the patients.''
   Patient Louise Baran, herself a registered nurse, said she felt
comfortable about the care being given, and while she didn't fault
either side in the dispute was disappointed it had reached the point
of a walkout.
   A four-day sickout ended Jan. 31 when the Guard was called in.
   Doctors on Monday reported as usual, but about one-fifth of the
89 attendants and fewer than half the 13 licensed practical nurses
showed up for the first shift, officials said. About half the 26
registered nurses honored the picket line, said Dan Caley, an MHRH
spokesman.
   Only one of 117 attendants scheduled to work at the state
Institute of Mental Health, also staffed by union members, reported
for work Monday morning, said Romeo.
   Twenty of twenty-four licensed practical nurses and about 25 of
61 attendants reported for the 3 p.m. shift, although some of those
may have been held over from the morning shift, said James Benedict,
hospital director.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete called out the Guard late Sunday after the
union voted 4-1 to reject a proposed 53-cent-an-hour raise offered
in return for concessions on staffing, including a reduction in
overtime and greater management leeway in transferring staffers from
ward to ward.
   Under that offer, attendants' salaries, for example, would go
from $16,600 to $17,600.
   The union, which has 1,300 members, about half of whom work at
General Hospital, is upset with a new hospital policy not to replace
absent employees to curb overtime.
   DiPrete has ordered the MHRH to erase a $3.5 million projected
deficit by the July 1 end of the fiscal year.
   Negotiations broke down Friday, and no new talks were scheduled.
   About two dozen people arrived by late morning in response to a
hospital appeal for volunteers, said a volunteer who would not give
her name.
   National Guard member Sue McCabe, a registered nurse called in
from her shift at Warwick's Kent County Memorial Hospital, said she
was caring for about 10 patients, ``so that's not really a big
deal.''
   One protester, a therapist who would not give her name, said she
felt no qualms about the walkout. ``I think it's for a good cause,''
she said. ``We have a medical emergency staff (on call) in case
anything should happen. It's not like we're totally abandoning
them.''

   Wreckage of a plane carrying 10 people on a
family outing to Disneyland was found near a mountaintop Monday, and
there were no survivors, authorities said.
   The twin-engine plane on a chartered flight crashed Sunday less
than 200 feet from the top of a 2,270-foot ridge in the Santa Ana
Mountains, 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   Searchers wading through chest-high brush found at least nine
bodies, said sheriff's Lt. John Gillis.
   ``The bodies and baggage were ripped apart and scattered over the
peak,'' said KNX-AM reporter Bob Tur, who discovered the wreckage
during a helicopter flight. The fuselage was twisted, broken into
pieces and partly buried, he said.
   The plane left Las Vegas on Sunday morning for Orange County John
Wayne Airport, said Civil Air Patrol Lt. Col. Ed Crankshaw.
   There was no indication of an emergency when controllers talked
to the pilot shortly after noon as the plane was cruising about four
miles east of Corona, said Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer Tommy Aina.
   Merrill Pugmire, bishop of the family's Mormon Church in Las
Vegas, identified the passengers as police Officer Michael Cranson,
37, his wife, Raeann, 35; their five children, ages 7 to 15; Mrs.
Cranson's sister, Cynthia Pranaske Montano, 23, and her husband,
James Montano, whose age was not available.
   The pilot was Hassan Barro, said Marty Kay, spokesman for Las
Vegas Flyers, the charter outfit that provided the plane. Barro's
age was not available.
   The family was on its way to Disneyland, said another spokesman
for the Mormon Church, Don Christensen.
   The plane went down 20 miles from the Orange County airport.

   A West German company suspected of
playing a key role in building a poison gas factory in Libya said
Monday it produced and shipped an illegal drug known as ``Ecstasy''
to the United States.
   A spokesman for the Imhausen-Chemie company of Lahr said the
company manufactured and shipped MDMA, but he said Imhausen was not
aware the substance was covered by West Germany's strict drug laws.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said MDMA,
which stands for methylenedioxymethamphetamine, was placed on the
controlled substance list recently and the company was not aware of
the change.
   MDMA, an amphetamine derivative, is known among users as
``Ecstasy'' for the warm, friendly feelings they say it produces. It
has been found to cause brain cell damage in animals. Conclusive
studies on humans have not been done, and scientists do not know
precisely how it works.
   The ZDF television network reported Monday night that if it is
determined company officials knew the drug deal was illegal, they
would face more severe penalties for that offense than if they are
convicted in the Libyan affair.
   Offenburg prosecutor Werner Botz said four suspects had been
arrested in the case so far on suspicion of illegal production and
delivery of a controlled substance.
   Botz said two of the suspects were American. He said one was
arrested in West Germany and a second in the United States, but he
did not provide further details about the two.
   Police also arrested two employees of Imhausen: a chemist and a
purchasing agent. The chemist has since been released, Botz said.
   Botz said the Imhausen employees in September sold the Americans
374 pounds of the substance with an estimated value of more than
$16.7 million.
   The federal criminal investigation office in Wiesbaden said the
drug deal was one of the largest uncovered in recent years.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether the company's
president, Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, was aware of the deal, Botz
said.
   Police in Lahr, meanwhile, said the condition of an Imhausen
official who apparently attempted suicide last week had improved.
They said Imhausen executive Hans Renner was in stable condition
after being treated for a drug overdose.
   Imhausen-Chemie is the target of a federal criminal investigation
into its involvement in the building of the Libyan plant.
   The United States contends the factory at Rabta, south of Tripoli
is designed to produce chemical weapons. Libya says it is for
manufacturing pharmaceuticals.

<HEAD>Two Soviets, Three Others Sought in Spy Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy broke up a KGB spy ring seeking highly
sophisticated military information, and a magistrate issued arrest
warrants Monday for two Soviets and three others said to work for
the ring, news reports said.
   Italian secret agents last week raided separate KGB rings in
Trieste, an Adriatic port near the Yugoslav border, and La Spezia,
on the northwest Ligurian coast, according to Italian newspapers and
television.
   Investigators in Trieste said Monday that the spying operation
foiled there could have seriously damaged Italy's defense
capabilities. Authorities in Trieste last week arrested Giorgio
Stancich, 42, an Italian electronics technician living in Yugoslavia
near the Italian border.
   Stancich, who worked for a firm in Trieste that manufactures
electronic communications systems, was arrested with documents
related to a highly advanced electronic warfare system known as
Catrin, the reports said.
   The project, still under development but considered one of the
most sophisticated systems of its kind and destined for use by NATO,
involves computer systems capable of directing an entire battle,
including ground and air operations, according to the reports.
   In La Spezia, Investigating Magistrate Maria Cristina Failla
issued five arrest warrants Monday, news reports said.
   Italy's ANSA and AGI news agencies said the warrants were for
Natalino Francalanci, 51, a fur dealer from the Pisa area; a former
carabinieri police officer; a former Soviet trade representative in
Italy; another Soviet, and a Bulgarian.
   Of the group, only Francalanci has been apprehended, the reports
said. Repeated calls to the prosecutor's office Monday went
unanswered.
   Francalanci was accused of trying to procure secrets from Oto
Melara, a La Spezia firm developing technology for fiber optics and
producing carbon fiber plating for a new combat vehicle, news
reports said.
   Newspapers said Italian agents posed as technicians in the La
Spezia firm and provided Francalanci with documents to trace the spy
ring.
   Newspaper accounts said agents in Vienna, Austria, masterminded
the KGB network.
   In the first official comment on the case, Trieste magistrates
said Stancich's arrest capped ``an extremely arduous and delicate
investigation.''
   ``The brilliant operation foiled the attempt to cause grave
damage to the military defense system,'' said the written statement
by Giovanni Virdis and Antonio de Niccolo.
   They gave no details, saying the investigation was continuing.
   Milan's Corriere Della Sera, without citing sources, said KGB
agents and half a dozen Italians involved in the case fled Italy
when they realized the ring was broken.
   It said the KGB agent who hired Stancich was a former Tass news
agency correspondent in Rome.
   ANSA, quoting unidentified investigative sources, said at least
10 people were involved in the espionage network.
   The Soviet Embassy in Rome said Monday it never heard of the
people arrested and that all Soviet diplomats and trade
representatives in Italy ``worked only for the reciprocally
advantageous development of cooperation between our two countries.''

<TEXT>
   The trials of Vaclav Havel and
other dissidents, which open Tuesday, have caused protest in the
East and emphasize the contrast between Prague's rigid leadership
and a more liberal Kremlin.
   Those protests, along with widespread criticism in the West,
apparently prompted the communist authorities to toughen laws on
public order but also offer dialogue in an attempt to contain
dissent.
   Havel, a 52-year-old banned playwright, is Czechoslovakia's
best-known human rights activist.
   He and the eight others being tried were arrested Jan. 16 during
a week of protest honoring Jan Palach, a student who burned himself
alive in 1969 to protest the death of reform after the Soviet-led
invasion of August 1968.
   The January protests seemed to surprise the leaders Moscow
installed after Alexander Dubcek's liberal ``Prague Spring'' a
generation ago and underline their dilemma now that Moscow is
introducing many of the same reforms.
   After the protests, most of whose participants were in their
teens and early 20s, chief ideologist Jan Fojtik declared in a
speech Jan. 25 that the Communist Party no longer could ignore
dissent.
   Police violence that was used to suppress all but one of the
protests also prompted uncustomary public criticism by intellectuals
of the official establishment.
   In an interview Sunday, Havel's brother, Ivan, said more than
2,000 people had signed a petition calling for the release of all
dissidents and a dialogue between the authorities and society.
   A separate petition was sent to the government by scientists at
about 70 institutes and even communist youth groups have made
written protests of the police violence, dissidents and other
sources have reported privately.
   ``The support is enormous and unexpected, and I think the
government is somewhat puzzled by the situation,'' Ivan Havel said.
   A new group called Polish-Hungarian Solidarity released its first
statement Sunday, condemning the trials of Havel and the other
dissidents. The statement signed by 21 prominent Polish opposition
figures and 11 Hungarian activists was released in Warsaw.
   Opposition activist Jozef Pinior said Monday that the group,
created over the weekend, will function like an existing
organization linking the Polish and Czechoslovak opposition
movements, Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity.
   Ten years ago, only the West reacted vehemently to the sentencing
of Havel and five other activists on sedition charges.
   The United States, Britain and other Western governments and
organizations also have called for the release of Havel and the
others now held, but this time the official Hungarian Writers' Union
joined them, sending a letter to the Czechoslovak Embassy in
Budapest.
   According to the Western complaints, the trials and those being
prepared for 55 of the hundreds of people briefly detained in
January contravene human rights agreements reached last month at the
Vienna review conference on European security and cooperation.
   A Soviet commentary coinciding with a visit to Moscow last week
by Premier Ladislav Adamec took note of intellectual discontent in
Czechoslovakia, tracing it to the anti-Soviet mood and ``deep
disillusionment'' that followed the 1968 invasion. Excerpts were
published Monday by the Czechoslovak party daily Rude Pravo.
   Some observers saw the commentary as a sign the Kremlin wants
more political reform in Czechoslovakia.
   Adamec was quoted Monday as telling Czechoslovak reporters in
Moscow he favors ``entirely concrete, matter-of-fact and frank
discussion'' with the authors of the petitions to the government.
   Party chief Miroslav Stepan visited reformist Hungary and already
has met with several cultural figures who signed the petitions in an
apparent attempt to still dissent, sources reported.
   Authorities toughened laws on public order last week, however,
doubling jail terms and fines allowable for violations and for
distribution of underground literature and other disapproved
material.
   Activists said the measures appear aimed at discouraging new
unrest over the trials.
   Havel is charged with inciting people to an illegal act and with
obstructing a public officer. A prison term of up to two years is
possible on conviction.
   Although he has been in jail since Jan. 16, his family has not
been allowed to visit him. Ivan Havel said his brother's lawyer,
Josef Lzicar, described the writer as in good health and spirits.
   The eight others, to be tried in a separate Prague court, are
Sasha Vondra and Dana Nemcova, who speak for the Charter 77 human
rights movement; former spokeswoman Jana Sternova, and activists
Jana Petrova, Petr Placak, Ota Veverka, David Nemec and Stanislav
Penc.
   All are charged with hooliganism and face maximum prison
sentences of two years. Only Petrova and Vondra remain in jail.
   Charter 77 and Czechoslovakia's eight other leading independent
groups have sent an appeal for help in freeing the activists to the
goverments of all 34 other nations represented at the Vienna
conference.

   Relatives of hostages held in Lebanon
said Monday they hope the Bush administration is intensifying
efforts to secure the captives' release, but don't really know what
is being done.
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic,'' John Anderson, brother of hostage
Terry Anderson, said at a news conference during a weekend of
tributes to the hostages.
   ``George Bush, both in his inaugural address and a press
conference afterward, without prompting, brought up the hostage
issue,'' Anderson, of Ocala, Fla., said. ``Reagan never did once, in
four years.''
   When pressed on the issue at news conferences, Reagan invariably
said the government was pursuing the matter but that it would be
dangerous to talk about specifics.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, has been a hostage four years, longer than any of
the eight other Americans being held by pro-Iranian extremists in
Lebanon.
   John Anderson was joined by Thomas Cicippio of Norristown, Pa.,
whose brother Joseph has been a hostage since Sept. 12, 1986;
Estelle Ronneburg of Boise, Idaho, whose son, Jesse Turner, was
taken hostage Jan. 24, 1987; and Elaine and David Collett, of New
York, the wife and son of British hostage Alec Collett, who was
captured March 25, 1985.
   Other Americans believed held hostage in Lebanon are Alann Steen,
Thomas Sutherland, Frank Reed, Edward Tracy, Robert Polhill and U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. Richard Higgins.
   The relatives were in Oakland County, north of Detroit, Sunday
and Monday for events publicizing the hostages' plight. The
activities were planned by Ernest May of Pontiac and the city's
Bicentennial of the Constitution Committee.
   All five wore yellow ribbons that read ``Free the Hostages,'' and
sat next to pictures of their hostage relative at the news
conference.
   ``I feel President Bush has a little different attitude than
Reagan,'' said Cicippio.
   Cicippio said he felt former President Reagan shied away from the
hostage issue, and that the government fails to keep relatives fully
informed.
   ``I hear from the State Department about every two weeks,''
Cicippio said, adding the news he receives from the government
already has been in the media.
   Collett acknowledged that disclosing information about any plans
aimed at gaining release of the hostages was tricky.
   ``It's very difficult,'' Collett said. ``They cannot make public
various things they're doing. They're very sensitive issues.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Monday invited Egypt's
president to Moscow and scheduled meetings in the Egyptian capital
with Israel and the PLO in quest of a Middle East peace conference.
   But Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told reporters after 90
minutes of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that they
made no progress on the key obstacle blocking a peace conference _
Israel's refusal to sit with the PLO.
   Cairo was the focus of new peace efforts with the arrival Sunday
night of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who is on a
five-nation Middle East tour.
   He gave Mubarak a letter from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
extending an ``official and friendly invitation'' for the Egyptian
leader to visit Moscow.
   The message included ``some important presentation regarding a
Middle East settlement,'' Shevardnadze said in Russian through an
Arabic interpreter. He did not elaborate.
   After chastising Israel earlier for adopting a ``stubborn
position,'' Shevardnadze was scheduled to meet with Arens in Cairo
on Wednesday. There was a strong possibility he would meet with PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat separately on the same day.
   Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed
the Soviet and Israeli positions were not so far apart that they
could not be bridged on the subject of an international peace
conference.
   Shevardnadze proposed in Damascus, Syria, on Saturday that the
U.N. Security Council's five permanent members convene a preparatory
conference within nine months to arrange for Arab-Israeli
negotiations.
   Israel has said it would agree to preparatory talks, sponsored by
the Soviet Union and the United States, before direct negotiations
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. It has said the United
Nations also may play a role.
   However, Israel has refused to talks with the PLO, which it
contends is a terrorist organization bent on destroying the Jewish
state.
   Asked if progress was made in his talks with Mubarak on the
issue, Arens said: ``on the PLO there is no progress now.''
   But Arens described his talks with Mubarak as ``a very good
exchange of views'' that took place in a cordial atmosphere.
   Egypt's Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid called on Israel to
consider ``with an open mind and open heart'' the possibility of
talking to the PLO. The Palestinians, he told reporters after the
meeting, have shown ``a greater deal of flexibility and a great deal
of understanding.''
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in an unusually
upbeat statement that he hoped Arens' meetings with Mubarak and
Shevardnadze would foretell a breakthrough in the stagnated
Israeli-Egyptian relations and a normalization of Israeli-Soviet
ties.
   ``Maybe we are entering a more intensive stage in the Middle East
peace process,'' Shamir said in an interview broadcast on Israel
radio's Arabic service.
   The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel after the 1967
Middle East war, and Israel has said the Soviet Union may get
involved in the peace process only on the condition that it resume
ties with Israel.
   The Soviets and Israelis have permanent but low-level diplomatic
missions in each other's country but are represented by embassies of
Finland and the Netherlands.
   Shevardnadze, who first flew to Jordan and Syria, is to visit
Iraq and Iran before returning home Feb. 27.
   He is the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Jordan and is
the first high-ranking Soviet official to visit Egypt in 15 years.

   Police on Monday arrested the former
labor and justice minister, Jose Eugenio Jacquet, as he returned
from Brazil.
   Jacquet and four other ex-ministers face charges of corruption in
criminal court. At the time of the Feb. 3 coup that toppled
President Alfredo Stroessner, Jacquet was in Venezuela attending the
inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez.
   With the arrest of Jacquet, all the former ministers charged are
in custody except ex-Interior Minister Sabino Augusto Montanaro, who
remains sheltered at the Honduran Embassy.
   Eight other officials of the former regime, including Gen.
Stroessner's long-time private secretary Mario Abdo Benitez, also
face corruption charges and are under arrest.
   In another development, Juan Ramon Chaves, president of the
ruling Colorado Party, said general elections will take place May 1
and not be delayed as the opposition has requested.
   Opposition party leaders say they need more time to organize.
They have hinted they may boycott the polling if they do not get a
delay.
   ``We will give freedom to all political parties to participate in
May 1 elections, even if they have 10,000 members or 1,000. But the
elections will not be postponed,'' Chaves said after meeting with
provisional president Gen. Andres Rodriguez, whose coup ended
Stroessner's 34 years in power.
   Leaders of the Authentic Radical Liberal, the Christian Democrat
and the Revolutionary Febrerista parties met with the Rev. Ismael
Rolon, archbishop of Asuncion, to discuss conditions under which
they would participate in elections.
   ``We reiterated our call for a delay, but we also described some
basic modifications needed in the electoral law, the need to
negotiate democratically, the need for automatic voter registration
so that all citizens can participate, and the need for the ban on
coalition candidates to be lifted,'' said Euclides Acevedo,
president of the Revolutionary Febrerista Party.
   The three opposition parties, grouped into a coalition called the
National Accord, also sought a formal audience with Rodriguez.
   Last Friday, Rodriguez met privately with Acevedo and Jorge Dario
Cristaldo of the Christian Democrats in what Domingo Laino of the
Authentic Radical Liberal Party said was an attempt to split the
National Accord.
   Stroessner, in exile in Brazil, moved Monday from a government
guest house in the central part of the country to a vacation house
he owns on the southeast Atlantic coast.
   ``My wish is to remain in Brazil for some time,'' Stroessner, 76,
told TV Globo, Brazil's largest commercial network, as he arrived in
the coastal town of Guaratuba in a Brazilian Air Force plane.
``Brazilians have always been good friends.''
   During his rule, Stroessner vacationed frequently in Brazil. His
vacation house is in Guaratuba in Parana state, 550 miles southeast
of Rio de Janeiro.

<HEAD>Panel Orders Military To Integrate Women Into Combat Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Human Rights Commission on Monday
ordered the military to integrate women into combat units within the
next 10 years.
   The decision will have the force of law in 10 days if not
appealed in Federal Court.
   ``Full integration is to take place with all due speed, as a
matter of principle and as a matter of practice, for both active and
reserve forces,'' the three-member panel ruled.
   The commission said the current policy of introducing women into
combat units on a trial basis now should be considered preparation
for full integration.
   Women usually serve in non-combat roles and make up about 9
percent of Canada's 85,000-member armed forces.
   Max Yalden, commission chairman, said the there is no
justification for keeping women out of any branch of the military.
   Yalden said that although the commission set a 10-year deadline
for integration, ``10 years is a long long time. ... Perhaps when
they get down to the nitty-gritty they'll be able to do it a little
more quickly.''
   Capt. Doug Martin said the Defense Department would not comment
until it has studied the 78-page judgment.
   The Canadian Forces have been permitted women to join combat
units in an effort to determine whether they would hamper combat
effectiveness.

   Severe thunderstorms developed Monday over the lower Mississippi
Valley, spawning at least one tornado, and broad bands of rain and
snow extended across the central part of the nation.
   A tornado touched down near Alexandria, La., but officials said
there were no deaths and no major damage.
   A tornado watch was in effect for several hours Monday over much
of northern and western Louisiana, a small part of southeastern and
east-central Texas and a small part of western Mississippi.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended from southeastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi to western Kentucky. Flash flood
watches were posted into the night for Kentucky, southern Illinois,
southeastern Missouri, western Tennessee, northwestern Mississippi,
and southern and eastern Arkansas.
   The heaviest rain during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was 0.99
of an inch at Jonesboro, Ark., and 0.95 of an inch at Blytheville,
Ark.
   Snow extended from eastern Nebraska and eastern Kansas to
southern Lower Michigan. Snow also spread into the upper Ohio Valley.
   A winter storm watch was in effect into Tuesday for west-central
and northeastern Illinois, where up to 4 inches of snow had fallen
around Quincy by mid-afternoon Monday.
   Showers were scattered from the central Gulf Coast states to the
Carolinas.
   Elsewhere, light snow fell over the central Rockies.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Glasgow, Mont., to 84 at Tampa, Fla. Monday's low for the
Lower 48 states was 21 degrees below zero at Ely, Minn.
   For Tuesday, wet weather was forecast from the Mississippi Valley
to the Atlantic Coast, ranging from snow from the middle Mississippi
Valley into the upper Great Lakes to thunderstorms from the central
Gulf Coast over the Tennessee Valley, with showers elsewhere.
Scattered snow showers were forecast over the northern Rockies and
the northern high Plains. Scattered showers were forecast across the
Pacific Northwest, with rain along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Highs remaining below freeezing were predicted from Montana
through the Dakotas and the lower Missouri Valley to Upper Michigan,
including highs in the teens from northeastern Montana to northern
Montana; above 50 across the northern Pacific Coast region, and from
California through much of Texas to the southern and middle Atlantic
Coast; in the 70s in southern California and southern Arizona; and
in the 70s and lower 80s in the Southeast.

<HEAD>INS Commissioner Reveals Plan For Handling Central Americans Seeking
Asylum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Americans applying for asylum
will get an answer in as little as one day and will be subject to
immediate imprisonment if turned down, officials said Monday.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service staff in southern
Texas will be increased by 500 to patrol the border and speed up the
weeding out of ``frivolous'' asylum claims, INS Commissioner Alan
Nelson announced.
   More jails will be built to hold people who are turned down
pending their appeal or deportation, he said.
   ``We intend to send a strong signal to those people who have the
mistaken idea that by merely filing a frivolous asylum claim, they
may stay in the United States,'' Nelson said. ``This willful
manipulation of America's generosity must stop.''
   A group called the Brownsville Ad Hoc Refugee Committee
criticized the new INS policy as a ``mean-spirited attempt to deter
political refugees from applying for political asylum.''
   The policy will be phased in over the next several weeks. Nelson
said the INS hopes eventually to process most asylum applications in
the region in a day or two. Currently, asylum decisions can take
months.
   ``We hope to have same-day service,'' said INS spokeswoman
Virginia Kice.
   The changes came the same day the INS was allowed to reinstate a
policy restricting people seeking asylum from leaving southern Texas
while they await decisions.
   Before Dec. 16, the INS allowed Central American asylum seekers
to check in at its south Texas district, then travel anywhere in the
United States while their cases were reviewed. But after that date,
the agency made them stay in the Brownsville area during the review,
forcing them to live in tents and trying the patience of residents
and relief agencies.
   Responding to a lawsuit filed by attorneys representing asylum
seekers, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela issued a temporary order
Jan. 9 requiring the INS to once more allow the Central Americans to
travel. He ruled Friday that the INS could return to the policy of
restricting their movement.
   Tens of thousands of Central Americans are expected to cross the
Rio Grande into southern Texas this year, according to the INS,
which says political asylum requests from Central Americans have
risen almost sevenfold over the past four years. More than 50,000
sought asylum in fiscal year 1988, compared with 7,063 in 1985.
   According to INS records, 3,136 people applied for asylum between
Wednesday and Sunday at the agency's Port Isabel Processing Center,
a rural detention center 15 miles northeast of Brownsville, the main
entry point for asylum-seekers from war-torn and poverty-stricken
Central America.
   But INS officials maintain that most of the Central Americans are
here for economic reasons and do not qualify for asylum from
persecution.
   Robert Rubin, lead counsel in the lawsuit that led to the
restraining order, said INS detention ``should be the exception and
not the rule for asylum seekers.'' He said the United States should
show a ``humanitarian spirit.''
   Roughly half of the Central Americans seeking asylum are from
Nicaragua, Nelson said.
   ``In a real sense,'' said Rubin, in San Francisco, ``the INS has
become a prisoner of its own policy. And that policy as recently as
1987 and 1988 was to encourage Nicaraguans to come to the United
States because they would be granted asylum.
   ``Now, finally, the United States appears to be overwhelmed by
the numbers and it is no longer politically expedient'' to accept
the Nicaraguans.
   Under the new policy, those denied asylum can either return
immediately to their home countries or be given a hearing before an
immigration judge where they may renew their applications for asylum.
   Nelson said he did not know how long it might take for a person
to get that hearing before a judge.
   ``I think we're going to see detention in years,'' said
immigration lawyer Linda Yanez.
   While they await deportation, single adults will be detained at
prison-like INS detention centers; family groups may be allowed to
stay in less-restrictive facilities that will be set up, Nelson said.
   Nelson said if more detention space were needed, the agency could
erect tents to house up to 5,000 people within 10 days.
   Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza welcomed the plan. ``From the
standpoint of the city, I think it will be good in terms of taking
people and providing for them in a humanitarian way,'' Garza said.
   Although hundreds of Hondurans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and
Guatemalans have camped outside the Port Isabel Processing Center in
temperatures dropping into the 40s waiting to apply for asylum, many
have been grateful for their reception. Local residents have
provided food and blankets.
   ``We expected people at the border aiming rifles at us, but the
American people have been very kind, very generous, and we
appreciate it,'' said Honduran Marcio Nunez as he ate a meal of rice
and beans provided by members of a Port Isabel church.
   ``In Honduras, we have a very bad concept of the United States
because of all the Mexican movies showing mean agents,'' Nunez
added, ``but you have been very generous.''

<HEAD>Italian Drug Baron Arrested In Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal agents arrested an Italian who
allegedly directed cocaine shipments from Mexico to the United
States on behalf of Colombia's Medellin cartel, the attorney
general's office said Monday.
   Giuseppe Catania Ponsiglione, alias ``Pino Catani,'' was arrested
Saturday in Ciudad Juarez, bordering El Paso, Texas, after agents
seized more than a half ton of cocaine in Chihuahua state, said
Deputy Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo.
   Ponsiglione planned to receive the shipment of 1,430 pounds of
the unprocessed drug discovered on board a plane in the village of
Laguna Seca near Villahermosa in Chihuahua, a northern state, Coello
told a news conference.
   Authorities said they arrested three of Ponsiglione's Mexican
associates as well as two Colombians who piloted the plane.
   Agents determined that members of the Medellin cartel sent the
cocaine, according to a statement released at the news conference.
   In another development, army troops and federal judicial police
in the southern state of Oaxaca on Saturday seized a truck laden
with more than 1,600 pounds of cocaine stashed under a shipment of
peanuts, Coello said.
   Coello said both shipments were destined for the United States
and together would provide more than 9 million doses for cocaine
users once refined. He declined to estimate the street value of the
drugs.
   Authorities were continuing an investigation to determine whether
the two shipments were connected.
   Ponsiglione, using the alias Jose Castaneda Gutierrez, posed as a
businessman making men's shirts and jackets in Mexico as a cover for
his involvement with the Medellin cartel, the statement said.
   Coello said Ponsiglione allegedly was linked to a heroin
operation based in Marseilles, France, that inspired the filming of
a movie called ``White Heroin.''
   Mexican drug authorities were investigating a possible connection
between Ponsiglione and Gilberto Ontiveros Lucero, a Mexican drug
lord who was arrested Jan. 10 in Ciudad Juarez, according to the
statement.
   Ontiveros is under indictment in the United States, according to
U.S. officials. They maintain Ontiveros is responsible for much of
the cocaine that passes into the southwestern United States from
Mexico.

<TEXT>
   John Morrell &amp; Co. on Monday imposed a
contract cutting the wages of 2,000 workers at its strife-torn
meatpacking plant by up to 18 percent.
   The union said it would not strike despite a near-unanimous vote
against the contract, which one leader said destroyed 50 years of
bargaining.
   The plant has long been a focus of discord, with violent strikes,
lawsuits filed by management and the union, and huge fines for
safety violations.
   There was no violence reported Monday, and business went on as
usual, according to Gary Junso, a Morrell official.
   The old contract expired Nov. 20 and the company had renewed it
on a daily basis. But on Thursday, Morrell declared that talks with
the union had reached an impasse, allowing it to impose its own
contract.
   Members of the Food and Commercial Workers union met on Sunday,
and ``over 99 percent'' of those voting rejected the contract, said
Jim Lyons, local president.
   Lyons said a strike would not be in the best interest of the
union because it could negate back pay awards or unfair labor
practice complaints. More than half the plant's workers are
replacements hired during a 1987 strike.
   The union said it would file a complaint of unfair labor
practices against Morrell. On Friday, company officials said they
had filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint charging the
union with bad-faith bargaining.
   The contract cuts base union wages at the plant from $9.75 an
hour to $8 an hour. Benefits and seniority also were cut.
   The four-year contract ``virtually destroys 50 years of
bargaining'' and will ruin the standard of living for Morrell
workers, Lyons said.
   ``It's probably the worst contract that's ever been put
forward,'' said worker Bob Stuerman. ``We were at the top of the
heap, and that brings us down to the bottom.''
   The contract is not out of line with the meatpacking industry,
said Raoul Baxter, Morrell executive vice president. ``If we really
wanted to punish them, we would've taken them down to $6, which is
the real thing out there,'' he said.
   ``We would hope they would recognize our need to be competitive
and make a recommendation to help us get there,'' company negotiator
Brad Johnson said Sunday night. ``But I see no reason for optimism.''
   More than 200 of the plant's workers are union members who
crossed picket lines thrown up in 1987 by striking workers from
Morrell's plant at Sioux City, Iowa. About 600 union members were
called back to work after the strike and more than 1,100 replacement
workers hired during the strike are on the payroll.
   The replacements were making $9.25 before Monday's cut.
   In November, an arbitrator ruled that the sympathy strike was
legal, that all strikers should be returned to work and that Morrell
owed more than $40 million in back pay. Morrell has challenged the
award in federal court.
   Also last year, a federal jury awarded the company $24.6 million
in damages for what the panel decided were three illegal sympathy
strikes.
   Morrell also is fighting a $4.3 million fine, the largest ever
against a single employer by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   The fine involved hundreds of serious injuries to hand and arm
joints caused by the repetitive motion of the meatpacking line.

<HEAD>Sokomanu On Trial For Failed Bid To Form Interim Government</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Name Willy Jimmy cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President George Sokomanu went
on trial Monday with six others charged with mutiny and sedition in
his failed bid last year to form an interim government in the South
Pacific island nation.
   The charges carry a maximum of life imprisonment, according to
state-run Radio Vanuatu.
   Vanuatu, formerly the New Hebrides under British and French rule,
lies 1,400 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia. It became
independent in 1980.
   Supreme Court proceedings began after a confrontation between
security forces and the accused, the Australian Associated Press
said.
   At one stage, about a dozen paramilitary troops in combat
fatigues apparently threatened Sokomanu by cocking their
semi-automatic rifles when he initially refused a police order to
take his seat in the courtroom, it said.
   The defendants have been held in Port Vila jail without bail
since before Christmas. They arrived at the courthouse under heavy
guard.
   Sokomanu, who was dismissed from office last month, complained
that only foreign journalists were allowed to attend the trial,
which is expected to last a week.
   The government of Prime Minister Walter Lini issued a statement
earlier on Radio Vanuatu warning the public to stay away. Among
those attending are diplomats from Australia, Britain and New
Zealand.
   The seven are charged with inciting mutiny within Vanuatu's
security forces after Sokomanu tried to dissolve Parliament and to
replace Lini's elected government with an interim administration
headed by his nephew, Barak Sope.
   They also face charges of sedition, conspiracy and taking
unlawful oaths.
   Accused are: Sokomanu; Sope; former opposition leader Maxime
Carlot; former members of Parliament Willy Jimmy, John Naupa and
Frank Spooner; and John Kalotiti, a former presidential private
secretary.
   Most of Monday's proceedings were taken up by legal argument. No
pleas were made.
   The attempted coup in December followed a yearlong power struggle
between Lini and Sope. Sokomanu admitted at the time he was acting
unconstitutionally. He said the interim government would have called
elections within two months.
   He said he acted because the island economy was in shambles and
Lini was unfit to govern following a stroke. Sokomanu, like Lini,
took office in 1980.

   The first Soviet ambassador to the
European Community presented his credentials Monday to the chairman
of the EEC's council of ministers.
   Ambassador Wladimir Shemiatenko was received by Francisco
Fernandez Ordonez, the EEC council chairman.
   Ordonez, who is also Spain's foreign minister, presided at an EEC
ministerial meeting that marked improving relations with the East
bloc.
   The 12 Common Market countries opened a debate on what will be
their common policy toward the Soviet Union and other eastern
European countries. They passed the issue to their experts and will
discuss it again at a next meeting.
   They also gave the executive European Commission instructions to
negotiate trade and cooperation agreements with Poland and Bulgaria.
   The Soviet Union, which had ignored the EEC since it was created
more than 30 years ago, changed its mind last year and asked for
official relations. An agreement was signed in August between the
Common Market and the Comecon, the Eastern European economic
association.
   Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia last year were the first
Eastern European countries to appoint ambassadors to the EEC.

   A political accord in El Salvador is not
possible without a significant delay in next month's elections, a
Salvadoran guerrilla commander said Monday.
   Agreeing to a delay could mean a permanent end to combat, the
commander, Shafick Handal, said before meeting with representatives
of Salvadoran political parties.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front offered on
Jan. 24 to take part in elections and recognize the results if they
are postponed until September and if other electoral changes are
made to guarantee a fair vote.
   Salvadoran political parties taking part in the March 19 vote
agreed to meet in Mexico even though the rebel proposal has been
virtually rejected as unconstitutional by President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and by the armed forces.
   Handal, a member of the Farabundo Marti general command, declared
on Monday that acceptance of the rebel offer would mean ``the end of
the armed struggle. In a permanent way.''
   He said failure to reach an accord would prompt a new wave of
violence in El Salvador.
   The U.S. State Department has said the plan is ``worthy of
serious and substantive consideration.'' Several U.S. legislators
said the guerrilla offer could be an important development in the
search for an end to the 9-year-old civil war, which has killed
about 70,000 people, mostly civilians.
   Handal and fellow commander Roberto Roca spoke to reporters
before the meeting began. No comment came from representatives of
the political parties.
   He said the elections did not have to be delayed until September,
but any postponement must be long enough ``for us to genuinely
participate in the elections.''
   Handal warned that without a postponement, ``there is no
possibility'' of an accord. He said the rebels rejected the
constitutional objections offered by Duarte and the armed forces,
even though the constitution says a new president must take office
on June 1.
   ``If there are elections on March 19, against the broad popular
will that has been formed in the country to support this opportunity
for peace, surely we will see much agitation among the people,'' the
guerrilla commander said.
   Asked if the rebels were willing to lay down their weapons,
Handal replied, ``The problem is not laying down arms. The problem
is resolving the armed conflict.''
   The fact that the meeting was taking place at all was considered
a victory for the guerrillas, who long sought direct talks with the
political parties.
   The site was the Hotel Tepozteco, part of a Mexican
government-run resort complex in Morelos state, about 40 miles
southeast of the Mexican capital. The meetings were to be held
Monday and Tuesday.
   Security was relaxed at the resort, which is dominated by the
picturesque, snowcapped volcanic peaks of Popocatepetl and
Iztaccihuatl.
   The talks were taking place against a background of rising
violence in El Salvador. The guerrillas mounted few attacks for
almost a month after they made their proposal, but broke the lull
late last week with attacks on six military installations.
   Representing the Farabundo Marti at the talks were two of its
military commanders and members of its diplomatic and political
commission.
   The right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, favored
to win the March 19 elections, was represented by its vice
presidential candidate, Francisco Merino. Eduardo Colindres,
Duarte's chief of protocol, represented the Christian Democratic
Party, which trails Arena in public opinion polls.
   The leftist Democratic Convergence, running a poor third
according to polls, was represented by its presidential candidate,
Guillermo Ungo, and party coordinator Ruben Zamora. Minor parties
were also represented.
   The guerrillas have said they will support the Convergence if
elections are delayed.
   Duarte and other Salvadoran politicians welcomed some elements of
the guerrilla proposal but said delaying elections would be
unconstitutional because Duarte's term is due to end on June 1.
   The armed forces have hinted that any effort to extend Duarte's
term unconstitutionally would be met with a coup.
   The guerrillas say the political parties, especially Arena, are
hiding behind the constitution to avoid substantive talks. Arena,
since it is leading according to the polls, has little incentive to
make concessions.

<HEAD>Engineer Charged as Serial Kidnapper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quiet engineer charged in three
kidnappings of young women led a double life, hiding his actions and
a stash of pornographic and criminal items from his family,
authorities say.
   Richard Daniel Starrett has been charged with kidnapping three
girls from this rural and suburban area west of Columbia, and
abducting and sexually assaulting a teen-ager in Georgia.
   Police say Starrett has led deputies to the body of one
kidnapping victim, Jeannie McCrea, 15, who was buried Sunday in
Columbia. Lexington County Sheriff James Metts said an autopsy
showed Miss McCrea was shot twice in the chest with bullets from a
.38-caliber gun matching one found in Starrett's possession, but no
murder charge had been filed as of Monday.
   Authorities in North Carolina, California, Florida and Tennessee
are looking at similarities in unsolved cases. Starrett, 29, was
being held pending a bond hearing in Lexington County.
   Starrett lived in Martinez, Ga., with a wife and year-old
daughter in a three-bedroom bungalow. But less than a mile away, he
stocked a mini-warehouse with pornographic and detective magazines
and criminal textbooks, investigators say. He kept a .38-caliber
revolver and used two aliases, according to Metts.
   When his wife and daughter flew to California to see her family,
Starrett assumed the role of serial kidnapper and sexual assailant,
Metts said.
   Starrett found victims by going to homes of people running ads
for used household goods. He took them to his home, chained them in
a closet, videotaped them and sexually assaulted at least two, Metts
says.
   ``This guy was leading a double life,'' Metts said. ``He was
leading one life where he was the family man, employed, known as
quiet and reserved, very smart, intellectual.
   ``On the other side, he was leading the life of a serial
kidnapper and sexual assaulter. He was fascinated by pornography. He
was fascinated by crimes of violence.''
   Starrett was arrested Tuesday night in Texas after a 17-year-old
told authorities she escaped from a kidnapper and led police to
Starrett's home in Martinez, Ga.
   Neighbors and colleagues knew Starrett as a quiet, friendly
design engineer at the Savannah River Plant in Aiken, S.C., a short
drive across the Georgia state line from his home.
   A native of Atlanta, he grew up as an Army child, living in
various U.S. cities and in Central America before his family settled
in Martinez in 1977. He studied at Augusta College, Georgia
Institute of Technology and San Jose University in California, where
he met his wife, Michele, Metts said.
   Hired in 1987 by Bechtel National Inc., a San Francisco-based
construction company, he was transferred last year to the South
Carolina plant, where Bechtel has a contract. Starrett moved back
home to Martinez.
   Unknown _ apparently even to his wife, Metts said _ he also
rented space at a warehouse complex. There, he hid what Metts
described as a ``personal library, boxes and boxes and boxes of
books, thousands of them.''
   There were books on how to change identity and how to investigate
crimes of missing children. There also were books on serial killer
Ted Bundy, who died Jan. 24 in the Florida electric chair.
   ``He was looking for ways to make his crimes look like missing
children cases instead of abductions,'' said Metts.
   On the day each of the three women was kidnapped, Starrett rented
a car. In at least two cases, he used an alias and drove 65 miles
east to Lexington County where he chose victims through a shopping
guide, Metts said.

<HEAD>Unvalidated Parking Ticket Leads To Big Withdrawal At Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A man upset when his bank wouldn't validate
his 50-cent parking ticket took his business _ at least $1 million
worth _ to the competitor, officials at both banks said.
   The manager of the main Seafirst Bank instructed tellers to be
kind to their new customer, John Barrier, in an account in the
bank's newsletter appearing this week.
   Barrier took $1 million out of Spokane's Old National Bank, now
U.S. Bank, in October when a teller and the manager refused to
validate his parking tab after he cashed a check.
   Barrier, 59, then deposited the funds at Seafirst.
   ``The first check he brought me was for a million dollars,'' said
Dennis Veter, vice president of Seafirst's main Spokane branch.
   David Samson, Seafirst's vice president for corporate affairs in
Seattle, said the story illustrated the importance of every customer.
   The Eastern Washington area manager for U.S. Bank, Phyllis
Campbell, confirmed Barrier's story and said it has prompted the
bank to review the way it does business.
   ``Every customer should be treated as a guest,'' she said.
   Barrier said a teller and a bank manager told him cashing a check
wasn't a transaction that qualified a customer for free parking.

   Geoff Upton, a former editor of the
Auckland Star decorated for his service to the newspaper industry,
has died at age 76, the New Zealand Press Association said Tuesday.
   Upton died Saturday, NZPA reported. The cause of death was not
given. Funeral services were to be held Tuesday in the North Island
town of Rotorua.
   Upton held a number of top management positions with newspapers
in New Zealand, including the chairmanship of New Zealand News Ltd.,
and NZPA.
   He worked as a reporter, assistant editor and financial editor at
the Auckland Star before being appointed editor in 1954.
   After his years as chairman of New Zealand News and NZPA, Upton
became a trustee of the London-based international news service
Reuters until his retirement in 1985.
   He gained his initial newspaper experience on the Glasgow Express
and the Daily Express in London before returning to New Zealand to
join the Christchurch Star-Sun in 1934.
   Later that year he was awarded the Order of the British Empire
for his service to the newspaper industry.
   During World War II Upton reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel
and commanded a battalion of the Fiji military forces on
Bougainville Island. The United States awarded him the Bronze Star
for heroism.
   He is survived by his wife, Heather, daughter Anne and sons John
and Bruce.

   A train hauling explosives and hazardous materials hit a broken
section of rail east of San Francisco, sending 48 cars off the
tracks Monday, and two ruptured tankers from a derailed train in
North Dakota spewed noxious gas.
   There were no reports of serious injuries in the derailments in
Manteca, Calif., and in Bordulac, N.D., officials said.
   At Manteca, a San Joaquin Valley town of 25,000, about three
dozen cars, including the four carrying the explosives, remained on
the tracks. Authorities said they asked residents to leave as a
precaution, although there was no fire or leak.
   The 100-150 residents who evacuated were expected to be allowed
back home by Tuesday morning. But police said it could take two days
to complete the cleanup.
   Nobody was injured when the train, en route from Houston to
Oakland, derailed just before 6 a.m., police said.
   Police Capt. Dennis Hoerth said the derailed cars included an
empty chlorine tanker and another car carrying an unspecified
hydrocarbon residue.
   The four cars carrying munitions were marked as containing Class
A projectile explosives, but neither Hoerth nor Southern Pacific
spokesman Jim Loveland knew specifically what types of munitions
were involved. The cars did not contain nuclear devices, Hoerth said.
   In Bordulac, in east-central North Dakota, the Soo Line train
derailed about 8:30 a.m., rupturing the two tanker cars, and sending
up a cloud of anhydrous ammonia gas.
   ``It looked like fog, very irritating to smell and breathe,''
said Lynn Schroeder, who was forced to leave his farm.
   Authorities did not know exactly how many people evacuated their
homes. No serious injuries were reported but hospital officials said
two people were admitted for observation after inhaling the gas.
   The major cloud from the leak was about 1\ miles wide and
traveled northeast for about 30 miles before it began to dissipate,
said Kevin Iverson, of the state division of emergency management in
Bismarck.

   More than 100 U.S. soldiers and
civilians were transferred out of off-base housing because the
Panamanian government's power company cut off their electricity, a
U.S. Army spokesman said Monday.
   The Army had not paid the power company $340,245 it owed in
electric bills since last April because of U.S. sanctions, Southern
Command spokesman Bill Ormsbee said. Instead, the money was
deposited into an account in New York.
   Sanctions imposed by former President Reagan forbid paying the
government controlled by armed forces commander Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle last year in
favor of Manuel Solis Palma.
   Southern Command transferred the residents of 80 rented homes in
Balboa and Diablo onto a U.S. military base near the Panama Canal,
Ormsbee said.
   He said the decision to make the transfer and terminate a rental
agreement for the homes was made Saturday after the government power
company cut the electricity.
   The housing in Diablo and Balboa was once part of the Panama
Canal Zone controlled by the United States, but was among the areas
that have reverted to Panamanian control under the Panama Canal
treaties of 1977.
   The United States still has about 13,000 troops in Panama but is
due to turn over its bases and full control of the canal at the end
of 1999.
   Delvalle tried to fire Noriega as commander of the Panamanian
Defense Forces last year after Noriega was indicted on
drug-trafficking charges in Florida.
   Instead, Noriega, who holds real power in Panama, got rid of
Delvalle.
   Noriega denied the drug charges and said that they and the effort
to oust him are part of a U.S. plot to violate the treaties and
maintain control of the canal.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as the legitimate
president of Panama, although he has had no power since Noriega
ousted him in February 1988.

   Military officials said they lifted an
8-year-old dusk-to-dawn curfew in northern Namibia on Monday, six
weeks before the formal start of the transition to independence.
   The South African-led territorial army gave as its reason a
virtual halt in military activities in the Ovamboland region by
guerrillas of SWAPO, the South-West African People's Organization.
   Ovamboland is the most populous region of Namibia, which South
Africa has administered since World War I.
   SWAPO, which has fought for independence since 1966, said in
October that its guerrillas had begun observing a unilateral
cease-fire. South African military officials say only a few SWAPO
attacks have occurred since then.
   However, the territorial army said SWAPO continued to maintain
bases in southern Angola in violation of a peace accord signed in
December by South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
   Under the agreement, Angola is to prevent SWAPO from maintaining
bases south of the 16th parallel, which lies 90 miles north of the
Angola-Namibia border.
   The territorial army quoted a recent SWAPO defector as saying
SWAPO still has six bases south of the 16th parallel. It said the
issue will be raised at a meeting among South African, Angolan and
Cuban officials on Wednesday.
   April 1 is the starting date for putting into effect a United
Nations plan to bring indepedence to Namibia.
   Two teams of U.N. officials are in Windhoek making preparations
for the transition process. One delegation is consulting on law
enforcement arrangements and the other is trying to find
accommodations for the 4,500-member U.N. monitoring force that will
begin arriving in April.
   The U.N. peacekeepers will be assigned to monitor independence
elections set for the first week of November. The actual date of
independence has not been set.

<TEXT>
   Flood-weary Kentucky got another soaking Monday as heavy rain
raised new fears of flash flooding, and many western Tennessee
rivers remained above flood stage and kept people from their homes.
   The National Weather Service predicted up to 3 inches of rain on
Kentucky through Wednesday morning and issued a flash flood watch
for the entire state, saying new rain could not be absorbed by the
already saturated ground, soaked by last week's heavy rain that
pushed rivers out of their banks.
   But rivers in western Kentucky posed the greatest problems
because of backwater flooding from the swollen Ohio River, officials
said.
   ``The Kentucky and Licking Rivers could take that precipitation
and not get back to flood stage, but the Salt and Green rivers are
still up in some places and are back up from the lower Ohio River,''
said Mike Murphy, a hydrologic technician at the weather service
office in Louisville.
   In western Tennessee, about 130 people were still unable to
return to their homes in Obion County, where nearly 400 were
displaced last week, said Cecil Whaley, an operations officer for
the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
   He said the Obion River was beginning to recede, but that another
inch or so of rain could send the water back into evacuated houses
and could cause flooding in some previously untouched places as well.
   Heavy rain was scattered over parts of western Tennessee during
the afternoon.
   Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter on Monday made Obion County the
ninth county for which he has requested federal federal disaster
assistance to allow low-interest loans for those affected by the
flooding, said spokesman Ken Renner.
   In other flooded areas, along the Cumberland River in central
Tennessee, people who evacuated their homes last week would probably
not be seriously affected by additional rain, Whaley said.
   ``In those places, an inch or two might not be too bad in their
situations,'' he said. ``It takes about 30 to 40 hours after the
rain hits for them to feel the effects on the Cumberland. If it only
lasts 24 hours ... it may not be too bad of an effect on them.''
   Along Kentucky's northern border, the Ohio River apparently
crested during the night at Louisville, 3-4 feet above flood level,
Murphy said.
   Also, the Western Kentucky Parkway was reopened early Monday,
said spokesman Don Armstrong of the state Division of Disaster and
Emergency Services. The parkway, the major highway from
Elizabethtown to Eddyville, had been closed by high water between
Elizabethtown and Leitchfield.

<DATELINE>HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Progressive Labor Party
on Monday demanded a public inquiry into a suspected violation of
foreign exchange control laws by a director of Bermuda's monetary
authority.
   Edgar Wilkinson, director of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, was
stopped Feb. 11 at Bermuda Airport as he was about to board a flight
to New York. Police seized some U.S. currency he was carrying but
did not bring charges.
   The Bermuda Monetary Authority is a semi-autonomous government
agency that performs the role of a central bank in the British
colony.
   Police have refused to confirm or deny reports that they are
investigating a possible breach of currency rules that forbid
Bermudians to take more than $5,000 abroad with them unless they
have received official permission.
   Wilkinson, thought to have committed a minor technical breach of
the regulations, is believed to have resigned from the authority
last week. The report has not been confirmed.
   Progressive Labor Party spokesman Julian Hall called for a
explanation of what he said was the ``apparent failure'' of the
police to follow standard procedure and open a case.
   Hall, a criminal lawyer, said the failure suggested that exchange
control regulations were being enforced against all except those
responsible for enforcing them.
   The Bermuda Monetary Authority has refused to comment on the
affair. But in launching a new series of banknotes Monday to mark
its 20th anniversary, the authority said the only bill not being
released was the $5 bill _ the only one of seven banknotes that was
to have carried Wilkinson's signature.
   The authority said a new $5 note would be issued later this year.
   Earlier, it issued an advance release showing the design of the
new bill complete with Wilkinson's signature and dated Feb. 20.
   Wilkinson flew to Australia Feb. 17 and is not expected to return
to Bermuda for about six weeks.
   Wilkinson, who was also treasurer to the governing United Bermuda
Party until his sudden resignation on Feb. 14, could pose the first
real political test of the new administration since the Feb. 9
general elections.
   The election saw the United Bermuda Party and Premier John Swan
returned to power but with considerably less popular support than
before and with fewer seats in the colony's Parliament.

   A plane flown by a student pilot wearing
blinders collided with another aircraft over the Adirondacks,
killing five people, including three youngsters on a birthday
outing, authorities said Monday.
   Bruce Parent, chief investigator for the Warren County Sheriff's
Department, said Monday the two planes ``glanced off of each other''
before crashing a mile apart in a logging area about 45 miles north
of Albany.
   Peter Murray, the pilot and lone survivor of the crash Sunday
afternoon, was learning to fly by instruments only and was wearing a
visor that permitted him to see no more than the dashboard, Parent
said.
   Murray, 64, told authorities his single-engine plane hit
something moments before it crashed, Parent said. He was was found
near the wreckage with severe burns and was in serious condition at
Cornell Medical Center in New York City.
   A Coast Guard plane using infrared search equipment found the
other plane, a single-engine aircraft dating from the 1940s, with no
survivors.
   Killed in that plane were pilot Loughran Boggs, 46, James Wells,
16, his 15-year-old sister, Jackie, and 12-year-old sister Rebecca.
Parent said Boggs had taken the youngsters on a flight in honor of
Jackie Wells' birthday.
   Murray's flight instructor, Willard Osterhout, 60, was pronounced
dead at the scene.
   Inspectors from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Tranportation Safety Board examined wreckage of the planes.
They said they expected to have a preliminary report out by the end
of the week, and that it would be six to eight months before the
investigation is completed.
   ``It's tough because of the extensive damage,'' said Reuben L.
Densley, an NTSB investigator.
   He said investigators didn't find any evidence of a visor, but
said it could have been destroyed in the fire.
   Pilots describe training with a visor as being ``under the
hood.'' They say it's a common training practice during which pilots
learn to rely on their instruments for times when they may encounter
poor visibility.
   Although the student pilot can only see the instrument panel, the
instructor has full view of the panel and what's outside the plane's
windshield.

<HEAD>Nakasone Denies Involvement In Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on Monday
denied direct involvement in the stock-profiteering scandal that is
threatening the government of his successor, Noboru Takeshita.
   Nakasone was premier from 1982-87, when the so-called Recruit
scandal was taking shape. The opposition has increasingly centered
its attacks on him in Parliament, but his first public comment came
late Monday in an interview with CBS television.
   ``I am not at all involved in such an affair as they allege,''
Nakasone replied when asked if he would testify before Parliament if
called.
   Nakasone said opposition questions on the scandal do not rest on
firm ground, but he said he would go along with Parliament and his
governing Liberal Democratic Party if summoned to testify.
   Earlier Monday, the opposition spelled out in Parliament its
suspicions of impropriety in the way the Recruit Co. bought a
U.S.-made supercomputer from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co.
during the Nakasone administration.
   Katsusuke Ozawa of the Japan Socialist Party said he suspected
Nakasone could have influenced the deal, which helped Recruit, an
information-based conglomerate, establish itself in the business of
leasing computer time and related telecommunications services.
   Nakasone is one of about 150 politicians, bureaucrats and
business leaders who benefited when Recruit distributed
bargain-priced shares in a Recruit subsidiary in 1986 before the
shares were listed for public sale. The shares more than doubled in
value, giving the holders fat profits. Three Nakasone aides
reportedly were among those who profited.
   Takeshita, who succeeded Nakasone in late 1987, has seen his
popularity slump and his party lose one local election after another
since the scandal broke last summer.
   Opposition parties demanded Monday that Takeshita submit
documents showing alleged trading by a former aide and a relative in
Recruit shares. But Takeshita declined to say in Parliament that he
would present the documents.
   Takeshita has pledged a broad effort to reform political ethics
before elections next July for half the seats in the upper house,
the House of Councilors, where the Liberal Democrats hold 143 of the
252 seats.
   Nakasone told CBS his party regretted that ``there may have been
a lack of cautiousness on our part and that we did not exercise due
oversight.''
   He added, ``But as far as we are concerned, while there may have
been a lack of oversight, it is not a criminal case.''
   No politicians have been arrested in the bribery probe, but eight
officials of Recruit, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and government
ministries have been taken into custody for questioning.
   Nakasone said the situation would become clearer as prosecutors
continue their work.
   ``I think we should wait for the results by the prosecutors and
then on the basis of that, address the matter accordingly,'' he said.

   A U.S. Navy captain
testified Tuesday he would have taken Vietnamese refugees aboard his
ship had he been correctly informed of how desperate they were.
   U.N. officials said the refugees later resorted to cannibalism to
survive.
   Capt. Alexander Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, has been on trial by
Navy court martial since Feb. 10 for allegedly failing to render
adequate assistance to more than 80 Vietnamese refugees whom his
ship, the USS Dubuque, encountered in the South China Sea on June 9.
   Thirty-one of the refugees died after encountering the Dubuque
and survivors resorted to cannibalism before they were rescued by
Filipino fishermen June 27 after 37 days at sea, U.N. officials said.
   His voice choked with emotion, Balian testified that he ordered
his executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley Halter, to investigate the
refugee boat, determine if it had a working engine and decide if it
was seaworthy.
   ``I never got an indication about that engine, so I said, `you
got to know about that engine,'' he said. ``Finally, the report came
back `no engine,' and I surmised they had a good sail.''
   Balian said he pressed Halter to recommend the vessel's
seaworthiness and was told ``they felt they could make it on their
own if we gave them food and water,'' which were provided.
   Balian said if he had known the desperate conditions aboard the
Vietnamese craft, ``there is no doubt in my mind I would tow them to
my side and embark them. That's what I did on two previous
occasions.''
   Balian was relieved of command of the Dubuque in August after the
Vietnamese reported the incident to U.N. officials in the
Philippines.
   On Thursday, Balian was acquitted of one of three charges _
failing to render assistance to a Vietnamese who drowned.
   The defendant on Tuesday also denied allegations that he ordered
crew members not to throw life rings to some of the Vietnamese who
swam toward the ship or to shake some of them from the ship's lines.
He said he did order an interpreter to tell swimmers to move away
for fear they would be sucked into the ship's propellers.
   Balian also denied previous testimony by a crew member, Chief
Petty Officer Luis Ilano, that he had advised the Vietnamese simply
to follow the sun to reach land.
   Balian said he ordered the Vietnamese interpreter to give the
refugees a navigational chart and mark their present position.

<HEAD>Student's Experiment to Fly on Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Brown University medical student's
experiment to see how the damaged bones of rats heal in space will
be launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery next month.
   ``I feel the experiment is going to provide hard, practical
information for understanding some of the problems of bone structure
in space,'' said Andre Fras, a second-year medical student, adding
it will address ``the pretty predictable possibility that somebody
will sustain some injury up there.''
   Fras, 21, won a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
contest to design an experiment to be flown aboard the shuttle in
1981, when he was in 10th grade.
   The experiment, along with another proposed by a student, is just
now getting off the ground. The explosion of the shuttle Challenger
in January 1986 delayed the launch of the rats, Fras said.
   Four caged rats, whose bones will be surgically cut, will be
checked to see if the bones have properly healed after spending five
days in space.
   ``I also feel that we know so little about the bone healing
process, even on Earth, that getting a new angle on that process
would be very valuable,'' Fras said.
   NASA is spending $88,000 to launch the rats. Fras is working with
researchers at the University of Southern California Orthopaedic
Hospital.
   Five days before the launch of Discovery, now set for mid-March,
Fras will fly to the Johnson Space Center in Houston to prepare the
rats. A small bone, less than the width of a pencil lead, will be
severed in each animal while the rats are under anesthesia, Fras
said.
   One group of rats remains on the ground as a control group, and
four others will be placed in a cage that automatically provides
food and water. The cage will be placed on the lower deck of the
shuttle, where the astronauts eat and sleep, said NASA spokeswoman
Billie A. Deason.
   After the shuttle lands, the rats will be killed with an overdose
of anesthesia so their bones can be examined.
   Bone deterioration in the weightlessness of space remains a major
roadblock to long-term missions, officials say. Soviet cosmonauts
who spent six months in space had to be removed from their
spacecraft on stretchers.
   Fras has won the Space Science Student Involvement Program twice.
His other experiment, launched in 1985, examined how brain cells age
in weightlessness.

<HEAD>Barenboim Conducts Concert Performance of Wagner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call it ``Tristan und Isolde und Daniel.''
   Daniel Barenboim, that is, whose superb conducting at Avery
Fisher Hall on Monday night surely gave him the right to equal
billing with the title characters of Richard Wagner's opera.
   Barenboim _ who has made news lately being both fired and hired
by music organizations _ led L'Orchestre de Paris in an unstaged
performance of Act 2 of the romantic epic.
   It was but one of three major operatic events performed around
town simultaneously _ a triple crown that made for one of those
``Only in New York'' evenings. Next door at the Metropolitan Opera,
a new production of Strauss' ``Salome'' was unfolding starring Eva
Marton, and 10 minutes away at Carnegie Hall, Riccardo Muti led the
Philadelphia Orchestra in a performance of Verdi's early opera
``Nabucco.''
   Those who chose ``Tristan'' were well rewarded. The opera's
middle act is in essence the musical depiction of passionate
lovemaking _ from anticipation to ecstasy to its aftermath _ and
Barenboim wrung every ounce of beauty and excitement from the score.
The orchestra, of which he is music director, played magnificently.
   Soprano Hildegard Behrens, who has performed the role of Isolde
at the Met, was in top form, meaning she hurled out the high notes
fearlessly and sang with beauty and expressiveness. Her Tristan was
Gary Lakes, a young Texan who has been rising quickly on the
international opera scene. Here was a rare tenor who sang rather
than barked the notes and didn't tire despite the strenuous demands
of the part.
   In supporting roles, mezzo Waltraud Meier was astonishing as
Brangaene, the faithful servant who tries in vain to warn the lovers
their tryst is about to be discovered. At only age 32, she seems
destined for a great career. Bass John Tomlinson was saddled with
the dreary role of King Marke, Isolde's husband. He used his
powerful, grainy voice to fairly strong effect in his 20-minute
soliloquy bemoaning his ill fortune.
   Barenboim, who is in his last season as head of L'Orchestre de
Paris, was fired earlier this year as musical and artistic director
at Paris' new Bastille Opera, losing a salary of $1.1 million over
four years.
   But he has just been named music director of the Chicago
Symphony, to replace Sir Georg Solti in September 1991.
   Pity Paris. Congratulations, Chicago.

<HEAD>Memorial Service Held At Bar For Poet Who Died Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 400 people crammed into a bar to pay
tribute to Everette Hawthorne Maddox, one of the city's most
acclaimed poets, who died homeless last week at age 44.
   A jazz band Sunday led the gathering of friends, poets and
college professors into the streets playing ``A Closer Walk With
Thee,'' ``Didn't He Ramble'' and ``Just a Little While to Stay
Here.''
   Maddox, who died Feb. 13 in Charity Hospital from complications
of alcoholism, was eulogized at the Maple Leaf Bar, where the former
university teacher had organized weekly poetry readings.
   Fred Kasten, a disc jockey at WWNO radio, talked of Maddox's
kindness, his self-effacing nature and his razor-sharp ability ``to
pop what was pompous and pretentious.''
   Kasten passed an empty beer pitcher for donations for Maddox's
cremation, with any surplus going to a shelter for the homeless.
   Bob Wolff, a boyhood friend from Alabama, quoted from a letter in
which Maddox said, ``My life is a museum of consolation prizes.''
   Maddox, whose writing was published in The New Yorker when he was
only 25, felt he failed to live up to that early success although he
published three volumes of poems, co-edited a poetry anthology and
had his work accepted by the Paris Review and North American Review.
   His work drew critical acclaim, but earned little money, and his
teaching career ended in 1978, when the University of New Orleans
laid him off during cutbacks. His marriage fell apart the same year,
Wolff recounted.
   Maddox once wrote a poem called ``Hypothetical Self-Epitaph'':
   ``What if I just caved in, gave out, pulled over to the side of
the road of life, expired like an old driver's license?
   ``You might say He didn't get far in 31 years. But I'd Say That's
all right, it was the world's longest trip on an empty tank.''

   A bomb exploded outside the offices
of Interior and Justice Minister Enrique Ortez Colindres on Monday,
a day after he ordered police occupation of a prison whose officials
are accused of corruption.
   No injuries were reported when the four sticks of dynamite
exploded at 7:10 p.m., damaging the building and shattering the
windows of the Honduran Telecommunications Co. building across the
street, police sources said.
   No one immediately claimed responsiblity.
   Police on Sunday occupied the nation's largest prison after the
government accused prison officials of corruption, drug trafficking
and trying to foment a riot by 1,500 inmates, officials said Monday.
   The Public Security Forces said in a statement that it had
detected ``a dangerous escalation of sedition and rioting that would
have occurred today (Monday) with the alleged participation of
several officials of the Central Penitentiary'' in Tegucigalpa, the
capital.
   It said prison officials and ``highly dangerous delinquents''
were planning a riot ``that would produce a massive escape of
prisoners in detriment to national security and tranquility.''
   Ortez Colindres told The Associated Press he temporarily
suspended prison director Marco Tulio Mendieta. Ortez Colindres said
he named Maj. David Mendoza Garcia, schooled in prison
administration in Argentina, as the facility's acting director.
   The police statement said an investigation detected ``an elevated
and proven administrative corruption, trafficking in drugs, sales of
exit permits to very dangerous criminals, incitements to armed
revolt by the guards, an indiscriminate possession of arms inside
the prison,'' and other irregularities.
   More than 200 members of the crack Cobra police squadron occupied
the facility late Sunday, it said. The measures were taken to ensure
public order, and 60 prison guards and officials were arrested, it
said.
   Officials said the takeover was peaceful and reported no
casualties.
   The Central Penitentiary houses inmates convicted of violent
crimes, including homicide, rape and drug trafficking.

   President Bush on Monday concluded after
reading a final FBI report on embattled Defense Secretary-designate
John Tower that there was nothing in the files to derail Tower's
nomination, the White House said.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush went over the
140-page report on Tower, a former U.S. senator from Texas, during
an Oval Office meeting with White House counsel C. Boyden Gray.
   Gray went to Capitol Hill late Monday to present the report to
Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., the ranking members
of the Armed Services Committee.
   ``The report shows no reason why Sen. Tower should not be
confirmed, in our judgment,'' Fitzwater told reporters as the dinner
hour approached.
   ``The president urges that Sen. Tower be confirmed as soon as
possible,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We'll let the senators read the report and make their own
judgment,'' the press secretary said.
   Fitzwater said the FBI report was ``very exhaustive'' and said
that the document was sent unaltered to the Armed Services Committee
leaders.
   ``It did not corroborate the personal charges (of womanizing and
excessive drinking) against the senator, nor did it show any
problems with illegal campaign contributions,'' Fitzwater told
reporters.
   He said that Nunn and Warner are welcome to ``keep the report and
read it at their convenience,'' but made it clear the White House
believes that Tower's nomination should be recommended favorably by
the committee and approved by the full Senate.
   Fitzwater said that Gray phoned Bush at Camp David, Md., in the
early afternoon and discussed the report briefly with the president,
and then had a fuller discussion with Bush in the Oval Office.
   On his return to the White House from the presidential retreat,
Bush gave a thumbs-up sign when asked about Tower's prospects. But
the president did not comment.
   Fitzwater said the report focused ``on the last remaining
allegations'' against Tower. He said that Bush ``agreed with
Boyden's conclusion that there was no reason in that report that
Sen. Tower should not be confirmed.''
   Nunn and Warner met into the night after Gray delivered the
report and later avoided reporters as he left.
   ``There's a lot to go over,'' Warner said as he made one of
several trips between the committee office and his own office.
   Spokesmen for both Nunn and Warner said the senators would have
nothing further to say for the night.
   The report examined allegations on Tower's drinking habits,
female companions and campaign contributions, according to unnamed
White House officials cited in Tuesday's editions of The New York
Times. The report said no evidence of misbehavior was found,
although it did say Tower had a drinking problem in the early 1970s
that came about after his first marriage broke up.
   Earlier, Armed Services Committee staff members met with Berne
Indahl, a State Department security officer sent to Geneva in 1986
to investigate allegations of security breaches in the U.S.
delegation to missile talks with the Soviet Union while Tower was a
member of the contingent, said congressional sources who requested
anonymity.
   On Sunday, Indahl had spoken to investigators of a House
subcommittee about a separate inquiry that had turned up allegations
against Tower. At that meeting, the sources said, Indahl
corroborated a report that Tower, while in Geneva, had used his
secretaries as mistresses.
   The sources would not go into detail on what Indahl told the
House committee.
   The FBI presented its latest report on allegations into Tower's
personal and business affairs to Gray early Monday afternoon. Bush
was briefed on the new report, said White House sources, who
requested anonymity.
   The committee may vote this week on the embattled nomination, but
Nunn and Warner said they will not schedule a vote ``until all the
evidence is in.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, promised a
speedy vote on the nomination once it leaves the committee.
Mitchell, interviewed over the weekend, said that he has not read
the FBI reports but that the allegations surrounding Tower's private
life are ``an appropriate subject of inquiry'' because of the
importance of the defense post.
   Not so, said Senate minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who told
reporters Sunday he has read the earlier FBI reports, seen nothing
that would disqualify Tower and suggested moving ahead on the
nomination.
   ``I think we should stop checking every rumor. Unless there's
some criminal activity, let's get on with the vote,'' Dolesaid.
   While eleven of President Bush's choices for Cabinet posts have
sailed through the confirmation process, Tower's selection ran into
a maelstrom fueled by rounds of allegations about the former
senator's personal and business affairs.
   Charges surfaced that Tower drinks excessively and is a
womanizer. Many senators also expressed concerns about their former
colleague's close ties to defense contractors. Tower received more
than $1 million as a consultant for major defense firms since he
left the Senate in 1985.
   Meanwhile, a House subcommittee continued its investigation into
security at nuclear weapons facilities run by the Energy Department
_ an inquiry that has turned up allegations about Tower.
   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations obtained parts of an Office of Personnel Management
report on a probe into the activities of a U.S. arms control
delegation in Geneva while Tower served as a negotiator.
   For seven hours Sunday, the subcommittee questioned Indahl, who
corroborated the allegations against Tower and ``brought the whole
thing into focus,'' said a congressional source.
   Indahl is scheduled to go before the panel again in an executive
session on Wednesday. The committee is chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich.
   Also scheduled to testify is John Grassle, who allegedly made the
charges against Tower to Indahl. Grassle was quoted last week by
Knight-Ridder as saying he did not make such allegations.
   From January 1985 to April 1986, Tower served as a negotiator for
the U.S. delegation at talks with the Soviet Union on long-rang
missile reductions.
   Nunn has said an investigation of Tower's actions in Geneva found
no security breaches.
   Last week, Nunn raised the possibility that if senators raise
questions about Tower's personal life the lawmakers have to meet in
a rare closed session.
   ``I hope not, but it depends on the type of questions posed on
the Senate floor by senators who are not members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee,'' he said.
   A closed session of the full Senate is highly unusual, occurring
on average about once a year and usually relating to national
security issues. The last closed session was March 29, 1988, when
the Senate met to discuss the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
Treaty with the Soviet Union.
   In other matters on Capitol Hill this week:
   _The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee is to take up Bush's
nomination of Edward J. Derwinski to head the new Department of
Veterans Affairs.
   _The president's fiscal 1990 budget will be up for discussion
when House and Senate leaders visit the White House on Tuesday. The
same day, Richard Darman, the president's budget director, launches
a week of budget testimony on Capitol Hill by administration
officials.

   A freshman legislator said Monday he will
challenge the seating of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke
when the Legislature convenes in a special session this week.
   In Metairie, the nearly all-white suburb of New Orleans where
Duke was elected, a lawyer who convened a private meeting Monday
night said that a group of citizens would sue, questioning Duke's
residency, if the legislator's challenge failed.
   ``The ultimate decision has been deferred until tomorrow,''
lawyer David Sherman said after the meeting, declining to say how
many attended. ``It appears that there will be a legislative
challenge. In my opinion that would be a better forum. If we feel
the matter will not be heard there, we will file suit.''
   Duke, 38, defeated homebuilder and longtime Republican John
Treen, 63, in Saturday's election for a seat in the Louisiana House
despite endorsements for Treen from President Bush, former President
Reagan and powerful political figures in suburban New Orleans.
   Workers at Duke's headquarters said he could not be reached for
comment on the challenge.
   Rep. Odon Bacque, the only registered independent in the House,
said he will challenge Duke's seating on grounds that Duke did not
live in the district for a year, as required by law.
   Opponents said utility records showed Duke's condominium had no
electricity for the first six months he said he lived there. They
noted papers he filed during his 1988 presidential campaign listed a
different address, outside the district.
   Duke has said he did indeed live in the district and on Sunday
dismissed further questions as frivolous.
   Opponents were unable to get Duke's name off the ballot before
the election because state law limits such challenges to 10 days
after a candidate signs up to run. Duke is scheduled to be sworn-in
on Wednesday.
   Bacque said several legislators have tried to persuade him to
change his mind because the publicity would hurt the state. ``Some
things are right and some things are wrong,'' he said. ``I have no
problem with him being elected if he did it the right way.''
   Rep. Avery C. Alexander, a civil rights leader and past president
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said Monday that he
planned to meet with Duke to discuss his legislative plans before
deciding whether to back any challenge.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Buddy Roemer, in his first public statement on
the election, said it reflected the will of the voters in the
district.
   ``In a democracy, that fact must be respected regardless of what
one might think personally about David Duke's philosphical
principles,'' he said.
   ``While I don't agree with him philosophically, he is only one
member of a 144-member legislative body and has the obligation to
his constituents to act responsibly within that body.''
   The two-week special session was called by Roemer to deal with
the state's financial problems.

<TEXT>
   A line of severe storms moved through
central Louisiana on Monday, spawning tornadoes that touched down in
three areas, along with drenching rains, officials said.
   Tornadoes hit Alexandria and Pineville in Rapides Parish and
Jonesville in Catahoula Parish, downing power lines, toppling trees,
and damaging buildings and trailers, officials said. There were no
reports of serious injuries.
   ``Tornadoes hit in about seven different locations here in
Rapides Parish,'' said Bill Godron, the local Civil Defense
director. ``We've also had a great deal of flooding throughout the
entire area. We've had to evacuate some people to shelters and we
had to close one of the shelters because it was flooding.''
   He was unable to say how many people were forced from their
homes, but at least one mobile home was demolished.
   Rainfall measured from 3 to 7 inches in the area, Godron said.
   ``The flooding varies from knee high to waist high,'' he said.
``These are low lying areas where flooding isn't all that unusual,
but on top of everything else today, it's a mess.''
   Officials said two shelters remained open Monday night, but it
was not immediately known how many people stayed there.
   Several tornadoes were sighted, the first was seen just after
12:30 p.m. west of Alexandria, moving in a northeastern direction,
officials said.
   ``It got real dark and it started making that roaring noise,''
said one resident, Ellen Minges. The twister uprooted two large
trees at her house.
   Severe thunderstorms developed Monday over the lower Mississippi
Valley, said the National Weather Service.
   A tornado watch was in effect for several hours over much of
northern and western Louisiana, a small part of southeastern and
east-central Texas and a small part of western Mississippi, the
service said.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has spurned British author Salman
Rushdie's apology for offending Moslems with his novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' and declared it every Moslem's duty to ``send him to hell.''
   Iran's fundamentalist patriarch's statement Sunday appeared to
exclude the possibility that the dispute over the book many consider
to blaspheme Islam can be settled through negotiation.
   Khomeini's death decree Tuesday compelled the novelist to go in
hiding under police guard in Britain _ a $5.2 million bounty placed
on his head by Iranian clerics _ and has threatened to sour
improving relations between Iran and some Western governments.
   The death decree also named Rushdie's publishers, and copies of
the novel have been removed from some bookstores' shelves in the
United States and Japan. Fearing attacks, some Western publishers
have decided not to print the book.

   Just days after anti-apartheid

killed a young black, police raided her home, arrested four men and
reportedly found bloodstains.
   State-run Radio South Africa said the four men arrested in

   ``We have found fingerprints and blood samples which will be

   He said police would try to prove in court that some young men

world's two largest economies have subsided.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, the United State's main ally
in Asia, remains more than $50 billion a year, has begun inching
downward and the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the
Japanese yen appears to be at a stable level.
   ``Things are rather harmonious at the moment,'' said John
Williamson, an analyst at the Institute for International Economics.
   ``The United States is pleased with the recent steps taken by
Japan. The Japanese may not be as pleased with U.S. progress on
lowering the budget deficit, but not so much that it will be an area

   One frustrated American participant said Doe could not be
persuaded to abandon his practice of maintaining an extracurricular

   The premature termination roughly halfway into the two-year
project, coming as it does on the heels of a congressional freeze on
aid to Liberia, may be prompting Doe into action.

   A study in which students carried electronic

glimpse into the adolescent psyche and indicates some stereotypes
are false, researchers say.
   University of Illinois and Loyola University researchers gave
beepers to 480 students in grades five to nine in suburbs southwest
of Chicago and asked them to write down their thoughts when buzzed
every two hours or so.
   The results: 20,000 musings on adolescent concerns ranging from
television to love, including the finding that most youths felt best
doing sports and worst doing homework.
   ``We hope that this study will not merely be 20,000 individual
snapshots, but rather a motion picture of what life as an adolescent
is actually like,'' the researchers write in an article accepted for
publication in the journal Child Development this September.

   European Common Market governments decided Monday to withdraw
their top diplomats from Iran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's renewed order for Moslems to kill novelist Salman
Rushdie. Britain went further by pulling out its entire embassy
staff.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the death threats
against Rushdie and the publishers of ``The Satanic Verses'' for
allegedly blaspheming Islam were ``unwarranted interference'' in
Britain's internal affairs.
   The 12 European Economic Community governments, in a sharp blow
to Iran's hopes of improving relations with Western nations, decided

   A government report released Monday calls for a
``radical reshaping'' of U.S. foreign assistance programs because
current aid concepts are based on a world that no longer exists.
   ``The challenges of today's problems, and tomorrow's, cannot be
met with yesterday's solutions, suitable as they may have been to
yesterday's problems,'' said the report, issued by the administrator
of the Agency for International Development, Alan Woods.
   The 158-page study said the aid program no longer seems able to
fulfill its original mandate of helping poor countries achieve the
transition from dependency to self-sufficiency.
   Somewhere between 1949 and the present, the concept of aid as a
transitional means of helping countries become self-sufficient was
lost, it said.

   A jury will be sworn in Tuesday in the trial of
Oliver North, with the prosecution preparing a lineup of witnesses
to testify he tried to cover up the Iran-Contra affair.
   Lawyers for the fired presidential aide plan to rebut the
prosecution's case by showing North had White House authorization
for his activities. North, the key figure in the Iran-Contra affair,
was indicted 11 months ago with former national security adviser
John Poindexter and businessmen Richard Secord and Albert Hakim.
   The latter three will be tried separately.
   Two central charges against North, accusing him of conspiracy and
theft in diverting Iranian arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan
guerrillas, were thrown out last month on national security grounds.

   Ranking members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee met Monday with a government investigator who once probed
the conduct of an arms talks delegation that included John Tower as
the White House delivered to the panel the latest FBI report on the
defense secretary-designate.
   Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and ranking Republican John Warner of
Virginia interviewed Berne Indahl, a State Department security
officer sent to Geneva in 1986 by the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency to investigate allegations of security breaches, said
congressional sources who requested anonymity.
   On Sunday, Indahl had spoken to investigators of a House
subcommittee about a separate inquiry that had turned up allegations
against Tower. At that meeting, the sources said, Indahl
corroborated a report that Tower, while in Geneva, had used his
secretaries as mistresses.

   Are the spotted owls that live in the ancient
forest of the Northwest really endangered or are they being
victimized by the miniature radio transmitters that scientists use
to track their movements?
   Biologists now are debating that question as a result of an
unexpectedly high mortality rate among young owls outfitted with
radio transmitters. The scientists are also trying to determine
whether the devices interfere with adult owls' ability to reproduce.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Since the early 1980s, wildlife biologists have been strapping
transmitters weighing about 20 grams, or about as heavy as two
quarters, on the backs of both juvenile and adult owls.
   If the transmitters are harming the owls, then studies that
concluded the owls may be a threatened or endangered species could
be based on faulty data, said Hal Salwasser, deputy director of
wildlife and fisheries at the U.S. Forest Service.
   ``We are very much concerned,'' said Salwasser. ``Many scientists
believe we may have a problem.''

   Ronald Reagan's White House physician said
Monday he now believes that executive power should have been
transferred to then-Vice President George Bush after Reagan was shot
in 1981.
   Dr. Daniel Ruge said that in hindsight, the emergency provisions
of the 25th Amendment allowing for the transfer of authority should
have been invoked after the March 1981 assassination attempt.
   The doctor, now living in retirement in Denver, said ``I knew all
about'' the 25th Amendment, ``but it never occurred to me'' to
suggest to Reagan's aides that it be invoked.
   As White House physician, he kept a copy of the 25th Amendment in
his bag, Ruge said in a telephone interview from his home.
   But in the hours after Reagan was shot in the chest by John W.
Hinckley Jr. outside a Washington hotel on March 30, 1981, Ruge said
he was preoccupied with the president's condition.

   Donald Trump can buy hotels, he can buy football
teams, he can buy casinos and airlines. But he can't buy respect.
   Spy magazine calls him a ``short-fingered vulgarian.'' Cartoonist
Berke Breathed takes Trump's brain and installs it in the skull of
Bill the Cat, the foul feline of ``Bloom County.'' A Daily News
columnist writes that when she needs cheering up, she watches
``Donald Trump do something silly.''
   The Stand Up New York comedy club devoted a night to ridiculing
Trump. For two hours, comics drew laughter with readings from
``Trump: The Art of the Deal'' and took their own potshots _
suggesting, for example, that he bought a Parisian landmark and
renamed it the ``Arc de Trump.''
   The 43-year-old billionaire does not believe he deserves this
tidal wave of derision, which rises along with his success and
prominence. But Trump _ who declined to be interviewed _ thinks he
understands it.
   ``Those who don't like me don't know me, and have never met me,''
he told Time magazine. ``My guess is that they dislike me out of
jealousy.''
   Not so, say Trump's detractors. They dislike him on merits.
   ``He's just an everyday slob with too much money. He just doesn't
have enough taste to keep his name off of things,'' said Breathed.

   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush went over the

   Gray went to Capitol Hill late Monday to present the report to

<TEXT>
   Danny Bonaduce used to have a rule: no
autographs while he's eating. Times change, and so does the
celebrity, the former ``Partridge Family'' star has learned.
   In the 14 years since he stopped playing the smart-aleck Danny
Partridge, autograph hounds have been few, and Bonaduce finds that
he welcomes them: ``Come up and you can have my dinner and I'll sign
for you.''
   At 29, Bonaduce is back with his wisecracks and a deeper voice as
a late-night disc jockey on WEGX-FM, the Philadelphia market's
hottest rock station.
   ``I'm real visible in Philadelphia, and I like it,'' said
Bonaduce, a media hit these days. ``I love being here and getting
all this attention. I'm totally into this.''
   So is the station.
   ``The man has contributed in publicity more than any disc jockey
on any radio station I've ever seen,'' said WEGX programming
director Charlie Quinn, who put Bonaduce on the air Dec. 5 with no
experience, but with another deejay around to help out.
   Less than three months into his first radio job, Bonaduce is No.
2 in his 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. slot, which he opens each night with the
``Partridge Family'' theme song _ under orders, he says.
   He's not the pudgy little kid he once was, but the trademark red
hair and familiar features make it easy to identify Bonaduce, who
turned to TV and radio guest appearances and restaurant work after
his ``Partridge Family'' days.
   The ``Partridge Family'' ran on ABC-TV from 1970-74, and starred
Shirley Jones as the head of a family that becomes a rock 'n' roll
band. The show also featured Susan Dey and David Cassidy.
   On the air, while still trying to master the technical equipment
surrounding him, he lives off his wit.
   ``Often as not it ain't funny, but too bad. I don't want to have
a fake show,'' he said.
   Recently divorced, he called his ex-wife in Los Angeles his first
night on the job _ on the air.
   ``I called her up and demanded custody of the dog,'' he said.
``She didn't find the humor.''
   Since then, he's held a Ted Bundy request hour the night the
serial killer was executed in Florida _ receiving such song ideas as
``Hurts So Good'' and ``Shock the Monkey.''
   Yes, he's heard from the front office a couple times.
   ``I've had to tone it down by request,'' Bonaduce said. ``I'm not
anywhere near the hit that I'm unfireable.''
   ``He definitely jumps off the edge (on) some things,'' Quinn
said. ``The man obviously never knew who the FCC is.''
   Few begin a deejay career in a market this size, Quinn said, but
Bonaduce offered the station publicity and is regarded as a serious
member of the WEGX lineup.
   ``I think they hired me at first because I'd be interesting,''
Bonaduce said. ``Now I've got a semipopular show on my hands.''
   Bonaduce actually had been looking for deejay work among the
stations on which he did guest shots. There were no takers.
   ``They apparently thought I couldn't pull it off,'' he said.
   The key, Quinn said, is that most stations thought about Bonaduce
stepping into an all-comedy role.
   ``I took it a different direction,'' Quinn said. ``I put him into
a nighttime disc jockey role and actually trained him to be a disc
jockey first and a celebrity-comedian second. So far I think that
he's coming along real nicely. He's gotten better and better by the
day.''
   He's still new enough at it that he takes an exaggerated bow to a
studio visitor after ending one song and starting another smoothly
on the air. He gets a reassuring word from his fiancee, Debbie
Strauss, with whom he became engaged this month. She sometimes helps
in the studio _ even though she hates his ``Date the DJ'' contest on
Thursday nights, when he records and airs women's calls with ideas
for a hot date, such as being buried in chocolate-chip cookies.
   Bonaduce knows he has work ahead.
   ``There's more to learn. There's more finesse. ... The finesse I
certainly don't have down,'' he said.
   He's also not kissing off television. His five-year run as Danny
Partridge ended at age 15. Rerun royalties ended seven years later.
   ``I've been on `The Love Boat' a lot. When `The Love Boat' went
off the air, my future looked dim,'' he said wryly.
   ``I'd love to do some good television but I don't think I'd give
up radio to do it. I think I can combine the two.''
   Whatever other radio stations thought, he's pulling it off.
   ``The show's a hit and I'm the happiest I've ever been.''

<HEAD>Soviet Jews Wait and Hope in Italy to Get to America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LADISPOLI, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gennady Resnikov waited nine years to get
out of the Soviet Union. Now he is in Italy, waiting to get to the
United States.
   Resnikov is a new arrival in this seaside, working-class town
where about 5,000 other Soviet Jews wait to get U.S. visas. He is
optimistic.
   ``It is my great luck that I have things that other people don't
have,'' he said.
   He has American newspaper clippings that identify him as a
refusenik and critic of the Kremlin _ proof, he hopes, that he
merits refugee status and a visa.
   Still, Resnikov and the others know that there are too many of
them and too few visas.
   ``I struggled for nine years to get out. I struggled, fought and
organized many demonstrations,'' said Resnikov, an electro-chemist
from Moscow.
   ``We organized so many news conferences. My American friends told
us we were so brave. Now I have to prove my past.''
   Once permission to go to the United States was almost automatic
for Soviet Jews. But Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who came to power in
1985, opened the tap on what had been just a trickle of Jewish
emigration from the Soviet Union.
   Relief officials say the number of Soviet Jews passing through
Italy, the main processing point for Soviet refugees to America,
rose from 600 in 1986 to 17,000 last year. Officials say 38,000 to
50,000 will come this year.
   The United States has agreed to accept 24,500 refugees from all
of Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. However, others will
be accepted if they find sponsors in the United States.
   ``The main idea is waiting and waiting, hoping something will
change, that the American government will change its mind,'' said
Sam Nimeroski, 60, who arrived in late November and has been
rejected twice for an American visa.
   Many of the 5,000 Soviet Jews currently in Ladispoli and about
2,000 in other towns near Rome will get U.S. visas.
   Meanwhile, most live only on the money they get from the American
Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a private Jewish relief
organization. But it is running out of money.
   Nimeroski said he, his wife Ludmilla and their 3-year-old son
Stanislav receive the equivalent in Italian lire of about $593 a
month. Of that, they pay $407 rent for a three-room apartment shared
with two other families, 10 people in all.
   Compared to other refugees the Soviet Jews in Ladispoli live
pretty well, say officials of the Joint Distribution Committee. They
live in apartments, rather than camps or cheap hotels. They have a
community center and their own schools where classes are taught in
Russian. An old movie house near the center of town has been
converted into a synagogue.
   Some food stores post signs in Russian, and a few merchants have
learned some Russian phrases.
   But Deputy Mayor Enzo Paliotta says the refugees have overtaxed
public services in this town of 16,500, about 25 miles from Rome.
   Silvia Hassenfeld, president of the joint committee, said the
organization has temporarily stopped sending refugees here because
of that.
   While they wait, scores of Soviets gather each day near the
fountain in the central Piazza Vittoria.
   ``Among our people there is only one topic, leaving for
America,'' said Mrs. Nimeroski. ``It is very difficult to talk about
this all day because it is a very unpleasant topic.''
   Relief officials say they have no other appeal if they are turned
down for a visa, and their only recourse is finding a sponsor in
America.
   ``I have no relatives in the United States. Nobody will pay for
me,'' said Nimeroski, who was an educational administrator in
Tashkent.
   He said he was persecuted as a Jew in the Soviet Union but
believes U.S. officials rejected him because he had been a Communist
Party member.
   ``They told me, `You were never in Siberia. Nobody beat you. You
are not a refusenik, you are just a man.'
   ``I couldn't live in the country as a Jew,'' said Nimeroski. ``I
escaped from this country. What is my blame?''
   All the Jewish refugees could go easily to Israel under the Law
of Return, said Uri Benzion, the distribution committee's director
of educational and social life programs here.
   But Benzion and others say many of the refugees know almost
nothing about the Jewish faith and feel no special tie to Israel.
   Italy has no limit on how long they can stay, but it accepts them
on condition they will eventually move on. They are not allowed to
get jobs while in teh country, however.
   Some Soviet Jews who have failed to get U.S. visas apply to go to
other countries. Some select Australia or Canada while others might
seek entry into another West European country.
   Because the distribution committee is running out of money, it is
considering options other than the arrangement in Ladispoli, such as
refugee camps, and is asking the refugees to seek financial help
from friends and relatives.
   ``We are also suggesting to them that Israel is a very viable
option,'' said Ms. Hassenfeld.

<HEAD>Portuguese Administration of Macao Has Grand Plans for Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MACAO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   History long ago passed Macao by, but the Portuguese
administrators of this speck on China's southern coast have grand
plans for the final decade of their rule.
   They talk enthusiastically of transforming Macao with the
addition of an international airport and other major construction
before the Portuguese flag is lowered in 1999 and sovereignty
returns to China. Critics wonder, however, if the projects are
feasible.
   Macao was settled in 1557 as the first European foothold in East
Asia and for generations the main entrepot for Western trade with
China. Now it exists in the shadow of Hong Kong, the thriving
British colony 40 miles to the northeast.
   As Hong Kong parlayed its spectacular deepwater harbor to become
one of the great shipping and financial centers of the world,
Macao's own waters filled up with silt. A fleet of hydrofoils,
jetfoils and ferries that connects the two colonies provides the
only practical transportation links to Macao.
   The Portuguese enclave has evolved into a gamblers' paradise with
several casinos, a jai alai palace, and tracks for dog and horse
racing. It also manufactures textiles, toys and artifical flowers
for export.
   Despite a smattering of new hotels and office towers, Macao
retains the flavor of the Old World, with its numerous rundown
colonial-style buildings.
   But on the drawing board for the six-square-mile territory is
construction of the international airport, a new harbor and a new
town for Macao's two sleepy islands of Taipa and Coloane. After
years of talk, the government says work is finally starting.
   The projects are designed to ``prepare some stability in Macao
(before) and after 1999,'' when the enclave becomes a special
administrative region of China, said Undersecretary for Major
Projects Luis Macedo Pinto de Vasconcelos.
   In negotiations with Portugal that concluded two years ago,
Beijing promised Macao can maintain its capitalist system for 50
years and maintain a high degree of autonomy after 1999. A similar
arrangement has been made for Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
   The new projects also should help this territory of about 500,000
people (only about 10,000 of them Portuguese) ``have its own
identity and not have such a dependence on Hong Kong,'' Vasconcelos
said.
   The key to Macao's plans is the airport, which will have a single
runway either on landfill or piling set in the ocean. Work is set to
begin this spring and the $450-million first phase is scheduled for
completion in 1993 with the capacity to handle 3 million passengers
a year, Vasconcelos said in an interview.
   He added that the airport will increase the flow of tourism and
help integrate Macao with the adjacent Pearl River delta, one of
China's most prosperous regions.
   But international airports already exist in Hong Kong and the
Chinese city of Canton, about 100 miles to the north. The nearby
Chinese special economic zone of Shenzhen also is building an
airport.
   The Hong Kong airport, which handled 15.3 million passengers last
year and is fast reaching its capacity of 20 million, is widely
expected to be replaced by a larger facility in about a decade.
   Alexandre Ho and Leung Kam Chun, two of the six elected members
in the Legislative Assembly of Macao, believe an airport in Macao
may be nothing more than a flight of fancy.
   ``Personally, I am not sure we will have enough passengers to
maintain that airport,'' said Ho. ``I'm doubtful whether we will
have enough passengers to keep it running.''
   Of the nearly 5.1 million tourists who arrived in Macao during
the first 11 months of 1988, four-fifths were Hong Kong residents.
   Ho maintained the Portuguese would do better to focus on
improving education, medical services and social security.
   Many of the local Chinese have long questioned Portugal's
commitment to the colony's people. Fifteen years ago, Portugal
offered to return the enclave to China, but Beijing declined without
saying why.

<TEXT>
   Station 35,000 American troops in Okinawa, one
of Japan's smallest and most densely populated prefectures, and you
get some friction when shoulders start rubbing.
   To farmers in Chatan, proximity means working small plots right
up against the barbed-wire-tipped fences of the U.S. Kadena Air Base.
   To elementary school children in Futenma, it means looking up
from a playground and seeing cargo planes making their final
approach to a U.S. Marine Corps landing strip.
   Local residents and the U.S. military are so close that Kadena
officials have received complaints from a used car dealer who said
his newly waxed automobiles were dirtied by a breeze carrying water
used to wash military jets.
   And the noise.
   ``It's really terrible,'' said Ieko Arakaki, an employee at
Kadena City Hall, only 150 feet from the base perimeter. ``All our
windows are soundproof, but they still rattle.''
   Arakaki said microphones have been placed on the roof to record
decibel levels, and a 24-hour hotline was set up in October so
townspeople could voice their complaints.
   U.S. spokesmen agree that it can be tough, but they don't see an
alternative to bases and training on this famous World War II
battleground.
   ``It's like taking all the airstrips in Texas and putting them in
Connecticut,'' said Paul Berger, civilian chief of Kadena's
community relations.
   Bordering on the base's fences are Okinawa City, population
110,000; Chatan, 19,000, and Kadena, 14,000. Seventy-five percent of
Okinawa City lies within base perimeters.
   Kadena, home of 9,200 servicemen and the largest tactical fighter
wing in the U.S. Air Force, is only one of 45 American facilities in
Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture composed of about 60
islands.
   Nearly two-thirds of the prefecture's 1.2 million people are
crowded into the southern third of Okinawa Island, the main island.
Naha, Okinawa's capital, is 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   ``Encroachment is about as bad as it can get,'' said Lt. Col.
Robert Winkelmann, head of Kadena's Public Affairs Office.
   Winkelmann said the average number of takeoffs and landings at
the base is 1,570 a week, but that traffic is directed over the sea
or away from populated areas whenever possible.
   ``We live here too, and we know what the noise is like,'' he
said. ``But wherever you have planes there's going to be noise.''
   By far the most conspicuous force is the 24,000-member Marine
Corps, which has eight major camps covering 15 percent of the
roughly 70-mile-long island.
   ``This is the largest concentration of Marines outside the
U.S.,'' said Maj. James Vance, public affairs officer. He pointed
out that roughly one in every 10 Marines is stationed on Okinawa.
Smaller Army and Navy units are also based here.
   Vance said that because of Okinawa's size, more than 90 percent
of the training with live ammunition is conducted elsewhere, often
in South Korea, the Philippines or Australia.
   ``We could put a howitzer in the sea on one side of the island
and shoot it into the water on the other side,'' he said, adding
that because of the lack of space, tanks fire into tunnels dug into
hills in the north.
   Live-ammunition drills are regularly met with strong opposition,
and a spate of recent training accidents has brought national
attention to Okinawan military issues, usually relegated to the
local media.
   In one of the accidents, a live round fired during a Marines
exercise ricocheted off tires on a shooting range at Camp Hansen in
central Okinawa and ended up in the restroom of a highway service
area, Vance said.
   ``And the day after we announced the closing of that range some
idiot goes and throws a tear gas cannister into a disco,'' Vance
said. Two women were injured in that incident at the Apple House in
Okinawa City in December.
   ``People ask how something like that could happen,'' he said. ``I
don't have an answer.''
   In early February, an article in the Okinawa Times said the disco
incident could trigger the kind of unrest that led to riots in 1970,
when more than 80 American vehicles were set afire.
   However, protests of U.S. military training and even the American
troops' presence itself are rarely anti-American in nature.
Sometimes Okinawans show more ill feeling toward the 6,500 members
of the Japanese Self Defense Forces stationed at 33 facilities and
offices in Okinawa.
   Okinawa, a former monarchy with close ties to China, Korea and
Southeast Asia, was incorporated by Japan in 1879.
   Many Okinawans believe their islands were used by the Japanese
command during World War II as a buffer to slow the advance of
Allied forces. During the battle of Okinawa in 1945 more than
100,000 civilians, 110,000 Japanese soldiers and 12,500 Americans
were killed.
   The United States turned Okinawa back the Japanese in 1972.
   ``The people of Okinawa have endured control by outside elements
throughout most of their history,'' said Vance. ``We realize that,
and when incidents occur, that is why we get such high visibility.''

<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Joe Ramos remembers days on the high
seas chasing sperm whales, the harpoon line whipping red hot over
the gunwales, the massive quarry thrashing in the water, threatening
the lives of its hunters.
   Ramos, 85, also remembers his mother crying as he left his native
Cape Verde islands off West Africa, following his father to New
Bedford from his drought-stricken homeland.
   ``The country was in bad shape. No water, no rain, no nothing.
That's when I decided to get out,'' said Ramos, who was 18 when he
boarded the Wanderer _ the last square-rigged American sailing ship
_ on April 28, 1921.
   ``In order to get out of the country I had to make a paper making
me 21. I was the youngest boy on the ship,'' he said. When the whale
boats came to Cape Verde, ``they never explained anything. They just
said, `You come with us and we're going to make you a man.'''
   Whaling ship captains were well aware of desperation like Ramos',
and lured teen-agers with promises of earnings as they made their
way to the new world.
   Whaling had long since peaked as an industry by that time, and
``no American in their right mind went whaling,'' said Joseph
Thomas, who publishes a historical publication called Spinner. ``It
was virtual slave labor.''
   Shipowners of Ramos' day ``were just playing out their capital.
The ships had paid for themselves many times over,'' said Richard
Kugler of the New Bedford Whaling Museum. ``The oil market had been
shrinking since the 1860s and the voyages out of New Bedford were
almost entirely sperm whale voyages, which had an oil chemically
different that still had uses and demands.''
   Ramos remembers earning $14 for a year's labor, but ``we didn't
care how much they paid, we wanted to get out to come here.''
   He also remembers being slapped by the captain because he
couldn't read a compass, having bug-infested beans to eat, and
seeing whale calves left to the sharks after their slower-moving
mothers were harpooned.
   ``I tell you, working on a whaling ship _ there was nothing to
enjoy there,'' said Ramos, who last put to sea in 1922, two years
before the last whaling square-rigger left New Bedford.
   Ramos still has the massive hands, thick fingers and leathered
skin developed from rowing a whaling dory, sometimes for a day at a
time. He never threw the harpoon; he rowed and when a whale was
harpooned, he poured water on the rope to keep it from burning as it
raced out of the boat.
   In addition to seasickness and bad food, whalers knew fear.
``When you leave the mother ship in that little boat to get behind
the whale, you don't know what's going to happen,'' Ramos said. A
harpooned whale would pull a dory full of whalers through the water
on what became known as the Nantucket sleigh ride. Often the whalers
would lose sight of their ship.
   The hunt became particularly dangerous when a harpooned whale
sounded, plunging deep into the sea in an effort to escape its
tormentors. ``When the whale goes down, he doesn't move. He stays
down, sometimes 15 minutes. When he comes up, he comes just like an
atomic bomb,'' Ramos said.
   A dead whale floating on the surface would be marked with a flag
for the mother ship to pick up while the men in the whale boat moved
on.
   Ramos moved on, too, and by 1924, when the Wanderer left New
Bedford on its last, brief, voyage, he had been ashore two years
picking cranberries for substantially more money than he earned on
the high seas.
   Years later after working in cranberry bogs, cotton mills and
construction sites, Ramos returned to New Bedford and visited the
whaling museum where shipping records show his name listed on the
crew of the Wanderer and, on a five-month voyage in 1922, aboard the
schooner Margarett.
   At 85, suffering from bad eyesight and poor circulation, Ramos
says he has forgotten much of his whaling days, but one image sticks
in his mind: A whale, after a sometimes protracted struggle, would
signal its demise by swimming in circles. ``And when he was ready to
die, he would face the sun.''

   Prices surged on London's Stock Exchange Monday as
leading British issues enjoyed a belated reaction to last week's
gains on Wall Street.
   Blue chip stocks advanced across a broad front after having
lagged behind the rest of the market recently.
   The London market managed to extend its gains during the
afternoon although the New York market was closed for the
President's Day holiday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 22.9
points, or 1.1 percent, higher at 2,065.8
   Volume was moderate with 465.8 million shares changing hands, up
marginally from 464.5 million shares on Friday.
   Dealers noted some selective buying among electronics, banking

   The dollar rose Monday against all major currencies
in European trading, subdued by the closing of U.S. markets for the
President's Day holiday. Gold prices also moved higher.
   Dealers said the dollar received a slight boost from the U.S.
government's announcement Friday that the nation's trade deficit
narrowed to $11.9 billion in December from a revised November figure
of $12.2 billion.
   But they said trading was uninspired with volume reduced to a
trickle as U.S. financial and stock exchanges closed for
Washington's Birthday.
   ``It was a very quiet day,'' said a trader at a major bank in
Frankfurt, West Germany. ``Nobody took any position at all.''
   Dealers said they were awaiting congressional testimony Tuesday
by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``If Greenspan takes the stand against inflation real
energetically, that would lead to a higher dollar in any event,''
the Frankfurt trader said.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7665 from $1.7780 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8435 West German marks, up from 1.8425; 1.5683
Swiss francs, up from 1.5643; 6.2825 French francs, up from 6.2725;
2.0820 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0790; 1,350.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,348.50; and 1.1897 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1859.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.61 Japanese yen to a closing 125.72
yen. Later, in London, it rose to 126.45 yen.
   Gold bullion rose in London to a bid price of $382.25 a troy
ounce, up from $380.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to $382.20 bid from $380 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.02 to close at a bid $380.18.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.93 a
troy ounce, unchanged from Friday's late bid price.

<HEAD>EEC Welcomes Move To Defuse Trade Dispute Over Hormones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the European
Economic Community on Monday welcomed steps toward resolving a trade
dispute with the United States over an EEC ban on imports of beef
treated with growth-boosting hormones.
   EEC and U.S. negotiators agreed over the weekend to form a task
force to study the dispute over the next 75 days and try to find
ways to end it.
   Frans Andriessen, the leading EEC negotiator, briefed the foreign
ministers on his talks Saturday with U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills and other officials.
   The foreign ministers said in a statement the creation of a
special panel was a step in the right direction to prevent a
full-fledged trade war.
   Hoewver, they stood by the EEC ban on imports of hormone-treaqted
meat from the United States and other countries.
   That ban, which took effect Jan. 1, affects imports of meat and
byproducts from the United States worth $100 million.
   The EEC imposed the ban for health reasons. The United States
says hormone-treated meat poses no health threat to consumers and
has responded by slapping duties on a range of EEC imports worth
$100 million.
   That in turn led the EEC to threaten retaliation with 100 percent
tariffs on $100 million in U.S. imports of dried fruit and walnuts.
   But Monday, the EEC ministers refrained from putting that threat
into effect.
   Instead, they said they would continue to seek an amicable
solution with Washington. Yet they asked Andriessen to pursue
``action within the GATT to get a condemnation of the unilateral
measures by the United States'' to restrict EEC imports.
   The Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is the
world trade organization.
   The EEC ministers, who met here for their regular monthly
consultations, again called on Washington to lift its import
restrictions.
   Andriessen's spokesman, Nico Wegter, quoted him as telling the
ministers, ``The EEC and the United States must get out of this
atmosphere of disputes and, if there are trade difficulties, the two
sides should find a solution in a multilateral framework.''
   In Washington on Saturday, Andriessen told reporters the United
States had indicated it would lower its retaliatory tariffs by an
amount equal to the shipments of hormone-free beef it is able to
make.
   He said consideration would be given to doubling the quota of
10,000 tons set for shipments of high-quality beef from the United
States. A higher quota would make it more profitable for American
producers to raise hormone-free meat.

<HEAD>Beer Companies Get Hot Ideas From Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's two largest beer companies, looking
for ways to carve out pieces of a stagnant U.S. market, have come up
with fruitful strategies lately by importing ideas from Japan.
   The Japanese have been big drinkers of bottled-draft beer and
``dry'' beer in recent years, and now the two products are among the
hottest selling items on American shelves.
   The phenomenon, however, is not being driven simply by the
Japanese market, analysts say. Instead, it is the result of flat
U.S. domestic sales that have forced brewers to open their eyes to
trends elsewhere.
   ``If this had been during a 4{ percent growth period, they might
have yawned at what was happening in Japan,'' said John Collopy, who
follows the beer industry and is president of the Milwaukee
investment firm, Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt &amp; Collopy Inc.
   ``Twenty years ago, the attitude was, `If God wanted us to have a
new product, grandfather would have invented it,''' said Robert
Weinberg, a St. Louis analyst and former executive at Anheuser-Busch
Cos. Inc.
   But now, Weinberg said, ``I'm sure they know what type of beer is
being brewed in Afghanistan. If a beer is taking off anywhere, they
are aware of it.''
   Miller Brewing Co., the country's No. 2 beer company based in
Milwaukee, started the recent trend in 1986 with the introduction of
Miller Genuine Draft.
   Ralph Kytan, Genuine Draft brand manager, said Miller officials
took notice a few years ago when packaged draft sales were climbing
in Japan.
   ``We're always looking all across the world at ideas,'' he said.
``We had senior executives in Japan, and they recognized what the
concept of draft beer meant to the Japanese consumer, it also meant
to the U.S. consumer.
   ``So we figured, if it can work there, it can work here.''
   Miller obtained an agreement with Japan's Sapporo brewing company
to purchase the technology necessary for the non-pasteurized,
packaged draft beer.
   Since Genuine Draft's introduction, the product has become one of
the fastest growing brands in the country. With shipments growing by
about 50 percent last year, Genuine Draft nearly cracked into the
top 10 among U.S. brands.
   Beer analysts are quick to note that American companies attempted
to sell packaged draft beer in earlier years but did not give it the
same push because the beer market was growing and there was less
pressure.
   Similarly, dry beers had been sold previously by regional
breweries, but officials at the larger companies say they were
motivated more by the lack of growth in their domestic market and
the dominance of dry beers in the Japanese market.
   ``I think it's a recognition on the part of U.S. companies that
it's a big world, and you can take ideas from anywhere,'' said John
MacDonough, vice president of brand management for Anheuser-Busch.
``If something seems to be working, you pay attention more.''
   Anheuser-Busch, the country's No. 1 brewer, started national
distribution of Michelob Dry late last year. In addition, G.
Heileman Brewing Co., the No. 5 brewer based in La Crosse, also is
selling dry beers on a regional basis.
   Both companies report customers have drained their products from
the shelves, although analysts say it is too soon to tell whether
dry beer will take root in the American market or just be a fad.
   But while Miller officials say Japanese and American drinkers
share a notion of draft beer being a fresher, more pure product, the
dry beers in the United States are much different from the Japanese
beers, both in substance and in image.
   Japanese dry beers have a higher alcohol content, MacDonough
said, and they are marketed with a macho image.
   But in pushing their dry beers, Anheuser-Busch and Heileman are
focusing on their products' lack of an aftertaste.
   While he thinks it is a coincidence that Japan has spurred the
recent trends in the United States, MacDonough acknowledged
Anheuser-Busch officials have paid more attention to the Japanese
market due to the company's overseas sales of Budweiser.
   ``We knew that dry beer was successful in Japan because we were
watching the media,'' he said. ``Ten years ago, we might not have
noticed.''

   Amer Group Ltd., a Finnish firm that controls
MacGregor Golf Co., will acquire Wilson Sporting Goods Co. from the
Wesray Capital Corp. for $200 million in cash, officials said Monday.
   Wilson, based in the Chicago suburb of River Grove, manufactures
and distributes a wide variety of athletic equipment and apparel
under the Wilson brand name. Wilson estimated net sales for 1988 of
$425 million, a 24 percent gain over 1987.
   WSGC Holdings Inc., Wilson's parent company, was purchased by
Morristown, N.J.-based Wesray in a $147 million leveraged buyout in
1985.
   Wilson had said previously it was looking for new sources of
financing to maintain the rapid growth it has achieved since its
acquisition by Wesray from Pepsico Inc.
   Amer is an international conglomerate with a controlling interest
in MacGregor, a Wilson competitor based in East Rutherford, N.J. The
company estimated in a statement its sales for the fiscal year
ending Feb. 28 would total $1.3 billion.

   Wendy's International Inc. said Monday its
fourth-quarter earnings rose 54 percent despite a slight drop in
sales.
   The fast-food restaurant chain reported earnings of $6.8 million,
or 7 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 1, up from $4.4
million, or 5 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $258.7 million, down from $259.3

   For the full year, Wendy's reported it earned $28.5 million, or
30 cents a share, compared with $4.5 million, or 5 cents a share,
for fiscal 1987.
   Revenue edged up to $1.063 billion from $1.059 billion in 1987.
   Robert L. Barney, chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed the results to improved restaurant operations and cost
control. He said restaurant operating costs were down more than $19
million for the year, while general and administrative expenses fell
about $12 million.

   The weekend arrival of new machinery may solve
production problems at a Minnesota chopsticks plant and allow the
factory to open, but the operation must still overcome a debt of
more than $9.1 million, the plant's owner said Monday.
   ``We're just sitting with our knees and fingers and toes and
everything crossed,'' said Ian Ward, president of Lakewood Forest
Products Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia. ``This has gone from
dream to nightmare and now it's turning into a dream again.''
   When the plant opened in Hibbing in July 1986, it was applauded
for its boldness in taking on Japan in the foreign trade war as it
tried to mass-produce chopsticks to the specifications of Japanese
buyers.
   The Japanese accepted some shipments, but Ward said machinery
problems have kept the plant from reaching its goal of 7 million
pairs of chopsticks a day. Production had reached between 700,000
and 1 million pairs a day before the plant was shut down for repairs
Dec. 15.
   Ward said Monday in a telephone interview from his Vancouver
office production was expected to resume as soon as workers install
a new reeler at the plant. The old reeler caused a vibration that
spoiled the chopsticks' veneer and was not large enough to handle a
volume of 7 million pairs a day, he said.
   The reeler, used to roll sheets of wood and load them into
cutting machines, was repaired and trucked to the Hibbing plant
Sunday.
   ``I think everybody has been full of stress and frustration but
all we can do is push ahead,'' Ward said. ``We have more commitment
to this thing. Other people may have walked away, but it's been a
well-conceived project that has had some difficulty.''
   He said the plant's revenue should begin to exceed expenses by
the middle of the year.
   Debts that must be repaid include $3.4 million in industrial
revenue bonds, about $500,000 loaned by the city of Hibbing,
$250,000 loaned by the state and $5 million loaned to the plant from
its parent company, Lakewood Forest Products Ltd., Ward said.
   Ward said Japanese buyers have not been alienated by the plant's
production problems and will buy as many chopsticks as the plant
produces. He said Lakewood will consider building other plants when
its Hibbing facility is operating efficiently.

   Texas Eastern Corp., fighting a hostile takeover
attempt by Coastal Corp., agreed to be acquired by Panhandle Eastern
Corp. Monday after Panhandle outbid Coastal with a $3.2 billion cash
offer.
   The agreement, subject to approval by federal regulators, was
accepted by the Texas Eastern board just hours after the $53-a-share
offer was approved by Panhandle Eastern's board of directors, said
Panhandle Eastern spokesman Jim Hart.
   The combination of the two Houston-based natural gas companies
would create a 27,000-mile system and result in the nation's
second-largest pipeline company in terms of total miles, Hart said.
   Coastal Corp. spokesman Will Osterloh said his company would
study the Panhandle Eastern offer before deciding whether to
continue its $2.6 billion bid for Texas Eastern.
   `We are going to consider our options, including possibly raising
our offer, dropping our bid or other courses of action open to us,''
Osterloh said.
   Under the agreement executed Monday, Panhandle Eastern plans to
begin a cash tender offer Tuesday for up to 80 percent of Texas
Eastern's 60.8 million outstanding shares at $53 per share, or a
total of $3.2 billion, Hart said.
   Those shares not purchased under the cash offer will be exchanged
for Panhandle Eastern stock at the same $53-a-share value, according
to the agreement.
   Texas Eastern's stock closed at $43.50 a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Friday. The exchange was closed Monday in
observance of President's Day.
   The Panhandle Eastern bid came five weeks after Coastal offered
$2.6 billion, or $42 a share. That offer was rejected by Texas
Eastern officials who believed the company could fetch a higher
price.
   ``We expect the combination of the two companies to result in
significant operating synergies and appreciably enhanced operating
income of the combined companies starting in 1990,'' said Robert
Hunsucker, chairman, president and chief executive officer for
Panhandle Eastern.
   Pahandle Eastern has access to large mid-continent supplies of
natural gas, including the Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and the Gulf of
Mexico, and also operates a large liquefied natural gas facility in
Lake Charles, La.
   The company also has connections to Canadian gas through the
Northern Border Pipeline, Hart said, while Texas Eastern has access
to the rapidly growing New England natural gas market.
   ``The combined systems will provide access to almost all the
major gas processing markets in the nation,'' said Texas Eastern
spokesman Fred Wichlep.
   Dennis R. Hendrix, president and chief executive officer at Texas
Eastern, described the agreement as ``the result of a thorough,
orderly process that has yielded for Texas Eastern stockholders the
best value among the proposals developed.''
   Texas Eastern officials said Monday they had talked to several
interested companies since Coastal's surprise takeover bid was
announced Jan. 16, but would not disclose the number or the
seriousness of other inquiries.
   However, Hendrix said, the Panhandle Eastern bid, which included
provisions for a share exchange, was by far the superior offer.
   ``The purchase price is approximately $650 million higher than
the Coastal Corp.'s tender offer, which our directors determined as
inadequate and advised our stockholders to reject,'' he said.
   Coastal and Texas Eastern have been in and out of court since the
start of the takeover fight as Coastal sought prevent Texas Eastern
directors from deploying anti-takeover measures.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston dissolved
an injunction designed to prevent Texas Eastern from filing parallel
lawsuits in other courts without his permission.
   Hughes said Coastal misrepresented facts when it said at the time
of a preliminary hearing on its requested injunction that it was not
involved in litigation elsewhere.
   Coastal issued a brief statement Monday which said the
dissolution of the injunction ``should not have any impact on
Coastal's court case because the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals had
stayed the injunction back on Jan. 29, 1989.''
   Wichlep, of Texas Eastern, said Hughes' action means, ``we are
free to take any legal matters that may arise subsequently to the
Delaware court or any other court.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Envirodyne Industries Inc. on Monday said it would
be premature to give a large shareholder, Artra Group Inc., a role
in talks that might lead to a bid for the company.
   Last week, Envirodyne said it had discussions with former
Beatrice Co. chairman Donald P. Kelly and investment banker Salomon
Brothers Inc. on a Kelly-Salomon proposal to acquire all of
Envirodyne's outstanding stock for $38 a share.
   With 18.2 million shares outstanding, the offer valued
Envirodyne, a manufacturer of sausage casings and plastics, at $690
million.
   Artra Group Inc. of Northfield, which owns 26.3 percent of
Envirodyne, asked Envirodyne to consider Artra's participation with
Kelly and Salomon.
   ``The board determined that it was premature to act,'' Envirodyne
said in a statement after a board meeting Monday.
   ``The board has made no determination that the company is for
sale but has authorized management to continue discussions with the
Kelly-Salomon group and other interested parties in order to
determine a course of action,'' Envirodyne said.
   Last August, Artra tried and failed to put together a cash offer
for Envirodyne that would have been worth about $36 a share. Artra,
based in Northfield, owns Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. and 70
percent of Lori Corp., a jewelry and accessories business.
   Artra owns 26.3 percent of Envirodyne stock, but it has to adhere
to certain agreements with Envirodyne or risk a buyback of the stock
at a low price, executives have said.
   Kelly, 66, heads D.P. Kelly &amp; Associates, a Chicago firm he
formed last year to seek, in partnership with Salomon, acquisitions
of ``undervalued companies.''
   Kelly announced his resignation from Beatrice last August after
selling large chunks of the company.

   One of the most cynical little intrusions into
the quality of life today is the telephone solicitation at
dinnertime from a bank promoting a credit card or a marketing firm
conducting a survey.
   Most people would probably rank it as one of those nagging little
mosquito bites of life that must be endured, too small a matter to
make an issue of, but certainly an irritant that their lives could
do without.
   It is when the mosquitoes swarm that the minor peeves become
unendurable, and no less an authority on the subject than ``The
Quality Review'' has given recognition to the disturbing phenomenon.
   The review, published by the American Quality Foundation and the
American Society for Quality Control, usually concerns itself with
momentous issues of product quality, especially as they relate to
American competitiveness.
   In the past, for example, it has declaimed on such matters as
Detroit's manufacturing problems, Japan's production efficiencies,
and engineering and statistical strategies for maintaining high
quality in goods production.
   Its descent into the more mundane world of pet peeves is provoked
by the feeling that the mosquitoes are everywhere, and that all
those little bites are leaving a welt on the quality of life equal
to that of shoddy products.
   Judging from its list, the irritants are all the more irritating
because as the country immerses itself deeper into the service
economy _ as opposed to an economy of goods production _ it may be
getting less service than ever before.
   First on its list is the unreturned telephone call. Making it
especially frustrating is that the original call probably was
received by a machine which, in its recorded voice, assured the
caller that a response would be forthcoming.
   It may lead to telephone tag, with each party making successive
fruitless attempts to return a call. The Review editors comment that
``this time-wasting endeavor is equivalent to rework in the
manufacturing arena.''
   Dinnertime sales or solicitation calls earned second place on the
list, and provoked the suggestion that the way to deal with them is
to screen your calls through an answering machine. Which, however,
may be your friends' pet peeve.
   Hotel telephone operators who leave you holding the phone so long
that you have to redial _ long-distance _ in order to leave a
message, make the list.
   ``Indefinitely delayed'' notices at airports earn a place, along
with the comment, ``If the airline can't bring itself to be up front
with the information that this flight may never leave the ground,
maybe they could post the odds.''
   Travelers who pre-empt overhead baggage compartments, sales
clerks who turn their backs on customers to serve telephone
customers instead, and servicemen or delivery men who keep you
waiting all day are high on the Review's list.
   One of the more serious of its pet peeves _ one that seemingly
could rank with some of the old-fashioned complaints that quality
control people used to be concerned with _ is the service contract.
   Even customers who purchase these contracts think they are a bad
idea, it says. It asks: ``Why should anyone need a five-year service
contract on a water heater that is `guaranteed' for 10 years?''
   All pet peeve lists are likely to differ, especially if an
attempt is made to limit them to a specific number.
   The Review, for example, feels that impenetrable packaging,
ranging from cracker wrappings to appliance containers, and
including envelopes that require tools to open, belong on many
lists, if not theirs.
   But it suggests that the diversity of lists merely proves the
point that there are so many of these little irritants swarming
through our service society that they are serving to create a major
problem.
