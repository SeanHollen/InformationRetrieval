   Travel into China has decreased so dramatically
that a United Airlines flight to Beijing on Friday didn't even carry
one passenger.
   The return flight, however, had 140 passengers, said United
spokesman Rob Doughty. ``We're virtually taking no one into China,''
Doughty said. ``At most, we have carried in five people.''
   A typical flight from Tokyo to Beijing carried about 400
passengers into China, he said.
   Numerous tour companies have canceled trips to China and have not
decided when tours will resume since the weekend of June 3-4 when
witnesses and Western intelligence sources said soldiers killed as
many as 3,000 people in Tiananmen Square. The government says the
fighting killed nearly 100 soldiers and police.
   Doughty said the lowest number of people United has flown out of
Beijing on one flight since the government crackdown was 60.
   Nancy Muller, a spokeswoman for American Express, said the
company is not scheduling any tours of China. The company earlier
canceled all tours through July and is evaluating whether to resume
tours in August.
   The State Department last week issued a travel advisory warning
travelers not to go to China.

   A Chilean guerrilla jailed for five days
was released Friday along with a countryman, and both were permitted
to leave the United States under escort, officials said.
   Sergio Buschmann, wanted in Chile in connection with the 1986
assassination attempt against Chilean President Augusto Pinochet,
was permitted to continue traveling to Sweden, a journey interrupted
Monday during a stopover at the Anchorage International Airport.
   Immigration officials boarded his flight and arrested him and
Eduardo Rojas, a Chilean companion reportedly serving as an
interpreter.
   Buschmann was held in Anchorage at the request of Interpol, the
international police agency. The Chilean government asked that he be
held pending a request for extradition.
   Buschmann, deported by Australia, was granted exile in Sweden.
Rojas was permitted to travel to Australia under escort, the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service said.
   ``INS detained them as excludable aliens out of concern for the
safety of the other passengers and crew on the flight,'' the agency
said in a news release. Officials later determined there were
insufficient grounds for continued detention, the news release said.
   Buschmann has been a spokesman for the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
Front, Chile's principal leftist guerrilla group. Two years ago, he
escaped from a prison in Chile, where he faced arms-smuggling
charges.
   The Chilean government sought Buschmann's extradition while he
was in Australia. Instead of complying, the Australian government
deported him on grounds he engaged in ``unacceptable activities.''
In Australia, he was raising funds for the guerrilla group and
publicly called for the assassination of Pinochet.
   Activities of the Manuel Rodreguez organization have been violent
and ``prejudicial to all Chileans who favor a return to democracy,''
and the activities are condemned by the U.S. government, the INS
said.

   As dusk settles on the tree-lined streets
of China's largest city, the neon lights flicker cheerfully.
   Nationwide unrest has quieted but not silenced night life in
Shanghai, famed for its song-and-dance halls, all-night restaurants
and cozy bars.
   ``Business slowed down a lot with all the confusion, but now
we're back up around 80 percent of normal,'' said a bartender at the
White Egret, a 24-hour pub and restaurant. ``The problem was that
with the traffic problems, people couldn't get to work, and they
couldn't get here.''
   Students and workers sympathetic to the pro-democracy movement in
Beijing staged their own massive protests after the military crushed
demonstrations in the capital on June 3-4.
   Protesters in Shanghai rolled public buses into major
intersections and let the air out of tires. They set up concrete
roadblocks on other streets.
   At their peak, the disruptions kept an estimated 50 percent of
Shanghai's 12 million residents away from their jobs.
   That hurt places like the 5th Avenue Super Bar, a tiny spot down
the street from the posh Shanghai Hilton.
   ``Do you see many customers here?'' asked a hostess at the 5th
Avenue.
   There was only one, a man sitting in a dark cubicle with another
hostess in his lap.
   The first hostess said the man was a diplomat from one of the
European consulates. ``These days Chinese are nervous and go
straight home after work, and foreigners have gone back to their
countries,'' she said.
   The unrest frightened the foreign community and most expatriates
left hurriedly after the crackdown in Beijing, fearing that troops
would be called into Shanghai next.
   Operators of night spots say foreigners are some of their best
customers.
   The 5th Avenue Super Bar seemed to be trying to make up for lost
revenue by soaking the few patrons it attracted. The bill for a
beer, soda pop and plate of watermelon came to the equivalent of
$32, a month's salary for many urban workers.
   Bartenders and managers say there are about 50 bars in Shanghai,
most of which come to life about 6 p.m. and do not close until the
wee hours of the morning. Their small, quaint neon signs light up
the darkness and hostesses with names like Jenny and Dolly pour
drinks, hold hands and stroke egos.
   But even the popular ones aren't full.
   At the two-story Napoleon, a few couples sat quietly in
high-backed chairs in the shadows while a handful of men gathered
around the counters upstairs and downstairs.

<HEAD>Cyclists Complete 10-Day Trip Over Pony Express Route</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cyclists who completed a 10-day ride
from California over the original Pony Express trail said they
encountered many of the same problems that faced pony riders of 1860.
   ``We still had to contend with the weather. There were mud bogs
where our cars got stuck, hail storms and at one point we had to
rebuild the road. The elements haven't changed,'' said cyclist Matt
DeWaal said.
   ``I have great respect for the pony riders who rode month after
month without so much as a hot shower,'' he said.
   DeWaal and Jay Aldous arrived in St. Joseph at noon Friday to
complete a journey that started in Sacramento, Calif. Aldous and
DeWaal, both from Salt Lake City, pedaled through a ribbon at the
finish line in front of Patee House Museum, the 1860 Pony Express
headquarters.
   ``It felt neat to cross the bridge into Missouri and realize we
were finally here,'' Aldous told the crowd of 200 who watched the
arrival. ``The Pony Express trail was about 1,938 miles long, but we
rode 2,041 miles with detours.''
   It was the first time bicyclists had traveled the original trail
in the same 10-day time covered by pony riders 129 years ago.
   Joe Nardone, trailmaster and Pony Express historian, said Aldous
and DeWaal managed to cover 400 miles of original Pony Express trail
that remains almost untouched because of the rough and primitive
terrain.
   ``At one point they even had to help rebuild the trail road to
get through,'' Nardone said. ``Their ride helped call attention to
the Pony Express at a time when Congress is considering whether to
make the route a part of the National Trails system.''
   The support crew made daily health checks of the riders, and
filmed a documentary of their trek, which included camping at
original stations as they crossing the dusty trail.
   The ride was not the longest made by Aldous and DeWaal. They set
a world record in 1984, circling the globe by bicycle. They covered
14,290 miles on four continents and 22 countries in 106 days.

   A Delta Air Lines jet hit turbulence Friday and
those people not wearing seat belts ``were flying through the air,''
a passenger said. Twenty-five people were taken to hospitals,
including one with broken ribs.
   ``The kids were screaming and the food was flying and the people
were flying,'' said Brenda Chevalier of Seattle, who was treated for
a sprained back at South Fulton Hospital.
   ``It's like you're on a roller coaster and at the top of a hill,
the way your stomach feel,'' she said. ``There's no control _ you've
lost it. I thought I was going to die. I kept screaming, `God,
please be with us.'''
   The Federal Aviation Administration said it had no measurement of
how far the jet dropped, but ``It was probably more like a two
second free fall that seemed liked 20 seconds,'' said FAA spokesman
Jack Barker.
   One passenger was in an intensive care unit and four others
remained hospitalized Friday night, said spokeswoman Ann Renner of
South Fulton Hospital, where 12 other passengers were treated and
released.
   A Shallowford Hospital official said one passenger was admitted
in stable condition with a concussion. One passenger was being held
for observation at Georgia Baptist Hospital and one was released.
Five were treated and released at Clayton General Hospital.
   Delta spokeswoman Glenda Hatchett Johnson said several more
passengers were treated for bruises by paramedics at Hartsfield
International Airport in Atlanta.
   The jet, which was traveling from Seattle to Atlanta, entered an
area of unexpected air turbulence while flying about 25,000 feet
over Alabama, said Delta spokesman Jim Lundy. It landed at
Hartsfield at 3:45 p.m.
   Flight 102 carried 282 passengers.
   A passenger who wasn't injured, Linda Alexander from Seattle,
said anybody not wearing their seat belt was in danger.
   ``As it (the plane) dropped, anyone not fastened in went up and a
lot of people were flying through the air,'' she said.
   Ms. Johnson said the seat-belt light was on at the time.
   John Martin of Chattanooga, Tenn., said flight attendants were
serving passengers when the plane hit the air pocket and, although
they were thrown too, helped injured passengers.
   Delta spokesman Neil Monroe said two flight attendants were
injured but not seriously.
   Ms. Chevalier said the pilot had told passengers at the start of
the trip that it was his last flight after 33 years of flying. When
the plane landed at Hartsfield, the pilot was ``crying like a
baby,'' she said.
   Ms. Johnson said Delta would not release the pilot's name.
   Also Friday, a Northwest Airlines jet en route from Seattle to
Detroit made an unscheduled landing in Bismarck, N.D., after one of
its engines developed an oil leak, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported in that incident.

   The reburial of Imre Nagy as a martyr 31
years after his execution as a traitor illustrates the Soviet bloc's
increasing tendency to discard official Stalinist histories and
accept events as they were.
   Encouraged by the Soviet exposure of Josef Stalin's excesses,
Hungary and Poland are confronting long-avoided questions about the
1956 uprising crushed by Soviet tanks in the streets of Budapest and
the murder of Polish officers by the Soviets in the woods of Katyn.
   Rewriting history has been common in the communist world since
the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.
   ``Rehabilitation'' is the term often used when honor is restored
to former leaders disgraced or executed by ascendant rivals, who
often, in their turn, also fall from power.
   Although the current view of history is far more honest, there
still are elements of tailoring it to political ends.
   In the Soviet Union, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has expressed
disapproval of Leonid I. Brezhnev but to some degree has
rehabilitated Nikita S. Khrushchev, whom Brezhnev discredited.
   Brezhnev now stands for the corrupt, stagnant policies Gorbachev
seeks to change and Khrushchev is seen as the forerunner of the
re-examination of Stalin's dictatorship.
   Nikolai I. Bukharin and other old Bolsheviks purged by Stalin
also have had their respectibility restored.
   Leon Trotsky, who commanded the Red Army in the civil war after
1917 and lost the power struggle to Stalin, has not been
rehabilitated but the Kremlin's view of him seems kinder. Trotsky
was living in Mexico in 1940 when an assassin sent by Stalin killed
him with an ax.
   In the turbulence of the communist world, rehabilitation
sometimes is quick.
   Solidarity was born in Poland in 1980, during a strike led by
Lech Walesa, and outlawed in 1982. Walesa was detained for months
and the independent union was reviled.
   Seven years later, Solidarity negotiated free elections with the
government and the voters gave it a stunning victory.
   When communist demigods die, criticism can grow just as quickly.
   President Tito was unchallenged in Yugoslavia from World War II
until his death in 1980, but his policies are being questioned nine
years later and elaborate birthday festivities have been abandoned.
   Milovan Djilas, once heir apparent but later imprisoned by Tito
for nine years because of his dissident views, has made a comeback
after 36 years of being ostracized.
   ``If Tito's reign had been shorter, there would have been many
fewer doubts cast on his merits,'' Djilas, a successful writer, said
recently.
   Friday's reburial in Hungary represented almost a complete
reversal of political fortunes for Nagy and Janos Kadar, who took
over after the Soviets crushed the 1956 revolt.
   Kadar, initially reviled, gained respect in the 1960s for
releasing many of those jailed in the revolt and for pursuing
political and economic reform.
   He put brakes on reform in the 1970s, however, and when he
resigned last year had become a symbol of economic stagnation and
political rigidity.
   Last month, the Central Commmittee of the Communist Party
criticized Kadar, while hailing Nagy as a symbol of reform.
   This week, the government declared said it ``rejects the
erroneous and indeed reprehensible political decisions of the past,
the reprisals that followed 1956.''
   Czechoslovakia, evidently worried that Nagy's reburial might draw
attention to the case of Alexander Dubcek, said Thursday ``enemies
of socialism'' might abuse the change in official sentiment.
   Dubcek was Communist Party chief in Czechoslovakia during the
``Prague Spring'' of reform that was crushed by a Soviet-led
invasion in August 1968. He now lives in relative obscurity.

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has confirmed the death of
Salet Gaba, an employee of The Associated Press for 20 years, nearly
two years after reporting his detention.
   In an interview Tuesday in the N'Djamena, Information Minister
Adoum Moussa Seif said Gaba was killed by an army patrol in central
Guera province in 1987. The government alleges Gaba was involved in
an armed rebellion.
   Last December, the London-based human rights organization Amnesty
International said Gaba was killed by security forces in a N'Djamena
prison sometime in mid-1988.
   Previously, the official radio and President Hissene Habre had
said Gaba was in prison awaiting trial. On Tuesday, Moussa Seif
denied the Amnesty report but did not explain the contradiction
between previous official statements and his new version of how Gaba
died.
   Amnesty International first reported that Gaba, who dropped out
of sight in December 1986 fearing arrest, was detained on July 14,
1987, in Mongo, capital of his home region of Guera, and was being
held without charge in N'Djamena.
   The official Chad radio, the Central African nation's only
station, reported his detention in August 1987, but said Gaba was
arrested ``neither for his opposition to the regime of President
Hissene Habre, nor for his beliefs and even less for tribal
reasons.''
   It said he was arrested ``after having been caught with weapons
in his hands ... and because he is the author of the deaths of two
peasants.''
   At a news conference during the French-African summit in December
1987, Habre said Gaba was ``captured in a state of rebellion'' and
was to be tried for illegal possession of arms.
   Chad is a sparsely populated former French colony that has been
torn by civil war almost constantly since independence in 1960.
Gaba, a member of the minority Hadjerai ethnic group, worked for
Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, before joining the AP.

   After a Domino's Pizza delivery car hit Frank
Kranack's station wagon outside a suburban Domino's store, Kranack
said the manager rushed to the wreckage and demanded, ``Let's get
this pizza on the road.''
   ``With all the damage there, I just didn't believe he was worried
about the pizza,'' Kranack said this week.
   Kranack, 42, an accountant, claimed whiplash injury in the
October 1985 accident. His wife, Mary Jean, 42, claimed neck and
back injuries and says her right arm, nearest the impact, is
permanently disabled.
   The couple's attorney, Kenneth R. Behrend, filed a lawsuit for
damages _ not against the 18-year-old driver, but against Domino's
Pizza Inc., claiming in part that the company encourages dangerous
driving with its trademark 30-minute delivery guarantee.
   ``People are being injured all over the country,'' Behrend said.
``These drivers are trying to deliver pizzas within 30 minutes and
sometimes it's just not physically possible. They may run a stop
sign, go over speed limits or make illegal turns.''
   Domino's denies Behrend's charge, says the company constantly
reminds its drivers that safety is important and disqualifies
delivery people with three or more serious moving violations.
   Behrend said he has gathered information on at least 30 serious
accidents in recent years related to Domino's speedy delivery.
   Ron Hingst, Domino's spokesman at its Ann Arbor, Mich.,
headquarters, said the company knows of 20 fatalities involving
Domino's drivers, pedestrians and others last year, but that
accidents are bound to happen in such a large fleet, believed to be
about 75,000 to 80,000 drivers.
   Jesse Colson apparently was Domino's most recent death this year.
   Colson, 17, of Plainfield, Ind., a Domino's driver working 18
miles southwest of Indianapolis, was killed June 3 when his small
pickup truck skidded on a rain-slicked road and hit a utility pole.
His mother, Suzanne Butros, said he was speeding and called Domino's
guarantee ``an invitation to break the law.''
   Ed Kelley, police chief in St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., said in
1987 his department had to crack down on speeding Domino's drivers.
   ``When we catch them, it's going to be one driver to go,'' Kelley
said at the time.
   Hingst said the Domino's dominance of the home-delivery pizza
business is based on its famous 29-year-old promise to deliver pizza
within 30 minutes of a telephone order.
   Last year, Domino's sold about 230 million pizzas, delivering
about 90 percent, from about 5,000 owned and franchised stores in
the United States, Hingst said.
   The company has grown from just 300 outlets in 1980 in part on
its boast it would deliver the pizza for free if its drivers were
late, within a specified radius.
   Now, Hingst said, Domino's gives a $3 refund for a late pizza
because some customers, particularly college students, deliberately
gave imprecise directions just to get free food.
   Behrend and other lawyers are trading information about Domino's
and its delivery guarantee.
   ``I want to see the 30-minute guarantee stopped and my client
wants it stopped,'' Behrend said.
   Hingst said said Domino's works on speed in the store to get the
pizzas out within 12 or 13 minutes after the order.
   ``We emphasize hustle once they get to the store. But once they
get into the car, there should be common-sense safe driving,''
Hingst said. ``Some people say we're encouraging these kids to race.
But, no, we're encouraging them to hustle. There's a difference.''
   Behrend charged some drivers are given as many as five pizzas to
deliver within about 15 minutes.
   ``That's rare,'' Hingst said.
   He denied that Domino's system, in which mileage and tips
supplement wages, encourages recklessness.
   ``We ask drivers to volunteer to their customers that the pizza
is late and, if they're real courteous about it, they may get a tip
and it may be to their benefit,'' Hingst said. He said the $3 refund
comes from the store, not the driver's pocket.
   Behrend said Domino's encourages drivers to run to and from their
cars, and it awards its top driver an all-expenses-paid trip to the
Indianapolis 500, where the company has a race car.
   ``What is the mental attitude they're encouraging? The model of
that race car sits in a lot of their stores, encouraging the
impression of a race car driver.
   ``That will be a great story when it's time to talk to a jury,''
Behrend said.
   Hingst said the Indianapolis trip was discontinued four years
ago. He said a recent incentive program involving the opening of
Domino's 5,000th store rewarded all drivers with at least 5,000 safe
driving hours.

   Two bank robbers escaped during a
shootout Friday that left a police officer wounded and an accomplice
dead.
   A fourth man, the getaway driver, was arrested outside City
National Bank of Hallandale after his car was riddled by police
bullets. One of the fugitives may also have been wounded, police
said.
   Police did not realize the men had escaped until a siege of
several hours ended when a SWAT team dropped in from a helicopter
and did not find anyone inside.
   The robbers used a guard's uniform to fool employees as they
arrived at the bank in the morning. They also seemed familiar with
the bank's operation, police said.
   ``It was well planned,'' Police Chief Richard Fox said. ``It
takes some planning if this person had a security guard's uniform
on. They apparently knew the routine. It was not sloppy at all.''
   Hallandale police Lt. David Miles, 42, a 16-year veteran, was in
stable condition at Hollywood Memorial Hospital with gunshot wounds
to the cheek and the groin, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Miles' new bulletproof vest, which stopped the shot aimed at his
groin, probably saved his life, said police Sgt. Jack Kudrick.
   ``We understand he just started wearing one a week ago,'' said
City Manager R.J. Intindola. ``He's lucky he did because he was shot
at point-blank range.''
   The robbery attempt began just before 7 a.m., FBI spokesman Paul
Miller said when the phony guard let bank employees in and then tied
them up.
   A silent alarm was sounded as the robbers tried to force an
employee to open the vault. The bank's vault was never opened,
authorities said.
   As Hallandale officer Daniel O'Connell, 44, responded to the
alarm, he was disarmed and tied up.
   That officer was followed by Miles, who exchanged shots with the
suspects.
   ``The officer who had been held hostage broke away and as he went
out of the bank, exchanged shots,'' Miller said. Four bank employees
were able to walk out as they saw police arrive.
   One robber, identified only as a Nicaraguan, was felled in a hail
of bullets as he fled the bank, dying several feet from the getaway
car.
   The driver emerged unscathed even though the car windows were
shot out, and he was taken into custody. Pedro A. Sonarrida of
Hialeah was charged with first-degree murder, attempted homicide,
armed robbery and false imprisonment.
   The murder charge stems from the death of his cohort during the
commission of a felony.
   Officers surrounded the bank for what they assumed was a standoff
with robbers inside. Shortly before 11 a.m., a helicopter dropped
six SWAT team members onto the bank's roof, but a search of the
building turned up no suspects.
   One witness said she saw one man jump on a bus when the shooting
first broke out.
   ``I saw three guys running this way. One got killed. One ran into
a bus, and the other I don't know where he went,'' said Carmen
Melgar, 50, a hair stylist across the street who said she was nearly
shot herself when a bullet shattered her window.
   ``I feel so lucky ... like I'm born again,'' she said.
   The bank's regular security guard is missing, and police aren't
sure if he is in trouble relating to the foiled bank robbery.

pictures that the National Enquirer claims are of her baby, and a
family spokesman says inquiring minds should know they're not.
   The supermarket tabloid ran photos of a baby in a bassinet on
June 12, claiming it was the 7-pound, 2-ounce Danielle Riley Keough.
She was born May 29 in Santa Monica to Presley's daughter, Lisa
Marie, 21, and her husband, Danny Keough.
   People magazine also ran a cover photograph this week of Ms.
Presley holding a swaddled baby whose eyes are closed and is sucking
on a pacifier.
   ``The baby on the cover of the Enquirer is not their baby,'' said
Paul Bloch, the parents' publicist.
   The child in the Enquirer photo lacks a small curl Danielle has
on her forehead, and the hospital crib has a chart and a medical
tag, both of which were absent from Danielle's crib, Bloch said.
   ``My answer is, that he needs a new set of glasses,'' said Iain
Calder, the Enquirer's editor. ``You can see the hair is exactly the
same in both (photos), the nose is the same, the eyes are the same.
There is absolutely no doubt we published pictures of the correct
baby.''

   NBC News President Michael Gartner said the
network was caught off guard when it decided against sending
anchorman Tom Brokaw to China for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
recent visit.
   ``You make decisions all the time about what to do and what not
to do,'' Gartner told a luncheon audience Friday of nearly 900 at
the national conference of Investigative Reporters and Editors. ``We
didn't know that the world's biggest nation was going to have a
revolt.''
   The comments came when a member of the audience asked Gartner if
he had any regrets about Brokaw's absence while CBS anchorman Dan
Rather remained in Beijing for the pro-democracy protests. CNN also
sent its anchorman, Bernard Shaw.
   ``As it happened, we had a lot of people there, and a lot of very
good people there,'' said Gartner.
   ``We didn't have Brokaw there. ABC didn't have (anchorman Peter)
Jennings there,'' he continued. ``You make decisions all the time:
Is this going to be a great big one or not going to be a great big
one? Ultimately we did send Tom in there. He's there now.''

   A former passport clerk testified she asked for
an investigation of the state district attorney's office after
officials there refused to prosecute entertainer Joey Heatherton for
allegedly assaulting her.
   Mary Polik, 27, said Friday a letter to former U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese was written ``by my father and I signed it.''
She said she sent similar letters about the district attorney's
office to Gov. Mario Cuomo, Mayor Edward Koch and Police
Commissioner Benjamin Ward.
   Polik, who is suing Heatherton for $6 million, said the
entertainer ripped out her hair and ``banged and bashed'' her head
on a counter after she told the entertainer she had the wrong photos
for a passport and needed the $35 fee in exact change.
   Heatherton, 44, denies she hit Polik during the confrontation on
July 8, 1985. She says any contact with the clerk was accidental
while she was trying to retrieve her documents.
   Heatherton's lawyer, William Kunstler, got Polik to acknowledge
during his cross-examination that the letters, all dated Jan. 27,
1986, were written after she filed her suit against Heatherton.
   Ms. Heatherton was acquitted on federal charges of disorderly
conduct and obstructing government administration in the case in
September 1986.
   The trial resumes Monday.

   Dick Gregory says bubble gum wrappers and
watermelon rinds have replaced syringes and condoms in the litter at
Palmer Park, a sign that children are coming back to the area
notorious as a drug haven.
   Gregory, the social activist and former comedian, has been in
Shreveport for eight days in an effort to make A.B. Palmer Park drug
free.
   He was arrested three times during his first two days when he
raided stores and persuaded owners to remove drug paraphernalia from
their shelves.
   He said Friday that he and several local ministers planned to
picket crack houses in the Cedar Grove neighborhood, a working-class
area that has fallen on hard times with widespread unemployment.

   Olympic weightlifter Naim Suleymanoglu's
relatives crossed from Bulgaria into Turkey as part of a wave of
thousands of ethnic Turks being deported from their country.
   Suleymanoglu, an ethnic Turk who defected to Turkey from Bulgaria
in 1986, won Turkey's first Olympic gold medal in 20 years at last
summer's Olympics.
   Two of Suleymanoglu's cousins crossed the border with their wives
and children on Friday, the semiofficial Anatolia News Agency
reported.
   Ethnic Turks complain that Bulgaria has been repressing the
cultural minority. Demonstrations against Bulgaria's efforts to
assimilate the Turks broke out in the communist country last month.
   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Friday that more than 28,000
ethnic Turks had arrived in this country in the last three weeks.

   An earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale
rocked the Tokyo area and southern Japan early Saturday but no
damage or casualties were reported, the Central Meteorological
Agency said.
   The quake, centered 310 miles south of Tokyo in the Pacific
Ocean, struck at 8:43 a.m. (7:43 p.m. EDT Friday).
   ``There are no reports of damage or casualties,'' a spokesman for
the National Police Agency said Saturday morning.
   The meteorological agency said there was no danger of tidal waves
along eastern Japan's Pacific coast because the epicenter of the
quake was too deep.
   Agency officials said the quake's epicenter was about 230 miles
under the Pacific.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas, while one measuring 7 is considered a major earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>US Offering Shelter to More Chinese Diplomats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision to offer protection
to all Chinese citizens in the United States has paved the way for
at least two more Chinese diplomats to obtain refuge here.
   A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Friday that besides the two Chinese diplomats who announced in
San Francisco they intended to defect, ``there have been additional
Chinese officials who have asked for protection in the United
States.''
   He refused to give a specific number who have sought refuge, nor
to confirm a report that a husband and wife, both diplomats in the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, were the diplomats in question.
   According to published and broadcast reports, those two are Han
Guohong, secretary to the ambassador, and her husband Zhang Chiwei,
an attache in the press office at the embassy in Washington. There
was no one available for comment at the embassy early today.
   The move to offer the additional Chinese diplomats refuge came as
more people were arrested in China for taking part in pro-democracy
protests and China's leaders increased efforts to absolve the
government of the bloody attack on protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   The official said the Chinese diplomats who have asked for
protection have not formally asked for asylum, but could do so in
the future.
   He explained that the diplomats are covered under Bush's decision
to grant all Chinese citizens in the United States permission to
remain here until June 1990.
   On Monday, Zhou Li-min, 26, a Chinese vice consul in San
Francisco for cultural affairs, and Zhang Li-min, 25, vice consul
for overseas affairs, announced plans to defect. Immigration
officials said the two were in hiding after meeting with FBI and
immigration authorities.
   There are believed to be some 73,000 Chinese students in the
United States, as well as some 250,000 visitors and business people
who could be eligible under Bush's offer.
   Chinese diplomats based in Canada, Australia and Japan are also
reported to have sought refuge in those countries.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush deplores
the persecutions of Chinese who demonstrated for democracy but has
no current plans to impose further sanctions or interruption of
relations with China.
   ``We continue to watch the situation,'' said Fitzwater. ``We'll
continue to measure it as we go forward. Sanctions are always a part
of that review, but we have nothing to announce.''
   Bush has refused to affix blame for China's bloodshed but has
said it would be ``extraordinarily difficult'' for the United States
to have normal relations with officials responsible for the massacre
of students and workers participating in pro-democracy protests.
   U.S. officials repeatedly have stressed the importance of the
relationship between the two countries and Washington's interest in
retaining formal ties.
   Fitzwater declined to characterize Bush's reaction to attempts by
Beijing officials to rewrite the story of the bloody massacre two
weeks ago in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and claim that no
demonstrators were killed.
   But he said anyone who has seen the television reports knows what
happened, despite the Chinese propaganda attempts.
   ``Those matters all speak for themselves ... The pictures and the
reality of the reporting has been so dramatic that these kind of
efforts stand beside them so starkly that I wouldn't even want to
try to diminish that by giving it words,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Atwater Gets Vote of Confidence From GOP</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater has
been handed a fresh vote of confidence from party leaders and a
challenge from his Democratic counterpart ``to move politics in this
nation out of the gutter.''
   Atwater, under fire from Democrats and critics within the GOP for
his rough-and-tumble style of politics, was praised in a resolution
Friday by the party's national committee.
   The committee's resolution said Atwater's aggressive stance has
``made him the target of unremitting attacks from Democrats and
their surrogates'' and he should keep it up.
   The resolution neglected to mention the controversy surrounding a
GOP memo about the new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. The memo from
Atwater's office compared the voting record of the new House speaker
with that of Rep. Barney Frank, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who
has acknowledged being homosexual.
   The memo bore the heading, ``Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal
Closet,'' a play on the expression for acknowledging one's
homosexuality.
   The memo led to the resignation last week of an Atwater aide,
Mark Goodin, and caused an outcry from Democrats. Atwater said he
did not know about the memo until after it was sent out. President
Bush said at the time he believed Atwater and praised him for doing
a ``great job.''
   It remained to Senate Republican leader Bob Dole to bring Foley's
name up from the platform for the first time in one of the closing
speeches on Friday.
   Dole reviewed the nomination battles in which Supreme Court
nominee Robert Bork and Defense Secretary-designate John Tower were
defeated, and said, ``We don't need any more smears of character.''
   ``That was the problem of Robert Bork, of John Tower and, yes, of
Tom Foley,'' he said.
   ``I have had my differences with Lee Atwater,'' Dole told the
Republican group, ``but the president has spoken and Lee Atwater is
staying and he should and he is doing a good job.''
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia claimed in his
speech that different standards are applied to liberals and
conservatives in Washington and that ``if you are a whistle blower
in the conservative movement and the Republican Party, there are no
holds barred in trying to destroy you.''
   It was Gingrich, not then GOP whip, who first called for the
ethics investigation of former Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, which
led to the elevation of Foley from majority leader.
   In debate on the resolution, Jack London, the GOP national
committeeman from Arizona, said the party chairman has ``the courage
to do what all of us need to do.''
   In Nashville, Tenn., on Friday, Democratic Party chief Ronald
Brown, saying ``American politics is in trouble,'' called for
Atwater's help in writing a campaign ethics code.
   ``As chairmen of our respective parties we must resolve to move
politics in this nation out of the gutter and up to a higher, more
noble, level,'' Brown said at a meeting of the Association of
Democratic Chairs.
   Laying the blame squarely on Republicans, Brown said Bush must
take charge because his ``troops are out of control.''
   ``The Republican Party leadership has become the princes of dirty
politics, dirty practices and negative campaigning,'' Brown said.
   In response, the GOP committee issued a statement in which
Atwater said President Bush will send Congress a proposal on
campaign reform ``very soon.''
   ``I will forward a copy of this proposal to Ron Brown for his
review'' and if Brown agrees with Bush's proposal ``then we may
indeed have a need to sit down and discuss the issue,''
   The GOP statement said Atwater also hoped Brown would agree ``to
discuss uniform criteria to insure that the nationwide 1991
redistricting of congressional and legislative districts is done in
a fair, ethical and open manner.''

   Women who choose against nursing their newborn
children may have to get along without hormones and drugs that
prevent painful breast engorgement.
   The Food and Drug Administration says it will ask drug companies
to stop promoting these hormones and drugs for non-nursing mothers
because they are no more effective than mild analgesics or breast
supports and may do harm.
   FDA officials plan to meet soon with drug companies about getting
them to agree to stop marketing the medicines for that purpose.
   ``I'm sure we'll agree to ask the companies to comply with the
recommendations of the committee,'' Philip A. Corfman, executive
secretary of the advisory committee and FDA's supervisory medical
officer for fertility and maternal health drugs, said Friday.
   ``The issue is how much further we wish to go in the matter to
get them to comply,'' he said. The FDA could withdraw approval for
use of the suppressants for breast engorgement, he said.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group says use of the hormones
and drugs needlessly exposes more than 700,000 new mothers to health
risks. Jennifer R. Niebyl, a physician on the FDA committee said the
pain is ``significant'' for only 10 percent of the women who get the
drug.
   Corfman said the estrogen and androgen hormones and their
combinations have been shown to raise the risk of blood clots.
   Bromocriptine is associated with a small number of seizures,
strokes and heart attacks, he said.
   The drug is made by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover,
N.J., and sold under the name Parlodel.
   David L. Winter, a spokesman for Sandoz, said studies have found
``no provable connection'' between bromociptine and the adverse
effects Corfman cited.
   ``We believe it's an issue of choice as to whether a woman
chooses to take a pharmacologic approach,'' Winter said.
   The company agrees the drug should not be used as a routine
therapy for non-nursing mothers, he said. ``However, we feel there
is a subset of women who for many different reasons cannot or choose
not to breast-feed should have the options explained to them,''
including the use of bromocriptine, he said.
   More than 4 million women have used bromocriptine in the nine
years it has been on the market and few adverse effects have been
reported, Winter said.
   He said the FDA has not contacted the company.
   The advisory group addressed only the use of hormones and the
drug bromocriptine to stop milk production in non-nursing mothers.
Bromocriptine, for which lactation suppression is the major use, and
the hormones have several other approved uses, and those other
approvals would not be affected by withdrawal of FDA approval for
lactation suppression.

   Jeff Mayer bills himself as the most expensive
maid in the nation. Business executives actually pay him $1,000 to
tell them how to clean off their cluttered desks.
   ``I go into an office and it looks like the desk was in the spin
cycle of a washing machine,'' says the 39-year-old Mayer. ``And when
we're done, it's like the flight deck of a aircraft carrier.''
   Over the past five years, Mayer says his one-man company, Mayer
Enterprises, has done this job on 700 executives in the Chicago
area. He has gathered enough theories and techniques about office
organization to fill a book, so he's writing one.
   But are his lessons worth $1,000?
   Barry Wolf, owner of Communications Research &amp; Development in
Chicago, swears his money was well spent.
   ``About three years ago, I realized my office was just piled high
and very disorganized and time was getting tighter and tighter,''
said Wolf. ``So out of the blue he calls and says, `How would you
like to get your time more organized?' ''
   ``So he got my life organized,'' Wolf recalled. ``And my office
is still as neat as a tack.''
   Wolf said executives face the same problem _ a limited amount of
time to get a lot of work done.
   ``If $1,000 buys you an hour a day and you can make money during
that hour, you bet it pays,'' said Wolf.
   Mayer's formula for clutterbusting is simple. (Executives: Pay
attention and save $1,000.)
   He has the executives make a master list of things to do, an
inventory of all unfinished work. He does it by sorting through the
papers piled on a desk one by one. If the paper needs to be saved it
goes into a file, otherwise it gets pitched.
   Stacks of papers represent wasted time and wasted money to Mayer.
   ``If you ask them about it, they say if they see it, they'll
remember to do it. But it gets buried and they don't see it
anyhow,'' said Mayer in an interview earlier this week.
   He meets with the executives for two sessions of two hours each.
   ``At the end of two hours, there's a list one or two pages long,
a handful of file folders we've made and there's probably two
garbage cans filled with junk,'' said Mayer.
   Patricia Wier, president of Encyclopaedia Britannica, concedes
she had doubts when she hired Mayer, but concluded his techniques
really do work.''
   She said his system was so simple she should have thought of it
herself.
   ``But the fact is, I didn't,'' she said. ``I was so impressed, I
sent him to four or five other executives in the company.''

<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's chief watchdog says the agency ignored his
recommendations for safeguards against the theft of money from the
sale of foreclosed property with government-insured mortgages.
   Testifying Friday before a House subcommittee, Inspector General
Paul Adams also said the accounts of at least a dozen private agents
in HUD's property sales program nationwide were being examined for
possible misappropriation, fraud and embezzlement.
   One of the agents, nicknamed ``Robin HUD'' because she said she
gave most of her proceeds to the poor, tearfully admitted in
Friday's hearing that she stole $5 million in funds due the
government.
   Quoting Scripture and claiming she ``followed a higher law,''
Mary Louise Harrell told the House subcommittee on housing and
employment, ``I have come forward, as one who loves the Lord, in an
attempt to confess to the world that I diverted government funds.''
   Adams told the subcommittee he had repeatedly warned top agency
officials, including former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, that the
system for monitoring money from property sales was weak.
Investigators are trying to track down $20 million from those sales.
   ``HUD has not established effective monitoring systems to assure
that closing agents properly carry out their responsibilities,''
Adams said.
   ``Moreover, planned changes to its automated systems have been
slow, and current systems do not contain all information field
offices need to properly monitor agent activities,'' he added.
   But the inspector general came under fire from lawmakers for
doing nothing when his warnings and recommendations were ignored.
   ``It looks to me like you just covered your rear end because you
told them,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   ``It's your job to make sure this doesn't happen,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal said top officials in the
Reagan administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development
overruled staff objections and awarded a $268,000 grant to a company
run by Republican fundraiser Frederick Bush.
   Bush &amp; Co. subcontracted the technical work for the project, an
economic development plan for Puerto Rico, to another firm for
$125,000 and took the rest of the grant, according to HUD records
obtained by the newspaper.
   Bush was deputy finance chairman for then-Vice President George
Bush's presidential campaign last year and is now the nominee for
ambassador to Luxembourg. He is no relation to President Bush.
   A HUD official said Friday the details of the Journal story were
``absolutely correct.''

<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John
Poindexter has become the second defendant in the Iran-Contra
scandal to try to put President Bush and former President Reagan on
the witness stand.
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler said Friday that Bush and Reagan
have information relevant to the criminal charges against Poindexter.
   The same effort to subpoena Bush and Reagan was made in the trial
of former White House aide Oliver North. But U.S. District Court
Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed the subpoenas.
   Gesell said there was no proof North received authorization from
Reagan to engage in illegal conduct, and he said North failed to
demonstrate that Bush, who was Reagan's vice president, had any
relevant information.
   Poindexter, unlike North, met daily with Reagan, and so may have
more solid legal grounds for asking the former president to testify.
   In other legal action Friday, prosecutors said they will seek to
narrow the scope of criminal charges against Poindexter.
   Associate independent counsel Christian Mixter told U.S. District
Court Judge Harold Greene that after the charges are narrowed
``there would be no reason to involve'' Bush and Reagan in the trial.
   Prosecutors want to cut the size of the Poindexter case in an
attempt to avoid the kind of protracted legal battle over classified
information that nearly derailed the North trial.
   To be abandoned will be portions of a conspiracy count that delve
into the diversion of Iran arms sale money to the Contra rebels
trying to overthrow the leftist government in Nicaragua.
   The remaining four counts against Poindexter accuse him of
obstructing and making false statements to Congress in connection
with North's secret resupply operation for the Contras and a 1985
arms shipment to Iran.
   Prosecutors also moved to dismiss far-reaching conspiracy and
theft charges against Iran-Contra figure Richard Secord.
   Secord was enlisted by North to run arms to the Contras during a
congressional ban on military aid to the rebels.
   In court papers, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said he
wished to avoid the same legal fight over state secrets that loomed
in the Poindexter case. Federal agencies are reluctant to give
Secord access to classified documents to prepare his defense.
   Secord is also charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuity
to North by arranging to set up a $200,000 Swiss bank account for
his children and by financing installation of a $13,800 security
system outside North's suburban Virginia home.
   Secord also faces charges of lying to the 1987 congressional
hearings on the Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>11-Year-Old Pilot in Iceland on Round-the-World Trip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weary Tony Aliengena, the boy pilot
from Southern California who is attempting to become the youngest
person to fly around the world, landed his small Centurion airplane
in Iceland early Saturday.
   ``I'm tired and I'm really glad to be here as this is one of the
longest legs of the trip,'' the 11-year-old aviator said at
Reykjavik airport.
   He said the five-hour flight from Sondrestrom, Greenland, was
especially difficult because the plane had to buck strong easterly
winds.
   Tony landed his single-engine Cessna 210 turboprop at 2:20 a.m.
(10:20 p.m. EDT Friday) after the journey across the Denmark Strait,
one of the most dangerous stages of his planned epic.
   He said he was ready for a day of rest before heading eastward.
   ``Today we are going to relax and go fishing,'' the boy said.
   ``I second that,'' said his father, Gary Aliengena, who sits
beside him on the flight.
   Everyone involved seemed to be hungry.
   The pilot of a second plane accompanying Tony, with the boy's
mother Susan, 10-year-old sister Alaina and a party of journalists,
was eating what he described as a two-day-old pizza.
   Alaina got out some bread and peanut butter and made herself a
sandwich as she waited for her brother to arrive.
   The third aircraft in the party, carrying a film crew, had to
turn back to Greenland because of a problem with the plane's
gyroscope, the group said.
   Tony said he would not be collecting any local signatures to add
to the 800-foot scroll of signatures he is carrying for presentation
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev later this month.
   The scroll bears the signatures of an estimated 200,000 U.S.
schoolchildren and Tony also has letters from the American
youngsters to children in the Soviet Union.
   Tony's father, a real estate investor and devoted pilot who
taught his son to fly while Tony sat on his lap, said they probably
will resume their flight on Sunday morning, heading for Oslo,
Norway. From there they fly to Sweden, the Soviet Union and onward
to Alaska and home.
   Tony set out June 5 from John Wayne Airport at Costa Mesa,
Calif., for the 19,000-mile ``goodwill flight'' dubbed Friendship
Flight '89.

<HEAD>Congressmen Ask Bush, Baker For POW Investigation</HEAD>

   A group of 40 congressmen are asking the Bush
administration to investigate a Japanese monk's claims that he
shared a prison cell with three captive American soldiers and had
seen as many as 10 American prisoners while in Vietnam.
   In a letter sent Friday to President Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, the congressmen urged ``a thorough investigation
of this recent account of American POWs in Vietnam.''
   Iwanobu Yoshida, a 65-year-old Buddhist monk imprisoned for 14
years before his release in January, is being treated in a Sapporo
hospital on the island of Hokkaido for physical and mental disorders
stemming from his imprisonment. His daughter, Keiko Takatsuka, has
been interpreting for him because he suffers from a speech
impediment.
   ``Every resource available should be used to determine the fate
of our POWs and MIAs in Vietnam,'' the letter from the congressmen
said. ``We ask you to do all that you can to bring an end to this
uncertainty.''
   Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., said: ``We have been informed that a
U.S. military attache interviewed the monk a few days ago,''
``However, the administration has elected not to disclose any
information from the meeting at this time.''
   Lisa Zywokarte, a Saxton aide, said officials with the State
Department confirmed that the United States plans to send another
military attache to meet with Yoshida. The first meeting was Monday.
   Yoshida said he recalled seeing ``young and healthy'' Americans
in the prison, but could not remember their names.
   The Vietnamese Embassy in Tokyo has denied Yoshinda's claims,
saying Hanoi holds no prisoners from the war that ended in 1975.
   However, the U.S. government has been pressing for information on
the 2,364 Americans listed as missing in action.
   Yoshida became a monk in 1966, leaving his family behind when he
emigrated to Vietnam to set up a temple in Saigon. He became a South
Vietnamese citizen in 1973 and was arrested in 1975 after North
Vietnamese forces took control of South Vietnam. International human
rights groups secured his release on Jan. 20.

   BANIYAS, Israeli-annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ U.S. and Israeli
archaeologists have unearthed a Roman metropolis that in its heyday
was the ancient world's equivalent of New York.
   Founded in about A.D. 10 by Herod Philip, son of King Herod the
Great, ancient Baniyas grew over the next several hundred years
``into a huge city,'' archaeologist Vassilios Tzarferis of the
Israel Antiquities Department recently said.
   ``We can estimate the population in Roman times of up to 15,000
people, which for those days means it was a New York,'' Tzarferis
said.
   Traces of ruined villas can be found a mile from the city center,
he said.
   Herod Philip chose the site near the source waters of the Jordan
River and next to a cave where pagans worshiped Pan, the goat-like
god of the shepherds. The cave is part of a national park that today
is a favorite site for picnics.
   He named his city in honor of Emperor Augustus Caesar, but it
became known as Caesarea Philipi to distinguish it from the port of
Caesarea constructed by his father on the Mediterranean Sea.
   American teams working at the site this year have partially
uncovered a dozen 30-foot-high arches that formed one side of what
appears to be a long shopping mall, said John Wilson, an archaeology
professor from Pepperdine College in Southern California.
   The arches now are the bottom layer of a wedding cake of history.
Wilson said Crusader conquerers 1,000 years later built a citadel on
top. In the 13th or 14th century Mameluke raiders from Egypt added a
palace.
   ``On top of it all was a Syrian village,'' Wilson said. Baniyas
was part of Syria until the Golan Heights region was taken by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981.
   Diggers have uncovered a public gate dating to the 1st century
and a 2nd or 3rd century house with mosaic floors, one of which is
largely intact.
   Wilson said ``we are encouraged there may be considerable
sections of ancient Baniyas that are preserved.'' But he estimated
it would take up to 10 years with as many as 100 people working each
digging season to expose a substantial part of the city.
   Historians and archeologists had many clues to the city's
location, Wilson said.
   ``The Pan cave with niches and inscriptions appears exactly on
coins of the 2nd and early 3rd century that say they are from
Baniyas,'' Wilson said. ``There are other coins with pictures of
buildings, which we feel are as accurate, and that's what we're
looking for.''
   The area is referred to as ``Paneon'' by the Jewish historian
Josephus, who says Herod the Great built a white stone temple to
Roman Emperor Augustus there.
   For years, it was strategically important because it controlled
the road from Damascus to the sea, Wilson said. It lost its
importance after Ottoman Turks took control, he said.
   In addition to Pepperdine, the other American colleges that sent
students to work at Baniyas this year were Averett College of
Danville, Va., and Hardin-Simmons University and Abilene Christian
College, both of Abilene, Texas.

<HEAD>Some U.S. Enterprises Succeed in Japan, Chamber Official Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite tension over Japanese market barriers
and the U.S. trade deficit, some major U.S. companies are doing well
in Japan and expect to prosper there through the rest of the
century, says the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Japan.
   The U.S. company, International Business Machines, is the largest
single exporter of computers from Japan, while ``the largest
restaurant company in Japan is MacDonald's and the largest beverage
company is Coca-Cola, Japan,'' accounting for between 25 and 50
percent of the U.S. parent company's worldwide profit last year,
said Chamber President William E. Franklin.
   He told reporters Friday his own company, Kodak, has opened a
$100 million research center in Yokohama in anticipation of more
business.
   America ``was the No. 1 foreign investor in Japan over the last
five years, with an average annual return of 20 percent,'' said
Franklin, who was attending the annual Washington gathering of U.S.
chamber of commerce executives based in Asia and the Pacific.
   He said it ``could help improve our trade problems by focusing on
some of these success stories, and if other companies knew that some
companies do very well in Japan and, I think, will continue to do
well between now and the end of the century.''
   Americans ``should not lose sight of the enormous progress
represented by a huge increase in one year'' of one-third more
Japanese imports from the United States, and removal of most of
Japan's import tariffs, Franklin said.
   Japan's average tariff is down to 2 percent, the lowest of any
advanced country, he said, adding, ``now there needs to be great
urgency to remove non-tariff barriers,'' figuring in the continuing
trade conflict. A major such barrier, he said, is the monopoly over
domestic markets by existing Japanese companies, creating entry
problems for newcomers, Japanese or foreign.
   The two countries are currently discussing the structural
background of the trade imbalance, which some economists say plays a
bigger role than market access. Structural problems include exchange
rates and distribution systems, low Japanese consumption and high
savings, and high U.S. debt and low U.S. savings and investment.
   Franklin did not take issue with the U.S. government's action
under the new ``Super 301'' trade law last month designating
Japanese restrictions on imports of lumber, supercomputers and
satellites as unfair trade to be subjected to investigation,
negotiation and possible U.S. retaliation.
   Congress reflects public attitudes, he said, and ``given what I
perceive to be the feeling of Congress, nothing could have been done
to avoid Japan being named after the law passed.''
   The United States had a $55 million trade deficit with Japan last
year, described as intolerable and unsustainable by U.S. government
officials and members of Congress.

<HEAD>Two Makers of Cheap Wine Pulls Brands from Seedy Neighborhood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second maker of inexpensive, high-alcohol
wines is pulling the product from stores shelves in the city's seedy
Tenderloin district, although some people doubt the move will curb
alcoholism.
   The manufacturer of Richard's Wild Irish Rose on Friday announced
it was joining E.&amp;J. Gallo in removing cheap wine from the
neighborhood's stores. Gallo said Wednesday it would stop selling
such brands as Thunderbird and Night Train Express to retailers in
the Tenderloin _ San Francisco's Skid Row _ for six months.
   The action came after area distributer Gallo-Bay Cities, owned by
Gallo, met with a group dubbed Safe and Sober Streets that has asked
grocers to stop selling such wines in the neighborhood.
   The group says it is tired of tripping over wine bottles and
being menaced by drunks.
   Thunderbird, Night Train Express and Richard's Wild Irish Rose
are three of the best-selling brands of fortified wines, which are
18 percent alcohol. Regular wine is about 12 percent.
   On Friday, the Canandaigua Wine Co., maker of Richard's Wild
Irish Rose, said the company would no longer sell that brand in the
Tenderloin.
   ``Given our company's position and the specifics of this
situation, we will participate in this program and discontinue
distribution in this area,'' the Canandaigua, N.Y.-based company
said.
   The statement, read by a secretary who would not give her name,
did not say how long the program would last.
   The high-alcohol wines are typically made from the cheapest
ingredients, then mixed with grape brandy to increase the alcoholic
content. They sell for about 90 cents to $1.25 a bottle, typically a
fifth of a gallon.
   ``After I got the news from Gallo, I ordered 250 cases of Wild
Irish Rose,'' Hatim Nassar, owner of Empire Liquor and Grocery, said
Friday.
   Nassar said he is worried that the Gallo pullout will last longer
than six months. He said he has stocked up on a six-month supply of
the Gallo brands and raised the price of each bottle 25 cents.
   ``This is my bread and butter,'' said Nassar, who estimated he
sells about 200 bottles of the cheap wines each day. ``If I don't
continue to sell this, I will have to close my doors and go home.''
   Liquor store owner Peter Wong said he isn't concerned. ``Some
were sorry to see it go, but there's other comparable brands''
people can buy, he said.
   Some of the Tenderloin's hard-drinking crowd hangs out at
Boedeker Park, where the homeless sleep on the lawn and the smell of
urine permeates the air.
   They said the disappearance of the cheap wines won't reduce
alcoholism in the area.
   ``They gonna chip in their money and buy a big expensive
bottle,'' said one man who refused to give his name. ``You ain't
gonna stop a drinking man from drinking. If they don't drink in the
morning, they gonna have a seizure.''
   Allen Keys, 37, who said he goes to the park twice a week to play
ball and hang around, maintained that the district's denizens simply
will walk to another neighborhood, go to another store and bring
cheap wine back.
   Modesto-based Gallo has said if the experiment succeeds in
reducing alcoholism in the Tenderloin, the company will pull those
wines in other neighborhoods.
   Police Officer Bob Geary, who patrols the park, said the
manufacturers' decision against selling to neighborhood retailers is
a ``stopgap measure and an oversimplification of the problem.''
   He said he issues about 11 alcohol-related citations in the park
each day.
   ``I understand what the community is trying to do, but I still
feel that everyone in the free enterprise system has the right to
sell legal goods,'' he said. ``It would be more effective to have
closer policing of the selling of goods to intoxicants and
youngsters.''

   The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a

President Bush to be the Justice Department's civil rights chief.
   The hearing will be chaired by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman
of the panel's civil rights subcommittee, Jane Berman, committee
spokeswoman, said Friday.
   The nomination is opposed by several civil rights groups that
contend Lucas, a black Republican, lacks the legal and professional
experience to be assistant attorney general for civil rights.
   Lucas, formerly sheriff and later chief executive of Wayne
County, Mich., said on a committee questionnaire that he has never

   The Soviet Union will not be able to buy U.S.
soybean oil at subsidized prices, at least not at this time, the
Agriculture Department says.
   Department officials had been under pressure for some time to
sell Moscow vegetable oil under the Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP, which provides subsidies to exporters who then can sell
commodities at reduced prices to designated overseas buyers.
   A one-paragraph statement issued Friday by the department said:
   ``After careful review based upon the criteria and objectives of
the Export Enhancement Program as well as other proposals, the
(department) will not offer a subsidized (EEP) sale of vegetable oil
to the Soviet Union at this time.''

<HEAD>California Is Top Farm Export State Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California was the top farm export state in
1988 for the fourth consecutive year, the Agriculture Department
said.
   Estimates by the department's Economic Research Service had put
California at the top of the U.S. farm export heap for the first
time in 1985. Until then, since the rankings began in the 1960s,
Iowa or Illinois had led.
   ``Fruits, nuts and vegetables accounted for 65 percent of
California's exports,'' the report released Friday said.
``California was the largest supplier of these crops and of seeds.
Total exports of $3.39 billion were the highest for a single state
since Iowa's $3.41 billion in 1982.''
   Only the top 10 states were reported. Those were said to account
for 59 percent of total U.S. exports, which were valued at $35.3
billion in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30.
   Iowa replaced Illinois for the No. 2 spot for 1988 export value,
the report showed. Illinois dropped to third. Kansas was fourth,
replacing Nebraska, while Texas was fifth and Nebraska sixth.
Minnesota was ranked seventh; Indiana, eighth; Ohio, ninth; and
Missouri, 10th.
   In fiscal 1987, the rankings were: California, Illinois, Iowa,
Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Minnesota, Indiana, North Dakota and Ohio.

   The American Legion said it has received a
$548,000 grant from the Agent Orange fund to develop programs for
helping families of Vietnam veterans, especially those with
developmentally disabled children.
   The money also will be used for programs of counseling and
support for families of Vietnam veterans suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder and problems with substance abuse.
   Pilot programs will be established in the first year in Kansas,
Kentucky, New York and Pennsylvania where, the Legion said, it
estimates there are 93,000 ``at risk'' veterans. Plans are to
replicate the referral networks throughout the country eventually.
   The grant is from the Agent Orange Class Assistance Program,
established by a federal court in New York, to distribute $52
million over a period of seven to 10 years to meet the needs of
Vietnam veterans and their families.

<HEAD>Justice Department Objects To 48 Georgia Judgeships</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has objected to Georgia
laws that had created two judicial circuits and 48 elected Superior
Court judgeships over the past 24 years.
   The action was disclosed in a letter to state officials from
James P. Turner, an acting assistant attorney general in the civil
rights division. Under the 1965 Civil Rights Act, the objection
renders the laws legally unenforceable until the department's
objection is withdrawn or overturned in court.
   But Deborah Burstion-Wade, a spokeswoman for the civil rights
division, said Friday the department's objection does not prevent
the 48 sitting judges from continuing to fulfill their duties, nor
does it provide a basis for challenging their past decisions.
   The Voting Rights Act requires that Georgia and other Southern
states submit all voting or election changes to the Justice
Department, which must determine that the changes have neither a
racially discriminatory purpose nor effect before they can take
effect.
   The 48 judgeships covered by the department's objection Friday _
out of 137 total Superior Court judgeships in the state _ all were
created since passage of the Voting Rights Act.

   Five of the original seven Mercury
astronauts marked the 30th anniversary of the launching of the
nation's manned space program with a plea to save Earth.
   Scott Carpenter said on Friday that the Soviet Union has moved
ahead of the United States in space exploration, but added: ``Maybe
that's OK.''
   He said the world is being united ``by a common foe _ the health
of this planet. We no longer should think about spending money to go
to Mars. We need to make this planet one that will flourish.''
   That, he said, ``has more priority, in my view, than beating the
Soviets to Mars.''
   Wally Schirra suggested that countries work together on a space
station and satellites that could observe things such as weather
patterns in a project he called ``Mission to Planet Earth.''
   ``We've definitely got to get concerned about spaceship Earth,''
he said. ``It's where we live. ... We don't need to go to Mars just
yet.''
   Carpenter and Schirra were joined by Alan Shepard, Gordon Cooper
and Donald ``Deke'' Slayton at a news conference at the University
of North Carolina's Morehead Planetarium to celebrate several
anniversaries, including next month's 20th anniversary of the first
moon landing.
   This year also marks the 30th anniversary of their becoming the
nation's first astronauts and the start of the U.S. manned space
program.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, was unable to attend events Friday but
was expected to join the group today. Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, one of
the original seven astronauts, was killed Jan. 27, 1967, in a fire
aboard Apollo I.
   The Mercury space program consisted of six flights from 1961 to
1963, including the first U.S. manned flight with Shepard in 1961
and the first U.S. manned orbital flight with Glenn in 1962.
   The seven astronauts trained at the planetarium beginning in
February 1960.
   ``Since I spent the least amount of time here, I was the fastest
learner,'' Shepard said.
   The astronauts also were having their annual reunion to raise
money for the Mercury Seven Foundation, which they founded as a
scholarship program for college students interested in careers in
scientific or engineering fields.
   The training at the planetarium was important, Shepard said,
because ``no one really knew what to expect in space in those days.''
   Said Slayton: ``In the Mercury program, everything was a total
unknown.''
   Tony Jenzano, then director of the planetarium, recalled the
program's start, when officials didn't want more than two astronauts
together and didn't want them to congregate in one place.
   ``But there was a terrible, sporadic snowstorm that trapped them
here for five to six days,'' he recalled.
   In all, 65 astronauts trained at the planetarium, ending with
Slayton in 1973.
   Slayton was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts but was
grounded because of a heart problem in 1962. He returned to flight
status 10 years later and went into space in 1975 with the
Apollo-Soyuz project. That was the first meeting in space between
U.S. astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts.
   The space program has changed much since the days of space
capsules and moved into the day of space shuttles, but despite the
romanticism often associated with space, Schirra said, flights can
often be boring.
   ``When you spend 24 hours a day in orbit, there's not a lot you
can do,'' he said.
   Slayton said interest in the space program has diminished since
it moved away from interplanetary flight.
   Landing on the moon is ``a very tough act to follow. There's only
one moon and you can land on it first only once,'' he said.

   After each had experienced two failed
marriages, Ella Crane and Christopher Nelson decided to make their
wedding a Whopper.
   They were married at a Burger King in a ceremony during which the
bride shoved a Whopper hamburger in the groom's mouth instead of
wedding cake.
   Nelson first set eyes on Ms. Crane about a year ago at the
fast-food eatery, where she is manager.
   ``This is her second home. If anyone would get married here,
Ella's definitely the one to do it,'' said Peggy Volpe, an assistant
manager.
   Mayor Patricia Harper said she used the ``standard verbiage''
uniting Ms. Crane and Nelson, both 34, on Thursday afternoon.
   ``My crew is my family, too, and I wanted them there,'' said Ms.
Crane, who has worked at the restaurant since 1977.
   More than 100 people crowded into the Burger King, including old
customers, people coming in for a quick meal, the regional manager
and employees, Ms. Volpe said.
   The bride arrived in a limousine, and a tape of ``Here Comes The
Bride'' began as she walked down the aisle past the soda machine.

   A woman gave birth to a boy on a stalled subway
train, and the Transit Authority foreman who helped suggested that
she ``name the kid `C Train''' after the vehicle in which he was
born.
   But she quickly thought better of it and named the boy after him.
   ``There's so many negative things happening on the trains these
days. And a perfect stranger. He was a really nice guy,'','' the
32-year-old mother, Kathy Quiles, said from her hospital bed.
   Mother and child _ 7-pound, 2-ounce Joseph Ramiro Casiano _ were
in good condition. A hospital spokeswoman said the child was in
isolation only because he was born outside of the hospital and had
initial difficulties.
   Ms. Quiles said she was hurrying home after a clinic visit Friday
because she thought she was going to go into labor. She was with her
husband, Ramiro Casiano, who had assisted in the births of their six
other children.
   The brakes on the train on which they were riding malfunctioned,
and maintenance supervisor Joseph Caracciolo was trying to check on
his men working down the line, when he asked a conductor what was
going on.
   It was apparent the pregnant woman was going to give birth.
Caracciolo, two teen-age girls and a woman assisted.
   Once the baby was born, Caracciolo demanded that the train get

   A Massachusetts Army National Guard
helicopter crashed in dense fog early Saturday, killing at least six
people, police said.
   Police Sgt. Paul Rooney said all those aboard the UH-1H
helicopter were killed when the chopper crashed in woods in a
residential neighborhood.
   ``There could be as many as 10,'' victims, he said.
   Rooney said he heard the helicopter flying around the area at
least half an hour before it crashed, and several neighbors also
called police to report hearing it flying low overhead and then
hearing a crash.
   Rooney said authorities had been in contact with Otis Air Force
Base on Cape Cod, but had not been able to confirm where the
helicopter came from or what its mission was.
   In Boston, Coast Guard Lt. Commander Ted Ohr confirmed that the
chopper crashed about 12:10 a.m. Yarmouth is on Cape Cod, about 85
miles south of Boston.
   State police Trooper Ellen Engelhardt in the South Yarmouth
barracks said state police, the Federal Aviation Administration and
Yarmouth police were on the scene, and a representative of the
National Guard was en route.
   Engelhardt also had no word on casualties, but said preliminary
reports were that no one had survived the crash.
   The crash site is roughly 30 miles from the air force base, she
said.

<HEAD>Judge Releases Older Couple Who Robbed Bank to Pay Mortgage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has freed an older couple who robbed a bank
at gunpoint because they couldn't afford their mortgage payments.
   Herbert Butler, 65, and his wife Eleni, 61, admitted holding up a
London bank last New Year's Eve in an effort to meet mortgage
payments of $2,140 a month. They receive a monthly pension of $41.
   In Friday's decision, Judge Raymond Dean in Old Bailey Court gave
the Butlers a two-year suspended sentence and let them go.
   ``You are both of retirement age and must have been quite
desparate to embark on that course of action,'' he said.
   The judge said he was convinced Butler did not intend to use the
gun he carried during the robbery and that they would not rob again.
   The Butlers wore ski masks and wigs during the robbery. When they
demanded money, the teller reportedly said, ``Don't be silly.''
   But Butler brandished his gun, and the teller handed over nearly
$3,800 in cash.
   The couple fled in a vehicle, but police arrested them at a
traffic light.
   According to court testimony, Butler told the officers: ``All
right, all right, you have caught us. But take it easy on her, she
has heart trouble.''
   The couple left court without comment Friday. Their lawyer said
they ``are delighted with the result and just want to start a new
life,'' according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency.

<HEAD>Weeks of Syrian Shelling Leaves Christian Enclave a Ghost Town</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOUNIEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 12 weeks of shelling by Syrian
forces, this once-bustling Christian enclave north of Beirut has
become a ghost town.
   The daily artillery fire, which drove most of its 1 million
residents into underground bunkers and shelters, has sapped the life
from an area once called the Monte Carlo of the Middle East.
   Although the intensity of shellfire has eased since the Arab
League called for a cease-fire May 11, the Christians _ outnumbered
and outgunned by Syria and its allies _ have been paralyzed by an
acute gasoline shortage.
   ``If it's not shelling, it's gas and if it's not gas it's
something else,'' said Samira Khater, a secretary.
   There is hardly any traffic on the roads. Few people are able to
drive to work.
   Half the shops, hidden behind sandbags and earth-filled oildrums,
are shuttered.
   Factories that survived the ferocious shelling limp along with
skeleton staffs and whatever fuel they can scrounge.
   Restaurants are lucky if they get 10 customers a day.
   And the night life that once throbbed in the clubs, bars and
restaurants along the Mediterranean coastline is dead.
   Closed is the famous Casino du Liban overlooking Jounieh Bay, 12
miles north of Beirut, where oil-rich sheiks from the Persian Gulf
and high-rollers from around the world once gambled.
   It was a regular target for the Syrian gunners who have battled
the forces of Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun since March 8 in
some of the most savage artillery and rocket battles of Lebanon's
14-year civil war.
   About 360 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded,
mostly civilians.
   The Christians are tired and dispirited, struggling to cope with
a grim fatalism.
   The cease-fire, violated daily by the Syrians, had raised
people's hopes they would be able to pick up the pieces of their
shattered lives and find some semblance of normality.
   Instead, there's a stillness punctuated only by the periodic
crump of exploding shells.
   The Syrians maintain their blockade of the Christian enclave,
ringed on its landward sides by hostile Moslem forces.
   Small cargo ships run the gauntlet of shellfire to bring in food
and ammunition for the besieged Christians. Until a few days ago,
the blockade runners didn't try bringing in gas.
   ``It only takes one hit to blow up a ship loaded with fuel,'' a
police spokesman said. ``So no one dares take the risk.''
   One small tanker, the 1,507-ton Chemicoral, made a run Thursday
with 660,000 gallons of gasoline. But it was hit by Syrian shellfire
and its cargo burned.
   Others than gas, there are no real shortages, thanks to the
blockade runners.
   Supermarkets bulge with imported goods _ pink chamapagne, passion
fruit tea, whisky, cookies, chocolates, hams, cheeses.
   Fruit and vegetables are in short supply, but available for a
price. Before the fighting, most produce came from Syrian-controlled
areas. Now they're smuggled in at night by muletrain from the north.
   The enclave's fuel reserves went up in flames when a Syrian
barrage blew up the seaside Dora depot in east Beirut two months ago.
   The French, Lebanon's colonial rulers until 1943 and the
Christians' traditional protector, shipped in 4,000 tons of fuel to
reactivate shut-down power plants a few weeks ago.
   There's so little gasoline around that only about one-fifth of
the filling stations bother to open.
   Police said two people have been killed and 10 wounded in
gunfights over gas.
   ``People have to wait for days in front of the stations and all
they get in the end is 10 liters (2.25 gallons),'' one attendant
said.
   A half-tank at filling stations costs $50, a month's wages for
many Lebanese.
   One motorist noted: ``Filling station owners pump out the gas
from their tanks and sell it on the black market for 10 times the
price.''
   Long lines of cars, some extending a mile, stand outside many
filling stations.
   ``At first, everyone used to wait for days in their cars, even
during the shelling,'' grocer Samir Madi said. ``Now we take it in
turns to wait for a station to open.
   ``When it does, whoever's keeping vigil telephones everyone else
and they all rush to the station.''
   Bank clerk Samar Moallem, who earns $60 a month, hasn't gone to
work for weeks.
   ``I don't have any gas,'' she said. ``I can't afford to pay my
whole salary for 20 liters or pay ($2 a day) for taxis getting to
and from work. I told the bank if they want me they'll have to get
me gas.''

<HEAD>Bishops Consider Support of Renewed Relations With Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Catholic Catholic Church is
trying to heal the wounds left by the Vietnam War, but some bishops
fear support of renewed relations with Vietnam may grant legitimacy
to its communist government.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops was scheduled to vote
today on a proposal for normalizing relations with Vietnam.
   The Committee on International Policy of the United States
Catholic Conference is recommending the church support the proposal.
The annual spring meeting of the nation's bishops opened Friday at
Seton Hall University with debate on the proposal by the committee,
which visited with Vietnamese bishops in January.
   Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, committee chairman, said the
committee did not seek to express approval of the Vietnamese regime,
but to work for improved relations that could lead to increased
humanitarian assistance and a more effective forum for expressing
concerns over violations of human rights and religious liberty.
   But some bishops said Vietnamese Americans are concerned the
church is granting legitimacy to a ``barbaric'' regime in return for
vague promises.
   Bishop Joseph J. Madera of Fresno, Calif., said the brother of a
priest in his diocese has spent 30 years in a Vietnamese prison.
   ``We have to hear not just the bishops of Vietnam, but also the
people who are affected in their daily lives,'' he said.
   Also Friday, the conference president declared relations have
never been better in recent years between the Vatican and the church
in the United States.
   ``I believe that the bridge between Rome and the United States is
stronger than it has been in recent memory,'' said Archbishop John
L. May of St. Louis.
   Archbishop Pio Laghi, the apostolic pro-nuncio who is the pope's
representative in the United States, agreed with May.
   ``Now we have a very good relationship,'' Laghi said. ``There is
a beautiful atmosphere now, very warm.''
   May said after his talk that ``a lot of eyes and a lot of ears''
have been opened in Rome following a series of encounters with U.S.
bishops, including the pope's visit in 1987, meetings with
individual bishops last year, and a March meeting of cardinals and
archbishops with Vatican officials.
   Other bishops agreed there is a new era in relations with the
Vatican.
   ``We all learned from our experiences,'' said Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin of Chicago, who helped resolve a dispute involving Seattle
Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen, who was unilaterally stripped by the
Vatican of some of his ecclesial authority for alleged doctrinal
abuses. Most of his authority was later restored after U.S. bishops
intervened.
   In a test of their new relationship, the bishops were scheduled
to vote today on a document that proposes ways to resolve disputes
between bishops and theologians. The proposal from the bishops'
Committee on Doctrine has been criticized by the Vatican for
appearing to place bishops and theologians on equal levels.
   In March, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome,
said the proposed document on ``Doctrinal Responsibilities,'' which
advocates the ``rights'' of theologians to lawful freedom of inquiry
and expression of scholarly opinion, ``tends logically to the
erection of a second teaching authority in the Church.''
   Today, the committee of bishops was also to present a progress
report on an AIDS policy that will be debated and voted on at a
future conference. It had been planned months ago to present the
report and open it up to debate and a possible vote at the Seton
Hall conference, said the Rev. Kenneth Doyle spokesman for the
conference.
   He said, however, that the report was not far enough along to be
debated, and the report would consist only of an estimated timetable
for its completion.

<HEAD>DOE Announces Improved Monitoring of Rocky Flats Plutonium Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department plans to commit $1.8 million
a year to improve monitoring of the troubled Rocky Flats plutonium
plant and to purchase $730,000 worth of monitoring equipment.
   The federal government also assured Gov. Roy Romer on Friday that
the state will be able to independently monitor activity at the
plant, which is under investigation for safety violations.
   The promise was part of an agreement reached by Energy Department
Deputy Director Henson Moore and Romer following the governor's
threat last week to shut down the plant.
   At a news conference, Moore and Romer announced the agreement,
which must be ratified by Energy Secretary James Watkins.
   ``We are going to operate on the basis that people need to know
the truth, and we are going to get it to them in a way in which it
is verified independently of the operation of the plant,'' Romer
said. ``My policy has been we've got to clean it up _ or close it
down.''
   Rocky Flats, located 16 miles northwest of Denver, manufactures
plutonium detonators for nuclear bombs. Rockwell International
operates the plant for the Energy Department.
   On June 6, scores of FBI agents and Environmental Protection
Agency investigators raided the plant looking for evidence of
illegal dumping and incineration of hazardous wastes.
   The on-site investigation continued Friday.
   Under Friday's agreement, the Energy Department will provide
additional technical and financial support for state environmental
oversight, monitoring, repair, emergency response and health-related
initiatives.
   The department said it will accelerate cleanup where
contamination presents a threat. It also will monitor surface waters
and treated drinking water, streams entering reservoirs, samples of
discharges and underground water under the agreement.
   Moore said the Bush administration wants to send the message that
``environment, safety and health is not any longer `a factor' _ it
is the first priority in the operation of any of our facilities.''
   The department will consent to penalties ``if we don't live up to
the agreement with the governor's office,'' said Moore.
   Asked about the department's historical ``lack of candor'' about
reporting incidents at the plant, Moore snapped at a reporter: ``I
don't lie to people, fella! Not to you, not to him (the governor),
not to anybody else. You just watch what we do.''
   He said if Rockwell ``cannot assure the plant is being run in a
safe manner ... then they are not to produce,'' he said.
   Sam F. Iacobellis, president of Rockwell International Aerospace
Operations, hailed the agreement. ``We have long urged similar
actions and fully support the governor's initiative,'' he said.
   He also denied allegations in an FBI affidavit that Rocky Flats
illegally operated an incinerator at night in a building closed by
Energy Department inspectors. Iacobellis also said there was no
deliberate ``midnight dumping'' of wastes at Rocky Flats.
   Energy Department officials said Friday that new tests show
drinking water in northwest metropolitan Denver is uncontaminated by
chemicals the FBI suspects were dumped into creeks at Rocky Flats.
Some of the creeks empty into reservoirs used as municipal water
supplies.
   Romer earlier threatened to close the plant unless the department
stepped up its environmental monitoring at the site and made the
results available to him.

<TEXT>
   A Delta Air Lines jetliner en route to Atlanta hit
turbulence that sent passengers flying and seven people were
hospitalized, most with broken bones.
   About 25 people were taken to four hospitals after Delta Flight
102 hit air turbulence over Alabama, about 200 miles northwest of
Atlanta. All but seven were treated and released. The L-1011 was
carrying 282 passengers from Seattle to Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport.
   The plane was at about 25,000 feet when the turbulence occurred.
It landed at Hartsfield Airport about 3:45 p.m. Friday, said Delta
spokesman Jim Lundy.
   Passengers on the flight said the pilot told them at the start of
the trip that it was his last flight after 33 years of flying.
   One of the plane's uninjured passengers, Linda Alexander of
Seattle, said that only those who weren't wearing seat belts were in
danger.
   ``As it (the plane) dropped, anyone not fastened in went up and a
lot of people were flying through the air,'' she said.
   Delta spokeswoman Glenda Hatchett Johnson said the seat-belt
light was on at the time.
   ``The kids were screaming and the food was flying and the people
were flying,'' said Brenda Chevalier of Seattle, who was treated for
a sprained back.
   ``It's like you're on a roller coaster and at the top of a hill,
the way your stomach feels,'' she said. ``We dropped thousands of
feet. There's no control _ you've lost it. I thought I was going to
die. I kept screaming, `God, please be with us.' ''
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker said that
although passengers felt they were falling a great distance, ``it
was probably more like a two-second free fall that seemed like 20
seconds.''
   The FAA had no measurement of how far the plane fell.
   Ann Renner, a spokeswoman at South Fulton Hospital, said one
passenger was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit in
serious condition with broken ribs and four others were being kept
at the hospital, most for broken bones. She would not identify any
of the patients.
   A Shallowford Hospital official said one passenger was
hospitalized in stable condition with a concussion. Another was
being kept for observation at Georgia Baptist Hospital.
   The hospitals treated and released other passengers Friday night.
   Ms. Johnson said several more passengers were treated by
paramedics at the airport for bruises.
   Meantime, passengers aboard a Northwest Airlines flight en route
from Seattle to Detroit on Friday remained calm and were uninjured
during an unscheduled landing in Bismarck, N.D., after the
twin-engine Boeing 757 developed an oil leak in an engine. The plane
carried 182 passengers.

<HEAD>Rebels Followed Americans for Possible Assassination, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist rebels shadowed nine U.S.
servicemen assigned to Clark Air Base last year, apparently in
preparation for an assassination attempt, it was reported today.
   The Pacific Stars and Stripes, an unofficial U.S. military
newspaper, quoted Filipino authorities in Angeles City as saying
they learned of the surveillance through documents captured last
July from the communist New People's Army.
   According to the report, the rebels watched two U.S. Air Force
colonels, a lieutenant colonel, four captains, and two sergeants
assigned to the base in Angeles City.
   The newspaper quoted police Maj. Efren Alamares as saying the
nine were apparently targeted because they lived off post.
   Efforts to contact police in Angeles City were unsuccesful
because telephone lines there were out of order.
   Philippine rebels have sometimes attacked Americans in the past.
   Last April, they killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe as he
drove to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in the
Manila suburb of Quezon City.
   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino
civilian in coordinated ambushes outside Clark.
   The rebels have repeatedly threatened attacks on U.S. personnel
because of Washington's support of President Corazon Aquino's
counterinsurgency campaign.
   Capt. Donna Eggelston, Clark spokeswoman, said the Air Force
``periodically receives intelligence reports on terrorist activity.
   ``The report in question concerns information received in 1988,''
she said. ``Due to the sensitive nature of these reports, we do not
comment on them, and we do this to protect individuals who may be
involved.''
   She refused to say whether the nine personnel are still assigned
to Clark or to describe their duties.
   About 40,000 American troops, civilians and military dependents
are stationed at six U.S. military installations in the Philippines.
   More than half are stationed at Clark in central Luzon, the main
Philippine island. Rebels are strong in the area.
   The New People's Army has been waging a 20-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.

<HEAD>Report: Nine Killed When Pirates Attack Refugee Boat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine refugees were killed when
modern-day pirates in a speedboat raided a boat full of Filipinos, a
newspaper reported today.
   The New Straits Times, quoting police sources in Sabah state,
said the attack took place Wednesday near Pulau Gaya island. It said
the boat was carrying 33 people, including 11 women and children.
   Such pirates have killed hundreds of refugees in Southeast Asian
waters this year. On April 16, pirates off Malaysia set fire to a
refugee boat and killed 130 Vietnamese in a rampage of rape,
shootings and clubbings, relief officials in Malaysia said.
   
   The survivors of the latest attack told police seven heavily
armed pirates in a speedboat approached their vessel and fired
several shots in the air, forcing the skipper to stop, the newspaper
said. The pirates came on board and cart away the refugee's cash and
valuables, it said.
   The pirates then forced nine males, including the skipper, to one
side of the boat and opened fire, killing them, the newspaper said.
The pirates escaped after breaking the boat's rudder, the report
said.
   Fishermen rescued the survivors Thursday when they heard cries
for help, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>County To Dismantle Its Homesteading Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INTERNATIONAL FALLS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A northern Minnesota county is
withdrawing its offer of free land to would-be homesteaders because
of complaints from longtime residents and legal and financial snags.
   Commissioners of Koochiching County decided this week to stop
taking applications for land after Sept. 1, almost three years
earlier than planned.
   ``It hasn't been a failure at all,'' said Commissioner Larry
Chezick. ``I just don't think we ever had visions of how the media
would portray this.''
   The rural county along the Canadian border began the program two
years ago, hoping that up to 40 acres of free land would attract
modern-day pioneers and offset declines in population, school
enrollment and the local economy.
   It is believed to be the first such land-giveaway since the 19th
century federal homesteading program that populated much of the
nation, and it attracted intense coverage from newspapers, magazines
and television stations around the globe that didn't want to miss a
once-in-a-century story.
   In the wake of the publicity whirlwind, more than 10,000 people
asked for information about the program from across the country and
as far afield as Europe and Japan. Hundreds visited the county to
scout for a homestead and more than 250 submitted applications.
   Last winter, three homesteading hopefuls from Colorado were
arrested trying to break into an empty farmhouse. Another time, two
Germans wandered into the local Job Service office, saying they
intended to homestead and needed work.
   As a result, some of the county's slightly more than 16,000
residents complained that the giveaway would attract too many
undesireables to the area.
   The county also had to take back initial claims that 50,000 acres
of tax-forfeited county and state land were available because some
of the state land was held in trust.
   So far only two homesteads have been awarded, going to local men
who applied before the flood of outside interest. But one of the two
said he had trouble getting a loan to build a house. He couldn't use
his land as collateral because homesteaders only receive title to
their property after living on it for 10 years.
   Under the plan to halt the program this fall, at least 25 but no
more than 100 applicants will be given land. Jerry Andre, the
program administrator, said there are about 20 more applicants that
are likely to be approved.
   The county's disenchantment with the program has done little to
dampen the curiosity of people who want to homestead. ``They're
still coming through, more than ever,'' Andre said.

   A commercially sponsored TV show has been
banned from the state's high schools, dealing a second big blow to
the company that hopes to beam a daily newscast into the nation's
classrooms.
   The New York Board of Regents unanimously rejected Whittle
Communications' ``Channel One'' program Friday, saying they were
worried the ``active commercialization'' of the programs would send
the wrong message to high school students.
   ``It's a very tempting package that has a flaw,'' said state
Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol. ``That flaw is that it's wrong.
It's wrong legally, educationally, financially and morally.''
   Some regents also expressed anger with Whittle's aggressive
lobbying in support of ``Channel One.'' Edward Meyer charged that
some members of the education policy-setting board told him Whittle
had offered them jobs or consulting contracts if they supported the
project.
   Laura Eshbaugh, executive vice president for Whittle
Communications, said she knew nothing about any offers.
   Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle has said it needs to sign up 40
percent of the nation's high schools if ``Channel One'' is to
succeed. The first severe blow to that goal was delivered earlier
this month, when California officials threatened their schools with
a loss of funds if they signed with Whittle.
   Eshbaugh said she was disappointed with the New York board's
decision, but said ``Channel One'' would survive the rejection.
   Whittle had increased its offer to the regents and taken its case
to the public in the days leading to Friday's board meeting. The
company ran full-page advertisements in The New York Times and Meyer
said some Regents were bombarded by ``junk fax'' messages in support
of Whittle.
   In return for an agreement to show the daily programs, Whittle
had offered to wire high schools with complete closed-circuit
television systems, including satellite dishes, televisions and
videocassette recorders.
   As the regents' decision approached, Whittle officials offered to
donate 1,000 hours of satellite time so other educational
programming could be shown in schools, education department
officials said.
   But Whittle wouldn't change the most debated aspect of its
program: The 12-minute news program still had to contain two minutes
of commercials for candy, jeans, acne cream and other products aimed
at teen-agers.
   ``What it says to children is we don't care much about you,''
Sobol said, ``but we care what we can get out of you.''
   Several regents said they worried the commercials could cause
poor students who couldn't afford items advertised to feel
inadequate. They also said the program seems geared to suburban,
white students instead of the more troubled city schools that are in
dire need of the technology Whittle could provide.
   But Eshbaugh noted that schools contain many other forms of
advertising, such as wall posters, advertisements in yearbooks and
magazines and brand names emblazoned on the clothing students wear.
   ``Commercialization is there,'' she said. ``However any of us
might not like it there, it's there to stay.''
   The regents said the discussion with Whittle has caused them to
examine the extent of other advertising in school. The Education
Department will also look into other ways of getting more technology
and television programs into school, Sobol said.

<HEAD>Energy Department Undecided on Fernald Settlement After Losing Mock
Trial</HEAD>

   Energy Department officials intend to decide
whether a jury's ruling should prompt settlement of a lawsuit by the
Fernald uranium processing plant's neighbors, but a department
spokesmen declined to say when.
   In Washington, Energy Department spokesman Will Callicott was
non-committal Friday following a U.S. District Court jury's
non-binding recommendation that neighbors of the Feed Materials
Production Center be awarded $136 million in damages.
   The jury issued its ruling Thursday in the mock trial of a
class-action suit filed by 14,000 neighbors of the plant, which
processes uranium used in making the government's nuclear weapons.
   Neighbors claimed radioactive emissions from the plant have
damaged their health and the environment and lowered property values.
   The eight-member jury's verdict ended a summary jury trial, an
abbreviated procedure that Judge S. Arthur Spiegel used to encourage
a settlement of the neighbors' lawsuit against the former operator
of the Energy Department plant.
   Energy Department lawyer Henry Gill Jr. refused to say whether
the jury verdict would prompt a settlement offer. The residents'
lawyer, Stanley Chesley, said he would consider such an offer.
   Callicott said Gill was not due back in Washington until Monday,
and that Gill would have to confer with top department managers.
   The jury ruled that National Lead of Ohio Inc. operated the Feed
Materials Production Center in a way that caused neighbors to suffer
the distress and lowered property values they had claimed.
   The company operated the plant 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati
under contract to the federal government from 1951 through 1985.
Also named as a defendant was its parent company, National Lead
Industries Inc.
   The Energy Department defended the companies, arguing that they
could not be found liable because they carried out the government's
directions. The department admitted in documents filed with the
court that the government sometimes told National Lead of Ohio
managers to emphasize production and not to worry about
environmental protection or regulations.
   Gill said any settlement of the case would be paid by the
government because of an indemnification clause in its contract with
the operator. If there is no settlement, the case goes to a real
trial Aug. 15 before Spiegel, who presided at the shortened summary
trial.
   Chesley, representing the 14,000 plaintiffs who live within five
miles of the plant, said the jury's verdict amounted to a total
victory.
   Residents said in their lawsuit that radioactive contamination
from the plant has polluted soil, air and water, causing them mental
stress and making their homes undesirable.
   The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty
exhaust-air filters since the plant opened. Government lawyers said
the material has not endangered residents or harmed property.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, which has operated the plant
since January 1986, is not a defendant in the case.

   Four U.S. tourists and their Kenyan pilot
were killed when their airplane crashed in the forested Aberdares
mountains of central Kenya, authorities said today.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi confirmed the Friday
morning crash of the Air Kenya craft but declined to identify the
victims until next of kin had been notified.
   John Buckley, managing director of Air Kenya, said the crash of
the twin-engine Italian-made Partenavia occurred while on a flight
from the capital to the provincial town of Nyeri, 92 miles north.
   The English-language Daily Nation newspaper quoted witnesses
today as saying the aircraft crashed in bad weather about 12 miles
from its destination. Police needed a tractor to recover the bodies,
according to the newspaper.
   Buckley said the cause of the accident was under investigation by
the Directorate of Civil Aviation.

<HEAD>Former Official Denies Involvement in Journalist's Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former security chief accused in the murder
of an investigative journalist denied involvement in the slaying,
saying he wouldn't have rushed to the scene of the crime if he had
ordered the killing.
   Jose Antonio Zorrilla, 47, spoke with reporters after a witness
to the slaying of Manuel Buendia testified that he saw a man who
resembled the killer go into office of the Federal Security
Department days after the May 30, 1985, murder.
   Zorrilla, chief of the FBI-like department from 1982-84, listened
from behind bars in the courtroom for three hours while a court
official read Juan Manuel Bautista Ortiz, who was Buendia's office
aide, statements he had earlier made to authorities.
   Under questioning by the prosecutor Rafael Avanzi, Bautista said
the man he saw ``100 percent resembled'' the killer.
   During his testimony, Bautista also said Zorrilla arrived at the
scene with agents from his office about 15 minutes after Buendia was
shot, Bautista said.
   ``I was not going to be naive enough to go there immediately to
see what happened if I had been responsible,'' Zorrilla said. ``I
would have said `I'm not going.' It would have been infantile to go
to the place where it happened.''
   He said he was a friend of the journalist and went
target-shooting with him.
   Zorrilla pleaded innocent at his arraignment Thursday before
Judge Roberto Hernandez Martinez of Mexico City's 34th Penal Court
on homicide charges. Prosecutors have said he was the mastermind of
the crime.
   The judge has until Sunday to decide if the case has merit and
return a formal indictment.
   Zorrilla faces 40 years in prison on the homicide charge and 22
years on other accusations, including abuse of authority and weapons
charges.
   The former security security chief said he believed Buendia was
killed because of the front-page columns he wrote for the newspaper
Excelsior.
   He said he ``had touched on very delicate subjects.''
   In columns and books, Buendia wrote on corruption in high places,
drug trafficking, the CIA and gun-running.
   Witnesses questioned during the murder investigation also linked
Zorrilla to drug trafficking and Mexican narcotics kingpin Rafael
Caro Quintero. Zorrilla has denied such ties.
   Caro Quintero is awaiting trial in the killing of U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena Salazar and his
Mexican pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar in Guadalajara in 1985.

<HEAD>More Storms in East, Contribute to Four Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms continued to lash the East Coast, contributing to
at least four deaths, causing flooding in three states and knocking
out power to more than 100,000 consumers in South Carolina.
   Eight tornadoes were sighted in North Carolina and one in South
Carolina Friday, but no injuries or serious damages were reported
from the twisters. Hurricane-force winds gusting to 78 mph were
recorded in South Carolina.
   Winds downed trees and power lines, leaving an estimated 90,000
customers without power in the Columbia area and another 10,000 to
15,000 customers without power in other parts of the state, said
Brian Duncan, a spokesman for South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co.
   Duke Power Co. spokeswoman Mary Boyd said about 12,000 customers
were without power around Lancaster, Great Falls and Kershaw.
   Claudius W. Pender, 67, was killed when a tree fell on his truck
in Columbia, Richland County Chief Deputy Coroner Jim Anasti said.
   Elflist Nathaniel Smith, 21, was killed when a utility pole
crushed the roof of a car in which he was riding from Greensboro to
his hometown of Raleigh, authorities said.
   Rain swollen rivers and creeks wiped out bridges, chewed up
roads, flooded homes and contributed to two deaths in eastern
Kentucky, where up to five inches of rain fell Thursday and Friday.
At least 120 families were forced to seek dry ground, state
officials said.
   In Breathitt County, a 32-year-old man jumped into the
rain-swollen Kentucky River and was swept away. And in Madison
County, a 31-year-old man died after a car ran off a road and landed
in a swollen creek.
   In West Virginia, storms drove rivers up by as much as 14 feet
Friday and forced officials to evacuate the town of Dunlow and close
several highways.
   In Montgomery, Ala., where 6 inches of rain fell in four days,
firefighters used a boat Friday to rescue a bedridden woman and four
children from a wood-frame house, and several bridges on dirt roads
were ashed out in Geneva County.
   Thunderstorm winds also downed trees and power lines in central
Florida and Virginia.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued this morning from central
Florida to central North Carolina, with the strongest storms in
southeast Georgia.
   Showeres were numerous from the upper Ohio Valley and lower Great
Lakes into western New England. Dense fog was reported in Rhode
Island.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced baseball-size hail and wind
gusts to 76 mph in Wyoming Friday evening, and storm winds gusted to
71 mph at Rapid City, S.D.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued across central South Dakota
and western Nebraska early this morning, and over parts of the
southern Plains.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in the East
Coast, and from the northern and central Appalachians to Michigan.
Showers and thunderstorms also were forecast for the northern and
central Plains, Missouri and Oklahoma. Rain was expected across the
Pacific Northwest.
   Predicted highs: 70s and 80s in most of the nation; 60s in the
Pacific Northwest and parts of Michigan; 90s in Florida, and from
southwest Texas across New Mexico and southern Arizona to
California's interior valleys, with parts of southwest Texas getting
above 100 degrees; and up to 115 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 35 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 94 at Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   China expressed ``deep regret'' to Britain today
for delaying a meeting on the transition of Hong Kong to Chinese
rule.
   Britain put off the session of the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group on the future of Hong Kong, originally scheduled for next
month in London, to protest China's suppression of the pro-democracy
student movement. No new date has been set.
   In reaction, China said today that Britain ``will be held
responsible for all possible consequences.''
   The Foreign Ministry in its statement said it hopes Britain
remains committed to handing over Hong Kong in 1997 under an
agreement made in 1984, but added, ``We express our deep regret over
this irresponsible action taken by the British government.''
   Britain's Foreign Office has said it will honor the accord but
cannot conduct normal business at the moment ``as if nothing had
happened.''
   The pact returns Hong Kong to China in eight years but guarantees
that China will not interfere with its capitalist system for at
least 50 years.
   The current suppression of dissent on the mainland has raised
anxieties in the British colony about Chinese rule. Many Hong Kong
residents have demanded that Britain allow more of them to resettle
there.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said resettling all 3.25 million
British passport holders in Hong Kong is politically impossible. She
has instead pledged greater flexibility in existing arrangements,
particularly for those who worked for the British government.
   The Joint Liaison Group is supposed to meet three times a year to
work out details of the transition. Its second meeting this year had
been scheduled for July 18-21.

   Several moderate earthquakes struck an area of
Armenia that was devastated by an earthquake last year, but no new
casualties or damage were reported, the Tass news agency reported
today.
   Tremors measuring 3 to 5.5 on the 12-point Soviet earthquake
scale were recorded Friday in Kirovakan, Aparan, Razdan and
Leninakan, the region where nearly 25,000 people were killed in an
earthquake on Dec. 7, Tass said.
   An temblor of 5 points is capable of swaying buildings and
cracking walls but is not considered life-threatening, according to
Soviet seismic experts.
   Other tremors, registering up to 2.5 points, were recorded this
morning by the seismograph station in Kirovakan.
   ``These are secondary tremors in the given zone,'' Tass said.

   Palestinians in the occupied territories
launched another general strike today to protest Israel's Middle
East peace plan.
   According to Arab reports, the strike shut down the Gaza Strip
and principal West Bank cities.
   There were scattered clashes, and an 18-year-old Palestinian was
reported wounded in the West Bank, Arab reports said. They said the
army conducted raids on the West Bank villages of Osarin and Hawara
near Nablus, and about two dozen residents were reported beaten with
assault rifles.
   A Palestinian reporter in Gaza City, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said youths burned tires in the streets and threw rocks
at military vehicles.
   Strike pamphlets issued by the underground leaders of the
18-month uprising said the action was ``to call on the American
administration to hold an international conference, as it is the
only way to reach peace in the region.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan calls for Palestinian
elections in the West Bank and Gaza to be followed by negotiations
with the elected reprsentatives on a form of limited self-rule.
   He opposes a proposed international peace conference that would
be sponsored by the United Nations and would include the Middle East
parties directly involved and also the United States and Soviet
Union. Shamir has said such a conference would be biased against
Israel and demand territorial concessions that would jeopardize the
Jewish state.
   There was scattered violence in the occupied territories Friday.
   Arab reports said Israeli soldiers, battling stone-throwing
Palestinians in the Gaza town of Rafah, opened fire, killing three
people.
   Hospital officials in Rafah said 13 Arabs were wounded in the
clashes.
   The deaths raised to 520 the number of Palestinians killed in the
uprising that began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis have
perished in the violence.
   Reports identified the three slain men as Valid Omar Abu Abed,
23, Amir Fuad Nasser, 25, and 17-year-old Ahmed Abed Rabbo Abu Oun.
They said all three died from gunshot wounds.
   An Arab reporter in Jafah said the violence ``began with small
clashes after the (noon Moslem) prayers ... Then Abu Abed was killed
and protests escalated.''
   Shooting was heard in Rafah hours after dark and army
reinforcements were sent in.
   Rafah is under an indefinite curfew with the 50,000 residents
ordered to remain inside their homes.
   Four other Arabs were reported shot and wounded in clashes with
troops elsewhere in the Gaza Strip and the West Strip.
   Arab doctors said a 60-year-old Palestinian woman was wounded by
a rubber bullet and two Arab youths suffered injuries when they were
beaten during a battle outside a Gaza City detention center.
   An army spokesman said dozens of Palestinians waiting to visit
their jailed relatives rioted after being told the prisoners were on
a hunger strike and refused to see visitors. He said people outside
began throwing stones when they heard a shot fired inside the prison
to quiet unruly detainees and troops moved in to quell the
disturbance.

   Prime Minister Charles Haughey conceded
today he had not won a majority in parliament in the Irish general
election but said he would attempt to form a government.
   ``I didn't get the answer I wanted,'' Haughey said.
   With more than 90 percent of the seats decided after Thursday's
election, it was clear that Haughey would have to govern with fewer
friendly faces. The results prompted talk of a historic realignment
of Irish politics.
   ``One of the disappointing things is that Irish politics may now
become polarized between right and left,'' said Progressive
Democrats leader Desmond O'Malley.
   Nonetheless, Haughey said he had no intention of resigning as
leader of the Fianna Fail Party, the country's largest.
   ``We will form a government,'' he said. ``We will do our
political best to provide the people with a government.''
   National election returns early today showed a surge of the Irish
left, with the Labor Party and the Workers Party gaining seats, and
the Green Party getting into Ireland's parliament, called the Dail,
for the first time.
   The state television network RTE projected that Fianna Fail would
win 77 or 78 seats, a loss of two or three.
   With 151 of 165 races decided, Fianna Fail had won 70 seats, Fine
Gael 47, Labor Party 15, Progressive Democrats 6, Workers Party 7,
Democratic Socialist 1, Green Party 1, independent and others 4.
Recounts were under way in six constituencies.
   It was a sharp setback for Haughey, who called the vote hoping to
gain his first majority in five elections. During his previous four
terms, he governed with support from other parties.
   ``It's quite clear that you can't impose stringent financial
policies which are unpopular and expect people to give you the sort
of majority we were looking for,'' he said in an RTE interview.
   Haughey had steeply reduced Ireland's budget deficit but at a
cost of sharp cuts in social services. He admitted during the
campaign he was surprised at the ferocity of resentment especially
against health service cuts.
   Asked why he had called the election, Haughey said ``it was a
political judgment'' that his support in parliament from the
opposition Fine Gael Party ``wasn't going to last any longer, and I
was anxious to get a working majority so that I could go ahead and
implement our very comprehensive national development plan.''
   Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes derided Haughey as a ``five-time
loser.''
   Though he had predicted earlier in the week that his party would
win the election, Dukes said today he was ``very happy'' with his
modest gains.
   Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) and Fine Fael (Family of the
Irish) are both conservative economically, but Fine Gael tends to be
more liberal on social issues. The Progressive Democrats are
breakaways from Fianna Fail.
   The left, meanwhile, exulted in its victories.
   ``This is the best day we (the left) have had in the history of
the state,'' said Jim Kemmy, a surprise winner in east Limerick. He
will be the only Democratic Socialist in the Dail.
   ``We're talking about the left breaking the mold,'' said Paty
Rabbittee, a winner for the Workers Party in southwest Dublin.
   James Downey, editor of The New Nation magazine, said Haughey's
party, Fianna Fail, had itself to blame for the leftist surge.
   ``Fianna Fail ... did something that they have never ever done
before. They made a choice between middle-class and working-class
vote, and they got the middle-class vote,'' Downey said Friday night.
   Haughey's program of fiscal austerity won approval from the
middle class, but cuts in health services apparently hurt its
support among the working class.
   Gerry O'Sullivan of the Labor Party, who won in north-central
Cork, said a hospital closing was a factor in his victory.
   Despite the disappointment for Haughey, the next term would still
mark the first time he has served twice in a row. He was beaten
after all his other terms.
   Fianna Fail claims the mantle of forces that originally opposed
the partition of Ireland in 1921. Its nationalism has kept it in
power for most of the republic's 68-year history.

   A United Mine Workers wildcat strike
that grew during the week to include more than 20,000 miners in six
states shows no sign of ending, UMW officials say.
   ``We're having trouble keeping them in the mines,'' said Roger
Myers, international executive board member for UMW District 11 in
Indiana.
   On Friday, the wildcat walkout idled 2,500 miners in
Pennsylvania, 1,390 in Indiana, 790 in Virginia, 295 in Kentucky,
200 in Tennessee and about two-thirds of West Virginia's 24,000
miners, company officials said.
   At AMAX Coal Co.'s Ayrshire Mine at Chandler, Ind., UMW Local
1907 President Greg Young said after a union meeting Friday that
workers will continue to strike, although he told them the UMW
constitution and contract require them to return to work.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton said he ``is continuing every
day in a quiet, behind-the-scenes way talking to both sides to see
what we can do in state government to bring this to an end.''
   The walkout began Monday in southern West Virginia in sympathy
with about 1,600 UMW members on strike against the Pittston Coal
Group in West Virginia and Virginia.
   The original strike by West Virginia and Virginia miners began in
April when Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association to negotiate with the union independently. The two sides
have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
   In Pennsylvania, District 2 President Nick Molnar said union
officials planned to tell each of the 52 local unions that their
members should report to work as usual. Molnar said he could not
predict whether the miners would obey.
   Molnar was among union leaders who led a Friday morning rally by
about 5,000 miners in Ebensburg, Pa., near Johnstown.
   Molnar said the miners supported striking Pittston workers and
criticized the court system which, he said, is ``practicing economic
terrorism against the mine workers' organization.''
   In Hazleton, Pa., meanwhile, District 25 officials are organizing
miners who could leave on short notice from UMW President Richard
Trumka to picket in support of the Pittston strikers, said Bill Ray,
District 25 president and an acting member of the union's
international executive board.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge William Kidd in Clarksburg issued
back-to-work orders for seven Consolidation Coal Co. mines in
northern West Virginia. Striking miners have ignored similar orders
in southern West Virginia all week.
   The strikers Friday included about 1,600 miners who failed to
report for work at Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in
central Pennsylvania, company spokesman Hank Waneck said.
   ``We are being penalized for a labor problem in another area. It
appears that the United Mine Workers are returning to the era of
instability of the 1970s, which contributed to the decline of UMW
mined coal from 70 percent to less than 35 percent of the nation's
production today,'' Waneck said.

   A court today sentenced eight people to death for
beating soldiers and setting fire to vehicles during the military's
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   The seven men and one woman were the first people condemned to
die in Beijing for resisting the military in its drive on June 3-4
to sweep pro-democracy students from Tiananmen Square.
   Earlier this week, three Shanghai men also received the death
sentence for leading anti-government riots in that city.
   Also today, more than 100 Chinese accused of joining the protests
surrendered, four Western journalists who were expelled by the
government left China, and the government tried to attract foreign
investors back to China.
   Government-run television reported that the eight were sentenced
to death by the Beijing Intermediate Court for setting fire to
public buses and army trucks and beating several soldiers.
   Estimates differ on how many died in the Beijing crackdown. The
government variously says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers, were
killed. Unofficial Chinese and Western intelligence reports say
troops fired on unarmed crowds and killed up to 3,000.
   Beijing radio said 109 people in the capital had turned
themselves in since the government started rounding up pro-democracy
leaders. The radio also said 16 people gave themselves up in
Nanjing, one of the many Chinese cities where protests broke out
after the military sweep in Beijing.
   Authorities have arrested more than 1,200 people nationwide the
last two weeks, including several student leaders.
   Two American journalists left China today under government
expulsion orders for their reporting on the protests.
   John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the U.S.
government-funded Voice of America were followed by plainclothes
police with video cameras as they said goodbye to colleagues at the
Beijing airport before boarding a plane for Hong Kong.
   The two, accused of violating martial law regulations barring
reporters from talking to student leaders, were the first
Beijing-based foreign correspondents expelled during the current
political upheaval.
   Two reporters for the London-based Independent Television News
also left China today for Hong Kong after being ordered out for
reporting on unrest in the southwestern city of Chengdu without
proper press accreditation. They were in China on tourist visas.
   The government, meanwhile, intensified its campaign to woo
foreign investment back to China.
   China's top trade official criticized foreign countries for
halting loans and aid to protest the government's suppression of
dissent and told foreign governments to ``return to the road of
cooperation with China.''
   Zheng Tuobin, minister of foreign economic relations and trade,
said some nations were taking economic measures against China to
``put pressure on China and interfere with Chinese internal
affairs,'' Beijing radio reported today.
   He did not single out any countries for criticism. Earlier,
however, China rebuked the United States for banning military sales
and contracts in the wake of the military assault in Beijing.
   Some other countries have taken similar action. France has frozen
relations with China, and Japan has put off new development
assistance loans.
   Thousands of foreign businessmen have fled China. Some are now
trickling back, although the U.S. and Japanese governments still
advise their citizens to keep away from China because of the turmoil.
   In an interview broadcast today on Chinese television, government
spokesman Yuan Mu invited foreign businessmen to return, saying: ``I
am sure those people who left hastily will regret it one day, but it
is not too late to come back.'' Since China opened to the outside
world a decade ago, businesses from Japan, Hong Kong, the United
States and other countries have invested about $12 billion in
Chinese industries and set up nearly 10,000 joint ventures.
   In a sign the government will soon announce a new crop of
hard-line rulers, Yuan said ``certain individuals'' in China's
leadership were ``guilty of supporting counterrevolutionary
turmoil.''
   ``But their questions will be dealt with soon and will be made
public,'' he said in the NBC-TV interview broadcast today on Chinese
television.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee is expected to meet soon
to oust party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, a leading moderate. He
is believed to have been stripped of power after opposing the
decision by senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng to
declare martial law in Beijing on May 20.

<HEAD>Amendment Gives Slovenia Right to Secede From Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slovenia's Parliament has adopted a
constitutional amendment granting this nation's most developed
republic the right to secede, news reports said today.
   The amendment, which was passed on Friday, states that the
Slovenian people have ``the lasting and inalienable right to
self-determination, including the right to secession and
association,'' the official Tanjug news agency said.
   It was unlikely, however, that federal authorities in Belgrade
would allow the northern republic to break away from the union.
   Yugoslavia, a loose federaration of six republics and two
provinces containing various nationalities and religions, is passing
through its worst economic and political crisis. Annual inflation
exceeds 600 percent, and there has been an alarming increase in
social and ethnic tension.
   The republic of Slovenia, whose leadership advocates regional
autonomy, greater democracy and closer ties with the West, has long
been at odds with the southern republic of Serbia, where officials
favor greater central control and a stronger federal government.
Slovenia's Communist Party leadership is considered the most liberal
in Yugoslavia.
   The clash between the two republics, characterized by official
media as a propaganda campaign between two countries at war, has
generated Serbian and Slovenian nationalist feelings.
   In an unusually blunt interview published Friday, Slovenia's
Communist Party chief Milan Kucan said relations between the
republics are ``frozen.''
   ``We have to decide if we want to continue living together or
not,'' Kucan was quoted as saying. He said co-existence should not
be ``at any cost.''
   Slavko Goldstein, president of the Croatian Social-Liberal Union,
an independent group, has said the ruling Communist Party cannot
solve Yugoslavia's crisis. Only an agreement among ``non-communist
forces'' can prevent the country from falling apart, he said.
   Yugoslavia's Communist leadership is split between ``two
irreconcilable political concepts'' _ Slovenian and Serbian _ which
could cause a civil war, similar to that in Lebanon, he said.
   Kosovo, a province of Serbia, has been torn by ethnic strife.
   In March, 25 people were killed when ethnic Albanians rioted to
protest constitutional changes giving Serbia more control over the
province. In Kosovo, 85 percent of the 1.8 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians.

   Two U.S. journalists expelled from China arrived
in Hong Kong today, and one said the government ousted them because
it did not want Chinese to learn the truth about the military
suppression of protesters.
   Plainclothes police in Beijing used video cameras to film the
journalists, John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of
the U.S.-funded Voice of America, as they departed.
   Chinese authorities on Wednesday accused them of martial law
violations and gave them 72 hours to leave China.
   They were the first Beijing-based reporters expelled after the
military's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Two British television reporters traveling on temporary visas
also were ordered out of China and arrived in Hong Kong today.
   ``I'm sad to be leaving,'' Pomfret told reporters before leaving
Beijing this afternoon. ``It's a great country. I hope I can come
back some day.''
   The pair arrived in Hong Kong without incident three hours later.
   Pessin said upon arriving that ``everything the Chinese
government said about Voice Of America is wrong.'' The government
accused the VOA of spreading rumors and instigating turmoil.
   ``I think they sent us out because they don't want the world, and
most particularly they don't want the Chinese people, to know the
truth about what's been happening in China, especially what happened
two weeks ago,'' Pessin said. Journalists Vernon Mann and John
Elphinstone of the Independent Television News of Britain also
arrived in Hong Kong today. The two, traveling on tourist visas,
were detained Wednesday while filming unrest in the Sichuan capital,
Chengdu, then expelled. A correspondent of the same news
organization, Peter Newport, was expelled from Shanghai on June 10.
   Martial law orders issued for Beijing on May 20 banned foreign
reporters from interviewing student leaders of pro-democracy
demonstrations and from taking photographs of troops or covering
events around Tiananmen Square, where protesters had gathered for
several weeks.
   Journalists generally have ignored the regulations.
   Estimates differ on how many died in the Beijing crackdown.
   The government variously says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers,
were killed. Unofficial Chinese and Western intelligence reports say
troops fired on unarmed crowds and killed up to 3,000.
   As Pomfret bid farewell to colleagues and friends at the Beijing
airport today, police with portable video cameras followed. Two
others filmed from an airport balcony but ducked out of sight when
crews from Western television networks aimed cameras at them.
   The Chinese media renewed their attacks on Pessin today.
   Official Beijing television broadcast a commentary accusing
Pessin and the Voice of America of ``rumor-mongering.''
   The Voice of America, which broadcasts in Chinese, is a major
source of information for millions of Chinese trying to go beyond
what is reported in the tightly controlled domestic press.
   Pessin told friends he had been harassed after his expulsion was
ordered. He said he received an obscene telephone call from a man
with a Chinese accent and several telexes that said: ``Yankee go
home.''
   His wife, Audrey, said Chinese men with a video camera followed
her from the airport Thursday after she returned to Beijing on a
flight from Bangkok.
   Pomfret said a car followed him Friday night as he returned to
his residence in a foreign diplomatic compound after a party for him
and Pessin.
   Elphinstone said in Hong Kong taht police officers in Chengdu put
him and Mann through a ``self-criticism'' session before they were
expelled.

   Three Protestants and a Roman
Catholic were seriously injured in sectarian attacks today, police
said.
   In another incident, police discovered 300 pounds of explosives
in a car that tried to evade a police checkpoint near Belfast's
mainly Catholic Ardoyne area. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said
police believe they foiled a major bombing somewhere in the city.
   Also today, a bomb exploded just outside Belfast on the main line
to Dublin line, police said. Rail authorities said the main line
between Belfast and Lisburn was expected to be closed most of today
while security forces inspected damage. No one was injured, police
said.
   The Dublin-Belfast line has been closed 17 times this year
because of attacks by the outlawed Irish Republican Army and other
bomb alerts.
   In two sectarian attacks on Protestants in Belfast, police said
one man was shot in the stomach by men who forced their way into his
home, and two others sleeping by a bonfire were savagely beaten with
hatchets.
   In Antrim, police said, a 29-year-old Catholic man was attacked
with broken pieces of concrete and the top of some of his fingers
were hacked off.
   Police said all four victims were hospitalized in serious
condition. Three men from mainly Catholic west Belfast were arrested
in connection with the shooting attack, police said.
   In Belfast's Ardoyne area, police said they were questioning a
man after the bomb was found in a car which tried to evade a police
checkpoint. The army defused the device, which police said was
primed and ready for use.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Mexican Government Recovers More Stolen Treasure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has recovered more gold, jade
and stone artifacts that were stolen from the National Museum of
Archaeology in a daring Christmas Day robbery in 1985, an official
said.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said one of the 19
pieces of jewelry found Friday was among the most important of all
the stolen items.
   Authorities recovered 111 items last weekend. On Wednesday
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari presided over a ceremony
returning them to the museum.
   The artifacts date from 500 B.C. to 2500 B.C. and include masks
and jewelry from Mexico's ancient Aztec, Mixteca, Maya and Zapotec
civilizations. About 25 items still are missing.
   Federal agents in Mexico City followed one man, Carlos Perches
Trevino, 24, for 45 days before his arrest on June 9, Alvarez said
earlier this week. He said officials were seeking another man,
identified as Ramon Sardina Garcia.
   Sardina left a box of tools at the home of a friend, Maria
Antonieta Ponce Mercado, who became suspicious after learning of the
man's alleged involvement in the museum robbery and told her uncle,
Alvarez said. The uncle contacted the attorney general's office on
Friday.
   Alvarez said federal agents and museum officials went to Ms.
Ponce's house in a Mexico City suburb and found 19 pieces of jewelry
in the box.
   ``Among what we found was one of the five most important missing
pieces, a figure of a Mayan governor,'' he said Friday night.
   Alvarez said earlier this week that Perches and Sardina had
staked out the museum for six months. The pair then jumped the
fence, crawled in through an air conditioning duct and looted seven
display cases, he said.
   The attorney general said the men kept the artifacts for more
than a year, then exchanged some for drugs.

   A National Guard helicopter flying in
dense fog crashed in a residential area on Cape Cod early today,
killing the six men aboard, after narrowly missing several houses,
authorities said.
   Rescue workers recovered the six bodies, using heavy equipment to
lift the UH-1 Bell helicopter and remove one of the victims pinned
underneath.
   There were no surviving crewmen and no injuries on the ground,
Fire Department Deputy William Greene said. Earlier, he had said
there were fears that more than six bodies would be found in the
wreckage.
   The helicopter was from a Delaware Army National Guard unit based
in New Castle, Del., guard spokeswoman Terry Blevins said from
Delaware. She said the regiment is attending training camp at Camp
Edwards, about 30 miles from the crash site.
   Camp Edwards is part of the Otis Air Force Base complex. A person
answering the telephone at the base this morning said the base
spokewoman was not immediately available.
   Ms. Blevins said three of the victims were from Delaware. Two of
them were identified as 1st Lt. David Joseph Hendry of Wilmington,
Del., and Staff Sgt. Benjamin Robert Greenplate, of Newark, Del. The
name of the third Delaware soldier and the other three victims were
not immediately released.
   The chopper crashed shortly after midnight in a residential
neighborhood, missing one home by just 100 feet, Greene said.
Wreckage was scattered in a 150-foot radius from the crash site.
   Police said there was no damage to homes as the helicopter cut a
20-foot-wide swath through the woods, strewing doors, glass and
other debris.
   Neighbors said the aircraft came close enough to make their
houses vibrate.
   ``We said, `This guy's going to crash,' and a couple of seconds
later he did,'' said John Palino.
   ``It was like a crumpled piece of paper,'' Palino said of the
helicopter. ``We didn't want to get near it because we were afraid
it would explode.''
   At least one resident reported hearing what sounded like engine
trouble just before the aircraft crashed. ``You could hear the
blades stopping and (then) like a thump,'' Bill O'Connor said.
   A team of military investigators reached the scene about 5:30
a.m. The cause of the crash was not immediately known, said Richard
Bunker, a state aeronautical inspector.
   Officials said one or more helicopters had been flying over
Yarmouth for much of the evening. Yarmouth is about 85 miles south
of Boston.
   ``We received several telephone calls from people in the area,''
police Sgt. Paul J. Rooney said. ``They heard a helicopter flying
low overhead and then heard the crash.''
   He said the crash was confirmed by residents about 12:10 a.m.

<TEXT>
   A 21-gun salute is par for the course
at the Kabul Golf and Country Club. Or, to be precise, a barrage
from the rocket launcher fired by Afghan troops in the hills near
the dusty, nine-hole course.
   ``It's great fun to play here,'' an Asian diplomat said. ``Where
else on earth do you play and pick up your own trophies?'' he added,
pointing to a pile of metal shell casings he had collected walking
from one hole to the next.
   President Najib's government, in an attempt to show that things
are getting better in battle-scarred Afghanistan, has reopened the
course and surrounding Kargha Lake area to civilians. Government
soldiers guard the golfers, mostly Asian diplomats and Asians and
Europeans working for U.N. agencies.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas, who have been fighting since 1978 to
oust Kabul's Soviet-backed government, are only a few miles away in
the Paghman Mountains on the other side of the lake.
   Between greens, which are actually ``browns'' made of gravel, the
golfers gauge the war as well as their backswings.
   Just as they were ready to tee off Friday, their weekly day away
from work, there was a barrage of rocket fire from the government
outpost on a nearby hill.
   ``From the sound, it looks like they are using the BM-21s
today,'' the Asian diplomat said. ``Today there seems to be more
than average activity from the government side.''
   As the six golfers reached the seventh hole, there were two loud
sounds followed by billows of smoke and dust in the hills.
   ``Judging from this side's (the government's) action today, the
other side is in real trouble,'' said an Asian health official
working for the United Nations. Like the others, he asked to remain
anonymous.
   ``The fact that we are able to play golf in Kabul proves that
things are certainly getting better,'' the health official said.
``Except for the noise the missiles and rockets creates, which does
affect our game, we have no other problem.''
   But the young Afghan caddies whisper to visitors to be careful.
Sometimes new sand traps appear from week to week: bunkers dug in
the course by government soldiers.
   The 30-year-old golf course 10 miles northwest of Kabul was set
up to cater to the foreign community and once drew dozens of
golfers, mostly U.S. and Western European diplomats and U.N.
staffers. But the Americans and their allies closed their embassies
last winter, citing fears of a blood bath when the Soviet army
withdrew the last of its combat troops in February.
   So far the guerrillas have not come over the mountains to fight a
face-to-face war with the government troops, who are still supplied
by the Soviet Union. But during the winter, they stepped up their
activity around Kargha Lake, and the government declared the area
off-limits to civilians.
   ``There was a time when we used to refuse membership, but now we
want more people to join us,'' the Asian health official said.
   A decade ago, before the Soviet army arrived to back the Afghan
government in the civil war, the golf club had 45 members.
   Now only four to six golfers make the rounds on Fridays, the
weekly Islamic holy day, a non-working day for Afghans and
foreigners alike in Kabul.
   After the game, the golfers sit on the banks of a narrow stream
running beside the course. Their clubhouse has been taken over by
the Afghan army, but the golfers don't appear to mind.
   ``Here, try to put the ball in that hole,'' a West European
official from the U.N. said, handing his club to a soldier.
   The young soldier swung the club and the ball flew past the
green. His comrades laughed.
   Another stepped forward, took aim and swung. The ball came within
inches of the hole.
   ``Many of them have been watching us for months, and I am sure
some of them could be good golfers, if trained,'' the European said.
``But they have a battle to fight. But maybe one day we can have a
go with some of them.
   ``I mean in golf.''

   An East German jetliner carrying 113 people veered
into a field and caught fire today while trying to take off in East
Berlin, killing at least five people and injuring 39, the East
German state news agency said.
   The death count was likely to climb as rescue workers searched
for more bodies in the charred wreckage of the plane, the agency,
ADN, said.
   It said 13 of the injured were hurt seriously and that about 50
people escaped without injury. That would leave about 19 people
missing. ``It must be assumed there are more passengers in the
rubble who have died,'' ADN said.
   Passengers aboard the Moscow-bound Ilyushin-62 aircraft scrambled
out of emergency exits to escape the burning plane, the news agency
said.
   According to ADN, the aircraft started its takeoff at 8:29 a.m.,
taxiing about 500 yards down the runway at Schoenefeld airfield. For
some unknown reason, it then careened into a field and caught fire,
ADN said.
   It said the Soviet-built jetliner, carrying 103 passengers and 10
crew, was owned by Interflug, the state-owned East German airline.
It said the plane was ``fully fueled.''
   Diethart Guenther, a safety expert with Interflug, said the
airplane was ``torn apart and completely burned out'' in the
accident, ADN said.
   It took firemen about an hour to douse the blaze, it said.
   ADN said the passengers who escaped were lucky because one wing
of the four-engine jet remained intact and did not burn.
   The last serious aircraft accident at Schoenefeld airport
occurred on Dec. 12, 1986, when an Aeroflot Tupolev 134 crashed into
the woods as it was approaching for a landing, killing 80 people.
   Investigators later said the cause of the accident was a
misunderstanding between the pilot and airport control tower.

<HEAD>Italy Imports Politicians As It Moves Toward Unified Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy is taking the idea of the European Common
Market a step further than importing butter, hair dryers and
chocolates. It is importing politicians.
   In a move unprecedented in Europe, Italy has allowed citizens
from all 12 Common Market countries to run on Italian tickets in
Sunday's European Parliament election.
   In addition to the usual offering of political leaders, Italians
have the choice of an Irish nationalist, an exiled Soviet dissident
or a leader of France's 1968 student rebellion. One party even tried
to enlist Salman Rushdie, author of the controversial novel ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   The candidates are barnstorming Italy, campaigning in French,
German, Spanish and English in a sometimes bewildering glimpse of
what life could be like in a unified Europe, where people, goods and
services would move freely between the countries.
   The new Europe is to be realized by 1992 under an EEC plan
adopted in 1987.
   ``I'd like to know Italian well enough to speak it,'' Briton
David Steel told a recent Rome campaign rally, speaking Italian with
a thick Scottish accent. ``But unfortunately, I'm not able to.
Therefore I'll switch to English,'' the Social and Liberal Democrat
said.
   Asked if they wanted a translator, the crowd cried, ``No!''
However, they looked blank as Steel joked and harangued _ until the
translator gave it to them in Italian.
   Italians are strong supporters of European unity and have one of
the highest national voting rates for the European Parliament _ 83
percent in 1984. A similar percentage of the 47 million eligible
voters is expected to turn out this time to choose Italy's 81
representatives on the 518-member body, comprised of elected members
from each EEC nation.
   ``Italians do not have a very high opinion of their own
government,'' said Ottavio Lavaggi, an Italian member of the Liberal
group in the European Parliament, which has little day-to-day power.
``If tomorrow there is a united Europe, it can't be governed worse
than the Italian government is now. That's one of the origins of
sympathy for this idea of foreigners.''
   Putting symbolic figures or famous entertainers on party tickets
is a time-honored practice in Italy, where porn star Ilona
``Cicciolina'' Staller sits in Parliament and European Parliament
representatives have included a TV host who ran while under arrest
on charges of Mafia collaboration.
   The candidates, nicknamed ``blood donors'' for their political
contributions, are intended to draw votes or prove a point.
   The enlisting of foreign candidates is all that and more.
   ``It is a component in a certain way linked to the strong
`foreign-mania' present in Italy,'' said Arturo Parisi, a professor
of political sociology at the University of Bologna.
   ``Good or bad, this is a residual of the defeat of the fascist
nationalism'' of dictator Benito Mussolini, he said in a telephone
interview.
   He explained that many people were ashamed of the fascist rule
and by its propaganda glorifying Italy. Voters rejected
nationalistic themes and were attracted to non-Italian images such
as Europeanism, he said.
   Among the imported personalities running is Daniel Cohn-Bendit,
known as ``Danny the Red'' for leading the 1968 French student
uprising. He is running on the Greens ticket.
   Italy's Social Democrats are running Leonid Plyushch, a Soviet
dissident living in France.
   Other foreigners include Kalman Domotor de Szeodemeter, a
Hungarian anti-communist exile living in France, who is running for
the neo-fascist Italian Socialist Movement, and Danny Morrison, a
member of Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein, the political arm of the
Irish Republican Army. He is running for Italy's far-left
Proletarian Democracy party.
   Most tickets still are led by traditional Italian politicians.
The foreigners are not expected to significantly affect the balance
of the Italian vote, which will likely give the dominant Christian
Democrats the top position, as they have domestically.
   Despite the presence of the foreigners, the campaign has focused
on domestic rather than European politics. The campaign comes in the
wake of the collapse of Italy's 48th government, and parties are
hoping to show strength to improve their position in negotiations
for a new government.
   Lavaggi says the election of Steel, who is running on the
combined Liberal-Republican-Radical ticket, would be a ``symbolic
gesture'' supporting the parties' interest in a more unified Europe.
   But he says the nationality of the candidates is not an issue.
   ``If you think in the perspective of a united Europe, he (Steel)
is a European citizen born in the United Kingdom ... It doesn't
raise any problems,'' he said.

   When Charles ``Chuck'' Simmons took over as
police chief in this Atlanta suburb last year, the first thing he
did was get rid of the traditional six-shot, .38-caliber revolver.
   ``We've just finished our transition to the 9mm Glock
semiautomatic pistol, which can carry up to 20 rounds,'' Simmons
said. ``Now, we're looking at replacing our shotguns with 9mm
carbines.''
   Simmons isn't alone in beefing up his arsenal. More and more
police departments, big and small, are switching to semiautomatic or
fully automatic weapons. Most of the new weapons fire 9mm bullets,
which are slightly smaller than .38-caliber rounds. But
semiautomatics use clips that hold many more bullets than
traditional police arms.
   Simmons said clip-fed pistols and rifles give the police three
things they badly need to combat today's heavily armed criminals:
more firepower, quicker reloading and greater accuracy over longer
distances.
   Simmons came to Marietta from Palm Bay, Fla., where, he says, his
officers ``were outgunned'' in a 1987 shootout at two shopping
centers with a man carrying a semiautomatic rifle with a 30-round
clip.
   ``Two police officers were among the six people killed,'' he
said. ``It appeared one of our officers was fatally wounded while
trying to reload his empty revolver.''
   Simmons, who said Palm Bay was switching to semiautomatic pistols
at the time of the shootout, now has re-armed three departments in
seven years.
   ``I'm either a leader in the field or a jerk, depending upon your
point of view,'' he said.
   The trend goes against other efforts to ban high-firepower
weapons, such as California's recent law against civilian possession
of the AK-47 assault rifle, and it troubles some law enforcement
officials.
   ``It's true the police are facing ever more dangerous weapons,''
said Hubert Williams, director of the Police Foundation, a law
enforcement think tank in Washington. ``However, the police are part
of the civilian population in this country and, to the degree we
increase the type of arms they bear, they become, to that same
degree, a more military-type police force.''
   Simmons feels much the same.
   ``Ideally, we shouldn't need these new weapons,'' he said. ``But
there are so many semiautomatics on the street these days it would
take years to get rid of them, even if we banned them tomorrow.
Meanwhile, we simply can't afford to let ourselves be outgunned when
the shooting starts.''
   Police SWAT teams have used powerful weapons for years, but it's
the cop on the beat who is getting the new 9mm pistols with names
like Glock, Beretta, Ruger, Sig Sauer and Taurus.
   ``These new `nines' with the funny names are where it's at right
now,'' said Dewey Stokes, president of the 198,000-member Fraternal
Order of Police.
   ``We know that many, many of our members have switched over to
`nines,' but we don't know just how many,'' he said. ``We're polling
them in an effort to find out.''
   The National Sheriffs Association is conducting a similar poll of
the nation's 29,000 sheriffs and deputies.
   ``We feel that the wheel gun, or revolver, just isn't adequate
anymore,'' said Bud Meeks, director of the sheriffs association.
   Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Miami, Boston, Atlanta and
Columbus, Ohio, are among big city police departments converting to
semiautomatic pistols, and Chicago is studying the idea.
   New York decided to stick with six-shot revolvers, but several of
its suburbs have switched.
   ``The movement definitely isn't confined to big cities,'' said
Cheryl Epps of the International Association of Police Chiefs.
   ``While D.C. is going to 9mm, for example, Prince William County,
Virginia, further up the road, also is armed to the teeth with fully
automatic weapons. They're everywhere now,'' she said.
   In Winnetka, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, Police Chief Herbert Timm
created a stir when he proposed putting Uzi machine guns in squad
cars.
   Simmons, here in Marietta, said he also has considered machine
guns.
   ``We feel the shotgun is outdated as a street weapon, given what
we're coming up against,'' he said. ``Just a few days ago, for
example, we answered a routine trouble call and wound up
confiscating an AR-15, the commercial variety of the M-16
semiautomatic rifle.''
   Sgt. Jack Schmida, firearms expert with the Los Angeles Police
Department, said an LAPD officer was killed last year by a gunman
with an AR-15.
   ``The drug dealers usually shoot each other with these weapons,
but they do shoot at us from time to time,'' said Schmida, whose
department will begin Monday to slowly phase in 9mm Berettas by
issuing them to new recruits.
   In Columbus, Ohio, police officers are given a choice.
   ``Our officers can carry a 16-shot, 9mm semiautomatic or a
nine-shot, clip-loaded .45-caliber pistol,'' said Dewey Stokes, a
member of the 1,300-member force.
   ``With the .38s the officer carried a total of 18 rounds,
counting the 12 in his belt and six in the revolver,'' Stokes said.
``Now, with the `nines,' they will carry 48 rounds, and that's a
heckuva difference.''
   In Houston, officers are armed with a variety of pistols.
   ``They buy their own weapon and can carry practically anything
they want,'' said firearms instructor J.W. Walston. ``As a result,
our officers carry a multitude of calibers, everything from 9mm to
.44 Magnums to .45s. However, we do encourage them to not carry
.38s, and we suggest they use hollow point rounds.''
   Many urban police departments have begun using hollow point
bullets, a soft-nosed round that has greater stopping power. It
tends to spread out and produce more wallop from increased tissue
damage.
   Some financially strapped cities can't make make across-the-board
purchases of semiautomatic pistols, which cost from $350 to $550.
But they frequently permit officers to buy their own sidearms.
   That is the case in Stockton, Calif., where a gunman armed with
an AK-47 rifle opened fire on a schoolyard in January, killing five
children and wounding 29 students and a teacher.
   Sgt. Ed Williams, a 24-year veteran of the Stockton force, said
he made the switch and became a big fan of the 9mm pistol.
   ``I'm not a gun nut,'' he said. ``In fact, I wouldn't mind going
to the English method of unarmed police officers, but the switch
from a .38 to a 9mm has greatly improved my accuracy and
confidence.''
   Officers in Walla Walla, Wash., Huntington, W.Va., and Muskogee,
Okla., also may buy their own semiautomatic pistols. In Muskogee,
three-fourths of the 75 officers have switched to 9mm, police Maj.
Rex Eskridge said.
   Like many towns in Florida, where drug trafficking is
particularly heavy, Palm Bay has come to see 9mm weapons as a
necessity.
   ``In addition to the 9mm sidearms, we also provide our officers
with 9mm rifles,'' said Frank McBee, the department's firing range
officer. ``Right now, we're getting five to 10 requests a week from
other law enforcement agencies for information about the rifles. The
requests have come from all around the country; even the FBI has
requested information about them.''

   Public wrath over a savings and loan bailout
that will cost every man, woman and child in the United States an
estimated $633 is severely diluting the influence of the
once-powerful industry lobby.
   The House on Thursday approved President Bush's $157 billion
bailout package for the foundering savings and loan industry.
   In so doing, it resoundingly defeated industry-backed efforts to
weaken the cornerstone of reform contained in the measure, despite
the best efforts of S&amp;L lobbyists.
   ``The anger and outrage that seems to be welling up in America
canceled out the special pleadings of the S&amp;L industry,'' said Bert
Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial analyst.
   The industry's largest trade group, the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, until recently had a reputation for effectiveness
rivaling such not-to-be-crossed groups as the National Rifle
Association and the American Association of Retired Persons. That
appears to have changed.
   ``Clearly the tide has turned,'' said economist Robert Litan of
the Brookings Institution, a public policy research group. ``They're
on the run.''
   Before House passage of the S&amp;L bill, the league and independent
S&amp;L lobbyists pulled out all stops to preserve an accounting break
known as supervisory good will. It relieves about a fourth of the
industry from rules requiring S&amp;L owners to risk their own capital
ahead of depositors' money.
   The industry distributed buttons, bought full-page newspaper
advertisements and sent S&amp;L executives roaming the halls of Congress
to buttonhole hometown congressmen.
   It was all to no avail. The House rebuffed the industry by a
suprisingly lopsided 326-94 vote after Bush threatened to veto the
bill if it included a weakening amendment offered by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill.
   ``A populist wind was sweeping across the House,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking Committee and
one of the most vocal advocates of tough S&amp;L standards. ``... I
think the S&amp;L industry will never be the powerful force it once
was.''
   Publicly, the administration is crediting bipartisan
congressional leadership for the vote while also passing word that
Bush's last-minute pressure was what actually sealed the S&amp;L lobby's
fate.
   ``Unquestionably the biggest factor was the president's
determination and leadership and his willingness to draw a line in
the sand,'' said an official who asked not to be quoted by name.
   Schumer and other Democrats charge that Bush weighed in only
after it was clear he would be embarrassed by the spectacle of
Democrats overcoming Republican opposition to win a victory for the
president.
   ``We couldn't have done it alone,'' acknowledged Richard Breeden,
Bush's key adviser on S&amp;Ls. But, he added, ``What you've seen has
been active presidential leadership.''
   ``I think Congress has responded to it in the very finest
tradition of showing bipartisan spirit in solving major national
problems,'' he said.
   Democrats also would have faced image problems if they had voted
with the industry. Their House leaders, Jim Wright of Texas and Tony
Coelho of California, were driven from their posts in part by
allegations they granted special favors to the S&amp;L industry.
   ``I think the new Democratic leadership did not want to see a
headline written: `House Caves To S&amp;L Lobby.' ... That's probably
the key factor,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president
of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents
small banks.
   Even more than the Hyde amendment vote, the subsequent success of
a parliamentary maneuver, pressed by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, shows
how much the S&amp;L lobby has slipped.
   Leach wanted to delete more than a half dozen provisions,
benefiting large S&amp;Ls and some of the nation's most powerful
companies, including Citicorp, Merrill Lynch and Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co. But, he was denied the chance by the House Rules Committee.
   Shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday, with House members anxious to go
home after a 13-hour session, Leach used a parliamentary maneuver to
force a vote on removing special exceptions that had been inserted
by such senior banking committee members as Reps. Doug Barnard,
D-Ga., Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky. Leach won
411-8.
   A House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Banking Committee's phone lines were flooded after midnight Thursday
with calls from outraged lobbyists wanting to know how Leach could
have succeeded.
   ``It's amazing, absolutely amazing that that sort of (measure) to
strike out all the goodies passed almost unanimously,'' Guenther
said.
   Leach said he believes ``reform sentiment is growing in the
Congress'' and members were unwilling to ask their constituents to
pay for a bailout that included special exceptions.
   But Litan of the Brookings Institution said so many House members
had lost battles for hometown institutions that they weren't willing
to approve breaks for banking committee insiders.
   The reasoning, according to Schumer, was ``Why make seven or
eight exceptions when you're not making others.''
   The House bill, probably after the July 4 recess, goes to a
conference with the Senate, which passed its S&amp;L bill in April. S&amp;L
lobbyists, despite their defeat in the highly visible venue of the
House floor, will try again to wrest concessions in the less public
conference.
   ``This is seen as desperation time by the S&amp;Ls and they're going
to be working harder than ever on the conferees. I'd give 50-50 odds
that we're going to end up with something weaker than the House
bill,'' said Ely, the analyst in Alexandria, Va.
   ``We know that all kinds of strange and wonderous things happen
in conference. ... The two-week recess provides plenty of time for
an awful lot of stuff to be worked out,'' he said.

   A Portuguese air force helicopter crashed
and burned Saturday at the Atlantic beach resort of Figueira da Foz,
killing the craft's five occupants, an official said.
   The French-made Alouette III copter crashed while trying to land
on the beach in thick fog, an air force spokesman.
   The helicopter was carrying two air force officers and three
members of a television crew who were filming a documentary, an
official of the RTP state televison network said.
   All five were killed instantly, said Antonio Murta, fire chief of
Figueira da Foz, 120 miles north of Lisbon.
   The helicopter was about 50 yards above the sand when it suddenly
fell and burst into flames on impact, said Feliz Pinot, a witness.
   Another witness said people were on the sand when the copter
crashed. There were no reported injuries among those on the beach.
   The helicopter was from an air force base at Tancos.

   Toxic fumes seeped from an abandoned

   The two men were found dead near the well on Friday, according to
local police spokesman Lt. Col. Kusyudono. Fumes from the well also

   The well had been abandoned since 1976. It was not immediately

<HEAD>Supply Squeeze Foreseen, But no Return of Gas Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline supplies this summer are likely to be
the tightest in years, but motorists won't be idling in long lines
unless the distribution system is crimped by a refinery or pipeline
accident, analysts say.
   The supply squeeze may trigger more price increases as the summer
driving season wears on. Yet interviews with government, industry
and independent analysts indicate at least a modest possibility that
prices could drop a few cents a gallon.
   ``We'll not see a gasoline shortage,'' barring a major supply
accident, says John Lichtblau, executive director of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation in New York.
   He says refineries are running full blast to meet a growing
demand for gasoline, so the supply system is more vulnerable than
usual to accidental outages.
   ``If any refinery breaks down you could have some problems,''
Lichtblau says.
   The national average gasoline price slipped about a penny a
gallon between mid-May and early June, to $1.17, after a steep and
steady rise earlier in the spring, according to the Lundberg Survey,
a Los Angeles-based group that tracks gasoline prices through
surveys of 12,000 service stations nationwide.
   Overall, prices now are nearly 20 cents a gallon higher than at
the start of the year.
   The price outlook for summer is clouded by conflicting forces at
work in the market.
   More summertime driving would be expected to push up prices at
the pump, yet wholesale prices paid by service station dealers have
come down in recent weeks. It's not clear, however, that dealers
will pass on their savings to consumers, since they took a beating
in late March and April when wholesale prices skyrocketed in the
aftermath of the Exxon oil tanker spill in Alaska on March 24.
   ``Retailers have not gained back all that they lost'' in profit
margins, says Trilby Lundberg, head of the gasoline survey. So they
may not be ready to drop prices, she said.
   The big price jump following the oil spill, which only briefly
interrupted crude oil supplies to the West Coast, was one of the
steepest on record. It sparked accusations on Capitol Hill of price
gouging and possible collusion among the oil companies.
   The companies say they have simply passed on the higher prices
they are paying for crude oil. Lichtblau says crude accounts for
about half the cost of making gasoline.
   Edwin Rothschild, assistant director of the Citizen-Labor Energy
Coalition, says gasoline prices were bound to rise this spring
because of growing demand and a variety of factors that have
constrained gasoline production. But he contends the oil companies
used the Exxon spill as an excuse to push up prices to service
station dealers much faster than was justified.
   Rothschild says prices are likely to jump another nickel a gallon
this summer, but he rejects a forecast by Buyers Up, a
Washington-based consumer group, that motorists soon could find
themselves in gas lines reminiscent of the 1970s.
   ``That's ludicrous,'' says Rothschild. He and other analysts say
any further squeeze on supplies will push up prices, not force
stations to close pumps.
   Christopher Dyson, author of the Buyers Up report of June 13,
says one of the key reasons for expecting gas lines is that existing
stocks of gasoline _ and the availability of foreign supplies _ are
not enough to meet growing demand.
   ``We could see spot shortages in the form of gas lines by the
beginning of August,'' he says.
   Peter Beutel, an analyst with the New York investment firm of
Elders Futures, had predicted last April a 50 percent chance of gas
lines this summer. But he now says the chances have dropped to about
20 percent because the higher prices have attracted new supplies.
   Thomas Petrie, a partner in the Denver-based oil consulting firm
Petrie Parkman, says he cannot rule out the possibility of brief
shortages of gasoline this summer, even if there are no refinery
accidents or other big problems. He says any shortages would be
``very localized, not something that is national.''
   One of the main reasons for concern, in Petrie's view, is the
effect new environmental regulations are having on refinery
operations.
   The Environmental Protection Agency in March imposed new rules to
limit gasoline fumes during the summer months. The rules, called
Reid Vapor Pressure standards, are intended to cut emissions of
volatile hydrocarbons from gasoline. These hydrocarbons, such as
butane, form ozone, a major component of smog.
   To meet the standard, oil refiners have to change the mix of
their gasoline. This has added to refining costs and crimped output.
   ``It's causing a tight market,'' Petrie said.
   The Energy Department said in a report last month that the
environmental standards were affecting supplies, but it also cited
the effects of growing demand for gasoline. It predicted demand
would reach a 10-year high this summer.
   ``We do see a tight gasoline situation going into the summer,''
said Calvin Kilgore, director of the department's office of energy
markets and end use. He added, however, that it would be ``pushing
it a bit'' to say gas lines are likely.

<TEXT>
   Communist guerrillas said Saturday
that American servicemen in the Philippines are targets for attacks.
   The rebel New People's Army Central Luzon command made the
warning in a statement released to news agencies.
   Also Saturday, a newspaper reported that guerrillas had trailed
nine U.S. servicemen, apparently in preparation for an assassination
attempt.
   The rebels' policy ``of punishing American troops deployed in
U.S. military installations in the country'' is still in force, the
guerrilla statement said. It said about 1,000 Filipino soldiers
providing additional security around Clark Air Base also are targets.
   The Filipino troops were assigned to the U.S. base last year
following reports that guerrillas had trailed the nine U.S.
servicemen.
   The Pacific Stars and Stripes, an unofficial U.S. military
newspaper, quoted authorities as saying they learned of the
surveillance through documents seized in July from the New People's
Army.
   The newspaper quoted police Maj. Efren Alamares as saying the
nine _ two U.S. Air Force colonels, a lieutenant colonel, four
captains, and two sergeants _ were apparently targeted because they
lived off base.
   The U.S. military command at Clark refused comment on the rebel
statement. Capt. Donna Eggelston, a Clark spokeswoman, said the U.S.
Air Force ``periodically receives intelligence reports on terrorist
activity'' but does not comment on their content.
   Communist guerrillas have attacked Americans in the past.
   In April, guerrillas killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe as
he drove to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in
Quezon City.
   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino
civilian in coordinated ambushes outside Clark.
   The rebels have repeatedly threatened to attack U.S. personnel
because of Washington's support for President Corazon Aquino's
campaign to crush the guerrillas' 20-year insurgency.
   Some 40,000 American troops, civilians and military dependents
are stationed at six U.S. military installations in the Philippines.
More than half are stationed at Clark in central Luzon, the main
Philippine island.

<HEAD>Governors Back Bush in Call for Crackdown on Violent Crime</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans and Democrats alike, the nation's
governors generally support President Bush's call for tougher
sentences for violent criminals, limits on plea bargaining and the
death penalty.
   ``I applaud the president's federal initiatives and support his
concept of increasing the mandatory sentence for crimes involving
violence or drugs,'' said Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat.
   Bayh noted that Indiana has already added drug-related murders to
the state's capital punishment statute.
   In a speech Thursday to graduates of the Federal Law Enforcement
Training Academy in Glynco, Ga., Bush called on the nation's
governors to offer state-level support for three planks of his
anti-crime package.
   The president has proposed doubling to 10 years the mandatory
prison term for using semi-automatic weapons in violent crimes,
elimination of plea bargaining for federal firearms crimes and an
expanded death penalty.
   ``When a criminal commits a crime with a gun and someone dies,
justice demands something in return: the ultimate penalty, death,''
Bush said.
   ``I call on governors to match this federal initiative and
propose these same three standards at home: mandatory time, no deals
without cooperation and the death penalty,'' he said.
   Bush's proposed crime package that was formally submitted to
Congress last week includes a 5 percent bonus in federal law
enforcement grants for states that adopt model legislation providing
mandatory minimum sentences for firearms-related crimes.
   North Carolina's Republican governor, Jim Martin, said he favored
mandatory prison time for criminals who use guns in violent or
drug-related crimes. But mandatory sentences for these criminals
would put even more strain on the state's crowded prisons, he noted.
   ``The way we have to solve that is to build more prisons for
those who are involved in drug-related crimes so they can serve
their terms,'' he said.
   ``They won't be selling drugs to society if we can keep them
away,'' Martin said.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, a Republican who once served as
chief federal prosecutor in Chicago, echoed Martin's concern about
overcrowded prisons.'
   ``The failure to have a sufficient prison space compels
prosecutors and judges to give to lenient deals to criminals. That
encourages crime, not discourages it,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson said he supported Bush's call for an expanded death
penalty and added that the president's proposal in some ways
``mirrors the kind of program that we have seen in Illinois for the
last 13 years.''
   While plea bargaining is widely practiced, as it is in most
states, Illinois has mandatory prison sentences for a variety of
felonies, including murder, attempted murder, sexual asault, armed
robbery and serious drug trafficking.
   In a statement issued through a spokesman, Kentucky Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson, a Democrat, said he also supported the pillars of Bush's
program.
   ``Our message has to be clear: more time for violent crime, no
deal to drug deals, the ultimate penalty for the ultimate crime.''
   Kentucky, however, like most states, has no restrictions on plea
bargaining and there are no mandatory prison sentences.
   Limits on plea bargaining were not universally supported.
   While he favors the concept of limiting plea bargaining, Iowa
Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, says its not practical.
   ``You've got to give prosecutors some flexibility, Obviously
sometimes they plea bargain because they don't think they could get
a conviction on the higher offense.''
   Branstad also said he didn't ``believe the death penalty is a
panacea.''
   The governor said he favors the death penalty for some, but not
all cases. ``This may save some innocent victims from being
murdered,'' Branstad said of his support for the death penalty for
kidnapping and for killers of sex-abuse victims.
   Iowa does not have a death penalty statute and it is not likely
that capital punishment would be enacted while Democrats control the
legislature.
   In nearby Kansas, Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican, said Bush's
proposals ``dovetail with what we are doing at the state level,
especially in the area of drug trafficking.''
   While Kansas does not have a death penalty, the state has an
automatic life sentence for first-degree murder. The law bars parole
for at least 15 years. Kansas also imposes mandatory sentences for
felonies committed with firearms.
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican, meanwhile, is planning
to sign a bill that could result in the death penalty for defendants
convicted of drug-related murders.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who lost to Bush in a
presidential race last fall that featured GOP attacks on his state's
prison system, said the president's strategy is doomed to fail.
   ``All these things have been tried,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Unless we're serious about education and prevention and
treatment as well as effective enforcement... there's no sense in
reinventing the wheel.''

   An 11-year-old American hoping to
become the youngest person to fly around the world arrived here
Saturday and said he wanted to do some fishing before flying on to
Norway.
   Tony Aliengena and his family, from San Juan Capistrano in
Southern California, also planned to take part in festivities
celebrating the 45th anniversary of Iceland's independence from
Denmark.
   Tony is flying a single-engine Cessna 210 Centurion turboprop
plane with his father, Gary Aliengena, at his side.
   An escort plane is carrying his mother, Susan Aliengena, his
10-year-old sister Alaina; his Soviet pen pal, Roman Tcheremnykh;
and Soviet and American journalists.
   ``His landings just keep on improving,'' Mrs. Aliengena said as
she watched her son bring down his plane on Saturday.
   Aliengena, a real estate developer and devoted pilot, began
teaching his son to fly at age 4, at first holding the boy on his
lap.
   ``I'm tired and I'm really glad to be here as this is one of the
longest legs of the trip,'' Tony said as he got out of his plane
after the five-hour flight from Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland.
   The family set out June 5 from John Wayne Airport at Costa Mesa,
Calif.
   They planned to leave Iceland for Norway on Sunday to continue
the 19,000-mile trip, dubbed Friendship Flight '89. From there they
fly to Sweden, the Soviet Union and onward to Alaska and home.
   Tony is carrying letters from American schoolchildren to their
Soviet peers and an 800-foot ``friendship scroll'' signed by about
200,000 American youngsters that he plans to present to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   ``Gorbachev will be meeting us so long as nothing happens,'' Mrs.
Aliengena said.
   Tony became the youngest person to fly across the United States
in April 1988.
   An escort plane carrying a Soviet journalist and a documentary
film crew was forced to turn back to Greenland on Friday evening
because of a malfunction.

   The slayings of three civil rights workers
25 years ago focused national attention on Mississippi's segregated
society, and people here hope a special commemoration this week will
highlight how it has changed.
   ``From the beginning there was a realization that the eyes of
this nation and of the world literally were going to turn to
Mississippi on June 21,'' said Secretary of State Dick Molpus, who
has been active in planning the event.
   ``We may never have another opportunity to show what the real
Mississippi is now,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, citizens of Philadelphia, Miss., and Philadelphia,
Pa., will join for a series of events marking the 1964 murders of
Andrew Goodman, a 20-year-old white New York resident, James Chaney,
a 21-year-old black Meridian resident, and Henry Schwerner, a
24-year-old white New Yorker.
   The three had been conducting a black voter registration drive
when they left the site of a burned black church in Neshoba County.
They were arrested on a traffic violation and taken to jail in
Philadelphia, but were released and disappeared on June 21, 1964.
Their bodies were found 44 days later buried in an earthen dam.
   Twenty-one whites were arrested in the shooting deaths. Murder
charges were dropped in state court but seven men were later
convicted for violating federal civil rights laws.
   A fictionalized account of the murders and other events of the
era were portrayed in the Academy Award-winning movie ``Mississippi
Burning.'' The movie's release late last year returned national
attention to Philadelphia.
   ``Some of us here deeply feel that there should be a
commemorative for those boys,'' said Fenton Deweese, a member of the
steering committee for the ``Philadelphia to Philadelphia'' project.
   ``All they were trying to do was to get people to vote,'' said
Deweese, who is white. ``That's such an American thing to do and for
them to be killed for it ... you can see how ludicrous it was for
people to be afraid.
   ``I think their murders were a catalyst to the whole civil rights
movement. That's why it's important that this be commemorated,'' he
said.
   Among the day's scheduled events in Philadelphia, Miss., a town
of about 6,500 people, are an ecumenical service at the Mount Zion
United Methodist Church, the church where Goodman, Chaney and
Schwerner had been the night they disappeared. A picnic and speeches
also are planned.
   Family members and two other groups are planning a memorial
caravan from Philadelphia, to Washington and New York, ending with a
special observance at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New
York. It will reverse the route of the three men to Philadelphia,
about 60 miles northeast of Jackson.
   ``The people of Philadelphia wanted to do like an ostrich, just
bury their heads in the sand and hope it would go away,'' said Ivory
Lyles, who is black and chairman of the steering committee. ``But
(the murders were) a tremendous part of history, and until you
acknowledge a part of history and put it in its proper perspective,
you're going to be confronted with it.''
   Some Philadelphia residents were skeptical about the event at
first, Lyles said, but now it has the backing of the vast majority.
   ``The real story in Philadelphia, Miss., is the number of local
leaders that have moved behind this effort,'' Molpus said.
   ``I hope it will show how the community 25 years later has tried
to do some positive and constructive things by honoring the memory
of those three civil rights workers and the principles they stood
for,'' said Stanley Dearman, editor of the Neshoba Democrat, a
weekly newspaper and a steering committee member. ``It shows what
can be done and I hope it can spill over into other areas of
community life.''
   But racism can still be found in the town, Deweese said.
   ``If you want to go down the street and find somebody who will
say `nigger,' you can still find them,'' he said. ``You can find
them in Meridian, you can find them in Philadelphia, Pa. They're
easy to find in a small town and I could point them out to you.
   ``But you would be doing us a great disservice because they in no
way represent the community.''

<HEAD>US Will Propose Plans for Verifying Elimination of Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say they will ask the Soviets at
talks that open Monday to agree to test plans for verifying
elimination of some weapons as a means of speeding up the proposed
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   ``The goal is not to delay, the goal is to accelerate,'' said a
senior Pentagon official. He said unclear methods of verification
had flawed some previous arms control pacts and delayed negotiation
and eventual Senate ratification of others.
   ``Instead of treating verification as the caboose on the train,
and treating it at the end or after the end, during ratification
debates, I think that we will probably see an effort to bring that
to a higher priority and get serious movement going on things that
could substantially advance our ability to verify this agreement
when it is done,'' said the official, speaking on condition that he
not be further identified.
   President Bush has decided to make no dramatic changes in the
U.S. position in the START talks, which resume in Geneva on Monday
after a recess that began last November, his spokesman said last
week. The treaty would eliminate 30 percent to 50 percent of
long-range superpower nuclear weapons.
   Bush delayed reopening the talks pending completion of a
``strategic review,'' a process that apparently yielded new ideas on
verification.
   ``The previous administration left an excellent foundation on
which to build,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters Friday, saying there would be only ``relatively minor
changes'' from the Reagan administration.
   But Bush wants to take advantage of the new Soviet openness to
test methods of verifying cuts in some of the long-range ballistic
missiles already agreed upon under the draft treaty, said the
Pentagon official.
   The official declined to disclose the exact nature of the
contemplated tests, but he said they would not include one proposed
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to verify the presence of
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles aboard submarines.
   The administration has endorsed objections by the U.S. Navy to
Gorbachev's proposal to ban that category of missiles, an impasse
that remains one of the major obstacles to completion of the treaty.
   Also unresolved is a U.S. call for a ban on mobile missiles, a
class of weapon the Soviets have deployed but the United States has
not.
   Verifying numbers of mobile missiles on either side may be an
unsolvable problem despite the use of satellites and on-site
inspection, said the Pentagon official, although he declined to
specify whether the new U.S. ideas attempted to resolve that issue.
   ``The START process is basically a sound process. A lot has been
accomplished in these negotiations with the Soviets. We don't want
to throw that away,'' said the Pentagon official.
   ``Even on a number of elements where we have achieved a
surprising degree of agreement with the Soviets, there are some very
big verification problems that we can see already,'' said the
official.
   ``Clearly, one of the areas that has been the subject of the
greatest attention is the subject of mobile ICBMs (intercontinental
ballistic missiles) and what their place would be under the START
agreement,'' said the official.
   The Soviet Union has deployed two mobile missile systems,
designated by the Pentagon as the SS-24 and SS-25, whereas the
United States has not developed one. The administration has asked
Congress to approve the deployment of rail-based MX missiles, with
10 warheads apiece, and to fund development of the Midgetman, with
one or two warheads apiece.
   ``The biggest problems about mobiles are for verification and for
breakout. And until we see that solutions to those problems can be
found, then there are very strong arguments in favor of continuing
the ban'' insisted on by President Reagan, the official said.
   U.S. officials will propose ``actually going out and doing some
things that would give us the kind of knowledge on the basis of
which we could say, `Well, it turns out we can verify this thing
with greater confidence than we thought, because there are certain
things that we can observe that we didn't realize went along with
that system,'' said the official.
   ``Or alternatively, we could say, `Well it turns out that what we
thought would be a sufficient level of inspection isn't good enough,
because when you get there, there is a problem that we hadn't
uncovered before. ...
   ``We will have had the kind of experience that would allow us to
say with a great deal more confidence how good our verification is
and be able to improve it before we get to the end of the treaty
instead of just having to find out afterward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nation Awash in `Sea of Garbage,' Congress Is Warned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are generating more than half a ton
of garbage a year per person and a clear national policy is needed
to deal with ways to dispose of it, a congressional study says.
   The study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment
said that during the past decade the federal government has largely
ignored the nation's garbage problems, focusing instead on the
control of hazardous wastes.
   ``Today we find ourselves facing growing mounds of trash ...
(and) many areas of the country are experiencing shortfalls of
landfill capacity,'' said the study.
   The report said that more than 160 million tons of municipal
solid waste are produced each year with 80 percent placed in
landfills that are rapidly reaching capacity.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said the study makes clear that ``our society
must rapidly reduce the escalating generation'' of its garbage.
   ``The age of disposables, from diapers to fast food packaging, is
leaving our communities awash in a sea of garbage,'' said Dingell.
   While the report encouraged the movement toward recycling many
waste products and disposing of other wastes through burning, it
said neither of those two options are expected to eliminate the need
for additional landfills.
   The study suggested that in the years to come the federal
government must play a greater part in dealing with the garbage
problem _ now left mostly to state and local officials.
   Among the options outlined by the study is that the federal
government establish a mechanism by which states could enter into
agreements to deal with garbage disposal on a regional basis.
   Congress also could require states to ensure that adequate
capacity for garbage disposal is available within their borders. It
also could direct the federal Environmental Protection Agency to
develop guidelines for locating landfills and help resolve local
disputes over where landfills should be located, said the report.
   Dealing with the nation's garbage problems in the years to come
``will require strong federal leadership ... (and) Congress has the
opportunity to provide the basis for such leadership,'' said the
study.

<HEAD>Papandreou Fighting for Survival in Greek Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou blew a kiss to
half a million supporters and retreated from the podium at his final
campaign rally, leaving voters to decide Sunday if the gesture
signaled hail or farewell.
   Papandreou is battling for political survival. He trails
opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis in polls and has been hurt
by financial scandals in his government, his divorce from his
American-born wife, Margaret, and his affair with a woman half his
age.
   Still, the 70-year-old premier, who has dominated Greek politics
eight years, predicted at the rally Friday that he would triumph.
   ``On Monday, I will be premier,'' Papandreou shouted to
thunderous applause for his Panhellenic Socialist Movement, known as
PASOK. ``On June 19 the new four-year term begins, our four-year
term.''
   Mitsotakis and his center-right New Democracy Party lead by about
11 percentage points in the latest polls. If that margin holds,
Mitsotakis could become the next premier with 46 percent of the vote
because of Greece's election law.
   Greece's 7.89 million eligible voters are required by law to cast
ballots in the elections for the 300 seats in the unicameral
Parliament. Twenty-five parties are fielding candidates.
   The Coalition of Left and Progress, a new alliance of the Greek
Communist Party and the Greek Left Party, hopes to gain bargaining
power if no party can win an outright majority Sunday.
   But both PASOK and New Democracy say they would reject any
communist support to form a government, a stance that could lead to
months of instability and new elections in the fall.
   Papandreou ended his campaign Friday with a series of
well-orchestrated rallies in Constitution Square in central Athens.
Mitsotakis did the same on Thursday. Campaigning was not allowed
Saturday.
   The rallies are festivals of blaring music and joyous crowds lost
in a sea of party flags and the smoke of exploding fireworks.
   But many say the campaign has been the most invective since the
return to democracy after the 1967-74 military dictatorship.
   Personal attacks have overshadowed political issues in Greece,
which has the European Economic Community's highest inflation at 14
percent, largest public-sector deficit and weakest currency.
   Mitsotakis supports a free-market economy and Papandreou portrays
himself as a defender of the welfare state.
   However, Elias Tsotakos, a financial consultant in Athens, said
the business community believes ``there is not a great deal of
difference'' between PASOK and New Democracy on major issues.
   ``Both will try to reduce the huge public-sector deficit, keep
interest rates up to reduce inflation, reduce the foreign debt, and
both will try to deregulate banks and some financial services and
privatize some public corporations,'' he said.
   Papandreou came to power in 1981 promising to pull out of NATO
and the EEC and to close U.S. military bases in Greece. Now he says
the country benefits from the organizations, and he is negotiating a
new base agreement with the Americans.
   Mitsotakis says he favors closer ties with the West and the EEC,
and that NATO and U.S. bases in Greece are vital to the country's
defense.
   With few clear distinctions on political issues, the campaign has
become personal.
   Nude photographs of Papandreou's 35-year-old fiancee, Dimitra
Liani, became almost daily fixtures in opposition newspapers.
   A pro-government newspaper published a photograph of a young
Mitsotakis flanked by two German soldiers. The picture implied that
the former resistance fighter, twice arrested and sentenced to death
by the Germans, collaborated with the Nazis.
   Mitsotakis focused on multimillion-dollar financial scandals that
have led to the firing or resignation of eight members of
Papandreou's government, including Deputy Premier Agamemnon
Koutsogiorgas. Papandreou denies wrongdoing.

   Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia may
benefit from the diversion of American and other foreign investment
originally intended for the strife-torn Chinese mainland, prominent
U.S. foreign traders say.
   ``Those who have large investments in China are going to try to
continue, barring anything more cataclysmic, but it is clear and
logical that others are going to be very hesitant to make
commitments until they see if this is the beginning of the end,''
said Thomas J. White, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Council of
American Chambers of Commerce.
   Leaders of individual U.S. chambers from East Asia tended to
agree. They met reporters Friday after the annual week of meetings
in Washington between Asia-based American business executives and
members of the U.S. government and Congress.
   Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia represent ``the next best
alternative'' to China in terms of labor costs and business
environment and because of their close association with potential
investors, White said.
   Offshore Taiwan is not an alternative for the low-cost labor
ventures attracted to the mainland, said Taiwan-based Joseph
Coffman, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in the
Republic of China.
   Even before trouble surfaced in China, many overseas Chinese
entrepreneurs had switched to Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines
to take advantage of low labor costs, he said.
   If mainland officials ``ever get their act together, the market
potential is mind-boggling _ a market of 450 million young people
under 21,'' Coffman said. With such a market at stake, ``you can
understand the anxiety businessmen now feel.''
   For those already invested in China, ``it certainly behooves them
to try to derive something out of that investment,'' he said, but
others would be well advised to wait and see. Coffman also said
tremendous competition for foreign exchange among the different
mainland regions and cities might make it possible to make secure
investments in Chinese locations distant from Beijing.
   Bangkok-based Jerry L. Loupee, a vice chairman of the
Asia-Pacific council, said the Bush administration did the right
thing in stopping short of breaking relations with China to protest
the violent crackdown on Beijing's pro-democracy movement.
   He voiced hope that China ``will get the message'' represented by
other Asian countries drawing away some of its investment, and
create secure conditions for business to continue.
   White, who is president of Phelps Dodge Thailand, a subsidiary of
the U.S. firm, agreed. Urging that the United States coordinate
Chinese economic policy with its allies, he said, ``I hope we don't
become the only nation blocking ourselves out of the market by
taking sanctions and getting miles out in front of our competitors.''

<HEAD>Century-Old Color Prints by Mary Cassatt Get First Major Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Color prints by Mary Stevenson Cassatt will get
their first major show at the National Gallery of Art beginning
Sunday, 100 years after she started making them in France.
   Cassatt's paintings are often exhibited but this will be the
first comprehensive show to include all 23 of her color etchings.
They were made by drawing lines with a hardened point of metal or
diamond on copper plates, two or three plates to each picture.
   She printed the final work from the plates on high quality paper,
often applying several colors of ink to a single plate.
   The exhibit also includes prints made from the individual plates,
showing how the pictures developed.
   Born in 1844, Cassatt took her first trip to France at the age of
seven and settled there 20 years later. Her father was an investment
banker, once mayor of Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. Though he at
first opposed her career, he and her mother later lived with her in
Paris and liked being part of the French art world.
   The only American among the original French impressionists, she
was introduced to the group by the painter Edgar Degas. She died in
1926 at her home north of Paris, the Chateau de Beaufresne, which
she bought from her earnings as an artist.
   Cassatt's interest in print-making came from admiration for
Japanese etchers of the previous century, especially Kitagaro
Utamaro. She collected their work and was especially impressed by an
1890 exhibit in Paris.
   ``You must see the Japanese _ come as soon as you can,'' she
wrote to Berthe Morisot, another of the impressionist painters.
   The centerpiece of this show, a series of 10 prints on upper
class women's life in Paris, derives from the Japanese practice of
producing this type of work in sets. But instead of the Japanese
subjects, often actors and prostitutes, she favored pictures more
acceptable for Americans of the Victorian era _ ladies taking tea,
writing a letter or sitting under a lamp.
   A favorite subject of Cassatt's was a mother with a small child.
She never married or had children of her own.
   The exhibit will be at the National Gallery's East Building until
Aug. 27. It will go to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Mass.,
Sept. 9 to Nov. 5 and to the Williams College Museum of Art,
Williamstown, Mass., Nov. 24 to Jan. 21, 1990.

<HEAD>Father Accompanies Handicapped Son To College For 13 Years</HEAD>

   Joe Rossetti has huge hands, hands that
have built houses, run a business, and for the past 13 years, taken
notes for his handicapped son so that he might graduate from college.
   Rossetti laughs when you mention his hands. In the month since
his son's graduation from Providence College, the 62-year-old has
been working on long-neglected projects around the house. ``I've got
a blister,'' he says with amazement. ``I've never had such soft
hands before.''
   Rossetti calls his son Carl his ``right-hand man,'' but the truth
is, that's what Carl could call his father.
   Seventeen years ago, when Carl was 15, his neck was broken in a
dirt bike accident.
   After five months in a semi-coma, Carl regained consciousness and
was allowed to return home. Intensive therapy helped him regain
movement on his left side, and his father became his second hand.
   ``I've never seen such devotion in a mother and father in my
life,'' said Shirley Kervick, a dance therapist who helped Carl
regain his ability to walk.
   Carl finished high school with the help of teachers and fellow
students, then enrolled in Providence College's Continuing Education
program.
   Rossetti, whose 1951 Providence College class ring is worn smooth
from years of hard work, went back to school with Carl in 1975.
   ``Carl wanted that degree, and I said, `Well, let's go for it,''
Rossetti said. ``I did it like any parent would do it. Until you're
a parent you don't realize what your parents did for you.''
   Rossetti makes it clear he wasn't the only one who has helped
Carl.
   ``Behind the battles was my wife. Ann had to be very patient for
the past 17 years,'' Rossetti said.
   When Carl was injured, Rossetti gave up his construction business
and went into real estate. ``I just stopped right then and there,''
he said. ``I had to let everything go.''
   ``As a parent, you love your children, nothing is a sacrifice if
you love them,'' he said.
   Carl took only one course per semester, but Rossetti also spent
two days a week with him at the offices of doctors and therapists.
His next step in therapy involves improving his speech, which only
those who know him well can understand.
   ``If you want to do it right, it's a full-time job,'' Rossetti
said. ``I was just fortunate I could work my schedule around Carl.''
That meant sometimes working into the early-morning hours to keep
his family financially afloat.
   ``It's a good thing I'm a nocturnal person,'' Rossetti said. As
for sleep, ``if I get three or four hours, I'm great.''
   Carl's dedication to college was unfailing for 10 years, but ``he
expected to get everything back _ when he didn't, he started to get
frustrated,'' Rossetti said.
   ``This is what I had to avoid. I wanted to keep him busy,'' he
said. The two have taken up sailing and have enrolled in a
handicapped ski program. They've also ``seen a lot of movies,''
Rossetti said.
   Carl, who received his bachelor of arts degree last month, was
the third Rossetti child to graduate from Providence College.
   ``I think this graduation of Carl Rossetti is a testimony to what
the human spirit can overcome,'' said the dean of continuing
education, Roger L. Pearson.
   The college honored the elder Rossetti with a special
acknowledgement during the awards banquet for the graduates.
   Of all his children's commencement ceremonies, ``this was the
hardest,'' Rossetti said. ``I didn't want anything to go wrong.'' He
was worried about Carl, who still walks with a limp, negotiating the
stairs.
   In the end, ``I think I was as happy to graduate as he was,'' he
said.
   Now Carl is looking to the future, and says he can get a law
degree in just three more years.
   ``Please, give us a break,'' his father pleads.
   Rossetti wants his son to manage a small shopping center complex
he plans to build.
   ``I said, `Carl, we're going back to work, and if you can't swing
a hammer, you'd better grab a 2-by-4. You've got to put that
education to work,''' he said.

   The unrest in Beijing has put the lives of tens of
thousands of Chinese students and scholars in this country in limbo,
and even the children of the elite fear they must turn away from
their homeland.
   ``If China becomes a democratic country, I will go back,'' said
Qian Songnian, a theoreticial physicist at Dartmouth College. ``But
in this situation, certainly not.''
   Chinese students began arriving in the United States in small
numbers in the years after President Nixon's visit to China. The
first large exchanges began in 1978, said Huang Zhengdong, a Yale
University law student who heads a semi-official organization of
Chinese students in the United States.
   The figure of 40,000 Chinese students now in the United States is
quoted by such groups as the Returned Student Association in
Beijing. But the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said a
recent computer check found 73,000 Chinese with active student visas.
   The Returned Student Association says there are an additional
40,000 Chinese students in countries other than the United States.
   The majority here are graduate students in science, engineering
and mathematics, mostly at major universities. And many are the sons
and daugters of China leaders.
   The number of student visas granted jumped from 17 in 1977 to 201
in 1978, and has soared to 18,000 new visas granted in fiscal 1988,
said spokeswoman Frances Jones of the State Department, which does
not keep cumulative figures.
   Before 1980, ``the political requirements were so tight,'' said
Huang. ``Their political backgrounds would be very clean. They came
from families that were not class enemies,'' including families who
fought for the communist revolution, workers, and peasants.
   The political restrictions were eased after 1981, he said, though
a 1987 rule said they had to show they ``love the motherland and
cherish socialism.''
   In practice, Huang said, ``People who passed the academic
examinations usually were allowed as long as their political
qualifications were not that bad.''
   California universities are the top U.S. draw, with more than
10,000 Chinese students, followed by New York, Texas, Illinois and
Massachusetts, according to the INS.
   A total of 320,000 Chinese nationals are now in the United
States, INS spokesman Greg Leo said. Following the crackdown,
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh announced that all will be
permitted to stay for at least one year.
   Though the students here are among the best and the brightest of
China, few are sponsored by their government.
   By one estimate, only 2,000 to 3,000 students receive full
government scholarships. Most graduate students are funded by their
host universities. At Stanford University, for example, not one of
the 150-odd Chinese students has a government subsidy, said Karlene
Dickey, associate dean of graduate studies.
   While official People's Republic of China media are condemning
the outbreak of ``Western bourgeois liberalism,'' it has been
fashionable for China's elite to send its sons and daughters to
study abroad where they are exposed to such ideas.
   Students and academics here said most exchange students are the
children of party members, professionals, intellectuals, teachers
and technocrats. Children and grandchildren of Politburo members are
believed to be among them.
   ``For those guys, the front door and the back door were all
open,'' said Huang.
   A University of Florida administrator added, ``I don't ever
recall coming across someone who said, `My parents are farmers.'''
Richard Downie, who has worked with Chinese students for nearly a
decade at the university's Gainesville campus, recalls one early
group who pooled their money and bought a Cadillac, which they drove
to Canada during spring break.
   ``I thought it was a great joke, because here comes a group of
people from communist China, and the first thing they buy is the
great symbol of American capitalism, the Cadillac,'' Downie said.
   Many of the students assume their government sends a few students
to keep tabs on their classmates.
   Qian, who arrived in 1981, said he believes a student in his
dormitory at the University of Maryland was an informer. When a
female classmate struck up a romance with a Taiwanese, she was
summoned to the Chinese embassy and reprimanded, he said.
   As students wrestle with whether to return home, their
government's scrutiny has taken on a more ominous tone.
   Huang said he saw someone videotaping the pro-democracy
demonstration June 5 he helped organize in New York City. He said he
was warned through intermediaries ``not to go too far,'' and his
letters have arrived opened.
   Huang, asked if he would return, only laughed.
   ``My picture and my image (are) on CNN and newspapers,'' he said.
``So certainly this is not the right time to go back.''

   Young demonstrators broke away from a
protest of the novel ``The Satanic Verses'' on Saturday and ran
through Bradford's main shopping district assaulting people and
damaging cars and shops.
   Denis O'Toole, the assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire,
said there were some arrests but no serious injuries. Two policemen
were slightly injured, he said.
   More than 200 police, some in riot gear, were deployed in an
attempt to disperse the youths, who pelted them with stones and
cans. Some youths stole soft drinks from a truck stopped at a
traffic light.
   ``A number of assaults took place as well as damage to shops and
vehicles,'' O'Toole said. He said the incident began as the
demonstration by 3,000 people outside the town hall was ending.
   Liaqat Hussain, general secretary of the Bradford Council of
Mosques, which organized the demonstration, denounced the
troublemakers.
   ``We are very sad it occurred. We were hoping for a peaceful
rally,'' he said. ``It was only a small proup of youngsters involved
in the disturbances. The majority of people were very peaceful.''
   O'Toole praised the council for its organization and attempts to
prevent any trouble.
   The controversy over ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel by Salman
Rushdie, began in January in Bradford, the English Midlands city
with Britian's largest Moslem population.
   The book was later banned in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh,
Malaysia, Kenya, Senegal, Nigeria and other Arab nations. Riots by
people opposed to the book left 19 people dead in India and Pakistan.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by portraying
the wives of the Prophet Mohammed as prostitutes and insinuating
that Mohammed wrote the Koran himself rather than receiving it from
God.
   Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family in
India, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iran's spiritual
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his execution. Khomeini
died this month.

<HEAD>Actor William Hurt Sued by Dancer Who Claims to Be Common-Law Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The divorce claim against actor William Hurt by
his former lover goes to court Monday where she is asking for half
of his earnings over the past 6{ years even though she admits they
were never formally married.
   Hurt, who married someone else in March, is estimated by the
plantiff's lawyer to be worth about $10 million.
   Sandra Jennings, 32, is basing her claim on four weeks that she
lived with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., while he was filming ``The Big
Chill.'' South Carolina recognizes common-law marriages, while New
York, where they lived most of the time, does not.
   ``This is a divorce action,'' said Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard
Golub. ``I want to establish the marriage, and then I think she
should get half of everything he earned from 1982'' to when they are
divorced.
   Jennings, a former dancer at the New York City Ballet, said Hurt,
39, treated her _ and introduced her to others _ as his wife. But
the judge who is hearing the case beginning Monday has already said
that the burden of proving that there was a common-law marriage,
based on South Carolina law, will be difficult.
   Hurt's lawyer, Frances Jacobs, would not comment, referring
questions to publicist Lois Smith, who denied a common-law marriage
existed. Hurt ``never claimed or pretended they were married,'' she
said.
   Hurt, who also has starred in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,''
``Broadcast News,'' ``Gorky Park,'' and ``The Accidental Tourist,''
lived with Jennings for several months in South Carolina while
shooting ``The Big Chill,'' Jennings says. For most of that time he
was still married to actress Mary Beth Hurt.
   The actress divorced Hurt on Dec. 3, 1982, after seven years of
marriage. Hurt learned of it on Dec. 9. Jennings is basing her
marriage claim on the period from Dec. 9 to Jan. 10, 1983, the day
they left Beaufort. At the time, Jennings says, she was pregnant
with Hurt's son.
   Jennings said she gave birth to Alexander Devon Hurt, now 6,
because she thought her relationship with Hurt was permanent. In
court papers, she said she left Hurt in 1984 because he was
physically and verbally abusive, claiming he once slapped her while
she held their then-5-day-old son. On another occasion, after a
drinking binge, she says, he urinated on their couch.
   Smith said Hurt was treated for alcohol abuse at the Betty Ford
Clinic and has been a member of Alcoholics Anonymous for about 2{
years. She denied that Hurt ever hit Jennings.
   Jennings aborted two pregnancies before giving birth to Alex,
Golub told State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann at a
recent hearing.
   Hurt acknowledged he is Alex's father and has been giving
Jennings $65,000 a year for support, Smith said.
   Jennings sued last year to get $16,000, a month claiming she and
her child were living in near poverty. She later decided to argue
that a legal marriage existed under South Carolina law.
   Until the marriage issue can be decided, Silbermann refused to
give Jennings temporary alimony or child support, ruling that
$65,000 a year seemed adequate.
   Silbermann also noted that South Carolina does not automatically
regard two people living together as having a common-law marriage,
especially where one of them is already married.
   She said that if the relationship was illicit at its inception,
the law presumes the relationship retains its illicit character. The
person who claims a common-law marriage exists must prove it,
Silbermann said.
   ``The evidence is therefore thin, complicating a heavy burden of
proof under South Carolina law,'' the judge said.
   Golub says he intends to call Hurt as his first witness Monday
when the hearing starts on whether the actor and Jennings are
married.
   Hurt moved actress Marlee Matlin, his costar in ``Children of a
Lesser God,'' into his Manhattan apartment in November 1985 and
Jennings said in court papers that this caused her ``great emotional
distress.'' She said her name was still on the apartment mailbox at
the time.
   Hurt married Heidi Henderson, band leader Skitch Henderson's
daughter, in March.
   Golub's position is that the blond, bespectacled Hurt ``is a
bigamist because he got married while he is already married to my
client.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Sergei Grigoryants,
award-winning editor of the liberal journal Glasnost, says he has
launched an independent daily news service to carry Soviet news to
Western Europe and the United States.
   Grigoryants, on his first visit to the United States, discussed
the service Friday at a reception by the private human rights group
Freedom House, a partner in the venture. Grigoryants said he will
sign an agreement with the with the organization Monday, but that
many details have yet to be worked out.
   Daily Glasnost, an offshoot of the magazine in which Grigoryants
has tested the limits of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
openness campaign, would be the latest in a number of Soviet
publications trying to go beyond official dispatches about Soviet
events.
   ``Recently, efforts have been made to backtrack in all spheres _
economic, and certainly, of course, in the nationalities question _
to maintain stability and to keep receiving Western credits,''
Grigoryants said in an interview.
   The nationalities question refers to the ethnic and religious
unrest that has struck several of the Soviet Union's republics in
recent months. An April 19 attack by authorities on Georgian
demonstrators left 20 dead, threatening to set back Soviet efforts
to put aside human rights as an issue in dealings with the West.
   ``There is very little time to achieve something before the
situation in the Soviet Union becomes worse,'' Grigoryants said.
``Essentially, that's what we're all doing.''
   Several unofficial publications are distributed in the West,
including Grigoryants' Glasnost and a daily digest of stories
appearing in the dissident journal Express-Khonrika.
   Glasnost has been translated and distributed in the West since
its inception two years ago. The English-language version is
translated and distributed by the New York-based Center for
Democracy.
   The Soviet government's dissemination of news worldwide is
dominated by the official news agency Tass and by broadcasts of
Radio Moscow, in addition to the main Communist Party and government
newspapers.
   Grigoryants said his editors already have begun sending Daily
Glasnost installments in Russian by telephone facsimile machines to
Paris, where they are translated into French and Spanish for
distribution to newspapers. He said the service will be expanded
with transmissions to New York for translation into English, but he
wasn't sure when.
   The plans come despite what Grigoryants, who has served several
jail terms for his activitism, called the Soviet authorities'
constant harassment of his magazine. Last week, he was given the
International Federation of Newspaper Publishers' 1989 Golden Pen of
Freedom award for his work on the magazine.
   In April 1988, agents of the KGB state security agency and the
Interior Ministry raided his suburban Moscow apartment where the
journal is published and confiscated a donated computer, files,
printing equipment, and hundreds of copies of the magazine ready for
distribution, he said. They have not been returned.
   ``They even took my English pipe,'' said the 48-year-old editor.

<HEAD>Illinois Offers $33 Million Package to Save Sears Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois has offered $33 million to Sears, Roebuck
and Co. to keep its retail headquarters in the state it has called
home for more than 100 years.
   Sears has said it will announce by the end of the month whether
its 6,000-employee Merchandise Group will remain in Illinois or pull
up stakes. There was no Sears comment on the state's offer Friday.
   The Merchandise Group, which has a $411 million annual payroll
and produces about $19.4 million a year in state and local taxes, is
being moved from Sears Tower, the world's tallest building, which
Sears has put up for sale.
   Speculation for a new site has focused on an area west of
Chicago, Dallas, and two North Carolina cities _ Raleigh and
Charlotte.
   Sears' decision to sell Sears Tower and shift the Merchandise
Group to less costly quarters is part of a broad cost-cutting effort
announced last year by the nation's largest retailer, which is
battling inroads by discount chains and other stores.
   But the state of Illinois and city of Chicago are putting up
their own battle to keep Sears from leaving.
   Gov. James R. Thompson signed legislation Friday earmarking $33
million to the company's incentive package.
   ``This is a major retention effort for our state,'' Thompson said
in a statement. ``Sears employs 43,000 people in 857 facilities
throughout Illinois, making it the state's largest private-sector
employer.''
   Chicago already has offered unspecified incentives to Sears.
Mayor Richard M. Daley said he thinks Sears will announce a decision
by Friday.
   The state aid approved Friday could be used for land, site
improvements or infrastructure. It can be applied to any Illinois
site, and could be used for direct purchases by the state, or for
grants to Sears or local governments, said Jay Hedges, director of
the state's Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.

   Thousands of Afghan soldiers captured a
strategic city near Jalalabad and killed more than 200 guerrillas in
a major offensive involving artillery and air support, the
government said Saturday.
   ``Our troops are in complete control not only of Jalalabad but
also of areas beyond the city, and we are pushing the enemy'' toward
Pakistan, Mohammad Nabi Amani, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
told reporters.
   Amani said the recently completed offensive by 10,000 government
troops captured the city of Khushgumbad, 20 miles east of Jalalabad.
``Our victory is very crucial because we have an important airport
at Khushgumbad.''
   The city of 30,000 was considered a guerrilla stronghold.
   The eastern city of Jalalabad was the guerrillas' first major
target after Soviet troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 from
Afghanistan. The rebels predicted a quick victory, but a stalemate
occurred soon after the battle began three months ago.
   ``We are no more just defending positions, we are now on the
offensive,'' Amani said. ``The areas are not only under our control,
but we are setting up permanent military posts.''
   President Najib has called on the United States and Pakistan,
which support the guerrillas, to press for a negotiated settlement
to the war, which Najib says the guerrillas are incapable of
winning. The insurgents control much of Afghanistan's countryside
but have been unable to take major cities.
   The state-run Bakhtar news ageny said 229 guerrillas were killed
and 150 wounded in the offensive. It said 86 rocket launchers and
18,200 machine-gun cartridges were captured. The report did not
mention government casualties.
   It was not immediately possible to verify the government's claims.
   An Asian diplomat, who monitors military developments in
Afghanistan, said such a victory would be a major blow to the
insurgents.
   ``Jalalabad was the prestige battle, and if the government is now
saying it is pushing the rebels further east it is a big blow to the
insurgents,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   The government is working overtime to condemn
liberal political thought, but there has been no hint the campaign
will widen to take on what conservatives have called ``Western
spiritual pollution,'' such as sidewalk pool tables, privately owned
bars, and miniskirts.
   The military attack on student pro-democracy protesters and their
supporters this month has been followed by more than 1,200 arrests
and an intense media campaign condemning any suggestion that the
power of the ruling Communist Party be limited.
   Political purges are expected, starting with party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who reportedly has been stripped of his power.
   So far, the cultural and economic aspects of Western culture have
escaped attack.
   The crackdown seems likely to increase the great divide between
the economic sphere, where selected Western methods are studied and
adopted, and the political sphere, where Western philosophy is taboo.
   Industrialist Lee Iacocca's autobiography is acceptable, for
example, but not the Declaration of Independence.
   For a government based on Marx's tenet that economics determines
everything else about a society, it is an interesting and
tension-ridden division.
   This division is at the heart of conflict between senior leader
Deng Xiaoping on the one hand, and dissident Fang Lizhi and the
student protesters on the other.
   For more than a decade, Deng has sought to shake up an economy
devastated by collectivization, political battles and an economic
planning system that discouraged initiative and bailed out failing
factories. In economics, Deng said, pragmatism is best: ``Black cat,
white cat, it doesn't matter as long as it catches mice.''
   But Deng always stressed the complete authority of the Communist
Party. Two previous efforts to achieve a democratic breakthrough
through public outcry _ the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement and
1986-87 nationwide student marches _ were put down with arrests and
purges.
   Fang, who has taken refuge with his wife in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, won a wide following among fellow intellectuals for arguing
that economic and political reforms cannot be divorced.
   Although there is no evidence Fang encouraged the student
protesters in their spring campaign, as the government charged, they
echoed his position. Many economic problems, they said, such as
inflation and shortages, were linked to official corruption and a
controlled press that dared not expose it.
   Many students praised the example of the Soviet Union, where
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has allowed a relative ferment of
political debate.
   If the students had been willing to make their suggestions to
government-sponsored youth groups and student unions, there might
have been no great stir.
   But they rejected the official bodies as not representing them
and demanded a direct say. Their stance implicitly challenged the
ability of the party to represent them as well. This, it appears,
was going too far.
   Many intellectuals had hoped China's economic reforms would carry
over to the political system, regardless of Deng's intentions. In
the six months before the protests began, some thought this was
happening.
   Small groups of intellectuals held ``salons'' to read poetry and
discuss democracy. National television broadcast a lengthy series
that criticized China's traditional culture as backward, and
although Vice President Wang Zhen denounced it, the authors were not
punished. Greater daring was allowed in art and film.
   These developments may have angered aging leaders, including Deng.
   One Western diplomat said the start of the student protests in
mid-April may have been seized on by the conservatives as an
opportunity to embarrass relative liberals such as Zhao.
   The movement for greater political reform flagged several times
over its seven-week span, but the government passed repeated chances
to end it peacefully.
   Instead, according to this theory, it waited until sympathetic
teachers, researchers, government workers and even soldiers were
infected with the students' enthusiasm and joined in marches,
revealing their true thinking. Then it condemned the protests as
counterrevolutionary and ordered the army to put them down.
   If this theory holds, purges of intellectuals and government
workers can be expected to be fairly extensive. On the other hand,
the leadership has a stake in restoring normal production as soon as
possible, and heavy purges would make this difficult.
   Regardless of how many people are purged, Chinese interviewed
since the crackdown predicted more protests for democracy within a
few years.
   One explained: Deng believes he can open a window to the outside
and put up a screen to keep out the flies. But even the air from
outside is infected with democracy.

   Hurricane Barbara spun to life off the coast
of Mexico in the Pacific Ocean on Saturday with sustained winds of
74 mph, prompting forecasters to warn ships to steer clear.
   The hurricane was moving northwest at 5 mph on a path that would
miss land, said forecaster Martin Nelson with the National Weather
Service in Coral Gables, Fla.
   ``It's just barely a hurricane,'' said Nelson. ``Generally these
kinds of hurricanes just work their way into the Pacific shipping
lanes then die at sea.''
   The storm was upgraded from a tropical storm to a hurricane at
7:30 a.m. when the winds hit a sustained 74 mph with gusts of as
much as 90 mph.
   By 10:30 a.m. PDT, Hurricane Barbara was located at 15.0 north
latitude, 108.0 west longitude, or about 550 miles south-southeast
of the tip of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
   The hurricane was forecast grow stronger through Monday, then
start to lose strength, said Nelson.

   Canadian and U.S. military officials
are investigating why two duffle bags and a parachute fell from a
U.S. Air Force jet, landing on a baseball field and a nearby house.
   The incident occurred Thursday, only six weeks after a chunk of
ice fell from a commercial plane and slammed into another baseball
diamond in the same area near Winnipeg International Airport.
   That chunk of debris landed near some children.
   ``They say lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice, but
I guess in this case it did,'' airport manager George Elliot said
Friday.
   The luggage and parachute fell from one of two F-4 Phantom jets
that were leaving Winnipeg on their way to Duluth, Minn.
   The planes were from the George Air Force Base in Victorville,
Calif. and were en route home after taking part in a training
exercise in Winnipeg.
   Winnipeg National Defense spokesman Maj. Bob Butt said military
officials on both sides of the border want answers.
   ``It's always a serious matter when objects fall out of planes,''
he said.

   Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt have
their famous father's penchant for vagueness and nonchalance about
their fortunes. As Bunker once said, ``People who know how much they
are worth generally aren't worth very much.''
   The brothers have been forced to find out how much they're worth.
It's a lot less than it once was, but still amounts to hundreds of
millions of dollars spread around the world, according to documents
filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court last week.
   There's a $19 million coin collection, a 2 million-acre
Australian ranch and a nine-acre plot in north Texas, a
2,700-year-old vase and a Dallas bowling alley.
   The documents detail the riches still controlled by two of H.L.
Hunt's eight children. The others are not party to these bankruptcy
cases, the first involving the Hunts' personal _ as opposed to
corporate _ finances after the decline in energy prices, Herbert's
and Bunker's silver speculation in 1979 and 1980 and mammoth claims
by the Internal Revenue Service.
   There is little question the brothers were once billionaires. One
1980 estimate placed Bunker's worth at $2.34 billion and Herbert's
at $1.52 billion. Now, Bunker's filing says his assets amount to
$258.83 million, Herbert's $169.38 million.
   Those figures are far short of the claims against the Hunts. The
IRS alone wants $730.42 million from Bunker and $317.31 million from
Herbert for back taxes and interest. In all, Bunker's debts top $1.5
billion and Herbert's are almost $1.2 billion.
   Both brothers dispute they owe the money, but last September they
and their wives filed for protection from creditors. The case is
moving through U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson's court and
likely will end with liquidation of much of their holdings.
   The documents show a picture of second-generation wealth.
Although still built on their father's oil and gas holdings, it has
spread to cover the largest tract of land in northern Australia;
thoroughbred race horses; large pieces of valuable land in
California, Arizona and Alaska; and coins and other rare artifacts.
   Missing is any mention of pure silver, though government
investigators claim the brothers came within weeks of cornering the
world's silver market.
   While the documents attempt to set out what the brothers own,
they caution, ``valuation of such complex and varied assets raises
difficult issues upon which reasonable minds can differ.''
   Bunker, 63, always has been the bigger of the two brothers, both
physically and monetarily.
   His collection of more than 10,000 ancient Islamic, Roman and
Greek coins is called ``the largest and most valuable privately held
collection of ancient coins in the world.''
   The collection, which sits in vaults at Sotheby's, is worth an
estimated $19 million. Bunker also has a collection of 16 vases,
from 2,700 to 2,500 years old, on exhibit at Fort Worth's Kimbell
Art Museum.
   The contribution of Herbert, 60, to that exhibit consists of 38
ancient bronze statues and artifacts, valued at about $3.5 million,
dating from the Eighth Century to Third Century B.C.
   One of Bunker's companies is Bluegrass Farm Sales Inc., which
owns and leases 2 million acres of Australian farm and ranch land
with an estimated value of $17.5 million.
   There's also a 81,290-acre ranch that sprawls across six counties
in southeastern Oklahoma valued at $11.26 million, and a 9,012-acre
ranch, worth about $18.05 million, that straddles the
Tennessee-Mississippi state line.
   Including his $1.8 million home in suburban Dallas, and $250,000
condominium in Hawaii, his real estate holdings come to $137.88
million and are located in seven states.
   There's also $23.53 million in oil and gas properties, $11.29
million of livestock and thoroughbred race horses and $52.95 million
of other investments, including a $1 million, one-third share of
Bronco Bowl, a 72-lane Dallas bowling alley. Herbert and brother
Lamar Hunt split the other two-thirds.
   Herbert owns a Byzantine coin collection that he values at $2
million. But it might fetch only $1 million if liquidated because of
the limited number of collectors of Byzantine coins, the document
notes.
   Most of Herbert's real estate holdings are contained in
partnerships with family members and longtime business associate A.
Paul Stephens. Herbert's various partnerships with Stephens are
valued at $66.84 million, and mostly involve Paloma Corp.
developments in the Phoenix area.
   Herbert's house, located in University Park, a suburb surrounded
by Dallas, is valued at $1.25 million. He also owns a $200,000 half
interest in a house in the resort of Vail, Colo.
   His oil and gas properties are worth an estimated $77.55 million;
other real estate is valued at $23.23 million; and various other
holdings worth about $2.35 million, including a $10 silver Churchill
commemorative coin and a $200 gold coin money clip.

   Mike Tyson is being sued for $200,000 by
a Florida man who claims he was struck and pushed by the heavyweight
boxing champ outside an upstate New York bar last year.
   John Copeland of Winter Haven, Fla., alleges in the lawsuit that
he sustained ``physical trauma to his arms and body, severe brusies
to his back and emotional distress.''
   The son of the bar's owner told the Albany Times Union a
different story in an account published Saturday.
   ``Mike kind of pushed the guy on the back,'' said Jacob Walthour
Jr., whose father owns the Savoias bar in Hudson, where the incident
allegedly occurred July 23, 1988. ``It was a kind of push like
you're saying, `Hi, how you doing buddy.' He (Copeland) kept saying,
`I can take your best punch. I can take your best punch.'''
   Copeland seeks compensatory damages in the lawsuit filed May 8
for negligence and punitive damages for assault and battery. Each of
the actions is for $100,000 plus interest from the date of the
incident.
   Neither Tyson's lawyers nor Copeland's would comment, the
newspaper reported.

   Kathleen Brown, another member of the
politically prominent California family, is taking a stab a
statewide office.
   Ms. Brown, whose father and brother were both governors, said
Friday she will quit her post as a local public works commissioner
next month to step up her campaign for state treasurer.
   ``One of the things that I think modern campaigns lack is the
ability to touch people and to listen to people and to find out what
it is that they see as the priorities in Sacramento,'' the
42-year-old Democrat said.
   ``It seems everywhere I go there are people there to tell me they
were touched by some positive activity of my father's or my
brother's administration,'' she said. Her father, Edmund G. ``Pat''
Brown Sr., was governor from 1959 to 1966, and her brother, Edmund
G. Jr., known as Jerry, was governor from 1975 to 1983.
   Ms. Brown, who has campaigned part-time during the past six
months for the post held by Republican incumbent Thomas W. Hayes, is
the only major Democratic candidate for the job to emerge so far.
   She was appointed to her $65,333-per-year job on the Los Angeles
Public Works Commission in October 1987 by Mayor Tom Bradley.

   Columnist Art Buchwald, opera stars Robert Merrill

concert kicking off the 12-week season of the 104-year-old Boston
Pops.
   Celebrating its 20th anniversary on the Public Broadcast Service,
``Evening at Pops'' was taped at Boston Symphony Hall last week to
be shown June 25 here and other times in other areas.
   John Williams, who took over as Pops conductor in 1980 after the
death of Arthur Fiedler, said recently that the popularity of the
Pops seems as enduring as the orchestra itself.
   ``I don't think it's complacent to point out that the popularity
of the Pops does not seem to have diminished at all,'' he said.
   But he stressed that the orchestra must ``keep up the search for
a new repertoire, finding new things, discarding things that no
longer work.''
   ``The Pops is famous for delivering a certain glowing good
feeling that it must produce each and every time out,'' Williams
said. ``The amazing thing is that it does.''

<HEAD>Advances Reported On Down's Syndrome And Alzheimer's Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Down's syndrome has been linked to a
defect on a tiny slice of one of the human chromosomes, an important
step toward prevention and treatment of the disorder, researchers
said Saturday.
   In a separate report, researchers also reported progress in
narrowing the search for the defect responsible for one, relatively
uncommon form of Alzheimer's disease.
   In a week of intensive meetings and reviews of scientific
reports, about 700 researchers from around the world announced the
genetic ``mapping'' of about 400 new genes, 53 of them linked to
specific diseases.
   The reports were presented at the Tenth International Workshop on
Human Gene Mapping, held at Yale University.
   The process of gene mapping, in which researchers determine where
a particular gene lies on the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, is a
necessary step toward isolating a gene and determining its role in
human health.
   ``By mapping it, you can find it, isolate it, and develop new
means of therapy,'' said Dr. Frank Ruddle of Yale University, one of
the organizers of the conference.
   Such mapping helps doctors understand human genes, in much the
same way that road maps aid the understanding of places.
   People unfamiliar with New York City, for example, may not have
any idea what Forty-second Street is like until Times Square is
``mapped'' onto it. In the same way, researchers have mapped the
Down's syndrome defect to a very narrow region on human chromosome
21.
   At the Ninth International Gene Mapping Workshop two years ago in
Paris, scientists had mapped about 1,000 human genes.
   By last week, the total had climbed to about 1,550. The
announcement of 400 new ones Saturday brings the total to nearly
2,000, an increase of more than one-fourth over what it was a week
ago.
   The number of mapped genes has doubled every two years since
1973, said Ruddle. If that rate of progress continues, the entire
human complement of perhaps 50,000 to 100,000 genes should be mapped
by the end of the century.
   One example of what gene mapping can lead to is the spectacular
recent progress in understanding the most common form of muscular
dystrophy.
   Until that was done, the cause of the disease was a mystery.
Researchers mapped the gene, isolated it, and determined how it was
put together.
   That gave them a good idea of the kind of protein that might be
related to it. They searched for the protein, found it, and
determined that people with muscular dystrophy were missing a
working version of it.
   The mystery is solved, and new treatments are already being
developed as a result, said Ruddle.
   Down's syndrome, marked by low I.Q. and facial abnormalities, is
one of the most common genetic ailments. It occurs in people who
mistakenly have an extra copy of chromosome 21.
   Researchers reported Saturday that the condition is related to a
tiny portion of that chromosome that could contain no more than a
few thousand genes, probably fewer.
   They can now begin to search that region for the precise genes
responsible for the condition.
   The work that led to the mapping of Down's syndrome to that tiny
region was done mostly by Dr. Pierre-Marie Sinet of the Necker
Hospital for Sick Children in Paris and Dr. Julie Korenberg of the
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
   Researchers have also determined that one uncommon form of
Alzheimer's disease is related to a defect on chromosome 21. They
reported at the workshop that they have narrowed the location to one
of two small regions on the chromosome.
   Studies of six individuals with unusual abnormalities on
chromosome 21 should soon show which of those regions is the right
one, said Ben Carritt, a geneticist with the Medical Research
Council in London.
   The form of Alzheimer's involved is one that runs in families. It
is called early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.
   Doctors do not know whether it has any connection with the much
more common form of Alzheimer's disease that does not clearly run in
families and occurs at a later age, Carritt said.

<TEXT>
   Millionaire businessman Holmes
Tuttle, a staunch Republican and confidant of presidents Reagan and
Eisenhower, has died after a brief illness. He was 83.
   Tuttle had been admitted to Cottage Hospital after suffering a
stroke eight weeks earlier, said Joseph J. Keon, his son-in-law. He
died Friday in the hospital, a nursing supervisor said.
   He was born on an Oklahoma ranch, moved to California at age 17
and made his fortune in banking and car dealerships in California
and Arizona.
   Tuttle, a one-time golfing partner of former President
Eisenhower, was a member of a group of wealthy industrialists and
friends of Ronald Reagan who helped him win the governorship of
California in 1966.
   Tuttle was a major financial supporter of state GOP politicians,
Keon said, and served with steel magnate Earle Jorgenson and
corporate executive Justin Dart as Reagan's unofficial advisers.
   He met Reagan in 1946 when he sold him a Ford coupe. At the time,
Reagan was married to Jane Wyman, who knew some of Tuttle's friends.
   Tuttle said he asked Reagan to enter the California gubernatorial
race after Reagan made speeches on behalf of Barry Goldwater in the
1964 presidential campaign.
   More recently, Tuttle and other friends of the former president
purchased a $2.5 million home in Bel Air that the Reagans moved into
after leaving the White House.
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia; a son, Robert Tuttle; and a
daughter, Sally Keon.

<HEAD>Dukakis Proposes Deportation for Illegal Immigrants in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis has proposed deporting the
illegal aliens now in Massachusetts prisons as a measure to relieve
overcrowding while saving money.
   ``If we can deport them, we're going to deport them,'' Dukakis
said Friday. ``I don't see any reason why the people of this state
ought to be supporting folks who are here illegally in the first
place.''
   State Secretary of Human Services Philip Johnston, who oversees
the state corrections system, said, ``We want to try to deport as
many of these people as possible. We'll even pay their airfare.''
   State prisons and county jails are overflowing with nearly 13,000
inmates in facilities designed to hold 7,100. Inmates are doubling
and even tripling up in cells and are even sleeping in hallways,
boiler rooms and recreation rooms.
   INS Boston district director Charles Cobb welcomed Dukakis'
interest in deporting illegal aliens and said the U.S. government
can pay their outbound plane fare. ``We have money to move people,''
Cobb said.
   In the past, the INS waited for jailed illegal immigrants to
complete their sentences before starting the deportation process.
But in January, they stopped waiting and now proceed with the hope
that inmates can be deported when they get out of prison.
   Immigrants comprise 10 percent of the state's criminal inmate
population, and as many as 80 percent of them could be deported for
being in this country illegally, according to estimates from the
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``The governor and I both view this as a top priority,'' Johnston
said. ``We want to move quickly to work with INS to deport as many
people as possible, consistent with public safety.''
   He also noted the potential cost saving. The state spends about
$30,000 to house each inmate; creating a new prison bed costs
$100,000.
   If illegal aliens are deported, Johnston said, ``we can save
ourselves two or three New Braintrees,'' referring to the
controversial 500-bed prison planned for that town.

   ``Beware: Guard Duck on Duty,'' reads a
sign at the Minnehaha Grocery Store gasoline pumps.
   Minnie, named after the store, happened along on June 6, strutted
back and forth near the pumps for a while, then took up her post
between two pumps. She's been there almost every day since.
   At first, store employees didn't feed the muscovy duck because
they wanted her to stay independent. They'd take her to a nearby
pond, hoping she'd make her home there, but she insisted on flying
or walking back.
   A few days ago, a customer with two bird dogs in the back of his
truck drove up, and Minnie fled into the highway. She ducked beneath
a passing car, suffered only an injured leg and is pack at her post.
   Store owner Mel Hjelm was perplexed by the duck's affinity for
the store, but his friend Cindy Lynberg has a theory.
   ``I think she sees herself in her reflection in the gas pumps,''
Lynberg said. ``I think she thinks it's another duck.
   ``I think she's in love with herself.''

   You might think that Carolyn Lambiasi is a

   You might wonder how her mother handles a little girl who knows
how to do jump sidekicks, who has three big first-place trophies at
her home in this Chicago suburb for competing in the under-16
category.
   The answer is that tae kwon do is more than a kick-punch-block
self-defense sport, according to her instructor.
   ``It's a philosophy to respect persons. It's a discipline,''
Chung Kim, 32, said.
   Kim says he won't accept students who don't willingly help with
household chores, abide by parents' decisions and diligently pursue
their studies.
   In any case, there's no need to worry that Carolyn will run

their mother, Celia, a nurse.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Forces on Saturday
rejected a role in a three-way dialogue with opposition and
government political parties on Panama's election crisis.
   The proposal was made by a delegation from the Organization of
American States, which was sent to Panama after the government
voided the May 7 presidential election.
   International observers say the opposition won the vote by a 3-1
margin.
   The opposition seeks the resignation of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, head of the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto ruler.
Noriega said in May he would not negotiate with the opposition.
   Noriega's spokesman, Renato Pereira, reiterated that stance to
reporters Saturday. He said the Defense Forces would support
negotiations between the various political parties but that it would
not take part.
   Pereira said the opposition wants ``the military to participate
in order to demand that it capitulate, but the military will not
capitulate to politicians.''
   The fate of the military and of Noriega are not subjects for
negotiation, he said.
   The opposition on Friday agreed to the OAS proposal and said it
looked forward to negotiating a transfer of power on Sept. 1, the
constitutional inauguration day.
   The government parties have said they are willing to negotiate
with the opposition but have not said if they would join a three-way
dialogue that includes the Defense Forces.
   The opposition has been seeking Noriega's ouster for more than a
year. The United States has supported the ouster effort with
economic sanctions against Panama.
   It has also indicted Noriega on drug trafficking charges.
   Noriega says the federal indictments are a part of a U.S. plan to
renege on the 1977 treaties that cede control of the Panama Canal to
Panama at the end of the century.

   Harrods made it official Saturday. Even when it's
hot outside, skimpily dressed shoppers are not welcome at the
elegant emporium.
   Britain's best-known department store defended its new ``cover up
or keep out'' order, saying shoppers should not dress like
beachgoers.
   ``When you come shopping at the best store in the world, you
should be wearing something suitable, not something more appropriate
to the beach,'' said a Harrods spokesman, speaking anonymously.
   As temperatures soared to an unseasonably hot 81 degrees,
customers wearing revealing outfits were being shown the door on the
instructions of Mohamed Al Fayed, chairman of House of Fraser, which
owns the Knightsbridge store.
   ``In the kind of temperatures we have been experiencing lately,
people have been going just too far in their skimpy shorts and
T-shirts,'' the spokesman said. ``We have always had a dress code,
but we now feel the need to redefine it. Mr. Al Fayed has made a
personal decision on this and requests customers to wear suitable
attire for the store.''
   People wearing short-shorts, tops that reveal too much, and
cut-off, tatty jeans will be kept out, the spokesman said, but
tailored or Bermuda shorts are fine _ ``very fashionable this summer
and which we sell in the store anyway.''
   Staff at all 11 entrances to Harrods are under orders to inspect
the clothing of every shopper.
   ``If a customer fails to come up to scratch, he or she would
politely but firmly be denied entry,'' the spokesman said.
   The spokesman said some customers were ``not terribly happy when
turned away, but in the main everyone has accepted the situation.''
   Music teacher John Locke, 29, was quoted in the tabloid Today as
saying he was barred from the store by a doorman. ``I was told I was
wearing football (soccer) shorts. It's an infantile policy,'' he
said.

   Led by a black nun with cancer, the
nation's Roman Catholic bishops Saturday linked arms and sang ``We
Shall Overcome'' before agreeing to seek ways to give blacks a
greater role in the church.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops also passed a
resolution urging normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam and
approved a plan for resolving disputes between bishops and
theologians.
   Tears streamed down the faces of some bishops as they listened to
Sister Thea Bowman of Canton, Miss., who pleaded for the church to
be more sensitive to the needs of black Catholics.
   The number of black Catholics in the United States has grown from
900,000 to 2 million in the past 20 years, partly helped by
immigration from Haiti and the West Indies. There are 53 million
American Catholics.
   Only 13 of the church's 300 bishops are black. In addition, there
are 1,100 predominantly black parishes in the nation, but only 75 of
the approximately 300 black priests are pastors of black churches.
   Sister Bowman, who works at the Institute of Black Studies at
Xavier University in New Orleans, said too many white priests ``work
for the people, but have not learned to share life and love. They
insulate themselves because they don't feel comfortable with black
people.''
   The bishops conference voted to refer a proposed document from
the Bishops' Committee on Black Catholics to its Administrative
Board. The document urges greater representation of blacks
throughout the church and integration of African-American cultural
symbols into local parishes and liturgies.
   In the document titled ``Here I Am, Send Me,'' the nation's 13
black prelates say the nation and church are still burdened with
racism, and there has been a serious attrition of blacks from the
church to Protestant denominations ``where they feel more at home.''
   Auxiliary Bishop Moses B. Anderson of Detroit, a black prelate,
said it is good for Catholics to hear church leaders discuss ways to
celebrate black culture.
   Auxiliary Bishop John H. Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the
black Catholics committee, said the finished document likely will be
brought before the bishops at their November meeting.
   On the Vietnam issue, the bishops approved a statement asking the
nation to begin to heal the wounds caused by the Vietnam War and
resume diplomatic relations with its former enemy.
   ``The United States government ... must move beyond hostility and
adopt a traditional American response to the needs of desperate and
hungry people,'' the bishops said.
   The committee, which visited Vietnam in January, said the call to
normalize relations does not indicate approval of the communist
regime, but could serve as a means to provide humanitarian
assistance and more effectively lobby for improvements in human
rights and religious liberty for the Vietnamese.
   Bishop Joseph J. Madera of Fresno, Calif., who said the brother
of a priest in his diocese is one of 10 imprisoned priests in
Vietnam, expressed concerns that the church would be granting
legitimacy to a ``barbaric'' regime.
   In other business, the bishops voted 214-9 to approve a document
on ``Doctrinal Responsibilities'' recommending ways for bishops and
theologians to resolve disputes through dialogues.
   The document, first presented before the bishops' conference in
November 1987, drew initial criticism for appearing to place bishops
and theologians on an equal level.
   But much of the criticism was deflected after the document was
changed to emphasize the bishops' role as the final arbiter of
doctrinal disputes.
   ``It's primarily a call to civility and charity. I don't feel
bound by it in any way,'' said Cardinal John O'Connor on New York.
   The bishops planned to attend Mass together Sunday and meet in
executive session at the end of their four-day meeting Monday.

   House Republican Leader Robert Michel keeps a
videotape in his office of the House proceedings on Oct. 29, 1987,
the day Speaker Jim Wright stretched the rules to snatch a rare
legislative victory from the GOP.
   Once in a while, it is brought out and replayed as a reminder of
the indignities House Republicans suffer as their 35-year minority
status continues. It is a condition that has never been as wearisome
as during Wright's tenure these past 2{ years, and Michel _ by
personality a quiet, gentlemanly legislator _ has been forced to
learn some new tactics.
   The transformation was most noticeably on display the day Wright
stepped down as speaker. Addressing the House on an occasion that
seemed made for conciliation and courtesy, Michel instead turned
critical.
   ``The distinguished members of the committee on ethics ... are
neither mindless nor cannibals,'' he said in rebuttal to Wright's
resignation speech a week before.
   ``I am all for putting an end to bitterness. I am all in favor of
putting our house in order. But we do not do so by sweeping things
under the rug.''
   He also observed that ``thirty-five years of uninterrupted power
can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and
comity. Those who have been kings of the hill for so long may forget
that majority status is not a divine right.''
   Michel's more partisan demeanor has prompted criticism from
Democrats and the attention of Republicans.
   ``It's there, and there isn't any room to argue about whether Bob
is more partisan,'' says Rep. Edward Madigan, a fellow Illinois
Republican who shares Michel's preference for reasoned discourse
over confrontation.
   While Michel said later he was simply stating ``what had to be
said,'' his remarks angered many Democrats, who saw it as kicking
Wright while he was down.
   ``What he said was beneath him,'' said Rep. David Bonior of
Michigan, No. 4 in the House Democratic leadership hierarchy. ``I
think he knows deep down it was inappropriate.''
   Michel's approach to leading his Republican cadre also has
changed for another reason: changes in the makeup of the 175-member
GOP conference itself. An influx of younger members elected since
1982 has brought a growing disaffection with compromise and a
proclivity for more rhetorical bomb-throwing.
   Many Democrats believe Michel's occasional forays into hardball
politics are a reflection of that newer group, epitomized by Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the man who contributed mightily to bringing
down Wright and who was elected the party's No. 2 leader this year.
   Michel's comments when he handed the House gavel over to new
Speaker Tom Foley ``fits right in with the markup of Gingrich's
attacks,'' Bonior said. ``It meshes comfortably with the rhetoric of
the far Republican right.''
   ``It was indicative of the embattled Bob Michel as opposed to the
one of the past, who was consensus building,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho
of California, who was No. 3 in the Democratic leadership before
giving up his House seat because of questions about a junk bond
deal. ``It was a Bob Michel who was looking behind his back. ... The
division that exists on their side is quite severe, and he senses
it, feels it and reacts to it all the time.''
   Whether things will change with the ascension of Foley remains to
be seen.
   ``I wouldn't want to predict that,'' Michel said. ``It gives us
an opportunity for a fresh start, and I'm going to try and make the
most of it.''
   Bonior was less sanguine. ``This kind of internecine warfare
could continue to go on for the rest of this Congress,'' he said.
   ``The leader has to more or less reflect the spirit, the
attitudes, the values of his troops,'' said Republican Rep. Henry
Hyde, another Illinoisan. ``We saw Jim Wright move to the left as he
ascended the ladder of leadership. Tom Foley has done the same. And
the Republicans have become more militant in the past four years
because of abuses of power by the Democrats.''
   Foley, in an interview last week after his election to the
speakership, acknowledged _ without naming Wright _ that Democrats
had at times overplayed their majority privileges.
   He singled out the 1987 vote on a budget bill, when Wright
created two legislative days out of one and held open a roll-call
long enough for one Democrat to change his vote and provide the
winning margin. ``I think we went too far on that day,'' he said,
and promised an end to such overreaching.
   The deterioration of House comity dates to 1985, when Democrats
denied a House seat to Republican Richard McIntyre of Indiana in a
disputed close election. The 1987 budget vote added fuel to the
fire, as did later clashes over aid to the Nicaraguan contras and
Wright's alleged disclosure of a CIA covert operation in Nicaragua.
   In the latter case, Michel shocked some Republicans by joining
Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., in filing a formal ethics complaint
against Wright.
   On Contra aid, Michel felt he had been cheated out of the right
in March 1988 to a vote on a GOP alternative. ``We were promised a
fair shot at a substitute. We got a shot all right, a shot in the
head,'' he said. In a statement, he later added: ``In over 30 years
as a member of this institution, I have kept my word. I expect
others to do the same.''
   ``If Wright had treated Republicans more evenhandedly, like
(former speakers) Carl Albert or Tip O'Neill, you would not see this
significant change in Bob Michel's behavior,'' Madigan said.

   A second occupant of the plane was hospitalized in serious
condition, according to police spokesman Dirk IJzerman. No further
injuries were reported, he said.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known, IJzerman said.
   The accident occurred at a recreational area near Hoofddorp. The

   Sen. Pete Wilson said Saturday that maintaining
business-as-usual with China's repressive regime is ``intolerable''
and called for revocation of that country's favored trading status
with the United States.
   ``The United States must be a moral leader,'' the California
Republican said in an appearance on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday.
``... I think we've got to do that with some concrete, tangible
means.''
   He expressed dismay at President Bush's reluctance to go beyond a
cutoff of military sales in protesting the Beijing government's
crackdown on pro-democracy students and other dissidents.
   Wilson said he will offer a nonbinding resolution on Monday
calling for revocation of China's most-favored-nation trading status.
   Trading partners with that status are guaranteed trade relations
with the United States that are as favorable as any those of any
other nation.
   Although such a resolution is non-binding, Wilson said it is
important to put Congress on record against the Chinese regime's
bloody repression of the pro-democracy movement, its massacre of
peaceful demonstrators near Tiananmen Square and its continued
campaign to arrest and denounce the dissidents.
   ``The United States is the largest direct investor in the
People's Republic of China,'' Wilson said. ``The hope is ... that a
more moderate leadership takes over, but one can assist that to come
about.''
   He said the United States brought trade pressures against the
Soviet Union to press for human rights reforms and should do so with
China.
   Wilson complained about reports that business representatives,
particularly from Japan, are returning to China in spite of the
crackdown.
   ``Business as usual _ it's intolerable,'' Wilson said. ``It ought
to be condemned.''
   But a former ambassador to China, Winston Lord, echoed Bush in
saying that trade trade sanctions often ``hurt the people'' instead
of the government.
   Calling the question one over which ``reasonable people can
disagree,'' Lord said on the same program that it would not be in
America's best interest ``to dismantle accords, legislation and
blueprints (of an economic relationship) that have taken years to
build.''
   Lord argued that ultimately, the aged Chinese leaders now in
charge of the repression will pass away and the United States will
want to maintain its economic and trade ties for that moment.
   The former ambassador, who was in China in February when Bush
visited Beijing, applauded the president's approach and said the
administration's ``rhetoric should continue to be strong.''

   Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and killed a
15-year-old Palestinian and wounded 15 Arabs in clashes that broke
out Saturday during a Palestinian strike to protest Israel's Middle
East peace plan.
   Also Saturday, troops burned uniforms belonging to PLO militants
that had been stored in an Islamic shrine. They also torched several
copies of the Koran, the holy book of Moslems, according to Arab
reports.
   Arab reports said the strike was observed in the seaside Gaza
Strip, where troops on Friday shot and killed three Palestinians.
   New confrontations were reported Saturday, and officials at Gaza
City's Shifa hospital said they treated eight wounded, including
three teen-agers, from the Shati refugee camp, the village of Beit
Hanoun and Gaza City.
   In the Khan Yunis refugee camp, soldiers shot Akram Mohammed
Schade Saada in the neck and he later died at the nearby Nasser
Hospital, hospital officials and Israel radio reported. The military
command said it was checking the report.
   The army immediately imposed a curfew on the camp, forcing its
35,000 residents to stay indoors, Arab reports said.
   Saada was the fourth Palestinian killed in Gaza in two days; 521
Arabs have been killed since December 1987, when the uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank began.
Twenty-two Israelis also have died.
   In the West Bank, merchants also shuttered their stores and
transport was grounded, Arab reports said.
   Seven Palestinians were wounded in scattered clashes in the West
Bank, including a 13-year-old boy shot in the leg during an army
raid on the village of Burin, hospital officials said. The army
confirmed one wounded.
   According to Arab accounts, the army raided the West Bank
villages of Osarin and Hawara, and about two dozen residents were
reported beaten with assault rifles.
   During a raid on Kafr ed-Dik soldiers uncovered a cache of
uniforms belonging to activists of the Palestinian Popular Army, an
umbrella group of uprising leaders usually linked to the PLO.
   The uniforms were hidden in a ``makam Islami'' or an Islamic
shrine, and soldiers torched them together with several copies of
the Koran, Arab reports said. The army command said it would look
into the reports.
   Saturday's general strike was called by the PLO-led underground
leaders of the uprising to protest Israel's Middle East peace plan
and press demands for an international peace conference.
   The peace initiative, put forward by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, calls for Palestinian elections in the occupied territories
to choose non-PLO representatives, who would negotiate temporary
self-rule with Israel.
   In a leaflet, activists called the plan a conspiracy and said the
strike was to ``call on the American administration to hold an
international conference, as it is the only way to reach peace in
the region.''
   Shamir is a staunch opponent of an international conference,
saying Israel might be forced to make territorial concessions.
   On Friday, the eve of the strike, violent clashes broke out in
the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, where soldiers killed three. The city
was placed under an indefinite curfew, forcing more than 50,000
Arabs to stay inside their homes.
   The head of the army's southern command, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak
Mordechai, visited Rafah on Saturday to question troops about the
clashes. The army said an initial investigation showed that soldiers
acted after they were attacked by Palestinians who hurled rocks and
metal bars.

   As sales of Washington apples hit their
lowest point of an Alar-plagued year, some growers are considering
giving away fruit to the poor as a way to reduce supplies and raise
prices.
   One proposal includes taking a truckload of Washington apples to
New York City and giving them away to show how desperate the
situation is, said Jim Clements of Selah, president of the
Washington Association of Apple Growers.
   ``The financial carnage taking place now is beyond what the
consumer can understand,'' Clements said Friday.
   The drop in sales and prices was triggered when a private
consumer group issued a report in February contending that eating
Alar-treated apples increased cancer risk in children.
   About the same time, the federal Environmental Protection Agency
said that it was considering banning the chemical starting next year
because of a slight risk, but that the risk was not enough to
warrant emergency action or consumer concern.
   Alar spurs even growth in apples, improves their appearance and
gives them longer shelf life. Its use has dropped steadily in recent
years as questions have been raised about its safety, and after the
most recent publicity, its maker said it would be taken off the U.S.
market.
   Meanwhile, the apple growers association is running an
advertisement in papers Sunday asking growers if they are interested
in diverting all or part of their apples away from the marketplace
as a way to raise wholesale prices to the break-even point.
   Clements said the apples could be given to poor people, churches
or social service organizations, rather than sold at a loss to
retailers who Clements contends are making large profits at the
expense of growers.
   Growers accuse retailers of failing to cut supermarket prices in
the wake of the plunging wholesale apple prices, thus holding down
consumer sales.
   ``It's flat crazy,'' said grower Rob Valicoff, saying that
everyone but growers are making a profit off the crop.
   Retailers should be reducing their prices to sell more apples as
a sign of support for the battered growers, they contend.
   The ad also asks growers if they are interested in pledging
financial support to explore a lawsuit against those who helped
trigger the Alar controversy. That would include the Natural
Resources Defense Council, which issued the disputed report, and the
CBS television program ``60 Minutes,'' which gave the report what
growers feel was unbalanced publicity.
   The association, which has 300 grower-members, is asking for
mailed responses to gauge the mood of the state's 5,000 growers, and
has not decided on any course of action, Clements said.
   But the proposed actions are an indication of the desperation in
this region that produces half the nation's apples.
   Sales last week plunged to their lowest point of the year and
prices sank further below the cost of production, adding to the
previous estimates of $100 million in losses for apple growers
nationally as a result of the Alar scare.
   Out-of-state shipments fell to 843,000 boxes, 15 percent less
than the week before and 32 percent less than for the same period
last year, according to the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association.
   Wholesale prices dropped to $8 or less per 42-pound box for the
top grade of Red Delicious apples, up to $4 less than last year and
at least $2 below the cost of production, according to Market News
Service.

   Syrian gunners fired 150 howitzer shells
into the three main ports north of Beirut on Saturday and clashed
with Christian forces along Beirut's dividing Green Line. Police
said one civilian died.
   There were no casualties in the barrage on the Jounieh, Tabarja
and Byblos ports through which food, fuel and occasionally weapons
are smuggled into the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, police said.
   In Christian East Beirut, a man was killed by sniper fire, they
said.
   That brought the toll to 373 people killed and 1,450 wounded
since clashes broke out March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly
Christian troops and the allied Syrian and Lebanese Druse forces.
   Last week, Syrian gunners attacked an oil tanker and three boats
carrying food and gasoline to the Christian enclave. In response,
Aoun said Friday he would attack the network of roads along which
the Syrians bring in supplies from Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   Aoun did not say how he would carry out attacks on the roads,
which would be a dramatic escalation of the 3-month-old
confrontation.
   Meanwhile, newspapers in Lebanon on Saturday warned of an
escalation in fighting, which began when Aoun blockaded illegal
militia-run ports that he said deprived the state treasury of $100
million yearly. The Syrians responded by blockading the Christian
enclave.
   ``If the trends of escalation and tension persist in Lebanon,
they would lead to a renewed outbreak of war at a large scale,'' the
daily An-Nahar quoted an unidentified U.S. diplomatic source as
saying.
   Syrian troops entered Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate one year after the countri's civil war began.
They later sided with the Moslems.

   Thunderstorms and showers that fell Saturday across the
Southeast, and storms in the Midwest grew stronger.
   Eastern Virginia, the Carolinas, central and southern Georgia and
the Florida panhandle got rain Saturday, the day after strong storms
moved through much of the eastern part of the nation.
   Intensifying thunderstorms in the Midwest brought showers from
North Dakota and South Dakota into western Minnesota, Nebraska,
eastern Kansas, western Missouri and north-central Oklahoma.
   Thunderstorms also were scattered over Lower Michigan, northern
Indiana, northern Ohio and western New York.
   Rain extended along the northern Pacific coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 2
inches at Panama City, Fla., almost an inch at Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
three-quarters of an inch at Jacksonville, N.C., and two-thirds of
an inch at Wilmington, N.C.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Traverse City, Mich., to 107 degrees at Phoenix. The
nation's low temperature Saturday morning was 31 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo.
   The national weather forecast for Sunday was for showers and
thunderstorms from southern Wisconsin across Illinois, eastern
Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, southwest Lower Michigan, Ohio and West
Virginia. Scattered showers were predicted for northern and central
New England and northeastern New York state.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s in much of New
England, inland New York state, Pennsylvania, Ohio, the Great Lakes,
Indiana, Wisconsin, eastern Iowa, Minnesota, from central Montana
across the northern Pacific Coast and scattered along the California
coast. Highs should be in the 90s in much of Florida, and to near
100 degrees in Texas, New Mexico and the Great Basin of Nevada and
western Utah. Highs in the 90s to near 115 degrees were expected in
inland valleys of central California and through the desert
Southwest. High temperatures in the remainder of the nation
generally were expected to be in the 80s.

<TEXT>
   Assault rifles, fetal tissue transplants and
mandatory employee health insurance will be among the topics debated
this week at the American Medical Association's annual policymaking
convention.
   Other items on the agenda for the AMA's House of Delegates
meeting include whether life support should be withheld for
vegetative patients, required cholesterol and sodium content labels
on food products, random drug testing of athletes, and numerous
resolutions on how to battle AIDS.
   The 433 delegates, representing state medical associations,
physicians, medical students and hospital medical staffs nationwide,
act as a legislature for the nearly 300,000-member association,
setting policy for the nation's largest doctors' group. The five-day
meeting begins Sunday.
   Delegates will receive nearly 300 reports and proposed
resolutions on topics ranging from fraud in scientific research to
the hazards of wearing portable radios.
   The House of Delegates will vote during the convention on whether
to adopt the proposals as official AMA policy.
   The association's board of trustees, its governing body, is
recommending that state medical associations lobby for increasing
legal alternatives for medically incompetent patients on life
support systems.
   The trustees recommend encouraging legislatures in the 40 states
without a ``durable power of attorney health care statute'' to enact
the measure, which allows people to authorize others to take legally
binding action on their behalf _ including removing life support.
   The trustees also recommend that ``physicians encourage their
patients to document their wishes regarding the use of
life-prolonging medical treatments.''
   A joint report from the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs and
Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs encourages continued federal
funding for fetal tissue transplants, which they say have led to
significant medical advances.
   The councils address opposition from abortion opponents who fear
the possibility that a woman's decision to have an abortion will
become coupled with a decision to donate fetal tissue.
   ``Safeguards to reduce any motivation, reason or incentive by the
woman to have an abortion can be developed,'' they wrote.
   Delegates from Michigan have proposed the AMA seek legislation
banning the sale or ownership of assault rifles.
   ``A major purpose of assault rifles is to kill people,'' their
resolution says. ``The medical profession has an obligation to
promote programs and attitudes to safeguard the health and
well-being of the community.''
   The trustees recommend that the AMA endorse a plan that would
require businesses to provide health insurance coverage for all
employees.
   The proposal would begin with larger employers, and be phased in
to include smaller ones. It would also establish a program of
diminishing tax credits ``or other incentives to avoid adverse
effects on employers.''
   Other recommendations include:
   _Routine AIDS testing of newborns in areas where the disease is
prevalent.
   _Recording tobacco use on death certificates.
   _Removing provisions in child abuse laws that allow parents to
withhold proper medical attention from their children on religious
grounds.
   _Making possession of steroids for other than medical purposes a
felony.
   _Discouraging the use of infant walkers, which critics link to
thousands of injuries each year.
   _Allowing physicians who treat the indigent to have income tax
deductions.

   Authorities ended their search of a remote
Hawaii Island valley after finding the bodies of all but one of the
11 people killed when a sightseeing plane crashed.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane slammed into an 1,800-foot
cliff on June 11, killing all 11 people aboard.
   The bodies of two or three victims were discovered Friday, and
seven sets of remains were found Tuesday.
   Rain and fog in the rugged Waipio Valley forced authorities to

Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.
   ``The weather conditions have turned bad again and we just have

<HEAD>Smoke Jumpers Gather for Reunion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smoke jumpers from across the country dropped
in for the weekend in Boise to mark their occupation's 50th
anniversary.
   ``For a lot of us, it's still in our blood,'' said reunion
organizer and former smoke jumper Les Tschohl. He estimated that
1,000 current and former smoke jumpers would attend the reunion,
which started Friday.
   There are only 400 active smoke jumpers in the nation, Tschohl
said. All must first be firefighters and go through an intensive
four weeks of training before they are used to fight forest fires.
   Once on the ground, their main tool is a shovel. A typical smoke
jumper's fire is a single tree ablaze. Last year, they stopped
hundreds of lightning strikes from becoming infernos in the
backcountry.
   ``Smoke jumpers are designed for rapid initial attack,'' Tschohl
said.
   Earl Cooley, 77, who made the first jump into a forest fire on
July 12, 1940, the summer after the smoke jumping technique was
developed, said parachuting never scared him. Even so, he said, ``It
just isn't natural to stick your head out the door and jump into
open space.''
   Mark Klinger, a current smoke jumped, said advances in the
quality of parachutes have made the job safer and easier.
   Tschohl said, however, that smoke jumpers are tradition-bound,
and still sew their own jumping clothes and parachutes.
   ``I got pretty good on the sewing machine after a while,''
Tschohl said, adding that he knows one smoke jumper who makes
dresses for his wife.

<TEXT>
   Iran hanged two would-be saboteurs and 15
drug traffickers Saturday, and officials arrested 11 other suspected
drug smugglers in the past week, Tehran television reported.
   The 17 executions were the first reported since the country's
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, died June 3.
   The television broadcast, monitored in Cyprus, said the 15 drug
traffickers were convicted of smuggling and distributing more than
880 pounds of illegal narcotics. It said they were sentenced by
Islamic courts and hanged in western Bakhtaran province.
   It reported the two men convicted of attempted sabotage were
executed in Zahedan, the capital of southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan
province, and identified them as Piri Qanbarzehi and Abdolghani
Rakhshani. The report did not give their ages or further information
about them.
   It said both were charged with the illegal possession of weapons
and explosives and of ``plotting against national security.''
   The broadcast did not mention any act of sabotage.
   In another report from Zahedan the television report said 11
suspected drug smuggler were arrested and 1,851 pounds of narcotics
confiscated in three raids. It said police seized 66 pounds of
heroin and t1,785 pounds of opium.
   A law that went into effect last January mandates the death
penalty for anyone found in the possession of even small quantities
of drugs. Hundreds have since been executed for drug offenses.
   Most traffickers have been arrested in Sistan-Baluchestan or
northeastern Khorasan province on the borders with Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
   The U.S. State Department and some humanitarian organizations,
including London-based Amnesty International, have criticized Iran
for a large number of executions.
   Reports have said many of those executed were political prisoners
opposed to Iran's fundamentalist Islamic rule.

<HEAD>Police Confirm Reputed Crime Boss A Homicide Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The positive identification Saturday of
the body of a reputed New England mob boss has alerted federal
authorities to the possibility of an underworld power struggle.
   The death of William P. Grasso, 62, was ruled a homicide after an
autopsy showed that the New Haven man died of a single gunshot wound
to the neck, authorities said.
   Two fishermen found Grasso's body Friday in woods along the shore
of the Connecticut River in Wethersfield, just south of Hartford.
The body was partly submerged.
   It was unclear when the shooting occurred, how long the body had
been lying by the river or how it got there, said Sgt. Scott O'Mara
of the state police.
   Grasso was identified by the FBI last year as a top-ranking
member of the Patriarca crime family, based in Providence, R.I.,
which is said to control illegal gambling, loan-sharking and other
rackets in Hartford, New Haven, Boston, Providence, Worcester,
Mass., and many smaller cities and towns in an area stretching from
Connecticut to Maine.
   Grasso was the ``single most influential organized crime figure
in Connecticut,'' and ``one of the top two if not the top in New
England,'' said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy.
   ``It's a very nasty business Mr. Grasso allegedly was in.
Usually, we have to sit back and see what something like this shakes
loose,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney John Durham, who heads the
Organized Crime Strike Force in Connecticut.
   Twardy said the primary concern of federal agents is to determine
``what led to this murder'' and whether it was an ``internally
sanctioned hit or an unsanctioned hit.
   ``If this is an internally sanctioned hit involving the Patriarca
family, then that would probably be the end of it,'' Twardy said.
``But if it is an unsanctioned hit, a feud between families, there
promise to be further hits down the road.''
   The U.S. attorney said the FBI is investigating whether there is
a connection between Grasso's death and the wounding Friday outside
Boston of another reputed Patriarca leader. Francis P. Salemme, 56,
was the target of an attack by four men firing assault rifles,
authorities said.
   According to published reports in Boston and Providence, which
quoted unidentified law officers, Salemme was an heir-apparent in
the Patriarca family.
   The Boston Globe on Saturday quoted unnamed sources as saying
Grasso's death could signal a war between the Patriarca family and
the New York-based Genovese crime family. The sources said Grasso
had been expected for some time to make a power grab in Springfield,
Mass., territory now controlled by the Genovese family.
   Known for keeping an extremely low profile, Grasso gained
underworld prominence in 1984 upon the death of Raymond L.
Patriarca, who had run his organization from a vending machine
company office in Providence for 25 years. Grasso assumed a
high-echelon position under Ray Patriarca Jr., Providence police
were quoted as saying at the time.
   Federal officials said that in recent years the younger Patriarca
has seemed more interested in developing land in northern Rhode
Island than in the business of the crime family.
   The Providence-Journal on Saturday quoted an unidentified law
enforcement source as saying the shootings may indicate that someone
in New England is displeased with Patriarca's low-key leadership.
   In the late 1970s, Grasso was the target of state and federal
investigations, including a grand jury probe of allegations he
controlled illegal gambling in New Haven. The investigations never
led to his arrest.
   More recently, investigators had focused on Grasso because of the
disappearance in March 1988 of an East Hartford restaurateur who
allegedly had run afoul of the New York mob, and the slaying in
December 1988 of Eric Miller, a professional boxer from Hartford,
according to published reports.

<TEXT>
   Prize-winning New York Times correspondent
Charles Mohr, who circled the globe and covered Washington's
corridors of power in a career spanning nearly 40 years, died Friday
in a suburban hospital. He was 60.
   Mohr, who had a history of heart problems and diabetes, had
suffered a heart attack in his Chevy Chase, Md., home earlier, his
family said.
   As a Vietnam War correspondent in the 1960s, initially for Time
magazine and later for The Times, Mohr produced stories detailing in
graphic and moving terms the life of embattled troops in remote
jungle outposts.
   His work was marked by dogged pursuit of facts that went beyond
what spokesmen provided at official press briefings.
   His career also took him to India, Africa and Asia and to the
presidential campaign trail as well as the White House during the
terms of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and
Jimmy Carter.
   He was among eight reporters and editors who won the 1986
Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism for The Times for a series
on the Star Wars space-based missile system.
   Mohr, a native of Loup City, Neb., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
the University of Nebraska in 1951. He was a reporter for The
Lincoln Star in 1950 and 1951.
   He spent three years in the Chicago bureau of United Press before
joining Time in 1954. His assignments for the magazine included San
Francisco, the White House, New Delhi, Hong Kong and Saigon.
   He joined The Times in 1964 and covered the presidential
campaigns of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Jimmy Carter 1976, reported
from Africa for five years in the 1970s and covered conflicts in the
Mideast including the Yom Kippur and Six Day Wars.

   American opinion of China soured dramatically
after the regime's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators,
but Americans strongly support President Bush's restrained response,
a poll concludes.
   Seventy-eight percent of Americans surveyed had an unfavorable
opinion of China, a reversal from March when 72 percent of
respondents had a favorable opinion, according to a Los Angeles
Times poll published in early Sunday editions.
   Of the 1,417 adults surveyed nationwide, 12 percent considered
China a safe place for Americans to invest money, and only 9 percent
regard the country as a safe place for American tourists.
   But Americans supported Bush's response to the massacre in
Tiananmen Square and the hardline leadership's suppression of the
pro-democracy movement, according to the poll.
   Three-fourths of those surveyed approved of Bush's decision to
halt U.S. military sales to China and to suspend visits between the
nation's military leaders, the poll shows.
   The telephone poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, had a
margin of error of three percentage points either way.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of soldiers in scarlet tunics and bearskin
hats trooped in precise formation before Queen Elizabeth II on
Saturday for her official birthday celebration.
   The royal family was out in strength for the Trooping the Color
ceremony. The queen mother turned 63 on April 21, but the official
celebration is set on a day in June because the weather is likely to
be better.
   Spectators lined the way as horse-drawn carriages bearing the
queen and family members made their way slowly down the broad Mall
that leads from Buckingham Palace toward the the graveled open space
of the Horse Guards Parade for the big event.
   To the cadence of military bands, rank after rank of footsoldiers
marched along the avenue and hundreds of cavalrymen in plumed
helmets and chrome-plated breastplates rode by on gleaming horses,
spurs jangling and swords glinting in the sun.
   One coach carried the Queen Mother Elizabeth, the Princess of
Wales and her two sons, Prince William, nearly 7, who is second in
line to the throne after his father Prince Charles, and Prince
Harry, who will be 5 in September.
   It was Harry's first year in the parade and although he is no
stranger to royal pomp, he seemed just as awed by it all as the
spectators. While William waved he sat quite still watching the
cheering crowds
   Charles and his father, Prince Philip, rode horseback, as did the
queen's cousin the Duke of Kent _ all in the scarlet uniforms of the
prestigious Guards regiments that participate in the annual ceremony.
   The queen, wearing a blue and white silk dress and wide-brimmed
hat, stood on a dais at the parade ground as the 1st Battalion
Coldstream Guards trooped the color, or regimental flags, past.
   After the ceremony the queen rode back along the Mall to
Buckingham Palace, where she and members of the family made an
appearance on the balcony to watch a Royal Air Force fly-past by 11
planes, including jet fighters of the aerobatics team called the Red
Arrows.
   Harry finally waved at the crowd, smiling broadly.
   The Trooping has been a regular event since the turn of the
century, but during the 18th and 19th centuries it was an erratic
occasion, seldom, if ever, attended by the monarch.
   In 1845, Queen Victoria wrote that she drove in a ``small green
chariot,'' ``quite incog'' and had ``an admirable view of the parade
without being found out.''

   Mino Maccari, a noted artist and founder of a satire
magazine that opposed the fascism of Benito Mussolini, has died at
the age of 91, his family said Saturday.
   Maccari died late Friday at home of natural causes, they said.
   The painter and graphic artist co-founded the magazine ``Il
Selvaggio'' (The Savage) in 1924 and became its main illustrator.
   The magazine derided fascism and supported a literary and
artistic movement known as ``Strapaese,'' which emphasized Italy's
peasant tradition and rejected foreign, cosmopolitan models.
   After the magazine ceased publication in 1943, Maccari continued
to write and draw satire of Italian life, especially of the upper
classes and the powerful.
   The funeral was to be private, his family said.

<HEAD>U.N. Plan Would Send Thousands of Peacekeepers to Cambodia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Spotlight-Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of military observers would
supervise a Cambodian peace agreement under a U.N. plan that parties
to the 11-year-old war are discussing, according to a senior
diplomat.
   He said it would be one of the most expensive peacekeeping
operations undertaken by the United Nations.
   Vietnam has announced it will withdraw all of its 70,000
remaining troops from Cambodia by Sept. 30 and the diplomat said
Friday the United Nations is running short of time to formulate a
peace plan.
   There have been negotiations between the Vietnamese-installed
government of Premier Hun Sen and a fractious alliance of three
opposition groups _ the radical Khmer Rouge, non-communist forces
loyal to former Premier Son Sann and supporters of ex-head of state
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The opposition groups have been fighting a guerrilla war against
the government since Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978,
ousted the Khmer Rouge and set up another communist government.
   The Khmer Rouge gained power in the spring of 1975, defeating the
U.S.-backed government. More than a million people were killed in
purges by the Khmer Rouge and its forced evacuation of the cities to
abolish all Western influence.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in a speech last month
to the Asia Society, said U.N. officials have prepared a provisional
plan for ending the conflict and organizing a government of national
reconciliation. He said the plan has been circulated among the
warring parties, but he provided no details.
   The senior diplomat, who represents one of the nations involved
in the Cambodian entanglement, said the U.N. plan under
consideration calls for at least 2,000 U.N. military observers plus
election observers to oversee balloting for a coalition government.
The diplomat spoke with the condition he not be identified.
   He emphasized the plan is in the preliminary stage and said an
international conference to be held in Paris in August will decide
what nations would be acceptable as U.N. peacekeepers.
   Negotiations are set for July 24-25 in Paris between Hun Sen's
government and the opposition alliance.
   The diplomat said the Cambodian groups have to determine the
status of the armed resistance forces. The Khmer Rouse is the
strongest and best organized, with an estimated 30,000 combat
veterans. Sihanounk, Son Sann and Hun Sen have declared their
opposition to participation by Khmer Rouge leaders responsible for
the mass killings in the late 1970s.
   Vietnam has resisted U.N. involvement because the world body
still recognizes the regime ousted by the Vietnamese as Cambodia's
legitimate government.
   Vietnam and Cambodia have expressed a preference for India,
Poland and Canada to supervise the Vietnamese troop withdrawal.
   But the senior diplomast said he believed the United Nations
would supervise the withdrawal and the establishment of some form of
coalition government.
   He said that of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council the United States, Britain, France and China oppose the
Vietnamese-installed government and favor a strong U.N. role.
   The Soviet Union, the fifth permanent member and Vietnam's main
backer, probably would accept a U.N. peacekeeping operation and
influence Vietnam to cooperate, the diplomat said.

<HEAD>Bonuses To Rockwell Frozen Because Of Rocky Flats Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has frozen nearly $5
million in bonus payments to the operator of the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant, which is under investigation for alleged
environmental crimes.
   The bonuses were to be paid to Rockwell International Corp. for
its management of the plant, which manufactures plutonium triggers
for nuclear bombs. The payments were to cover work performed between
September 1988 and March 1989.
   The bonuses have been ``frozen indefinitely,'' said W. Henson
Moore, Energy Department Deputy Director.
   Scores of FBI agents and Environmental Protection Agency
investigators raided the plant June 6 looking for evidence of
illegal dumping and incineration of hazardous wastes. The
investigation is continuing.
   ``They're not going to get that money until we know more,'' about
the alleged misdeeds, Moore said Friday.
   Ed Heintz, Rocky Flats spokesman for Rockwell, learned of the
bonus freeze Friday night from a Denver Post reporter, the newspaper
said.
   ``I'm just amazed,'' Heintz said. ``As far as we can tell,
Rockwell is not aware of that action.''
   The DOE has warned Rockwell that any violations of environmental
laws at the plant will be considered a breach of its five-year, $2.5
billion contract.
   In a June 15 letter to Rockwell Chairman Donald Beall, Energy
Secretary James Watkins said that if ``any instances of intentional
(waste) discharges either in excess of, or not sanctioned by,
applicable environmental permits or compliance agreements were to
occur, we should both consider that wholly inconsistent with the
obligations placed on Rockwell by its contract,'' Watkins wrote.
   Watkins gave Rockwell 60 days to present him with a
``comprehensive plan that will indicate ... how Rockwell will
provide a satisfactory level of assurance that management
shortcomings ... will not occur.''

   It said the medicines and surgical equipment will be shipped to
other Asian countries where Medecins sans Frontiers teams are
working.
   The statement said those who donated funds specifically for use
in China could get their money back if they asked. The organization
began its ``Plane of Life'' program 10 days ago, appealing for help
for ``the victims of repression in China.''
   A chartered plane with 24 tons of supplies went to Hong Kong and
more than 17 tons was flown to Beijing.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of pro-independence
demonstrators waving Puerto Rican flags and chanting ``Yankee go
home'' marched Saturday during congressional hearings on the
island's political relationship with the United States.
   Protesters burned a U.S. flag and tore up another outside the
government hall in Old San Juan, where the hearing was under way.
   The demonstration generally was peaceful and there were no
arrests.
   Organizers said 80,000 people took part in the march and rally.
Police gave no estimate of the crowd and San Juan's Channel 4
Television said at least 12,000 people were marching at the outset.
   The march at one stage stretched 1.5 miles along Ponce de Leon
Avenue to Old San Juan.
   ``This is an outcry of the people against colonialism in Puerto
Rico,'' Independence Party leader Ruben Berrios told the crowd.
   Berrios said Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D.-La., who was presiding
over the three-day hearings, ``is treating Puerto Rico as a colony.''
   Sens. Johnston, James McClure, R-Idaho, and Patrick Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y., are listening to pro-independence, pro-statehood
and pro-autonomy Commonwealth leaders testify on the three options,
to be put before voters in a 1991 plebiscite.
   Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island 1,000 miles south of Miami, has
been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Most of its 3.2 million
residents speak Spanish.
   The march was one of the largest independence rallies in Puerto
Rico since U.S. forces occupied the island in 1898 after the
Spanish-American War.
   As participants passed by a small U.S. Naval Reserve base on
Ponce de Leon Avenue, soldiers lowered an American flag, apparently
to avoid provoking the marchers.
   Marchers, all carrying red, white and blue Puerto Rican flags,
chanted ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Yes to the republic! No to the
colony!''
   Marchers also chanted ``Freedom for Puerto Rican political
prisoners!''
   On Thursday, Puerto Rican nationalist Juan Segarra Palmer was
sentenced to 65 years in prison and fined $500,000 by a federal
court in Hartford, Conn., for his part in the $7 million robbery
from a Wells Fargo depot there.
   The march was supported by the Socialist Party, a small, Marxist
party that supports independence.
   That party's leader, Carlos Gallisa, told the congressional
hearings Friday that if Puerto Rico becomes the 51st U.S. state, it
will turn into ``another Northern Ireland.''
   In a 1967 plebiscite on the island's status, 60.4 percent of the
voters favored the commonwealth system, 39 percent wanted statehood
and 0.6 percent were for independence.

   Rick Rapada and his 12-year-old daughter
had an early morning visitor who didn't bother to knock before
knocking down their living room wall.
   Rapada said the first sound he heard when he awoke Friday morning
was tires screeching. Moments later a 1973 Mercury Cougar, still
running, was parked in his living room with a television and some
clothes resting on the hood.
   The impact tore a refrigerator door off its hinges and knocked a
built-in dishwasher to the other side of the house. Neither Rapada
nor his daughter, Michelle, was injured.
   Jennifer Suniga, 27, lost control of her car when another vehicle
pulled in front of her, police said. Suniga told police that she hit
the brakes and careened through a fence and over 20 feet of lawn
before crashing into the home.
   Suniga, who is pregnant, was taken to a hospital for observation
but was not admitted.

<HEAD>Time Takes Case for Warner Deal to Shareholders, Puts Off Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. is asking shareholders to reject an
unwanted $10.7 billion takeover bid from Paramount Communications
Corp. and approve its decision to make an offer for its would-be
merger partner, Warner Communications Inc.
   In a letter to shareholders released Saturday, Time reiterated
the stand it took Friday. The media giant announced then it had
turned down the Paramount bid and amended the terms of its earlier
stock-swap merger agreement with Warner to include a $14 billion
tender offer for Warner at $70 a share.
   Time also said its shareholders meeting scheduled for Friday _ at
which stockholders were expected to vote on the original Time-Warner
merger proposal _would be adjourned until June 30.
   At that time, shareholders are expected to vote on the election
of directors and other business, but no matters related to the
proposed merger with Warner, Time said.
   Time told shareholders the early returns of proxies mailed in
connection with the earlier merger agreement strongly supported the
Time-Warner combination. However, many of these proxies likely were
received before Paramount announced its $175-per-share cash bid on
June 6.
   Time told shareholders Paramount's offer was ``highly conditional
and subject to many uncertainties, including obtaining the necessary
$14 billion of financing and all required regulatory approvals.''
   Time repeated its estimate that it would take as long as a year
for Paramount to win the approvals required from some 800 cable
television systems for which Time now holds franchises. That would
delay the completion of Paramount's bid and, consequently, payments
to Time shareholders for their stock.
   In the letter and an accompanying Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, Time also charged that terms of the financing for
Paramount's offer have not been determined or negotiated.
   Time officials made each of these points in statements and
interviews Friday after they announced their long-awaited response
to Paramount's bid. Paramount said Friday it expected ``the
conditions will be satisfied with reasonable promptness'' and said
it would continue to pursue Time.
   Time outlined on Friday a two-stage offer under which it would
pay $70 a share in cash for 100 million Warner shares and then
exchange $70 a share in cash and securities for the remaining 100
million shares of Warner stock.
   A merger of Time and Warner would drive up the cost of acquiring
the company. The acquisition of Warner also would increase Time's
debt load and make it less attractive to would-be bidders.
   Under the agreement announced in March, Time stockholders would
get a share in the new company, Time-Warner Inc., for each Time
share while Warner shareholders would get 0.465 of a share of the
new company for each of their Warner shares.
   Time conceded in its letter that the original Time-Warner merger
plan had accounting and financial advantages because it involved an
exchange of stock.
   But it said shareholders ultimately would benefit from the
revised agreement because the price of their Time stock would rise
after the merger, reflecting the assets and cash flow of the two
companies combined.
   Time stock slumped $9 to $162.50 a share in New York Stock
Exchange consolidated trading Friday, while Warner rose $3.62{ to
$59.25 a share and Paramount fell $1.37{ to $58.12{.
   Analysts said there was still speculation on Wall Street that the
Paramount bid might succeed and that prevented Time stock from
falling further.

   Seventeen Boy Scouts and three troop leaders who
got lost during a heavy rainstorm spent a chilly night on a mountain
ridge before they were rescued by helicopter Saturday.
   ``They're fine. A little bit cold, a little bit hungry and
water-logged, but otherwise okay,'' said Fire Department Capt.
Gardner Brown, pilot of the helicopter, which made five trips to
retrieve the troop.
   ``They were just off to the side of the trail, maybe 50 or 60
feet away, but couldn't see it because of the heavy underbrush,''
Brown said.
   Troop 199 of the Church of Latter-day Saints in Kahuku, a
community across the island of Oahu from Honolulu, began their
62-mile hike across the Koolau Mountain range on Tuesday, planning
to emerge in Kahuku on Saturday.
   The leaders radioed a distress call on a military frequency
Friday afternoon, reporting they were stranded by the weather and
out of food.
   Fire Department and Coast Guard helicopters were unable to locate
them before nightfall despite the constant radio communication.
   The search resumed Saturday and the troop was found located soon
after daylight.
   The scouts ranged in age from 13 to 17.

   Former President Ronald Reagan and singer Stevie
Wonder joined hundreds of thousands of Parisians Saturday night in
celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Eiffel Tower.
   The crowd sang ``Happy Birthday'' at the end of an 89-minute
sound, light, and fireworks spectacle _ incorporating special
effects, 100 motorcycles and 5,000 performers _ saluting the
1,000-foot structure erected in 1889.
   Reagan was the guest of Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, whose city
administration underwrote the $13.3 million cost of the production.
   Singers provided a range of styles _ from Stevie Wonder to
Placido Domingo to French rocker Johnny Halliday and crooner Charles
Trenet.
   Thousands of lights transformed the tower into a luminous
spaceship one minute or a giant brooch of glittering multicolored
jewels the next.
   The spectacle was divided into three parts _ first evoking the
French Revolution of 1789 and the century leading up to the tower's
construction, then the century from 1889 to today and finally the
century of tomorrow (1989-2089).
   Giant screens relayed the show to an estimated 500,000 people who
gathered in the Champs de Mars under the tower, on the Seine bridges
and at the Trocadero across the river.
   The tower's birthday cake measured 65 feet across and 89 feet
high.
   A television special recording the celebration, produced by Radio
City Music Hall Productions, is to be broadcast in France and at
least 18 other countries.
   This was the second celebration this year of the anniversary. On
March 31, the first ascent to the top by Gustave Eiffel and others
was re-eneacted in period dress for a smaller audience.

<HEAD>Soviet Activist Says His Country Could See Chinese-Style Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GRONINGEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet activist Andrei Sakharov
said Saturday the Kremlin could someday launch a Chinese-style
crackdown on the Soviet pro-democracy movement.
   ``I fear that in the future, something like it can happen in our
country,'' Sakharov told reporters in this northern Dutch city,
where he was awarded a honorary law degree on Friday.
   ``The political activity of the masses has increased to a very
high degree in the Soviet Union, and the political leadership is
becoming scared,'' the 68-year-old human rights activist said.
   Sakharov received the silver medal of the Dutch Academy of
Sciences in Amsterdam on Saturday.
   Sakharov said there was an ``unprecedented loss of confidence in
the political leaders'' in his country, and he called on Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to speed the pace of democratic
reforms.
   ``That is the only way to avoid a disaster. ... The country is on
the brink of catastrophe.''
   ``Nothing has been achieved during the 72 years of power monopoly
by the Communist Party which cost tens of millions of lives,'' he
said. ``There is no economic structure, no opportunity for
technological progress, and no social justice.''
   Sakharov's remarks in Russian were translated into Dutch by a
Groningen University interpreter.
   The nuclear physicist, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
1975 for his human rights efforts, called on the Soviet leadership
to support the pro-democracy movement in China.
   ``Such support would reinforce the campaign for democratic change
in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Chinese troops crushed the movement in Beijing on June 3-4.
Estimates differ on how many died. The Chinese government variously
says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed. Unofficial
Chinese and Western intelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed
crowds and killed up to 3,000.
   Gorbachev, in his most extensive comments since visiting China
last month, said this week that the Soviet leadership regretted some
aspects of the conflict in China and expressed concerns over the
future of reforms there.
   Gorbachev allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow in December 1986
after nearly seven years in exile in Gorky. Sakharov supported
Gorbachev early on but has become increasingly critical, saying that
democratic reforms are being hampered by conservatives and that
Gorbachev himself has not gone far enough.
   For instance, Sakharov was among those saying that Gorbachev's
election as president and Communist Party general secretary
concentrated too much power in one man's hands. Nevertheless,
Sakharov has returned to official good favor.
   He was given his old job back at the Academy of Sciences, where
he works as a physicist, has been quoted frequently in the official
press, spoken at officially sponsored news conferences, and been
allowed to travel to the West.
   Gorbachev has shown respect for Sakharov, but at the recent
Soviet Congress meeting, Gorbachev criticized Sakharov for saying
the session was a failure.
   Sakharov's journey to the Netherlands is his third trip abroad.
He is accompanied by his wife, Yelena Bonner.
   On Friday, he accepted an honorary law degree from the State
University in Groningen, 120 miles northeast of Amsterdam. He was
cited for his ``exceptional services to the cause of ... human
rights.''
   On Sunday, Sakharov and Ms. Bonner are to fly to London to visit
friends, said Rob Rutgers, dean of the university's law faculty.

   Eight people were sentenced to death Saturday for
allegedly beating soldiers and burning vehicles when troops took
over Tiananmen Square at the start of the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement.
   The government also said two men were captured after they fired
at soldiers guarding a bridge early Saturday. Four Western reporters
left China after being expelled for violating martial law.
   Authorities allowed civilians onto Tiananmen Square for the first
time since soldiers backed by tanks entered the plaza the night of
June 3-4 to drive out student protesters and crush their seven-week
movement for a freer society.
   About 10,000 children wearing red scarves of the Young Pioneers,
a Communist youth group, lined up on the 100-acre square in central
Beijing while group members placed a wreath of flowers at the
Heroes' Monument.
   The monument, where thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators
gathered day and night for three weeks until the army moved in, was
decorated with banners including one that read: ``Love socialism and
the mother country.''
   After the ceremony the children were trucked out of Tiananmen,
which is still blocked off by armed soldiers. Pedestrians are not
allowed inside.
   China's evening TV news on Friday showed crews disinfecting the
square, repairing the pavement and replanting bushes. The military
took selected reporters on a tour of the square Friday.
   The eight sentenced to die were the first to be condemned for
trying to stop the People's Liberation Army from moving on the
student protesters in Tiananmen, the symbolic center of China.
   The seven men and one woman were identified in an official
television report as workers, peasants and unemployed local
residents, and were shown appearing before the Beijing People's
Intermediate Court for sentencing.
   Three men in Shanghai were sentenced to death Thursday after a
court said they incited protests and set fire to a train in rioting
following the crackdown in Beijing.
   Beijing radio said 109 people in the capital had turned
themselves in since the government started rounding up leaders of
the pro-democracy movement. It also said 16 people surrendered in
Nanjing, one of the many Chinese cities where protests broke out
after the military sweep in Beijing.
   Authorities have arrested more than 1,200 people nationwide in
the last two weeks, including four on a wanted list of 21 student
leaders.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said two ``ruffians'' shot at
soldiers and injured one after troops fired warning shots and
ordered the gunmen to stop.
   The gunmen fled but were later captured and turned over to
security forces, Xinhua said. The report did not say how they
obtained the firearms.
   John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the U.S.
Government-run Voice of America, both resident correspondents in
Beijing, arrived in Hong Kong after being told Wednesday to leave
the country within 72 hours.
   They were accused of violating martial law regulations
prohibiting foreign reporters from covering the pro-democracy
movement.
   Vernon Mann and John Elphinstone, both of Britain's Independent
Television News, also took a flight to Hong Kong on Saturday after
being given 24 hours to leave China.
   Officials in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, accused
them of violating martial law while filming unrest in the
south-central city on Wednesday.
   A week ago, Peter Newport, another ITN journalist, was ordered
out of China from Shanghai, where he had scuffled with police while
filming a small student rally.
   The government issued another martial law order Saturday
directing people to turn over to public security officials all guns
or broadcasting or videotaping equipment.
   It also kept up its attacks on the Voice of America, saying the
short-wave radio network was ``perpetrating a fraud.''
   VOA ``kept spreading the rumor that the Liberation Army committed
a `blood bath' of Tiananmen Square so as to attack China,'' Xinhua
said in a commentary.
   The government says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers, were
killed in the confrontation. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed crowds and killed
up to 3,000.
   The government did not deny that people were killed ``during the
quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' Xinhua said, but
repeated earlier statements that no one was killed when troops
marched into the square.
   ``The nearly 300 people who died included officers and men of the
Liberation Army, a handful of ruffians who deserved their deaths,
and a small number of citizens who deserved their deaths,'' Xinhua
said.
   The VOA is a major source of information for millions of Chinese
seeking information other than news reported by the tightly
controlled domestic press.
   China's top trade official was quoted Saturday as urging foreign
governments to resume aid and loans to China that had been cut off
in protest of the crackdown.
   The United States has banned military sales and contracts, France
has frozen relations with China and Japan has put off new
development assistance loans.
   Aid suppliers should take a ``farsighted view'' of their economic
relations with China and not ``interfere with Chinese internal
affairs,'' Beijing radio quoted Zheng Tuobin, minister of foreign
economic relations and trade, as saying.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party hopes to recover a
shred of dignity and Solidarity another triumph in Sunday's runoff
elections for parliamentary seats undecided in the first round of
voting two weeks ago.
   In the June 4 balloting, Solidarity-backed candidates won 252 of
the 261 seats allotted to the opposition in the new National
Assembly.
   There are contests Sunday for only eight seats in the new
100-member Senate where opposition candidates were allowed to run in
all races and won 92.
   In the Sejm, the existing Parliament, opposition candidates were
allowed to run for 161 of the 460 seats and the 299 remaining seats
were set aside for candidates of the Communist Party and its allies.
   Opposition candidates won 160 seats, leaving only one open for
the runoff, but the communists and their allies won only five of the
seats allotted to them and voters will decide on the 294 other seats
in the runoff.
   To win a seat under procedures agreed to in an April agreement by
the communist government and Solidarity, a winner had to receive a
majority of the vote. The agreement, providing for Poland's freest
elections in more than four decades, also legalized the Solidarity
union movement that had been suppressed under martial law in 1981
and then outlawed.
   Solidarity has adopted a strategy of backing reform candidates in
the runoff races involving the seats set aside for the communists.
   ``We have learned the taste of victory,'' Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa told the union's National Executive Commission at a meeting
Saturday in Gdansk.
   He said of the June 4 elections: ``Society gave us more than we
wanted and now the main thing is to build the union.''
   Although nearly all of Sunday's contests involve seats reserved
for the communists and their allies, Solidarity has been campaigning
for a strong voter turnout.
   ``They will be our partners in the Sejm,'' Solidarity spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz said Friday of the communists. ``One cannot be
indifferent to what these partners will be like. It could be
worthwhile to support someone. It could be worthwhile to cross
someone out.''
   Opposition publications have listed at least 59 communist or
allied candidates considered sympathetic to Solidarity.
   Those liberal candidates could combine with Solidarity's elected
deputies to create a powerful bloc in the Sejm and work with the
union's overwhelming Senate majority.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has been trying to put the
pieces back together after the crushing defeats in the first round.
   In a speech last week he called the June 4 results a one-time
aberration attributable to Communist Party mistakes and poor
economic conditions that he said made many Poles ``pin exaggerated
hopes on the opposition.''

<TEXT>
   Charles Haughey, the great survivor of
Irish politics, said Saturday he intends to be prime minister again
despite an embarrassing setback in national elections.
   Late returns from Thursday's voting indicated that Haughey's
Fianna Fail party would return to the parliament, known as the Dail,
with fewer seats.
   ``It's quite clear that you can't impose stringent financial
policies which are unpopular and expect the people to give you the
sort of majority we were looking for,'' Haughey said.
   Haughey failed to win a majority in four previous elections,
although he twice was able to form governments with the support of
other parties. He served his first term as prime minister after
assuming leadership of the party while it was already in power.
   Haughey said, however, he did not intend to resign as leader of
the Fianna Fail party. ``We will form a government,'' he said.
   With a half-dozen seats short of a majority, Haughey must find
support among the opposition before June 26, when the Dail
reconvenes and the new prime minister will be chosen.
   Alan Dukes, conservative leader of second-place Fine Gael, said
he could not predict what would happen.
   ``Wait and see,'' Dukes said Saturday, ``because the vision we
have in the heat of the moment may not be the best in the long
term.''
   The election returns showed a shift to the left. Labor and the
Workers Party gained seats, a Social Democrat won a seat and, for
the first time, so did a member of the Green Party.
   The results prompted talk of a historic realignment of Irish
politics.
   ``We have never had an ideological base to Irish politics
before,'' said Labor leader Dick Spring. ``This election has seen a
further right-left realignment and we are going to build on that.''
   With all seats decided, Fianna Fail had won 77, a loss of 3; Fine
Gael 55, a gain of 5; Labor Party, 15, up 4; Workers Party 7, up 3;
Progressive Democrats 6, down 8; Social Democrats 1, Green Party 1,
independents and others 4.
   Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) and Fine Gael (Family of the
Irish) are both conservative economically, but Fine Gael tends to be
more liberal on social issues. The Progressive Democrats are
breakaways from Fianna Fail.
   The returns indicated that Fianna Fail was hurt by public anger
over cuts in health service, over new fishing licenses in western
Ireland and perhaps by a campaign by army wives for better pay for
soldiers.
   In the past, the 63-year-old Haughey thrived in adversity.
Appointed to his first Cabinet post in 1961, he was dropped from the
government in 1970 after being charged with smuggling arms to the
Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland.
   Acquitted in court, Haughey battled back to become minister of
health and social welfare in 1977 and prime minister in 1979. He
also was unscathed by a 1982 scandal in which his justice minister
was accused of ordering wiretaps on members of the Dail.
   Haughey had been running well in opinion polls, with a peak of 54
percent in February, but Fianna Fail pulled 44 percent in the
election, slightly up from two years ago.
   Gerry O'Sullivan of the Labor Party, who finished first in
north-central Cork, said closings of 15 hospitals were a factor in
his victory.
   ``You cannot phase out billions and billions in debt in two
years,'' he said of Haughey's budget cuts.
   The fishing license issue cost Fianna Fail a seat in west Galway,
said Dick Willis, president of the Munster Trout Angling Council.
Outraged anglers have refused to pay for the new licensing.
   Frank Durcan, an independent who opposed the licenses, fell short
in west Mayo, where Fianna Fail held its two seats.
   None of three army wives who campaigned for higher pay for their
husbands won a seat, but they made a decent showing.
   June Kiernan polled 3,207 first preference votes in Longford
-Westmeath, where 8,460 votes were required for election. Fianna
Fail lost one of its three seats in the district.
   Fianna Fail claims the mantle of forces that originally opposed
the partition of Ireland in 1921. Its nationalism has kept it in
power for most of the republic's 68-year history.

   Former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos
underwent surgery Saturday to stop a bleeding gastric ulcer, a
hospital spokesman said. He was listed in critical condition.
   Marcos, 71, was recovering in the intensive care unit of St.

Tiwanak, assistant hospital administrator.
   Marcos has been hospitalized since January and has remained on

   The Soviet Union upstaged its competitors at the
Paris Air Show with a selection of military and commercial aircraft
and a marketing style that made it clear the new priority is to make
sales, not war.
   Soviet pilots flew flamboyant aerobatic routines in jet fighters
never before seen in the West that wowed the crowds. On the ground,
industry professionals were just as impressed with the Soviets'
capitalist fervor.
   ``This air show has made me aware that they intend to
aggressively seek foreign currency through the sale of their
aircraft to the West,'' said James Roberts, deputy undersecretary of
state for aviation in the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   ``I never before considered them a competitive threat. Now I
do,'' said Roberts, who attended the 10-day show which closes Sunday.
   The Soviets even managed to turn the crash of the MiG-29 on the
show's opening day to their advantage. The pilot, Anatoly Kvochur,
became the hero of the day and the seat that allowed him to eject
safely captured industry attention as the technology of the hour.
   At the world's greatest aviation show-and-sell, the Soviets
impressed visitors with the range and sophistication of their 12
aircraft on display, including two new airliners, the latest jet
fighters and the massive AN-225 transport carrying the shuttle Buran.
   ``Clearly the Soviet aircraft industry has made enormous
strides,'' said Ian Woodward, a spokesman for British Aerospace
commercial planes. ``They've been behind but they're catching up
fast.''
   A team of seven Soviet salesmen employed by Aviaexport, the
Soviet marketing arm, worked nonstop throughout the long hot
afternoons.
   Moscow's Central Institute of Aviation Motors offered air show
participants its research services.
   Soviet aircraft components were on display in the U.S.S.R.
Pavilion, the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos peddled its launch
services and design engineers for nearly every Soviet plane
displayed were on hand to answer questions.
   Anatoly Bulanenko, deputy chief designer for the Antonov Design
Bureau, told reporters that permission had been granted for the
AN-225 to be leased or chartered to foreign clients to carry
commercial freight. The plane, which can haul up to 250 tons, will
carry space rockets for the European Space Agency next fall.
   Bulanenko acknowledged that political difficulties may arise in
arranging deals, but said ``business should come first.''
   Many industry observers predicted the Soviets will experience
some turbulence in seeking to put their planes in Western skies.
   ``They will need to convince customers that the airplanes are
reliable, have good (after-sale) support and low maintenance
costs,'' said John Hayhurst, a marketing executive for Boeing Co.,
the largest U.S. civil aircraft maker.
   Boeing's 747 would be the chief competitor for the new Soviet
jetliner Tupelov 204 now being tested. Other Soviet planes,
including the new Ilyushin-96-300, would face established
competition from McDonnell Douglas of St. Louis, Mo., and Airbus
Industrie, the European consortium.
   Edward Sluchevsky, head of Aviaexport transport sales, said his
team of late-blooming capitalists ``are not beginners, we have
traditions, we have a reputation in the limited market we have
served.''
   ``Furthermore, we are ready to include in our contracts the same
product support, the same guarantees of reliability as our Western
competitors,'' he said in an interview at the Soviet chalet where a
constant stream of curious pilots, engineers and others came to call.
   For customers, the biggest question may be the quality of Soviet
engines, reputedly inefficient and requiring frequent maintenance.
The Soviets say they can resolve the problems and even have offered
to install Western-made engines in their planes.
   In the military market, the Soviets will be vying for a piece of
a shrinking pie. Cuts in defense spending have put the crunch on
even well-established arms makers.
   Soviet officials said they hope to increase total export sales
from the $2.27 billion projected for 1989 to about $3 billion by
1995.
   U.S. aerospace exports projected for 1989 are $27.8 billion.

<TEXT>
   Astronaut S. David Griggs, who flew on the
space shuttle in 1985 and was training to pilot a mission in
November, died Saturday when the stunt plane he was flying slammed
into a field, authorities said.
   Lamar Coleman, a dispatcher for the Crittenden County Sheriff's
Department, said the crash happened just after 9 a.m. south of
Earle, which is about 20 miles west of Memphis, Tenn.
   ``I was told he was out here practicing this morning and was
going to go to an air show at Clarksville, Ark.,'' said Peter
Kerwin, an investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration who
was on the scene.
   The show was Saturday afternoon, and Griggs was flying because he
was a friend of Greg McNeely, to whom the wrecked aircraft was
registered, Kerwin said.
   An astronaut since August 1979, Griggs, 49, had been undergoing
training as pilot for shuttle flight number 33 aboard the Discovery,
scheduled for November, NASA said.
   ``Based on what we do know in our experience with shuttle crew
training, we don't see anything that would signal that we could not
continue to move toward that November launch date,'' said NASA
spokesman Jeff Carr in Houston.
   Carr said a replacement for Griggs would have to be named within
the next week or so, adding that it should not be a problem to draw
from the pool of available astronauts.
   ``We're five months out from flight,'' Carr said. ``Training
doesn't really begin until about this time.'' Three other flights,
in July, September and October, are scheduled before the November
launch.
   Griggs was flying for McNeely Charter Service, a private air
service based in Earle, according to a woman who answered the
company's phone. The woman, who declined to give her name, referred
questions to NASA.
   Griggs was piloting a World War II vintage T-6, a two-seater,
single-engine propeller aircraft used for training, said Civil Air
Patrol Lt. Jeff Crum. It crashed in a wheat field about 150 yards
away from hangars operated by charter company, which owned the
plane. Crum said the plane had been modified for air shows.
   ``Witnesses have told us the plane was doing some sort of
aerobatic maneuver,'' said Cpl. Rick Dickinson, a spokesman for the
Arkansas State Police. ``The pilot was killed on impact.''
   William H. Wooden said he was working in his yard near the air
field and heard the steady drone of the plane's engine stop, which
caught his attention. He looked up in time to see the small craft
hurtling toward the ground.
   ``He was cutting up, flying upside down and all kinds of ways,
every kind of way I've ever seen them fly those things,'' Wooden
said.
   Hoover Williams, who lives near the crash site, said the plane
had been executing rolls.
   ``Then he attempted to turn back over and he did turn over but
then he lost control, started wobbling and his right wing hit the
ground and that's what headed him out across that wheat field,''
Williams said.
   Joan Gillum, who also lives nearby, said, ``I thought he had come
too close over my house and I was frightened he was going to fall in
our house. Then I saw him when he circled around and he just went
down.''
   ``He was doing a lot of turns and a lot of slips and I was just
scared something like this was going to happen and it did,'' Ms.
Gillum said.
   Asked whether NASA placed any restrictions on what astronauts
could do in their own time, including risky activities, Carr replied:
   ``You can't lock these guys in their houses. These guys have
thousands of hours of flying experience. They take a greater risk
driving down the Gulf Freeway in Houston than by flying. There are
no restrictions on piloting.''
   Griggs flew as a mission specialist on a shuttle mission in April
1985.
   He was appointed chief of the Shuttle Training Aircraft
Operations Office in January 1976. His responsibility included
operational use of the shuttle trainer.
   Griggs was a native of Portland, Ore. He graduated from the
United States Naval Academy in 1962 and received a master's in
administration from George Washington University in 1970.
   He served in the Navy, including two combat tours in Southeast
Asia, and a stint as a Navy test pilot.
   A biography issued by NASA listed flying as one his hobbies.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Matriarch Faces Foreclosure On Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank plans to auction the home of a civil
rights movement matriarch this week unless her friends and neighbors
can raise enough money to pay off her $60,000 loan.
   Juanita Jackson Mitchell has lived in the home for 46 years. Her
brother-in-law, former U.S. Rep. Parren J. Mitchell, launched his
political career there. Such prominent Americans as Eleanor
Roosevelt and Thurgood Marshall visited to discuss civil rights
issues over dinner.
   The foreclosure is the latest in a series of setbacks for Mrs.
Mitchell since the 1984 death of her husband, Clarence M. Mitchell
Jr., the longtime Washington lobbyist for the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Mrs. Mitchell, a lawyer who fought for the integration of
swimming pools and restaurants, is bed-ridden at age 76 after a pair
of strokes and a bout with high blood pressure, a relative said.
   Last spring, her two eldest sons _ both Maryland state senators _
entered a federal prison in Pennsylvania after their convictions on
bribery charges in the Wedtech scandal and other criminal offenses.
   Relatives said defense costs depleted the family's resources, and
that Mrs. Mitchell has been unable to sell other properties she
owns. Unlike a traditional mortgage, the loan, called a trust deed,
was structured to be paid in full after 90 days.
   First American Bank of Maryland officials said they had extended
the due date six times since September 1987, and then waited another
seven months before beginning foreclosure proceedings on the
three-story house.
   Members of Baltimore's political and legal communities started
several fund-raising drives to pay off the $60,000 debt and $5,000
in interest. By Friday afternoon, they reported receiving pledges
totaling almost $20,000.
   ``This is not an attempt to save the boys,'' said the Rev. Marion
C. Bascum. ``It is an attempt to save an old woman from the public
embarrassment and the frustration of an auction bell.''

   Voters in seven nations of the European
Economic Community determine on Sunday who to send to the European
Parliament.
   The balloting takes place in Belgium, West Germany, Greece,
France, Luxembourg, Italy and Portugal.
   Official results from Thursday's balloting in the five other EEC
nations _ Ireland, Britain, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands _ are
to be reported after Sunday's round of voting ends. In all, more
than 7,000 candidates are running.
   Exit polls from the voting Thursday indicated socialists and
centrist Christian Democrats scored some gains, largely at the
expense of conservatives.
   Although it is still mainly a consultative body, the 518-member
Parliament received more powers in 1987 and could play a major role
in the trading bloc's efforts to forge a single borderless market by
late 1992.
   Because of the voting schedule and time differences in the EEC,
the final official count will not be known until sometime Monday.
   This is the schedule:
   First results, including those from Spain and the Netherlands
that voted Thursday, will be reported Sunday night after the polls
close in Italy, France, Portugal, Luxembourg, Belgium and Greece.
   About four hours later, results will be announced from West
Germany and all of Britain except Northern Ireland. The Northern
Ireland vote will be announced around noon Monday along with the
outcome in the republic of Ireland.
   The complete Danish vote will not be announced until early Monday
morning.
   Socialist deputies held 166 seats and formed the largest bloc in
the former Parliament while Christian Democrats had 112.
   There were 7,126 candidates, representing 178 political parties
in the EEC nations, in the Thursday and Sunday balloting.
   The Parliament meets one week each month in the French city of
Strasbourg.

   An elderly man killed three people, including
his sister, and began firing at police before he was shot to death,
authorities said.
   Conrad Cantrell, 67, had five loaded guns and more than 500
rounds of ammunition in his car and was firing two pistols, one in
each hand, when he was killed Friday by authorities in rural
southwestern West Virginia, said McDowell County Sheriff's Deputy
R.L. Blevins.
   Cantrell, described as an unemployed sawmill worker, allegedly
went to his sister's house Friday afternoon and shot her and her
husband to death. The victims were identified as Hershel
Picklesimer, 70, and his wife, June, 69. Mrs. Picklesimer was
Cantrell's sister.
   About 20 minutes later, Charlie Ball of Man was shot and killed
and his wife, Juanita, was seriously wounded, authorities said.
Cantrell also knew the Balls, police said.
   Mrs. Ball, 58, was in listed stable condition Saturday morning at
Man Appalachian Regional Hospital.
   After the Balls were shot, Cantrell fled and refused to pull over
when police spotted him on West Virginia 16. A roadblock was set up.
   At the roadblock, Cantrell jumped out of his car, and McDowell
County Deputy Donald Hicks ``ordered him to drop the gun and put his
hands on the dashboard,'' McDowell County Sheriff R.J. Allen said.
``When he did, Cantrell opened fire on the deputy and everything
went crazy from there.''
   Cantrell fired several times at Hicks and other officers, and
they shot back and killed him, police said.
   One officer, Chief Deputy Charles Lawson, suffered a gunshot
wound above the elbow, and the shot broke his arm. He was listed in
stable condition this morning at Humana Hospital St. Lukes in
Bluefield, a nursing supervisor said.
   Police did not know what might have brought about the shootings.

<TEXT>
   Jose Antonio Zorrilla, once head of Mexico's
Federal Security Department, was indicted for murder Saturday in the
slaying of an investigative journalist five years ago.
   Prosecutor Rafael Avanti contends Zorrilla, 47, was the
mastermind of the killing of newspaper columnist Manuel Buendia in
May 30, 1984.
   Avanti said that during the indictment proceedings in the 34th
Penal Court Judge Roberto Hernandez Martinez ordered Zorrilla held
for trial.
   In presenting the case the prosecution said Buendia was slain
because Zorrilla feared the journalist would expose links to some of
Mexico's major drug traffickers.
   At the time of the slaying Zorrilla was the chief of the Federal
Security Department, the equivalent of the FBI in the United States.
The department was dismantled in 1985 because of alleged corruption.
   Zorrilla had been arraigned Friday and told reporters after the
arraignment, ``I did not kill my friend and there is no evidence
that implicates me.'' He did not enter a plea at the indictment
hearing, Avanti said.
   If convicted of homicide, Zorrilla could be sentenced to up to 40
years in prison.
   Authorities have said Zorrilla was one of the first law
enforcement officers at the scene of the shooting of Buendia. They
also said they have in custody the gunman who shot the journalist,
but they have not identified him or given other details.
   Zorrilla said Friday he believed Buendia was killed because his
columns in the newspaper Excelsior dealt with ``very delicate
subjects.''
   Among the subjects Buendia wrote about were corruption in high
places, drug trafficking, gun smuggling and the CIA.

<HEAD>Trumka Calls on Pittston Chief to Negotiate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEG THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers President Richard
Trumka renewed his call Saturday for The Pittston Co. to help end a
coal strike that has expanded into wildcat walkouts by more than
20,000 miners in six states.
   Coal fields in the region were mostly quiet Saturday, a day when
production slacks off at most mines before they close down for
Sunday. No new walkouts were reported.
   In southern West Virginia, a labor group affiliated with the
AFL-CIO put together a truck caravan Saturday to take food to
striking miners.
   In a letter to Pittston Co. Chairman Paul Douglas, Trumka
rejected Pittston's assertion that contract talks are at an impasse.
   ``Impasse can only be reached after the parties have engaged in
full good faith negotiations that leave each side with no more
flexibility on the issues at stake. That is not the case here,''
Trumka wrote.
   ``First, Pittston has not engaged in good faith negotiations.
Secondly, the union continues to remain flexible on working out the
differences between us.''
   Pittston last week declared negotiations at an impasse, which
allowed it to implement its latest contract offer. Federal labor law
requires UMW leaders to present that offer to their membership.
   Pittston also restored benefit payments to about 1,500 retirees,
widows and disabled miners. The company had cut off those benefits
when its contract expired in February 1988.
   Trumka told Douglas the gesture was appreciated, but said it was
not enough. ``Pittston's actions are too little, too late,'' he
wrote.
   Douglas said he had not received the letter ``and nothing
(Trumka) now says can change that situation.''
   About 1,600 UMW members went on strike against the Pittston Coal
Group Inc., a subsidiary of The Pittston Co., in West Virginia and
Virginia on April 5. Other miners began unauthorized walkouts Monday
in southern West Virginia in sympathy with the Pittston strikers.
   By Saturday, the wildcat walkouts had idled about two-thirds of
West Virginia's 24,000 miners and miners in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.
   The West Virginia Labor Solidarity Committee on Saturday drove
several truckloads of food from Charleston to strikers in Logan and
Beckley. The 50 committee members in the caravan also planned to
join picket lines after delivering the food, said spokeswoman Elaine
Harris.
   The caravan was part of a nationwide call by the AFL-CIO to help
the striking miners. Tractor-trailer trucks bearing food from union
members in Pennsylvania are expected to arrive next week, Harris
said.
   ``This is just the start,'' she said.

dealings with an undercover agent who was posing as a drug-money
launderer, and with an associate later convicted of money laundering.
   Swindall, 38, faces 10 months to five years in prison on each
count.
   The jury began its deliberations Friday afternoon, following

   A man who learned how to yell in the
swamps of eastern North Carolina captured the National Hollerin'
Contest championship Saturday night with fire siren-style whoop.
   ``I think you have to be mentally prepared,'' said the champion,
Tommy Tatum, 41, a tire company worker who lives in Stedman.
``You've got to have it in you. I came from deep in the swamp when I
was a kid and, it (hollerin`) was used at that time.''
   State Agriculture Commissioner Jim Graham, who performed a donkey
bray for the crowd estimated at more than 1,000, presented the
trophy to Tatum.
   The 21-year-old contest drew representatives from Norway,
Australia, Sweden and Japan. The ancient communications art was
widely used by farmers in the Southeast to convey messages to others
before the telephone was invented.
   Hollerin' styles this year spanned a vocal range from
slow-rolling ``yee-ooh-haws'' to yodels, staccato barks and chicken
noises.
   Ninety-year-old Dewey Jackson, who won the first championship in
1969, performed a wordless, whooping rendition of the song, ``What a
Friend We Have In Jesus.''
   The tiny crossroads community of Spivey's Corner, population 49 _
located about 35 miles south of Raleigh _ was picked as the site for
the event ``because I didn't think there was anywhere else in the
world where people wouldn't get upset when folks got to hollerin`,''
said organizer Ermon Godwin.

   A National Guard helicopter crashed in
dense fog early Saturday, killing all six crewmen and just missing
homes in this Cape Cod tourist haven, authorities said.
   The UH-1 Bell helicopter cut a 20-foot wide path through the
woods before crashing, throwing its doors, glass and other debris
more than 30 feet. The cockpit was shattered beyond recognition, and
doors and glass were found 20 feet away.
   ``We said, `This guy's going to crash,' and a couple of seconds
later he did,'' said witness John Palino. The helicopter missed his
home by about 100 feet, crashing behind a neighbor's home.
   ``It was like a crumpled piece of paper,'' Palino said. ``We
didn't want to get near it because we were afraid it would explode.''
   Palino said he and his son went with flashlights and found two
bodies on the ground. ``The ones we saw you could tell they were
really young,'' he said.
   Three victims were members of a Delaware Army National Guard unit
from New Castle, Del., that had just completed the first week of an
annual two-week training exercise at Camp Edwards in Mashpee.
   Delaware guard spokeswoman Terry Blevins identified them as 1st
Lt. David Joseph Hendry, 26, and Chief Warrant Officer Hugh Bryan
Pearce, 35, both of Wilmington, and Staff Sgt. Benjamin Robert
Greenplate, 40, of Newark, Del.
   Another victim was identified as Sgt. Ward Arthur Cornell, 43, of
Mansfield, Conn., said Maj. Gen. John T. Gereski, Connecticut's
adjutant general.
   The other two victims were from a Richmond unit, the 80th
Maneuver Training Command, and were identified as Master Sgt. Robert
E. Lucey Jr. of Emporia, Va., and Spec. Samuel K. May of Richmond,
said Virginia Army Reserve spokeswoman Maj. Mari K. Eder. No ages
were immediately available, she said.
   The helicopter crashed shortly after midnight Saturday while
returning to the camp from Rhode Island's main commercial airport in
Warwick, said Army spokeswoman 1st. Lt. Colleen Hammond.
   The helicopter had left Camp Edwards at 6:45 p.m. Friday to pick
up a military official due in at T.F. Greene Airport on a commercial
flight from Philadelphia, Hammond said. After waiting two hours, the
helicopter crew learned the flight was grounded and decided to
return to the base.
   ``That's the last we know,'' Hammond said.
   The helicopter went down about 30 miles from the camp, she said.
Army officials said the cause of the crash was being investigated.
   Neighbors said they could tell the helicopter was having trouble.
   ``You could hear the blades stopping and (then) like a thump,''
neighbor Bill O'Connor said.
   Kenneth Chesley said he slept through the crash, but his wife,
who was watching television, said their entire house vibrated.
   Yarmouth's winter population of 20,000 swells to 80,000 with the
onset of tourist season, police said. The town is approximately 85
miles south of Boston.

<HEAD>INS Official, Agent Offer Their Blood For Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials offered last week to donate blood for former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos, who has been hospitalized since January,
a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Roy Hendricks, the newly appointed acting district director, and
INS agent Ben Alexander made the offer Friday while visiting Marcos'
wife, Imelda, to serve her with notice that she is banned from
traveling, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported.
   ``Their offer made me cry,'' Mrs. Marcos said. ``Imagine,
offering their blood to someone who is not even an American.
   ``They are real human beings, these two men,'' Mrs. Marcos said.
``They put humanity before business. These little people, these
errand boys, showed me what America is really like.''
   ``I don't remember saying that,'' Hendricks said. ``I'm not
saying I did say it and I'm not saying I didn't say it. I just don't
remember.''
   ``I have no comment on it,'' Alexander said. ``If that was said,
it was meant as a private, not public offering.''
   The newspaper said one of its reporters, who also was at the
house, heard the remarks.
   Marcos, 71, underwent surgery Saturday to stop a bleeding gastric
ulcer. He has been hospitalized since January and has remained on
life support equipment since suffering cardiac, lung and kidney
failure last month.
   Both Marcoses are under U.S. indictment for allegedly stealing
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury and stashing it
in the United States. Mrs. Marcos is free on $5 million bail.
   During the 45-minute meeting with Mrs. Marcos, which was
videotaped by a Marcos family aide, Hendricks advised her ``to be
strong,'' ``take care of yourself,'' ``cling to your religious
beliefs'' and ``have confidence in the U.S. legal system ... because
it works, it really works,'' the newspaper said.
   The travel ban requires Mrs. Marcos to notify the INS in writing
48 hours before she travels and is similar to travel restrictions
imposed on Marcos 18 months ago.
   Hendricks said he does not know what prompted the order against
Mrs. Marcos, but the travel ban document says immigration officials
``have reason to believe that you intend to depart from the United
States in a manner which would be prejudicial to the interests of
the United States.''
   Hendricks was named Monday to succeed William Craig, who retired
earlier this month.
   Craig said his retirement was planned before the disclosure last
month that he had arranged a controversial party last August at the
Marcos estate here for INS Western Regional Commissioner Harold
Ezell and other INS officials.
   Ezell later admitted that it was an error to attend the party, at
which he and his wife were videotaped as they danced with the
Marcoses and he led a prayer asking for the Marcos' safe return to
the Philippines.

   When Jack Kemp accepted President Bush's offer
to become secretary of Housing and Urban Development, it looked like
a welcome chance to stay in the spotlight after the failure of his
Republican presidential campaign.
   Now that he is on the job, Kemp faces the task of cleaning up and
airing out what may be the worst financial abuses lingering from the
Reagan administration.
   The department that was regarded as a governmental backwater
during eight years under Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. has been
shaken by a series of scandals stemming from that period.
   Kemp, appearing Saturday on Cable News Network's ``Evans and
Novak'' program, said abuses in HUD were not unique to the Reagan
administration and that political influence in the department
existed ``a lot longer than eight years.''
   Kemp said Bush should get credit for any reforms at HUD, adding,
``There was a poison in the system. And we have moved quickly to
take the poison out.''
   So far investigators report finding what appears to be
multimillion-dollar fraud, the steering of millions in public funds
to politically connected developers and consultants, and
mismanagement on a staggering scale.
   ``The scandal at HUD is one of the most complex national scandals
that we have seen in decades,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.,
chairman of a House subcommittee investigating the department.
   ``There is a degree of mismanagement, fraud, abuse, waste,
influence-peddling that we have just barely begun to touch,'' he
said.
   Following charges on Capitol Hill that the Justice Department was
showing little interest in some of the scandal, Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh on Thursday ordered federal prosecutors to
investigate all HUD offices for fraud and embezzlement.
   The revelations have come so fast that investigators are
hard-pressed to keep up. Together they suggest that HUD had become a
financial honey pot for developers, contractors, well-connected
Republicans and others _ all in an era when the department was
subjected to large-scale cutbacks in social spending.
   Pierce was one of the least-visible of Reagan's Cabinet
secretaries and the only one to serve throughout Reagan's eight
years as president. While his low-key role earned him the nickname
``Silent Sam'' in office, he has become the political focus of
congressional outrage.
   ``Like picking up a large stone only to discover that bugs and
slime have grown in the darkness, this investigation has exposed the
corruption which flourished unchecked under Secretary Pierce's
HUD,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a subcommittee member.
   ``Secretary Sam Pierce ran the most sloppy, incompetent agency in
government that we have seen in perhaps a generation,'' said Lantos.
   Pierce did not return phone calls to his New York law firm.
Appearing before Lantos's committee last month, he said he delegated
decisions about awarding HUD grants to aides, including his
executive assistant Deborah Gore Dean.
   Dean refused to testify, citing her Fifth Amendment rights
against self-incrimination. She has been quoted by the Wall Street
Journal as saying of the renovation program, ``We ran it in a
political manner.''
   Kemp has ordered investigations and has been praised by Lantos
and others in Congress for dealing with the problems. The first of
the scandals was revealed when Kemp released internal reports by
Paul Adams, the department's inspector general.
   They said millions of dollars in HUD subsidies for renovation of
low-income housing was distributed without regard to need or
fairness, and that much of it was steered to private developers who
formerly had been HUD officials or had ties to prominent Republicans.
   Adams found that developers who won subsidies paid millions of
dollars in consulting fees to former HUD officials and prominent
Republicans. Among them was former Interior Secretary James Watt,
who was paid some $400,000. Others include Paul Manafort, a
Republican businessman who was a partner with Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater before Atwater became Bush's 1988 campaign
manager; and the late Attorney General John Mitchell, who was a
close family friend of Dean.
   Few of the consultants had housing experience. There has been
little evidence they did much work for their money, beyond making
phone calls and holding meetings with Pierce or other HUD officials
to secure the subsidy contracts for their projects.
   The inspector general concluded there was a high cost to
taxpayers in the program's mismanagement. He reported HUD could pay
$413 million in excess rental assistance over the 15-year subsidy
agreements because of the contracts.
   The Justice Department has been reviewing HUD's internal audit of
the program, but spokesman Joseph Krovisky said its preliminary
review ``didn't show any criminal violations.''
   Perhaps even more startling than the revelations about
well-connected consultants is evidence of embezzlement by real
estate agents under contract to represent HUD in the sale of
property HUD owned because of foreclosures.
   These agents were retained to close the sales and send the
proceeds to HUD. It is a task that the Reagan administration took
away from HUD employees and contracted out as part of the
``privatization'' of government.
   A Maryland woman, Marilyn Loise Harrell, has told investigators
she used her contract with HUD to improperly take as much as $5.5
million.
   Her scheme was hardly complicated. She told investigators that at
first she began banking the money for a time and collecting interest
for herself. Soon, she said, she started keeping all the money due
HUD.
   ``No one noticed when the proceeds were not remitted,'' she said
in a sworn statement.
   She contends she used the money for charitable causes.
Investigators, though skeptical, nicknamed her ``Robin HUD.''
   Similarly, a grand jury in Fort Worth, Texas, indicted Reba
Louise Lovell on charges of stealing $2.5 million from the sale of
55 homes around Dallas. In Washington, D.C., investigators are
looking for a lawyer who disappeared over a year ago after serving
as HUD's agent, and officials have said more than $3 million may be
missing.
   Auditors and prosecutors are looking at all HUD property sale
arrangements, and HUD officials expect the reports of embezzlement
to grow.
   Investigators say they do not suspect a conspiracy among the
agents to defraud the government, but believe each independently
discovered the same thing: no one at HUD was paying attention.
   Still another scandal swirls around New York's Republican
senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato. A report in The New York Times, based
in part on a 5-year-old HUD audit, said officials in the village of
Island Park on Long Island rigged the distribution of federally
subsidized houses in the early 1980s, selecting politically
connected recipients and keeping out blacks.
   Among those allowed to purchase subsidized, inexpensive homes was
a cousin of D'Amato and the son of Geraldine McGann, a high-ranking
HUD administrator who also sat on the village board. Some of the
subsidized houses were later resold at substantial profits.
   Kemp has ordered a new audit and placed McGann on leave.
   D'Amato has denied wrongdoing. But thanks to his lobbying, the
village last year received $1 million in HUD money for construction
of a swimming pool.
   D'Amato also has figured in allegations about the renovation
subsidy program. A former HUD official told the Wall Street Journal
that D'Amato pushed for approval of subsidy funds for projects in
Puerto Rico _ and apparently with some success since 7 percent of
the program's funds went to that small island territory. D'Amato
denied helping developers in Puerto Rico.
   In addition, Kemp aide Mary Brunette said HUD has asked the U.S.
attorney in Denver to investigate allegations that an accountant in
the agency's regional office manipulated an automated bill-paying
system to siphon off $1 million.

   The nation's mayors, after eight years of
complaining that they were ignored by the White House, searched for
signs the Bush administration will be more responsive as they
gathered for their annual meeting Saturday.
   ``We feel the needs of the people of our major cities have not
been given the priority that they should have been'' over the past
decade, said Mayor Kathy Whitmire of Houston.
   President Bush declined an invitation to attend the annual
meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, a convention of more than
200 elected urban leaders that runs through Wednesday.
   Two of his Cabinet secretaries and other administration officials
planned to address the mayors, who have asked the administration to
outline how it intends to establish its national urban policy.
   ``We spent a good deal of our time under the Reagan
administration trying to save our programs,'' said J. Thomas
Cochran, executive director of the conference. ``Now we're in a
situation where Mr. Bush has been elected and we're trying to see
what a kinder and gentler administration will mean.''
   Dealing with drugs, AIDS and homelessness are among the top
concerns on the mayors' agendas. Cochran said many mayors believe
their cities are the front lines in those battles and that they were
not given enough voice in the previous administration's handling of
them.
   ``Those are three very lonely issues,'' Cochran said in an
interview. ``We believe we've been setting national policy. It is
only fair that if Congress is going to come forth on housing or
drugs that we be involved. ... We'd like to be back at the table.''
   Republican Mayor Bob Isaac of Colorado Springs, Colo., said at an
opening news conference that the absence of Bush and Vice President
Dan Quayle should not be read as a lack of administration interest
in urban problems.
   Some Democratic mayors were inclined to agree _ but suggested
they expected better in the future.
   ``In fairness, the president was abroad most recently and he's
got to weigh his schedule,'' said Mayor Joseph Riley of the host
city, a former president of the group and leading urban advocate.
   ``I wouldn't let the fact that the first year they didn't come
make a statement,'' he said. ``Hopefully, they'll make it next year.
But if not, then there might be reason to be concerned.''
   Whitmire, a Democrat who is in line to become president of the
group this week, said mayors ``are certainly optimistic'' and have
found ``the doors to be open'' so far in the new administration.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, whose
department has been rocked by charges of multimillion-dollar fraud
and influence peddling during the Reagan adminisration, is scheduled
to address the mayors Monday. Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K.
Reilly are to speak Tuesday.
   Bush's new proposals to cut acid rain and curb urban smog are
among the issues on the mayors' agenda. Others include crime, day
care, housing, mass transit, regulation of cable television and
maintaining congressional support for the remaining federal urban
aid programs.
   The mayors will vote on dozens of resolutions, including one
proposal that calls for increased federal aid and cuts in defense
spending as a way to provide more aid for urban programs.
   The troubles at HUD may be aired at a workshop the mayors plan,
although mayors avoided any criticism of HUD's previous management
at an opening news conference.
   The HUD scandals are a blow to cities, however, because the
department is the agency that handles much of the federal aid
flowing to urban America and is the principal advocate within the
government for many of those programs.
   A frequent lament from mayors has been the Reagan
administration's fiscal assault on federal housing programs, in
which cuts in HUD's budget authority amounted to 80 percent when
adjusted for inflation.

   Hundreds of anti-abortion protesters were arrested in four states
Saturday as they sought to block health clinics, while pro-choice
activists carrying signs such as ``Keep Your Laws Off My Body''
countered with their own rallies.
   Ninety anti-abortion protesters were carried away on police
stretchers in St. Petersburg, Fla., including 23 who chained
themselves to the doors of a clinic with special bicycle locks
almost impossible to cut with normal tools.
   ``No children were killed in this building today _ we shut down
the clinic,'' said the Rev. Christopher Osborne, pastor of River of
Life Fellowship and leader of the protest.
   Deborah Struthers, head of the All Women's Health Clinic, said
all appointments, including some planned abortions, had been
postponed or diverted to other facilities.
   Frustrated authorities had to call the group's local attorney to
negotiate the chained protesters' surrender, said police spokesman
Wendall Creager. A member of the group finally provided keys to the
locks, and the demonstrators were removed and booked on charges of
trespassing and resisting without violence, police said.
   The protesters were met at the clinic by about 20
counter-demonstrators.
   ``This issue is not only about abortion, but a woman's right to
health care,'' said Linda Osten, president of the Upper Pinellas
National Organization For Women. ``These people brought their lies
and propaganda here today, but the majority of Americans know women
need choices.''
   Chicago police carried away dozens of anti-abortion protesters by
their arms and legs outside a North Side clinic. Seventy-three
people will be charged with mob action and disorderly conduct,
police Sgt. James Larner said.
   About 2,000 abortion rights demonstrators held a rally at the
Daley Plaza in downtown Chicago.
   Signs in the crowd of mostly women read: ``Keep Your Laws Off My
Body,'' ``Keep Abortions Legal,'' and ``The Choice is Mine.''
   At one point, about 250 anti-abortion demonstrators showed up at
the plaza carrying red traffic stop signs that read, ``Stop Abortion
Now.''
   A double police barricade kept the two sides apart, but they
chanted back and forth at each other, ``Choice, choice, choice,''
and ``Roe V. Wade Has Got to Go.''
   Numerous abortion protests, both pro and con, have occurred
around the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court began considering a
case which could reverse the Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973. The
ruling made abortion legal in the early stages of pregnancy.
   In West Hartford, Conn., about 100 anti-abortion protesters
occupied the Summit Women's Center, jamming elevators and an
operating room and halting clinic operations while as many as 300
people sang and demonstrated outside. Some carried a banner that
read, ``Killing Factory Closed.''
   Police arrested 261 protesters and took them by city bus to the
police station, said officer Douglas R. Ahlstrin. Some struggled and
shouted out Biblical passages as they were dragged to the buses.
   On the other side of the street, about 100 pro-choice
demonstrators carried signs saying, ``Stand Up For Choice'' and
``Defend Abortion Rights'' and chanted ``Not the Church, Not the
State, Women Will Decide Our Fate.''
   ``I think this boils down to that it's a woman's right and keep
the government out of it,'' said Laura D. Verbarg, who said she was
driving past the demonstration when she decided to join the
pro-choice advocates.
   In Dallas, about 250 people demonstrated and 44 were arrested
during a demonstration at Routh Street Women's Clinic, said a police
spokeswoman who refused to give her name.
   The protest, organized by the anti-abortion group Dallas Rescue,
was dubbed ``Father's Day Rescue, said Laura Weston, a spokeswoman
for the group.
   ``The father is supposed to protect his wife, the mother, and his
children,'' Ms. Weston said.

   Two U.S. altitude records, including one that had
stood for 51 years, have been broken by an unmanned aircraft
developed by The Boeing Co.
   The black and silver aircraft, nicknamed the ``Condor,'' set an
altitude record for piston-powered aircraft by reaching 66,980 feet
above sea level during a test flight, Boeing Advanced Systems said
in a news release.
   That broke a world-class maximum altitude record of 56,046 feet
set by Italian Mario Pezzi in a Caproni biplane in October 1938.
   At the same time, the Condor also set a special-category national
record for altitude in horizontal flight, beating the world-class,
manned record of 31,791.72 feet for piston aircraft set in 1983 by
Stephen Oster, an American.
   The records were certified Wednesday by the National Aeronautic
Association, the U.S. representative of the Federation Aeronautique
Internationale, the world body responsible for tracking aviation
records.
   The Condor is twin-engine, robotic aircraft designed for flights
of up to several days. The plane can operate completely on its own
from takeoff through landing, flying a pre-programmed mission stored
in its onboard computers.
   Boeing Advanced Systems, a Boeing operating company, has been
developing the plane for such uses as reconnaissance, communications
relay, weather research and border patrol. The U.S. Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency has provided money for flight tests.
   The record-setting flight took place Feb. 26 over eastern
Washington.

   A homemade gyrocopter crashed into a lake
Saturday, killing two people, authorities said.
   The bodies of a Kentucky couple were recovered from Acton Lake at
Hueston Woods State Park, said Park Manager Joel Udstuen. They were
identified as Robert W. Wahn, 56, and his wife Betty, 48, both of
Verona.
   Mike Stein of the Ohio State Patrol aviation division said
gyrocopters differ from helicopters in that a helicopter's engine
drives the overhead rotor, while a gyrocopter's engine drives a rear
rotor, Stein said. Backwash from the gyrocopter's rear blade powers
the overhead rotor.
   Pilots of gyrocopters must have a pilot's license and register
their aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Witness Sally Phillipson said she and a friend were walking by
the lake when they heard an engine sputtering. Ms. Phillipson said
she saw the aircraft lose a rotor and plunge into the waters of the
lake.
   Udstuen said officers recovered a fuselage and a rotor blade.
   The park is located near the Ohio-Indiana border.

   U.S. citizens need visas to enter
Nicaragua beginning July 1, and President Daniel Ortega said
Saturday the measure is necessary to prevent Washington from
meddling in his country's affairs.
   Panama's de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, on
Saturday urged Nicaragua not to hold elections as scheduled next
February because of what he described as U.S. interference.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Falino declined comment on the visa
requirement, and officials with the Foreign Ministry, which
announced the measure late Friday, were not available.
   The leftist government has expressed suspicion that the United
States may attempt to affect the outcome of the February elections.
   The opposition newspaper La Prensa said in its Saturday editions
that the visa requirement is ``a legal formula to prevent an
avalanche of U.S. journalists and political observers from coming to
analyze and observe what occurs in our elections.''
   Ortega, speaking in a Managua suburb, said his government will
require visiting Americans to visas ``because the employees of the
yanqui government continue to abuse the hospitality'' of Nicaragua.
He said Washington continues to ``conspire against the people of
Nicaragua.''
   Noriega, head of Panama's Defense Forces, said the United States
participated in irregularities during Panama's May 7 elections,
which international observers say the opposition won but the
government nullified.
   ``Nicaragua: keep your eyes open. Don't be fools. Don't hold
elections because they will repeat the same medicine of Panama,''
Noriega told parlimentarians from 10 Latin American countries
meeting in David, 250 miles west of Panama City.
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista party,
and El Nuevo Diario, a pro-government dailyand El Nuevo Diario have
published stories in the past few days about a ``secret plan'' to
funnel $3 million to Nicaragua's opposition parties.
   The Sandinista government has said several times that the
February elections will be a ``political confrontation'' with the
United States, which supports the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
   Earlier this month the Foreign Ministry said U.S. diplomats will
not be allowed to act as election observers. ``To invite them would
be the equivalent of asking the fox to guard the henhouse,'' it said.
   It also said the American diplomats could not attend opposition
party meetings or rallies.
   Nicaragua has twice expelled U.S. diplomats over the past year,
accusing them of interfering in its internal affairs.
   In May it expelled Kathleen Williamson Barnon, a labor attache,
and economic attache Joel Franklin Cassman saying they tried ``to
manipulate'' teachers into a nationwide strike.
   The U.S. responded six days later by expelling two Nicaraguan
diplomats, Wiliam Vigil and Roberto Vargas.
   In July last year, a large opposition rally brought about another
series of expulsions. Nicaragua ordered U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other diplomats to leave and Washington retaliated
by expelling the Nicaraguan ambassador.

   A man used a boat paddle to kill a poisonous snake
that he says threatened a friend, but was fined $50 for molesting
and killing wildlife in a protected area.
   David McDonald, 23, and Kellyn Barnes, 24, were among seven
people on a rafting trip Sunday on the Chattahoochee River near
Atlanta when Ms. Barnes nearly stepped on the copperhead on shore.
   ``The snake was the same grayish-green color as the ground so I
didn't see him until he drew his head back like a cobra does when
he's about to bite. He was inches away from my foot,'' she recalled.
``I panicked and screamed.''
   McDonald then killed the reptile. A park ranger who was watching
through binoculars issued the ticket.
   ``All I'd done was kill a poisonous snake, which could have
bitten someone,'' McDonald said.
   Beverly Summers of the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta said the
ranger was acting under a federal statute that bans killing any
wildlife on national park land.

<TEXT>
   The New York Board of Regents on Friday
banned a commercial-laden news program from the state's high
schools, becoming the second state in the nation to frown on the
project.
   The regents rejected Whittle Communications' ``Channel One''
program, saying they were worried the ``active commercialization''
of the programs would send the wrong message to high school students.
   The 12-minute news program contains two minutes of commercials
for candy, jeans, acne cream and other products aimed at teen-agers.
In return for an agreement to show the daily programs, Whittle wired
high schools with complete closed circuit television systems,
including satellite dishes, televisions and videocassette recorders.
   ``It's a very tempting package that has a flaw,'' state Education
Commissioner Thomas Sobol.
   The decision is a blow to the Tennessee-based Whittle, which has
said it needs to sign up 40 percent of the nation's high schools if
``Channel One'' was to be successful. Earlier this month, California
officials threatened their schools with a loss of funding if they
signed contracts with Whittle.
   Some regents also expressed anger with Whittle's aggressive
lobbying in support of ``Channel One.'' Edward Meyer of Westchester
County charged that some members of the education board told him
Whittle had offered them jobs or consulting contracts if they
supported the project.
   Meyer declined to name the regents involved and several other
regents interviewed denied any knowledge of such offers. Laura
Eshbaugh, executive vice president for Whittle Communications, said
she knew nothing about any offers.
   Eshbaugh said she was disappointed with the decision by the New
York board, but said ``Channel One'' would be able to survive the
rejection.
   Whittle had increased its offer to the regents and taken its case
to the public in the days leading to Friday morning's board meeting.
The company ran two full-page advertisements in The New York Times,
and Meyer said some regents were bombarded by ``junk fax'' messages
in support of Whittle.
   Whittle offered to donate 1,000 hours of satellite time so other
educational programming could be shown in schools, education
department officials said. The company also said it would pay
$500,000 to New York's Public Broadcasting System.
   But Whittle wouldn't take out the commercials.
   Several regents said they worried the commercials would cause
poor students who couldn't afford items advertised to feel
inadequate. They also said the program seems geared to suburban
students instead of the more troubled city schools that need the
technology Whittle could provide.
   But Eshbaugh said schools contain many forms of advertising, such
as wall posters, yearbook advertisements and brand names emblazoned
on the clothing students wear.
   ``Commercialization is there,'' she said. ``However any of us
might not like it there, it's there to stay.''

<TEXT>
   The political opposition accepted on
Friday a proposal for a three-sided dialogue with the government and
military that was proposed by the Organization of American States.
   The Defense Forces have not signaled whether they will accept,
however.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces and
Panama's de facto leader, has said repeatedly the military is
unwilling to take part in negotiations and that civilian government
officials should hold the discussions.
   The opposition has said the military must be included in any
settlement talks because Noriega holds real power here.
   At a lunch with businessmen, opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara read a declaration accepting the OAS proposal.
   ``We are willing to initiate immediate direct conversations with
the Defense Forces and its commander-in-chief, so that we can reach
a national accord that assures the transfer of power by September
1989,'' he read.
   An OAS delegation concluded a three-day visit to Panama on
Wednesday. The mission followed a previous OAS visit in May to end
Panama's political crisis.
   International observers said the opposition won May 7 elections.
The government nullified the election, citing foreign intervention.
   Endara and vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford signed the
declaration with the titles of president-elect and vice
president-elect.
   Noriega told the four OAS negotiators U.S. intransigence was to
blame for Panama's problems.
   The mission is to deliver a report on its findings at a July 19
meeting of OAS foreign ministers.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida last year on federal
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. He denies the
charges. Then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire him, but
Noriega orchestrated Delvalle's ouster.
   The United States has tried to force Noriega out. It froze more
than $140 million in Panamanian bank deposits and canal payments,
hobbling the banking industry and leaving the government
ill-equipped to meet payrolls or fund basic social programs.

   Some officials from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa
have requested refugee status in Canada, Foreign Affairs Minister
Joe Clark said Friday.
   Clark would not say how many Chinese diplomatic staff had asked,
and he declined to say if there have been defections among the
staffs of the Chinese consulates in Toronto and Vancouver.
   ``I can confirm that there have been approaches by some officials
of the Chinese Embassy indicating the desire to stay in Canada,'' he
told reporters outside the House of Commons. ``I don't propose to
discuss names or numbers or locations or any details.
   A source told The Canadian Press that five officials from the
embassy and two from the consulate in Vancouver had asked as of
Thursday to remain in Canada.
   The foreign minister said requests from Chinese for refugee
status will be handled sympathetically.
   Clark met Thursday with Chinese Ambassador Zhang Wenpu to
protest, for the second time this month, the actions taken by China
against students and others seeking greater democracy.
   Canada also recalled its ambassador, Earl Drake, for
consultations.

   President Bush's decision to offer protection
to all Chinese citizens in the United States has paved the way for
at least two more Chinese diplomats to obtain refuge here.
   A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Friday that besides the two Chinese diplomats who announced in
San Francisco they intended to defect, ``there have been additional
Chinese officials who have asked for protection in the United
States.''
   He refused to give a specific number who have sought refuge, nor
to confirm a report that a husband and wife, both diplomats in the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, were the diplomats in question.
   According to published and broadcast reports, those two are Han
Guohong, secretary to the ambassador, and her husband Zhang Chiwei,
an attache in the press office at the embassy in Washington. There
was no one available for comment at the embassy early today.

   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater has
been handed a fresh vote of confidence from party leaders and a
challenge from his Democratic counterpart ``to move politics in this
nation out of the gutter.''
   Atwater, under fire from Democrats and critics within the GOP for
his rough-and-tumble style of politics, was praised in a resolution
Friday by the party's national committee.
   The committee's resolution said Atwater's aggressive stance has
``made him the target of unremitting attacks from Democrats and
their surrogates'' and he should keep it up.
   The resolution neglected to mention the controversy surrounding a

Atwater's office compared the voting record of the new House speaker
with that of Rep. Barney Frank, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who
has acknowledged being homosexual.

   Women who choose against nursing their newborn
children may have to get along without hormones and drugs that
prevent painful breast engorgement.
   The Food and Drug Administration says it will ask drug companies
to stop promoting these hormones and drugs for non-nursing mothers
because they are no more effective than mild analgesics or breast
supports and may do harm.
   FDA officials plan to meet soon with drug companies about getting
them to agree to stop marketing the medicines for that purpose.
   ``I'm sure we'll agree to ask the companies to comply with the

   BANIYAS, Israeli-annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ U.S. and Israeli
archaeologists have unearthed a Roman metropolis that in its heyday
was the ancient world's equivalent of New York.
   Founded in about A.D. 10 by Herod Philip, son of King Herod the
Great, ancient Baniyas grew over the next several hundred years
``into a huge city,'' archaeologist Vassilios Tzarferis of the
Israel Antiquities Department recently said.
   ``We can estimate the population in Roman times of up to 15,000
people, which for those days means it was a New York,'' Tzarferis
said.
   Traces of ruined villas can be found a mile from the city center,
he said.

   Rock behemoths the Who, going out on the
road for the first time since their ``farewell tour'' in 1982, are
returning to the stage far from big-city footlights.
   The rock veterans will open their 36-date summer stadium tour
June 21 in a relatively small 8,000-seat arena in this city on the
edge of the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York.
   Tickets went on sale June 14 and were completely snapped up in 82
minutes, officials said.
   But the big question on the collective minds of the rock world is
why Glens Falls and not New York, Los Angeles or Chicago?
   Because that's where the Who is spending more than a week
rehearsing, getting its mammoth stage and show ready to hit the big
time. The band's organization wanted a ``dress rehearsal'' before
the first stadium show in Toronto, said publicist Sean Mahoney.
   ``It's something we'll be proud to talk about for decades to
come,'' said David Covey, station manager of WWSC-FM. ``The No. 1
thing on everybody's mind is `how can I get tickets?'''
   Original members Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle
are reuniting to mark the Who's 25th anniversary. They're planning
three-hour shows at stadiums across the country, plus full
performances of the rock opera ``Tommy'' in New York as a benefit
and in Los Angeles.
   But first, they'll have to make it in Glens Falls.
   ``It's going to be a shot in the arm for us,'' said Glens Falls
Mayor Frank O'Keefe. ``They've rented the civic center for an
extended period of time. They're going to bring a lot of activity to
the city and we're glad to have them.
   ``I never heard of Who, but my two teen-agers told me about
them,'' O'Keefe said. ``The younger society _ not that I'm old _ are
getting awfully excited about it.''
   For Glens Falls, it's a payoff for the civic center's growing
reputation as a place where many big names of the entertainment
industry go _ to rehearse, if not necessarily to perform.
   With its out-of-the-way location and one of the country's most
popular outdoor entertainment venues just a half hour south in
Saratoga Springs, the Glens Falls Civic Center is empty for much of
the summer.
   To make ends meet, arena management began asking entertainers
five or six years ago if they wanted to rent out the place to
rehearse. Artists such as Billy Joel, Def Leppard and Judas Priest
have said yes.
   When he heard the Who were reforming several months ago, civic
center manager Jack Kelley said he began making overtures to the
band and kept his fingers crossed.
   ``This is a very funny business and people do change their minds
very quickly,'' said Kelley, a former general manager of the
Hartford Whalers hockey team.
   Most of the time, bands that rent out the civic center look to
lower their costs by agreeing to a public peformance there, he said.
That's what happened with the Who.
   Despite security guards ringing the civic center during the Who's
rehearsal time, most of what goes on inside isn't particularly
exciting. Stage managers and roadies spend a lot of time putting the
stage, sound equipment and lights together and make sure they can be
disassembled quickly.
   Townshend, Daltrey and crew will actually be on stage only
briefly in the empty arena to practice songs such as ``My
Generation'' and ``Baba O'Riley,'' Kelley said.
   On the tour itinerary, the Glens Falls date is pointedly listed
as a ``warm-up show.'' The Who may need the extra time to get used
to all its new personnel. Drummer Simon Phillips has replaced Kenney
Jones for this tour. John Bundrick will play keyboards and Steve
Bolton will play guitar.
   Townshend, who reportedly has severe ear problems brought on by
years of power chords on his electric guitar, will stick to an
acoustic guitar for the shows.
   The band will also cart around a horn section, a percussion
section and three back-up singers.
   Although the Who doesn't have a new album and has no plans for
one, the band is expected to play cuts from Townshend's solo album,
``The Iron Man,'' due out at the end of this month.
   The huge stage built for outdoor shows dwarfs Glens Falls' tiny
arena. To fit all of the equipment, the civic center will only be
able to use roughly 5,000 of its 8,000 seats.
   Even before tickets went on sale, Kelley said he was already sick
of all the tickets pleas he has received from friends and
acquaintances.
   For this city of 20,000 people, it's easily the entertainment
event of its life.

<HEAD>``Triple Witching Hour'' Detonates Trading Bursts But No Harmful
Fallout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite detonating two bursts of stock trading on
Wall Street, the ``triple witching hour'' didn't produce damaging
fallout.
   Uneasiness about what might happen during the quarterly
occurrence had scared many individual investors away from the market
for days. They decided they'd be safer to wait until the dust
settled Friday before transacting their stock business.
   The simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures, index options
and stock options can cause volatile swings in stock prices as
investors holding those contracts try to balance their books by
buying or selling the underlying stocks.
   As predicted, the stock market opened with a bang on Friday.
Within the first half hour of trading on the Big Board, more than
107 million shares changed hands and most of them moved in the first
15 minutes. By contrast, NYSE volume at 10 a.m. EDT the previous day
totaled a more normal 26.31 million shares.
   ``The market handled the heavy volume at the opening quite
well,'' said Newton D. Zinder, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. ``All the large blocks of stock were absorbed.''
   Share prices didn't suffer a big jolt, indicating how well the
market coped with the crush of trading orders. The Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks managed to eke out a small
gain in the early going, while measures of activity in the broader
market posted only minor losses.
   Stock exchange procedures aimed at relieving market volatility
apparently did the trick. The procedures are used on the third
Friday of the last month in each quarter of the calendar year when
the futures and options expire.
   Zinder said most of the orders were sales and ``by posting, or
advertising those blocks, they were able to attract some buyers,
mitigating any weakness that might have occurred.''
   Basically, each quarter the NYSE requires prior notification of
orders related to complicated trading strategies used by
professional investors designed to profit from price discrepancies
between stocks and various stock-linked futures and options.
   On Friday, orders due to take place at the opening had to be
received by 9 a.m. EDT, while orders to be executed at the close had
to be in by 3 p.m. EDT, moved up from 3:30 p.m. on past expiration
Fridays, in an effort to ease pressure at the end of the session.
   Speculation swirled around the market all week that an unusually
large level of ``open interest'' in the futures market _ meaning
more contracts than normal hadn't been closed before expiration _
could cause severe price gyrations in the stock market on Friday.
   No wild swings transpired and share price barometers registered
temperate readings throughout the day before closing with modest
gains.
   Trading exploded again near the close, contributing to the
heaviest single-day volume on the Big Board in about five months.
Volume came to 244.51 million shares, making for the busiest session
since Jan. 27 when 254.87 million shares were traded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,486.38, down 27.04 from a week earlier. It brought the loss over
the past two weeks to 31.45 points.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.78 to 179.59;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market declined
6.44 to 447.21; and, the American Stock Exchange market value index
was off 4.33 at 361.83.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 182.17 million shares a day,
down slightly from 182.37 million the week before.

<HEAD>Sequel to the Boesky Verses: Mulheren Indicted, Milken Forms Own
Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivan Boesky may still be scraping plates in a
prison canteen, but the speculator's legacy is writing more chapters
in the Wall Street securities fraud opus: the indictment of a former
stock-trading pal who plotted to kill him, and the founding of a new
firm by America's junk-bond pioneer.
   Boesky's status as chief government informant got another big
boost this past week when a Manhattan federal grand jury charged his
one-time friend and fellow speculator, John Mulheren, in a 42-count
indictment alleging securities fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy and
phony record-keeping.
   The indictment represented another notch on the gun for the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which has used Boesky's
confessions as the basis for what has become the biggest fraud
scandal in Wall Street history.
   For Mulheren, the indictment capped months of speculation that he
had been implicated in serious wrongdoing by Boesky, who has been
serving a three-year term at a minimum-security federal prison in
California since March 1988.
   Before Boesky was incarcerated, police had arrested Mulheren for
threatening to kill Boesky with an assault rifle. Associates of
Mulheren said at the time he was depressed and angered that his
one-time colleague in the stock speculation business was squealing
in exchange for lenient treatment.
   A day after the Mulheren indictment, another victim of Boesky's
took a dramatically different approach to the future. Michael
Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s pioneering purveyor of
high-yield, low-grade securities known as junk bonds, quit the firm
and formed his own.
   That move finally severed one of the best-known financial
relationships of the decade. Milken, one of the world's wealthiest
financiers, is considered responsible for Drexel's enormous success
in junk bonds.
   The Milken-Drexel marriage first began to deteriorate late last
year when Drexel chose to settle federal securities fraud charges
spawned by Boesky's confessions, while Milken vowed to fight them.
   Many Drexel employees and clients thought the firm had turned its
back on Milken, though he remained diplomatically silent on the
subject.
   When a federal grand jury indicted Milken in March on 98 counts
of securities fraud, tax fraud and racketeering, he took a leave of
absence from Drexel and speculation intensified he would quit.
   What remains unclear now is whether his new company,
International Capital Access Group, will draw clients and talent
away from his ex-employer. Milken said the company will offer
consulting to businesses that want to raise money. Equally unclear
is whether Milken's company will survive. He faces $1.85 billion in
forfeitures of alleged illegal profits and a lengthy prison term if
convicted in what is the largest federal securities crime
prosecution to date.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _A dazzling three-way takeover brawl unfolded between Time Inc.,
Paramount Communications Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. Time
launched a tender offer for Warner that values the company at $12.4
billion after a stock-swap deal between them collapsed. Paramount
pressed its $10.7 billion offer for Time.
   _The dollar took a wild ride, hitting the highest level in more
than three years against some currencies before tumbling in a
panicky selloff that reflected investor worries and profit-taking.
The dollar still ended the week relatively strong but its
performance raised speculation that the enthusiasm for the currency
in recent weeks might have evaporated.
   _Government economic figures presented an inconclusive picture.
The trade deficit shrank in April while business inventories rose
only slightly, suggesting economic strength, but industrial
production remained largely unchanged in May and retail sales barely
rose, suggesting weakness.
   _Two well-known food companies fell into hot water, and a
well-known company for keeping things hot fell into the hands of the
Japanese. Domino's Pizza Inc. faced a motorist lawsuit over
accusations its delivery drivers stop at nothing, including other
cars; Kraft Co. faced consumer wrath over its decision to cancel its
botched ``Ready to Roll'' contest because too many people won; and
Thermos Co. was acquired by Nippon Sanso K.K.

<HEAD>The Optimists' Rallying Cry: ``Soft Landing''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If there is a single theme that dominates talk
about the U.S. economy so far in 1989, it is embodied in the catch
phrase ``soft landing.''
   For months now, investors and business planners have been
debating whether the Federal Reserve can pull the trick off _
bringing the high-flying economy down to earth without a hard impact
that inflicts a lot of pain.
   Some skeptics dismiss the whole idea as a dangerous fantasy, the
kind of delusion that prompts companies to build new factories just
before orders suddenly dry up or speculators to buy stocks at a
market top.
   The business cycle hasn't been abolished, these observers say,
and sooner or later there will have to be a recession to wring out
the excesses of a long period of expansion.
   The doubters say they speak from long experience. But Maury
Harris, economist at the investment firm of PaineWebber Inc., says
they are overlooking two emphatic ``soft landing'' precedents in
very recent economic history.
   ``This current soft landing is a replay of the experiences in
1984-86 and 1966-67,'' he contends.
   ``Following a tighter Federal Reserve System monetary policy,
growth slowed and, because the economy was not at `full employment,'
inflation slowed enough to allow a drop in interest rates sufficient
to sustain growth.''
   One problem some people have in buying the idea of a soft
landing, Harris says, is that the term has never been clearly
defined.
   There is a formal description of recession, as monitored by the
National Bureau of Economic Research: two consecutive quarters of
declines in the nation's gross national product, after adjustment
for inflation.
   A soft landing, by contrast, has no such specific
characteristics. It might be called a non-recession, rather than a
tangible event.
   Also, Harris says, many analysts assume that the economy has
reached ``full employment'' _ a point where inflation can't be tamed
without stern measures that must almost certainly hurt business
activity.
   ``Our view for some time has been that the economy is not at
`full employment,''' Harris says. ``If we were at full employment,
wages would be rising a lot faster than the modest 3.8 percent rise
over the past year.''
   Stan Shipley and Robert Barbera, economists at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., say confusion is natural in a period when a soft
landing occurs.
   ``As the economy downshifts from rapid growth to more moderate
growth, economic statistics can be mixed,'' they observe.
   ``Often, within one month, a conflicting picture of the economy
emerges, with evidence of strength contrasted by evidence of
weakness.''
   A case in point is the index of leading economic indicators, the
government's statistical means of trying to gauge future trends. The
index was down in February and March, but rebounded strongly in
April with a 0.8 percent rise.
   When the May figure is reported later this month, it is expected
to show another drop.
   Over the last year, however, the index has edged up 2.1 percent.
That points, say Shipley and Barbera, to ``a soft landing, not a
recession.''
   Harris, for his part, acknowledges that there is ``an
understandable tendency to deny that the Fed can `fine tune' the
economy.
   ``However,'' he maintains, ``if we're not at full employment and
quite positive real interest rates allow the potential for sharp
rate declines, if necessary, there's lots of room for reversible and
nonfatal errors in Fed policies before there's too much inflation
followed by a recession.''

<HEAD>One-Time `Little Pittsburgh' Tries To Regroup As `Little Silicon
Valley'</HEAD>

   The land that spawned the detachable collar and
the nation's steel industry is losing a leading drug research firm
the same way it lost bustling mills and textile plants.
   Sterling Drug Inc. is pulling 1,200 jobs out of its operation in
East Greenbush, crimping Rensselaer County's plans to make the area
once called ``Little Pittsburgh'' into ``Little Silicon Valley.''
   ``Troy was more than `Little Pittsburgh,''' said Timothy Hulburt,
president of the Rensselaer County Chamber of Commerce. ``It was the
first Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh was the second Troy.''
   In the 1800s, the trio of cities at the Hudson and Mohawk rivers
_ Troy, Watervliet and Cohoes _ was ideally situated to become a
major industrial center. In mid-19th century America, Troy mills
pioneered the Bessemer process of converting iron to steel, a method
quickly adopted nationwide.
   Troy ironmaster Henry Burden built the world's biggest hydropower
waterwheel, and his mills churned out a horseshoe every second,
shodding almost all the horses used by the North in the Civil War.
   In 1826, Troy housewife Hannah Montague, tired of washing her
husband's shirts when only the collars were dirty, invented the
detachable collar. That sparked a new industry and earned Troy the
nickname, ``Collar City.''
   About 50 years ago, the mills and textile plants began a slow
fade to the South. By the mid-1970s, the Troy area resembled a relic
of an industrial center with little prosperity.
   ``This area was thriving and bustling with small industries that
have disappeared from the face of the earth,'' said Bill Coomley, a
lifelong Troy resident.
   Local officials say they're disappointed at the decision by
Sterling's owner, Eastman Kodak Co., to move the pharmaceutical
research and production plants to the Philadelphia area. But they
say many firms could take Sterling's place as Rensselaer County's
biggest high-tech employer.
   Sterling plans a gradual withdrawal over two years of its 950
research jobs and 260 production jobs. The research workers will
have the chance to relocate in Pennsylvania. The production workers
won't.
   Technology companies are so eager to come to Rensselaer County
``that if all (Sterling's) people were gone tomorrow, I could have
that land filled up in a month,'' said County Executive John Buono.
   Because of such institutions as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
the country's oldest engineering school, Troy and its environs have
attracted pioneers in the major industries of tomorrow, officials
said.
   ``This area has a rich tradition of innovation,'' said Michael
Wacholder, director of RPI's Rensselaer Technology Park, which
houses 35 companies dabbling in the world's most advanced technology.
   The days of the Bessemer process and detachable collar are gone,
but the Troy area is again at the leading edge of new ideas, he said.
   ``What we're seeing is just a repeat of what happened in Troy in
the last century,'' he said. ``Now we're just on to another era.''
   One firm at the technology park, U.S. Composites, is developing
strong, lightweight composites that may replace steel in auto
production, Wacholder said.
   About 1,000 people work in the 6-year-old park, selected as one
of the country's five top such facilities by the national
Association of University Related Research Parks. Some of the
businesses employ as many as 350 people, while others have only two
or three.
   But the pioneering research each of those companies is doing now
could blossom into major industries, turning today's two-man shop
into tomorrow's 2,000-man shop, Wacholder said.
   Rensselaer County's jobless rate was 4.8 percent in April, vs.
5.6 percent statewide and 5.1 percent nationwide.
   Like most parts of the country, Rensselaer County is seeing a
rise in service sector jobs that generally pay far less than the
manufacturing jobs that have left the area.
   Since 1982, the number of manufacturing jobs has been virtually
unchanged at about 6,600, said Labor Department spokesman James
Ross. Since 1982, the number of service jobs has grown by 25 percent
to 12,635 in March, he said.
   Those service jobs, officials hope, will continue to make up for
the well-paying blue-collar jobs that inevitably disappear. The last
of Troy's textile jobs will be gone in July as Cluett Peabody &amp; Co.,
maker of Arrow shirts, moves its last 385 local jobs to plants in
Georgia.
   Recruiting employees for businesses at the technology park often
involves no more than contacting RPI or nearby Hudson Valley
Community College, which stresses technology programs. Many of the
businesses, including U.S. Composites, were founded by RPI graduates
who set up shop in the area to be near its educational resources.
   Ironically, Sterling says it's moving because Rensselaer County
doesn't have the pool of trained drug researchers and the high-tech
pharmaceutical facilities that Philadelphia and nearby southern New
Jersey offer.
   New York officials shrug off the apparent slap at the area's
research resources.
   ``I think they kind of misspeak when they use that,'' Buono said.
``They want to go to Philly to raid existing pharmaceutical
companies so they can build their staff faster.''
   Unlike the mass pullouts by heavy industry from the Northeast
since the 1960s, Sterling's exodus is an isolated incident that
won't be a big obstacle to creating ``little Silicon Valley,'' local
officials say.
   ``Whenever I heard people talk about businesses moving from the
Northeast to the Sunbelt, I'd say, `This is the brain-belt,''
Wacholder said. ``The brains in the Northeast developed the
technology being used in California and the South. The brain-belt
survives.''

   Paramount Communications Inc. boss Martin S.
Davis showed with a dramatic offer for Time Inc. that the folks who
gave us the ``Indiana Jones'' movies can jolt the takeover world
with some hair-raising stunts.
   Davis waited until there were 2{ weeks left before Time was to
vanish into an embrace with Warner Communications Inc. before
launching Paramount's unsolicited $10.7 billion tender offer for
Time.
   The bid enraged Time executives, sent Wall Streeters into a
speculative buying frenzy and forced Time shareholders to weigh
where their loyalties lay.
   In a stinging letter, Time's chairman and chief executive, J.
Richard Munro, said Davis' bid ``smacks more of spite than
strategy.''
   ``You've changed the name of your corporation but not its
character: it's still `engulf and devour','' Munro wrote his
counterpart at the company that until only recently had been called
Gulf &amp; Western Inc.
   On Friday, Time rejected Paramount's offer and amended its own
merger plan with Warner by offering to pay $70 a share for all of
Warner's stock rather than simply swapping stock in the new company
for Warner's shares.
   Paramount's bid put the normally media-shy Davis in the middle of
a battle for one of the most revered companies in the American media
business. He declined to be interviewed for this story.
   Unlike many entertainment executives, Davis shuns the celebrity
spotlight. He likes riding horses, tinkering with classic cars and
practicing photography, associates say, and lives quietly in
Connecticut's affluent Fairfield County with his second wife, Luella.
   But he can be tough in the boardroom. He was part of a group of
outside directors at RJR Nabsico Inc. who resisted a $17 billion
management-led buyout offer for the company and got shareholders $25
billion instead.
   Davis was born Feb. 5, 1927 in the Bronx. He quit high school but
eventually returned to get his diploma. He started in the
entertainment business as a teen-age office boy for movie mogul
Samuel Goldwyn.
   Later he worked as a publicity agent for the Allied Artists
studio, and joined Paramount Pictures in 1958 as a director of sales
and marketing. He rose to be chief operating officer.
   Gulf &amp; Western acquired Paramount Pictures in 1966 and Davis
moved to the parent company three years later. He was a top
lieutenant to Chairman Charles Bluhdorn.
   Those were the days when conglomerates were fashionable in
corporate America, epitomized by the far-flung corpocracy Bluhdorn
had assembled.
   Gulf &amp; Western owned companies that made cigars, clothes,
bedding, auto parts, hydraulic presses and coin-operated videogames.
It owned sugar-growing operations in the Dominican Republic, a pair
of horse race tracks and a $900 million securities portfolio.
   It also had operations in entertainment, finance and publishing,
and these would form the core of the company after Bluhdorn died of
a heart attack while returning from the Dominican Republic on Feb.
19, 1983.
   The board of directors selected Davis as chief executive over two
other likely successors to Bluhdorn five days later.
   Irwin Schloss, head of the securities firm Marcus Schloss &amp; Co.
Inc. and a Gulf &amp; Western board member for 28 years, said Bluhdorn
had recognized that ``the Street did not appreciate what he had
built and put together'' and had begun the divestment process.
   But Davis accelerated it, presiding over one of the most
extensive corporate dissections ever.
   He liquidated the stock portfolio from March 1983 through 1984.
   In August 1983, the company began selling 50 businesses with
about $1.3 billion in sales that failed to meet Davis' performance
standards. The sales produced about $360 million by 1984.
   Davis sold the sugar-growing business for $200 million in January
1985 and the consumer and electrical products group for about $1
billion that fall. He sold them because they were cyclical, required
substantial capital, or faced intensifying foreign competition.
   Even as the sales were proceeding, Davis began a stock repurchase
program that retired nearly 46 million shares. He bought publishing
companies like the college textbook publisher Prentice-Hall Inc.,
movie theaters. He got the company more heavily involved in cable
and broadcast television.
   The company's stock price is now trading near $60, vs. $9 the day
before Bluhdorn died.
   Its earnings have more than doubled to $384.7 million, or $3.21 a
share, for 1988 compared with $168.6 million, or $1.09 a share, in
1982.
   In April, Davis disclosed plans to sell Associates First Capital
Corp., taking the company out of the financial services business to
concentrate on publishing and entertainment. The sale is expected to
generate $3 billion or more that may be used in the battle for Time.
   Aides said Davis made the choice to stay with publishing and
entertainment because of the long-lasting profit potential of books,
TV and movies.
   Davis points to Paramount's ``Star Trek'' program that enjoyed a
short run on network TV in 1960s, but has spawned books, five
movies, TV syndication revenue and a new syndicated series.
   Securities analysts who follow Paramount had expected Davis to
buy something big following disclosure of plans to sell The
Associates, a step that he has called ``the culmination of a
six-year strategic transformation.''
   They got it with Paramount's $175-a-share bid for Time on June 7,
only 16 days before Time and Warner shareholders were to vote on the
proposed Time Warner merger.
   If Davis succeeds, he'll have a $7.6 billion company bigger than
foreign media giants such as Bertelsmann of Germany, Hachette of
France and News Corp. of Australia.
   The buyout would come at some cost to shareholders. Davis told
securities analysts Paramount would have no earnings for two years
and ``significantly lower'' dividends if the proposed takeover went
through.
   But he said the chance to buy Time represents ``a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to maximize Paramount Communications'
long-term potential.''

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, battling to get airborne again
despite an intractable strike and the shackles of bankruptcy court,
is facing a new and perhaps more insidious problem: allegations of
sloppy maintenance.
   The airline insists these charges are groundless concoctions of
embittered strikers, who have crippled Eastern for nearly four
months.
   But the Federal Aviation Administration is monitoring Eastern's
maintenance situation, an influential congresswoman has expressed
concern to the agency, and sources say a criminal inquiry into the
airline's maintenance record-keeping at two airports is underway.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
the criminal investigation by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office for
the Eastern district of New York focuses on possibly improper
practices and allegedly falsified records at Eastern's John F.
Kennedy International Airport maintenance facility and neighboring
LaGuardia.
   Early last month, Eastern surrendered its repair station
certificate at Kennedy after the FAA determined the carrier had
failed to properly record and inspect maintenance work.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Gerber said he could neither
confirm nor deny a criminal investigation exists. FBI
representatives did not return calls seeking comment.
   Ira J. Furman, an attorney and former deputy director of the
National Transportation Safety Board, said he represents a former
Eastern maintenance manager who has talked to the FAA, FBI and the
U.S. attorney's office about alleged violations that occurred at
least a year ago at LaGuardia.
   The lawyer wouldn't identify his client, who worked at LaGuardia,
but said he has been granted immunity in an investigation of the
violations, in which Furman said falsified records led to
contaminated fuel.
   The spotlight of publicity turned on safety could not come at a
worse time for Miami-based Eastern, battered by bad news for years.
The safety question is especially sensitive because it has arisen
periodically.
   Labor strife at Eastern a year before the strike prompted FAA
inspectors to examine its fleet plane-by-plane, though no
abnormalities were found. Special FAA reviews in 1987 resulted in an
$823,000 fine.
   That followed a $9.5 million penalty stemming from earlier
infractions and warnings from the FAA that Eastern's operating
certificate faced revocation if it didn't clean up what examiners
called a long list of deficiences.
   Eastern documents and memos obtained by The Associated Press
depict an airline in which maintenance crews feuded with
supervisors, disaffected mechanics quit and managers ignored pilot
protests of sloppy repairs.
   ``We need parts!,'' Eastern maintenance manager Charles R.
Seymour pleaded in one internal memo in March 1987 to Phil Bohan,
vice president of line maintenance. ``I can assure you that the lack
of parts is seriously affecting our performance and continuing to
erode our manpower.''
   Seymour, director of Eastern's maintenance base in Atlanta until
he quit early this year, also complained to superiors about an
``alarming exodus'' of maintenance staff and other problems in memos
from July 1986 to January 1989.
   In an April 1988 letter, Carlos Diaz, principal maintenance
inspector in the FAA's Miami office, told Edward Upton, Eastern's
vice president of maintenance and engineering, that an informal
inspection of a Miami repair station had revealed ``far-reaching
findings.''
   The deficiencies included failure to separate usable parts from
``condemned'' ones and failure to follow procedures for handling
parts outlined in Eastern's manual, Diaz told Upton.
   ``Management personnel are unfamiliar with repair station
operational procedures'' and ``general housekeeping policy (is) not
being adhered to by Eastern personnel,'' Diaz wrote.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House
subcommittee on Government Activities and Transportation, has
expressed concern to acting FAA Administrator Robert E. Whittington
that shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering Eastern's
ability to maintain its fleet.
   In a June 1 letter to Whittington, Collins said her
subcommittee's staff had reviewed internal company documents
indicating ``manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the
maintenance function of Eastern.''
   On May 12, the FAA completed a special investigation of
record-keeping at Eastern's maintenance posts in Miami and Atlanta,
to determine if violations of record-keeping rules such as those
found at Kennedy were widespread.
   The three airports are home to Eastern's principal maintenance
facilities. The final report hasn't been submitted to Whittington.
But Jack Barker, FAA spokesman in Atlanta, said the agency told
Eastern informally that the inspection had revealed no
irregularities.
   At the same time, the FAA is continuing a ``special
surveillance'' of Eastern's overall safety, which began when workers
struck the airline March 4, said FAA spokesman Fred Farrar in
Washington.
   Suspension of the Kennedy certificate was for actions that
predated the strike, which pushed Eastern into bankruptcy court.
   When a maintenance certificate is suspended, the airline cannot
work on planes at the facility. It must contract work to others or
ferry planes elsewhere until deficiencies at the facility are
corrected.
   Questions about Eastern's Kennedy operation and maintenance
practices in general are like open sores in the airline's struggle
to sidestep the strikers, hire replacements and woo a skeptical
public back to the ticket counter.
   Unionists accuse the company of ``pencil-whipping,'' a reference
to maintenance supervisors signing off on aircraft repairs that
weren't done.
   They also charge that management, frantically trying to cut costs
and honor flying schedules during the pre-strike months, bullied
mechanics and pilots who complained about serious maintenance
violations.
   ``It all has root in a corporate culture, a corporate attitude,''
Greg Petachenko, an Eastern pilot for 22 years, said in a telephone
interview. ``Their basic tool seems to have been fear and
intimidation ... There's enormous pressure to keep your mouth shut,
do what you're told.''
   Until recently, Eastern paid maintenance supervisors bonuses for
meeting deadlines. The company stresses, however, that supervisors
also received bonuses for meeting training requirements and repair
quality standards.
   For its part, Eastern charges some machinists hid or destroyed
maintenance records at Kennedy, then told the FAA that company
supervisors neglected to have necessary work performed.
   Company representatives discovered records hidden in file
cabinets and stuffed under sofa cushions in union areas at the
airport, said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
   ``We've never dispatched an unsafe plane; we have one of the best
safety records in the industry,'' Matell said. He called union
complaints ``a deliberate attempt to drive away our passengers and
weaken the company.''
   The safety questions haven't stopped Frank Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., from proceeding with a plan to
rebuild Eastern into a smaller carrier and sell around $1.8 billion
of assets.
   The plan must be approved by federal bankruptcy court. But U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland already has given Eastern
permission to sell its Northeast shuttle service to developer Donald
Trump for $365 million.
   At the same time, Eastern has been aggressively recruiting new
skilled mechanics to replace strikers. The move complements a more
highly-publicized drive to recruit new pilots.
   The airline recently ran help-wanted advertisements for qualified
mechanics in newspapers in New Orleans, Dallas, Atlanta, Denver,
Miami, Tampa, West Palm Beach and Pensacola. The ads offer
``exciting career opportunities'' and wages of $10 to $18 an hour.
   Before the strike, unionized mechanics at Eastern earned top
hourly pay of $18.83. That compares with $16 at sister Texas Air
carrier Continental, $18.78 at American, $20.05 at United and
Northwest, and $20.10 at Delta and USAir.
   ``We're certainly putting a lot of attention on recruiting
mechanics,'' Matell said.

   Elaine Witherite keeps a 3-foot-tall furry
cloth cow on her lawn because it's good for business. The yard art
business.
   On sale next door at Ron's IGA, which she owns with her husband,
are furry Holsteins, bird baths, ornamental glass balls and concrete
figurines in the form of 3{-foot-tall deer, elves and Chinese lions.
   Ron's IGA, where sales of lawn decorations have doubled in each
of the last three years, is on the cutting edge of American culture.
   ``Yard art is being adopted by a wider range of classes,''
including yuppies, said Anne Marie Thigpen, a lecturer at Penn State
University who is writing a book titled ``Outdoor Decor.''
   Even the plastic pink flamingo _ long considered the king of
kitsch _ has migrated from ethnic, working class neighborhoods to
well-groomed suburbs, she said.
   ``The pink flamingo is so blatantly kitsch, it's the only thing
that's safe to use,'' Mrs. Thigpen said.
   Yuppies who can't quite stomach pink flamingos have altered
existing lawn ornaments to meet their upscale sensibilities, she
said. ``Instead of a plastic duck, they have a bronze crane.''
   National retail chains and mail order catalogues have moved to
meet the growing demand for yard art.
   W. Atlee Burpee &amp; Co., the nation's oldest seed company, in the
past two years ago has started offering decorative garden
accessories in its catalog.
   ``We sell mostly something that has function to it,'' said Eileen
Kearney, merchandise manager at Burpee, headquartered in Warminster.
   Burpee offers brass duck faucet heads and swan-shaped hose
guides, which are spikes to keep hoses from being pulled over
gardens.
   K mart Corp. has long sold lawn ornaments but has experienced a
surge in sales in the last three years, said Stephen Pagnani,
marketing coordinator at the company's headquarters in Troy, Mich.
   Yard art may be ``just something else to mow around,'' in Mrs.
Witherite's words, but the money is good. She said Ron's IGA sold 10
black bears after dinnertime one night recently for $29.95 each.
   Mrs. Thigpen has been researching lawn ornaments for more than
three years, studying yard art in California and in the East from
Quebec to Florida.
   Giant butterflies have given way in the East to eye-catching wood
or plastic backsides of men and women. In the West, she said, donkey
cart planters are very popular.
   Surprisingly, she said, ersatz flamingos are popular in Florida,
where the real birds exists, and mock deer and cows are popular in
areas such as Pennsylvania, where the animals thrive.
   ``People really tend to reinforce their environment with these
things,'' she said.
   In her yard several miles from Penn State's campus, Mrs. Thigpen
has wagon wheels, flamingos and a wind-powered ``whirly gig,'' which
shows a small wooden man milking a small wooden cow.
   Mrs. Thigpen said homeowners decorate their lawn to show their
individuality.
   ``It's a way to say, `This place is mine,''' she said.

<BYLINE>Time Responds to Paramount Bid with $14 Billion Offer for Warner</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Eds: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>

   Paramount Communications Inc. says it is pressing
ahead with its $10.7 billion unsolicited bid for Time Inc. although
Time has rejected Paramount's proposal and announced its own $14
billion tender offer for Warner Communications Inc.
   Most observers said the offer announced Friday complicated the
struggle for Time, which is trying to preserve the merger with
Warner announced in March.
   Time outlined a two-stage tender offer under which it would pay
$70 a share in cash for 100 million Warner shares in a tender offer
and then exchange $70 a share in cash and securities for the
remaining 100 million shares of Warner stock.
   Time stock slumped $9 to $162.50 a share in New York Stock
Exchange consolidated trading Friday, Warner rose $3.62{ to $59.25 a
share and Paramount fell $1.37{ to $58.12{.
   Analysts said there was still speculation on Wall Street that the
Paramount bid might succeed and that prevented Time stock from
falling further.
   Time's rejection of the Paramount $175-a-share bid _ which ended
10 days of silence on the offer _ said it was not in the best
interests of Time because the bid was financially inadequate and
highly conditional.
   Time officials said they anticipated a higher offer from
Paramount, but they believed Paramount still would ultimately fail
because its offer was conditioned on acquiring rights to some 800
cable system franchises that Time now holds.
   Time President Nicholas J. Nicholas said in an interview Friday
there has never been a hostile takeover of a cable franchise and he
predicted Paramount would be unable to operate the systems and
therefore would not have the assets needed to secure its takeover
debt.
   ``If you can't get hold of the assets, you can't get hold of the
bank loan,'' he said.
   Time officials also said they were betting stockholders would not
want to wait for Paramount to complete the regulatory process, which
Time estimated could take as long as a year.
   Some observers have cautioned that the bid for Warner could open
the company up to a higher bid by a third party. But Warner Chairman
Steven Ross discounted that possibility Friday.
   Paramount called Time's bid for Warner ``a defensive device, pure
and simple.''
   ``From the standpoint of Time shareholders, we don't see how it
begins to compare with our offer of $175 a share in cash for all
share,'' Paramount stated.
   Industry analysts have said the stock price of a combined
Time-Warner is unlikely to rise to the $175-a-share level for two
years. Nicholas vehemently disagreed, and said the combined cash
flow of a Time-Warner would be high enough to improve the stock's
value.
   A bid for Warner widely had been seen as a possible defensive
action by Time, but analysts said it did little to resolve the fight.
   Fred Anschel of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said the bid fails to
specify the exact breakdown of the cash and securities in the second
tier of the buyout and did not adequately explain how the deal would
be financed.
   However, Nicholas, Ross and Time Chairman J. Richard Munro said
in an interview that the Time-Warner cash flow would be enough to
service the debt resulting from the merger.
   Time and Warner also announced Friday they had carried out a
stock swap provided for under their earlier merger agreement. The
stock swap was intended to defend an unsolicited bid for either
company.
   Time also sued to block Paramount from taking any steps ``to
disrupt the merger'' of Time and Warner Communications Inc.
   The suit, filed at federal court in Manhattan, alleged Paramount
violated securities laws and sought a preliminary injunction to
prevent Paramount from trying to acquire Time stock and ``making or
attempting to make any tender offer'' for Time's securities.
   The lawsuit alleged that Paramount made false and misleading
statements in its tender offer.
   Paramount's statement called the suit ``a continuation of the
publicity campaign Time has been waging.''
   Paul Alexandrakis, an analyst with Argus Research Inc., said he
expected shareholders to determine the outcome of the fight _ either
by tendering their shares or in formal votes.
   However, Alexandrakis said, ``You might wonder why someone would
tender to Time rather than Paramount at this point with the
divergence in price.''
   Time and Warner agreed in March to merge in an all-stock deal
under which Time stockholders would get a share in the new company,
Time-Warner Inc., for each Time share while Warner shareholders
would get 0.465 of a share of the new company for each of their
Warner shares.
   Paramount, formerly called Gulf &amp; Western Inc., announced its bid
for Time on June 6, just 2{ weeks before Time and Warner
shareholders were to vote on the proposed merger. The tender offer
was formally launched the next day.
   Time and Warner did not immediately say whether their shareholder
meetings, scheduled for June 23, would take place.

   The revisions in the merger agreement between
Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. would leave the new company
laden with more debt and Warner shareholders facing potential tax
liabilities.
   But the companies say even they don't know how much that debt
burden would be because they have not yet worked out the second
phase of Time's proposed two-step buyout of Warner's stock.
   The latest plan was announced Friday, in an attempt to thwart a
hostile $175 a share buyout offer from Paramount Communications Inc.
that values Time at $10.7 billion.
   In their original merger plan disclosed March 4, Time
shareholders would have received one new share in the new company
for each Time share and Warner shareholders would get 0.465 shares
in the new company for every Warner share.
   The resulting company would have had about 150 million shares.
   But Time president N.J. Nicholas Jr. said the marketplace
indicated _ through Time's stock price _ it was unhappy with the
terms of that agreement.
   ``It was telling us, `You didn't do the right deal','' he said in
an interview.
   In the past 10 days, the Time and Warner boards negotiated a
revision in the merger agreement that call for Time to make a tender
offer for Warner.
   Under that plan, Time will offer $70 a share for 100 million of
Warner's approximately 200 million shares.
   That portion of the deal would cost $7 billion, and Warner
shareholders who may have acquired their stock for less than $70 a
share would face a potential capital gains tax liability upon
tendering their shares.
   In the second phase of the deal, each remaining Warner share will
be converted for an as-yet unspecified combination of cash, stock or
debt.
   Both phases of the Warner buyout would cost a total of about $14
billion. Warner would also bring $1 billion in debt to the new
company, boosting the total value of the merger to about $15 billion.
   The companies said a bank group led by Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. and Bankers Trust Co. already have committed to provide $1.5
billion for the deal and have said they can arrange up $14 billion
in additional financing.
   Time and Warner also said their combined cash flow after a merger
would be adequate to service their debt load.
   If the second phase of the deal excludes issuance of new stock,
Time would be left with about 57 million shares, the same as it has
now.
   But Warner and Time officials hope that the market will value the
Time shares more highly because the new company will have a
substantially broader asset base.
