   A couple who reported their 7-year-old son
missing were charged Monday with child abuse after the bruised and
malnourished boy was found on a subway car with cigarette burns and
black eyes, police said.
   Rene Samacarit, 28, and Zorida Maldonado, 31, of Brooklyn were
charged with second-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a
minor, said police spokesman Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   The couple reported the boy missing at 2:30 p.m. Less than half
an hour later, Transit Police found the malnourished and beaten
child on a subway in Manhattan, O'Donnell said.
   The boy, who had run away from home, was taken to St. Vincent's
Hospital with multiple injuries, including cigarette burns, bruises,
black eyes, a throat infection and malnutrition, O'Donnell said.
   His parents identified him at the hospital and were charged
following an investigation, O'Donnell said.
   The boy's 3-year-old sister has been turned over to the Bureau of
Child Welfare, O'Donnell said.
   The children's names were not released.

   When Donald Kowalski retired from the
backbreaking life of a miner on Minnesota's Iron Range, he looked
forward to years of peace and leisure.
   Instead, the 58-year-old Kowalski and his wife, Della, are
spending their golden years at war with a lesbian professor over who
should care for their severely brain-damaged daughter, Sharon.
   The professor, Karen Thompson, says she deserves to be Ms.
Kowalski's caretaker because the two secretly considered themselves
married before Ms. Kowalski was paralyzed in a 1983 automobile crash
caused by a drunken driver.
   Kowalski and his wife say the claim is bogus. They insist
Thompson's interest in their daughter centers on money Thompson has
generated by publicizing the case in speeches across the country and
a book.
   ``I hate her with a passion,'' Kowalski said from his home in
rural Nashwauk in northeastern Minnesota. ``I can't picture an end
to this.''
   Thompson says the money is intended to help Ms. Kowalski, and she
questions her parents' motives. ``They would rather she be a
vegetable than a lesbian,'' she said. ``Until Sharon's rights are
protected, I will fight this.''
   Thompson, who has become a national spokeswoman for gay and
lesbian rights, has helped establish two funds for her friend and
organized rallies in 21 U.S. cities in August to observe ``Free
Sharon Kowalski Day.''
   According to court records, the two women had lived together for
four years. Ms. Kowalski, 32, who was a high school physical
education teacher, had named Thompson, 41, as the beneficiary of her
$50,000 life insurance policy before the accident.
   The courts have acknowledged the relationship but have kept
Kowalski as his daughter's guardian, giving him power to make
decisions for her and initially allowing him to deny Thompson
visiting privileges.
   But in December, a judge ordered a re-evaluation of Ms. Kowalski
to determine how soundly she thinks and whether she is capable of
making decisions about her own care.
   Ms. Kowalski, who is in a nursing home near Nashwauk, has lost
the use of her limbs and is unable to speak but can use the fingers
of her right hand and communicates by typing, shaking her head and
using an alphabet board.
   Under the judge's new order, anyone is allowed to see her if she
``reliably requested'' to see them. Ms. Thompson said she was
granted supervised visits because Ms. Kowalski asked to see her in
interviews with a psychiatrist.
   A week ago, the two visited over four days for the first time in
3{ years.
   ``I think Sharon is soon going to let everyone know that she can
control her own future,'' Thompson said from Ms. Kowalski's bedside.
``She smiles and she chuckles and she has responded so well. She's
been happy to see me.''
   After the re-evaluation, the judge could go as far as declaring
Ms. Kowalski competent to handle her own affairs, but her parents
say such a finding would be impossible. They say Thompson has
exaggerated Ms. Kowalski's mental abilities and her chances for
rehabilitation.
   ``We're never going to have the real Sharon Kowalski back,'' said
her mother. ``You might get a good response from Sharon one day and
the next day _ nothing. It would take a miracle to see her recover.''
   Thompson, who teaches physical education at St. Cloud State
University, said Ms. Kowalski wants to go home with her to St.
Cloud; the Kowalskis say their daughter has never expressed that
desire to them.
   Thompson said she could provide better care for Ms. Kowalski
because she has more talent and education than her parents.
   ``I made a lifetime commitment to Sharon, and I want to honor
that,'' Thompson said.
   Ms. Kowalski's doctor, William Wilson, opposes moving her from
the nursing home. He said home care would be out of the question
because Thompson is not certified to care for someone as severely
disabled as Ms. Kowalski.
   Meanwhile, Thompson admits she has started other relationships.
   ``I have found that there are several people in the world that I
can have relationships with,'' Thompson said. ``But I don't know if
I can fall deeply in love with another person like I did with
Sharon.''
   Kowalski and Thompson say they are likely to be battling each
other as long as Ms. Kowalski is judged incapable of handling her
own affairs.
   ``If this keeps up I probably don't have much time left,'' said
Kowalski, who has suffered two heart attacks in the past year that
he attributes to the stress. ``My heart can only take so much.''

   Thousands of people prayed for rain in northern
Italian churches and some parched communities planned religious
processions, hoping to bring an end to one of the worst droughts in
years.
   At 1,300 Roman Catholic churches in the diocese of Milan on
Sunday, priests invoked ``the rain that restores the earth and
air,'' according to the diocese.
   Churchgoers in Bergamo and Genoa have also been praying for rain
as sunny, dry weather threatens crops and left ski slopes bare.
   Several parishes in small towns south of Milan were planning
processions along the Adda river if rain did not arrive in the next
few days, the Italian news agency ANSA reported Sunday.
   Italy has received only half the precipitation it usually gets in
the September-January period. The Milan area has had one rain shower
since November 24, while Genoa has been dry for four months.
   The lack of rain has prompted limits on private water use and
contributed to brush fires that have scorched thousands of acres in
northern Italy.
   The dry weather is the result of a high-pressure system that has
remained over the Mediterranean for months, meteorologists say.

<TEXT>
   In returning Michael Manley to power,
Jamaicans opted for a new style of leadership, decisively rejecting
the tough economic solutions and autocratic demeanor of conservative
incumbent Edward Seaga.
   The island also emerged from its short but tense election
campaign with an improved record on controlling political violence.
   Preliminary indications were that the charismatic Manley, a
radical-turned-moderate leader with a new pro-business image, won 44
of 60 seats in Parliament in Thursday's voting.
   Jamaica's leading political analyst and pollster, Carl Stone of
the University of the West Indies, said he thought there would be no
fundamental policy shifts under Manley, who was prime minister from
1972 to 1980.
   ``There will be the same policies, but a different style of
leadership,'' Stone said. ``He really feels obsessed with correcting
his mismanagement during the 1970s.''
   Seaga, a technocrat and hard-nosed manager, was regarded as a
friend of big business, which is wary of Manley.
   ``There definitely are going to be memories of what happened in
the past,'' said Peter Thwaites, president of the Private Sector
Organization of Jamaica, the country's main business group. But he
said if Manley carries out his current proposals, ``there will be
very little change in the economic policies of the country.''
   Manley appropriated private farms and heavily taxed business
during his previous government. Now, he says he has ``abandoned all
thoughts of nationalization'' and wants to give private enterprise a
free hand in developing the economy.
   Seaga improved the island's economy, especially tourism, but he
did it by doubling the foreign debt to about $4 billion, raising
taxes, laying off thousands of workers and cutting back spending on
health and education.
   Prices rose sharply, leading to food riots in 1985.
   ``The program he (Seaga) has carried out has been very rigid,''
said Stone. ``And he's paying the price for it.''
   Seaga, a staunch ally of the United States and close political
friend of Ronald Reagan, said he was afraid the results of his
economic measures had not reached enough people.
   ``You see the results, yes, but the results have not reached
enough people, (so) that enough people will say `Yes, well, we took
the medicine and we've benefited,''' he said recently.
   He said he was forced to take unpopular measures because of the
near-bankrupt state of the economy when he took office in 1980 after
eight years of Manley rule and the collapse of the bauxite industry
in 1983.
   He said younger voters had no memories of how bad things were
under Manley.
   Manley, known by his most ardent supporters as ``Joshua'' after
the Old Testament prophet, pledged to revitalize schools and
hospitals he said were neglected for eight years under Seaga's
cost-cutting administration.
   As prime minister, Manley gained an international reputation as a
firebrand socialist. He forged close ties with Cuba's Fidel Castro
and brought in scores of Cuban doctors and technicians.
   In recent years, he has turned sharply to the political center as
a social democrat. The 64-year-old leader has been saying he is an
older and wiser man, and on election night Thursday he thanked the
Jamaican people for giving him a ``second chance.''
   Manley said he would restore relations with Cuba but was more
interested in working with the Bush administration and Western
lending institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank.
   He said his first foreign trip as prime minister will be to
Washington to establish ``the widest and most constructive''
relationship possible with the new administration.
   The Bush administration won't be pleased that Manley is reopening
the Cuban Embassy, which was closed by Seaga, but U.S. officials say
they are encouraged by Manley's pledge to limit the Cuban presence
and influence to formal diplomatic ties.
   Policy issues were overshadowed during the campaign by fears that
bloodshed among rival political supporters would further split the
nation of 2.4 million and wreck tourism, which brings in $600
million a year and is Jamaica's top earner of foreign exchange.
   The tourism industry still is recovering from a sharp drop in
visitors in the aftermath of Hurricane Gilbert, which slammed into
the island Sept. 12, killing 45 people and causing $1 billion in
damage.
   In 1980, when Jamaica's last nationally contested election was
held, an estimated 700 people were murdered over a nine-month
campaign. This time, 13 died in campaign-related shootings and
stabbings.
   But in comparison with the mayhem of 1980, the election appeared
to mark a turning point in Jamaican politics.

<TEXT>
   The gunfire has stopped, the dictator
is gone and the celebrating is over. Paraguayans now must get down
to the business of adjusting to life without the only president most
of them have ever known.
   On the surface, the future looks brighter for this South American
nation of nearly 4 million _ holding promises of new leadership and
perhaps a more representative government.
   The likelihood that another general will replace ousted leader
Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, now in exile in neighboring Brazil, bothers
few Paraguayans.
   Neither does the certainty that political power will remain in
the hands of the ruling Colorado Party, a pillar of Stroessner's
support throughout his nearly 35 years in power.
   ``It doesn't make any difference what kind of government we get,
it has to be better than the one we had,'' said 20-year-old Celso
Gonzalez, one of the thousands of citizens who went into the street
to celebrate the fall of the 76-year-old dictator.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, whose tanks and troops ousted Stroessner
in a violent coup Feb. 3, seems to be many things his predecessor
was not.
   Rodriguez quickly dissolved Congress and called for elections May
1 in which all parties _ except the Communists _ can participate. He
promised to respect human rights, freedom of expression and the
Roman Catholic Church.
   He named an 11-man Cabinet that even opposition members
grudgingly admit includes Paraguay's most successful and talented
administrators and technocrats.
   The new government will have to deal with urgent problems,
including poverty, economic stagnation, 30 percent annual inflation
and a foreign debt of nearly $2 billion.
   The church, which had become a leading opposition body in this
predominantly Roman Catholic nation, promised the new president its
support.
   Rodriguez, 65, has denied rumors he may be linked to drug
traffickers who move cocaine through Paraguay, and he pledged to
cooperate with the United States and international agencies seeking
to end the drug trade.
   In Paraguay's first presidential press conference, the affable,
self-assured cavalry general left open the possibility he may run
for president.
   ``I am simply a soldier, not a politician,'' Rodriguez told
reporters. ``However, if I can be useful to my country, I will do
what I am asked.''
   Luis Maria Argana, the new foreign minister who was seen as the
party's most likely presidential choice, quickly denied reports he
would run and endorsed Rodriguez.
   The Colorado Party, which claims membership of 1.4 million and
has ruled since 1947, has said it will call a convention soon to
select candidates and new party leaders.
   The 101-year-old party was badly split in August 1987 when a
small but fanatical pro-Stroessner group usurped party leadership in
a battle over how to prepare for post-Stroessner rule.
   The Stroessner backers, an inner circle of militant government
and party officials, favored continuation of hard-line authoritarian
rule, possibly under Stroessner's eldest son, Gustavo, an air force
colonel.
   The majority, calling themselves ``traditionalists,'' favored
some relaxation of iron rule and the eventual replacement of
Stroessner with a civilian president.
   Recently, the situation was complicated by Stroessner's failing
health. The nation, accustomed to seeing his picture every day in
the newspapers, was astounded in September when he vanished for two
weeks for an unannounced prostate operation.
   In a nation where virtually every decision was made by the
president, the wheels of government ground to a halt.
   ``The president used to personally sign most government
documents,'' said a foreign diplomat. ``Some of our transferring
personnel even received shipment orders for their household goods
signed by him.''
   Rodriguez's decision to act, diplomats and politicians say, came
when Stroessner ordered him to give up command of the powerful First
Army Corps and retire, or accept a political post, possibly defense
minister, without command of troops.
   Stroessner's downfall sent citizens _ 70 percent of whom had
known only Stroessner as president _ into the streets to celebrate.
Rival politicians, bitter enemies for years, embraced, danced and
sang.
   The nation's opposition political parties face new problems. Most
were unrecognized because they had not been allowed to participate
in the political process.
   ``The hinges of our political limbs are rusty from lack of use,''
said Euclides Acevedo, president of the left-leaning Revolutionary
Febrerista Party.
   Domingo Laino, popular head of the National Accord, a loose
grouping of four opposition parties, suggested the opposition needs
``as much as a year'' to organize to effectively compete with the
Colorados in elections.
   Political leaders largely discount the possibility that
Stroessner or his son Gustavo could effectively organiize any effort
to return to power.
   Stroessner supporters were hard to find after the coup and they
spoke with reluctance.
   ``I have to admit that I don't think that Stroessner was all
bad,'' said a taxi driver as he drove through streets of happy
demonstrators following the coup. ``He gave us peace and he built
schools for our children and roads where there were only mudholes
before.''
   ``Look at those people,'' he said, nodding toward the
demonstrators. ``If Stroessner were still in power, most of them
would be cheering for him instead of Rodriguez.''

   Two men who dressed and behaved

   The Star said Ismail Awang, 31, and Amdan Osman, 42, were the

Kedah state.
   Under the law, a transvestite caught in a public place can be
fined up to 1,000 ringgits ($366) or jailed for six months. The two
men each paid $183 fines in lieu of spending four months in jail.
   The two were caught in a raid by Religious Affairs Department

   The two were wearing skirts and T-shirts and were soliciting when
arrested, the paper said.

   When your name is Herbert Hoover, you have
to have a sense of humor. Just ask him.
   ``I remember once I needed a reservation at a Washington, D.C.,
hotel and I called and made it in my name,'' Herbert Hoover said
recently.
   ``But when I showed up, they had no reservation. They thought it
had been a prank call. ...
   ``You can't take it seriously or your life would be miserable,''
said Hoover, who works for the Nebraska Technical Assistance Center.
   Hoover was born in Mississippi in 1931 during his namesake's
presidential administration. Given his name, it's only natural he
once bought a pickup truck from a man named Warren Harding (not the
29th president), and that his office mate when he worked for the
U.S. Department of Agriculture at the University of Missouri was
Oliver Wendell Holmes (not the former U.S. Supreme Court Justice).
   He said most people have forgotten former president Hoover, but
many kid him about the Hoover vacuum cleaner.
   ``You have to get used to people laughing at you,'' he said.
   ``My name shocks people,'' Hoover said, ``so I started saying
Herb over the phone. But a few years ago, Burger King had an
advertising campaign featuring a guy named Herb and I started
finding `Where's Herb?' posters all over my office.''
   Although he hasn't changed his name, Hoover has given his son a
different start.
   ``My son's name is Michael,'' Hoover said. ``I would never do
that (name him Herbert). Children have enough to worry about.''

   North Carolina sweet potato growers have
an identity crisis on their hands.
   Just last month, they finally got rid of the name ``yam'' from
the name of their trade group to make a distinction between their
product and the related African tuber. The state grows no yams, but
its $60 million crop represents 40 percent of the nation's sweet
potatoes.
   Now the federal government has decided sweet potato is really one
word: sweetpotato. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is apparently
worried that consumers might think a sweet potato is an Irish potato
that's sweet.
   ``That's the government bureaucracy for you,'' grumbled Milton
Horne, a salesman for Corbett Farms in Wilmington.
   The USDA wants the state's growers, and their trade group, to go
along. The N.C. Sweetpotato Commission has agreed, says Billy
Yeargin, executive director of the group.
   But the Sweet Potato Council of the United States, a
Washington-based grower group, stands by its spelling.
   ``Just because the USDA does it that way means North Carolina
does also,'' said director Howard Hoecker, noting with pride: ``But
we at the council do not.''
   North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture Jim Graham doesn't see
what all the fuss is about.
   ``To heck with how you spell it,'' Graham said in an interview
with The Charlotte Observer. ``We'll spell it any way they want as
long as people are buying them.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Senate `Old Boy Club' in Disarray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate's ``old-boy club,'' which for
generations has cheered on former senators if they advanced into the
upper reaches of the executive branch, has come unglued under the
weight of former Sen. John Tower's nomination to be secretary of
defense.
   Tower's Senate confirmation is in serious jeopardy, the nominee
battered by unproven accusations of heavy drinking, womanizing and
lack of objectivity when it comes to defense contractors.
   Many had expected that Tower's nomination to be the nation's
defense chief would enjoy an effortless slide down a carefully
greased chute.
   Tower, after all, had been one of the powers of the Senate where
he served for two dozen years and presided as chairman of the Armed
Services Committee _ the same panel now being asked to confirm him.
   If he expected special treatment, he didn't get it.
   Instead, his nomination became snared in a web of allegations and
FBI investigations.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the current Armed Services chairman, had
made clear months before last fall's election that he intended to
subject new nominees for top Pentagon positions to intense scrutiny
in an effort to improve the quality of key officials.
   ``I said several times that it wasn't going to be an old-boy
hearing, that we were going to have a thorough review.'' Nunn says.
``The presumption that it was going to be something less was wrong
from the beginning. Period.''
   Nunn calls the Tower screening ``the most exhaustive process and
investigation anyone's gone through in my memory in the Senate.''
   ``I think everybody thought that the old-boy network would work
as it always has and John Tower would go sailing through, but it
hasn't worked that way,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., the Armed
Services Committee's second-ranking Democrat.
   Many members, including Nunn, speak of the process of sifting and
judging the merits of allegations against Tower in terms of personal
pain.
   The pain is evidently more intense against the backdrop of a
courtly, clubby institution in which members routinely refer to
colleagues as ``distinguished'' and ``honorable'' and hasten to
smooth over the wounds of legislative combat with flowery
compliments.
   ``This is a painful process,'' Nunn says. ``It's painful for the
nominee, painful for the president, painful for the committee and
painful for me. It's frustrating. It's not enjoyable.''
   In part, Tower's troubles may stem from the fact that he
apparently entered the confirmation process with a relatively low
reservoir of good will among his former colleagues.
   Many senators say privately that they were not fond of what they
say was Tower's testy temper and autocratic operating style.
   Few are willing to say that in public _ but some are.
   ``Tower is a former member of the Senate. But it is probably also
the case that he doesn't have a lot of intimate friends here or any
aura of popularity or good will,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee at the
time Tower headed Armed Services.
   ``He is not necessarily a person who ingratiates himself with
anybody,'' Lugar said.
   Some Republican senators are saying that while they remain
publicly supportive of the Tower nomination, it is more out of a
sense of loyalty to President Bush, rather than out of any sense of
loyalty or affection toward Tower.
   ``They are saying, `we owe it to the president, not Tower,'''
Lugar said.
   ``I don't notice anything clubby in this one at all,'' he said.
   The question inevitably is raised of whether the Tower nomination
is being hammered by old-fashioned partisan politics.
   Some Republican operatives are saying exactly that, accusing the
Democrats who control the Senate of causing difficulties for the new
administration in part to assert their majority status, and in part
as an expression of frustration over their party's defeat in last
year's presidential contest.
   Not so, says Nunn, whose own credentials are hardly those of a
left-wing Pentagon basher. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former
secretary of the Navy and the panel's ranking Republican, backs him
up.
   The two lawmakers say they have worked as 50-50 partners
throughout the hearings and investigations and constantly shared
information.
   ``Sam Nunn has been fair, equitable and _ steadfastly _ he has
been non-political,'' Warner said late last week.
   Warner said he put the question of fairness directly to Tower
himself.
   ``I said, `John, if you were in the position Sam Nunn and I now
find ourselves in ... would you do it any differently?'''
   The answer?
   ``Sen. Tower looked us right in the eye and said, `No,''' Warner
said.

   The Soviets are bending over backwards to
comply with the treaty calling for destruction of all
intermediate-range missiles, a sign that they are eager for a more
sweeping pact to slash nuclear arsenals, says the chief U.S.
inspector.
   ``The whole thing is going a whole lot better than we expected,''
said Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, who in 19 previous years of dealing
with the Soviets had found little reason to love them.
   Lajoie, 52, has served two stints as a military attache in Moscow
and was commander of the U.S. liaison office in East Germany in 1985
when Soviet soldiers shot and killed American Maj. Arthur Nicholson.
   ``Each of us has some unpleasant little anecdote,'' said Lajoie,
whose face was smashed when the truck in which he was riding was
rammed from behind by a Red Army vehicle in East Germany five months
after the Nicholson incident.
   But, says Lajoie, ``we are professional officers.''
   And ``there is a political will on both sides to make this thing
work. But I am under no political pressure to whitewash the
process,'' Lajoie said in an interview.
   He said the Soviets clearly view verification of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty as a foundation
for cooperation on the more ambitious Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty _ START _ to cut long-range superpower weapons by 30 to 50
percent. START talks are stalled while the Bush administration
reviews overall U.S. policy.
   START, said Lajoie, ``is going to be much more complicated'' to
verify because the number of weapons involved is much larger and
because it calls for reduction rather than elimination of specific
systems.
   Overhead satellites will remain the backbone of U.S.
verification, said Lajoie, but like the INF pact, START calls for
on-site inspections on demand at dozens of locations in the United
States, Western Europe and the Soviet bloc.
   Under the INF regime, the United States also is allowed to keep
30 inspectors outside a Soviet mobile missile plant in Votkinsk, 700
miles east of Moscow, while the Soviets leave a similar group in
Magna, Utah.
   Lajoie and the other 250 Americans assigned to the inspection
agency consult regularly with the START negotiators, and some of the
military officers on the START team have accompanied the INF
inspectors on their rounds to make sure that lessons are learned.
   ``There are certain minor provisions for which we would prefer
different wording,'' said Lajoie, noting a requirement that
inspectors tour a facility within one hour of arrival, no matter
what time they get there.
   Since Lajoie supervised the creation of the On-Site Inspection
Agency in April 1988, the Soviets have destroyed 30.8 percent of
their 1,836 short- and medium-range missiles, and the United States
has destroyed 30.5 percent of its 867 Pershing 2 and ground-launched
cruise missiles.
   ``We're both a little ahead of the curve'' for the three-year
destruction period, said Lajoie. The treaty, negotiated over six
years and signed in December 1987, bans ground-launched superpower
missiles with ranges of 300-3,000 miles.
   He acknowledges that there have been ``a lot of minor glitches.
They have been resolved in a gentlemanly way. There is a tradition
now of resolving these at the lowest possible level.''
   One glitch cannot be blamed on the Soviets, said Lajoie. An X-ray
machine to be used at Votkinsk has not been delivered yet, forcing
the Americans to rely on their eyes to spot any medium-range SS-20
missiles the Soviets might try to sneak out of the factory among
longer range SS-25's.
   Last month, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a conservative opponent of
arms control, accused the Soviets of preventing use of the X-ray
device and therefore violating the treaty.
   LaJoie, however, said, ``it is not a Soviet-imposed delay.''
   If the Americans are suspicious, said Lajoie, they can always
demand to inspect the inside of the missile canister, a right they
can exercise eight times a year. The treaty bans all SS-20 missiles.
   Lajoie, who spent much of his time as a military attache peering
at the outside of Soviet bases under the suspicious gaze of Russian
counterintelligence agents, marvels at the ``unique access'' his
team is given on strategic rocket bases.
   ``Everything we have observed is something we haven't observed
before,'' he said.
   But that's not a license to spy.
   ``Neither side wants the other to move into a sensitive area with
a lot of gear,'' said Lajoie. Each team is allowed to carry only one
camera, a quick-developing model to photograph disputed items.
   Since completion of ``baseline'' inspections last summer to
verify the actual number of weapons in each arsenal, only one
photograph has been taken, by the Soviets, of a ground-launched
cruise missile that already had been partially disassembled, a minor
deviation from protocol, according to an administration official.
   Another small misunderstanding arose after an American failed to
count one item on a list of weapons components to be destroyed. The
misunderstanding was cleared up quickly through an exchange of
telegrams, according to the official, who spoke on condition he not
be further identified.

   Former Gov. Orval Faubus sold memorabilia
from his long political career, but he couldn't part with a few
mementos _ like documents validating his election to six consecutive
terms as governor.
   ``I still have six certificates of election,'' Faubus said
Sunday, a day after he took in $5,000 from the auction at his
mansion atop Governor's Hill.
   ``I think we had about 1,000 items listed _ a few large and most
of it small stuff. Political memorabilia must have been nearly half
of it,'' said the 79-year-old Faubus, who served as governor from
1955 to 1967. He has lost three comeback bids for governor, most
recently in 1986.
   One item that fetched $40 was a boat paddle embossed with a
likeness of Faubus and the slogan, ``Faubus for Arkansas,'' from his
1964 race. The most popular political items were license tags,
numbered ``1,'' reserved for the chief executive. ``I was amazed at
the prices. One went for $115, and the cheapest one was $95,'' he
said.
   About 200 people attended Saturday's auction at Faubus'
9,000-square-foot house, which is being sold to a Delaware antique
dealer whom Faubus declined to identify Sunday.

   Nobel Peace Prize-winning Mother Teresa
helped to reopen a convent that had been closed for 17 years, saying
she saw the nuns there doing ``something beautiful for God.''
   Closed because of declining membership, St. Mary's Convent is now
home to 13 nuns who belong to Mother Teresa's Missionaries of
Charity, Contemplative Order, said the Rev. Joseph J. Mirandi,
pastor of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church.
   About 1,500 people packed inside the church shoulder-to-shoulder
to listen to the 78-year-old Mother Teresa, who has become known as
the ``Saint of Calcutta'' for her work with the poor in that Indian
city.
   ``I hope they're going to do something beautiful for God,'' she
told the congregants at Sunday morning Mass. ``It is very important
to help each other and share with each other. I will pray that God's
blessing be with you all.''
   Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, an order of
3,000 nuns in 87 countries, in 1950. She became known as the ``Saint
of Calcutta'' for her work with the poor in that Indian city.
   The three-story convent in this northern New Jersey city was
built in 1910 and previously had been used by the Sisters of Charity.

   Sir David Lean, director of the Oscar-winning

quality films.
   ``Spend some money on risky subjects,'' said Lean, who won the
director's Academy Award for the 1962 movie. ``It's no good being
safe in this business. We've all got to be gamblers.''
   Lean made his comments Sunday at the Los Angeles premiere for the
recently restored three-hour, 40-minute director's cut of ``Lawrence
of Arabia.'' The premiere benefited the American Film Institute and
its campaign to restore and preserve classic films. The new version
already has been released in New York and Washington.
   Joining Lean here were composer Maurice Jarre, director of
photographer Fred A. Young and film editor Anne Coates. All three
won Oscars for their work on the movie, which won seven Academy
Awards, including best picture.
   Actors Anthony Quinn and Omar Shariff, who both starred in the

<HEAD>Umbrian Steel Town Claims Its Beheaded Saint Was The Real Valentine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TERNI, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Led by their Communist mayor, the people of
Terni have launched a crusade to reclaim St. Valentine, the patron
saint of lovers who has attained greater fame abroad than in his
native country.
   On Sunday, the city in central Italy's Umbria region launched a
yearly award ceremony dedicated to acts of love around the world.
Next year, it plans to offer free honeymoons to newlyweds.
   This steel town wants its decapitated 3rd century bishop to
really be its valentine.
   The Roman Catholic saint for lovers has been as much a mixture of
myth, religion and tradition as Easter bunnies or St. Nicholas, who
eventually became a jolly red-suited Santa Claus.
   The Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints says 17
Valentines are listed in the official encyclopedia of saints _
including ones from Italy, France, Spain, and Germany.
   ``But we are relatively sure that Terni's is the real Valentine
because he is the oldest,'' says Ivani Rossi, president of the
Valentian Cultural Center. He has been working to bring back what he
says is ``real significance'' to the festivity rather than ``a
growth in the Valentine gift industry.''
   According to historical accounts from the Middle Ages, Placido,
the prefect of Rome, had the spiritual head of Terni's Christians
beheaded on February 14 of the year 270 after having him imprisoned
and whipped.
   Valentino had a garden where, according to legend, he allowed
children to play or lovers to meet. While he was jailed Valentino
handed the keys of the garden to two carrier pigeons with a message
inviting the children of Terni to return there during his absence.
   After his martyrdom, Valentino's body was brought back here by
his followers and buried. The funeral urn was discovered in a
cemetery during the 17th century and is now kept in a basilica,
minus a tooth given at the time to Leopold of Austria, who venerated
the saint and funded the basilica's construction.
   Benedictine monks spread the cult of the saint to Anglo-Saxon
countries including England and the United States.
   Although Valentino remained the patron saint of Terni, town
residents _ as well as most Italians _ didn't realize how famous he
was becoming abroad, according to the current bishop of Terni,
Franco Gualdrini.
   ``We found, for example, that people knew more about the American
mafia `St. Valentine's Day Massacre' than about St. Valentine
himself,'' Gualdrini said in an interview, referring to the
Prohibition-era slaying of seven men in a Chicago garage by Al
Capone's mobsters.
   ``The commercial value of St. Valentine outstripped his spiritual
value,'' he said. ``This was something we had to change, considering
Terni had probably the world's best known saint.''
   A few years ago, the traditionally Communist administration of
Terni, led by Mayor Giacomo Porazzini, decided to work with the
local church on a mutually beneficial project _ restoring some
luster to Terni and its saint.
   A tourist marketing test in Japan showed the city and the area,
with spectacular waterfalls and walled medieval towns and churches,
had potential appeal.
   Now, more than 20,000 Japanese tourists stop at the basilica and
tour the area each year _ and Terni has its annual `love' awards
ceremony.
   Among winners Sunday were Nobel Peace Prize-winner Mother Teresa
of Calcutta; American Erich Segal, best-selling author of ``Love
Story''; actor Peter Ustinov and an Italian rescue brigade that
recently returned from the Armenian earthquake zone.
   Next year, the prize ceremony will be carried on a worldwide
satellite television program and the city will begin to offer free
one-week honeymoons to selected newlyweds.

<HEAD>Prospective Latin Aide Calls For Downgrading Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democrat who is set to become Bush
administration's top aide for Latin America was once a strong
supporter of the Nicaraguan Contras but now believes other
strategies should be pursued for achieving a settlement in Central
America.
   Bernard Aronson, who once advised President Carter and Vice
President Walter Mondale, believes the new administration should
make an all-out effort to build on the peace agreement the five
Central American presidents signed in August 1987.
   Aronson's views were outlined in a little-noticed paper he
co-authored last October which was intended to influence the debate
over Central America as the Reagan administration was bowing out.
   The report was published by Freedom House, a human rights group
based in New York.
   Eight others participated in writing the paper, titled ``Peace
Through Democracy, A Bipartisan Initiative for the Central American
Crisis.''
   Although there have been some objections to Aronson's prospective
appointment, administration aides say Secretary of State James A.
Baker has indicated that his decision is final.
   Baker has placed high priority on filling the post, vacated last
month by Elliott Abrams, with someone who will have more success
than Abrams did in forging a bipartisan policy on Central America.
   While the policies of the new administration are still in the
planning stage, the Central Americans themselves are engaged in a
flurry of diplomatic activity.
   Central American foreign ministers met in New York last week and
the five regional presidents were opening a two-day meeting today in
San Salvador to discuss the future of the Nicaraguan Contras and
other issues.
   Aronson, 42, helped write a pro-Contra aid speech for President
Reagan several years ago but the report he helped write last fall
suggests his views on rebel aid have shifted in light of new
developments.
   Baker has discussed the Central America issue only in general
terms but what he has said appears to be consistent with the
substance of the report co-authored by Aronson.
   While hinting that Contra aid may be a last resort at some point,
the report suggests that continued pursuit of that approach is
tactically unwise because of hostile public opinion in the United
States.
   ``Those who favor the immediate resumption of military aid to the
Nicaraguan resistance are in danger of once again launching a
military policy from a weak political base,'' the report said.
   It said few believe there is a broad enough consensus in support
of Contra aid to sustain that approach for a substantial period.
   Instead, the report recommends giving a ``rigorous test'' to the
Esquipulas agreement, signed by the five Central America presidents
18 months ago.
   Among other provisions, the agreement commits Nicaragua's leftist
government to establish democracy and also bars continued U.S. aid
to the Contras.
   Six months after the agreement was signed, Congress suspended
military aid to the rebels, most of whom have since fled to camps
along the Honduran border where they receive U.S. humanitarian
assistance.
   The Reagan administration was deeply mistrustful of the
agreement, seeing it as a mechanism that would relieve Contra
military pressure on the Sandinista government without ensuring a
democratic outcome in Nicaragua.
   American officials have repeatedly accused the Sandinista
government of dragging its feet in adopting democratic reforms.
   Abrams maintained that Contra military pressure was the only way
to ensure a democratic evolution in Nicaragua. Aronson suggests that
the Reagan administration should have pursued more vigorously the
opening created at Esquipulas, the site in Guatemala where the
agreement was signed.
   The Freedom House report said the accord has ``greater moral and
political validity than other approaches being considered.''
   On the other hand, it said the agreement has a number of
weaknesses, including a lack of ``compelling verification and
enforcement mechanisms'' and a reluctance ``to confront Soviet and
Cuban involvement in the region's turmoil.''
   Among other recommendations, the report calls for the
establishment of a bipartisan task force to determine whether the
agreement is an appropriate instrument for bringing about peace and
democracy in the region.

   The image and words heartened members of the
Congressional Military Reform Caucus.
   There was President Bush, standing on the deck of the
1,048-foot-long carrier America last month at the huge Norfolk Naval
Base and telling Navy personnel and contractor employees that he
wants ``tighter controls and higher standards in weapons
procurement.''
   ``I'm very hopeful. I know the president intends to make
changes,'' says Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del.
   ``We have a tremendous opportunity in the next few years,'' said
Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
   Roth and Boxer _ representatives of different sides of the aisle
and different sides of the Capitol _ last week were named co-chairs
of the caucus, an informal, bipartisan organization of House and
Senate members.
   The Republican-Democratic, House-Senate mix is standard. During
the 100th Congress, the caucus membership totaled 136 with 27
members of the Senate and 109 members of the House. Seventy-eight
were Democrats and 58 were Republicans.
   Members are ``of a like mind concerned about reform in the
military,'' said Boxer.
   At times during the eight-year tenure of Bush's predecessor,
Ronald Reagan, the caucus was frustrated.
   For example, in 1983, it led the fight for the creation of an
independent Pentagon operational test and evaluation office, but the
Reagan administration delayed the installation of a test director
until two years later.
   During the Reagan presidency and the accompanying record
peacetime military buildup, scandals surfaced about Pentagon payment
of exorbitant prices for hammers, wrenches and toilet seats.
   Of a more serious nature, the Justice Department has been
pursuing a two-year probe of alleged purchasing fraud. The case
involves charges that private consultants, hired by military
contractors, bribed Pentagon officials to obtain inside information
that gave companies an edge in bidding for Defense Department work.
   ``Ronald Reagan is the true father of the caucus,'' said Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee and a frequent critic of the past Republican
administration.
   The caucus says its purpose is not to advocate ``overall
increases or decreases in defense spending, only more effective
expenditure of those dollars allocated for national defense.''
   ``The notion is not to argue what weapons are needed. We're
trying to find a way to make the most of the military for less
money,'' said Boxer.
   The caucus began in 1981 after former Rep. G. William Whitehurst,
R-Va., noticed an article in The Wall Street Journal on military
reform. The story's author was former Colorado senator and onetime
presidential candidate Gary Hart.
   In reading the article, Whitehurst found that he shared some of
the same views as Hart. The senator and the congressman huddled on
military reform, joined forces with a handful of others and formed
the caucus.
   Initially, the organization concentrated on such military reforms
as maneuver tactics and leadership training. Later, as the caucus
increased in numbers, it turned its attention to purchasing reform
and conventional weapons.
   The organization says its activities ``are intended to support
the regular committee work for a more effective national defense.''
   ``We've held hearings we couldn't get the Armed Services
Committee to hold. The caucus has pushed Armed Services,'' Boxer
said.
   The caucus has no budget, no dues, not even an official phone
number. Its staff is the staff of the co-chairs who handle mailings
and pay for events.
   The caucus holds frequent briefings and seminars for members on
such issues as the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the military budget and
conventional defense.
   This congressional session, the focus will be on promoting
legislation to strengthen the procurement system and whistleblower
protection, and tighten the revolving door between the Pentagon and
the defense industry, said Boxer and Roth.
   Affecting the reform effort will be the budget crunch facing the
Pentagon. In his speech Thursday, Bush proposed a $308.8 billion
defense budget for fiscal 1990, eliminating the 2 percent increase
proposed by Reagan in January.
   ``With less funds available, it will be critically important that
we get the biggest bang for the buck,'' said Roth. ``Centralized
procurement within the department _ this kind of approach is the
highest priority on the agenda.''
   Roth, who has been called a ``cheap hawk,'' jokes that he has to
``live up to his reputation.''

   People who predict the future will
have to reveal their past if officials in this gambling resort get
their way.
   City council last week unanimously passed a measure to require
palm readers to undergo a criminal check, fingerprinting and
positive identification when they go for their annual license. The
city currently charges a $400 license fee for readers to practice
their trade.
   ``The city can't deal in morality, but it can regulate things
better,'' said Councilwoman Louise Palmentieri, who proposed the
measure. The council will take a final vote Wednesday.
   Many established readers support the effort.
   ``People come in here to work for a couple of months, and we
don't know who they really are,'' said Sam Mitchell, part of a
palm-reading family that has operated here for more than 50 years.
``We want the tighter restrictions. It gives us the best
protection.''
   Sharon Annette, a Boardwalk phrenologist _ someone who claims to
detect character traits in the shape of a person's skull _ said the
legalization of gambling 10 years ago has increased demand for
fortune tellers' services and the need for tougher licensing
regulations.
   ``We get a lot of bus people who want a reading to see how their
luck is running,'' she said. ``Most of Atlantic City's readers have
been here for a long time. But since the casinos came, a lot of new
(readers) came in.''
   Altantic City required non-resident workers to register with the
city from 1953 to 1972, but it was dropped after civil rights groups
complained it violated individuals' rights, Police Chief Joseph
Pasquale said.
   ``It was a good system, though, because we found people who were
wanted for murder in other states,'' Pasquale said.

<HEAD>Sheep Production Once Exceeded US Cattle Herd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to livestock, it may be hard to
realize today that the United States was once a nation of sheep, not
cows.
   Not anymore, of course. The Agriculture Department reported last
week that the nation's cattle inventory, although down slightly,
totaled nearly 99.5 million head on Jan. 1. The number of sheep and
lambs increased a bit for the third straight year to 10.8 million.
   Even milk cows, at 10.2 million head, nearly matched the U.S.
sheep flock. And dairy cow numbers were the smallest since 1872.
   ``Sheep and lamb production has long been an important segment of
our economy,'' the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said
in a supplemental report. ``Since colonial times, production of
sheep and lamb for meat and wool has substantially contributed to
our food and fiber industry.''
   Before the 1900s, wool production was most important, while sheep
and lamb output for meat was incidental. But the report said ``there
was a marked change'' from 1870 to 1920 as the production of lambs
for slaughter became increasingly important.
   The USDA began officially estimating sheep and lamb numbers right
after the Civil War. On Jan. 1, 1867, those totaled 46.3 million
head having a value of about $108 million, or about $2.40 per head.
   ``There were about one-third more sheep than cattle in this
earliest count,'' the report said. ``By 1884, sheep and lamb numbers
increased to 53.3 million head but exceeded cattle numbers for the
last time.''
   According to USDA records, the cattle inventory in 1867 was 28.6
million head worth an estimated $547.9 million, an average of $19.13
per head.
   By 1884, when sheep totaled 53.3 million head, cattle were at
49.8 million. The following year, in 1885, sheep were estimated at
49.6 million.
   ``Sheep and lamb numbers passed through many cyclical phases,''
the report said. ``Inventory declined after 1884 until 1897 and then
increased again until 1909, when almost 50.8 million head were on
U.S. farms and ranches.''
   The next peak for sheep and lambs was in 1932 when nearly 54
million head were reported. The all-time high was in 1942 when 56.2
million head were being raised to help with the U.S. effort in World
War II, both for wool and meat.
   Inventories dropped after the war, declining to fewer than 30
million head by 1950 and then mostly leveled off. After 1960 through
most of the 1970s, sheep and lambs continued to decline and than
hovered just under 13 million head from 1977 to 1982.
   The U.S. flock dropped to below 10 million head, an all-time low,
on Jan. 1, 1986, before the modest recovery of recent years.
   A number of causes are blamed for the demise of the U.S. sheep
industry, the report said. Mostly it has stemmed from a reduced
demand for wool, reflecting the intrusion of synthetic fibers and
cheaper substitute materials, plus a declining demand for lamb in
consumer diets.
   One big problem has been the difficulty in obtaining and keeping
reliable herders to manage and care for range flocks, which are
located mostly in the West. The increased competition for public
range land also was cited.
   ``Another important factor which has contributed to the decline
is the increasing problem of predators (such as coyotes) in many
range and farm-flock producing states,'' the report said. ``Also,
relatively large imports of lamb and mutton have contributed to the
decline of the domestic sheep industry.''

   Last month's trade figures released by the
Commerce Department showed an impressive gain in the value of
agricultural exports from levels the year before, says an
Agriculture Department analysis.
   Agricultural exports in November, the most recent figures
reported, topped $3.3 billion, up $500 million from a year earlier
and the highest for a single month since December 1984, the report
said. The gains reflect higher export prices due to tighter U.S.
supplies stemming from last summer's drought.
   But from a volume perspective, the gains were more modest, the
report said. November shipments rose 2 percent from a year earlier
to 11.4 million metric tons.
   ``So far this year, U.S. agricultural exports ... are commanding
a $50 per ton premium on the world market over year-ago levels,''
the report said. ``The largest price increases have been in those
commodities most severely affected by last summer's drought _ wheat,
feed grains and soybeans and products.''

   A new comedy, ``Without Apologies,'' is full of
the old-fashioned kind of laughs that come when belief is suspended
and theater not overly concerned with realistic situations.
   ``Without Apologies'' is playing at the off-Broadway Hudson Guild
Theater, where it had its New York premiere Sunday.
   Irish actress Pauline Flanagan shines in the role she also had at
the play's debut at the Dorset, England, Theater Festival. As Gwen,
a plump, droll and sensible housewife in a genteelly shabby home,
she dithers with delicious timing and inflections.
   The Thom Thomas comedy is about the later years of the characters
from ``The Importance of Being Earnest,'' the 1895 play that led to
playwright Oscar Wilde being sued for having libeled the Beaumont
family.
   In the 34 years since Ernie Beaumont (Peter Pagan) left Gwen, his
bride-to-be (Miss Flanagan), at the altar and ran off with Cecily
(Carrie Nye), the fiancee of his brother, Algy Beaumont (Kurt
Knudson), the two couples have had no contact. Gwen and Algy, the
two left behind, married and live in her mother's house, with her
mother and a renter upstairs.
   When Ernie and Cecily arrive virtually unannounced for a visit,
they bring their daughter Brenda (Laura Brutsman), dressed like a
child but 30. An unforgiving Gwen says it would be inconvenient for
them to spend the night, but they inform her they're broke and
moving in permanently.
   That sets up the plot: Will Brenda get together with the renter
(Edmund Lewis), a jazz drummer who aspires to be a comedian? Will
Cecily, played by the blonde, willowy Miss Nye, forsake plummy-voice
Ernie for Algy and scramble the family again?
   And there's one more question: Will the Beaumont descendants sue
Thomas, director Edgar Lansbury and masterful set designer John Wulp?
   With jokes about the footstool, a brotherly competition over war
wounds and Miss Flanagan crooning her comic lines up and down her
vocal register, one is simply laughing too much to care.

<TEXT>
   Gun owner groups are opening fire on
congressional efforts to outlaw semiautomatic assault weapons such
as the one used in last month's Stockton, Calif., playground
massacre that left five children dead.
   ``I think a lot of people could get hurt politically in voting
for this bill,'' says John M. Snyder, public affairs director of the
Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.
   He and other gun lobbyists were on Capitol Hill last week to
combat a bill sponsored by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that
would halt sales of AK47s, Israeli-made Uzis and a host of other
military-style weapons with banana clips, wire stocks and
sinister-looking snouts that roughly fall under the heading of
assault rifles.
   Led by the efficient and well financed National Rifle
Association, gun lobbyists base their muscle on support from
hundreds of thousands of hunters and other gun owners across the
country who fear they will lose their weapons.
   Lawmakers have long been reluctant to tangle with the NRA for
fear of repercussions at election time.
   The NRA's power, however, may have waned a bit in recent years
when lawmakers approved a ban on plastic guns that fail to register
on metal detectors and required the attorney general to come up with
a plan to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals.
   The NRA ended up supporting the plastic gun ban after initial
opposition failed to scuttle it. Handing the more complicated
assignment to the attorney general represented a compromise struck
after the Senate balked at a House-passed plan to do no more than
study the problem.
   Opponents of the NRA, however, say there is no question that it
still wields considerable power.
   ``The NRA has intimidated members of Congress in a political
sense with their money and their political muscle,'' says Rep.
Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio, who was defeated last year in an effort
to win approval of a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers. He is
trying again this year.
   Metzenbaum, however, was re-elected handily while under attack by
the NRA.
   His supporters say the criticism was offset somewhat by an
endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, based in part on his
support for gun control. They say the Senate may well pass assault
rifle legislation this year.
   The current round began shortly after a Jan. 17 incident in which
a gunman opened fire with an AK47 on 400 children on a playground
outside the Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, Calif.
   Five youngsters died and 29 were injured along with one teacher.
Three persons remain in the hospital.
   First to respond with legislation was Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
   ``The slaughter of citizens on the streets and children in the
schoolyard by weapons designed for slaughter on the battlefield must
be stopped,'' delared Berman.
   His bill, however, has not generated wide support, even among gun
control advocates, mainly because it bans possession of assault
rifles and thus requires owners to turn them in to police or the
local sheriff. By contrast, Metzenbaum's bill would ban sales of the
weapons but not possession.
   Trying to collect huge numbers of semiautomatic rifles already in
private hands could plunge the bill into a political quagmire,
control advocates fear.
   Other California congressmen, including Reps. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., and Fortney H. (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., have been searching
for a less stringent formula. And any bill clearly has a long, hard
haul to reach floor passage.
   In the Senate, Illinois Democrat Paul Simon's Judiciary
subcommittee on the Constitution is believed to be closely divided
over whether to push legislation this year. But even if it is
blocked there, Metzenbaum still can go to the floor and appeal to
the whole Senate to attach his bill to other legislation.
   NRA lobbyists say guns dubbed assault weapons are not much
different from more traditional hunting guns. They call the major
difference cosmetic and point to the military-style appearance of
the AK47s and Uzis.
   ``There is no functional difference between those firearms that
are currently being called assault rifles and what would be called
traditional hunting rifles,'' says NRA federal lobbyist David
Conover.
   He claims that Metzenbaum's measure would not only outlaw
rapid-fire grease guns and pistol-gripped, round-drummed
``streetsweeper'' shotguns but such old standbys of the sportsman as
the wooden-stocked Remington model 4.
   The same disclaimer of any ``functional difference'' was
expressed at last week's hearing by Edward Conroy, acting deputy
associate director for law enforcement of the bureau of alcohol,
tobacco and firearms.
   But he also expressed sympathy with the aim of the legislation to
take assault weapons out of the hands of criminals.
   NRA spokesman have been arguing that a ban on the weapon would
not really work because it would be disobeyed by criminals and kept
out of the hands of law-abiding hunters and other sportsmen. But
Metzenbaum scoffs at that notion.
   ``We know of only one instance in which this was used for
hunting,'' he declared last week. ``When a psychopath in California
went hunting school children.''

<HEAD>Drug Addiction Turned Actor Into `A Sick Kid,' Mother Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Todd Bridges is ``a sick kid''
victimized by drug addiction, according to the mother of the former
teen-age star of ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' who is jailed on attempted
murder charges.
   ``It's hard to believe it's come to this,'' said Betty Bridges,
adding that family problems and early celebrity status have hurt her
23-year-old son.
   Earlier this month, Bridges was charged with shooting Kenneth
Clay, 25, in both arms and the chest in a house known as a drug
hangout. An associate, Harvey Duckett, 30, is accused of slashing
Clay's face with a knife.
   Bridges is being held without bail until his preliminary hearing
Friday and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.
   ``I don't know what a drug addict is capable of,'' his mother
said last week. ``But I know that Todd Bridges, my son, is not
capable of shooting someone like that.''
   The attack came 10 days after Bridges was arrested for
investigation of possessing cocaine near the house, police said.
Previously, he received a suspended sentence in January 1987 after
pleading no contest to making a bomb threat, and he was fined for
carrying a concealed weapon in 1983.
   ``The drugs and the pressure have made Todd a sick kid and he
shouldn't be made out to be some criminal,'' Mrs. Bridges said in an
interview in Sunday's Los Angeles Daily News.
   She said her 1984 divorce from James Bridges contributed to their
son's troubles. ``I'm only just understanding how deeply hurt Todd
was,'' she said.
   Actor Conrad Bain, who played Bridge's adoptive father in the TV
situation comedy ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' said Bridges was angry and
erratic toward the end of the series, apparently because of
financial problems and his parents' divorce.
   ``He was so sensitive,'' Bain said. ``Just the kind of kid you
knew wasn't going to handle all the problems real well.''
   Bridges made his first commercial at age 6 and starred in the
television comedy series ``Fish'' four years later. At age 12 he
landed the role as Gary Coleman's brother Willis on ``Diff'rent
Strokes.''
   Johnnie Cochran, Bridges' attorney, said his client's problems
are common to young stars after their first big success.
   ``Like other child stars, Todd grew up faster than other kids,''
Cochran said. ``When the series ended (in 1985), the adjustment was
real tough for him.''
   Bridges had trouble getting work after the show's last season. He
began using drugs 18 months later, Mrs. Bridges said.
   ``All of a sudden he started coming home looking strange,'' she
said.
   Bridges told his mother last June of his drug problem, she said.
He spent one month in a drug rehabilitation center and stayed clean
until November, she said.
   But his close friend Jesse Arragon was killed when his motorcycle
hit a passing truck, prompting Bridges to take his first drink in
six months that night, Mrs. Bridges said.
   ``That was the last straw,'' Mrs. Bridges said. ``After that he
began living with those hoodlums in South Central (Los Angeles). He
got so crazy I almost called an insane asylum to pick him up. I was
afraid he would die out there.''

<TEXT>
   About 30 leftist rebels lounge in
the shade of tile-roofed porches in the center of this farming town,
taking some time to relax while the government considers their
proposal to take part in elections.
   The fighters, some as young as 13, savor soft drinks and snacks
out of cellophane bags, flirt with the town's shy girls, cradle
babies not seen for weeks or months, play cards with the townfolk.
   Three rebels, one of them missing half an arm from a prematurely
exploded grenade, kick a soccer ball in the cobbled street.
   There has been a sharp decline in fighting since the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front said last month that it would
participate in presidential elections if the March 19 balloting is
postponed for six months.
   The insurgents have also declared a complete truce during the
meeting of five Central American presidents taking place in El
Salvador today and Tuesday.
   As the lazy afternoon in Las Flores last week showed, the
guerrillas have been permitted at least a brief respite from their
arduous life in the mountains.
   Maria Eusebia Benavides, 65, was looking for the son she hadn't
seen in eight years among the men lounging in the plaza.
   Sitting on a rock beneath its only shade tree, she cast glances
full of tentative hope at a tall guerrilla fighter who regarded her
with equal anxiety.
   After a few awkward minutes, the rebel leaned his M-16 against a
wall and crossed the 20 yards of sun-baked square separating him
from Mrs. Benavides.
   ``Madre?'' he said, as she _ sure now that they were face to face
_ stood.
   ``My son,'' she said.
   Mrs. Benavides and her son, who goes by the nom de guerre Ramon,
embraced.
   ``I didn't recognize him at first,'' Mrs. Benavides said later,
patting her son on the knee as they sat on a stoop. Smiling a
campesino smile with more gaps than teeth, she said, ``He was just a
kid when he went away.''
   Ramon was on R&amp;R because the insurgents initiate most combat in
the nine-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government that has
claimed an estimated 65,000 lives.
   The Jan. 24 guerrilla proposal was a dramatic turnabout: the
insurgents would participate in elections if they were postponed and
if other security and anti-fraud conditions were met.
   The reduction in attacks in recent weeks prevents the guerrillas'
enemies from accusing them of extending an olive branch with one
hand while delivering blows with the other.
   Ramon took from his knapsack a photograph wrapped in plastic of a
young woman and a baby. ``This is your grandson and
daughter-in-law,'' he said, handing his mother the picture.
   Mrs. Benavides told of their frustrated attempt at a reunion last
October. Advised by a guerrilla ``correo'' _ boys and girls used as
messengers _ that Ramon would come down from the mountains to Las
Flores, she made the arduous 10-hour bus trip from her southern
province.
   She waited three days in vain before going home. The day she
left, he arrived in town.
   ``Since no one could give me news of him, I thought he was
probably dead. I'm so happy to be able to see him now'' said the old
woman, her skin rough and wrinkled from decades of fieldwork. ``I'm
in poor health and I know it will be the last time.''
   If the guerrilla proposal is rejected _ as appears likely _ the
lull that allows reunions is likely to end. The rebels say they will
resume battle with a vengeance.
   ``The people will realize the government and armed forces are not
interested in peace. They'll see there is no alternative but to
escalate the struggle,'' said Olga, a mid-level guerrilla officer
who uses no other name.
   At long intervals, bombs exploded on the far side of a hill
outside Las Flores, 35 miles northwest of San Salvador.
   ``Tests,'' said Olga, indicating with her chin the direction of
the blasts.
   Besides resting, the guerrillas are manufacturing and stockpiling
what they call ``popular armament'' _ mines, mortars and grenades
they make with pipes, powder, wood, rope, burlap, nails and anything
else that works.
   Though they have not definitively rejected it, the Salvadoran
armed forces and the government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte
and have reacted coolly to the guerrilla proposal.
   And though the Bush administration has called the guerrilla's
proposal ``a step forward,'' there appears to be little chance the
overture will prosper.

<HEAD>Fighter Deal with Japan Under Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A potential battle is brewing between Congress
and the Bush administration over plans to transfer to Japan $7
billion in advanced aircraft technology developed for the U.S. Air
Force's F-16 fighter.
   The controversy over Japan's proposed FSX warplane casts a shadow
over last week's summit visit by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
the first foreign leader to be hosted at the White House since
President Bush took office.
   Under the pending agreement, St. Louis-based General Dynamics
would join forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to
co-develop and co-produce a new-generation Japanese fighter, for
deployment in the late 1990s.
   Proponents say the deal is the best that could be negotiated in
view of Japanese refusal to buy wholly American-built planes, and
that it fosters beneficial technology transfer in both directions
with Japan while generating income and jobs for U.S. industry.
   Critics, however, contend the agreement amounts to a
technological giveaway that will enable the Japanese to compete more
effectively against this country in the global aviation market. They
argue that Tokyo should purchase American-made fighters to help
offset the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   The FSX issue surfaced during a Capitol Hill meeting Friday
between Takeshita and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and a group of other
senators involved with trade and foreign affairs.
   During the closed-door meeting, questions over the proposed deal
were raised by Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., according to Japanese
officials who briefed reporters after the session.
   Danforth was among 12 senators who signed a letter to Bush urging
that his administration conduct a complete review of the FSX
agreement, which had been negotiated under the Reagan administration.
   The letter, organized by Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., said the deal posed complex issues including defense
burden-sharing and the ``long-term impact on the health and
competitiveness of the American aerospace industry, the only high
technology area in which the United States remains the undisputed
world leader.''
   ``We are requesting that you order a complete review of the FSX
program within the administration, including the departments of
Commerce, Labor and Energy, as well as the Office of the Trade
Representative and the White House science office,'' the senators
told Bush.
   After the letter went to the White House, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said at a meeting Thursday with Japanese Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno that the administration was, in fact, reviewing
the jet fighter project and no decision on it had been made.
   Japanese officials said Uno urged Baker to process a license
quickly and notify Congress of the technology export. The Japanese
have said they want to start the project before March 31, the end of
their fiscal year.
   A memorandum of understanding on the FSX was signed last November
by U.S. and Japanese officials. Once the administration finally
certifies the agreement, Congress would have 30 days in which it
could vote to disapprove the deal.
   Fueling the controversy over the FSX was an article Jan. 29 in
The Washington Post by Clyde V. Prestowitz, a former Commerce
Department official and outspoken advocate of a hard-line U.S.
stance in negotiations with Japan.
   Prestowitz said the deal would increase the U.S. burden of
defending Japan ``by diverting scarce Japanese defense dollars ...
from immediate procurement needs into a 10-year project.''
   Also, he wrote, ``it will transfer technology developed at great
expense to U.S. taxpayers at very low cost to a country whose
primary interest is not defense but catching up with America in
aircraft and other high-technology industries.''
   Alvin A. Spivak, a spokesman for General Dynamics, responded that
under the deal American industry _ including the No. 2 U.S. defense
contractor and other companies _ will receive 35 percent to 45
percent of the $1.2 billion being spent on development of the FSX as
well as a comparable share of the $5 billion production program.
   The agreement offers a chance ``to provide jobs for American
workers and to bring many hundreds of millions of dollars into the
American economy that otherwise would stay in Japan if they were to
develop their own fighter aircraft,'' he said.
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., called the FSX deal
a ``terrible mistake.'' He said he hoped Congress will be able to
``discourage the administration from following this course before we
have a bitter fight about it.''
   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., said bluntly about the deal:
``It stinks. ... It's about time we had the courage to stand up and
say we're not going to take this any longer''
   D'Amato said if the agreement goes through, ``what will take
place is that 10 years from now, they (the Japanese) will build the
superior airframes, they will have the superior technology that
we've helped them obtain by turning over some of our technical base
as well in this deal.''
   In the House, Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said he was ``very
disturbed'' about the FSX technology transfer.
   ``We can't prevent the Japanese from building their own domestic
aerospace and defense industries,'' he said. ``But I see no reason
for us to hand them the blueprints at a very modest price.''

   Up to 1,000 sheep being escorted across
the Ventura Freeway prompted a 30-minute closure of some exit ramps
on the highway, police said.
   California Highway Patrol officers early Sunday diverted traffic
from the Las Virgenes Road ramps as the sheep were escorted over a
bridge from the north side of the freeway to the south, dispatcher
Gina Thomson said.
   It was the second such crossing this year. Such events are not
uncommon for Sunday mornings this time of year.
   Several flocks of sheep graze the hillsides of Calabasas, which
is nearly 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

   More than 2,000 people invaded a housing
development to see a little American bird, the first golden winged
warbler recorded in Europe.
   At one stage Sunday, police with bullhorns had to control the
crowd as the birdwatchers, equipped with binoculars, telescopes and
cameras, strained for a glimpse of the warbler at Maidstone, Kent,
40 miles southeast of London.
   Some of the visitors were from Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Ian Mills, a British visitor who traveled 270 miles to be there,
said` ``I've been all over the country to look at rare birds and a
crowd of a few hundred is not unusual but I've never seen anything
like this.''
   ``There were well over 2,000 people present when I was there and
at times roads were choked and traffic could hardly move,'' he said.
   ``This must have been the largest gathering of bird-watchers to
look at one bird there has ever been,'' said Richard Millington, a
spokesman for the Birdline telephone information service, whose
report about the warbler drew the crowds.
   The warbler is thought to have been blown across the Atlantic in
the fall of 1988 while migrating from its breeding territory in the
northeastern United States and southeast Canada to Colombia and
Guatemala for the winter.

<TEXT>
   The astronaut who commanded the first
post-Challenger mission was not medically qualified to fly and
another astronaut, who is colorblind, received a waiver so he can go
into space, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Johnson Space Center medical qualification board recommended
last year that space shuttle Discovery commander Frederick H. Hauck
be disqualified because of kidney stone problems, but was overruled,
the Houston Chronicle reported.
   Sources, who asked not to be named, also told the newspaper that
Daniel C. Brandenstein, chief of the astronaut corps, failed an eye
test in 1987 but received a waiver to fly again, the newspaper said.
   In both cases, the sources said Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly,
NASA's associate administrator for flight operations at Washington
headquarters, interceded.
   The sources are active members in Flight Crew Operations and in
the Space and Life Sciences Directorate, which includes the flight
medicine clinic and medical operations branch at the space center,
the newspaper said.
   Truly declined to comment on individual medical cases Friday.
   ``I try to do two things,'' Truly said. ``I try to make sure from
the management view that the (medical) process works, that
individual health problems are treated fairly by the (medical
qualification) board and management, and secondly to protect the
rights of the individual involved, and the major objective is to get
healthy astronauts to the launch pad for the mission.''
   Truly's spokeswoman Sarah Keegan said Sunday she also could not
comment on specific medical cases.
   Johnson Space Center director Aaron Cohen said: ``Neither Rick
Hauck nor Dan Brandenstein _ nor any other astronaut for that matter
_ has received preferential treatment in the consideration of
medical issues.''
   During October interviews and again last week, Hauck and
Brandenstein would not discuss their medical records, the Chronicle
said.
   Sources said the Space Medicine Board grounded Hauck early in
1988 because of a kidney stone problem, but the recommendation was
later overruled, and subsequently reversed.
   Brandenstein failed the Farnsworth Lantern color perception test
in 1987, sources said, but received the only waiver ever issued to
an astronaut for colorblindness.
   Some of the most important of about 2,000 circuit breakers and
switches on the shuttle orbiter are color-coded, including some of
those used in the launch and re-entry, a source said.
   Brandenstein is scheduled to command the Columbia space shuttle
in November. He has flown on two previous shuttle flights, in 1983
and in 1985.
   Hauck flew on shuttle flights in 1983 and 1984, as well as
commanding the Discovery flight last September. He has said the
Discovery flight was his last shuttle mission.
   Hauck had a kidney stone dissolved at Houston's Methodist
Hospital last April, but the process doesn't guarantee that another
kidney stone will not form.

   Nineteen months after the United
States joined an effort to oust Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's
defense chief remains in power, dominating a dispirited and divided
opposition.
   However, with Panama sinking deeper into economic crisis, both
his supporters and opponents feel the nation must reach an
accommodation with the new Bush administration.
   ``We have to talk to the gringos,'' said Tomas Altamirano Duque,
a congressman and uncle of Carlos Duque, the Noriega-backed
candidate in the May 7 presidential election.
   ``I think Bush is more intelligent (than Reagan) and can be more
practical.''
   Jorge Richa, a government critic and former president of the
Industrialists' Association, declared: ``We cannot maintain an
antagonistic relationship with the United States indefinitely.''
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III has asserted that ``it
is difficult to make progress'' on U.S.-Panamanian issues as long as
Gen. Noriega remains in charge.
   Washington says Noriega reneged on deals to leave the country
last year.
   Panama's opposition, which began an effort to oust Noriega with
U.S. support in the summer of 1987, now finds itself weaker than
ever.
   The United States indicted Noriega in February 1988, alleging he
protected drug-runners in Panama and conspired to distribute
narcotics.
   When President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega later
that month, Noriega had Panama's congress replace Delvalle.
   The United States, which still recognizes Delvalle as president,
then imposed economic sanctions on Panama in an attempt to force
Noriega to resign.
   ``It was a total failure,'' said a radio station director, who
demanded anonymity for fear of reprisals. ``It was a bluff and
Noriega knew it was a bluff. Noriega knows the gringos _ he has
worked for them.''
   Noriega appealed to anti-Yankee sentiment, portraying himself as
a David fighting the U.S. Goliath in campaign-style speeches in the
countryside.
   The Panamanian government blames the United States for the
economic crisis; and the opposition says the sanctions only gave the
government an excuse for poor economic stewardship.
   ``In 1987 there was a $200 million budget deficit,'' said
industrialist Carlos Valencia. ``The economy was worn out,
stimulated only by massive borrowing.''
   Until a year ago, the construction industry had boomed and
international banking and business through free trade zones had
spurred the economy.
   In 1988, the gross national product declined by 10 percent,
unemployment rose 22 percent and economic activity fell by 32
percent.
   Panama also experienced a severe cash shortage and has stopped
payments on a nearly $5 billion foreign debt.
   ``We estimate that 60,000 people lost their jobs in 1988,'' said
Valencia.
   The opposition has not been able to make political strides from
the economic hard times in this country of 2 million people. Its
only leader with popular appeal, Arnulfo Arias Madrid, died in
August, leaving the opposition squabbling over his successor.
   Arias, thrice overthrown by the military between 1941 and 1968,
was the only political figure with wide appeal besides populist
military dictator Omar Torrijos, who died in 1979 in a plane crash.
   Noriega considers himself Torrijos' political and military heir.
   In a dinner speech Jan. 17 to roaring crowd of businessmen,
military officers and government officials, Noriega warned of a
possible reduction in the bureaucracy and even the elimination of
some government agencies.
   Panama's economic problems require a political agreement here and
abroad, said Richa. ``The government alone cannot negotiate with the
United States. The opposition alone cannot do it either. We need
unity.
   ``Maybe under Bush both sides can get an opportunity to save face
and start again. The United States cannot maintain this situation of
economic deterioration of Panama. There is too much at stake.''
   The U.S. maintains several military bases in Panama, which are
estimated to put nearly $200 million a year into the Panamanian
economy. Under treaties negotiated in 1977, the United States must
turn over control of the Panama Canal and vacate the installations
by Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega maintains that the United States wants him out of office
because he opposes renegotiation of the treaties.
   Valencia expressed another opposition fear.
   ``We need U.S. economic aid to rebuild the economy. But we hope
the United States does not make a deal with Noriega behind the
opposition's back,'' he said.
   The main opposition parties have joined behind a single
presidential candidate, Guillermo Endara.
   ``There is no real freedom,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, leader
of the Christian Democrat Party and vice presidential candidate on
the opposition ticket. ``But the opposition to Noriega is so great
he will be buried by the votes of the people.''
   But the government has closed opposition media and sent scores of
opposition leaders into exile.
   In his speech, Noriega said the military will remain a vital part
of the nation ``even if the opposition should happen, by some
chance, to win.''

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS 3 grafs to UPDATE with close. Pickup 4th graf pvs, ``A

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was stronger against the Japanese yen
Monday, while stock prices declined moderately in reaction to a hike
in the U.S. prime lending rate.
   The dollar ended the day's trading at 128.30 yen, up 0.65 yen
from Friday's close of 127.65 yen. It traded in a range of
128.20-128.63 yen and was quoted at 128.50 yen at midday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 53.56-point winner Friday, closed 146.67 points
or 0.4 percent lower at 31,985.32. It finished last week at a record
high 32,131.99 points.
   A hike in the prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 11 percent
by many American commercial banks and the news of a
higher-than-expected U.S. producer price index for January, both
announced Friday, combined to spur the dollar's rally, said a dealer
at the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dollar dipped slightly in midmorning selling, but rebounded
somewhat later. Trading was slow, the dealer said.
   The dollar's direction hinges on what happens to overseas
interest rates, so players here are inclined, in the absence of any
compelling incentives to trade during Tokyo business hours, to let
the European and U.S. markets take the lead, the dealer added,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The prime lending rate is closely watched because bankers use it
as a basis for calculating interest on corporate loans and for
determining various types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer
loans, including home equity loans.
   Higher U.S. interest rates make the dollar more attractive to
foreign investors, but tend to have a negative impact on stock
prices.
   Kazuhiro Nakamura of Wako Securities said Tokyo share prices
declined in reaction to the interest rate hike and also to the
defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party Sunday in a closely
watched parliamentary by-election.
   The election was seen as an indication of public sentiment toward
the LDP following the passage of a long-sought tax reform package
last December that included introduction of an unpopular 3 percent
sales tax.

   Actor James Caan suffered broken ribs
after he lost control of his motorcycle and it crashed, police said.
   Caan, 49, wasn't wearing a helmet but suffered no serious head
injuries in the crash, which occurred shortly before noon Sunday,
said police Lt. Barney Melekian.
   The crash were under investigation, but there were no sign that
Caan was intoxicated, Melekian said. Weather conditions were clear
and no other vehicles were involved.
   Besides fractured ribs, the actor suffered minor facial cuts and
bruises, said Corinne Rogers, nursing supervisor at St. Johns
Hospital and Medical Center, where Caan was listed in good condition.
   Caan played Sonny Corleone, the hot-headed son of the Mafia
chieftain in the Oscar-winning film ``The Godfather,'' and portrayed
terminally ill Chicago Bears football running back Brian Piccolo in
the TV movie ``Brian's Song.''
   His other credits include ``Rollerball,'' ``Cinderella Liberty,''
``A Bridge Too Far,'' ``Freebie and the Bean'' and ``Rabbit Run.''
   The crash came two months after actor Gary Busey crashed his
Harley-Davidson while riding without a helmet.
   He suffered serious head injuries but is improving.
   Like Busey, Caan was riding a Harley.

<HEAD>&amp; All That It Stands For</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Say what you will it about the savings and loan
crisis, it has done wonders for the ampersand.
   Vaguely old fashioned, the ampersand _ that curly little symbol
that stands for ``and'' _ seemed to be in a decline until the
financial difficulties of the S&amp;L industry put it on every front
page. For some reason, S&amp;Ls are always abbreviated with an
ampersand, just as football's Super Bowls are numbered with Roman
numerals.
   Like everything else, the ampersand has a history. According to
Robert Hendrickson, who wrote the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins, it was invented by Marcus Tiro, a freed slave and secretary
to Cicero, a Roman statesman, orator and author.
   Tiro's job was taking down Cicero's dictation. Cicero talked
fast, so Tiro created the first known system of shorthand, including
the ampersand. Tiro's ``Tironian Notes'' saw wide use in Europe for
nearly a thousand years.
   The &amp; itself was just a quick way of writing ``et,'' which means
``and'' in Latin. The name ``ampersand'' is a corruption of the term
``and per se and,'' which means ``as follows.''
   The Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage by William Morris and
Mary Morris laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and
abandon their ampersands.
   The Morrises note that the ad firm of Batten, Barton, Durstin &amp;
Osborne switched to simply Batten, Barton, Durstin, Osborne,
dropping the ampersand and losing ``part of the charm which led
Heywood Broun to say that the corporate name sounded to him like `a
beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps.'''
   In any event, the Morrises, getting down to business, decree that
the ampersand is to be avoided ``in writing of formal or semiformal
nature, save for the most impromptu personal notes.''
   However, the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback, even
without the S&amp;L crisis' spur of conspicuousness, says Rick Bragdon,
senior vice president in a San Francisco firm which does ``name
development'' for companies changing their images.
   He said after stiff debate during a yearlong ``identity program''
for Pacific Gas and Electric, it was decided to abandon the ``and''
in ``PG and E,'' its old symbol, in favor of ``PG&amp;E.''
   ``We had to resolve once and for all how to represent `and,'''
Bragdon said.
   ``There were a whole variety of constituencies. Lots of people
wanted `and' and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very
discrete plus sign would be modern and hip. We advocated the
ampersand as an inalienable part of the name _ a beautiful, stylized
ampersand.''
   However, to show how short-lived these victories are, Bragdon
said his own firm has changed its name, abandoning an ampersand in
the process. It used to be S&amp;O Consultants.
   The final decision was to go with Addison Design Consultants,
over the objections of founder and chairman Bob Ohrenschalls. In the
old days, he was the fellow behind the &amp;.

<HEAD>`Lavender Hill Mob' Screenwriter Dead At 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British screenwriter T.E.B. Clarke, whose often
hilarious screenplays included the Oscar-winning script for ``The
Lavender Hill Mob'', has died from cancer at age 81, a family death
notice said today.
   The scripts of Thomas Ernest Bennett Clarke, who died in a
hospital on Saturday, played up British eccentricty and were made
into films that were hugely popular around the world.
   In ``Passport to Pimlico,'' the residents of London's Pimlico
district discover they are part of France and declare themselves an
independent state. ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' in 1951 had bank clerk
Alec Guinness robbing the Bank of England of its gold bullion. ``The
Titfield Thunderbolt'' in 1953 showed country dwellers fighting to
preserve their railway line.
   Clarke said he went to the Bank of England for advice on how to
rob it and filled out a form asking, ``Nature of Business.'' He said
the officials were very helpful and he used the method they showed
him in his script.
   Clarke scripted 14 films, including a police drama, ``The Blue
Lamp'' which later became a TV series, and John Ford's only British
film, ``Gideon's Day.'' He co-wrote nine other films and authored 15
books, mostly novels and his 1974 autobiography, ``This Is Where I
Came In.''
   Clarke worked in advertising and journalism and was in the London
police force before turning to films.
   He was a widower and leaves a daughter.

<HEAD>Election Of Woman Bishop Called Turning Point In Ordination Battle</HEAD>

   Religious leaders say there's no turning back from
women in the Episcopal Church hierarchy now that a 2,000-year,
all-male bastion has been broken by the Rev. Barbara C. Harris'
consecration as a bishop.
   Presiding Bishop Edmond Lee Browning, spiritual leader of the
Episcopal Church, said Harris' consecration Saturday ``means that
this church is realizing the wholeness of ministry, the totality of
ministry, and I'm sure that others will be following Barbara in the
days ahead.''
   The Rev. I. Carter Heyward, one of 11 women ``illegally''
ordained in a 1974 service in Philadelphia that paved the way for
the Episcopal Church's approval of women clergy two years later,
said Harris' consecration was ``a major step'' for the denomination.
   ``I think we still have a long way to go,'' she added. ``My
experience in the Episcopal Church is that it really does take some
pushing, and I doubt that that's over.''
   The ceremony made Harris the first woman bishop in the three
denominations that believe in apostolic succession, that church
leadership can be traced to the apostles commissioned by Jesus. The
denominations are the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican
churches. The Episcopal church is one of 28 national branches of the
Anglican communion.
   In her first sermon as a bishop, Harris told 400 worshipers at
the Cathedral Church of St. Paul on Sunday to resist the temptation
to shut their eyes to issues such as racism and AIDS.
   ``If Jesus had not taken risks, we would not be saved,'' said
Harris, who became a priest in 1980 in Philadelphia. ``If the
Diocese of Massachusetts had decided to play it safe, I would not be
here wearing a broche and a chimere and a pectoral cross.''
   While nearly all of the more than 8,000 people who packed the
convention center shouted their approval, others fought to the end
to preserve the all-male tradition.
   John Jamieson, representing a group of conservative Episcopalians
called the Prayer Book Society, said her ``pretended consecration''
holds church laws ``in contempt.''
   The Rev. James Hopkinson Cupit Jr. of New York City said the
election of a woman may represent an ``intractable impediment'' to
relations with other the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox
churches.
   The election of the 58-year-old Harris as suffragan, or assistant
bishop, of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts in September has
been the church's most controversial one in recent years.
   In addition to being the first woman bishop, Harris, who is
black, is thought to be the first bishop elected after a divorce and
the first U.S. bishop, at least in modern times, to lack both a
seminary degree and an undergraduate college degree. She studied
theology through correspondence courses and with tutors, and worked
in corporate public relations.
   While approval of a locally elected bishop is usually perfunctory
for the national church, Harris barely won approval from the
majority of standing committees and head bishops of the 118
dioceses. By Saturday, only 61 standing committees and 66 bishops
had given their consent.
   But that did not matter to Harris when the bishops gathered
around her to consecrate her into their ranks.
   ``I felt during the laying on of hands a part of the ongoing
history of the church. I truly felt in apostolic succession at this
moment,'' she said.
   ``I thought it was absolutely incredibly beautiful and moving,''
said the Rev. Elizabeth Weisner, a Boston priest who is the author
of ``Pilgrim and Pioneer: A Journey With God.''
   She said the diocese has a rough road ahead but, ``I think it's
going to be alright.''
   For many women, the service held a special meaning.
   Millicent Carroll, a 66-year-old church member from Connecticut,
cried when the bishop's mitre was placed on Harris' head.
   ``We didn't think there would be a woman, much less a black
woman,'' said Carroll, who is black.
   ``I feel very, very happy. In my life, I can see the first woman
bishop,'' said the Rev. Florence Tim-Oi Li, 81, the first
clergywoman in the Anglican communion. ``It made me hopeful. Things
are realized now.''
   Ms. Li stopped functioning as a priest in 1946 in response to
pressure from Anglican bishops outside China, where she was ordained
in 1944, but she never gave up her holy orders. On Saturday, she and
other pioneer clergywomen helped consecrate Harris.
   Advocates for women in the ministry said the struggle is not over.
   As of December 1987, according to the Episcopal Church Center,
there were 868 active women priests in the 2.5 million-member
church. The figure is less than the 1,519 women clergy reported by
the 3 million-member Presbyterian Church and the 1,460 women clergy
in the 1.7 million-member United Church of Christ in 1986.
   ``The significant piece is it (Harris' consecration) is another
turning point. It isn't the end,'' said Marge Christie, president of
the Episcopal Women's Caucus. ``Both racism and sexism are still
serious problems in the church, as in the world.''
   Christie said many women are becoming assistants or getting
part-time jobs at churches, but it is still ``almost impossible''
for women to be elected rectors at large churches.

   With the shepherd's crook, robes and miter of an
Episcopal bishop, the Rev. Barbara Harris moves out into a flock
divided over the question of whether she has the right to hold her
newly acquired rank.
   To the duties of ordaining priests, granting communion and
serving as a liaison among parishes in one of the nation's largest
Episcopal dioceses, Barbara Clementine Harris must add the burden of
convincing many doubters within her church and other Christian
denominations that she is suited to her new role.
   It is a challenge that Harris, no stranger to controversy, says
she is ready to take on.
   Following her consecration Saturday as suffragan, or assistant,
bishop in the Boston Episcopal diocese, Harris pledged to try to
heal the divisions in the church created by her new rank.
   ``All of us, in the office of bishop, will be reaching out to as
many people in the diocese and the whole church as we possibly
can,'' said Harris, her voice raspy from a cold. ``I feel good. I'm
looking forward to getting on with my ministry.''
   Harris, 58, became the first woman bishop in any branch of
Christianity that traces its bishops directly to the time of Christ.
   Harris has been involved in church activities throughout her
life. But the first step toward her historic new position may have
been taken in 1974, when Harris led a procession of ``the
Philadelphia 11,'' a group of women Episcopalians who were ordained
priests a full two years before the ordination of women was approved
by the whole church.
   ``I was very much involved in the planning of that service,''
said Harris, who was born and raised in Philadelphia. ``It deeply
affected me.''
   Harris' career in private business and the church led her to
prisons, corporate board rooms, divorce court and the editorial desk
of a feisty, liberal publication.
   Because that path did not include a college or seminary degree
and because of what some view as her extreme left-wing views _ to
say nothing of her gender _ Harris' consecration touched off heated
debate.
   The issue of a woman becoming a bishop would have engendered
debate throughout Christendom regardless who was nominated. But
Harris provoked all the more discussion because of her background.
   Some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as
well as her sex, said Harris, who is black.
   During the 1960s Harris became involved in the civil rights
movement and participated in the Selma, Ala., march led by the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. For a decade beginning in 1958, she worked in
a public relations firm and, beginning in 1968, for Sun Oil Co.'s
public relations department, ending her career there in 1980 as a
senior staff consultant.
   That year Harris assumed the robes of an Episcopal priest and
began a career that took her to counseling sessions in prisons and
sermons in a city parish. In 1984, Harris became executive director
of the Episcopal Church Publishing Co., an organization not
officially sanctioned by the church but one with a considerable
voice through its publication, The Witness.
   It was in the pages of this monthly magazine that Harris became
known to a wider audience through her regular editorials.
   She wrote editorials against South Africa's apartheid policies
and U.S. aid to rebels in Nicaragua. She wrote in favor of
homosexual rights and an end to church discrimination against
homosexuals. She also lambasted conservative wings of the church on
many occasions, sometimes angering as much with her style as with
the substance of her commentary.
   In 1963, after three years of marriage, Harris divorced Raymond
Rollins, which also was cited by some critics.
   She likes classical music and drinks an occasional glass of
chablis. She prefers ``any kind of gourmet food,'' but also likes
soul food, especially black-eyed peas. ``I like cooking up a storm
for a large crowd,'' she said.

   Barbara Harris has taken her place as the first
woman bishop in church that traces its heritage directly to early
days of Christianity, despite a stormy break with Catholicism during
the reign of England's Henry VIII.
   The 2.8 million-member U.S. Episcopal Church developed from the
Church of England and is one of the several independent national
churches that belong to the worldwide Anglican Communion.
   English settlers brought the church to Virginia at the turn of
the 17th century. It became a separate group when it adopted a
constitution and religious laws and a revision of the Book of Common
Prayer in Philadelphia in 1789.
   The Church of England had separated from the Roman Catholic
church in the 16th century after Henry VIII was denied an annulment
to his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, who had no sons.
   Henry secretly married his second of six wives, Anne Boleyn,
rejected the pope's authority in England and appointed Thomas
Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury. Cranmer approved Henry's annulment.
   In 1534, Parliament declared that the pope had no authority in
England and made the Church of England a separate institution.
   The communion contends that its clergy are directly linked to the
apostles of Christ through an unbroken series of ceremonies. Other
denominations claims the same kind of historic succession, including
the Roman Catholic Church.
   The Episcopal Church voted in 1976 to allow women priests. Since
then about 1,200 have been ordained.
   The church is governed by a permanent Executive Council and by
the General Convention, which meets every three years.

   Giving chocolates to your sweetie for
Valentine's Day could result in good chemistry.
   ``A chemical in the chocolate hits a pleasure center in the
brain,'' said George Higgins, a pastry chef instructor at the
8,000-student Johnson &amp; Wales University in Providence, one of the
world's biggest cooking schools. ``As a gift from a lover to a
lover, it would certainly help do the trick.''
   Chocolate contains phenylethylamine, or PEA, a natural
mood-altering chemical also found in the human brain.
   ``Win a lottery, get a promotion, fall in love, especially fall
in love, and your PEA level shoots up. You're optimistic, sociable,
and peppy,'' according to ``Chocolate, An Illustrated History'' by
Marcia and Fredrick Morton. ``But if things go wrong, especially if
something goes wrong in your love life, you turn listless and
depressed because your PEA level is down.''
   ``The taste of chocolate is a sensual pleasure in itself,
existing in the same world as sex,'' sex therapist Ruth Westheimer
wrote in her column, ``Ask Dr. Ruth.''
   But there's also an argument against the romantic effects of
chocolate.
   ``I really wonder whether giving chocolate for Valentine's Day is
really the best type of gift if one wants to pursue any type of
intense, romantic affair,'' said Judith Wurtman, a research
scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's department of
nutrition and food sciences. ``The high fat and the high sugar
content may make you very sleepy.''

   People may love New York, but the Virginia
Division of Tourism wants to make sure the Big Apple knows that
``Virginia Is For Lovers.''
   In an Valentine's-season letter sent to New York City radio and
television stations last week, Virginia tourism officials said: ``We
know that New Yorkers love `I Love New York.' Most of them who come
down here ... wear it on their bumper stickers and think the idea
was invented north of the Hudson. Wrong. `Virginia Is For Lovers'
came first. It dates back to 1969. Yours _ shortened like y'all talk
_ appeared in the 70s.''
   In celebration of the 20th anniversary of its slogan, Virginia is
sending a special message to New Yorkers in the form of a 30-second
electronic cartoon over Times Square.
   The department spent $1,500 on production of the cartoon, and
another $1,500 to run it on the electronic billboard of Times Square
three times an hour between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. on Tuesday.
   The cartoon opens with Uncle Sam getting a kiss on the cheek from
a young lady. A caption beneath the scene reads ``Happy Valentine's
Day America from all your lovers in Virginia.''
   Then, the ``Virginia is for Lovers'' logo appears with the
caption, ``We've been sending America this Valentine message for 20
years.''
   For its part, the New York tourism office plans to release two
new ``I Love New York'' commercials promoting the Big Apple for
Valentine's Day.

   Cupid has been working overtime in this
southwestern Ohio town as Valentine's Day nears.
   Up to 14,000 requests in a year have been sent for a special red
postmark showing the angel of love, the town's name and the slogan
``There is nothing in this world so sweet as love,'' said Terry
Gingrich, director of the Chamber of Commerce
   As its renown for the love-struck grows, more residents of the
community of 10,000 people are getting into the act as volunteer
postmark stampers.
   ``It's involving a lot more people than it has in the past. This
year, we opened it up to the community,'' Gingrich said last week.
``Each piece of mail is handled individually.''
   Although the postmark is available year-round, the mail
requesting it peaks as Feb. 14 approaches. Volunteers stamp the
special postmark by hand on each letter. The Loveland post office
helps publicize the project and asks people to send their prepaid
and pre-addressed mail to Loveland in a larger envelope.
   Loveland resident Doris Pfiester began the project in 1971 and
faithfully pursued it until her 1982 death. Her daughter, Ruth
Jackson, took it over and kept it up. This year, with all the added
volunteer help, she was able to take a vacation.

   But he cautions that risk is indicated by the overall pattern of
responses to all 90 items, rather than to individual ones.
   Subjects are asked to mark ``true'' or ``false'' such items as:
   _ People understand things better when they are drinking alcohol.
   _ It's easier to play sports after a few drinks of alcohol.
   _ Drinking alcohol makes people feel more alert.
   _ Alcohol makes parties more fun.
   _ Drinking alcohol is OK because it allows people to join in with
others who are having fun.
   _ Drinking alcohol makes people more friendly.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen today,
while stock prices declined on profit-taking selling following six
consecutive days of record-high closings.
   Both markets reacted early in the day to a rise Friday in the
U.S. prime lending rate, which pushed the dollar higher but
depressed stock prices. The stock market also reacted negatively to
local political developments.
   The dollar, which fell 1.74 yen last Friday to a closing of
127.65 yen, gained back 0.65 yen on Monday, closing at 128.30 yen.
   After opening at 128.50 yen, the dollar weakened on mid-morning
selling, recovered and later sagged as several banks sold the
currency to protect their bond holdings, said Kaneo Ogino, a trader
at Goldman Sachs. It traded in a range of 128.20-128.63 yen.
   An increase in the prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 11
percent by many American commercial banks and news of an
unexpectedly high U.S. producer price index for January, both
announced Friday, combined to spur the dollar's early rally, said a
dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``Now everyone's paying attention to interest-rate differentials
and inflation, which should be good for the dollar,'' Ogino said.
   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar more
attractive to foreign investors.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 53.56-point gainer Friday, closed 146.67 points,
or 0.4 percent, lower at 31,985.32. It finished last week at a
record high 32,131.99 points.
   Share prices declined in reaction to the interest rate hike and
to the governing Liberal Democratic Party's loss Sunday in a closely
watched parliamentary by-election, said Kazuhiro Nakamura of Wako
Securities.
   ``After the LDP's severe defeat and six straight days of (stock
index) increase, investors felt it was time to ease off,'' Nakamura
said.
   The election to fill the seat of a Liberal Democrat who died in
December was the first race for a national office since the
so-called Recruit stock scandal over financial links between Recruit
Co. and prominent politicians and bureaucrats came to light.
   The election also was seen as an indication of public opinion
toward the governing party following the passage of a long-sought
tax reform package in December that included introduction of an
unpopular 3 percent sales tax.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Jan. 4-12 with 1,162 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3 percentage-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be the within 3 points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5
points, for example, among college graduates.
   Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and
order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of
rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Do you approve or disapprove of the United States holding
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, known as the PLO?
Approve: 67 percent. Disapprove: 17 percent. Don't know or no
answer: 16 percent.
   2. Should Israel negotiate with the PLO, or not? Yes: 62. No: 15.
DK-NA: 24.
   3. Should the Palestinians have their own country, or not? Yes:
62. No: 11. DK-NA: 27.
   4. Do you believe that the PLO has given up terrorism, or do you
think it's only saying that for political advantage? Believe: 6.
Disbelieve: 74. DK-NA: 20.
   5. Do you think the PLO wants to destroy Israel, or do you think
it would accept a Palestinian state coexisting with Israel? Destroy:
33. Coexist: 36. DK-NA: 32.
   6. If the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist, should Israel
give up territory it occupies and allow creation of a Palestinian
state there? Yes: 44. No: 25. DK-NA: 31.
   6a. (If yes to 6) Should Israeli settlers in that territory be
required to leave, or not? Yes: 27. No: 62. DK-NA: 11.
   7. Do you think that only the PLO can represent the Palestinians
in negotiations with Israel, or could some other group do it _ for
example, a delegation of Palestinians and Jordanians? PLO: 11.
Other: 63. DK-NA: 26.
   8. Should the United States try to force Israel to negotiate with
the PLO by threatening sanctions if Israel refuses? Yes: 16. No: 67.
DK-NA: 17.
   9. The PLO has declared the creation of an independent
Palestinian state, without defining its boundaries. Do you think the
United States should recognize that state? Yes: 23. No: 52. DK-NA:
25.
   10. Do you think pro-Israel groups in the United States have too
much influence on United States policy, or too little, or about the
right amount? Much: 35. Little: 8. Right: 32. DK-NA: 25.
   11. How about pro-Palestinian groups in the United States _ do
you think they have too much influence on United States policy, or
too little, or about the right amount? Much: 20. Little: 18. Right:
33. DK-NA: 30.

   Americans widely disbelieve the Palestine
Liberation Organization's claim to have abandoned terrorism but
favor the U.S. dialogue with the PLO and the establishment of a
Palestinian state, a poll shows.
   Nearly seven in 10 respondents to a Media General-Associated
Press survey approved of the United States holding talks with the
PLO, and six in 10 said Israel should follow suit.
   But just 6 percent of the 1,162 adults said they believed the
PLO's recent renunciation of terrorism, and 74 percent said they
thought the group only made that claim for political gain. The rest
were unsure.
   The poll indicated other misgivings about the PLO. Respondents
were split on whether the organization would coexist with Israel or
still seek to destroy it, regardless of its recognition of the
Jewish state in December.
   Still, the public endorsed the basic tenet of the Palestinian
cause: Sixty-two percent said the Palestinians should have their own
country. Eleven percent disgreed. Twenty-seven percent had no
opinion.
   The national poll was conducted Jan. 4-12, the month after PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat said his group was recognizing Israel and
renouncing terrorism. The United States responded to Arafat's move
by opening its first official talks with the PLO.
   Israel rejected the PLO declarations as a ploy and continued its
refusal to negotiate with the organization. The poll found
acceptance of that position: Although most favored such talks, 67
percent said the United States should not try to force Israel to
talk with the PLO.
   But the survey also found some frustration with Israel's
supporters in the United States: 35 percent said they had too much
influence on U.S. policy. Twenty percent said pro-Palestinan groups
had too much influence.
   Roughly a quarter of the respondents had no view on many of the
questions, reflecting the distance of Mideast issues from the daily
concerns of many Americans. Significantly more men expressed
opinions than did women.
   Better-educated respondents were more likely to favor dealings
with the PLO. While 67 percent overall approved of U.S.-PLO talks,
for example, that number swelled to 79 percent of college-educated
respondents.
   Six in 10 of the most-educated group, those who had done
postgraduate study, said Israel should allow the creation of a
Palestinian state on land it occupies in exchange for recognition
from the PLO. Among all respondents, just 44 percent agreed.
   But respondents in all education levels doubted that the PLO has
given up terrorism. And 63 percent overall said some group other
than the PLO could represent the Palestinians in negotiations with
Israel.
   Arab countries have declared the PLO the Palestinians' only
legitimate representative. Israel has said it would negotiate with
Palestinians, but not with PLO members because the organization's
charter calls for Israel's destruction.
   One-third of the respondents thought the PLO wants to destroy
Israel; about a third believed the PLO would coexist with Israel.
The last third weren't sure. More of the most-educated group, 55
percent, said the PLO would coexist with Israel.
   Still, six in 10 of that group, and five in 10 overall, said the
United States should not recognize the Palestinian state the PLO
declared in November. The rest split between support for recognition
and no opinion.
   The poll had a 3 percentage-point margin of error.

   A desert power plant burns enough cow dung to
electrify up to 20,000 homes, thanks to 250,000 cattle, $37 million
in tax-exempt bonds and an environmentalist-lawyer seeking his
fortune as an ``entremanure.''
   It's the first commercial power plant that burns only cattle
chips for fuel, although smaller facilities ``digest'' manure to
produce methane to generate electricity, said Will Parish, founder
and president of National Energy Associates Inc.
   Parish, 36, left his job with a San Francisco law firm to start
the Mill Valley company, which he said is dedicated to ``doing well
by doing good'' by building profitable but socially and
environmentally responsible energy projects.
   The $46 million, 17{-megawatt Mesquite Lake Resource Recovery
Project, financed by the bonds plus $9 million from investors, is
located next to its fuel supply: cattle feedlots near Imperial in
the desert about 110 miles east of San Diego. It fired up in
November 1987 and began continuous on-line electricity production
last October.
   ``It truly is a unique plant,'' said Bill McCroskey, a project
development manager for Southern California Edison Co.
   ``We are presently buying power from them (under a 30-year
contract). The plant satisfactorily passed its operating test last
fall. They are considered a reliable energy source.''
   The plant runs at 70 percent to 85 percent of its maximum
capacity as its construction company, Lurgi Corp. of Frankfurt, West
Germany, ``tweaks'' it toward full net capacity of 15 megawatts,
enough to power 15,000 to 20,000 homes using 800 to 900 tons of
manure daily, Parish said. The plant runs on the other 2{ megawatts
it produces.
   Parish said the plant's output represents annual savings of
300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would be burned for power, and
relieves pressure on Imperial Valley landfills.
   Until the entrepreneur came along, feedlot owners paid to have
manure carted away and dumped. It has little value as fertilizer
because it contains too much salt and weed seeds. Now NEA buys the
dung for $1 per ton from 15 feedlots.
   ``I've been called a manure mogul,'' Parish joked. ``My alma
mater ... referred to me in the alumni notes as the class of 1975's
first `entremanure.'''
   Loaders scoop up manure from some 250,000 cattle, and about 60
trucks deliver it to the Mesquite Lake plant, where ``we stack it
like a precious commodity,'' Parish said.
   Conveyor belts feed 40 tons of manure an hour into the plant,
where it is dried and dropped into special furnaces. The heat
produces more than 150,000 pounds of steam hourly to drive a turbine
and electric generator.
   Because the power plant qualified as a waste recovery operation,
the California Pollution Control Financing Authority issued $37.2
million in bonds to help finance construction. NEA raised $9 million
more by forming a limited partnership. Repayment of the 20-year,
investment-grade bonds is guaranteed by National Westminster Bank
USA.
   ``We have seen a number of unusual proposals, and this is clearly
one of them,'' Keith Seegmiller, the financing authority's deputy
executive secretary, said by phone from Sacramento.
   Parish has called the plant ``a cash cow'' because ``manure costs
a penny a kilowatt hour, and we sell electricity at 7 cents a
kilowatt hour. That translates on an annual basis to a fuel cost of
about $2 million and gross sales of about $10 million, leaving $8
million to cover (other) expenses and profits.''
   While tax-free bonds are attractive, Parish said it wasn't always
easy soliciting partners to invest a minimum of $50,000 each.
   ``I got questions like, `What will happen if the cattle get
constipated?''' Parish recalled.
   The power plant yields about 160 tons of ash daily, but Parish
expects to be selling all of it by year's end as an additive to
paving materials and fertilizer and an absorbent to soak up toxic
contaminants from geothermal energy wells.
   NEA now is building a $60 million, 17-megawatt power plant next
to the manure plant. It will burn manure, wood waste and various
agricultural wastes.

<HEAD>City Seeks To Change Charter That Many Claim Has Divided Tulsa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every few months, David Breed loads a bus
with white people, many of whom have lived in Tulsa all their lives,
and takes them on a tour of the city's northside.
   This is the other Tulsa, where most of the city's poorest
families live, most of the city's low-income housing is located,
much of the city's crime occurs and many of the city's vacant
buildings crumble under neglect.
   This is also where most of the city's blacks live.
   ``The tour is really designed to take people out of their way to
show them a part of Tulsa they otherwise would never see,'' said
Breed, who is a white volunteer in several groups working on
problems in north Tulsa. ``These problems really do exist here.''
   City officials and black leaders hope a proposed change in
government that residents will vote on Tuesday will open City Hall
to northside blacks for the first time and begin redressing some of
those problems.
   Tulsa was once referred to as a ``promised land'' by freed slaves
escaping the South, but a 1987 civil rights lawsuit filed by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People claims
the city has discriminated against blacks for decades.
   The city's 1908 charter established a commission form of
government, with commissioners elected at-large. A black from the
northside has never been elected.
   The lawsuit, filed after the NAACP won a similar case against
officials in Springfield, Ill., claims Tulsa's 42,000 blacks are
ignored in this predominantly white city of 360,000. That lawsuit
could become moot if voters approve a new charter calling for a
strong mayor and a council with members drawn from nine districts,
including one majority black district.
   ``With the very force of his knowledge, his influence, and, yes,
his role in city government, a black councilman will make a
difference to every aspect of this community,'' said Jim Goodwin, a
black attorney assisting the NAACP.
   Tulsa officials vehemently deny the city has discriminated
against blacks. They say the proposed new charter is an attempt to
introduce a more efficient form of government, not a response to the
NAACP.
   Still, they said a history of segregation has had its effect on
the city's largest minority.
   ``There's no doubt but that there was a system of segregation
that effectively kept blacks from being active participants ... in
the local government game in this community,'' Finance Commissioner
Gary Watts said. ``As to how rapidly we have opened up as a
community since the late 1960s, I think there would be a great deal
of debate on that perception.''
   ``I'm still not ready to say that representation has been denied
on a racial basis. I don't believe that,'' Mayor Rodger Randle said.
   Blacks trace the racial problems to events that led to a bloody
1921 riot. After that, Tulsa complied with state segregation laws at
least through the 1960s.
   The riot ``left a legacy of segregation. It left a legacy that
Tulsa would tolerate racism,'' said Dr. Charles Christopher, a black
leader. ``It has left a second class of citizens that has not been
treated fairly. It has left a legacy of two separate school
systems.''
   ``This city has been so successful in segregation, most Tulsans
don't even acknowledge it's here; some probably don't even realize
it,'' said state Rep. Don Ross, a black native of north Tulsa. ``But
just walk through City Hall, walk through any company. Go into any
of the industrial parks in this community and you'll see it.''
   ``This is not the legal discrimination that I knew as a child,''
said Ross, who was born in 1941. ``There is today a more rigid,
covert line of discrimination that is more damaging.''
   A 1985 city development study highlighted the damage in the
northside, home to three-quarters of Tulsa's blacks. It found the
median family income in north Tulsa is only about half that of the
rest of Tulsa County and that the median value of homes in the area
was less than half that in the rest of the county. Unemployment was
twice as high as the rest of the county and twice as many of the
area's workers held minimum-wage service jobs.
   The mayor said he is optimistic voters will embrace the charter,
despite the failure of four previous attempts at change since 1954,
because many people realize the limitations of the current system.
   ``It's a time when we should have government by leadership
instead of government by committee,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Two Shuttle Astronauts Received Medical Waivers To Fly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The astronaut who commanded the first shuttle
mission since the Challenger disaster had a kidney stone, which
should have kept him from space, a newspaper reported.
   Another astronaut who is scheduled to command a November mission
is colorblind, a reason for flight disqualification, but received a
waiver to fly, the Houston Chronicle reported Sunday.
   The Johnson Space Center medical qualification board recommended
last year that Discovery commander Frederick H. Hauck be
disqualified because of the kidney stone but was overruled by Rear
Adm. Richard H. Truly, NASA's associate administrator for flight
operations in Washington, the newspaper reported.
   The board also said Daniel C. Brandenstein, chief of the
astronaut corps, failed an eye test in 1987 but received a waiver
after Truly interceded, the newspaper reported.
   A chief NASA administrator said no rules were broken in allowing
the astronauts to fly.
   ``There have been no special dispensations and there has been no
favoritism and there have been no medically disqualified astronauts
assigned to the space shuttle missions,'' said Aaron Cohen, Johnson
Space Center's director.
   The newspaper said it obtained the information from members of
the Flight Crew Operations, which includes the astronaut office, and
the Space and Life Sciences Directorate, which includes the flight
medicine clinic and medical operations branch at the space center.
   Truly declined to comment on individual medical cases, but said:
``I try to do two things. I try to make sure from the management
view that the (medical) process works, that individual health
problems are treated fairly by the (medical qualification) board and
management, and secondly to protect the rights of the individual
involved, and the major objective is to get healthy astronauts to
the launch pad for the mission.''
   During October interviews and last week, Hauck and Brandenstein
would not discuss their medical records, the newspaper said.
   The Space Medicine Board grounded Hauck early last year because
of a kidney stone problem; the recommendation was overruled and
subsequently reversed, the newspaper reported.
   Brandenstein failed the Farnsworth Lantern color perception test
in 1987, but received the only waiver ever issued to an astronaut
for color blindness, it said.
   The approximately 2,000 circuit breakers and switches on the
shuttle orbiter are color-coded, and some are used in the launch and
re-entry, an unidentified source told the newspaper.
   Brandenstein is scheduled to command the Columbia space shuttle
in November. He has flown on two previous shuttle flights, in 1983
and in 1985.
   Hauck flew on shuttle flights in 1983 and 1984, as well as
commanding Discovery's September mission. He has said that the
Discovery flight was his last shuttle flight.
   The Chronicle said Hauck underwent a lithotripsy at Houston's
Methodist Hospital in April to dissolve a kidney stone. The process,
however, doesn't guarantee that another kidney stone will not form.

   A mild earthquake early today shook a
wide area of San Francisco, the sixth tremor in Northern California
within 24 hours, officials said.
   No damage or injuries were immediately reported from the quakes,
whose magnitudes ranged from 2.4 to 3.0 on the Richter scale.
   The sixth quake struck at 12:01 a.m. and had a magnitude of 3.0
on the Richter scale, according to the United States Geological
Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   It was centered west of the Golden Gate Bridge, the same area as
two earlier ones, said seisomologist Anthony Lomax of the University
of California Seismology Station.
   ``We had several calls from all over the city but so far no
reports of damage,'' said a San Francisco police dispatcher who
declined to give his name.
   The first quake, which measured 2.7 on the Richter scale, struck
at 11:49 a.m. Sunday and was centered about five miles west of the
bridge.
   Within two minutes, two more quakes, measuring 2.6 and 2.4 on the
Richter scale, were felt in southern Marin County, Lomax said.
   At 10 p.m., a magnitude 3.0 quake struck the same general area
off the Golden Gate as the first one, Lomax said.
   A quake that measured 2.9 was centered near San Leandro, about 10
miles south of Berkeley, at 10:41 p.m., he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 measured an estimated 8.3 on
the Richter scale.

   When the first two black families moved into the
virtually all-white housing projects of south Boston last summer,
they were accompanied by police.
   After weeks of protests by neighbors and extensive news coverage,
city officials feared a replay of the 1970s riots over the busing of
blacks to schools in the working class section. Instead, more than
six months later, the two families report little enmity and much
hospitality.
   ``I'm just a neighbor like anyone else,'' said Elizabeth
Clinkscales, 37, who lives in a three-bedroom apartment with her
20-year-old daughter, Anjanette, and grandson, Jahman, 4.
   ``I haven't experienced much animosity since I've been here. I
think south Boston's in a healing process now.''
   The move for Clinkscales and the family of Bessie Payne, 36, was
made easier because the two have been friends since high school.
   Coincidentally, they were both given eviction notices about the
same time and applied for emergency housing with the Boston Housing
Authority.
   ``My main focus at that time was not to become homeless, not to
go into a shelter,'' said Clinkscales, who works as an assistant at
a day-care center and pays $225 a month for her apartment. ``To me
that was just as frightening as moving to south Boston.''
   Payne tells a similar story.
   ``I couldn't see myself in a shelter with the children and I saw
no reason to be when BHA had a three-bedroom apartment available,''
Payne said.
   Until recently, the projects in the predominantly Irish Catholic
neighborhood known as Southie were 98 percent white and 2 percent
non-black minorities. But since the Clinkscales and Paynes moved
into Southie, several other black families have been placed in the
projects.
   It was in the same neighborhood, separated from downtown by a
harbor channel, where years of protests erupted after court-ordered
busing in 1974. Whites stoned buses of black children shuttled from
the Roxbury section.
   After federal authorities told Boston officials to desegregate
the projects last year, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn held meetings in
south Boston to urge acceptance of the plan. Instead, they booed
Flynn, a south Boston native, and called him a traitor.
   When Clinkscales and Payne moved in last July, the city had
developed a long-term ``safety plan'' for them in case of trouble.
For the first week, the two families were told to check in with
police when they left their apartments and when they returned.
   ``My image was that there was some prejudice here but I'm the
type of person who realizes there's prejudice everywhere,'' said
Clinkscales.
   Clinkscales and Payne said in recent interviews that little has
happened to make them feel like the targets of bigotry.
   ``When I moved in, I expected a lot of turbulence,'' said Payne,
37, who is an administrator at a church, and shares her apartment
with her son, Kimani Poles, 14, and daughter, Dadizi Poles, 9.
``When it didn't happen, I was really grateful. I think the people
here are willing to accept change now.''
   The two said they give each other moral support with daily phone
calls. Yet the only disturbing incident for both came when
teen-agers once yelled racial slurs outside their apartments. They
said it occurred just once.
   Clinkscales' daughter, Anjanette, said she and her mother
exchanged Christmas gifts with the Mahoney family next door and
counts 18-year-old Kerry Mahoney as a friend.
   ``I was surprised at how nice they were,'' said Kerry Mahoney,
who said she had never known a black family until the Clinkscales
moved in.

<HEAD>Four Arrested in Stock-Trading Scandal That Has Shaken Gov't</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of Recruit Co. and three other
businessmen were arrested today in a stock-trading scandal that has
shaken Japan's governing party and contributed to its loss in a
special parliamentary election.
   The country's largest opposition party, victorious in Sunday's
by-election, demanded today that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
resign or dissolve parliament ``so the people can express their
will'' about the Recruit scandal.
   Takako Doi, head of the Japan Socialist Party, told parliament
her party's victory in the election in Fukuoka in southern Japan
showed that public has lost faith in the corruption-tainted
Takeshita adminstration.
   The balloting was widely seen as a test of the damage done by the
scandal.
   Takeshita refused to dissolve the legislature, which would mean
calling new elections for its lower house.
   Recruit reportedly sold tens of thousands of unlisted shares of
stock at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and other
prominent people. The purchasers then profited when the stocks were
publicly traded and skyrocketed in value. The scandal has also
involved direct political donations by Recruit.
   Prosecutors said they today arrested Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and
former chairman of the information services conglomerate. Also
arrested were a vice president of a Recruit subsidiary and to former
officials of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest company.
   The Recruit officials were arrested on suspicion of giving
bribes, the two Nippon officials in connection with receiving
bribes, news reports said.
   Prosecutors said Ezoe was taken from a hospital where he had been
under treatment for exhaustion since the scandal was uncovered last
summer.
   Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other prominent
politicians and businessmen have since resigned in the scandal,
which has led to broader questions about political fund-raising and
links between business and politics.
   ``The election (Sunday) showed that people in Fukuoka won't put
up with any more (of Takeshita's policies),'' Ms. Doi told cheering
opposition lawmakers today. ``Either the entire Cabinet must resign,
or the prime minister must dissolve parliament so the people can
express their will.''
   A dissolution of Japan's parliament, the Diet, would force an
election for the lower house, where Takeshita's governing Liberal
Democratic Party has more than 300 of the 512 seats. An election is
scheduled in July for half of the seats in the upper house, which
cannot be dissolved.
   In Sunday's race, Socialist Sadao Fuchigami defeated Liberal
Democrat Kei Oma by 751,036 to 564,301 votes. The special election
was called after the incumbent Liberal Democratic lawmaker died in
December.
   The election was the first for a national office since the
Recruit scandal came to light last summer and the Liberal Democrats
pushed a controversial 3 percent sales tax through parliament in
December.
   The unpopular tax, which takes effect in April, reduces Japan's
heavy reliance on direct taxes by cutting corporate and upper-level
income taxes.
   The voting was seen as an indicator of what might happen in the
July upper house elections. Severe setbacks in the July elections
could endanger Takeshita's chances next October to win another
two-year term as party president and prime minister.
   Takeshita said he would undertake political reform to restore the
people's trust in politics.
   ``I will stake everything on political reform. I will carry it
out tenaciously and patiently without considering a dissolution (of
parliament) or a resignation of the Cabinet,'' he told parliament.
   Ms. Doi called for a ban on corporate political contributions and
added: ``Instead of political reform, let's have political ethics.''
   The Recruit scandal erupted when it was disclosed that Ezoe sold
unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary more than 150
influential politicians, bureacrats and journalists before public
trading in the shares began.
   The share prices then rose sharply in value and some of the
purchasers made more than $80,000 in tax-free profits. Although the
sales were not illegal in themselves, they raised questions of
possible bribery and influence-peddling.

<HEAD>Rocket Pioneer Says He Was `Dumb' To Accept U.S. Exile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NASA pioneer who helped develop the
rocket that took men to the moon says he was ``very dumb'' to
renounce his U.S. citizenship rather than fight charges that he
committed war crimes in Nazi Germany.
   Arthur Rudolph, 82, is seeking a temporary visa so he can attend
an Apollo space program reunion at the Alabama Space and Rocket
Center in Huntsville. He was project manager of the Apollo Saturn 5
rocket.
   The Justice Department accused Rudolph of playing a role in the
deaths of thousands of concentration camp prisoners during World War
II, charges he denies.
   ``I did not have the financial resources to go through a lengthy
court trial and I did not know if after 40 years I could still find
any witnesses to rebut the charges against me,'' he said in an
interview last week with The Birmingham News at his home outside
Hamburg, West Germany.
   Rudolph renounced his United States citizenship at Hamburg's
American consulate in May 1984 after agreeing to return to West
Germany following a series of interviews with the Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigations.
   He called that decision ``dumb, very dumb,'' the newspaper
reported Sunday.
   Rudolph regained his West German citizenship last year after a
lengthy West German investigation concluded he had committed no war
crimes.
   As a member of Nazi Germany's von Braun rocket team during World
War II and a member of the Nazi Party, Rudolph was in charge of
production of the V-2 missile in the underground Mittelwerk factory
about 140 miles south of Hamburg. The area is now part of East
Germany.
   The Justice Department said thousands of concentration camp
prisoners were worked to death or executed at Mittelwerk. It charged
that Rudolph influenced what happened there.
   Rudolph, who was living in retirement in California when the
charges were made, said he ``never pleaded guilty but they talk
anyway about alleged things that I did, not proven, and I'm not
guilty.''
   Walter Haeussermann, who worked with Rudolph in Nazi Germany and
again in development of NASA rockets at Huntsville, said the
campaign for restoration of Rudolph's U.S. citizenship would
continue, but that efforts would focus now on his request for a
temporary visa.
   ``We think the fight for (Rudolph's) exoneration may take longer
and we would like to get permission for him to visit here even
temporarily to be part of the reunion _ the United States owes him
that,'' Haeussermann said.
   In exchange for Rudolph's agreement to leave rather than fight
the accusations, the Justice Department agreed not to challenge the
American citizenship of his wife, Martha, who lives with him in
Hamburg, or his daughter, Marianne, who works for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration in Southern California.
   Rudolph also was allowed to keep his NASA pension and medical
insurance coverage.

<HEAD>Maryland Legislature Rethinking Confidentiality Privileges For Pedophiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators are having second thoughts
about a unique law that grants confidentiality to pedophiles who
confess to psychiatrists.
   Although the legislature removed some privileges last year,
Maryland remains the only state that grants patient-doctor privilege
if the pedophile discloses sexual abuse of children, or even simple
child abuse, that occurred before seeking treatment from a
psychiatrist who specializes in treating pedophilia.
   Dr. Fred Berlin, head of the Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders
Clinic, said in a recent interview that if he were required by law
to report a pedophile's past, that person probably wouldn't come
forward for treatment.
   He and others in his specialty won special confidentiality
privileges from the General Assembly in 1987 to encourage pedophiles
to get help.
   Now, the lawmakers want to force psychiatrists to report
instances of past abuse that a pedophile reveals at any time _ even
at his initial psychiatric evaluation.
   Child advocates and social services officials backing the bill
maintain it's more important to protect a child's rights than to
guarantee any privacy to the offender.
   Stuart Comstock-Gay, the Maryland American Civil Liberties
Union's executive director, said the bill presents ``an interesting
privacy issue.''
   The state ACLU has yet to take a final position on the proposed
change, which passed the Senate last month. The House has yet to
schedule debate on the bill.
   ``There's always a balance between individual rights and another
interest in the public safety and public health,'' Comstock-Gay said.
   ``I'm sure on the surface, it must seem it's good for children to
report (the abuse), and bad not to,'' said Berlin, who believes more
abuse may be uncovered by encouraging pedophiles to enter treatment.
   Noting that clergymen who counsel pedophiles and lawyers who
refer them to psychiatrists for treatment are not compelled by law
to report them, he added: ``My concern is that people who otherwise
might have come forward would be deterred from doing so.''
   For example, without the assurance of confidentiality, one of his
patients, an attorney involved sexually with his daughter, never
would have sought help, nor would therapists necessarily have gotten
his daughter into counseling, Berlin said.
   ``There's no way he wanted to risk being disbarred. He very much
wanted treatment,'' Berlin said.
   Howard Davidson, director of the American Bar Association's
National Legal Resource Center for Child Advocacy and Protection in
Washington, believes some abuse could remain hidden by such
privileged communications.
   ``It concerns me that the balance with that sort of law tips
toward protection of the offender,'' said Davidson. ``What about the
rights of all of his victims?''
   State Sen. Walter Baker, who introduced the bill to strip the
reporting exemption, subscribes to the once-a-pedophile,
always-a-pedophile school of thought.
   ``Everybody admits they (pedophiles) can't be cured,'' Baker
said. ``I am of the opinion that they can't even be treated. I'd
rather see them in jail, that's where they belong.''
   However, Berlin believes his program of intensive psychotherapy,
in tandem sometimes with hormone treatments, can curb pedophilia.
   He also said that when a patient appears to be a danger to
others, he won't hesitate to commit him to a hospital ward for sex
offenders.
   ``It's so easy to be in the corner where you seem to be against
kids, or victims. When things get pigeon-holed, it puts pressure on
legislators, and it certainly makes it uncomfortable for me,''
Berlin said. ``I don't think there's a cure, but I do believe
people, with help, can control themselves appropriately. It's like
alcoholism; today we have the Betty Ford Clinic.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Iranian emigres marking the 10th
anniversary of the Islamic revolution shouted ``Death to Khomeini''
and cheered as the shah's son's called for restoration of the
Peacock Throne.
   ``This is the day to honor the memory of all our compatriots who
lost their lives in war, in prisons and in the torture chambers of
this bloodthirsty regime,'' Prince Reza Pahlavi told the crowd of
about 12,000.
   The rally inside the Los Angeles Sports Arena came a day after a
massive demonstration in Tehran, Iran, where up to 4 million people
celebrated Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's leadership, who overthrew
the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and chanted ``Death to
America.''
   The pro-shah rally was staged in Los Angeles because the city has
the largest Iranian population outside Iran, with an estimated
500,000 expatriates living here. Several thousand Iranians marched
through central London on Saturday to support the prince's
restoration.
   Iranian businessmen handed out free tickets to the Los Angeles
rally. Those entering were frisked by police after passing through
metal detectors.
   Thousands waved green, white and red flags flags bearing the
symbol of the shah's regime, stomped their feet, clapped and chanted
anti-Khomeini slogans.
   Pahlavi, 28, took the stage to thunderous applause, holding his
hands over his head in fists, blowing kisses and tossing roses into
the crowd.
   He said Khomeini's regime has ``spilled the blood of hundreds of
thousands of Iranians,'' and ``caused the wholesale destruction of
the country.''
   He said all Iranians should come together and work to return the
royal family to power.
   ``It is time for our intellectuals, our youth, our talented and
experienced compatriots who have been forced into exile ... to enter
the stage of history, to lead and organize, to encourage cooperation
while respecting diversity of tastes and ideology,'' he said.
   Pahlavi said the end of Iran's war with Iraq presents an ideal
opportunity for Iranians to unite.
   ``The war with Iraq had kept our collective attention focused on
an external enemy. With the end of war, the bankruptcy of the regime
is ever more evident,'' Pahlavi said.
   Pahlavi conducted his entire 40-minute speech in Farsi. English
translations were provided.

<HEAD>Brown Returns to Politics in Election as State Chair</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerry Brown is back in the political
arena after a six-year absence, promising as state Democratic
chairman to combine old-fashioned organizing and modern electronic
marketing to expand party ranks.
   The 50-year-old former governor and two-time candidate for the
Democratic nomination for president won his first election in more
than a decade by defeating investment banker Steve Westly, a
longtime volunteer unknown outside of party circles, by 1,591 votes
to 777 at the state party's annual convention Saturday night.
   ``It feels very good. It feels great. It's been six years, but it
feels like six months,'' Brown said as he ended the self-imposed
political exile that followed his loss to Republican Pete Wilson in
the 1982 U.S. Senate race.
   The vote for the previously obscure unpaid post of party chair
was Brown's first election victory since he won his second term as
governor in 1978. He lost a series of presidential primaries in 1980
and then was defeated for the Senate in 1982.
   He said he hopes to run for other, unspecified offices, but not
during his current four-year term.
   Brown said he is seriously devoted to ``the nuts and bolts of
party work,'' and he set an agenda that included redefining
Democratic constituencies, reviving the local Democratic clubs that
thrived in the 1950s and utilizing computer and telephone marketing
strategies of the 1990s.
   ``It's my objective to build a party that links together the
elected officials and the grassroots activists,'' he said.
   ``We have to energize and mobilize that party of non-voters, who
are our natural clientele. Many are low-income voters who have not
had a strong connection with the voting process,'' Brown said. ``At
the same time ... we have to reach out to the suburban voter and
those who have been tending in the Reagan era to go against our
candidates.''
   Westly argued that Brown would be ``a lightning rod for political
criticism,'' breathing new life into Republican attacks against
controversial events of Brown's tenure as governor, such as his
appointment of unpopular former Chief Justice Rose Bird.
   Other critics said Brown's notoriously chaotic administrative
style didn't suit the detail-oriented duties of a state chairman,
and they questioned Brown's new interest in a formal party structure
that he shunned when he was governor.
   Brown acknowledged those criticisms, alternately joking about his
reputation and seriously promising that he has reflected on his
successes and failure during the six years he has spent out of the
public eye writing, meditating and traveling around the world.
   ``I can become the media dark hole that absorbs all the negative
feedback and allows our candidate for governor to go on to victory
unscathed,'' Brown told the convention in an acceptance speech.

   The dollar rose in quiet European trading this
morning and gold prices fell.
   One currency trader at a major U.S. commercial bank in Milan,
Italy, said the dollar received considerable support from Friday's
release of statistics showing a large-than-expected 1 percent
increase in U.S. producer prices in January.
   The figures boosted expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve
will soon raise interest rates, a move which would reinforce the
dollar, the trader said.
   He said Friday's figures neutralized much of the negative
reaction to President Bush's budget speech, which contained few new
ideas on how to trim the U.S. budget deficit.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.65 yen to a closing 128.30. Later, in London, it

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Church Leader Joins Detainees' Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a
prominent anti-apartheid leader, said today he has begun an
indefinite fast in solidarity with black detainees staging a hunger
strike to demand their freedom.
   ``None of us wish to die,'' Boesak said in a letter to Law and
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok. ``But if this is the road we must take
to make you and your government understand the evil of your ways, we
will take it.''
   Nearly 300 detainees held without charge are participating in the
hunger strike, including some who have not eaten for three weeks.
Thirteen reportedly have been hospitalized.
   Police headquarters said today that news articles about the
physical condition of the hunger strikers might violate
state-of-emergency regulations, which prohibit unauthorized reports
about the status of detainees, unrest, security force actions and a
broad range of statements the government considers subversive.
   Police also have banned any public meetings intended to show
support for the hunger strikers. But Boesak, a mixed-race minister
who is president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, said he
planned to hold a solidarity church service this week.
   The hunger strikers, who demand to be freed or charged, include
105 detainees at St. Albans prison in Port Elizabeth and about 170
at Diepkloof Prison outside Johannesburg. Some have been held
without charge since the state of emergency was declared in June
1986.
   Boesak released a copy of a letter he has written to Vlok
explaining his decision to fast in support of the hunger strikers.
   ``Their action is a dramatic one which could have fateful
consequences for all of us in this country,'' said Boesak, 43, who
was detained for three weeks in 1985 for anti-apartheid activities.
``It is in itself an extraordinary indictment of your government,
most especially your system of detention without trial.''
   ``Fasting until death is not part of my religious or
ecclesiastical tradition,'' Boesak said. ``But I cannot stand idly
by and watch those are struggling for justice in South Africa starve
themselves to death ... I now know what God wants me to do.''
   Boesak said: ``I know first hand of the pain and uncertainty of
the terror of solitary confinement and the unspeakable indignity and
fear it brings.
   He called on other South Africans to join the hunger strike.
   The South African Council of Churches, to which Boesak is
affiliated, issued a statement today urging the release of all
detainees and saying ministers should be allowed to visit the hunger
strikers.
   On Sunday, relatives of the St. Albans strikers held an emotional
church service in New Brighton, a black township adjoining Port
Elizabeth, to support the demands for freedom.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   An airline ticket agent at piled up 1.7 million
bonus air miles via computer without leaving the ground, then sold
the credits for more than $20,000, according to a published report.
   Ralf Kwaschni, 28, was arrested Sunday when he arrived for work
at Kennedy International Airport and was charged with computer
tampering and grand larceny, authorities said.
   Kwaschni, a ticket agent for Lufthansa Airlines, used to work for
American Airlines, the Daily News reported today. Police said he
used his computer access code to create 18 fake American Airline
Advantage Accounts _ racking up 1.7 million bonus air miles,
according to the newspaper.
   All 18 accounts, five in Kwaschni's name and 13 under fake ones,
listed the same post office box, according to the newspaper.
   Instead of exchanging the bonus miles for all the free travel,
Kwaschni sold some of them for $22,500 to brokers, who used the
credits to get a couple of first-class, round-trip tickets from New
York to Australia, two more between London and Bermuda and one
between New York and Paris, the newspaper said.
   It is legitimate to sell personal bonus miles to brokers, Port
Authority Detective Charles Schmidt said.
   Kwaschni would create accounts under common last names, the
newspaper said. When a person with one of the names was aboard an
American flight and did not have an advantage account, the
passenger's name would be eliminated from the flight list and
replaced with one from the fake accounts, the newspaper said.
   ``As the plane was pulling away from the gate, this guy was at
the computer, literally wiping out passengers,'' Schmidt said.

<HEAD>Case Involving Abortion on Comatose Woman Expands Legal Perspectives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANHASSET, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abortion on a comatose woman has not
ended the legal debate that began when her husband sought court
permission to arrange the operation he hopes will help his wife's
recovery.
   The abortion was performed Saturday on 32-year-old Nancy Klein
after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall refused to issue
a stay sought by anti-abortion activists.
   Emotions ran high on both sides throughout the more than two-week
debate.
   ``It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go
on with my life,'' said Martin Klein of New York's Long Island after
the abortion at North Shore University Hospital that ended his
wife's 18-week pregnancy.
   He began court proceedings Jan. 26 to become his wife's guardian
so he could order an abortion, which doctors said offered Mrs. Klein
the best hope of recovery from severe brain damage suffered in a
Dec. 13 car accident.
   ``We are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the
operation went smoothly,'' said Mrs. Klein's mother, Anne Zusselman
of Delray Beach, Fla. ``Now we are hopeful that Nancy's condition
will improve and that we can move on to therapy for her.''
   Meanwhile, anti-abortion activist John Short vowed to press the
appeal with the full Supreme Court to set a precedent so similar
cases would not occur. Short and other activists had found doctors
who said having the baby would not have affected Mrs. Klein's
condition any more than having an abortion.
   But a state appeals court ruling may have dealt a blow to
opponents who have attempted to intervene in cases where they
apparently have no clear-cut interest legally, some lawyers said.
   ``One of the important aspects of this case is that it is the
first time a court has squarely said to these pro-life groups: It is
inappropriate to interfere in the private decisions of a family,''
said Elizabeth Bradford, an assistant state attorney general whose
office was called in to participate in the proceedings.
   The Appellate Division of the State of New York called Short and
Broderick ``absolute strangers'' who, ``whatever their motivation,
have no place in the midst of a family tragedy.''
   ``This case has marked a slight departure from previous existing
law that stated that fathers do not have the right to determine
whether a woman should have an abortion,'' said Anthony D'Auria, an
attorney for North Shore.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Klein remained in guarded condition and all signs
were stable, said a hospital spokesman.
   Her family is considering moving her to rehabilitation facilities
in New Jersey, near where Klein's sister lives, or in Boston. One of
the reasons Klein sought the abortion, he said, is that some
facilities would not accept his wife if she were pregnant.
   ``I couldn't bear to be that far away from Nancy,'' said Klein.

<HEAD>Former President Eats Lunch at His Desk, Works on Speeches, Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan says there is
``no such thing as an average day'' since he left the White House
and began work on memoirs, speeches and post-presidential
politicking.
   ``We're glad to be home with our family and friends and are
enjoying getting back to a more normal life _ for example, going to
church on Sundays,'' Reagan said in answering written questions for
the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. A story about his responses was
published in today's editions of the newspaper.
   ``In Washington, it had been decided our going to church
represented a threat to too many people in these times of
terrorism,'' he said.
   The Reagans were applauded when they showed up at Bel-Air
Presbyterian Church the weekend after returning to California and
their new Bel-Air home after he left office last month.
   Reagan, 78, keeps an office atop a Century City skyscraper, where
he works on speeches, for which he'll be paid $50,000 each, believed
to be the highest fee in the country. He also is compiling a book of
speeches to be published by Simon and Schuster and is to write his
memoirs for the same publisher.
   Contrary to earlier reports that suggested a ghost writer would
be employed, the former president insisted he will do the work
himself.
   ``I always intended to write my memoirs,'' Reagan said, ``because
I believe the story of any presidency is best told by the
president.''
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan is nearing completion of her
memoirs, due to be published in the fall.
   ``There is really no such thing as an average day for either of
us,'' Reagan said. ``Lunch is soup or a sandwich at my desk, and
then back to work.''
   The former president said most days at the new office begin with
a meeting with his staff of 12, most of them former White House
aides. He spends six to seven hours a day with meetings and writing.
   Mrs. Reagan's schedule is also busy, including appearances for
the anti-drug campaign she began in the White House. A drug
treatment center bearing her name is planned for the San Fernando
Valley.
   Like his wife, Reagan has named some issues, including abolishing
the two-term limit on the presidency, he will address in his
post-White House years.
   ``My change of address has not diminished my interest in these
issues,'' he said.

   A teen-ager, apparently angry at being turned
away from a ``Sweet 16'' party, opened fire on 40 people standing on
a Bronx subway platform, wounding six people, police said.
   Four men and two teen-age girls were wounded, said Al O'Leary, a
Transit Police spokesman. One of the men, who was shot in the
stomach, was in critical condition, while the others were in
satisfactory condition, he said.
   The gunman, described by witnesses as about 17 years old, fired a
9mm automatic pistol on a crowded Bronx subway platform at about 1
a.m. Sunday, O'Leary said. The attacker fled and no arrests were
made.
   The shooting may have been in retaliation for not being allowed
to attend the party nearby, said Transit Police Chief of Detectives
Charles Mills. At least one of the victims had attended the party.
   Derrick Jackson, a resident of Tracey Towers, the large housing
development where the party took place, said he saw about 25 people
get off a subway car at about 12:30 a.m. and walk toward the party.
   ``Apparently, they couldn't get into the party so they came back
downstairs,'' Jackson said. ``That's when they started going up the
block. About 10 minutes after they went up the block, I heard
gunshots.''

   A supersonic Concorde jet en route to New York with
69 passengers returned to Paris after cracks appeared in a porthole
as the plane was about halfway across the Atlantic, Air France said
today.
   Air France Flight 001 was at 59,000 feet and had just reached
supersonic speed Sunday when the cracks were noticed at the top of
the outermost of four glass plates in one porthole, said Air France
spokesman Laurent Kressman.
   He did not know who first noticed the cracks about 90 minutes
into the 3 hour and 45 minute flight.
   The pilot slowed the jet, dropped to 32,000 feet and returned to
Charles de Gaulle airport, Kressman said.
   Passengers were put aboard another Concorde, but the plane was
delayed and travelers on the high-tech jet arrived about nine hours
after the normal trans-Atlantic Air France flight to New York.
   ``They were not very, very happy,'' said Kressman.
   The window was repaired and the jet was scheduled to make its
regular 11 a.m. flight today, he said.
   Air France has seven of the 100-seat supersonic jets. British
Airways has just completed a maintenance check on its seven jets
after small cracks were found in the roof structure of one plane.

<HEAD>Jewish Cultural Center Opens in Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet Jews celebrated a measure of religious
freedom with the opening of the first Jewish community center in the
Soviet Union in 50 years.
   Soviet Jews and Jewish leaders from 70 nations filled the
building in downtown Moscow on Sunday for the opening.
   Elie Wiesel, an author and winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize,
said the reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made the center
possible.
   ``Today is a time to say `thank you,''' Wiesel said. ``I think he
deserves our trust.''
   The opening of the Solomon Mikhoels Cultural Center, named after
a Soviet Jewish actor who died in the Stalinist oppression in 1948,
represents a significant change in relations between the government
and the country's 1.8 million Jews.
   It came just a few days after a Soviet newspaper made a major
admission: that Soviet Jews have suffered discrimination for decades
and that dictator Josef Stalin destroyed Jewish culture in the
country.
   The center is in the Moscow Jewish Musical Theater on Taganka
Square in the southeastern section of the capital.
   For Jews, greater tolerance by the Kremlin has meant a rise in
emigration _ including an eight-year high of 20,000 in 1988 _ less
harassment at Jewish holiday celebrations and the opening of a
private Jewish museum and library in Moscow.
   World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman also praised
Gorbachev, saying his reforms made it possible to ``hope for a great
revival of Jewish culture and religion in the U.S.S.R.''
   But he added it will be some years before Soviet Jews overcome
their fear of religious repression in the Soviet Union, where the
teaching of Hebrew was once outlawed. He also expressed worry that
the cultural center could become the target of anti-Semitism.
   Wiesel said he still hopes ``to see in history books a
recognition that the main victims of Hitler were Jewish _ because
they were Jewish, not because they were Communists and Russian
citizens.''
   Sunday's ceremony drew Jewish leaders from around the world,
including former Soviet refusenik Yuli Edelstein, now an executive
of the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum in Israel; World Jewish Congress
vice president Isi Leibler of Australia; and Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean
of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.
   The cultural center is particularly important because decades of
repression have left most of the Soviet Union's Jews with virtually
no knowledge of their religion, history and culture.
   ``Soviet Jews are not really Jews,'' said Edelstein, who served
three years in prison for teaching Hebrew.
   The cultural center opened with a photo exhibit on the Holocaust.
Organizers hope to offer classes in Yiddish and Hebrew, films,
exhibits, music and a cafe featuring Jewish food, said director
Mikhail Gluz.
   The ambassadors of the United States, Australia, Canada, Great
Britain and France also spoke at the ceremony. Israel, which does
not have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union but which has
had warmer contacts with Moscow in recent months, sent Arie Levin,
head of its consular mission in Moscow.

   A seventh member of the group, Nicole Esaly, 47, escaped the
avalanche Sunday in the Sierra Nevada mountains north of Granada.
   Barrionuevo said the avalanche covered a surface of about 240
square yards on a slope below Mulhacen peak to a depth of about 990
feet.
   More than 20 civil guard workers, aided by a helicopter, searched
the area today.

   An 11-year-old boy who fell through ice on
the Great Miami River and was submerged for about 30 minutes could
survive the ordeal, according to doctors.
   Deon Jones of Dayton was listed in critical condition today at
Children's Medical Center. Doctors said he began breathing again
after rescuers pulled him from the icy water just north of downtown
Sunday afternoon.
   ``We believe he was under about 30 minutes,'' said Dr. Richard
Donnini, who treated the boy before he was tranferred to Children's
Medical Center. ``He does have a pulse and he is starting to
respond. He does have a chance.''
   Jones fell through the ice sometime after 1:30 p.m. Sunday,
according to Dayton police. Two other children who were with him ran
to get help, and fire department divers used extension ladders laid
over the ice to rescue Jones, who was about 50 feet from shore,
authorities said.
   Jones ``was face down in the water,'' said firefighter Tom
Bourquin. ``His jacket was making him float a little bit.''
   Officials said the cold water, which can reduce many body
functions and thus limit the need for oxygen, gives the boy a better
chance.
   District Fire Chief Jim Dunham estimated the boy had been under
water 20 to 30 minutes and appeared to not be breathing when placed
in the amblance.
   ``This is one we can save. If he hasn't been in there too long,
we can save him,'' Dunham said. ``We got to him quick and we had the
right people with the right training there.''
   Donnini said the boy's body temperature had dropped to 80 by the
time he arrived at the hospital.

<HEAD>Study Of Miami Police Shootings Since 1983 Focuses on Racial Patterns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey of police shootings in Dade County has
shown the percentage of black suspects shot by police is similar to
the percentage of blacks arrested, but both figures are more than
double the percentage of blacks living in the county.
   The Miami Herald reported Sunday that during the past five years,
46 percent of the people shot by police in Dade County have been
black _ although blacks make up only 21 percent of the county's
population.
   But 44 percent of those arrested have been black, nearly
identical to the percentage of those shot.
   The paper gathered information on 158 police shootings, including
65 that were fatal, from the state attorney's office, the Dade
medical examiner's office and the 18 police departments and federal
agencies that had officers involved in shootings since 1983.
   The shooting death of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a
Colombian-born policeman led to three days of civil unrest in Miami
last month. Deaths of blacks at the hands of policemen have caused
two other civil disturbances during the 1980s.
   Officials said the statistics showed no significant evidence of a
pattern of bias among Dade law enforcement officers of any ethnic
background.
   ``We reviewed it about two to three years ago and reached the
same conclusion,'' said Dade State Attorney Janet Reno. ``If there
is any indication of a pattern, we will look at it again.''
   ``We don't contest all shootings,'' said Aleem Fakir, executive
director of People United To Lead the Struggle For Equality, a group
of black church and civic leaders critical of police treatment of
blacks. But Fakir said that seldom do ``whites get shot under cloudy
circumstances.''
   The analysis found no unusual racial pattern among the officers
involved in shooting incidents, either.
   Countywide, 9 percent of the police shootings were done by black
officers, 29 percent were by Latin officers and 49 percent by Anglo
officers. That ratio generally reflects the ethnic makeup of the
county's combined law enforcement departments. The other 13 percent
of cases involved two or more officers of different ethnic
backgrounds.
   ``I think most police shootings are colorblind,'' said Miami
Police Chief Perry Anderson, who is black. ``The shooting is
precipitated by an unlawful violation. It may be related to drugs or
robbery or burglary. You can't say there is prejudice.''

<TEXT>
   George Bush went before Congress last week and
advocated statehood for an unrepresented region of the United States
where residents have no right ``to determine their political power.''
   Some people in the District of Columbia sat on the edge of their
seats, expecting that at long last their stateless city would get
presidential recognition.
   But, no. Bush proposed statehood for Puerto Rico, not Washington,
D.C.
   He asked Congress, in his budget speech last Thursday, to
authorize a statehood referendum in Puerto Rico.
   ``Insulting,'' said Hilda Mason the next day. She is a member of
the city council of the District of Columbia, representing the
Statehood Party.
   But some local statehood advocates took heart from the paragraph
in Bush's speech. They saw a solution to their long dilemma: the
joint admission of both could send Republicans to Congress from
Puerto Rico while the District would be almost certain to elect
Democrats.
   If Bush is pushing for Puerto Rican statehood _ as Gerald Ford
once did _ he must be sure it would turn out to be Republican turf,
they said.
   ``I think it has the makings of a deal,'' said activist Mark
Plotkin, a member of the D.C. Democratic State Committee.
   Just such a deal brought Hawaii and Alaska into the union in
1959, said Walter E. Fauntroy, a local minister who represents
Washingtonians in the House as a non-voting delegate.
   Except something went awry, he said. Hawaii was expected to elect
Republicans to the Senate and Alaska to elect Democrats. It turns
out that Hawaii's two senators are Democrats and Alaska's are
Republican.
   Fauntroy said Washington has been kept out of Congress because of
``the four toos'' _ the District is ``too urban, too progressive,
too Democratic and, for some people, too black.''
   ``I put the racial thing at the bottom,'' says Fauntroy, who is
black.
   ``At the top is that we're too Democratic. And the fact is that a
rural state would not want to see two more urban senators. And
conservatives don't want progressive. What President Bush said
signals to me that there may be hope of bipartisan cooperation.''
   ``Race is a major factor,'' disagreed Plotkin, who is white. ``It
provides an excuse to deny full citizenship to people who are not
white.''
   The District _ with a population larger than those of Vermont,
Alaska and Wyoming _ is overwhelmingly black.
   On the surface, the timing could hardly be less favorable for
Washington to make its case.
   The mayor, Marion Barry, is the subject of two investigations
into his social ties with people undergoing drug investigations. The
city set a record for homicides last year, with 372, surpassing
Detroit's rate. Fauntroy's own hiring practices are being
investigated for possible payroll padding, according to
congressional and FBI sources.
   Moreover, Congress, after granting home rule for the District in
1973, took some of it back last year. To a bill authorizing $3.2
billion to the city to cover the cost of the federal presence, it
attached a rider requiring the city to stop using Medicaid money to
pay for abortions.
   Congress also overrode the city council and said Georgetown
University could deny facilities to homosexual campus groups. And
Congress compelled the city to repeal a law barring insurance
companies from requiring AIDS tests of applicants for life insurance.
   ``If the District had none of these problems, we would still have
the partisan political reality that it is not in the interests of
conservative Republicans to see the District become a state,'' said
Fauntroy.
   Plotkin disagreed: ``The political reality is that the problems
presented by the mayor and Delegate Fauntroy provide a ready-made
excuse to block any action.''
   Meanwhile, there's evidence suggesting Puerto Ricans may not want
to be dealt in. In a plebiscite on the island in 1967, 60 percent of
those who voted favored continued commonwealth status under which
they are U.S. citizens but pay no federal taxes and can't vote in
presidential elections. Statehood was favored by 39 percent and 1
percent voted for independence.
   The District voted for statehood in 1981, adopted the name ``New
Columbia'' for the would-be state and wrote a state constitution
that was so liberal it became an impediment to the goal.
   Its case hasn't budged in Congress since.

   The city Housing Authority has begun proceedings
to evict a welfare recipient from an apartment where two drug raids
turned up cocaine and more than $200,000 in cash, according to a
report today.
   On Jan. 26, federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents and
Housing Authority police raided Ansille Watts' aartment and found
more than $55,000 in cash, the New York Post reported. Officials
said the city was paying Watts' entire $137-a-month rent.
   The raid also netted close to 1,000 vials of crack cocaine that
were thrown out a window when the officers burst in, the Post said.
   Watts, 36, was charged with possession of drugs and guns and
remains in jail awaiting trial.
   Authorities said the apartment continued in use as a crack den
and on Feb. 1 they returned and found close to $150,000 in cash and
a receipt for a $44,000 Mercedes Benz.
   The Housing Authority has classified Watts an ``undesirable
tenant'' and begun eviction proceedings, said Housing Authority
spokeswoman Val Coleman.

   An explosion killed a Palestinian in the
occupied territories today, and Israeli troops critically wounded
two Arab teen-agers during a stone-throwing riot, the army said.
   In Jerusalem, two left-wing members of Parliament said recent
attacks by Israelis on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are
the work of a ``very efficient and well armed'' Jewish settler
militia.
   The army imposed a curfew on Kabatiya village in the West Bank
after an unidentified man accidentally blew himself up in an blast
that hurt two other villagers, a military spokesman said.
   ``A preliminary report indicates they found a suspicious object,
played with it and it exploded,'' said a military statement.
   An Arab reporter in the West Bank said a 4-year-old girl and her
10-year-old brother were seriously hurt while herding sheep near
their Tayasir village home. The children's parents said they heard
an explosion, but do not know its cause.
   It was not immediately clear whether the army and the Arab
reporter described the same incident. Tayasir and Kabatiya are 10
miles apart.
   A military spokesman denied the man was killed inside Kabatiya,
but refused to elaborate.
   At least six other children have been reported wounded in similar
mysterious blasts, which the government is investigating.
   Ehud Barak, deputy chief of staff of the armed forces, has said
some injuries were caused by flares emitted by fighter jets to
deflect heat-seeking missiles. A few flares fall to earth instead of
exploding, he said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip's Rafah refugee camp today, two
14-year-olds were shot in the head by troops. They were in critical
condition in Israeli hospitals, a military spokeswoman said.
   Two Jerusalem legislators from the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement sent a letter to Attorney General Yosef Harish charging
there is a well-organized militia of several hundred settlers armed
with automatic weapons, vehicles and advanced communications sytems.
   Settler leaders denied an organized militia exists.
   The lawmakers' letter was sent Sunday after 40 settlers stormed
into a West Bank Palestinian mayor's office to protest stonings and
firebombings of settlers' cars. The army spirited Mayor Mohammed Abu
Sneineh out of his Qalqilya office and forced the settlers to leave.
   ``We are calling on the attorney general to break up this
militia,'' said Yossi Sarid, who authored the letter with Dedi
Zucker.
   Sarid said bands of settler vigilante groups started forming a
few months ago in response to Palestinian attacks on some of the
70,000 Jewish settlers who uneasily share the occupied lands with
1.7 million Arabs.
   Settlers formed the militia because they have lost faith in the
army's ability to protect them, Sarid said.
   Settler leader Ron Nachman, named in the letter as a key militia
chief, said the paramilitary organization was Sarid's ``fantasy.''
   ``There is a difference between a militia and people getting fed
up and doing something,'' said Nachman, mayor of the West Bank
settlement of Ariel.
   However, he added that if the government does not take harsher
measures to end the 14-month Palestinian uprising, such as deporting
Palestinian leaders, more settler violence is likely.
   The settlers were protesting the death Wednesday of a 37-year-old
Jewish taxi driver from the West Bank settlement of Alfe Menashe.
Police said Albert Jerassi apparently was attacked by Arabs, but
they have not discovered what caused his car to burst into flames as
he drove past Qalqilya.
   Jerassi's death would raise to 16 the number of Israelis who have
died in the Palestinian uprising. At least 380 Palestinians have
been killed in the revolt against Israel's occupation of lands
seized in the 1967 Middle East war.

   Protestant vigilantes said today
they killed a Roman Catholic lawyer in his home, and Irish
nationalists accused a British government minister of making remarks
that endangered lawyers.
   Patrick Finucane was slain Sunday by three men who stormed his
home in north Belfast. His wife Geraldine was wounded in the ankle
by a bullet and was hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
   Finucane had acted for clients involved in the outlawed Irish
Republican Army's campaign against British rule.
   The outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters telephoned a coded message
to the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast today claiming
responsibility for the attack.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said
Finucane was the first attorney killed by extremists in 20 years of
sectarian violence.
   Danny Morrison, vice president of the IRA's legal political arm,
Sinn Fein, said junior Home Office minister Douglas Hogg provided
the ``pretext for the slaying of Mr. Finucane.''
   Hogg told a parliamentary committee discussing an anti-terrorist
bill that certain Northern Ireland lawyers were ``unduly
sympathetic'' to paramilitary organizations. His remarks were raised
in the House of Commons on Jan. 31.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, said he had warned Hogg that his words could compromise the
safety of lawyers in the province.
   ``I warned him at the time that that was a very dangerous
statement. I warned him that as a consequence, some lawyers in the
north of Ireland could become targets for assassins' bullets and,
tragically, those words have proved prophetically true,'' Mallon
said in a radio interview.
   Members of the Northern Ireland Association of Socialist Lawyers
called for Hogg's resignation, accusing him of making lawyers
targets.
   Kevin McNamara, spokesman on Northern Ireland for the Labor
opposition, said: ``I think Mr. Hogg has got to consider very
carefully what he said. This death must be a tragedy for the legal
profession in Northern Ireland as well as for the family of the
deceased.''
   Finucane, 38, was involved in the County Armagh inquest into the
1983 police killings of three unarmed IRA guerrillas. The families
of the guerrillas claimed the men were victims of an alleged police
``shoot to kill'' campaign against Irish nationalists.
   The inquest was abandoned after Finucane, acting for the family
of one of the dead, went to the High Court demanding that three
policemen involved in the shooting be forced to attend and give
evidence at the hearing.
   The coroner had initially directed that the policemen need not
attend but only submit statements.
   Finucane eventually won his case, but on appeal by the
authorities the inquest was adjourned indefinitely.
   Finucane succeeded in having charges dropped against a man in
connection with the killing of two soldiers at an IRA funeral last
year.
   The predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to
push the British out of this Protestant-dominated province and unite
it with the Irish Republic.

   Heavy snow blanketed much of the nation's midsection today as dry
conditions prevailed in the West and along the East Coast.
   Southerly wind spread rain and snow across the Mississippi Valley
and eastern parts of the Great Plains, and the precipitation moved
over the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley early today.
   Overnight in Iowa, Des Moines got 7 inches of snow, with 4 inches
of that falling in two hours, and Ottumwa reported snow at the rate
of 2 inches an hour.
   In southeastern Nebraska, 5 inches of snow fell at Lincoln and 4

   By late morning, 4 inches of snow had fallen at Rockford, Ill.,
with 3 inches at Chicago and about 2 inches in western Lower
Michigan, with up to 6 inches expected in some areas.
   ``It gets snow-covered and slippery and everybody finds the
ditches,'' said dispatcher John MacDonald of the Muskegon County,
Mich., Sheriff's Department.
   A mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain moved across central
Missouri and southern Illinois, and then spread through the Ohio
Valley and into the central and southern Appalachians, icing roads
in southeastern Kentucky and western West Virginia. Snow fell as far
south as the foothills and mountains of northwestern North Carolina.
   Light snow fell today in parts of South Dakota, North Dakota and
Minnesota, while thunderstorms struck northeastern Arkansas and rain
extended across parts of Louisiana, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   One to 2 inches of rain fell in south-central Oklahoma, southeast
of Oklahoma City.
   Dense fog developed over northern Texas and central Oklahoma.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
eastern parts of the southern Plains across the lower and middle
Mississippi Valley, and the Tennessee and Ohio valleys to the lower
Great Lakes; snow from northern Michigan across much of Wisconsin to
northern Illinois, and snow ending in Iowa and Minnesota; light snow
in North Dakota, and from the northern and central Rockies to the
central and southern Plateau; and strong, gusty winds across much of
the northern Plains.
   Predicted highs: teens in Montana; 20s and 30s across the central

Pennsylvania across eastern New York to New England; 60s and 70s
along the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico, across much of
Texas and the Gulf Coast states to the south Atlantic Coast states;
80s in south-central Texas and southern Florida.
   Elsewhere, highs should be in the 40s and 50s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 5 degrees
below zero at Watertown, N.Y., to 71 at McAllen, Texas, and the
naval air stations in Kingsville and Beeville in Texas.

   Moslem students marched in several
cities today to denounce the United States because of a book they
consider blasphemous and to protest the killing of five people in
rioting Sunday.
   Hundreds of police stood guard in Islamabad near the U.S.
Information Center, which nearly 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists
stormed Sunday. Five people were shot to death, 83 people were
injured and at least 65 people were arrested in the three-hour melee.
   The militant demonstrators alleged the center's library contained
the 1988 novel ``The Satanic Verses'' by Salman Rushdie. Moslems say
the book is blasphemous because it suggests the prophet Mohammed was
fallible, and Pakistan and India have banned the novel.
   U.S. diplomats, who say the library does not have Rushdie's book,
ordered the information center and the U.S. Embassy closed at
mid-day today for fear of renewed violence.
   About 300 Moslem theology students and political opposition
leaders chanted ``Rushdie should hang'' during a march today in
Rawalpindi, where most stores were closed in mourning for those
killed Sunday.
   Witnesses said small groups of young men hurled stones at shops
that remained open. There were no reports of injuries.
   There also were demonstrations outside the U.S. consular missions
in Lahore and Karachi. No violence was reported.
   Three Americans and 15 Pakistani employees were in the U.S.
Information Center when it was attacked Sunday by protesters yelling
``God is great!'' Police repeatedly fired at the demonstrators, who
hurled rocks and bricks and burned an American flag.
   ``The staff is traumatized,'' said a U.S. diplomat who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Embassy advised Americans in the capital to exercise
``extreme caution.''
   American diplomats said they were puzzled that the United States
was singled out by the protesters, as the Indian-born Rushdie lives
in Britain, where his book first was published in September.
   ``The embassy wishes to emphasize that the United States
government in no way supports or associates itself with any activity
that is in any sense offensive or insulting to Islam or any other
religion,'' the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, on an official visit to China,
ordered an investigation of the riot.
   ``My heart is bleeding for Pakistanis who fell victims to the
conspiracy of forces which are bent upon weakening the democratic
government on the one hand and on the other hand for those who lost
their lives due to an unwise administrative action,'' she was quoted
as saying by the official Pakistani news agency.
   The official English-language newspaper, the Pakistan Times,
questioned the motive of the protesters.
   ``It is hard to see how (the United States) became the prime
object of mob anger in the present case when both the author and the
first publication of the book belonged elsewhere,'' an editorial
said.
   The novel takes its name from the verses Mohammed removed from
Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were inspired by Satan.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality who fall from an airliner blown up by terrorists en
route from India to London. They are presumed dead but survive, or
are reborn, and take on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and
Satan.
   Rushdie denies his novel attacks the Islamic religion, which he
says has been of central importance to him all his life. He said it
deals with ``migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death,
London and Bombay.''

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for three black men
said today his clients have told him Winnie Mandela was ``involved
in the events'' when they and a friend were abducted from a church
home and beaten by her unofficial bodyguards.
   The statement by prominent anti-apartheid lawyer Geoff Budlender
came one day after a newspaper reported that Mrs. Mandela, the wife
of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, took part
in the alleged beatings.
   One of the four, 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, has been missing
since Jan. 1 and is feared dead.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, has denied the accusations contained in the
Sunday Star, a Johannesburg newspaper that opposes apartheid. She
has implied they were fabricated to hurt her husband.
   Later today, an attorney who had been acting for Mrs. Mandela,
Krish Naidoo, announced that he had resigned as her representative.
He did not give a reason when reached by telephone by The Associated
Press.
   Howevever, The Star quoted him today as saying ``I felt it was
not within the scope of my work to deal with the Mandela crisis.''
   The three men, who are considering legal action, gave Budlender
statements about what happened to them but have not authorized him
to release details, he told the AP.
   The men, aged 20 to 29, were released from Mrs. Mandela's home
after intervention by community leaders.
   Budlender said his clients ``say they were abducted ... and they
were all assaulted on the first night. They say she (Mrs. Mandela)
was involved in the events on the first night. They say Stompie was
removed from them a day or two afterward and they never saw him
again.''
   Mrs. Mandela has denied that she was at her home when the
bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer club, brought the
four there. She has said they were taken from the Methodist Church
house to protect them from sexual abuse, a charge the church said it
has investigated and found false.
   Community leaders in Soweto, a black township outside
Johannesburg, and officials of the Methodist Church have accused the
soccer club of abducting and beating the four last month.
   The Citizen, a Johnannesburg daily, quoted Zindzi Mandela as
saying her mother would hold a news conference after visiting Nelson
Mandela, who is held at a house on a prison farm near Cape Town.
   An aide in Mrs. Mandela's office, who would not give his name,
said she would hold a news conference Wednesday.
   Zindzi Mandela was quoted as saying her mother planned to sue The
Star and The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper that reported
Friday that the body of Stompie Seipei had been found.
   Police have been unable to confirm that report.
   The Star said one of the four escaped from Mrs. Mandela's house
and alerted community leaders meeting at a nearby Methodist church.
   A well-known anti-apartheid physician, Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, went
to the house, saw the beaten males ``and warned that Stompie had
been so badly assaulted that he would not live,'' the newspaper said.
   The next day, Asvat was slain at his Soweto clinic by two young
men pretending to be patients. Police are investigating the killing
to determine if it was linked to the Mandela controversy.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied any wrongdoing and rejected reports of
discord with her husband, the most popular leader among South
Africa's disenfranchised black majority.
   She told CBS News last week that no Mandela United members were
involved in Stompie's disappearance. She was quoted Sunday by City
Press, a black-oriented newspaper, as acknowledging that the four
had been taken to her home but saying she was not present.
   City Press quoted Jerry Richardson, who describes himself as
Mandela United's former coach, as saying he had beaten the men and
boy to make them admit that they had been sexually molested by a
white Methodist minister.
   The president of the Methodist Church, the Rev. Stanley Mogoba,
said the allegations of sexual abuse against the Rev. Paul Verryn
were fabricated.
   The exiled leadership of the African National Congress has urged
Mrs. Mandela to disband Mandela United. She says the team has been
disbanded but that about eight young men continue to live at her
house.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has appointed a senior police
commander to investigate.
   Nelson Mandela, jailed since 1962, is serving a life sentence for
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white minority government.

   Iran on Tuesday will hang 70 people
convicted of drug trafficking, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   The previous record for drug-related executions was 56 people
hanged on Jan. 16.
   Iran instituted harsh drug laws on Jan. 21 mandating death for
anyone found with more than an ounce of heroin or over 11 pounds of
opium or hashish.
   Up to 1 million of Iran's 47 million people are drug addicts.
   The IRNA report, monitored in Nicosia, said 10 convicts will go
to the gallows in Tehran and the others in eight provincial capitals
and 17 smaller towns.
   Iran suspended executions during celebrations Feb. 1-10 of the
10th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   In a related statement, police in Tehran announced today they
have arrested 3,300 drug traffickers since 1987. During the same
period, police said they seized 10.78 tons of opium, 1,540 pounds of
heroin and 2.25 tons of hashish.

<TEXT>
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party has
endorsed a multiparty system for the first time, but says the change
must be gradual and orderly.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee announced its new
position over the weekend after a two-day meeting during which it
also revised its view of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising.
   Allowing more than one political party would provide a ``better
safeguard'' against abuse of power, the Communist Party said Sunday
in a communique released by the state news agecy MTI.
   It also said ``danger exists for the process to become
destabilized and uncontrollable. That is not in the interest of any
force with a sense of responsibility.''
   In a half-hour interview broadcast on radio and television Sunday
evening, party leader Karoly Grosz said alternative parties could
exist ``only on a socialist basis.''
   Parliament is expected to pass a bill by Aug. 1 that would allow
alternative parties, making Hungary the first East bloc country to
have a genuine multiparty system.
   The Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag today published Grosz's
speech at the Central Committee meeting, held Friday and Saturday.
   Grosz criticized the ``extremist wing'' of potential alternative
parties. He said all parties would have to accept Hungary's
membership in the Warsaw Pact military alliance and ``prevent any
deepening'' of the nation's economic problems.
   Grosz also praised what he called ``more composed'' forces and
said ``there is a realistic possibility to establish a lasting
political alliance with these.''
   The Soviets have not taken a public stand on recent Hungarian
reforms. Grosz is to visit Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
March.
   Hungarian Politburo reformer Imre Pozsgay created conflict among
communists two weeks ago with a stunning re-evaluation of the
anti-Soviet revolt of 1956.
   Pozsgay said the revolt was a popular uprising, not a
counterrevolution as his party had called it for 32 years.
   His comments touched off intense public debate and led to the
Central Committee meeting.
   The committee statement and Grosz's remarks on television
indicated there had been a compromise on reassessing the revolt.
   Grosz said that over the years the party ``had forgotten those
popular elements'' that started the uprising against the Stalinist
regime of Matyas Rakosi on Oct. 23, 1956.
   But, he said, by the time the Soviets had crushed the uprising on
Nov. 4, 1956, counterrevolutionary forces were leading the revolt.
   Western diplomats and some Hungarians active in the dozens of
alternative political groups started recently said they believed the
outcome of the Central Committee meeting was a victory for Pozsgay,
who has pushed hard for a multiparty system.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III left a
dispute over short-range nuclear missiles behind in West Germany and
took his NATO tour to Scandinavia today hoping a solution would be
worked out before his return to Bonn.
   Baker met first today in Copenhagen with Danish Foreign Minister
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen on a stop designed to acquaint the new U.S.
secretary of state with Denmark's skittishness over nuclear weapons.
   Baker then flew to Norway, a staunch U.S. ally that considers
itself the cornerstone of NATO's northern defense. In Oslo, Norway's
leaders expressed reservations about the need to update the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization missiles.
   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said modernizing the Western
alliance's battlefield nuclear arms was one of many issues that
required more discussion.
   ``We believe it should be a wide agenda, including both
deterrence and disarmament negotiations,'' Mrs. Brundtland told
reporters, with Baker standing at her side.
   Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg added later,
``Negotiations could lead to a result which does not make
modernization necessary.''
   Stoltenberg, who will visit Washington this month, said Baker did
not press for modernizing the nuclear arsenal, but only was
``thinking aloud on the policy of the new administration.''
   The most critical talks of Baker's eight-day tour of the 15 NATO
allies are being held in Bonn. West German leaders are trying to
delay the modernization of Lance battlefield nuclear missiles, while
the Bush administration wants to upgrade them.
   U.S. officials said a statement was being prepared in Bonn while
Baker was in Scandinavia that Baker, who was returning to West
Germany tonight, would discuss with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined
to say whether a compromise had been reached or the differences
would papered over until the issue is addressed at a NATO summit
meeting in May.
   West German leaders are concerned that upgrading the missiles
could threaten further progress in East-West disarmament talks.
There is strong public opposition to modernization in West Germany
and the country is to hold national elections next year.
   Baker began talks with West German officials on Sunday after
meeting with British officials in London.
   He has said he is not worried about Kohl's statement last week
that the Lance missiles now deployed are adequate until 1995.
   Under a NATO plan, the missiles' 70-mile range would be extended
with new rockets that could hit targets about 320 miles away.
   NATO is expected to make a decision on modernization in three
months.
   On Baker's agenda in Bonn were two other touchy issues: Western
curbs on technology sales to the Soviet Union and the help West
German companies gave to Libya in the construction of an alleged
chemical weapons plant.
   Baker said the British told him they would like to see the curbs
lifted now that Soviet troops are leaving Afghanistan.
   Concerning Libya, Baker said new West German export restrictions
were ``quite promising,'' as were recent pledges by the Bonn
government to prosecute violators.
   Commenting on his meetings Sunday with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain and Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign
secretary, a U.S. source said Baker received support on many NATO
issues. The source declined to elaborate.
   Also, the source said, Howe urged Baker to plunge into the Middle
East situation ``to sustain the moderate course'' the foreign
secretary said the Palestinians had taken.
   The source said Baker made it clear U.S. dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which began in December after a
13-year ban, would be continued.
   Baker's trip began Friday in Canada and took him to Iceland on
Saturday. His last stop is Paris before returning to Washington on
Friday.

   An elderly woman and her daughter were
found stabbed to death with a butcher knife in their home two weeks
after another member of the family was strangled in her home across
town, authorities said today.
   ``We have reason to believe all three slayings were related,''
said Claiborne County Sheriff Frank Davis.
   Davis said officers were questioning a male suspect in the
slayings and that formal charges were expected later in the day. The
man was not related to the victims, he said.
   A relative discovered the bodies of Georgia Mae Thomas, 58, and
her mother, Mary Bell Simmons, 88, about 6 p.m. Sunday in a bedroom
of the home they shared in Port Gibson.
   ``It appeared they were both sexually molested and both had stab
wounds to the chest,'' Davis said. The bodies were found within an
hour after the women were killed, he said.
   The apparent murder weapon, a butcher knife, was found at the
scene, he said. Highway Patrol investigators and officers from
neighboring counties were assisting in the investigation.
   Davis said another member of the family, Bertha Peterson, 47, of
Port Gibson, was strangled in her home two weeks ago and that the
circumstances were similar. He said he wasn't sure what her
relationship to the other two women was.
   This historic town, about 30 miles south of Vicksburg in
southwestern Mississippi, has a population of about 2,500. It has
many pre-Civil War buildings because Union officers called it ``too
pretty to burn'' when their armies swept through the state.

   President Bush opened a campaign for
public support of his new budget today by returning to the state
that propelled him to his White House victory and declared, ``our
plan is a realistic one.''
   ``It is a budget plan that will work, but not with business as
usual,'' Bush said in a speech to the Business and Industry
Association of New Hampshire.
   Meanwhile, Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, prepared
for talks with congressional leaders on the $1.16 trillion plan the
administration unveiled last week.
   Bush mixed words of backing for that plan _ already encountering
Democratic resistance in Congress _ with a sentimental thank you to
the state that almost one year ago gave him his first victory in the
race for the Republican presidential nomination.
   ``It's no coincidence that my very first stop is here in New
Hampshire,'' said Bush, who came here after a weekend of relaxation
at his seacoast retreat in Maine.
   His speech was the first in what aides said would be a series of
talks around the country as the administration presses for agreement
with Congress on spending cuts.
   Bush scored a decisive comeback win in New Hampshire's Feb. 16,
1988, primary election that restored momentum that had been halted
with a defeat in the Iowa caucuses.
   ``The steadfast support I received gave me the chance to pick
myself up off the canvas. And the rest, as they say, is history.''
   ``A year ago about this time I came to New Hampshire under quite
different circumstances. I had just lost in Iowa. I was up at 6:50
a.m., my first morning here, holding my coffee in one hand and
shaking the hands of factory workers with the other.
   ``The columnists had begun to write my political obituary.''
   Bush's speech highlighted the major features of his budget plan,
which calls for restraint in defense spending with a call for
increases in education, aid to the homeless, child care and
environmental cleanup.
   However, Bush's plan has already been criticized by congressional
Democratic leaders for failing to specify what programs would be cut
to pay for new humanitarian initiatives.
   Bush did not mention that criticism in his remarks. In
Washington, Darman was to defend the plan in meetings with leaders
of House and Senate budget committees.
   ``I presented to Congress a realistic plan for dealing with the
federal budget,'' Bush said. He said his plan would ``keep faith
with our promise to the American people of no new taxes.''
   ``There are some areas in which we would all like to spend more,
but we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order and bring the
deficit down.''
   And, as he had done in his maiden speech to Congress last
Thursday night, Bush vowed ``to work day and night'' with Congress
in coming up with a plan that meets budget targets.
   Despite Bush's no-new-taxes pledge, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.,
said after the speech that there might have to be some form of tax
increase next year.
   ``Obviously, no promise is forever,'' Rudman told reporters
aboard Air Force One on the way back to Washington. He predicted ``a
good three months of heavy slugging'' on the budget fight.
   Bush said he wanted to thank New Hampshire's people both for what
they did for him in the past and ``to thank you for what you can do
in the future.''
   The president says his budget proposal will produce a fiscal 1990
deficit of $91.1 billion, below the $100 billion figure required by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, attended services Sunday at the First
Congregational Church outside Kennebunkport, and then the president
met at his nearby home with a group of Soviet scholars.
   ``It was just an intellectual exercise,'' press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said of the afternoon meeting, which included national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of
State-designate Lawrence Eagleburger.
   Similarly, Scowcroft today described the session as ``just a bull
session.''
   He said the president had invited the scholars, mostly from New
England universities, so he could help firm up his own views on
evolving relations with the Soviets. ``It helps him get a better
feel for our own experts' thinking,'' Scowcroft said.
   Bush has said that in the early weeks of his administration, he
wants to re-evaluate U.S.-Soviet relations before embracing any new
East-West diplomatic initiatives.
   Bush last week proposed some changes in the budget that
then-President Reagan submitted to Congress in January. Although the
two versions are more similar than dissimilar, Bush did propose
several initiatives reflecting campaign promises for expanded social
programs.
   Bush said he wants to hold military spending increases to the
rate of inflation, but so far he has not spelled where else he would
make cuts to pay for these new initiatives.
   Bush has said all along that he would oppose tax increases. On
Sunday, Darman said it would be up to congressional Democrats to
suggest tax hikes.
   Appearing on CBS-TV's ``Face The Nation,'' Darman insisted that
more taxes are not needed to reduce the deficit.
   ``What would happen in a negotiation is that we are certainly not
going to bring up taxes,'' he said. ``The president has made his
position extremely clear.
   ``If the other side wants to bring up taxes, we will have to
discuss that on merits. And our position is that the merits don't
require taxes.''
   Darman said that in his talks with Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., and
Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the heads of the Senate and House
budget committees, ``I look forward to learning a bit more about
what they're thinking of as their own possible budget.''

   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart says his
television ministry will end this month unless he receives an influx
of donations to overcome ``pornographers'' who are trying to knock
him off the air.
   ``If for whatever reason this week, you close the door in my face
or you pass me by, ... Feb. 26 will be the final telecast for this
ministry,'' Swaggart said in his taped television program
distributed for broadcast this past weekend.
   ``It's either the pornographers or us. They will have their way
and eliminate Jimmy Swaggart from television. That's what they
wanted to do,'' Swaggart said.
   Swaggart did not give any figures of how much money he needed. A
guard who answered the phone Sunday said he could not contact
Swaggart, and a message left at his office this morning seeking
further comment was not immediately returned.
   In the latest edition of Penthouse magazine, a New Orleans
stripper said she performed sex acts for Swaggart while he watched.
The allegations leveled by Catherine Mary Kampen, strongly denied by
Swaggart, were similar to those of Debra Murphree, a New Orleans
prostitute, that led to Swaggart's ouster last year from the
Assemblies of God.
   In a tearful confession to his congregation last February,
Swaggart said he had sinned, but did not reveal specifics. He was
defrocked by the Assemblies after refusing to stay away from the
pulpit for at least one year.
   Swaggart has not released any hard figures on the ministry's
financial problems. However, in the past year there have been
layoffs at the ministries, cancellation of his weekly television
show by three major cable networks, and an exodus of students from
Jimmy Swaggart Bible College, which many faculty members left to
avoid being defrocked with Swaggart.

   Lovers seeking the sweetest of gifts on St.
Valentine's Day would be wise to pay a visit to Joseph Schmidt, a
chocolatier for a queen and a president who has elevated
candy-making to an art.
   In his shop on a plain city street, pink and white candy tulips
lay on sculptured chocolate bowls, thin and smooth like porcelain,
hand-painted by the master.
   There are white chocolate swans with long slender necks, and
old-fashioned red velvet hearts, as large and plush as cushions,
stuffed with truffles. Chocolate Cupids float with bows drawn and
hot-lip lollipops beckon for a kiss.
   ``My goal is to create a dream for clients, to fulfill their
fantasies,'' said Schmidt, expressing the same childlike joy as the
hero of the movie ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.''
   Like Wonka, everything Schmidt makes is satisfying and delicious.
Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes.
   Some of Schmidt's chocolate flowers and shell-like bowls are part
of a touring show of confection art organized by the American Craft
Museum in New York.
   Joseph Schmidt Confections, a 5-year-old love affair of Schmidt
and partner Audrey Ryan, is no ordinary candy store. Its artistic
and tasty creations have delighted Queen Elizabeth, former President
Reagan and thousands of loyal customers.
   Schmidt, who said he's ``49 going on 30,'' once made a chocolate
replica of the Eiffel Tower for the French ambassador and a giant
panda holding bamboo shoots for a Wildlife Foundation dinner with
Prince Phillip.
   It is not the size of Schmidt's creations, though, that make them
so startling.
   Many of his finest works are small, with the attention to detail
of miniature portraits. The petals on long-stemmed chocolate tulips
are as delicately shaped as real tulips.
   The cost of all this effort? Schmidt works about four hours on
each of his sculptured bowls but sells them for only $20. Big
bonbons laced with liqueurs are $1 apiece.
   ``We give away our product because we enjoy it so much,'' said
Ryan, who works almost as long as Schmidt's 18-hour days.
   The two former pastry chefs and a staff of 90 people at their
chocolate factory and retail shop each week turn 40,000 pounds of
premium raw chocolate from Belgium into treats for the sweet of
tooth.
   All that chocolate adds up to a $1 million a year business, Ryan
said.
   Valentine's Day, Easter and Christmas are their biggest holidays,
but it seems every week is special.
   Even Groundhog Day earlier this month was an excuse for candied
fantasies, with the cute chocolate animals springing up from the
shelves.
   ``We've created more of an art form,'' Ryan said. ``That's Joe's
love. He spends every night by himself creating.''
   The biggest problem with Schmidt's Confections is that the
fragile sculptures don't travel well. For the American Craft Museum
show, which is traveling to museums around the country this year and
next, a museum courier had to hand-carry Schmidt's goodies on the
plane.
   ``There is a sense of magic when you see Joseph Schmidt's work,''
said Anthea Zonars, assistant curator at the American Craft Museum.
``You can go into a chocolate shop and find chocolate roses of all
types. But Joseph Schmidt's are remarkable. I think they're
beautiful, and they make my mouth water.''
   Schmidt's sells truffles and bonbons by mail in this country and
in Europe. ``If you want a sculpture, though,'' Ryan said, ``You
have to come here and carry it very carefully.''

   Two masked gunmen sneaked into a hospital
early Monday and killed a reputed crime figure in his bed, where he
was recovering from an assassination attempt two days earlier,
police said.
   Patients and hospital employees dived for cover under beds when
the gunmen opened fire in the public hospital in Mesagne, a town of
30,000 people near Brindisi in the southern Apulia region, according
to the news agency AGI.
   The victim, Antonio Antonica, 31, had been admitted Saturday
night after two masked gunmen shot him outside his home. He suffered
a hand wound and asked to be hospitalized for his own safety.
   The assassins entered the hospital at dawn, made their way to the
orthopedic ward on the second floor and subdued the doctor on duty,
police said.
   They burst into Antonica's room, which he shared with two other
patients, shot him twice in the neck and escaped in the ensuing
panic, police said.
   Investigators said the killing apparently stemmed from a war
between rival criminal gangs for control of the drug trafficking
trade in the region. They said Antonica had been arrested previously
on charges of criminal association.

Al Green and Wynton Marsalis.
   Evening concerts traditionally have been held on the Riverboat

   Besides the evening concerts, the festival, which runs April 28
to May 7, will present its traditional Heritage Fair of jazz,
gospel, rhythm and blues, Cajun, folk and other types of music, plus
food and crafts.
   Performers at the Fair Grounds will include many of the stars of
the evening concerts, plus Fats Domino, Robert Cray, Ricky Skaggs,
Pete Fountain, Rita Coolidge, John Hiatt, Dr. John, Robert Parker,
Ben E. King, Pete Seeger, Bonnie Raitt, former Gov. Jimmie Davis and

   The priest of St. Michael's Roman
Catholic Church said dissident parishioners occupying his church are
liars and said he won't respond to their demands that Polish
traditions be preserved and a popular Polish priest retained.
   The dissidents, who number about 80 and say they have the support
of 800 of the church's 1,200 parishioners, vowed Sunday to continue
their occupation of the church.
   The Rev. John Bambol, the current parish priest, said the
protesters have falsely accused him of forcing a popular Polish
priest out of the parish.
   ``This is a small group of people, new immigrants,'' Bambol said.
``We are being threatened by them in the news, through telephone
calls and with lies.''
   Bambol said church officials have decided to ignore the
occupation that began Saturday afternoon and continued this morning.
   ``Nothing. We're going to do nothing,'' he said.
   The protest has not disrupted activities in the 89-year-old
church, which was packed with about 500 people during Sunday's noon
Mass. Following the service, about 80 dissidents remained behind to
continue the occupation.
   This morning, about 20 protesters sang hymns, said the rosary and
prayed in Polish in the church. They said they hope to continue the
protest indefinitely, staying at the church in shifts, instead of
ending today as originally planned. They vowed to start a hunger
strike later in the week if necessary to press their demands.
   The dispute centers on the pending transfer of associate pastor,
the Rev. Roman Palaszewski of Poland, and the replacing of the Rev.
Bruno Pysz, who was moved to a Buffalo, N.Y., church in August.
   Halina Chmiel, a spokeswoman for the dissidents, said Palaszewski
was notified nine weeks ago that he was being transferred back to
Poland by the Franciscan order. She said Palaszewski was in the
third year of a five-year assignment to St. Michael's.
   ``We want our priest back in the parish,'' Chmiel said. ``He kept
the culture, the Polish tradition, which is important in this
church. He was a people's priest.''
   She accused Bambol of getting him transferred back to Poland out
of jealousy.
   ``It's a lie,'' Bambol said. ``He got orders to go and you have
to go.''
   Officials of the Bridgeport Diocese didn't respond to messages
seeking comment, left with the diocese's answering service Sunday
and today.
   In addition to the dispute over priests, some critics have said
the protesters are upset that Bambol was attempting to open the
parish to other ethnic groups. The parish is in a largely Hispanic
neighborhood.
   Protester Genevieve Kozlowski said they didn't want to keep other
groups out of the church but did want to keep its Polish heritage.
   ``What we have is Polish church. Why can't it stay a Polish
church? We don't care if Puerto Ricans or blacks come to pray with
us. We welcome them. But we want to keep our Polish customs,
traditions and language,'' she said.

   Actress Angela Lansbury has celebrated the
100th episode of her hit CBS series ``Murder, She Wrote'' with a
party, but there's uncertainty about another season for the show.
   ``I'm so proud of the show and I have so much a sense of
accomplishment of having remained in the top 10,'' she said at
Sunday's party.
   Miss Lansbury, 63, stars as mystery writer Jessica Fletcher in
the show, now in its fifth season. Rumors have surfaced that the
show might jump to ABC, and Miss Lansbury wouldn't confirm whether
she'd be back for a sixth season with CBS.
   However, she said she's eager to continue if contractual hurdles
with CBS are jumped, and added that ``it's awfully hard to walk away
from success and leave an audience that's so dependent on the show.''
   Miss Lansbury is a four-time Tony Award winner for her roles in
the Broadway plays ``Mame,'' ``Dear World,'' ``Gypsy'' and ``Sweeney
Todd.'' She has also appeared in such films as ``National Velvet,''
``The Long, Hot Summer'' and ``The Manchurian Candidate.''

   Former tennis star Bjorn Borg has again
said reports he tried to commit suicide are ridiculous.
   ``I'm fine. I'm well off. I have made money on tennis. There is
really no reason for me to think about suicide,'' the newspaper
Expressen on Monday quoted Borg as saying in an interview at his
parents' home in Monaco.
   The five-time Wimbeldom champion was hospitalized in Italy last
week, and his stomach was pumped. Some Italian news agencies
reported the incident as a suicide attempt.
   Borg, 33, said he felt sick after eating frozen fish and then, in
an attempt to fall asleep despite the nausea, he took ``a few''
sleeping tablets.
   ``If you take 60 sleeping pills you don't walk out of the
hospital a couple of hours later. That's ridiculous,'' Borg was
quoted as saying.
   Borg said he plans to play tennis with President Bush in May.

   James Caan was listed in good
condition after suffering broken ribs and minor facial cuts and
bruises in a motorcycle accident.
   Caan, 49, was not wearing a safety helmet when the accident
occurred Sunday, said police Lt. Barney Melekian. He said there was
no sign Caan was intoxicated.
   The actor was hospitalized at St. Johns Hospital and Medical
Center, said nursing supervisor Corinne Rogers.
   Actor Gary Busey is recovering from serious head injuries
suffered when he crashed his motorcycle two months ago, also while
not wearing a helmet.
   Caan played Sonny Corleone in the Oscar-winning film ``The
Godfather,'' and portrayed dying Chicago Bears football player Brian
Piccolo in the TV movie ``Brian's Song.'' His other credits include
``Rollerball,'' ``Cinderella Liberty,'' ``A Bridge Too Far,''
``Freebie and the Bean'' and ``Rabbit, Run.''

   Actor Todd Bridges is ``a sick kid''
victimized by drug addiction, according to the mother of the star of
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' who is jailed on attempted murder charges.
   ``It's hard to believe it's come to this,'' said Betty Bridges,
adding that family problems and early celebrity status have hurt her
23-year-old son.
   Earlier this month, Bridges was charged with shooting a man in a
house known as a drug hangout. He is being held without bail pending
a hearing Friday and faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted.
   ``I don't know what a drug addict is capable of,'' his mother
said last week. ``But I know that Todd Bridges, my son, is not
capable of shooting someone like that.''
   ``The drugs and the pressure have made Todd a sick kid and he
shouldn't be made out to be some criminal,'' Mrs. Bridges said in an
interview in Sunday's Los Angeles Daily News.
   Actor Conrad Bain, who played Bridge's adoptive father in the TV
situation comedy ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' said Bridges was angry and
erratic toward the end of the series, apparently because of
financial problems and his parents' 1984 divorce.
   ``He was so sensitive,'' Bain said. ``Just the kind of kid you
knew wasn't going to handle all the problems real well.''

   If you remember to call Kevin Nord, you won't
have to remember anything else.
   Nord is a professional noodge. For a fee, he'll make sure you
remember anniversaries, birthdays, hair appointments, or just about
anything else you don't want to forget but don't trust yourself to
remember.
   Send him a card listing the date of an important event, and seven
to 10 days beforehand Nord will send a reminder post card and follow
it up a few days later with a telephone call. Prices are $2 for each
reminder or $1.75 each for 10 or more.
   If no one's home for the call, he'll try again, and again, and
again.
   ``If worse comes to worse, I'll go out and knock on their door if
I have to,'' he said.
   Myrna Blank, a Pittsburgh car wash owner, had Nord call to remind
her about her son's birthday.
   ``It probably would have skipped my mind. I'm so busy right now
and I didn't want to forget it,'' she said. ``I'm going to make a
whole list of birthdays and anniversaries for the whole year, and
from now on he can just call and remind me.''

   A nutrition professor hopes man's best
friends will want to get their paws on a new doggy treat he invented
and that their owners can be persuaded it's better for Fido than ice
cream.
   ``It's really a treat, but it's a healthy treat,'' William J.
Tyznik said of Frosty Paws, a frozen dessert he developed for dogs
that he says tastes something like frozen pancake batter.
   Tyznik, a professor of nutrition in Ohio State University's
animal science department, says he was shocked to learn that some
people give their dogs ice cream.
   Dogs cannot taste ice cream, and besides, it's fattening, he said.
   That's when he set out to develop his product, high in vitamins,
minerals and protein.
   ``It's not ice cream, but your dog will think it is,'' says the
package notes for Frosty Paws, which is to be introduced to the
market April 1.

<TEXT>
   A group of American doctors will travel
to Vietnam to perform about 100 operations in a mission financed by
U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War, the official Vietnam News Agency
said Monday.
   The 40 plastic surgeons, nurses and other medical personnel will
fly to Vietnam from Bangkok this week, said Ross Petzing, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.
   He said the group from ``Operation Smile'' was one of various
charitable groups responding to the U.S. government's recommendation
that Vietnam be given private aid in humanitarian fields.
   ``Operation Smile'' is a non-governmental, non-profit
organization based in Norfolk, Va., Petzing said.
   The United States and Vietnam do not have diplomatic relations,
but Washington has encouraged more humanitarian aid since Vietnam
pledged in 1987 to speed up an accounting of Americans missing from
the Vietnam War.
   The Vietnamese news agency, monitored in Bangkok, said the
specialists were from 23 American states. They will stay in
Vietnam's capital of Hanoi for five days, it said.
   It quoted William Magee, the founder of ``Operation Smile,'' as
saying that his group would in the future also send specialists to
Vietnam's major southern city of Ho Chi Minh and other areas ``to
bring smiles back to those children with mouth defects.''

   An armored personnel carrier skidded off the
road in southeast Lebanon on Monday, killing a Norwegian soldier of
the U.N. peacekeeping force and injuring another, a U.N. spokesman
said.
   The accident occurred near the town of Rashaya in the foothills

security zone in south Lebanon, said spokesman Timur Goksel.
   ``One Norwegian private was killed and another was wounded. Three
other Norwegians in the APC escaped unharmed,'' said Goksel,

   Goksel said both were flown to the Lebanese border town of
Naqoura, which houses the command headquarters of the U.N. Interim

   The accident brought U.N. fatalities to 159 since the
5,844-strong force was deployed in south Lebanon in 1978 to serve as
a buffer between Israel and Palestinian guerrillas. Among those
killed were 16 Norwegians.
   The force is made up of troops from France, Fiji, Finland, Ghana,
Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Sweden.

<HEAD>Agency Asked to Require Cartons Which Won't Put Dioxin in Milk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The environmental group Greenpeace petitioned
the Agriculture Department on Monday to require that milk cartons
used in the nation's school-lunch programs be made of material which
which won't put dioxin in the milk.
   Greenpeace said such cartons should be required for the nearly 5
billion half-pints of milk that five of the department's programs
help pay for every year. Eighty percent of that milk is used in
school lunches.
   No studies of dioxin in U.S. milk have been reported by any
government agency. Greenpeace relied on a Canadian government study
in its petition to the Agriculture Department.
   The group said the department should require cartons of
unbleached paper, returnable glass containers or any other
biodegradable carton that won't put toxic substances in the milk.
   Paper milk cartons currently are made with bleached paper. Paper
bleached with chlorine can contain trace amounts of dioxin, the most
powerful cause of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals, and
related compounds, according to industry and government findings
announced two years ago.
   Dioxin has never been proved to cause human cancer, but in high
doses it can cause a severe form of acne and recent evidence has
linked it to reproductive disorders.
   The Canadian study and Greenpeace calculations said that a
110-pound child drinking a single half-pint from a bleached paper
carton would ingest 0.6 picograms of the equivalent of the most
toxic dioxin per kilogram of body weight.
   This is 100 times the daily amount that the Environmental
Protection Agency has estimated is likely to raise the risk of
cancer by one in a million if continued for a lifetime. EPA has
proposed a 17-fold reduction in its risk estimates for dioxin, but
has not acted. If the proposed risk estimate were in effect, the 0.6
picograms per kilogram would still represent six times the amount
estimated to raise the risk of cancer by one in a million.
   According to the Canadian study, milk from plastic and glass
containers contained only a tenth as many dioxin compounds typical
of the bleaching process, or none at all.
   All humans in the United States are believed to have trace
amounts of dioxin in their fat. The compound binds to fatty tissue.
   Janet Hieber of Greenpeace told a news conference the affinity of
dioxin for fat helps account for finding it in milk. ``If the carton
were filled with water instead of milk, chances are the dioxin would
have stayed in the carton,'' she said.
   Although no studies of dioxin in U.S. milk have been reported by
any government agency, a Washington television station, WJLA,
conducted its own tests and found levels similar to those found in
Canada, according to Roberta Baskin, a reporter for WJLA at the news
conference.
   The Agriculture Department did not immediately return a telephone
call.
   Carol Raulston, vice president for government affairs of the
American Paper Institute, the industry's major trade association,
said ``there were questions about the testing procedure in Canada,
and neither their government nor ours is relying on those results.''
   The Food and Drug Administration and the industry have begun milk
tests using a more sophisticated procedure and results are expected
in a few months, she said, and the Agriculture Department should
wait for those results.
   ``The industry is committed to providing safe packaging and if
there's anything they're uncomfortable with (at FDA), we'll have to
address that,'' she said.

   March 1 will be a late night for this town.
   Its residents _ all 16 of them _ will appear that evening as
guests on the NBC-TV show ``Late Night With David Letterman.''
   ``If he's looking for American Gothic, I think he's going to be
disappointed,'' said Daryl McCready. ``We don't exactly have hats
and pitchforks. We know what's going on in the world.''
   None of the residents of this northern Iowa town, which isn't
even on some state maps, has ever been to New York. But most are at
least vaguely familiar with the talk show host famous for his
``Stupid Pet Tricks'' routine and off-beat humor.
   ``His show is on too late for us, although we did all get
together and watch his seventh anniversary special,'' said
73-year-old Ruth Hansen. ``It was kind of interesting.''
   Loren Nydegger, a senior basketball player who attends high
school at nearby St. Ansgar, said, ``A lot of people are pretty
excited about this.''
   ``They joke about things like when they introduce the team at
games, they'll say, `And now, going to New York and being on the
David Letterman show and also playing guard, Loren Nydegger,''' he
said.
   Jodi Ross, a talent researcher for the show, suggested Bolan
after talent coordinator Madeleine Smithberg came up with the idea
of inviting an entire town to be guests on the program.
   ``The thing is that there's a lot of little towns across the
country and Bolan is just _ from everything I've read about the town
and everything I hear about it _ they're just really a special
little community,'' Ms. Ross said.
   Letterman, known for his sometimes sarcastic behavior with
guests, will make Bolan residents feel special, she said. Raised in
Indiana, he will get along fine with the Iowans.
   ``He's going to be taken with this whole thing. Of course, he's
going to be Dave. He's going to joke around. But these people are to
be celebrated because they're such wonderful folks and because, hey,
the whole town came all the way to New York to be on our show,'' she
said.
   The Bolan residents will fly Feb. 28 to New York. The show will
be taped the afternoon of March 1 and broadcast that night. The
network is paying for round-trip air fare from Des Moines, two
nights in a hotel, meals and spending money.
   ``I just hope someone there will meet us at the airport. Could
you imagine the headlines: `Little town gets lost at airport,'''
joked Linda Nydegger, Loren's mother.
   The Letterman show isn't the first fame for the 103-year-old
Worth County town located about 130 miles north of Des Moines.
   It was host to 7,000 bicycle riders during a 1987 bike race, and
it made national news during its centennial celebration when
spectators walked around the town parade because the town is so
small.
   With all New York has to offer, what will the Iowans do during
their stay?
   Daryl McCready said he wants to visit the Statue of Liberty and
the Empire State Building.
   ``I was so proud when I built my pole barn in 1939, and then they
built the Empire State Building that was designed to sway 15 feet at
the top. I wasn't too proud of my pole barn then.''

<HEAD>Adolescent Beliefs About Alcohol Predict Problem Drinking, Study
Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A questionnaire assessing beliefs about alcohol
can identify young adolescents at risk for later problem drinking,
according to a study that one expert calls an exciting development
in fighting alcohol abuse.
   When tested with 637 junior high school students, the 90-item
questionnaire was an impressively strong predictor of problem
drinking a year later, alcohol experts said.
   Students who believed alcohol could help them think or improve
their physical coordination tended to be at particular risk, said
study co-author Mark Goldman.
   Goldman, a psychology professor at the University of South
Florida in Tampa, reported the study results with co-authors from
the University of Wisconsin Medical School, Wayne State University
in Detroit and Hope College in Holland, Mich.
   The work appears in this month's issue of the Journal of
Consulting and Clinical Psychology.
   ``It's certainly a very exciting development,'' commented G. Alan
Marlatt, director of the Addictive Behaviors Research Center at the
University of Washington in Seattle. He called it the first
demonstration that a measure of psychological dependency can predict
later alcohol use and tendencies toward problem drinking.
   Peter Nathan, director of the Rutgers-affiliated Center of
Alcohol Studies in Piscataway, N.J., said the study represents an
advance in identifying ``what looks like a rather important
difference'' that distinguishes early adolescents at risk of an
alcohol problem.
   The predictions were not perfect, but Nathan called their
accuracy ``pretty impressive.''
   Goldman said that since writing the paper, researchers have found
the questionnaire also indicates a risk of problem drinking within
two years and possibly three.
   The questionnaire measured how strongly students believed that
alcohol could aid them in such ways as helping them relax, be
sexier, think better, enjoy social gatherings more, or perform
better socially or athletically.
   Prior research shows that such ``expectancies'' strongly affect
the way a person behaves after drinking, quite apart from chemical
effects of alcohol, Goldman said.
   The research followed the theory that ``the stronger they believe
that alcohol has those positive effects, the more at risk they are
for problem drinking,'' Goldman said.
   If such beliefs can be undermined early, that might reduce the
attractiveness of alcohol and prevent problem drinking, he said. The
questionnaire may help by pinpointing the key beliefs that put
individual teen-agers at risk, he said.
   For example, a teen who looks to alcohol for relaxation can be
taught other methods, or perhaps stress in his life can be removed,
Goldman said.
   The most predictive part of the questionnaire measured the belief
that alcohol improves social performance. ``It's what you'd expect
an adolescent to find important, which is how you get along in the
social scene,'' Goldman said.
   Another risky belief was that alcohol ``makes you think better
and maybe perform better'' physically, he said. ``Believe it or not,
these kids think you might drive better under the influence of
alcohol. Those are the kids who are really seriously at risk.''
   The study focused on 637 seventh- and eighth-graders who filled
out the questionnaire and a confidential survey on drinking habits.
A year later, they again reported on their drinking.
   In that intervening year, the percentage of students who got
drunk at least twice a year jumped from 10 percent to 25 percent.
While 7 percent said in the first survey that they had consumed 12
beers or more at a single sitting, 20 percent said so a year later.
   Those measures and others such as alcohol-related fights, crimes
and trouble at home or school were used to define problem drinking.
   Analysis showed that the occurence or degree of problem drinking
by the students was significantly related to how they had answered
the questionnaire a year earlier. The relationship also appeared for
the 550 students who had not reported any sign of problem drinking
at the beginning of the year.

   The Senate's ``old-boy club,'' which for
generations has cheered on former senators if they advanced into the
upper reaches of the executive branch, has come unglued under the
weight of former Sen. John Tower's nomination to be secretary of
defense.
   Tower's Senate confirmation is in serious jeopardy, the nominee
battered by unproven accusations of heavy drinking, womanizing and
lack of objectivity when it comes to defense contractors.
   Many had expected that Tower's nomination to be the nation's
defense chief would enjoy an effortless slide down a carefully
greased chute.
   Tower, after all, had been one of the powers of the Senate where
he served for two dozen years and presided as chairman of the Armed
Services Committee _ the same panel now being asked to confirm him.
   If he expected special treatment, he didn't get it.
   Instead, his nomination became snared in a web of allegations and
FBI investigations.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the current Armed Services chairman, had
made clear months before last fall's election that he intended to
subject new nominees for top Pentagon positions to intense scrutiny
in an effort to improve the quality of key officials.
   ``I said several times that it wasn't going to be an old-boy
hearing, that we were going to have a thorough review.'' Nunn says.
``The presumption that it was going to be something less was wrong
from the beginning. Period.''
   Nunn calls the Tower screening ``the most exhaustive process and
investigation anyone's gone through in my memory in the Senate.''
   ``I think everybody thought that the old-boy network would work
as it always has and John Tower would go sailing through, but it
hasn't worked that way,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., the Armed
Services Committee's second-ranking Democrat.
   Many members, including Nunn, speak of the process of sifting and
judging the merits of allegations against Tower in terms of personal
pain.
   The pain is evidently more intense against the backdrop of a
courtly, clubby institution in which members routinely refer to
colleagues as ``distinguished'' and ``honorable'' and hasten to
smooth over the wounds of legislative combat with flowery
compliments.
   ``This is a painful process,'' Nunn says. ``It's painful for the
nominee, painful for the president, painful for the committee and
painful for me. It's frustrating. It's not enjoyable.''
   In part, Tower's troubles may stem from the fact that he
apparently entered the confirmation process with a relatively low
reservoir of good will among his former colleagues.
   Many senators say privately that they were not fond of what they
say was Tower's testy temper and autocratic operating style.
   Few are willing to say that in public _ but some are.
   ``Tower is a former member of the Senate. But it is probably also
the case that he doesn't have a lot of intimate friends here or any
aura of popularity or good will,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee at the
time Tower headed Armed Services.
   ``He is not necessarily a person who ingratiates himself with
anybody,'' Lugar said.
   Some Republican senators are saying that while they remain
publicly supportive of the Tower nomination, it is more out of a
sense of loyalty to President Bush, rather than out of any sense of
loyalty or affection toward Tower.
   ``They are saying, `we owe it to the president, not Tower,'''
Lugar said.
   ``I don't notice anything clubby in this one at all,'' he said.
   The question inevitably is raised of whether the Tower nomination
is being hammered by old-fashioned partisan politics.
   Some Republican operatives are saying exactly that, accusing the
Democrats who control the Senate of causing difficulties for the new
administration in part to assert their majority status, and in part
as an expression of frustration over their party's defeat in last
year's presidential contest.
   Not so, says Nunn, whose own credentials are hardly those of a
left-wing Pentagon basher. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former
secretary of the Navy and the panel's ranking Republican, backs him
up.
   The two lawmakers say they have worked as 50-50 partners
throughout the hearings and investigations and constantly shared
information.
   ``Sam Nunn has been fair, equitable and _ steadfastly _ he has
been non-political,'' Warner said late last week.
   Warner said he put the question of fairness directly to Tower
himself.
   ``I said, `John, if you were in the position Sam Nunn and I now
find ourselves in ... would you do it any differently?'''
   The answer?
   ``Sen. Tower looked us right in the eye and said, `No,''' Warner
said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met Monday
with the head of the World Jewish Congress and welcomed the opening
of the first Jewish cultural center in the Soviet Union in 50 years,
a member of the congress said.
   Isi Leibler, a vice president of the congress who said he did not
attend the meeting but was briefed on it, said Shevardnadze
``expressed optimism about the opening of the center.''
   The Solomon Mikhoels Cultural Center was opened Sunday in
southeastern Moscow, and more than 70 foreign Jewish leaders,
ambassadors and Soviet officials attended.
   Leibler, who also is the president of the Executive Council of
Australian Jewry, said in an interview he could not divulge details
of Shevardnadze's meeting with World Jewish Congress President Edgar
Bronfman. He listed the topics discussed as Jewish culture,
religion, emigration and refuseniks _ the term for those denied
permission to leave the Soviet Union.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Bronfman discussed with
Shevardnadze a settlement of the rift between the Arabs and Israelis
and that the foreign minister again appealed for convening an
international conference on the Middle East.
   ``In our view, it is time to undertake immediate steps to begin
concrete preparations for the conference,'' Shevardnadze was quoted
as saying.
   In November, Bronfman's organization announced after he met with
Shevardnadze and other Soviet officials that the Kremlin had given
the green light for opening the cultural center. The World Jewish
Congress, which represents Jewish groups in 70 countries, also said
Soviet officials agreed to lift a ban on the teaching of Hebrew.
   Hebrew and Yiddish classes are planned at the Solomon Mikhoels
center. At the opening, Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel said
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev deserved praise for freeing several
jailed Jews and opening the door to freer emigration of Jews. Last
year, 20,000 Jews left the Soviet Union, marking an eight-year high.

   Advocates of statehood for the District of
Columbia _ ``the last colony,'' according to their bumper stickers _
are taking heart from President Bush's endorsement of expanding the
union to embrace another place, the island of Puerto Rico.
   They see a deal in the making: the simultaneous admission to the
union of a Puerto Rico which would likely send Republicans to
Congress (why else would Bush back the idea, they ask) and of the
District of Columbia, which most certainly would elect ``I think it has
the makings of a deal,'' said Washington
stat Democrats.
  ehood activist Mark Plotkin, a member of the D.C. Democratic
State Committee.
   ``I'm hopeful,'' said Walter Fauntroy, a local minister who has
represented the district in Congress as a non-voting delegate for 18
years.
   ``The fundamental objection to admiting the district has been
partisan,'' Fauntroy said. ``The Republicans didn't want to add two
Democrats to the Senate. But I've known all along that Puerto Rico
was viewed as a place where Republicans would get two senators.''
   That would explain why the Republican platform plugged statehood
for Puerto Rico while the Democrats called for statehood for the
district. Bush told a joint session of Congress last week that he
personally favors Puerto Rican statean Evelyn Waugh novel, and if it has
the same feel as the vastly
popular ``Brideshead,'' it's because both were directed by Charles
Sturridge.
   Tony and Brenda Last are a content, slightly bored uppercrust
couple living on a gigantic but out-of-fashion English country
estate in the 1930s. The two are visited by a social-climbing geek,
John Beaver (Rupert Graves of ``A Room With a View''). Brenda
(Kristin Scott Thomas, ``Under the Cherry Moon'') decides to have an
affair with him to amuse herself and shock her friends. Hubby Tony
(James Wilby, ``Maurice'') is too wrapped up in his son and
financial worries to notice the obvious signs of adultery.
   Brenda's affair born of ennui ends in tragedy when Beaver turns
out to be more callow and manipulative than she imagined and she
loses her son, her husband, her wealth and her reputation. Tony and
Beaver suffer as well.
   Sturridge has elicted intelligent performances from the three
leads, as well as cameos by Alec Guinness and Anjelica Huston. The
film's chief flaw is one shared by many Waugh works: the author was
a savage critic of the class system and shows no sympathy for his
characters. So we watch Brenda, Tony and Beaver become more and more
tangled in the web they weave, but we don't feel very sorry for them.

   ``Die Hard'' (CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   It is easy to dismiss this Bruce Willis movie simply because of
its title and because it stars Willis. Don't be too quick, though.
   ``Die Hard'' turns out to be a sleeper of a thriller with perky
dialogue and a believable Willis, if you can get past his Rambo-like
dirty undershirt and AK-47.
   Just about all of the movie takes place in a newly built Los
Angeles skyscraper where John McClane, a New York police officer,
has gone to visit his estranged wife, Holly, a top executive for a
Japanese corporation.
   The company office party is in full swing when a pack of
terrorists arrives, killing the security people, taking over the
computer so they can run elevators and control communications and
keeping the party hostage.
   John is in the john at the time and escapes also becoming a
hostage. He finally manages to weave his way to another floor and
the game, dear viewer, is afoot. And what a game it is. John plays
cute little terrorist games with the leader, Hans (Alan Rickman) and
his psychotic sidekick played by Alexander Godunov. There are lots
of explosives and high-tech weaponry and plenty of cliffhangers.
There's also a nice little plot twist, but that would be telling.
   John McTiernan's direction is tight with the right comedic
breaks. The casting was not in the Hollywood tradition; it was
creative and forward thinking, co-starring Clarence Gilyard Jr. as a
Los Angeles cop who befriends McClane and who happens to be black.
Mercifully, the filmmakers had the intelligence to leave race out of
it and presented Gilyard as just another human being.
   ``Die Hard'' is a worthy nugget for the home screen.

<HEAD>Thousands of Farmers Protest Gov't Agricultural Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of militant farmers burned
cars and hulred firebombs at riot police in Seoul on Monday,
protesting what they called the government's disastrous agricultural
policy.
   Police fired tear gas to end the two-hour protest by an estimated
15,000 farmers who gathered in front of the National Assembly, which
opened a special 20-day session Monday.
   The South Korean news agency, Yonhap, said at least 15 farmers
and seven riot police were injured. Six cars were set ablaze and two
others were smashed with sticks, it said.
   Police said 25 protesters were arrested.
   Fighting erupted when thousands of farmers tried to march into
the Assembly compound after a rally, during which they accused the
government of pushing an ``impoverished'' agricultural policy.
   ``Dismiss officials who have ruined farming!'' protesters
shouted, waving anti-government placards.
   They also denounced the United States, accusing it of trying to
force open South Korea's agricultral market. One placard read: ``The
United States, stop pressure for agricultural import
liberalization.''
   The farmers demanded the government abolish the ``irrigation
tax'' and purchase excess red peppers produced this year. They said
the government encouraged red pepper plantings, causing an
oversupply.
   About 4,000 riot police blocked the march. The protesters hurled
firebombs and hit police with wooden and bamboo sticks.
   Police responded with volleys of tear gas. The protesters broke
pavement blocks into fist-size rocks and threw them at police.
   Dozens of protesters ran into a dense fog of tear gas and punched
and kicked police. Some protesters tossed firebombs that parked cars
ablaze.
   The protesters also burned several makeshift buildings on a
nearby plaza, including one where a machinery exhibition was held.
They also burned dozens of trees.
   The farmers withdrew in two hours, and they returned home aboard
buses they chartered to travel to Seoul for the protest.

<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
opened a much-postponed Central American summit today, saying the
five leaders are optimistic about bringing peace and progress to the
turbulent region.
   Flanked by Presidents Jose Azcona of Honduras, Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala, Duarte made the brief statement opening the meeting at
Tesoro Beach, a seaside resort 40 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   ``I am sure that we, with optimism, will analyze the efforts
we've made according to the Esquipulas II plan and search for
favorable solutions that will promote peace and progress in Central
America,'' Duarte said.
   Then the presidents went into closed session.
   The stalled peace plan was named for the Guatemalan city where
the five presidents decided to sign the August 1987 agreement.
   Diplomats say Nicaragua's four neighbors plan to press its
government for democratic reforms promised under the peace plan.
   ``The main roadblock in Nicaragua has been removed _ the
Contras,'' said one diplomat referring to the decline of the
Nicaraguan rebels called Contras. ``There are no more obstacles (to
reform) and no more excuses.''
   At the same time, Nicaragua probably has most to gain from the
conference, which it hopes will help destroy the Contras.
   ``Among the most important things that will be dealt with at the
summit is the matter of verification and control of borders,''
Duarte told a news conference last week.
   Ortega said upon his arrival Sunday that he believed the leaders
``are going to ratify'' a new plan to step up border controls to
prevent the Central American neighbors from supporting subversion
against one another.
   Central American foreign ministers met U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York last week and called for
creation of ``an impartial mechanism'' to verify compliance along
borders.
   About 11,000 Contras remain in Honduran camps near Nicaragua's
border, but the Bush administration has made no request for renewed
military aid and senior U.S. officials acknowledge the era of an
anti-Sandinista army as an arm of U.S. policy has passed.
   Nicaragua has scheduled elections for 1990 and has met with
opposition leaders to discuss its recent economic austerity
measures, but the opposition claims Sandinista talk of democratic
reform is window dressing.
   A Costa Rican diplomat said that unless the Sandinistas make
``precise commitments and agree to deadlines for democratization
measures ... we will have to prepare for the peace plan's funeral
and the Nicaraguans will have to accept responsibility for its
demise.''
   Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize for writing the plan, which is
designed to bring peace and promote democracy in the turbulent
region.
   ``We go to the summit full of optimism, despite the obstacles,
because reality demands the search for solutions to the problems we
Central Americans have,'' Arias was quoted as saying by the Costa
Rican newspaper El Diario de la Republica on Sunday.
   A summit in August was to mark the anniversary of the plan's
signing, but the presidents, who last met 13 months ago, could not
agree on an agenda. The meeting has since been scheduled and
postponed five times.
   When the peace plan was signed, stubborn civil wars plagued El
Salvador and Guatemala and the Contras were waging a fierce campaign
against the Sandinistas.
   Duarte's U.S.-backed government and the leftist guerrillas
battling it were unable to negotiate a cease-fire. Guatemala's
leftist rebels have been reduced to isolated zones but remain
active, and Cerezo's government has not sought negotiations.
   The United States cut off military aid to the Contras a year ago,
and the rebels signed a preliminary cease-fire with the Sandinistas
in March. Although some fighting continues, it now is scattered and
sporadic.
   Nicaragua, however, has been strongly criticized for failing to
live up to the plan's requirement to strengthen democratic
institutions and practices.
   Besides that, the plan calls for amnesties for political
prisoners, a halt to outside aid to insurgents, and prohibits
signatories from allowing their territory to be used as bases for
attacks against another's territory.

<HEAD>Rape Battleground Moves To Civil Courts As Defendants Sue Alleged
Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter says
there has been no lack of volunteers since he asked attorneys to
donate their time to defend rape victims sued by the men who
allegedly attacked them.
   ``We have already had two cases in the last several months in
which the suspects have instituted civil suits against the victim,''
he said. ``I can't remember another situation like this involving
rape victims in the 16 years I have been district attorney.''
   Local rape crisis officials say the lawsuits against victims will
deter even more women from reporting sex crimes. Such lawsuits,
which also have been filed elsewhere, usually stem from rape cases
in which the people involved either were dating or were acquainted,
officials say.
   In one of the two Boulder cases, University of Colorado football
player George Massucco filed a slander suit against a CU student
after he was charged with first-degree sexual assault.
   His attorney, Patrick Butler, said his client only kissed the
woman. He said Massucco ``is not going to sit idly by and let this
happen.'' Massucco alleges the woman made ``wrongful, careless and
negligent allegations'' that humiliated him.
   In the other case, a woman filed a lawsuit against her alleged
attacker after prosecutors refused to file criminal charges. The man
filed a countersuit after the woman refused to sign a statement
absolving him of guilt.
   Dan Caplis, an attorney for that 18-year-old man, said his client
didn't want to sue, but felt he had no other way to clear his name.
The man accuses the woman of abuse of process, malicious prosecution
and outrageous conduct.
   ``You have to take these cases individually,'' Caplis said. ``My
client is not guilty. I understand the concern of the rape crisis
personnel, and I share that. I might even volunteer to help on some
of the cases myself. But you have to consider it case by case.''
   Laura Sharpe, a counselor for the Rape Crisis Center in Boulder,
said there is a concern that a legal precedent might be set if one
of the women loses her case. She said the fact that attorneys are
willing to volunteer their time to defend such cases will help
persuade women to come forward.
   ``I think the fact that attorneys are volunteering their time
sends a message that they believe in the victim. There is always the
possibility they could lose the case, but having someone standing by
your side is a powerful statement,'' she said.
   Nancy Biele, president of the National Coalition Against Sexual
Assaults in Minneapolis, said of the trend to lawsuits that many
prosecutors are unwilling to take on date rape cases unless they
have a good chance of winning.
   ``Some are poor cases and need to be turned down, some of them
are so awful it would be unethical to file charges, but others could
be prosecuted and they simply won't take them, because they're not
sure of winning,'' she said.
   Michael Enwall, a former Boulder District Court judge, has
offered his help to defend women but said civil court is not the
place to fight such battles. He said defendants in rape cases who
believe they have been wrongly accused should seek redress in
criminal court, where perjury charges could be filed.
   But he said that because of the different evidence requirements
in civil and criminal courts, the wrongly accused have a better
chance of winning in civil court. In criminal courts, prosecutors
must prove a defendant's guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt _
sometimes difficult to do in rape cases, especially those involving
date rape. In civil courts, the only requirement is a
``preponderance of evidence.''

<HEAD>No Halt To Government Sales of Gas, Despite `Serious' Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said Monday it has no
plans to stop selling tritium to private customers despite what it
calls an approaching shortage of the radioactive gas, which is used
in manufacturing most U.S. nuclear weapons.
   The government has been selling tritium to private corporations
and research groups, both domestic and foreign, for decades. But the
practice has come under review since the nation's only maker of the
gas was shut down last spring.
   The Energy Department, in charge of making all U.S. nuclear
warheads and their components, has cited the risk of a tritium
squeeze in urging Congress to approve construction of two
new-generation tritium-producing reactors to replace the aging and
inefficient Savannah River reactor complex near Aiken, S.C.
   The Savannah River reactors were closed down last spring for
safety-related reasons, and no firm timetable for resuming operation
has been set.
   Phil Keif, a department spokesman, said officials decided to
continue the tritium sales since the amounts involved are ``a small
piece'' of total supplies, and since the government expects at least
one of the three Savannah River reactors to be restarted by year's
end.
   Keif said the government expects to sell about 230 grams of
tritium in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. At the current sales
prices of about $28,000 per gram, this year's sales would be worth
about $6.4 million. The price was more than doubled last Oct. 1.
   The amount of tritium in existing stockpiles, and the
government's annual requirements, are classified. Alan Kuperman,
issues director at the Nuclear Control Institute, a private policy
group, said it is generally believed that the Pentagon uses between
5,000 and 8,000 grams of tritium a year.
   Tritium is used in most nuclear weapons to increase the explosive
power of the warhead. The gas decays relatively quickly and so must
be replenished periodically.
   Tritium is used commercially for a variety of research and
medical purposes and for making self-luminous lights, signs, dials,
watches and gun sights.
   Last year the department, through its Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee, sold 247 grams of tritium to 24 customers,
said Jim Alexander, a spokesman at Oak Ridge. He said 94 grams were
purchased by domestic organizations, and 153 grams went to foreign
buyers, including Japan Atomic Research Institute.
   ``Oak Ridge has received no information from headquarters that we
should stop'' taking commercial orders, Alexander said.
   Keif said the situation was under regular review.
   ``We looked it over, it's an option to stop'' commercial sales,
Keif said. But for the time being sales will continue, he added,
since the squeeze on tritium supplies is not critical.
   ``It's serious, but it's not critical,'' Keif said.
   Earlier this month, Troy E. Wade III, the acting assistant
secretary for defense programs, told a Senate panel the department
hoped to get one of the three Savannah River production reactors
back in operation by the end of the year.
   ``If a reactor is not restarted this year, then the supply of
tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear
stockpile may be affected,'' he said.
   Last fall the Pentagon suggested a serious shortage would develop
by this summer if production were not resumed.
   Some private analysts said the government's willingness to
continue selling tritium could mean supplies are less limited than
the Energy Department has suggested.
   Kuperman said his group believes the United States could maintain
its current stockpile of nuclear weapons for three to six years
without any additional tritium production. The Boston Globe last
month reported that an internal Pentagon study said the halt to
tritium production could continue for another 18 months to two years
without affecting the readiness of the nuclear arsenal.

   Soviet inspectors arrived at Rhine
Main Air Base south of Frankfurt on Monday to witness the
destruction of U.S.-built Pershing 2 nuclear missile launchers.
   The 12 Soviets arrived aboard a TU-154B jetliner and were greeted
by U.S. Air Force Col. John Fer, the head of the European On-Site
Inspection Agency office located at Rhine Main.
   Fer's office is responsible for accommodating and escorting the
Soviet inspectors, who are conducting checks under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed by the superpowers
in December 1987.
   The Soviets were to spend the night at a military hotel on base.
   ``Under the Intermediate Nuclear Missile treaty, the Soviets gave
notice of their plans 72 hours in advance after they were notified
that 19 Pershing 2 missile lauchers were to be destroyed at
Hausen,'' said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Pat Maloney.
   He said plans called for the Soviets to carry out the on-site
inspections on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Hausen, a Frankfurt suburb, is the location of the same U.S. Army
missile maintenance depot where Soviet inspectors watched the
destruction of nine other Pershing 2 missile launchers in October.
   Under the treaty, Soviet and U.S. inspectors have been conducting
reciprocal on-site verification checks on removal and destruction of
medium- and shorter-range nuclear missile systems at sites in
central Europe, the Soviet Union the United States since last summer.
   U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, who has headed the U.S.
On-Site Inspection Agency since it was created in April, has said
the Soviets are trying hard to comply with the treaty.
   Lajoie said the Soviets clearly view verification under the
treaty as a foundation for cooperation for further cuts in the
superpowers' nuclear arsenals.

   Ms. Peterson, 47, an expert on wills and estates, is a partner at
the Washington law firm of Steptoe &amp; Johnson and served between 1982

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
on his first diplomatic tour of West European capitals, is finding
it difficult to compete with the public relations blitz of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a senior U.S. official said Monday.
   Baker also is having his problems with West German leaders and
their reluctance to support the upgrading of NATO's tactical nuclear
missiles, the official said. But after touching base in six of the
15 allied capitals, Baker's biggest problem is Gorbachev and the
inroads he has made in Western European public opinion.
   ``There is just an attraction, an intriguing quality to Gorbachev
that you have to answer somehow,'' said the official, who
participated in most of the meetings Baker has held on his trip.
   ``We have no answer,'' the official told reporters as Baker flew
back to West Germany for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Responding to strong disaramament trends among the German people,
Kohl last week proposed a delay of two or three years in upgrading
the short-range Lance missile deployed in the country.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization faces a decision in a few
months on whether to double the range of the U.S.-built rockets from
70 miles to about 150 miles.
   Kohl told reporters he wants NATO to build into its defense
strategy a disarmament mandate if the allies go ahead with a plan.
   After talking to the chancellor, Baker told reporters he hoped
the issue could be settled at a NATO summit meeting, which is being
planned for late May in Brussels.
   He said Kohl gave assurances that he was not ``backing off'' West
Germany's approval of a NATO declaration last year, saying the
allied defense should mix nuclear and conventional weapons that
``will continue to be kept up to date.''
   Covering 15 capitals in eight days is testing Baker's endurance.
Monday, for instance, was a three-country day with stops in Denmark,
Norway and West Germany. Tuesday will be no easier, with Baker going
to Turkey, Greece and Italy.
   The conversations so far in Canada, Iceland, Britain, West
Germany, Denmark and Norway have been ``warm, personal and
professional,'' said the U.S. official, who requested anonymity.
``It's going very, very well.''
   And yet, the U.S. official acknowledged, Baker is having a
difficult time competing with Gorbachev's high-profile diplomacy.
The Soviet leader is withdrawing Soviet troops from Afghanistan and
offered to remove six tank divisions and 50,000 men from Eastern
Europe.
   Baker pointed out to the Western ministers that at home, however,
Gorbachev is faced with a failing economy and that ``the jury is
still out on whether he will be successful'' in trying to revive it,
the U.S. official said.
   The challenge Baker and the allies face ``is not a question of an
initiative,'' the official said. ``People feel very comfortable that
we have the initiative on substance. But it is undeniable that as
you go around people can see that when it comes to capturing public
attention the Western agenda has a hard time competing with
Gorbachev's own ability to attract attention.''

<HEAD>Famous Cave Victim's Body To Be Reinterred At Mammoth Cave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HORSE CAVE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of cave explorer William Floyd
Collins, whose 1925 entrapment and death in a cave became national
news, will be laid to rest again spring, perhaps for the last time.
   After his death in Sand Cave, Collins' body was recovered and
buried, exhumed for public display, stolen and dumped along the
banks of the Green River, and put back on display.
   ``The time has come to let him rest in peace,'' said Donnie
Collins, a Horse Cave resident and Collins' great-nephew. ``He
deserves it after all these years.''
   Collins' relatives and the National Park Service have worked out
arrangements to re-inter the body.
   ``He'll be buried in a cemetery on the (Mammoth Cave) National
Park grounds in late March,'' Donnie Collins said. ``We're not sure
exactly when it will be, but there's no rush after all this time.
He's still dead.''
   The park now includes caves that Collins discovered and died in.
   Collins was 37 when he entered Sand Cave on Jan. 30, 1925, in
hopes of finding a new entrance to Crystal Cave, the cavern he
discovered under his father's Edmonson County farm on Jan. 18, 1917.
   Caves in the area were privately operated then, and competition
for tourists' dollars was intense.
   Collins was on his way out of Sand Cave _ head-first and on his
back _ when he was trapped in a small passageway by rocks that fell
onto his foot and ankle.
   More than 30 news agencies sent reporters to the site, and
thousands of spectators watched while rescuers tried in vain to dig
a shaft parallel to the cave to reach Collins.
   Collins was pronounced dead Feb. 16 _ 18 days after entering the
cave.
   His body was removed from the cave without fanfare and was buried
near an entrance to Crystal Cave.
   Later, the body was disinterred, placed in a different casket and
displayed in a large cavern in Crystal Cave.
   It was stolen four years later. The body was found at the edge of
the Green River, but one of Collins' legs _ the one which had been
trapped by the rocks _ had been sawed off.
   Eventually, the body was redressed and returned to Crystal Cave,
where it remains today in a black casket chained securely to a
concrete base.
   That cave has been closed since 1961, when it was bought by the
Park Service. Until then, Collins' casket was the highlight of tours
and, until 1948, visitors could view the body through a window in
the casket lid.
   ``I'm tickled to death they're finally going to bury him for
good,'' said Pat Thomas, a Bowling Green police polygraph examiner.
During his college days, he worked for O.O. Burgess, the funeral
home director who embalmed Collins.
   After Burgess died, his daughter gave Thomas a set of slides
Burgess had bought that photographically detailed the events
surrounding Collins' death.
   ``That's part of the commercialism of the whole deal,'' Thomas
said. ``I wouldn't trade those slides for anything, but it shows you
the way Floyd was exploited after his death.''

11-year-old Darlene, portrayed by Sara Gilbert, gets her period. The
episode, written by Grace McKeaney and directed by John Pasquin,
handles the subject gently, while still being funny.
   Co-executive producer Tom Werner said Monday he is unaware of any
sitcom that has dealt with a girl's puberty in such a way before.
   ``I think it's a terrific area to be doing,'' he said.
``Obviously, we're doing a family show, and we're trying to do
something that is not only entertaining but is informative.
   ``And I think it's an important story because I think it's
important for young women to know what menstruation is about before
it begins so that perhaps they won't be as frightened and confused
by it, as certainly can happen,'' he said.
   Werner and his partner, Marcy Carsey, also are executive
producers of NBC's top-rated ``The Cosby Show.'' ``Roseanne,'' the
biggest new hit of the season and ABC's top-rated show, recently
underwent a change in producers. Co-creator Matt Williams left,
citing creative differences with Barr.
   Werner said the Tuesday episode was written after Williams left,
but doesn't necessarily reflect a change in the direction of the
sitcom.
   ``I think we're always trying to make good episodes, and I think
it's a chance to do a problem from a mother's point of view that is
interesting and different,'' he said.
   The episode begins with the family gathering around the TV set to
watch scary movies. Roseanne is not particularly thrilled, since the
kids tend to be up half the night with nightmares. Sure enough,
Darlene can't sleep, but she insists it isn't because of a dream.
   By the next morning, the irrepressible tomboy is moping around.
``Are you worried about your basketball game?'' her parents ask.
   ``No, I'm not worried about the basketball game.''
   ``Did you screw up in history again?''
   ``No, I didn't screw up in history again. I got my period, OK?''
   Darlene stomps out, leaving Roseanne and her husband, Dan (John
Goodman), to gape at each other.
   Later that day, Roseanne and her sister, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf),
recall their mother's less-than-helpful advice to ``feel free to ask
the school nurse'' if they had any questions about the change of
life.
   In what Werner describes aptly as ``a lovely scene,'' Darlene
runs into Dan in the garage. He feels compelled to say something on
this momentous occasion, but all he can come up with is a punch in
the arm and an awkward, ``Good goin'!''
   When Darlene starts throwing out her beloved sports
paraphernalia, Roseanne gets the chance to dispense some motherly
wisdom.
   ``I thought there was a lovely scene from Dan's point of view in
the show,'' Werner said. ``I thought that the way Roseanne
Conner-slash-Roseanne Barr handled it was terrific because I think
she tried to discuss the problem with her, which I think is
important, and she actually made her daughter feel like this was the
beginning of a new and exciting phase in her life and welcome to
being a woman.''
   Werner said the episode was probably originally the idea of
writer McKeaney, though it would have been developed by the writers
with Barr and was a subject almost everyone on the show could relate
to in some way.
   ``I'm going through it as a father,'' Werner said. ``Roseanne
obviously has gone through it as a mother. Jeff Harris, who is the
head writer, has gone through it as a father. I think we're excited
about it because I think it was handled in a well-crafted way, and I
think it made its point without being too heavy-handed.''

   Moslem fundamentalists around the
world demand that Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' be
banned as blasphemy against Islam, and this weekend the campaign
turned violent.
   At least five people were killed and more than 80 injured Sunday
when police fired on a mob trying to storm the U.S. Information
Center in Islamabad. The protesters demanded the book be banned in
the United States.
   Fundamentalists say the book does not recognize Islam as the one
true religion and ridicules the most precious Moslem beliefs.
Pakistan and other Moslem nations banned the book after its
publication last year.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in India to Moslem parents and educated in
Britain, where he lives. His other books include ``Midnight's
Children,'' which won Britain's prestigious Booker prize, ``Shame''
and ``The Jaguar Smile.''
   The literary success of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a complex work
that focuses on good and evil, has been confined to a fairly small
intellectual readership in Western nations. In November, the book
won the ``new novel'' category in the annual literary competition
sponsored by the Whitbread brewing giant, but it did not win the
overall Whitbread prize.
   Leaders of the Islamabad march said it was intended to be
peaceful but police reacted improperly.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the protest apparently was inspired by reviews last week in
international news magazines. One official said: ``The reviews had
the first details anyone had about the book. Nobody here has read
the book.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is a rambling fantasy on the birth of
religion, modern history and human relations. It begins with two men
tumbling skyward from a jumbo jet destroyed by a terrorist bomb and
chronicles their adventures.
   A part of the novel fictionalizes certain episodes from the
Koran, the Moslem holy book, and the life of the prophet Mohammed in
what Western book critics say is clearly satire. They have praised
the book for imaginative vision and depth.
   The author says his book is a work of fiction that does not
attack Islam, contains no blasphemy and is not intended to offend
anyone.
   ``It is not a source of satisfaction to me to be banned in the
Moslem world,'' he said in a recent interview with the Herald, a
Pakistani magazine.
   Moslem leaders describe the novel as an attack on Mohammed
intended to insult Moslems and lead them astray.
   Syed Mohammed Younus Kazmi, a Pakistani Moslem leader, said:
``The book has fictitious characters that carricature the holy
prophet and his companions. The book contains insulting and
derogratory remarks.''
   Kazmi and other Islamic theologians say the book must be banned
because it does not treat Mohammed as the prophet of the world's one
true religion. They believe Mohammed and the Koran must be portrayed
only as representing divine truth.
   ``Rushdie has offended millions of Moslems around the world,''
Kazmi said in an interview. ``Such a person cannot be allowed to do
these things.''
   Fundamentalist leaders claimed Sunday's march was not an
anti-American protest, even though many of their followers see the
United States as a corrupt secular culture and enemy of Islam.
Protesters chanted ``American dogs'' and other slogans against the
United States.
   ``It was not an attack on the United States. We just hoped to
create moral support for our cause to stop this unholy book being
printed again,'' Kazmi said.
   Leaflets circulated by fundamentalist groups characterize the
novel as a blasphemous, semi-pornographic attack that says the
prophet was inspired by the devil, his wife was a prostitute and his
companions were evil.
   ``There are insulting remarks in this book,'' said Mohammed
Sadiq, a theology student. ``There are lies in this book. We want
this book banned in America and around the world.''
   According to the author, his novel has been distorted by
fundamentalists who have not read it and oppose any idea that does
not reflect their fanatical literal faith. He said he has received
death threats.
   Rushdie has declared himself fascinated by religion and its
development and role in history.
   He has been quoted as saying religions are ``codes with which
human beings have tried to understand their presence on the planet
and discuss their moral behavior. My point of view is that of a
secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities,
whether Christian, Jewish, Moslem or Hindu.''
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and other government leaders called
the protest at the American center an attack by fundamentalist
parties trying to drive her from office by straining relations with
Pakistan's ally, the United States.
   Rushdie says he has every right to deal with Islam in a creative
fashion, and ``I am not going to run away from the subject because
it is my subject and it is my birthright and nobody can take that
away from me.''

<HEAD>Boy Kills Father After Scolding Over Bad Grades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWOOD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who was scolded by his
parents because of bad grades apparently killed his father to avoid
a whipping, authorities said.
   ``The mother and father had gotten on the child for bad grades
and the father was going to whip him with a belt,'' said Leflore
County Sheriff Ricky Banks.
   Johnny Dewayne Daniels, 17, was charged with murder in the Sunday
afternoon shooting of Mellon Daniels Jr., 44. The teen-ager, a high
school junior, was in custody Monday in lieu of $50,000 bond, Banks
said.
   The elder Daniels was shot twice in the chest and once in the
neck with a .22-caliber rifle at the family's house jsut outside
this Delta city of about 20,000 people, Banks said.
   Banks said the young Daniels reportedly took a .25-caliber
automatic pistol from a drawer after an earlier confrontation with
his father, but his mother, Lula Mae Daniels, made him put it back.
When the father returned home, Mrs. Daniels told her husband about
the gun and father and son argued again.
   Banks said that when the elder Daniels threatened again to whip
his son, the boy went into another room and got the rifle, put six
shells in it and came back and shot his father.
   Banks said Johnny Daniels told authorities he shot his father
because he was not going to let his father beat him.
   The teen-ager is charged as an adult because the crime is a
capital offense, Banks said. A lawyer was appointed for him during a
Monday initial court appearance. The sheriff charges will be
presented to a county grand jury that meets in March.

<TEXT>
   The Red Army said farewell to Kabul in
a ceremony at the frigid airport Monday, then paratroopers in fur
hats and padded uniforms decorated with Afghan medals climbed into a
jet transport and were flown away.
   Some Soviet soldiers remained but officials said they would be
gone by Wednesday, the deadline for the Kremlin to have all its
forces out of a civil war it entered more than nine years ago.
   A U.N. airlift has been suspended because a cargo plane loaded
with food and medicine left Islamabad in neighboring Pakistan
without clearance and another airline pulled out of the program,
U.N. officials said.
   A Swedish airline said it was sending a plane to Islamabad and
would carry the emergency cargo if thre was no risk to the aircraft
or crew, Sweden's national airline TT reported.
   In Islamabad, Afghan guerrillas briefly resumed a Moslem council
Monday that was called originally to choose an interim government,
but two important leaders did not attend and spokesmen said
factional quarrels about power sharing continued.
   The guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in
April 1978, predict the Marxist government in Kabul will fall soon
after the Red Army completes its withdrawal under a U.N.-mediated
agreement.
   Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979 and totaled
an estimated 115,000 when the withdrawal began May 15.
   At an airport ceremony Monday to which 150 foreign journalists
were invited, Lt. Col. Pytor Sardarchuk praised 15 young
paratroopers who stood in front of their Antonov-12 transport plane.
   ``We have helped Afghanistan create order and provided economic
supplies and other goods,'' he said. ``Now you are leaving Afghan
soil and I want to say thank you very much for your service and to
wish you all the best, happiness and health and a safe return home.''
   Capt. Alexander Zhadan said: ``The medals on our chest _ Afghan
medals _ bear witness to what we have accomplished. We would like to
hope that there will be peace in Afghanistan and that the people of
Afghanistan will remember us fondly.''
   At least one departing soldier, a 20-year-old, questioned the
accomplishments.
   ``I think it could have been done peacefully,'' he said in answer
to a question as he boarded the plane, which took off for Tashkent.
He said he thought Soviet intervention ``was all a big mistake.''
   Paratroopers waved through the windows as the plane taxied down
the runway and took off. It climbed in a tight spiral because of the
surrounding mountains and spouted flares to deflect any heat-seeking
missiles guerrillas in the mountains might fire.
   About 450 Soviet soldiers quietly left the besieged capital
Sunday during a snowstorm.
   Sardarchuk would not say how many soldiers remained in Kabul
after Monday's ceremony, which had been billed as the departure of
the last Red Army troopers. They could be seen in armored personnel
carriers posted around the airport's military section and along its
perimeter.
   ``It's a deception of sorts,'' a Soviet diplomat said privately.
He and Sardarchuk said the remaining Soviet troops would be gone by
Wednesday.
   The Soviets completed a food airlift to the capital Sunday, the
same day the U.N. effort was suspended.
   Ethiopian Airlines delivered 32 tons of wheat and dried milk
Friday in what was to be the first of 10 flights, but backed out of
the contract.
   EgyptAir was the original charter airline, but last week refused
to fly to Kabul on safety grounds.
   Romero da Silva, a U.N. spokesman, said an EgyptAir Boeing 707
originally scheduled to begin the airlift last Tuesday ``left in the
middle of the night Wednesday without any clearance and with our
cargo,'' 32 tons of food and medicine.
   ``We don't know exactly where'' the cargo is, he said.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, coordinator of the U.N. aid program
for Afghanistan, told a Sunday news conference Ethiopian Airlines
had refused to continue the airlift. Da Silva said Ethiopian
officials told him the insurance premiums lwere too high.
   U.N. agencies had hoped to deliver another 360 tons of food,
medicine and blankets by Wednesday for the poorest residents of
Kabul, which has been swollen by refugees to twice its normal
population of 1 million.
   ``These people are not the ones who will carry the guns,'' one
source said of the women and children lining up for food. ``These
are people who are hungry and will suffer the most if the situation
deteriorates.''
   U.N. relief centers opened on Monday to distribute food in some
of Kabul's poorest neighborhoods.
   At two relief centers, workers gave packages containing a small
can of powdered milk, a 22-pound bag of flour and a blanket to 800
women and to children under age 5. U.N. officials said the rations
were meant to supplement regular food supplies and should last a
family three weeks.

<HEAD>Grosz Speech Tough on Media, `Extremists' Outside Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz
attacked the state media in a speech published Monday, and he ruled
out cooperation with ``extremists'' outside the party.
   The speech was delivered at a secretive two-day session of the
party's Central Committee that for the first time endorsed the
introduction of a multiparty system in Hungary.
   The body agreed to open talks with representatives of the many
alternative movements that have sprung up recently, but set no firm
timetable for the first multiparty elections or other aspects of the
new system, saying a transition must be gradual.
   Grosz's speech, which opened the session Friday, wasn't published
until Monday, when it appeared in the party daily Nepszabadsag.
   He attacked the unidentified ``extremist wing'' of the
alternative organizations that were legalized last month. A bill due
to be passed by Aug. 1 in parliament is to legalize alternative
political parties.
   Grosz made clear these parties would be expected not to reject
socialism outright, to accept Hungary's membership of the Warsaw
Pact military alliance, and to ``prevent any deepening'' of
Hungary's current crisis.
   There is increasing dissatisfaction over a range of austerity
measures and price increases Grosz and other leaders insist are
essential to boost the economy and help repay the $17 billion
foreign debt.
   Grosz said the party's support is narrowing and the alleged
extremists outside the party try to undermine it further by talking
of divisions between reform communists and Stalinists, preventing
the creation of a viable center.
   He also accused the more outspoken programs on state radio and TV
and particularly the daily Magyar Nemzet, which has published
astonishing articles in recent months, of undermining the system and
spreading lies.
   Grosz seemed to be trying to carve out a middle ground, making
attacks that would please old guard communists but also praising
what he called the ``more composed'' forces in the new alternative
groups.
   ``There is a realistic possibility to establish a lasting
political alliance with these forces,'' Grosz said, without
identifying them.
   A party sociologist interviewed in the trade union daily Nepszava
on Monday singled out the Social Democractic Party, the Hungarian
Democratic Forum, the Smallholders Party and another agrarian-based
group as possible partners for the Communist Party.
   The sociologist, Istvan Stumpf, said he thought the Social
Democrats stood ``a very good chance of regaining credit for the
idea of socialism.''
   His phrasing, Grosz's statements and the Central Committee
communique suggested the communists see a multiparty system as a
vehicle for making socialism popular again, rather than introducing
Western-style democracy.
   Stumpf said no one alternative group had worked out a fully
viable economic and political program and called for the
alternatives to be given full access to data needed to conceive such
policies.
   That would mean opening up government economic and other data to
groups outside the party, which dominates virtually the entire state
and government apparatus.
   Neither Grosz nor Stumpf set any date for introducing a fully
operational multiparty system or any possible coalition. Grosz said
the transition would take a long time and that parliamentary
elections next year would mark only the first stage.
   Representatives from five of the alternative groups met later
Monday and gave a guarded welcome to the Central Committee's
statement.
   Balint Major, of the Alliance of Free Democrats, said the Central
Committee statement ``definitely means some progress'' but contains
``some bombshells'' that suggest the ruling party is still reluctant
to share power.

   Fire investigators on Monday said an improperly
installed fireplace caused a fire which did an estimated $75,000
damage to the home of former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane.
   The fire broke out Sunday afternoon at the townhouse of McFarlane
and his wife, Jonda, in the Georgetown section of the city,
according to District of Columbia Fire Department officials. No one
was injured in the fire, which took 30 minutes to bring under
control.
   McFarlane, who was White House national security adviser under
President Reagan, pleaded guilty last year to four misdemeanor
counts of withholding information from Congress in connection with
the Iran-Contra affair.

   Pressures to attract grants, develop drugs and
publish new findings create an environment that tolerates fraud and
misconduct in medical research, a study said Monday.
   Although the study, by the private Institute of Medicine, said
that instances of outright larboratory fraud remain rare, its
authors recommended that the medical research community overhaul the
ways it polices itself to control such things as fabricated data,
plagarism and carelessness.
   Arthur H. Rubenstein, chairman of medicine at the University of
Chicago, said that in the last decade there has been a sharpened
competition for shrinking research funds and a growing need to
establish reputations through the publication of findings.
   ``All of these create new stresses in which people ... would be
forced to do this (commit research misconduct) more likely than they
would have been 10 years ago,'' he said.
   To protect society from research flaws, he said, the science
community needs to use new ways to encourage ethical research and to
deal with cheaters. Past methods, including peer review and
duplication of test results, are not enough now to prevent careless,
sloppy or fraudulent research, he said.
   Generally, the public has not been affected directly by research
misconduct, but fake research has caused lost time and effort by
other scientists who trusted such findings, the committee said.
   ``A very small percentage of causes of out-and-out fraud have had
a public impact,'' said committee member Paul J. Friedman of the
University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine. ``Luckily,
most cases have not had an impact on how doctors treat patients.''
   He said, however, that one research finding later proven to be
false was printed in 30 scientific journals before it was detected.
After the fraud was discovered, said Friedman, the journals ``didn't
know what to do'' and only now are trying to find a way to deal with
phony published research.
   The Institute of Medicine, chartered by the quasi-governmental
National Academy of Sciences, organized the 17-member committee in
1987 after a series of fraudulent and careless laboratory reports
had come to light. The committee was charged with developing
proposals to strengthen professional standards in the nation's
federal and academic laboratories.
   The report said that few institutions have explicit research
guidelines. This allows the system ``to tolerate substandard
activities by a small number of individual investigators who fail to
observe generally accepted practices,'' the report added.
   At the news conference, Rubenstein said that the amount of fraud
in university, government and industry research cannot be estimated.
   The committee report said that in the last decade there have been
incidents of serious research misconduct at Yale University, Cornell
University, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital
and Boston University.
   These incidents, the study said, ``raised new questions about the
ability of academic institutions to conduct objective investigations
of misconduct by their own faculty members or research staff.''
   A system of peer review and replication of research findings has
been a standard way to guard against science errors, the committee
said. But it said this system has failed because findings often
aren't checked by replication in other laboratories and the peer
review system depends on trust.
   The committee noted that researchers are pressured to build a
list of publications to which they have contributed. Academic
advancement and salary increases can depend on the number of
publications.
   As a result, the committee said, some authors credited with
reports often participated only marginally; the leaders of some
laboratories put their names on all research from their labs, and
the names of prominent researchers were often added to those of the
true authors in an effort to assure publication.
   To correct the problems, the committee made 16 recommendations.
These included:
   _That by 1992 all institutions conducting medical research for
the National Institutes of Health be required to adopt specific
policies to promote ethical research practices and to investigate
misconduct.
   _That the NIH limit the number of publications considered in a
grant application so that evaluations of a researcher's work are
based on quality, not quantity.
   _That academic departments should adopt new authorship policies
not emphasizing quantity.
   _That ``whistleblowers,'' those who report scientific misconduct,
be protected.

   Lawyers for Oliver North said in two court
filings released today that they would be unable to defend him
adequately under a proposed agreement to control the use of
classified material North wants to use in his defense.
   The proposed agreement ``would guarantee a `cuckoo-clock' trial
that would make a mockery of the adversarial process,'' said North's
lawyer, Brendan Sullivan. He said that without the information he
wants to present, ``we cannot adequately defend this case.''
   Part of the proposed agreement would bar North from offering
evidence about Central American countries' support for the Contras
in exchange for favors by the Reagan administration.
   Under the agreement, ``a candid admission'' by the government of
a quid pro quo arrangement would be sufficient, said the court
filing by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   Sullivan said that a quid pro quo admission ``fails to
acknowledge that President Reagan and other top Administration
officials established a policy that the arrangements would not be
disclosed outside the Executive Branch. If imposed by the court,
said Sullivan, that part of the agreement ``would cripple the
defense of this case.''
   The agreement was worked out between Walsh's office, which is
prosecuting North, and the Justice Department, which fears that
North will spill classified material at his trial damaging to
national security.
   The proposed order sought under the agreement would ``gut the
defense'' by barring North from using ``critical information about
the Reagan administration's third-country arrangements for military
support of the (Nicaraguan) Resistance and the official
non-disclosure of those arrangements,'' said one of the filings by
Sullivan.
   In referring to a ``cuckoo-clock'' trial, Sullivan was quoting
the judge in the Iran-Contra case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell. Gesell has made it clear that he doesn't want constant
interruptions at the trial to hear objections about national
security concerns.
   The government's proposed order would have nine categories of
classified information that should not be revealed at trial before
prosecutors have had an opportunity to contest its relevance.
   They include information identifying undercover CIA officers, the
locations of CIA stations, identities of foreign individuals who
work for the CIA and details about CIA operations with foreign
intelligence services.
   Also included would be material about American intelligence
collection on terrorism and efforts to locate hostages; and U.S.
covert activities other than military support for the Contras; and
names of non-Central American countries that supported the Contras.
   Unless Gesell approves the agreement, Walsh and the Justice
Department agree ``it will be impossible ... to protect against
disclosure of classified information that is of vital importance to
the national security and the foreign relations of the United States.
   ``The trial could not go forward in this state of uncertainty,''
Walsh said in a motion that outlined the government's proposed order.
   Referring to the nine areas of material on which the proposal
would impose tight controls, Sullivan said that ``these open-ended,
amorphous categories would guarantee that the trial would be a
constant bench conference, not a real trial.''
   If Gesell rejects the government's proposed order, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, acting on concerns of the U.S. intelligence
community, might file an affidavit with the court objecting to
disclosure of classified material on grounds it would harm national
security.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the judge would
then be required to bar disclosure, which could lead to the
dismissal of some or all charges in the case, depending on the scope
of the affidavit.
   Sullivan suggested that Thornburgh is supporting the proposed
order because he ``apparently does not want to take the political
heat associated with filing an affidavit that could result in
sanctions affecting the triability of the case.''
   Sullivan said that ``it is understandable that if the case is
untriable, the attorney general would rather blame someone other
than the Administration.''
   The court filings by Walsh and Sullivan came hours after Gesell
sent the jury home and scheduled a hearing for Tuesday on the
proposed agreement for additional national security safeguards that
could allow the case to go forward.
   The proposed agreement ends a dispute between Walsh and the
Justice Department which began last Wednesday, when the department
began seeking an order that would impose tight restrictions on
classified material that North wanted to present at trial.
   Gesell rejected the proposal and accepted more moderate controls
offered by Walsh, who said he wanted to proceed with the trial
immediately. On Thursday, the Justice Department went to court to
try to delay the trial.
   The department said it had concluded, and that Walsh concurred,
that ``the trial could not go forward without an additional
protective order.''
   It wasn't known how quickly Gesell, who scheduled a hearing for
Tuesday, would rule on the motion.
   The Justice Department on Sunday was granted an administrative
stay of the trial by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, with the full
Supreme Court to meet Friday to consider the Justice Department's
request to delay the trial.
   Hours later, the department and Walsh announced their proposed
agreement, saying that if Gesell approves it, the department will
ask that Rehnquist's stay be vacated.
   The Justice Department said that without an additional protective
order, ``it will be impossible during the defense's opening
statement and presentation of evidence to protect against the
unnecessary and uncontrolled disclosure of classified information.''
   The department said that ``an enormous number'' of the 300
classified documents North may use at his trial ``are not yet
clearly covered by a protective order of the court.''

<HEAD>Officer Pleads Innocent, Defense Blasts Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The officer whose shooting of a black motorcyclist
touched off three days of racial violence last month formally
pleaded innocent Monday while his attorney said evidence showed it
was a case of self defense.
   William Lozano, 29, is free on bond on two manslaughter counts in
the Jan. 16 shooting death of the motorcycle driver, Clement Lloyd,
23, and in the death of his passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, who
suffered severe head trauma in a crash following the shooting.
   Lozano's attorney, Roy Black, unsuccessfully sought a delay in
the trial Monday because of the racially charged atmosphere in
Miami, and indicated he may seek to have the trial moved to another
city. The trial was set for June 19.
   Lozano, accompanied by his wife, refused to talk when he left the
courthouse, but Black attacked the case.
   The evidence shows Lozano ``shot as the motorcycle was about to
hit him, that he only shot to use justifiable force in
self-defense,'' the attorney said. ``If this had been explained to
people immediately that night, I think there would have been a lot
less disturbances here in Miami.''
   The three nights of rioting that followed the shooting left one
person dead, 11 wounded by gunfire and 13 structures burned down.
   Black produced autopsy reports showing the bullet entered the
front of Lloyd's head, and said the medical examiner found that the
victim had not only been drinking, but had used cocaine shortly
before his death.
   Quoting from a statement by Lozano's partner, Officer Dawn
Campbell, Black sought to show the Colombian-born policeman had no
choice but to shoot when Lloyd raced his machine down the wrong side
of the street.
   ```The motorcycle was traveling at 70 miles an hour right at him.
By the time he looked up it was right in front of him. This guy was
coming directly at him. He started on the line and then he comes
over like that in the southbound lane. If he would have moved, the
guy would have moved too, in my opinion,''' Black read from Ms.
Campbell's statement.
   Many in Miami's Colombian community have rallied in support of
Lozano, and about 25 people picketed outside the courtroom Monday
demanding he be given a fair trial.
   Black questioned how he could investigate the case, saying any
effort to question witnesses in the Overtown neighborhood where the
shooting occurred could begin the disturbances all over again.
   Leaders in the black community disputed that view, however.
   ``I know there are ways they can get the information that they
need to conduct the trial,'' said Raymond Fauntroy, head of the
Miami chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. ``And
we just want a speedy trial to get this behind us so we can go on
and rebuild our community.''

   Text of Peggy Say's letter to her brother,
American hostage Terry Anderson, marking her 48th birthday on
Wednesday:
   Dear Terry,
   My heart feels very close to you on this day. I came to celebrate
my 48th birthday by being close to you and praying for your strength
and freedom. I will go home much older, much sadder and much wise
than when I began this journey four years ago.
   I placed a bracelet with your name on the altar at Maaloula and
prayed there for a healing of our personal wounds, and for the
healing of the wounds between our country and the countries of the
Middle East. I also prayed for peace for the people of Lebanon and
freedom for those who live in bondage as you do.
   Your beautiful children are fine and send their love as so does
our family. Your many friends and thousands of people in America
work and pray every hour, every day for strength and freedom for you
and all the hostages.
   I have sent messages of gratitude to Sheik Fadlallah and
President (Hafez) Assad for their intense and complicated efforts to
free the hostages. Our country and others are working very hard to
bring this situation to a happy ending. I have great hope that
President Bush will work for a new and better relationship between
our people and our brothers in the Middle East.
   Stay strong little brother _ this too will pass.
   I love you,
   Peggy.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain this week will press the International
Civil Aviation Organization for bomb-detection measures to be built
into the design of aircraft, according to Transport Secretary Paul
Channon.
   The meeting Wednesday and Thursday of the 33-nation organization
in Montreal was called by the United States and Britain after the
Dec. 21 air disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland, when a bomb blew
apart a Pan Am Boeing 747. All 259 people aboard and 11 people on
the ground were killed.
   It still has not been established whether the bomb, placed in
luggage, was put aboard at London's Heathrow Airport or in
Frankfurt, West Germany, where the New York-bound flight originated.
   Channon said he also planned to put forward proposals, which he
did not specify, on better screening of baggage, control of access
to airport and detection of explosives.
   He said he backed U.S. resistance to publicizing anonymous
warnings about sabotage attacks against a particular airline. It
emerged after the Lockerbie disaster that the U.S. government had
received a warning of an attack against Pan Am.
   ``If you were to announce every one (warning) you would be
announcing them all the time and people would soon get totally
inured to them,'' said Channon.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization includes Western,
Third World and East bloc countries.
   ``We are faced with an international problem and we must find an
international solution to it,'' Channon said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will
begin a five-nation tour of the Middle East this week aimed at
achieving a ``tangible breakthrough'' in settling the Arab-Israeli
conflict, an official said.
   Vadim Perfiliev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Shevardnadze will visit Syria on Feb. 17-19; Jordan on Feb. 19;
Egypt on Feb. 20-22, Iraq on Feb. 23-25 and Iran on Feb. 25-27.
   Shevardnadze's visit is evidence of an increasing Soviet role in
the Middle East. The last time a Soviet foreign minister visited
Egypt was in 1975, when Andrei A. Gromyko held the post.
   According to Perfiliev, Shevardnadze's trip ``will take place in
the framework of the Soviet Union's consistent efforts to achieve a
comprehensive and just settlement in the Middle East, taking into
account the interests of all people involved.''
   ``We seek to attain a tangible breakthrough in settling this old
conflict,'' he said, without elaborating.
   The Kremlin supports the idea of an international Middle East
peace conference to be attended by the parties to the conflict, plus
the United States, Soviet Union and other permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council.
   Israel has made restoration of Soviet-Israeli relations, severed
by the Soviet Union in 1967, a pre-condition for a Soviet role in
Middle East peace talks.
   Jordan's King Hussein said Sunday he was ``quite optimistic'' an
international conference on Arab-Israeli peace could take place soon.
   In response to a reporter's question, Perfiliev said he did not
know whether Shevardnadze would be meeting during his trip with
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, or with PLO leader Yasser
Arafat.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Monday it is readying a
series of laws in the human rights field, including freedom of the
press and the right to leave the country.
   ``We are trying to implement fully our legislation in accordance
with international standards,'' said Felix Stanevski, the Soviet
chief delegate to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   ``We are well aware that only by guaranteeing human rights and
freedoms can we open up the whole potential of our society,'' he
said in a speech in the 40-nation commission.
   Only by such guarantees, he said, can the Soviet Union ``improve
the standards of living and quality of life of the people, solve the
tasks of the environment and move science and technology forward.''
   He said measures already adopted over a short period of time
``shall improve the situation of the people in the Soviet Union in a
broad range of areas.''
   Among the measures he mentioned were new provisions ``ensuring
the right of the mentally ill'' and the ``opening of new monasteries
and churches.''
   ``Soon there will be another series of laws,'' he said. ``These
have to do with the areas of freedom of conscience, of information
and the press, (of) social organizations, and (of) entry and exit
into and from the country.''
   Reform of the Soviet criminal code also is being prepared, he
said. ``Additional guarantees which will exclude the possibility of
prosecution for political and religious convictions are also under
way.''
   In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Stanevski said
the Soviet Union ``probably'' would join a key human rights protocol
that would allow its citizens to turn invidually to a U.N. body if
they feel wronged.
   It would give the U.N. Human Rights Committee the right to
examine the complaints and take the matter up with the Soviet
government.
   Only about one fourth of the U.N. member nations have ratified
that ``Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights,'' which is a binding instrument under
international law. Most countries, including the United States, are
reluctant to join the protocol, which went into effect in 1976.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the Solidarity trade
union and the government reported sharp differences Monday after a
meeting of a working group devoted to solving Poland's economic
problems.
   At issue was whether a government plan to attack the economic
crisis would be adopted by the working group as the basis for its
deliberations.
   Solidarity considers the plan drafted by the government of Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski a ``good declaration of
intentions,'' but short on specifics, Solidarity spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz said at a news conference.
   The opposition has not offered a reasonable alternative to the
plan, said Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek, speaking at a
separate news conference.
   The working group on the economy, which includes representatives
from the opposition, the government and the official trade union
alliance OPZZ, is part a broad series of negotiations known as the
``round table'' that began Feb. 6.
   Other working groups are meeting on issues of political reforms
and trade union freedoms, and the whole series of negotiations is
expected to last three to five more weeks.
   Solidarity activist Mieczyslaw Gil said Deputy Prime Minister
Irenuesz Sekula displayed a ``really worrying'' tone at the talks
that ``indicates that the government still has a monopoly in
implementing economic reforms.''
   A government spokesman, Zbyslaw Rykowski, characterized the talks
Monday as ``rather difficult'' and ``exchanges of monologues''
rather than a discussion.
   ``The economic debate is so vast that so far it is hard to put
some order into it,'' he said.
   Onyszkiewicz expressed wariness, but said that, ``Our hopes are
not quite blown yet.''
   ``It seem that the authorities would like to obtain our stamp (of
approval) under decisions that have already been made. We have been
and will be careful about it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Final Regulations Issued by FDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday
issued final regulations for non-prescription sleep-aid products
that allow use of most of their active ingredients but bans other
ingredients not proved safe and effective.
   The major sleep-aid products already meet the new standard and
few changes will have to be made in product labeling, FDA officials
said.
   The regulations are not much different from the agency's
tentative recommendations on sleeping-aid ingredients issued in June
1978, said Mike Benson, a reviewing pharmacist with the FDA's
division of over-the-counter drug evaluations.
   The regulations, to be published in Tuesday's Federal Register,
will take effect in one year. They were developed as part of the
FDA's review of all non-prescription drugs, which began in 1972.
   The FDA standard allows use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride and
diphenhydramine citrate, contained in the sleep-aid products Compoz,
Nervine, Nytol, Sleep-eze-3, Sleepinal, Sominex and Sominex-2, the
FDA said.
   The agency also said approval of doxylamine succinate will remain
in effect. That ingredient is in Unisom, Doxysom and Ultra Sleep.
   Not permitted are pyrilamine maleate, potassium bromide, sodium
bromide and scopolamine hydrobromide. Products containing these
ingredients must be reformulated, the FDA said.
   The FDA, in its tentative finding 10 years ago, had recommended
banning these four ingredients unless they could be proved safe and
effective, and as a result many sleeping-aid manufacturers stopped
using them, Benson said.
   Claims on sleeping-aid product labels, substantially the same as
those in the tentative recommendations, may include: helps you fall
asleep if you have difficulty falling asleep; for relief of
occasional sleeplessness; and helps to reduce difficulty falling
asleep.
   Warning labels will have to be changed to add to the list of
medical conditions that if present indicate the product should not
be used. The new labels must warn against taking the product if you
have asthma glaucoma, emphysema, chronic pulmonary disease,
shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing or difficulty in
urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland, unless directed
by a doctor.
   The new labels also strengthen the caution involving alcohol,
advising people to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking the
product. It also advises against taking the product if also taking
sedatives or tranquilizers, without consulting a doctor first.

   President Ibrahim Babangida swore in a new
Armed Forces Ruling Council on Monday, telling its members to
disregard regional or tribal ties and consider their ``constituency
as the Nigerian nation, period.''
   The council, the West African nation's highest ruling body, has
been reduced from 29 to 18 members, with several Cabinet ministers
and the chief of state security dropped. Unlike the former council,
which had two civilian members, the new one has military members
only.
   Babangida's decision last week to disband the council had caught
the nation by surprise, and provoked rumors of discord within the
military and speculation about coup attempts.
   Col. Fred Chijua, chief spokesman for the Nigerian army, denied
in an interview with the African Guardian news magazine that there
had been any attempt against Babangida's government or that any
military personnel had been executed.
   Babangida, an army general, set up the original council after
seizing power in a barracks' coup in 1985. The council is to preside
over the country's return to civil rule in 1992.
   In recent months, there have been growing complaints about the
rising cost of living in Africa's most populous nation, and labor
unions have threatened nationwide strikes to protest
government-ordered cuts in fringe benefits and salaries.
   The military government has imposed an austerity plan to try to
get out of a deep recession partly caused by lower oil prices.
Nigeria's main export earnings come from petroleum exports.

<HEAD>Canadian Businessman Begins Operating Heritage USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian real estate investor began
operating Heritage USA on Monday, but did not reveal his long-range
plans for the Christian retreat abandoned by PTL founder Jim Bakker
nearly two years ago.
   Stephen Mernick, who bought PTL's assets in December for $65
million, will operate Heritage USA jointly with bankruptcy trustee
M.C. ``Red'' Benton until the closing on the sale _ at least 30 days
away.
   Alex Coffin, a spokesman for Mernick in Charlotte, N.C., said
Monday that no ``major'' changes are planned until after Mernick
closes on the property.
   He also said operations at the theme park, including the PTL
television show, went on as usual during Mernick's first day of
operation.
   Mernick will need Benton's approval for actions he takes at the
theme park, ``but that won't be a problem,'' Benton said, indicating
Mernick would pay for any changes he wants to make.
   The new owner plans to visit Heritage USA once a week for the
next couple of weeks, and have up to three of his own employees
working full-time at Heritage USA, Benton said.
   Mernick was expected to be at PTL on Monday, but Coffin was not
sure when he would would arrive.
   Benton said Mernick has given no indication he plans to sell
PTL's assets.
   The PTL ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June
1987. The non-profit ministry arm that includes Heritage Church is
separate from PTL's assets, which include two 500-room hotels, one
unfinished, a water park, a television network and the Heritage USA
property.
   The Rev. Sam Johnson, pastor of the Heritage Church, said the
church submitted a proposal to Mernick about 10 days ago offering to
buy the television network, other facilities and some undeveloped
property.
   Johnson also said relocating the non-profit ministry arm is
``under serious consideration,'' and a move hinges on Mernick's
plans.
   The lure of Heritage USA is the Christian theme, Johnson said,
and relocating Heritage Church would make the retreat less
attractive.
   ``The reason people come is of course the spritual reason. ...
They've come to get their spiritual batteries recharged,'' he said.
   Johnson would not say how much he offered Mernick, but he said
the church is financially healthy, with $5 million in the bank.
   The joint management of Heritage USA is the latest chapter in
changes at PTL's Christian retreat since Bakker resigned in March
1987 amid revelations he had a sexual encounter with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her hush money.
   Mernick's Toronto spokesman, Tom Reid, said Mernick sees PTL as a
place he can turn around. Mernick bought the troubled Firestone
Canada tire plant in Hamilton, Ontario, last year for the same
reason, Reid said.
   ``He looks at what he sees as a general malaise, and he always
looks for the potential,'' Reid said.
   Mernick, 34, has a garbage disposal company, landfill site, waste
water treatment business and travel company, Reid said.

   An off-duty police officer banged a
rifle butt on his floor to make a downstairs neighbor turn down his
loud music, and ended up shooting his upstairs neighbor in the leg,
police said.
   The incident was being investigated by police internal affairs
and the major crimes squad, but so far police consider the shooting
an accident, said police spokesman Vince Dean.
   ``There's no animosity from the people upstairs,'' Dean said.
``They were real understanding _ as understanding as someone could
be.''
   Officer Mark Haskins, 29, told investigators he was awakened by
the music about 6:30 a.m. Saturday and endured it for 45 minutes
before grabbing a Frankfurt .223-caliber assault rifle from under
his bed, police said.
   Haskins, a firearms training assistant, said he thought the gun
was unloaded when he struck the butt on the floor, but the rifle
fired and a bullet went through his ceiling into the apartment
above, Dean said.
   Todd D. Dingman, 29, told police he was sleeping when he heard a
``firecracker-type noise,'' and then realized he had been shot in
the leg. He underwent surgery at Erlanger Medical Center and was
released Sunday.

   Big gifts and guilt sometimes go hand in
hand, warns a psychologist taking aim at Cupids bearing surprisingly
large or expensive Valentine's Day gifts.
   When someone is either falling out of love or already has done
so, and is feeling guilty, ``sometimes they not only give a gift _
they go overboard,'' said Charles Lowe, a professor of psychology at
the University of Connecticut.
   A $2.50 card from someone who customarily sends a more modest
greeting can be a tip-off.
   ``Superficially, gifts are always nice. But gifts can be given
for the wrong reason _ flattery, ingratiation, wanting to get
something from you, or guilt,'' Lowe said.
   So how can one tell if a nice gift on Valentine's Day is a sign
cupid is on the mark or off target?
   ``If this person has not done this in the past, and comes up with
a big gift, that's something that needs to be thought about,'' he
said. ``It could be either a sign of falling in love again or of
feeling guilty.''

   Jilted lovers or angry spouses can turn to an East
Dallas florist to deliver dead Valentine's Day floral arrangements
to their unloved ones complete with a visit from a black-robed Grim
Reaper.
   ``Some people have wanted us to send Venus' flytrap or poison ivy
with the dead flowers _ or just by itself,'' said Susan Roberts,
owner of Balloon-o-grams@Drop Dead Florists. ``But we
don't want to get into trouble for doing that.''
   Dead flowers in a ceramic skull with a plastic snake poking
through an eye cost about $38. For a personal delivery by the Grim
Reaper, its an extra $10.
   Mrs. Roberts incorporated the dead flower service into her store
several months ago.
   ``I was hoping this would be popular, but I didn't realize there
was this much demand for this type of thing.'' She said she plans to
open stores in Fort Worth and Arlington.
   She'll have competition in Arlington from Hate Inc., which offers
three ``hate-o-grams:'' dead flowers, candy boxes full of rocks and
a ribbon-trimmed box containing a dead fish.
   The company made $15,000 in the three weeks leading up to

   The bride will be in white with a maid of
honor at her side, but tradition ends there for a radio newsman and
a nurse getting married on the air for Valentine's Day.
   His friends couldn't take off work, so Bill Bateman and his
bride, Cherie Warren, are cramming their wedding party into a radio
control booth along with disc jockeys broadcasting the KOMA morning
drive show.
   ``These are my friends, it's only natural for me to want to get
married with my friends,'' he said. ``KOMA is funny, it's like a big
family. They couldn't take off work to watch us get married, so
we're getting married here.''
   The wedding party will squeeze into the control room, and other
guests will be scattered around the station listening on monitors.
   ``We found a preacher with radio experience so he can understand
words like `time constraint,''' Bateman said.
   The ceremony has been pared down to about three and a half
minutes, he said. ``It's going to work out like a champ. It's going
to be great.''
   Bateman said his parents in Florida won't miss a word. ``The
music, the build up, the whole bit ... we'll just shoot them the
tapes.''

   Cupids wanting their Valentine's Day messages
to come from Bliss have sent more than 600 envelopes to the
postmaster here for special hand postmarks.
   Good Housekeeping magazine was at least partially responsible for
the red tide when it listed Bliss among a half dozen U.S. post
offices that could provide ``a postmark as loving as the message
inside.''
   ``It surprised me. It made me feel good,'' said Postmaster
Patricia Barber, who subscribes to the magazine.
   She kept right on feeling good when the envelopes started pouring
into the tiny upstate hamlet around mid-January.
   Cupids send their stamped valentine in a separate envelope to the
postmaster and request that it be postmarked and forwarded to its
final destination.
   ``Ninety-one is my record for one day. They came from most every
state, and they went out to most every state,'' she said. ``One went
to Germany, one to Indonesia. Both of those had the right amount of
postage on them.
   ``Many had little notes wishing me a happy Valentine's and hoping
I was doing well. Two or three included an extra Valentine
especially for me.''
   Normally, Barber forwards her mail to Buffalo for machine
canceling, but for each piece of Valentine mail, she used her old
stamp, made sure it was well-inked and gently applied the mark.
   The U.S. Postal Service also put out a list of post offices for
Valentine's Day postmarks that included Loving, Texas; Hart, Mich.;
and Valentine in Arizona, Nebraska and Virginia. Bliss did not make
that list.

<HEAD>Arens: Negotiations Should Be With Jordan, Not PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told a skeptical
group of Jews on Monday that peace talks involving Palestinians
should be held with Jordan, not the PLO.
   An aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, outlined a
peace plan that calls for Palestinians in the occupied lands to halt
the 14-month uprising in exchange for elections and negotiations.
   But the aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, also ruled out talks with the PLO.
   A Palestinian was killed and two others were wounded in the
occupied West Bank when an explosive device detonated after it was
picked up, the army said.
   It said it was checking reports by hospitals and family members
that two Palestinian children were hurt in a blast in a nearby
village.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, troops opened fire on stone-throwing
Palestinians in the Rafah refugee camp. Three Palestinians were
wounded, including two teen-agers struck in the head with
rubber-coated metal bullets.
   In a speech in Jerusalem to the World Sephardi Federation, Arens
argued that Jordan was a predominantly Palestinian state and that
peace negotiations should be held with King Hussein.
   ``If you want to address the Palestinian problem, you have to
talk to Jordan,'' he said.
   Arens said talking with the PLO would only jeopardize peace
efforts. ``We'll simply strenghten extremism, encourage violence,
and show that terrorism pays off,'' he said.
   But the Sephardi Federation, a liberal organization of Jews whose
families came from Arab countries, issued a statement urging Israel
to ``take risks for peace'' that could include negotiations with the
PLO.
   Shamir is said to be developing a proposal to present when he
visits the United States in March or April.
   Ben-Aharon said it would not include talks with the PLO. ``With
the PLO there is nothing to talk about, because we will not agree to
the existence of a second Arab state ... west of the Jordan river,''
he said.
   He called for an end to the uprising. ``Secondly, a formula for
direct negotiations has to exist,'' he said. ``At a certain point,
free elections will have to be held in order to determine the
representation that will decide the fate of our Arab neighbors'' in
the territories.
   He said Jordan should be a partner to the settlement.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began, at least 380 Palestinians
have been killed, most as a result of army gunfire. Fifteen Israelis
also have died.
   In a report released last week, the U.S. State Department
criticized Israel for the way it had responded to the revolt, saying
many deaths could have been avoided.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin made his first public comment on
the report Monday when he told the Israeli parliament the army ``has
behaved and continues to behave gritting its teeth against violence
and provocations like the Israel Defense Force.''
   ``We have nothing to hide because we are not embarrassed over
what we are doing,'' he said.
   An army spokeswoman said a Palestinian man was killed Monday and
two others wounded in a field near the West Bank town of Kabatiya
when ``they found a suspicious object, played with it and it
exploded.''
   The spokeswoman, who could not be identified under army
regulations, identified the dead man as Amin Mohammed Amin of
Kabatiya. She said there was no information on the inured.
   Doctors at nearby Jenin Hospital said they treated two Kabatiya
teen-agers for shrapnel wounds from the blast.
   Soldiers cordoned off the site and investigators were trying to
determine whether the explosive fell from an aircraft or was left
after an army training exercise, an Arab reporter said.
   In Tayasir, about 10 miles southeast of Kabatiya, two children
were reported hurt in an explosion.
   Doctors and family members interviewed at Al-Ittihad Hospital in
Nablus identified the children as Iktimal Abdullah, 4, and her
brother, Naim, 10. Family members said they heard an explosion and
found the children on the ground.
   Iktimal Abdullah later was transferred to Mukassad Hospital in
east Jerusalem, where she was reported in critical condition with
head wounds.
   Israel Radio said it was not known what exploded but quoted
family members as saying there were no Israeli soldiers or civilians
in the area at the time of the blast.

   Kitty Dukakis is doing well and is grateful for all
the encouragement she has received since checking into an alcohol
treatment clinic a week ago, said her father.
   ``She's had a tremendous outpouring of affection and support from
everyone and Kitty is very grateful for it. It means a lot to her,''
Harry Ellis Dickson said after a visit Saturday to Edgehill Newport,
a private treatment center in Rhode Island.
   ``The mail has been tremendous,'' Dickson added. ``Nancy Reagan
and Barbara Bush both wrote warm, encouraging letters, just as many
others people from all walks of life everywhere have.''
   ``Kitty is very optimistic about getting better,'' Dickson told
the Boston Herald on Monday. ``She has a very positive attitude and
she seems very happy.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and the couple's daghters, Andrea, 22,
and Kara, 19, also visited Mrs. Dukakis, the newspaper said.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, checked into the center Feb. 5 for treatment of
bouts of excessive drinking that her husband blamed on exhaustion,
stress and the letdown after his loss in the presidential election.
   Mrs. Dukakis had conquered a 26-year dependency on diet pills in
1982 and had not been known to have an alcohol problem. Dukakis
called her chemical dependency ``a disease from which you never
recover; you're always recovering.''

<HEAD>Anderson's Sister Sends Letter To Lebanese Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peggy Say sent a letter through the media
Friday to her brother Terry Anderson, the hostage held longest in
Lebanon, urging him to be strong and expressing hope President Bush
will try to obtain his freedom.
   ``Stay strong little brother _ this too will pass,'' Mrs. Say
wrote to the journalist, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. ``I have
great hopes that President Bush will work for a new and better
relationship between our people and our brothers in the Middle
East.''
   The letter was sent from Damascus, Syria, where Mrs. Say is
visiting. It was hoped Beirut newspapers would get it to Anderson's
captors by publishing it on her birthday Wednesday.
   ``My heart feels very close to you on this day,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
``I came to celebrate my 48th birthday by being close to you and
praying for your strength and freedom. I will go home much older,
much sadder and much wiser than when I began this journey four years
ago.''
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was abducted in west Beirut and Islamic Jihad, believed to be
made up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran, claimed
responsibility. He and eight other Americans are among 15 foreign
hostages held in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say flew to Damascus on Monday to meet with Syrian officials
who have cooperated with efforts to obtain the release of hostages.
   In her letter, she said she thanked to President Hafez Assad and
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadalallah, spiritual guide of the Lebanese
Shiite group Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella organization for
those holding hostages.
   ``I have sent messages of gratitude to Sheik Fadlallah and
President Assad for their intense and complicated efforts to free
the hostages,'' the letter said. ``Our country and others are
working very hard to bring this situation to a happy ending.''
   Syria is believed to have been instrumental in the release of
French and West German hostages last year, acting as mediator among
Iran, the kidnappers and countries whose nationals were held.
   Assad's government has good relations with Iran and was its only
major Arab ally in the 8-year-war with Iraq suspended by a
cease-fire last August. Syria also has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon
and is its main power broker after nearly 14 years of sectarian
civil war.
   In her leter to Anderson, Mrs. Say mentioned a visit Friday to
one of the world's oldest churches, where she prayed for his
release, better U.S.-Syrian relations and peace in Lebanon.
   She hung a bracelet engraved with his name on a cross on the
altar of the Greek Catholic Church of St. Sergius near Damascus. It
was built about 300 years after Christ's death in Maaloula, whose
villagers still speak his language, Aramaic.
   ``I placed a bracelet with your name on the altar at Maaloula and
prayed there for a healing of our personal wounds, and for the
healing of the wounds between our country and the countries of the
Middle East,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
   ``I also prayed for peace for the people of Lebanon and freedom
for those who live in bondage as you do.''
   His sister assured Anderson his two daughters, teen-age Gabriella
and 3-year-old Sulome, born after his abduction, were in good health.
   ``Your beautiful children are fine and send their love as does
our family,'' she said. ``Your many friends and thousands of people
in America work and pray every hour, every day for strength and
freedom for you and all the hostages.''

<HEAD>Eds: Subs first item to UPDATE with Lansbury signing new pact with
CBS.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angela Lansbury, whose high-rated ``Murder, She
Wrote'' is one of the few bright spots on third-place CBS' schedule,
has agreed to stay with the network for another year, though not
necessarily in the same show.
   CBS announced Monday that negotiations for another season of the
top-10 hour drama are continuing, but that Miss Lansbury has agreed
to star in at least 13 episodes of a new half-hour show on CBS the
season after ``Murder, She Wrote'' ends its run.
   ``Murder, She Wrote,'' in which Miss Lansbury, 63, plays a shrewd
but grandmotherly mystery writer who gets involved in murder cases,
is in its fifth season, after which Miss Lansbury had planned to
quit. Under the new pact, Miss Lansbury's company, Corymore
Productions, operated by her sons David and Anthony Shaw, will
produce the half-hour show and two made-for-TV movies for CBS over
the next three years. Miss Lansbury will star in at least one of the
movies.
   The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Miss Lansbury and
the rest of the ``Murder, She Wrote'' crew had long grumbled about
penny-pinching by the network, which had undertaken a last-ditch
campaign to keep the show for at least another year.
   Miss Lansbury and crew celebrated the show's 100th episode in Los
Angeles on Sunday, the day before the new CBS deal was announced.
   ``I'm so proud of the show and I have so much a sense of
accomplishment of having remained in the top 10,'' Miss Lansbury
said at the bash.
   Miss Lansbury said she was eager to continue with CBS if
contractual hurdles could be cleared, adding, ``it's awfully hard to
walk away from success and leave an audience that's so dependent on
the show.''
   ``Murder, She Wrote'' draws an estimated 40 million viewers a
week and is a linchpin in CBS' successful Sunday night lineup. NBC
is similarly dependent on ``The Cosby Show'' as an anchor for its
top-10 Thursday night lineup and managed to eke another year out of
star Bill Cosby, who, like Miss Lansbury, had planned to quit his
show after this season.
   Miss Lansbury is a four-time Tony Award winner for her roles in
the Broadway plays ``Mame,'' ``Dear World,'' ``Gypsy'' and ``Sweeney
Todd.'' She has also appeared in such films as ``National Velvet,''
``The Long, Hot Summer'' and ``The Manchurian Candidate.''

<HEAD>FTC Says Company Will Donate Money to Medical Associations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Monday that a
Pittsburgh company will donate $600,000 to three medical
associations to settle complaints of false advertising.
   The FTC said General Nutrition Corp. signed a consent decree
under which it pledged not to make false or unsubstantiated claims
about its products.
   Signing the decree is not an admission of any violations.
Violation of its terms can mean a fine of $10,000.
   The commission said the company made false and unsubstantiated
claims that its ``Healthy Greens'' diet supplement was effective in
reducing the risk of cancer.
   Also, the commission said, the company falsely claimed that six
other supplements, mainly sold to body builders, promoted weight
loss, increased muscle growth and slowed aging.
   The consent order was approved by a 3-1 vote. Commissioner Margot
Machol did not participate. The dissenter, Commissioner Mary L.
Azcuenaga, said the order left the company ``free to sell products
it knows are deceptively labeled.''
   The money will be split among the American Heart Association, the
American Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society.
   C. Stephen Baker, a lawyer handling the case in the commission's
Chicago office, said such required donations were rare but had been
used in the past.
   Such a remedy was chosen, he said, because, ``it would be
extraordinarily difficult or impossible to identify the people who
had bought this stuff'' and should get refunds.

<HEAD>Feds Drop Arson Charges In Fire That Killed Two</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All charges against a British tourist accused of
setting a hotel fire that killed two people were dropped Monday
because the principal witness against her, her boyfriend, refused to
testify.
   Tara Jane Terry, 19, of Camberley, England, faced a federal arson
charge in the Sept. 17 blaze in Miami Beach at the Nassau Hotel,
which began in a room she shared with Mark Richardson, 20, of
Sandhurst, in Surrey, England.
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp ordered the indictment
thrown out on the request of prosecutors who complained that
Richardson refused to return from England to testify.
   ``It's not unusual,'' U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said.
``Witnesses frequently become recalcitrant later in the process, but
it's very disappointing when the witness is a key one and they're
overseas.''
   While the federal decision did not rule out state charges against
Ms. Terry, Dade County Assistant State Attorney Joseph Rosenbaum
said his office had no such plans.
   ``If they can't get Richardson back, how are we going to?'' he
said.
   Initial police reports claimed Miss Terry set the blaze, which
killed an 82-year-old man and a 76-year-old woman, after arguing
with Richardson.
   Richardson was detained briefly after the fire as a material
witness but was then freed to go back to England.
   Lehtinen said prosecutors can ask the British government to make
Richardson available for depositions, but added the process was long
and complicated.
   As soon as Ryskamp dismissed the indictment Monday, Miss Terry
sprang from her chair and pointed an accusing finger at her
prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Lindsey.
   ``Next time, make sure you have proof,'' she said angrily.
   The judge discharged her $100,000 bond and returned her passport
and other documents.
   ``All she wants to do is get on a plane to London and get back to
her home in Surrey,'' said her attorney, Richard Sharpstein.
   He attacked the case as unfair from the outset.
   ``This has been an irresponsible and embarrassing prosecution
from day one,'' Sharpstein said. ``However, a possible result is
that it shows that the American justice system works.''
   The government contention that Richardson's refusal to testify
prompted the dismissal was just a ``red herring,'' Sharpstein said.
   Miss Terry was charged under an infrequently used federal arson
statute making it illegal to set fires in establishments doing
interstate business.

<TEXT>
   State television showed the ceremonial departure
from Kabul of some of the last Soviet soldiers Monday and praised
what the soldiers had done, but it did not mention the misgivings
some expressed.
   It said they were the last Red Army soldiers in the Afghan
capital. But others remained after the plane left, and a colonel
said they would be gone by Wednesday, the deadline for Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The evening television news program ``Vremya'' began its
international segment with videotape from Kabul and the border town
of Termez in what has become a nightly ritual as the pullout nears
its end.
   Media reports generally praise the soldiers for ``fulfilling
their internationalist duty'' in Afghanistan and stress the themes
of patriotism and heroism.
   Soviet soldiers were shown at the Kabul airport Monday standing
in front of transport planes and a crowd of foreign reporters. The
troops, the broadcast said, had helped distribute food to the
capital, which has suffered shortages as anti-government guerrillas
enforce a blockade.
   ``It occurs to me that this will not be forgotten by the
thousands of women, old women and children of Kabul,'' the
``Vremya'' correspondent said.
   The correspondent then interviewed Vyacheslav Ryabinin, the last
soldier at the airport to board a Soviet plane for home. He said he
had served one year and four months and was looking forward to
rejoining his relatives in the Soviet Union.
   The soldiers then were shown boarding a transport plane and
flying home.
   ``After a command, the last Soviet soldiers of the Kabul garrison
scaled the ramp,'' the official news agency Tass said in an upbeat
report. ``Ryabinin waved his hand and the metal door of the plane
was closed. The liner took off, heading for the Soviet Union.''
   Neither the Tass nor ``Vremya'' reports mentioned the misgivings
some soldiers have expressed after the nine-year Soviet
intervention. One 20-year-old paratrooper told The Associated Press
at the airport before departing: ``I think it could have been done
peacefully. I think it was a big mistake.'' He did not give his name.
   Wednesday is the deadline in a U.N.-mediated accord for the
Soviet Union to have all its troops out of Afghanistan. The Kremlin
sent more than 100,000 soldiers into the country in December 1979.
Tass said Monday that more than 3,000 soldiers a day were streaming
through the Soviet border towns of Termez and Kushka.
   ``Vremya'' showed armored personnel carriers carrying red flags
crossing into the Soviet Union at Termez. Women carrying red roses
and red carnations stood waiting for their loved ones. The
correspondent said World War II veterans were among those welcoming
the returning soldiers.

   A Mount Pulaski, Ill., company plans to make a
no-calorie, high-fiber flour from corn cobs for use in fiber-rich
bread, cereals, doughnuts and other foods, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   Mount Pulaski Products Inc. will produce the dietary fiber using
a process patented by two USDA scientists, J. Michael Gould and Lee
B. Dexter, at the Northern Regional Research Center, Peoria, Ill.
   In a statement issued here by the department's Agricultural
Research Service, Gould said the process ``softens the fibrous parts
of corn cobs and other cereal crops so they can be ground and used
as a no-calorie, high-fiber product.''
   Gould said tests showed the material can boost the fiber content
of baked goods such as pancake and cake mixes up to 30 percent
without affecting taste.
   The Mount Pulaski firm expects to provide 25 to 30 new jobs for
rural central Illinois, the agency said.

<HEAD>City Affirmative Action Plan Faces Legal Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A requirement that construction firms working for
the city give some of their business to minority subcontractors was
challenged in court Monday, in what may be the first test of a
recent Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action.
   Fairview Construction, which lost a contract to build a police
station due to the requirement, has challenged the constitutionality
of the plan based on the Supreme Court's ruling last month that
struck down a similar ``set aside'' program in Richmond, Va.
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge Albert Tuttle on Monday allowed
lawyers for Fairview to amend their previously filed lawsuit to
include the constitutional question on the minority issue. But city
attorneys said they will try to get the affirmative action issue
dismissed.
   Tuttle set another pre-trial hearing for March 7.
   ``There are very similar things in Boston's program to what the
Supreme Court held unconstitutional in the Richmond decision,'' said
Fairview attorney Edward J. Quinlan before Monday's hearing.
   Attorneys for the city argued that the Fairview contract was
rejected because of a bidding irregularity and did not hinge on the
minority requirements. But the lawsuit's amendment did appear to
open the door to the constitutional question, said Al Wallis, city
assistant corporation counsel.
   ``It seems to be that that issue is in the case. How it gets
resolved in the case remains to be seen,'' Wallis said.
   In Richmond, minority firms were guaranteed 30 percent of city
contracts. In Boston, the requirement is 15 percent, except in areas
determined to have a high percentage of minorities, where the
requirement is 30 percent.
   Justice Sandra Day O`Connor, writing for the majority in the Jan.
23 decision, said construction set-asides can be enacted only with
specific proof that there has been past race discrimination in the
construction industry and if there is no other ``race-neutral''
remedy.
   Tuttle's decision will be confined to Massachusetts, but the case
has national implications as cities wait to see how the Supreme
Court ruling will be interpreted, attorneys said.
   Thirty-six states and nearly 200 local governments have programs
that set quotas, goals or require good faith efforts to enlist
minority participation, said Benna Solomon, an attorney who
represents the National Governors Association, the U.S. Conference
of Mayors and five other organizations.
   The significance of the Massachusetts case is that it comes so
soon after the high court's ruling, Solomon said.
   ``Whenever you have a major ruling like the Supreme Court
decision in the Richmond case it does not answer all of the
questions,'' Solomon said. ``That is why that process of evaluation
of the decision by other courts in the context of reviewing other
plans is so important.''
   Boston officials say they believe their program will hold up.
   The legal challenge stemmed from a dispute dating back to last
fall when Fairview came in with the low bid to building the police
station, but lost the contract after Sciaba Construction Co. of
Boston protested that sections of the Fairview bid did not meet the
city's minority business rules.
   Fairview filed suit in December 1988, charging they should not
have been denied the contract, which involves about $2.5 million,
Wallis said.
   Last week, Fairview filed a motion asking that their case include
the claim that the Boston plan is unconstitutional.
   ``(The amendment) is a last ditch effort to try to get this
contract by Fairview,'' said Sciaba attorney John Spignesi.
   City Councillor Bruce Bolling, author of the ordinance, said he
believes the plan would meet the Supreme Court test because it was
based on the findings of a public hearing into discrimination in the
construction business.

   Police on Monday killed an alleged Moslem
fundamentalist leader of the outlawed Jihad organization, which was
blamed for killing President Anwar Sadat in 1981 and a failed coup
attempt, police said.
   A police source said on condition of anonymity that Maged
Mohammed Oteify was shot Monday night on a busy downtown street.
   The source said Oteify, 35, was a Jihad leader who had eluded
police for a long time.
   The source said police ambushed Oteify as he walked out of a
hospital on Galaa Street. When he tried to escape, they shot him and
later found he was armed with a hand revolver, the source said.
   Five Jihad members were sentenced to death for Sadat's
assassination, 17 others were given prison terms and two were
acquitted.
   In a later trial, 300 Jihad members were accused of trying to
overthrow the government after the assassination. The court
sentenced 107 to various prison sentences, but acquitted the rest.
Egyptian officials said 87 people, including 66 policemen, were
killed in the attempted coup.

<TEXT>
   The second-ranking official of the Laborers
International Union of North America, identified by a presidential
commission as having close ties to organized crime, retired Monday
and was replaced by his son.
   Arthur E. Coia, the union's secretary treasurer, announced his
retirement at the union's annual Executive Council session in Bal
Harbour, Fla. Arthur A. Coia, regional manager for the Laborers in
New England and eastern Canada, was immediately tapped to succeed
his father.
   Both men were mentioned in the 1986 report of the President's
Commission on Organized Crime, which said the union had ``clear ties
to organized crime.''
   The elder Coia, 75, once was indicted on racketeering charges for
allegedly accepting payoffs in return for steering union insurance
business to selected companies. But the case was dismissed because
the charges were filed after the statute of limitations had expired.
   The report, citing congressional investigations of organized
crime influence on organized labor, also accused Coia and his son of
involvement in schemes to bilk union health and welfare funds.
   The younger Coia, in a telephone interview, said both he and his
father were ``unfairly characterized'' in the report and had no
dealings with the mob.
   ``The mention of me and my father in that presidential commission
report is really not a detailed and fair representation,'' he said.
``The so-called link to organized crime does not exist.''
   The report also criticized internal union election policies,
including the provision that allowed the younger Coia, 45, to be
tapped to succeed his father.
   The Laborers union holds its convention every five years, when
delegates elect candidates to the Executive Council on an at-large
basis. If board vacancies occur between conventions, the remaining
board members choose a replacement, a policy the report said
``leaves few offices contested.''
   ``When the use of violence and intimidation are added, the
membership has little opportunity to express itself dramatically,''
the presidential report said.
   The hearings on which the report was based included testimony
that the elder Coia also sought to convince Robert Powell, a
longtime vice president of the union and one of its few black
leaders, not to run for union president.
   Powell testified that Coia told him the ``Italians'' had
organized the union and would always control it.
   The report accused the elder Coia and Laborers President Angelo
Fosco of abusive spending of union funds, including $200,000
authorized by Coia to pay for a private investigator to keep tabs on
a longstanding federal investigation of the union.
   Coia also ordered the union to pay $40,000 requested by his son
to cover legal fees stemming from a government investigation of the
union, the report said.
   There has been speculation that Focso might step down from the
union presidency this year, but the younger Coia discounted such
talk. ``I think the rumors are all false,'' he said.
   The Coias both are Rhode Island natives. The younger Coia, a
labor attorney by trade, has a law practice in Providence, R.I.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private group of scholars and analysts said
Monday that President Bush's proposal to bail out the savings and
loan industry does not provide enough money or reforms.
   The plan, announced last week, would provide $90 billion to close
or sell 350 insolvent S&amp;Ls and meet pledges made by regulators last
year in cleaning up 223 institutions.
   The Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, a group of 12
financial experts from colleges and consulting and law firms,
praised Bush for recognizing that the S&amp;L problem is much more
costly than previously acknowledged by the government.
   But, in a statement, it said, ``There is a strong possibility
that additional thrifts which are now marginally solvent will become
insolvent in the near future. Increases in interest rates may also
lead to financial difficulties for many more thrift institutions.''
   Meanwhile, in a separate development, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. on Monday took control of Midwest Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Association, an insolvent S&amp;L in Minneapolis.
   Midwest was the 11th institution taken over under a program
announced by Bush last week. The FDIC plans to assume control of
more than 200 S&amp;Ls, insolvent under regulatory accounting rules,
over the next four to six weeks.
   Although government regulators will be more strictly supervising
the institutions, the FDIC is emphasizing that all insured deposits
will continue to be fully protected.
   Arizona State University business professor Edward J. Kane, a
member of the shadow regulatory committee, estimated that 800 to 850
institutions of the nation's 3,000 thrifts are ``economically
insolvent'' even though regulatory accounting rules show a far
smaller number.
   ``Any increase in interest rates is ... going to put a lot (more)
institutions under water,'' said Franklin Edwards, a business
professor at Columbia University.
   The group did not offer its own figure to counter the
administration's $90 billion estimate, but Edwards said the red ink
could total as much as $130 billion.
   Edwards said Bush would be wise politically to deal with the full
problem now, early in his term. He also criticized the proposal to
raise $50 billion over the next three years by selling
``off-budget'' bonds. The interest costs would be less expensive if
the money were raised by borrowing directly through the Treasury, he
said.
   Bush's plan also reorganizes the regulatory structure by giving
the Treasury Department and the commercial bank insurance fund, the
FDIC, more authority over savings and loans.
   But, Kenneth E. Scott of the Stanford University School of Law
said the president's plan seem more aimed at ``moving boxes'' than
accomplishing real reforms.
   The committee advocated a program of early intervention that
would impose federal control when an institution weakened and force
the institution to shut down before it actually became insolvent.
That way, depositors would be protected and expenditures by the
federal insurance funds would be rare.

   An aunt of Gov. Joe Frank Harris, found
slain in her home over the weekend, was strangled, perhaps by a
robber, police said Monday.
   Allie Morrow Roper, 75, a sister of Harris' mother, Frances
Morrow Harris, was found dead Sunday morning after she failed to
pick up neighbors for church.
   Mrs. Roper apparently was killed Saturday night, said police Maj.
C.B. Siniard. Authorities found a shopping receipt from late
Saturday afternoon. She lived alone.
   There were ``signs of unlawful entry'' at her home, Siniard said.
``We're trying to determine with the family members if anything is
missing.''
   Mrs. Roper died of asphyxiation caused by strangulation,
according to the Bartow County medical examiner.
   She was found unclothed and bound, Siniard said.
   ``The brutal murder of my widowed aunt in Cartersville shocks not
only my family but the entire community, which knew Aunt Allie as a
dedicated and faithful church worker,'' Harris said in a statement.
   Mrs. Roper and her family operated a flower shop in Cartersville
for a number of years. A neighbor, Cecil Mauldin, said she trained
many of the florists in Cartersville, and ``was a friendly woman,
who would do anything for anybody.''

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas briefly resumed a
council on Monday and tried to choose a Moslem government, but two
important leaders did not attend and rival factions continued
wrangling over shares of power.
   Guerrilla sources said the seven groups in the Pakistan-based
guerrilla alliance were divided on who should lead an interim
government in Afghanistan and on apportioning the top positions.
Differences also arose over including insurgent groups based in
Iran, they said.
   Afghanistan is predominantly Sunni Moslem, as are most guerrillas
based in Pakistan. Most of the insurgents in an eight-faction
coalition that operates from Iran are Shiite Moslem, the sect of
their host country.
   Some spokesmen said the council, known as a shura, would resume
Tuesday and would consider major issues for the first time. Others
said there was little or no hope of progress.
   ``The whole situation is such that nothing can come out of the
council,'' said a senior official, who like the others spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Factionalism developed immediately Friday at the inaugural
session of the shura, which has been seen as the last chance for
feuding guerrilla groups to compromise, and it was suspended.
   Insurgent leaders predict the Marxist government in Kabul will
collapse soon after the last Soviet soldiers withdraw on Wednesday.
The council's job is to choose a government that would take over and
arrange elections.
   Aides said Sibghatullah Mojaddidi and Syed Ahmed Gailani, who
lead two of the seven parties, did not attend the Monday meeting and
leaders of the five other other parties presided over the council,
which did not consider major issues.
   Mojaddidi did not attend because the other six parties rejected
his proposal for bringing the Iranian-based guerrillas in, sources
reported.
   A spokesman for Mojaddidi said: ``The shura is not going to work
out without the Iranian-based mujahedeen,'' using the word for the
guerrillas that means Islamic holy warriors.
   Gailani aides said he had a scheduling conflict Monday but would
attend the meeting Tuesday. But guerrilla sources said that he
stayed away because of an argument about who would lead the interim
government.
   Guerrilla groups summoned the council of insurgents, Moslem
scholars and officials of past Afghan governments. Mojaddidi, who
now holds the rotating chairmanship of the Pakistan-based alliance,
has insisted the others honor his plan to give the Shiite groups in
Iran 100 of the more than 500 council seats and seven interim
government Cabinet posts.
   Most Sunni guerrilla leaders say the Shiites, an estimated 15
percent of Afghanistan's population, are too few to receive so many
seats. About 80 percent of Afghans are Sunni.
   Shiite representatives have said they will accept only the
Mojaddidi plan, but have not carried out their threat to leave
Islamabad.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communist
coup in April 1968 and Soviet soldiers entered the country in
December 1979, reaching an estimated total of 115,000 by May 15,
1988, when the Red Army began withdrawing under a U.N.-mediated
agreement.
   Pakistan, the United States, Iran and other countries have helped
arm and finance the guerrillas.

   Diana Ross says she is determined to do something
different as she returns to the stage after taking time out to marry
and give birth to two sons.
   ``People expect glitter and glitz from me,'' Ross said in an
interview in the March issue of Vanity Fair magazine. ``But you have
to change, too. ... You have to keep cutting the strings all the
time.''
   For the moment, Ross, 44, is planning to record an album and go
on a concert tour.
   Her career was launched in the 1960s as the lead vocalist of the
Supremes, and she says she has a ``motherly instinct'' toward the
young black singers of the 1980s.
   ``I love Whitney (Houston),'' Ross said.
   But envy of Houston's success is what propelled her to resume her
career, according to a friend who is quoted anonymously by the
magazine as saying, ``Diana would be competitive with a tree.''
   ``I have to be better than the best. Super-everything,'' said
Ross, who has kept a low stage profile since she married Arne Naess,
a Norwegian tycoon, in 1985. Ross gave birth to a boy in August, her
fifth child, and her second son with Naess.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers on Monday battled a small
band of civilian intruders at an army base about 435 miles west of
Buenos Aires, the government news agency Telam reported.
   It appeared to be low-key replay of the La Tablada incident three
weeks ago.
   Telam said a patrol discovered four or five civilians and opened
fire at about 5:15 a.m. on the base of Weapons Battalion 141 near
Rio Cuarto, south of Cordoba.
   Shooting continued for about 90 minutes until the civilians fled,
the independent news agency Diarios y Noticias said. Soldiers did
not pursue the civilians fearing that it may have been a
diversionary tactic, it said.
   One soldier was wounded. The attackers, whose goal and motive
were not known, all escaped.
   On Jan. 23, about 50 armed civilians crashed through the main
gate at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada on the outskirts of
Buenos Aires. By the time troops recaptured the base a day later, 28
intruders, nine soldiers and two policemen had been killed.
   The government of President Raul Alfonsin blamed leftist
subversives for La Tablada. Fourteen intruders were seized and were
imprisoned pending charges.

<TEXT>
   Hearings opened Monday at the World
Court in a dispute between the United States and Italy over the 1968
seizure of a U.S.-owned company, a court spokesman said.
   It is the first U.S. case to be heard since the Reagan
administration rejected a 1986 World Court ruling ordering it to
stop arming the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
   Boston-based Raytheon Co., an electronics company and defense
contractor, estimates it lost $6 million plus interest in the
takeover of its subsidiary company Elettronica Sicula S.p.A., said
Abraham Sofaer, the legal advisor to the U.S. State Department.
   Raytheon wanted to liquidate the Palermo, Sicily-based
manufacturer of cathode ray and vacuum tubes, but the Italian
government nationalized the company to save jobs on the island
plagued by unemployment.
   A five-judge panel is hearing the case, which is expected to
continue at least until Wednesday, the court spokesman said on
condition of anonymity. The Reagan administration filed the suit two
years ago for Raytheon, but only written arguments had been made
since then. Only governments can appear before the court.
   Formally known as the International Court of Justice, the
judicial branch of the United Nations has no enforcement powers and
depends on voluntary adherence to its rulings.
   Elettronica Sicula, also known as ELSI, was co-owned by Matchlett
Laboratories Inc., a U.S. company not involved in the case.
   The Italian government said expropriation of the company in 1968
was aimed at protecting the plant's 900 jobs after Raytheon and
Matchlett disclosed their intention to shut down the concern.
   The judicial panel consists of the court's president, Judge
Jose-Maria Ruda of Argentina, and Judges Shigeru Oda of Japan,
Roberto Ago of Italy, Stephen M. Schwebel of the United States and
Sir Robert Jennings of Britain.
   The case was filed in February 1987 after the Reagan
Administration rejected as invalid a World Court ruling in July 1986
ordering the United States to stop arming rebel forces attempting to
overthrow Nicaragua's leftist government.
   In apparent anticipation of that adverse ruling, the United
States had withdrawn in March 1984 its recognition of the unlimited
jurisdiction of the court, but said it would continue to accept the
court's authority in cases not connected with the Central American
issue.
   The ELSI case is the third one filed at the World Court by the
United States in a decade.
   In 1979, the United States asked the court to order the release
by Iran of 52 American diplomats held hostage in the U.S. embassy in
Tehran. The court, on an emergency basis, ruled weeks later that the
hostages should be released. They were ultimately freed in 1981.
   In the same year, the U.S. government and Canada jointly asked
the court to draw the boundary between the two nations in the Gulf
of Maine off North America's East Coast. That dispute was decided in
1984.

<TEXT>
   Actor Omar Sharif felt a bit old when he
joined fellow ``Lawrence of Arabia'' star Anthony Quinn and director
Sir David Lean for the local premiere of the restored 1962 Oscar
winner.
   Sharif watched himself ride across desert sands in his role as
Sherif Ali in the restored three-hour, 40-minute director's cut of
the movie, which won seven Academy Awards.
   ``It's like a veterans' reunion _ everyone's limping along and
has pot bellies,'' Sharif said after the screening Sunday night.
   ``I feel very nostalgic because I haven't seen it for 27 years,''
he said. ``It's like re-seeing your youth.''
   The ``Lawrence'' premiere followed similar galas a week ago in
New York and Washington. The screenings and banquets benefited The
American Film Institute and its campaign to restore and preserve
classic films.
   Lean, 80, urged Hollywood to take risks to make quality films.
   ``Spend some money on risky subjects,'' Lean said. ``It's no good
being safe in this business. We've all got to be gamblers.''
   Lean called the late Sam Spiegel, who produced ``Lawrence,''
``one of the last of the great gamblers that have disappeared,'' but
also criticized him for chopping the film.
   Lean's original version was cut by nearly 30 minutes shortly
after the film's release. Lean contends Spiegel made the first cuts
behind his back, but others have questioned Lean's version. An
additional 15 minutes was removed when ``Lawrence'' was reissued in
1971.
   Peter O'Toole, who portrayed T.E. Lawrence, didn't attend the Los
Angeles premiere. But the screening drew composer Maurice Jarre,
film editor Anne Coates and cinematographer Fred A. Young. All
three, along with Lean, won Oscars for the film, which won as best
picture of 1962.

   President Bush caught a football tossed by Jack
Kemp, who called himself ``a kinder, gentler quarterback'' after
being formally sworn in Monday as the new Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development.
   Bush made the first visit by a president to the Housing and Urban
Development Department since Jimmy Carter a dozen years ago to watch
as his former rival for the Republican presidential nomination was
administered the oath of office by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor.
   ``Jack's a man of ideas, and I've made clear I want him to apply
his creativity and energy to the area of housing and urban policy,
which are one of the most important and challenging issues in
America today,'' Bush said. ``These problems require a compassionate
strategy, and that's the reason I thought of Jack immediately and
asked him to take this job.''
   The references to football were frequent as Kemp, the former
professional football quarterback, invited a pair of friends to join
him for the ceremony _ Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, and Gene
Upshaw, president of the National Football League Players
Association.
   Gibbs brought a football and tossed it to Kemp, who tossed it to
Bush as hundreds of HUD employees watched. There were no
incompletions, but the passes hardly covered one yard.
   Bush called Kemp, who left the House of Representatives after 18
years, an ``all-pro congressman'' and ``a great quarterback'' at
HUD. Kemp, thanking Bush for his remarks, said, ``I particularly
liked the part, Mr. President, about a kinder, gentler quarterback.''
   Bush said his administration will push for urban enterprise
zones, using tax incentives to encourage job-creating business in
inner cities, and look for innovative ways to improve public housing
and make home ownership available to its tenants.
   ``I believe that given a chance, economic freedom can bring a
revival to the inner city, and it can create jobs and housing and
dignity for every citizen,'' Bush said.
   Kemp pledged to ``help end the appalling tragedy of
homelessness,'' and to expand the number of eligible families
receiving ``housing assistance and housing opportunities.''
   ``Our mission is to inject oxygen and seed corn and new life and
new hope into those distressed inner cities,'' Kemp said.
   Although the ceremony was held to swear in the new secretary,
Kemp has been on the job for a week. He received the oath privately
from the department's general counsel following his unanimous
confirmation by the Senate.

   The first Soviet ship to visit Israel in 22
years sailed into the southern port of Ashdod Monday to pick up 80
tons of relief supplies for Armenian earthquake victims, Israel
radio reported.
   The relief supplies, mainly clothing and flour, were blessed at
the port by an Armenian priest in long, black, flowing robes before
it was loaded on the 2,000 ton Vitya Novitsky.
   ``We are very proud that the Russians agreed to specially send a
ship from Turkey to pick up everything,'' peace activist Abie Nathan
told the radio.
   Nathan, who also directs the ``Voice of Peace'' radio station,
has made a personal campaign over the airwaves to solicit disaster
relief contributions.
   He also was instrumental in persuading the Soviets to send a
Soviet-flagged vessel to transport the supplies.
   It was the first time a vessel flying the hammer and sickle
stopped in an Israeli port since the Soviet Union broke diplomatic
relations with Israel after the 1967 Middle East war.
   For the past two years, the two countries have exchanged
low-level consular delegations and have increased cultural ties.
   Foreign Ministry officials have said they view the warming of
relations as motivated by a Soviet desire to play a part in any
future Middle East peace process.
   Israel sent two teams of relief workers to Armenia to aid rescue
efforts following the December earthquake which killed tens of
thousands.

   Moslem students marched in several
cities Monday against a book fundamentalists say blasphemes Islam.
Their rallies occurred the day after police fired on protesters in
Islamabad, killing five and wounding 83.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the protest Sunday may have
been the work of politicians using Moslem objections to Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' as an excuse to press their
opposition to her government and democracy.
   In India on Monday, police fired into a crowd protesting the book
in Srinagar, summer capital of northern Jammu-Kashmir state, killing
one person and wounding more than 60, news reports said.
   United News of India said the mob forced shops and businesses in
Srinagar to close. India, which is overwhelmingly Hindu, banned the
book in October.
   In a letter soon after the banning, published on front pages of
major Indian newspapers, Rushdie said: ``The right to freedom of
expression is at the very foundation of any democratic society.
   ``When ... self-appointed guardians of Muslim sensibilities say
that no civilized society should permit the publication of a book
like mine, they have got things backwards. The question raised by
the book's banning is precisely whether India, by behaving in this
somewhat South African fashion, can any more lay claim to the title
of civilized society.''.
   Rushdie was born in India to Moslem parents and lives in Britain.
   In Islamabad, hundreds of riot police were stationed around the
U.S. Information Center, scene of Sunday's confrontation, but no
trouble was reported Monday.
   Nearly 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists assembled outside the center
Sunday to demand that Rushdie's novel be banned in the United
States. It has been published in Britain, the United States and
other Western countries, and several Islamic countries have banned
it.
   Fundamentalists say the book does not recognize Islam as the one
true religion and ridicules the most precious Moslem beliefs.
Rushdie declares it to be a work of fiction, in no way blasphemous
and not intended to offend anyone.
   Ms. Bhutto said she did not see how Sunday's protest could have
been against the book because it is banned and unavailable in
Pakistan, and none of the protesters could have read it.
   ``Was the demonstration against Salman Rushdie's book or a
law-and-order situation?'' she said at an airport news conference
after returning Monday from a state visit to China.
   U.S. diplomats closed the information center and U.S. Embassy at
midday Monday after reports that more violece might occur.
   In adjacent Rawalpindi, where most shops were closed to mourn
those killed the day before, about 300 Moslem theology students and
opposition politicians chanted ``Rushdie should hang!'' and other
slogans against Ms. Bhutto.
   Witnesses said small groups of young men hurled stones at shops
which that remained open. There were no reports of injuries.
   Demonstrations were held at U.S. consulates in Lahore and
Karachi, but reports said police were out in force and prevented
violence.
   At the American center in Islamabad, which houses a library and
offices of the U.S. Information Agency, a diplomat said: ``The staff
is traumatized.''
   Three Americans and 15 Pakistani employees were inside the
building when a mob chanting ``American Dogs!'' and ``Allah Is
Great!'' pelted the building with stones, tore down the American
flag and started several small fires.
   Police responded with tear gas first, then fired rifles and
shotguns. All the dead suffered gunshot wounds, hospital sources
said.
   Ms. Bhutto was visiting China. Official Pakistani media quoted
her as blaming the bloodshed on a combination of a conspiracy
against her government and improper police action.
   The official English-language newspaper Pakistan Times, said in a
front-page editorial, ``It is hard to see how (the United States)
became the prime object of mob anger in the present case when both
the author and the first publication of the book belonged
elsewhere.''
   It suggested right-wing opponents of Ms. Bhutto used the issue to
embarrass her government.
   ``A blasphemous book, even if the government had nothing to do
with it other than strongly denouncing it, could have been seen by
some as an opportunity for mounting a popular uproar that could also
in some way be made to affect the government on the rebound,'' the
paper said.
   American diplomats said they did not know why the United States
became the target. An embassy statement Monday said ``The United
States government in no way supports or associates itself with any
activity that is in any sense offensive or insulting to Islam or any
other religion.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington:
``The government and the people of the United States have full
respect for the religious beliefs of the Pakistani people ... based
on constitutionally protected rights to freedom of worship and to
freedom of speech, which also guarantee the expression or
publication of a wide range of works, not all of which will be
acceptable in every society.
   ``We have full confidence in and satisfaction with the actions
taken by Pakistani authorities during this incident,'' he said of
Sunday's confrontation.

   Developer Donald Trump's announcement last month
that he would close the Trader Vic's bar in his lordly Plaza Hotel
boosted business so much that Trump says he'll let the saloon stay
awhile.
   Trump initially said the pseudo-Polynesian saloon was tacky
beyond toleration for the luxury hotel overlooking Central Park and
Fifth Avenue.
   But he told the New York Post that he can put up with the
tackiness a little longer because, with old customers trooping in
for a farewell drink, business at Trader Vic's has doubled.
   ``I'm in no hurry to close it. It's a very successful operation
now,'' Trump said. ``But since it's the greatest location in the
world, anything would be successful there.''
   The bar also got help from stories in newspapers ranging from the
Wall Street Journal to the Village Voice, and a New York Times
editorial pining over the passing of such Trader Vic's specials as
the Mai Tai or the Scorpion with floating gardenia, the Samoan Fog
Cutter or the Dr. Funk of Tahiti.
   The restaurant part of Trader Vic's, which operated from the
Plaza basement for 25 years, closed a year ago, but the bar stayed
open.
   Trump, who bought the Plaza last year for $390 million, said in
January that a classy Oriental restaurant and a health club would
replace Trader Vic's beginning in April or May.
   ``I now have no set timetable on this,'' he says now. ``I haven't
decided what to do with the space yet.''
   The Trader Vic's chain operates more than a score of restaurants
in the United States, Canada, West Germany and Japan.

<HEAD>Argentine Couple Held On Charges Of Stealing Masterworks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired Argentine police commissioner and his wife
were held Monday on charges of conspiring to sell stolen paintings
worth as much as $100 million by such masters as El Greco and Goya,
FBI officials said.
   Juan Carlos Longo, 53, and his wife, Hilda, 40, who have homes in
Buenos Aires and Miami, were held without bond in pretrial detention
after being arrested last week, the FBI said.
   During the investigation, Longo told an informant, posing as a
dealer of stolen artworks, that 11 paintings stolen from Argentine
museums were split between two groups in Argentina, and one of the
groups was composed of police officials, according to an FBI
affidavit.
   Longo told the informant that people who stole the paintings
``paid for their freedom'' by giving ``half the paintings to police
officials,'' said the FBI affidavit from agent James D. Keith.
   Some of the information in the affidavit was corroborated by
taped conversations, the international law enforcement agency
Interpol, and the Argentine government, the FBI said.
   The Longos were arrested at the Westin Hotel on Feb. 6 after the
informant set up the purchase of ``Doves and Hens,'' a masterpiece
by Goya, allegedly stolen from the Castagnino Museum of Rosario,
Argentina, on March 24, 1987, the FBI said.
   The ``Doves and Hens'' piece was valued at $500,000, said FBI
spokesman Paul Miller. The worth of the 11 stolen paintings was
placed between $50 million and $100 million, Miller said.
   Longo was arrested after turning over the Goya painting to an
undercover agent posing as a wealthy art expert representing foreign
investors, the FBI said. His wife was arrested as she waited in a
car outside.
   The Longos' attorney, Fred Schwartz, did not contest the pretrial
detention. ``I may appeal detention to a district judge,'' Schwartz
said, ``but first I want to hear the tapes.''
   Miller said the FBI is working closely with Argentine federal
police.
   ``We are providing them with information and they are providing
us with information and we understand there will be arrests in
Buenos Aires,'' Miller said.
   The FBI affidavit told of two separate Argentine robberies
involving the theft of masterpieces.
   A 1983 robbery from the Estevez Municipal Museum in Rosario
bagged five paintings, including those by Bartolome Esteban Murillo,
Sanchez Coelmo, and El Greco.
   In March 1987, the Castagnino Museum lost six paintings in an
armed robbery, including works by Magnasco Alessandro, Tiziano
Vecellio and Goya.
   The affidavit said that a confidential informant in October was
approached by Longo, who offered to sell masterpieces stolen in
Argentina.

<HEAD>Iran To Hang 70 Drug Smugglers in One Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iran says it will hang 70 drug traffickers
Tuesday, the highest number to be executed in one day in that
nation's fierce anti-narcotics crackdown aimed at stopping the flow
to at least 1 million addicts.
   Hard-line Prosecuter-General Musavi Khoeiniha said in a recent
radio interview: ``This is the end of the line. If we do not destroy
them (drug smugglers) they will destroy our youths.''
   Khoeiniha first gained fame in 1979 as the guiding hand behind
the militant extremists who stormed the U.S. Embassy, holding 52
hostages for 444 days.
   Iran instituted a new law on Jan. 21 that includes the death
penalty for anyone found with 30 grams (just over an ounce) of
heroin or five kilograms (11 pounds) of opium or hashish. Addicting
someone else carries a 20-year sentence.
   The law coincided with a crackdown that put helicopter gunships
into the air along the borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan to
track smugglers.
   On Jan. 16, a record 56 drug smugglers were executed. The
official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, says
105 smugglers have been executed since Dec. 31.
   The Iranian resistance group Mujahedeen Khalq accuses the Iranian
government of creating hysteria over the drug problem as a means of
extending a siege mentality and eliminating its enemies following
the 8-year Iran-Iraq war.
   An IRNA report on Tuesday's executions said 10 will be hanged in
Tehran and the rest in cities throughout Iran.
   Executions were suspended during a 10-day celebration that ended
Feb. 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the revolution that toppled
the late Shah in 1979.
   Iranian police released statistics Monday saying 3,300 drug
traffickers have been arrested in Iran since 1987 and 11 metric tons
of opium, 1,540 pounds of heroin and 2.3 metric tons of hashish
seized.
   Drug addicts now have six months to kick the habit or face jail.
Addiction is not considered a medical problem in Iran.
   The prosecutor-general said: ``If an addict's decision to give up
his habit is serious he needs nothing else. They should not expect
the government to treat them as patients.''
   Iran has blamed everyone from underground opposition movements to
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for trying to turn Iranian
youth into addicts.
   Iranians leaving the country said many youths turned to drugs to
escape the intense pressure they faced to conform to Islamic
principals as Iran was reborn as a fundamentalist state.
   The draft in the ``holy war'' against Iraq was another factor,
they said.
   Iranian press reports concentrate on ways of eliminating drug
supplies rather than the cause of addiction.
   Khoeiniha said one way around the death penalty was to turn
others in.
   ``If they (smugglers) report themselves, repent, name old traders
and cooperate with discovering the rings certainly we will request
the great leader (Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini) to grant them parole.
Otherwise ... they will be punished according to the law.''
   In other developments in Iran on Monday:
   _Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani denied in an interview
allegations of a power struggle within Iran's top leadership, and
dismissed reports in world media of mass executions of political
opponents, Tehran radio reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Rafsanjani responded to a
question from a French TV journalist asking about reports from
Amnesty International that more than 1,000 political foes were
executed since summer.
   _Iran announced it planned to free 260 disabled or ailing Iraqi
prisoners of war next week, Tehran radio said in another report.
   In Geneva, President Cornelio Sommaruga of the International
Committee of the Red Cross expressed concern about the slow
repatriation of prisoners and said Iran and Iraq were not fulfilling
their international obligations. U.N. officials estimate the number
of war prisoners in both countries at 100,000.

<HEAD>Immigration Service Regains Access to Asylum Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday overrode
local authorities and ordered the reopening of a refugee processing
center that was padlocked last week as a health and fire hazard.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela set aside at least temporarily
an order Friday by a state district judge that had barred the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service from using the center in
Harlingen.
   ``There's between 200 and 300 people outside there right now
waiting to be processed,'' Omer G. Sewell, INS director in
Harlingen, 25 miles north of this border city, said shortly after
the court action.
   Later, he said immigration officials regained access to the
building and planned to begin seeing applicants again Tuesday
morning.
   More than 2,000 people a week, most from Central America, have
been applying for political asylum at the INS Harlingen office. Many
of the applicants have camped near the building while waiting for
their paperwork to be processed.
   City officials, who had sued in state district court to be
allowed to padlock the center, said they would comply with Vela's
order once they've seen it.
   ``As far as I am concerned, it (the center) is still closed. I
have not been served (with Vela's order),'' said Gavino Sotelo,
Harlingen city manager. ``The conditions at the center remain the
same as they were before. There is trash, there is human waste. If
this goes on, we might have to close it all over again.''
   Harlingen Mayor Bill Card said once the center is open, the city
will regularly inspect it and will notify Sewell of any violations
found.
   ``We just want to make sure that the facility is operated
properly. If it had been operated in a responsible way before, it
would have never been closed,'' Card said.
   Sewell said barring the INS from the building in Harlingen would
have created another crisis of homeless Central Americans in the Rio
Grande Valley.
   The last such crisis led Vela to issue an order Jan. 9 to force
the INS to allow the applicants to pursue their cases at their
intended U.S. destination after checking in with the INS in
Harlingen.
   Huge crowds also gathered at the building when it was used for
processing those who applied for amnesty under the Immigration
Reform and Control Act of 1986.
   The current backlog involves the immigration policy that calls
for refugee status for those found to be fleeing for political
reasons, but deportation for undocumented aliens entering for
economic reasons.
   In overturning a Friday order by state District Judge Robert
Garza, Vela said it ``prohibits the functions and operations of an
agency of the federal government.'' Vela also barred Harlingen
officials from restricting INS access to the 9,872-square-foot
former furniture store and from interfering with INS business there
``in any manner whatsoever.''
   He said, however, that his order should not be interpreted to
mean the INS does not have to comply with state or local laws or
ordinances related to public health and fire safety.

<HEAD>Snow, Freezing Rain for Much of the Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Monday from western New York state across western
Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and much of Virginia and West
Virginia after snow earlier in the day slacked off in Illinois,
Wisconsin and Michigan.
   Heavy rain in western Kentucky forced the temporary closing of
portions of at least three roads and high water covered 33 others,
highway officials said.
   Storms in Illinois produced from 2{ to 5 inches of snow in
Chicago, 4 inches or more at Rockford and Moline, 2 inches at
Peroia, and an inch at Springfield.
   Snowfall during the morning included 2 inches at Detroit and
Grand Rapids, Mich., Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wis., and Roanoke, Va.
At least an inch fell in Charleston, W.Va., Lander, Wyo., and
Pocatello, Idaho.
   Snow also extended from the remainder of Michigan across
Wisconsin and northern Minnesota, as well as from western South
Dakota across Wyoming, western Montana, Idaho, northern Nevada,
northern Utah and Colorado.
   By early afternoon, freezing rain was scattered over southeastern
West Virginia and southeast lower Michigan. Rain reached from Ohio
across the remainder of West Virginia, from southern lower Michigan
across Kentucky, southern Illinois, southern Missouri, northern
Arkansas and the southeast half of Oklahoma into north central Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees at Yellowstone Wyo., to 83 degrees at McAllen, Texas. The
low temperature for the nation Monday morning was 11 degrees below
zero at Gunnison, Colo. and Massena, N.Y.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for snow showers to extend from
the Rockies across the upper Missouri Valley and North Dakota. Snow
also was expected in northern Maine, changing to rain from central
Maine across Maryland and Delaware, the lower Great Lakes across the
upper Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the southeast third of
Missouri and southern Illinois. Rain and thundershowers were
expected from the lower Mississippi Valley across northern and
central Alabama.
   High temperatures were forecast for single digits and teens from
northern Minnesota across North Dakota and Montana. Highs in the 20s
and 30s were expected from northern Maine across the remainder of
the Great Lakes, from northern Ohio across the remainder of the
upper and central Mississippi Valley, from South Dakota across
Kansas, Wyoming, northern New Mexico, the Rockies, the Great Basin
of Nevada and western Utah and the northern Plateau west of the
central Rockies. Temperatures were expected in the 60s from Virginia
to near 80 degrees over Florida, the central Gulf of Mexico coast,
the lower Mississippi Valley, and much of Texas. Highs in Southern
California and southwest Arizona were expected in the 60s. High
temperatures over the remainder of the nation were expected in the
40s and 50s.

<HEAD>North Lawyer Says Reagan Involved in Helping Contra-Supporting Nations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 7th graf to show Reagan attorney declining comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan ``participated
personally and directly'' in giving favored treatment to countries
that supported the Contras in Nicaragua, lawyers for Oliver North
said in a court filing aimed at having charges against their client
dropped.
   North attorney Brendan Sullivan, opposing a compromise between
the independent counsel and the Justice Department, said in court
papers released Monday that the proposed deal on keeping certain
secrets out of the trial would prevent him from introducing this
evidence which he said was central to North's defense.
   He also criticized Attorney General Dick Thornburgh for declining
``to take the political heat'' and make a separate
secrets-protecting move that could lead to charges being thrown out.
   Sullivan said, ``At the heart of this case are the quid pro quo
and other third-country arrangements with which the Reagan
administration obtained military support for the resistance during
the so-called Boland Amendments, and the policy that those
third-country arrangements would not be disclosed outside a limited
group of executive branch officials.''
   The Boland amendments, passed by Congress, restricted and at
times prohibited the spending of federal funds in support of the
guerrilla war against the leftist government in Nicaragua.
   Former National Security Adviser John Poindexter testified at the
congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 that Reagan favored
making up for that lack of official U.S. support with money from
other nations. But the assertion that Reagan was personally involved
in arranging to return the favors is new.
   Theodore Olson, an attorney for Reagan, declined comment on
Sullivan's filing after its contents were described to him.
   Sullivan's statements were in a written response to U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, objecting to a new plan for protecting
national security secrets at North's trial.
   The plan, worked out by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh and
the Justice Department, ``would gut the defense and guarantee a
`cuckoo-clock' trial,'' Sullivan said. It would hide ``critical
information about the Reagan administration's third-country
arrangements for military support of the resistance and the official
nondisclosure of those arrangements.''
   Sullivan said that the way the government proposed to present
this information to the jury _ through a general ``admission'' with
no details allowed _ would leave out ``that President Reagan and top
executive branch officials participated personally and directly in
those arrangements.''
   He said under the government proposal, the jury would never hear
about ``direct personal participation in the third-country
arrangements'' by Reagan and these officials of his administration:
National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, Poindexter's
predecessor; Secretary of State George Shultz; Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs John Vessey, and the
late CIA Director William Casey.
   Most of the details of the proposed court agreement were kept
secret, but their intent was to establish nine specific categories
of information that cannot be revealed by North in his defense.
   Sullivan urged that Gesell reject the proposed rules out of hand.
   The proposed agreement between Thornburgh and Walsh is a
compromise to deal with Justice Department objections that rules
under which the trial was to be conducted would allow North to
disclose important national security information.
   Gesell is to conduct a hearing on the agreement Tuesday.
   The beginning of the trial was put on hold Sunday when Chief
Justice William Rehnquist of the Supreme Court granted the Justice
Department's request for a stay. However, the department has said it
will ask Rehnquist to lift the stay if Gesell approves the agreement
on testimony involving classified information.
   Sullivan said in his court filing, ``If imposed by the court, the
stipulation could cripple the defense of this case. ... We cannot
adequately defend this case without this information.''
   He also attacked Thornburgh for not using an avenue open to him
for stopping classified information from coming out _ filing an
affidavit under the Classified Information Procedures Act. Such an
affidavit would force the judge to bar the information and could
result in dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal charges
against North.
   ``The attorney general apparently does not want to take the
political heat associated with filing an affidavit that could result
in sanctions afffecting the triability of the case, even though he
has a clear duty to protect the national security,'' Sullivan said.
   ``It is understandable that if the case is untriable, the
attorney general would rather blame someone other than the
administration.''
   Last month, two major counts against North were dismissed after
Thornburgh refused on national security grounds to allow the use of
classified material deemed essential in the case.
   Reacting to Sullivan's comments, David Runkel, a Thornburgh aide,
said the attorney general ``has been in public life more than 20
years. He's never been unwilling to take political heat if the cause
is just.''
   Sullivan said in his new filing that the proposed
Walsh-Thornburgh agreement ``would guarantee a `cuckoo-clock' trial
that would make a mockery of the adversarial process.''
   Gesell has promised he won't hold a ``cuckoo-clock'' trial _
meaning he doesn't want constant interruptions at the trial for
challenges on whether a document can be disclosed.
   With the issue of national security disclosures still unsettled
Monday morning, Gesell sent the jurors home, telling them to check
by telephone for their next court date.
   The nine proposed categories of secret material that can't be
used include information that would identify undercover CIA
officers, the locations of CIA stations, identities of foreign
individuals who work for the spy agency and details about CIA
operations with foreign intelligence services.
   Also included would be material about American intelligence
collection on terrorism and eforts to locate hostages, U.S. covert
activities other than military support for the Contras, and names of
non-Central American countries that supported the Contras.
   Instances of quid pro quo efforts involving North surfaced in the
Iran-Contra congressional hearings.
   For example, on March 5, 1985, he proposed that Guatemala be
rewarded for its assistance in providing false end-user certificates
so that more than 98,000 pounds of East European munitions could be
delivered by chartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to a
Central American country for the Contras.
   In a memo to McFarlane, then the national security adviser, North
suggested that the secretaries of state and defense and Vessey of
the joint chiefs be asked to grant Guatemala additional security
assistance.
   The purpose of the memo, said North, was to ``find a way by which
we can compensate'' Guatemala ``for the extraordinary assistance
they are providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.'' North said
he was attaching ``end-user certificates'' which Guatemala
``provided for the purchase of nearly $8M worth of munitions to be
delivered'' to the Contras.
   There was no indication what became of North's request.

   Three black men have signed
statements saying Winnie Mandela was ``involved in the events'' the
night her bodyguards abducted and beat them, their lawyer said
Monday.
   Mrs. Mandela, a black activist and the wife of jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, denies the allegations. Her
daughter, Zindzi, was quoted Monday as saying Mrs. Mandela will sue
the Sunday Star, an anti-apartheid newspaper that reported she
helped whip the victims.
   The men, aged 20 to 29, were released from Mrs. Mandela's home
after community leaders intervened. The three earlier had been
identified as being teen-agers.
   A fourth youth, 14-year-old Moeketsi ``Stompie'' Seipei, is
missing and feared dead.
   Prominent anti-apartheid lawyer Geoff Budlender said his three
clients are considering legal action.
   The three ``say they were abducted _ three of them and Stompie _
and they were all assaulted on the first night. They say she (Mrs.
Mandela) was involved in the events on the first night,'' said
Budlender. ``They say Stompie was removed from them a day or two
afterward and they never saw him again.''
   He declined to elaborate, saying his clients have not authorized
him to release details of the statements they gave him.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, has denied she was at home when the bodyguards,
known as the Mandela United soccer team, brought the four there late
last month.
   But she also has defended the bodyguards, saying they took the
four from a Methodist Church residence to protect them from sexual
abuse, a charge the church said it investigated and found false.
   Krish Naidoo, an attorney who has been acting for Mrs. Mandela,
said Monday he no longer will represent her. ``I felt it was not
within the scope of my work to deal with the Mandela crisis,'' he
was quoted as saying by the South African Press Association.
   The Weekly Mail, another anti-apartheid newspaper, broke the
story two weeks ago with accusations the released men made at a
community meeting. Community leaders have appealed for the boy's
return.
   Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, a well-known anti-apartheid physician,
reportedly saw the beaten boy at the Mandela home ``and warned that
Stompie had been so badly assaulted that he would not live,'' the
Sunday Star reported.
   The next day, Asvat was shot and killed at his Soweto office by
two young men pretending to be patients. Police are investigating
whether the killing is linked.
   Mrs. Mandela says she does not know what has happened to the
14-year-old. The boy's mother says she believes he is dead.
   The Weekly Mail reported Friday his body was found, but police
say they have no information about it.
   Zindzi Mandela was quoted Monday as saying her mother would hold
a news conference after meeting with her husband, who is held at a
house on a prison farm near Cape Town.
   The independent South African Press Association also quoted Miss
Mandela as saying her mother plans to sue The Sunday Star and The
Weekly Mail.
   Nelson Mandela is serving a life sentence for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the government.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says Cambodian Peace Talks Will Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk says peace talks opening Feb. 19 will fail because
the pro-Vietnamese government in Cambodia has imposed unacceptable
conditions, the resistance radio reported Monday.
   The Voice of the Khmer, monitored in Bangkok, quoted Sihanouk as
saying government opposition to deploying an international
peace-keeping force in Cambodia would allow the return of the Khmer
Rouge regime, which killed hundreds of thousands of people in
1975-78.
   The Phnom Penh government, which Vietnam installed after invading
the country in December 1978, also rejected Sihanouk's demand that
it be dismantled and join a provisional government that would
supervise a general election.
   These issues are to be discussed at a second round of peace talks
planned for Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, starting Sunday.
   The talks will bring together communist Vietnam; the Cambodian
government of Premier Hun Sen, and the three-party resistance
coalition, including Sihanouk's group; the Khmer Rouge, and the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front of former
Cambodian Premier Son Sann. Other Southeast Asian nations also will
take part.
   According to the resistance radio, Sihanouk recently said in
Beijing that the talks ``would not be successful because the
resistance forces cannot just submit themselves to the Vietnamese
colonialist regime as required by Hun Sen's conditions.''
   Sihanouk ``affirmed that more than anything else, he wants peace
for the Cambodian people,'' the broadcast said. ``But peace without
independence is worthless.''
   Sihanouk has said he will not attend the Jakarta talks because
Hun Sen rejected his peace proposals. But his son Prince Norodom
Ranariddh will represent him.
   Sihanouk, widely expected to take a leading role in any future
Cambodian government, is at his home in China. The Chinese arm the
resistance against the Soviet-supplied Vietnamese.
   The radio said the prince had no plans to meet President Bush,
who visits Beijing late this month, or with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, who is due there in mid-May. But Sihanouk said he was
ready to meet them anytime, if asked, the broadcast said.
   A Thai army official meanwhile disclosed Monday that more than
7,000 Cambodian refugees who were evacuated from two Khmer Rouge-run
camps because of heavy shelling from across the Cambodian border
have returned to their camps at Ta Luan and Borai, just inside
Thailand.
   Much of the shelling that peaked in mid-November was directed at
an area just inside eastern Trat province, where the Khmer Rouge had
herded about 7,000 refugees, apparently to prepare to populate
strategic areas of Cambodia.
   Gunners in Cambodia continued to pound Khmer Rouge positions near
the Thai-Cambodian border, one month after the refugees all moved
back, said Paynai Sirirat, chief coordinator of the Displaced
Persons Protection Unit. He said the Khmer Rouge sustained heavy
casualties.

<HEAD>North Alleges Armistice Violations, Demand End To Exercises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea on Monday accused South Korea
of a sea intrusion and two shootings across the border and blamed
U.S.-South Korean military exercises for suspended reconciliation
talks.
   Maj. Gen. Choi Ui Ung, senior North Korean delegate to the 446th
meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission in this truce
village, demanded the annual military exercises be stopped, calling
them provocations and an obstacle to talks between the communist
north and the pro-Western south.
   The general said the intrusions occurred between Feb. 3 and 12
and were ``grave provocations.'' No injuries were reported.
   The United Nations Command, which comprises the United States and
other Korean War allies, said one shooting incident across the
border was caused by ``an accidental firing'' and that the north was
already notified about it.
   The command promised to investigate the other alleged incidents.
   Choi blamed the United States and South Korea for the suspension
of Friday's scheduled parliamentary meeting in the same location.
   Pyognyang unilaterally boycotted the meeting, saying the joint
exercises called Team Spirit were offensive and preparations for a
nuclear war against the north.
   U.S. Navy Rear Adm. William T. Pendley, speaking for the United
Nations Command, said the north was using Team Spirit as an excuse,
but he did not elaborate.
   North Korea has called for removal of all 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Pendley also renewed his command's previous demand that North
Korea return all United Nations Command remains from the 1950-53
Korean War that ``you have publicly acknowledged that you are
holding.''
   Allied officials said the war remains included at least those of
two Americans. There was no North Korean response in the two
hour-meeting.
   The admiral renewed his command's perennial offer to invite North
Koreans to come to the south and observe Team Spirit. The North did
not respond as in the past. The exercises were reported to have
begun last week but there was no official confirmation.
   The north also demanded an end to Team Spirit on Wednesday, when
government officials from both Koreas met in Panmunjom to discuss
plans for the two Koreas' first meeting of prime ministers. No
progress was made because of the north's refusal to take up
procedural matters unless the south agreed to end Team Spirit.

   Florida should move ahead with plans
to develop the nation's first commercial spaceports on Florida's
Space Coast and in the Panhandle, Gov. Bob Martinez said Monday.
   Martinez told a news conference he will recommend legislation
creating a Spaceport Authority to oversee the project and will
include $10 million in his budget proposal for the effort.
   ``When America enters the space commerce industry, it should be
from Florida,'' the governor said, adding the spaceport could make
use of many existing facilities at Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy
Space Center.
   ``Here in Florida we are uniquely positioned to serve as
America's launching pad,'' he said. ``We have the time, we have the
place, we have the talent, and we have the resources.''
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner appeared with
Martinez and said the federal government fully supports the Florida
effort, as well as similar efforts being pushed by Hawaii and
Virginia.
   ``Florida is leading in many aspects of the competition,''
Skinner said. ``The state that provides the money and effort to make
this work will get the most government support.''
   A Spaceport Florida study says that a facility for launching
small rockets that carry instruments to take various scientific
soundings should be built at Cape San Blas, near Port St. Joe in the
Panhandle's Gulf County. It also recommends two potential sites near
the Kennedy Space Center _ Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, using
three inactive launch pads once used for Atlas and Titan missiles,
and the abandoned town of Shiloh.
   Martinez said he is directing the Florida Department of Commerce
to take steps to develop the facility at Cape San Blas and to
determine which of the two sites near the Kennedy Space Center would
be best for launching large payloads into orbit.
   The study estimated the Cape San Blas site could be developed for
about $200,000 and could be open in nine to 12 weeks. The Air Force
once launched sounding rockets and many facilities are still
available.
   According to the study, development of an orbital launch
facilities on the east coast would require about three years.
   Ralph Christi, project leader for United Engineers and
Construction, the consultant that did the study for the state, said
a spaceport could be funded like an airport, through revenue bonds
or corporate debt.

<HEAD>Hastings Seeks Impeachment Dismissal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings on
Monday asked the Senate to dismiss 16 of the 17 articles of
impeachment returned against him last August by the House of
Representatives.
   The 52-year-old Florida jurist claimed in a 95-page motion that
15 of the 17 counts against him should be dismissed based on his
acquittal in a 1983 trial and the length of time since then in
bringing the impeachment proceedings against him.
   In its bill of impeachment, the House accused Hastings of
conspiring with a Washington attorney to receive a $150,000 payoff
in exchange for a guarantee that two racketeers would not serve time
in prison.
   Hastings, the first black federal official ever to be impeached,
was acquitted in a 1983 trial on that charge, but the articles of
impeachment also accuse him of making false statements and
fabricating evidence in that proceeding.
   The only article of impeachment which Hastings didn't seek to
have dismissed is one which accuses him of disclosing secret wiretap
information in an unrelated investigation to Steve Clark, the mayor
of Dade County, Fla.
   In his motion with the Senate, Hastings contended through
attorneys that an impeachment trial on 15 of the 17 motions
constitutes double jeopardy in view of his acquittal by a criminal
court jury and also denies him due process because witnesses have
died and records have been lost since then.
   The motion seeks dismissal of the final, 17th article on grounds
that it is a ``catch-all'' count aimed at allowing the Senate to
remove Hastings from the bench with a finding that he is unfit even
if a majority finds him innocent on each of the 16 other articles.
   The House has until March 3 to file a brief in reply to Hastings'
motion Monday. No date for oral arguments on the motion has been set.
   The Senate Rules Committee earlier this month ordered that
arguments on the anticipated motions be heard by the full Senate
even though only a 12-member panel of senators will conduct the
evidence hearings, which are expected to take about six weeks.

<HEAD>Colorado Senator Announces He Will Not Seek Re-Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. William Armstrong, a Colorado Republican who
has served in Congress since 1973, said Monday that he will not seek
re-election in 1990.
   Armstrong, 51, told reporters at a news conference in his Denver
office that he was tempted to run, but two terms is enough.
   ``I have never believed the great opportunity, or the greatness
of this country is centered in the U.S. Senate,'' he said.
   ``I thought that 12 years was about the right length of time.''
   Armstrong, who served from 1973-78 as a congressman and at
various times has been eyed as a candidate for president and vice
president by fellow conservatives, is Colorado's senior Republican
officeholder in Congress.
   ``I love to campaign. So heading out on the campaign trail to
meet people, shake hands and make speeches would be great fun. Based
on polling and the advice of friends who have offered to help, I
believe I would have a good chance to be re-elected,'' he said.
   But Armstrong added, ``I have considered myself and have wanted
others to think of me as a citizen legislator serving in Congress
for a time, but always with a firm intention of returning to private
life.''
   He said he would remain active in politics and did not close the
door on a run for the governorship.
   ``It's conceivable,'' he said. ``I won't rule it out. Who knows?''
   Armstrong said he will devote his time to unspecified business
concerns. He owns television stations in Twin Falls and Pocatello,
Idaho, and is building one in Jackson, Wyo.
   For years, Armstrong owned and worked at KOSI, a major radio
station in the Denver market. A born-again evangelical Christian, he
did several commercials for a Bible study organization before his
re-election in 1984.
   He maintains an interest in evangelical religion, he said, but he
does not plan to enter what he called ``the vocational ministry.''
   ``I don't see myself in that role.''
   Armstrong said he also would consider establishing his own
foundation or think tank.
   His announcement means there will be a wide-open race for his
seat in 1990. Republicans mentioned as possible contenders include
state Sen. Terry Considine, state Rep. Chris Paulson, and U.S. Reps.
Hank Brown and Joel Hefley. Armstrong would not say Monday whether
he planned to endorse anyone as a possible successor.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. Richard Lamm, who had been
considered a likely candidate, announced recently he would not seek
the seat, but State Democratic Chairman Buie Seawell and U.S. Rep.
Ben Nighthorse Campbell are believed to have a strong interest in
running.
   Before being elected to the Senate in 1978, Armstrong represented
Colorado's 5th Congressional District, which includes Colorado
Springs. Before that, he spent a decade in the Colorado Legislature,
serving as Senate majority leader from 1969-72.

<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization
answered U.S. criticism by saying Monday it was not resorting to
terrorism but was resisting Israeli attacks.
   The commentary, carried by the Palestinian news agency WAFA,
responded to remarks by U.S. Secretary of States James Baker to
reporters over the weekend in Iceland.
   The remarks appeared to be a warning that attacks by Palestinian
guerrillas against Israeli civilians or soldiers, either inside or
outside Israel, could threaten the newly established U.S.-PLO
dialogue.
   Israeli soldiers killed five PLO guerrillas during a clash in
south Lebanon on Feb. 4. Israel said the guerrillas were trying to
infiltrate and that the PLO had not abandoned attacks on Israeli
targets. It urged the United States to break off its dialogue with
the PLO, which opened in Tunis on Dec. 16 after chairman Yasser
Arafat renounced terrorism.
   The WAFA commentary accused Baker of trying to impose a double
standard, ``prohibiting to the Palestinian people what it allowed
the Afghan resistance.''
   ``The PLO is not resorting to terrorism, but resistance,'' the
commentary said. ``It is Israel that is practicing terrorism every
day while the Palestinian people are organizing legitimate
resistance against the occupation, thus exercising a right in
conformance with international law and convention.''
   The commentator told Baker not to try to get the PLO to ``abandon
the resistance in order to be able to continue the U.S.-PLO
dialogue.''
   ``We engaged in this dialogue with the aim of finding a just
solution to the Palestinian problem and to realize the inalienable
rights of this people,'' the commentary said.
   ``The resistance and the uprising will stop only when it has
achieved its legitimate rights, including that of creating a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Manley was sworn in on Monday
for the third time as prime minister of Jamaica and said his
government is already establishing relations with ``our most
powerful neighbor,'' the United States.
   ``We are an island, but we are not alone,'' said Manley, 64, who
led a socialist government in the 1970s but swerved toward the
political center in recent years.
   Manley, prime minister from 1972-80, took the oath of office in
an hour-long ceremony before about 3,500 guests on the lawn of
King's House, official residence of the British governor-general,
Sir Florizel Glasspole.
   Diplomats and other guests sat before the platform under a
brilliant sun on the eastern side of the rambling, colonial-style
mansion.
   Glasspole, as representative of Queen Elizabeth II, administered
the oath with the same Bible used by the Caribbean nation's first
premier, Sir Alexander Bustamante, in 1962, the year Jamaica gained
independence from Britain.
   Jamaica belongs to the Commonweath, the global association of
former British coloniies and territories, and Manley swore
allegiance to the queen ``and her heirs and successors.''
   Manley won a five-year term in a landslide victory last Thursday
over conservative Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who held the office
for eight years and was one of the United States' closest allies in
the region.
   Manley and Seaga attended a special ecumenical ``service of
national peace and unity'' Sunday to set a conciliatory tone at the
outset of the new government. Violence during the three-week
campaign left 13 people dead.
   Manley, who has said he wants to visit Washington as soon as
possible, told the gathering he would seek good relations with
Jamaica's traditional allies.
   ``We are already well-advanced in the establishment of our
relations with the new administration which guides the affairs of
our most powerful neighbor, the United States of America,'' he said
to applause.
   ``She's our biggest trading partner, our largest source of
tourists, with the greatest potential for foreign investment.''
   He singled out U.S. Ambassador Michael Sotirhos in the audience,
saying he wanted to pay tribute to him ``for his even-handedness
before the election and for his immensely energetic assistance once
it became clear that the people of Jamaica had made their choice.''
   On domestic matters, Manley repeated his pledge to work with
Seaga in clamping down on illegal guns and drugs and in fostering
unity among political factions.
   He warned ``there may be economic trouble on our horizon'' as a
result of the costly election campaign and the aftereffects of
Hurricane Gilbert, which hit the island on Sept. 12, killing 45
people and causing $1 billion damage.
   The Electoral Office had no breakdown of the popular vote, but
Manley's People's National Party was declared the winner Thursday
night with 57 percent of the unofficial tally to 43 percent for
Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party.
   Complete but unofficial results gave Manley's party 47 seats in
Parliament to 13 for Seaga's party.
   Manley and Seaga attended a special ecumenical service Sunday to
set a conciliatory tone. Violence during the three-week campaign
left 13 people dead.
   In contrast to the policies of his previous government, which
appropriated private farms and hotels, Manley says he wants to give
private enterprise a free hand in boosting production and has
``abandoned all thoughts of nationalization.''
   In the 1970s, Manley sought close ties with Cuba's Fidel Castro
and spoke out against alleged CIA plots and capitalism, alienating
the United States and foreign investors and plunging Jamaica into
economic chaos.
   Manley has said he would restore relations with Cuba but would
also restrict Cuban influence in Jamaica to avoid antagonizing the
United States.
   Manley has said he would honor Jamaica's $3.8 billion foreign
debt, but is seeking a new approach to reducing the burden of
interest payments on developing countries.
   Although Manley's term is five years, he can call the next
election earlier. Seaga, 58, becomes leader of the official
parliamentary opposition.

<HEAD>Rubber Seals Punctured While Awaiting Installation at Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vandals are believed to have punctured six rubber
seals that shut off water running from a St. Lucie nuclear plant
reactor to the steam generator, authorities said Monday.
   The plant, near Fort Pierce on Florida's southeastern coast, was
inactivated for refueling at the time and the damage was caught
before the seals were installed, said Stacey Shaw, spokeswoman for
Florida Power &amp; Light Co.
   Damage to the seals, which are intended to stop water flow to the
generator during inspections, were discovered Feb. 7 during a
pre-installation check.
   ``There is basically little safety significance attached, but the
fact that they were apparently vandalized is significant,'' said Ken
Clark, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
regional office in Atlanta.
   He said although the water going to the generator might be
radioactive, any leak caused by the punctures would have been
spotted immediately even if they had somehow been installed. In
addition, Ms. Shaw said, the rubber seal must be inflated before
installation, and the punctures made that impossible.
   The vandalism apparently occurred during the three days before
the inspection. During that time, the seals were on a loading ramp
one day and in the containment building for the next two days, Ms.
Shaw said.
   ``We've interviewed a couple of dozen people that were in the
area over the three-day period, and so far they have not uncovered
anything,'' she said.
   She said the utility has written a letter to plant personnel
asking for help in the investigation, but so far has identified no
suspects.
   It was possible the seals had been damaged by accident, she said,
but emphasized the company was proceeding on the assumption it was
vandalism.
   If a suspect is identified, he or she would be subject to federal
criminal charges, Ms. Shaw said.
   The FBI was informed of the incident, but was not actively
involved in the case, she said.
   Clark said the NRC sent an inspector to the plant after the
discovery, but was now monitoring the utility's internal
investigation.
   Ms. Shaw said she did not expect the incident to hold up the
restart of the 850-megawatt Unit 2, which was shut down for
refueling at the end of January and should be back on line after 12
weeks.
   She also said the incident was not considered serious enough to
cause a change in safety procedures at the plant.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Gaston Caperton on Monday proposed
a ``bold and agressive'' program of cuts and said the state still
has to borrow as much as $765 million to pay its bills, improve
schools and develop economically.
   Caperton, making his first State of the State address, said he
wants to abolish the jobs of agriculture commissioner, secretary of
state and treasurer. The governor also asked for 5 percent pay
raises for public school teachers and state workers.
   The first-term Democrat presented lawmakers with a proposed
$1.781 billion budget for 1989-90, with budget cuts averaging 4.5
percent for all state agencies except education, health and human
services. The current state budget is $1.464 billion.
   ``The program I have presented ... is bold and aggressive,''
Caperton said. ``It will most assuredly bring out the critics, but
it will also bring out the best in West Virginia, and in us.''
   Caperton defeated three-term Gov. Arch Moore last year in a
campaign that assailed Moore's financial management. A special
legislative session earlier this month approved $392 million in tax
increases to help close a growing deficit and boost the state's
economy, which has been hurt by a slump in its dominant industries,
especially coal. Caperton asked for no additional revenue other than
the borrowing authority.
   The current projected state deficit is $260 million by June 30,
the end of this fiscal year, and $376 million by next year.
   The borrowing would include:
   _up to $500 million for school construction, including raising
$120 million in bonds reissued through the 1972 Better Schools
Amendment.
   _$135 million to be obtained from private lenders, possibly a
consortium of West Virginia banks.
   _$130 million, to be repaid through tolls, as part of a plan to
replace the West Virginia Turnpike with the West Virginia Parkway
Economic Development and Tourism Authority.
   Caperton proposed two constitutional amendments: one to eliminate
the jobs of agriculture commissioner, secretary of state and
treasurer; and one to allow cities and counties to decide on their
own form of government, including the possibility of forming joint
municipal-county governments or even merging two or more counties.
   Gubernatorial aide Phil Reale said the proposed amendments, which
must be approved by two-thirds of both the House of Delegates and
Senate, probably would be placed on the ballot for voter
ratification in a special election this fall.
   The 5 percent pay raise for teachers and state employees would
depend on whether the state can save $40 million to $45 million in
the first six months of the 1989-90 fiscal year.

   Senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping held ``very
friendly and nostalgic'' talks Monday with Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto of Pakistan and recalled her father's friendship with past
Chinese leaders, Pakistan's ambassador said.
   ``I knew your father very well,'' Ambassador M. Akram Zaki quoted
Deng as telling Ms. Bhutto at a 40-minute meeting in Shanghai.
   The evening television news showed Deng holding his hands up
palms together to greet Ms. Bhutto in Moslem fashion, smiling
broadly as he did so.
   Zaki said the talks covered a general survey of Pakistani-Chinese
relationship, with some reminiscences by Deng about Ms. Bhutto's
father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted Deng as saying:
``Your father was a friend of the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Your
parents established a special relationship with the late Premier
Chou En-lai and his wife, Deng Yingchao. I personally have had
contacts with your family for a long time.''
   The elder Bhutto, president from 1971-73 and prime minister from
1973 until he was ousted in a 1976 coup and later executed, made
friendship with China a key element of his foreign policy.
   By choosing China for her first official foreign trip since being
elected last November, Benazir Bhutto sought to emphasize this
longstanding tie. The two sides signed agreements to extend a trade
protocol and encourage mutual investment, but expressions of
friendship dominated over substance.
   ``The torch of Pakistan-China friendship has been passed on to a
new generation who will surely ... pass (it) on to the next
generation,'' Xinhua quoted Ms. Bhutto as telling Deng.
   ``It was a very successful visit,'' Zaki said as Ms. Bhutto
prepared to leave Shanghai for home. ``The meetings with all the
top-ranking leaders produced complete identity of views.''
   Ms. Bhutto also met Monday with President Yang Shangkun and on
Sunday with Premier Li Peng and Communist Party General Secretary
Zhao Ziyang.
   Zaki reported the 84-year-old Deng meeting ``in very good
health.''
   He said the Bhutto-Yang talks included the current Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan after 10 years and said ``both hoped .
.. there would be a broad-based government peacefully established.''
He did not elaborate.
   Ms. Bhutto later confirmed to Western reporters that she met in
Beijing with Iran's ambassador to China, Alaeddin Broujerdi, and
discussed the disputes between Pakistan-based Afghan guerrillas and
those based in Iran. She gave no details.
   The guerrillas, aided by Pakistan, Iran and the United States,
have been fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government since 1978.
The main dispute is over sharing of power after the Soviets leave.
   Afghanistan and fear of Soviet ambitions in Asia have been major
factors in Chinese-Pakistani ties. Mutual hostility with India has
been another. China recently held a fence-mending summit with India
and plans one with the Soviet Union in May, but relations with
Pakistan are expected to remain close.

<HEAD>Protestant Group Claims Responsibility For Slaying Of Catholic Lawyer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with Finucane's widow also criticizing
British official's comment and denying husband was IRA member. Pick up

<TEXT>
   A Protestant vigilante group
claimed responsiblility Monday for killing a prominent Roman
Catholic lawyer. His widow and and Irish nationalists accused a
British official of making him a target.
   Patrick Finucane, who acted for clients involved in the outlawed
Irish Republican Army's campaign against British rule, was fatally
shot Sunday night by three men who stormed his home in north Belfast.
   His wife, Geraldine, was shot in the ankle but was in
satisfactory condition in a hospital. Their three children were not
hurt.
   On Monday, the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters telephoned a
coded message to the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast claiming
responsibility for the attack. The group said it ``shot Pat Finucane
the Provisional IRA officer, not Pat Finucane the solicitor.''
   ``While the Provisional IRA threaten and shoot Loyalist
(Protestant) construction workers ... the inevitable retaliation
will take place,'' the statement said.
   The IRA has targeted workers who do maintenance and construction
work for the police and British army in Northern Ireland.
   Mrs. Finucane denied her husband was an IRA member.
   ``Pat was a solicitor (attorney) who worked for human rights and
civil liberties. He defended both Catholic and Protestant alike,''
she said in a statement to the British domestic news agency Press
Association.
   She also criticized junior Home Office Minister Douglas Hogg for
telling a parliamentary committee discussing an anti-terrorist bill
that some Northern Ireland lawyers were ``unduly sympathetic'' to
guerrilla groups. Hogg's remarks were raised in the House of Commons
on Jan. 31.
   ``We firmly believe that it was instrumental in Pat's death,''
she said.
   Danny Morrison, vice president of the IRA's legal political arm,
Sinn Fein, said Hogg's comment provided the ``pretext for the
slaying of Mr. Finucane.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the British Cabinet minister
responsible for the province, said Monday he believed Hogg's
comments had nothing to do with the slaying.
   ``Not at all,'' King said. ``I think that Mr. Finucane was well
known for the work he did for the clients he had.''
   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey called the
killing a ``particularly disturbing development'' and a ``major
attack on the system of justice in Northern Ireland.''
   He defended lawyers in Northern Ireland as acting
``conscientiously, impartially and courageously to anyone in the
community who has been accused of a crime.''
   Finucane, 38, was involved in the County Armagh inquest into the
1983 police killings of three unarmed IRA guerrillas. He also
succeeded in having charges dropped against a man in connection with
the killing of two soldiers at an IRA funeral last year.
   The predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to
push the British out of this Protestant-dominated province and unite
it with the Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Singer and Manager Part Ways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Michael Jackson and his personal
manager for five years, Frank Dileo, have severed their
relationship, it was announced Monday.
   Dileo gave Jackson career guidance and direction since the pop
superstar hit worldwide acclaim with his 1983 ``Thriller'' album,
and he has been described as a father figure to the eccentric
entertainer.
   Jackson and Dileo ``have announced an amicable parting,'' said a
terse statement from Jackson publicist Lee Solters. ``I thank Frank
for his contribution on my behalf during the past several years,''
the statement quoted Jackson as saying.
   ``That's all the information that was given to me,'' Solters
said. ``I asked a lot of questions and they said that's all we can
tell you.''
   Dileo had been vice president of promotion for Jackson's record
company, Epic, before being named the singer's manager. In that
position, Dileo led a team of advisers that attended to the singer's
business and personal needs.
   The move was the second major management shakeup in popular music
this year. Last month, Prince fired his personal manager, his law
firm and his business manager.
   A few weeks before his severance, Dileo described his
relationship with Jackson in fond terms.
   ``We go out together a lot at night,'' he said. ``We go to record
and clothing stores on Ventura Boulevard goofing around. We ride
around looking at the sites. We have a ball.''
   Jackson just completed what the singer said would be his last
concert tour, a 16-month worldwide jaunt tied to the release of
Jackson's ``Bad'' album. The singer's next studio album isn't due
before 1991.
   Solters said ``no comment'' when asked whether Jackson's
intention not to tour again had anything to do with the split.

   Suspected leftist guerrillas on Monday
assassinated the mayor of an Andean town, police said.
   Police quoted residents of San Jose de Quero as saying about 15
armed and hooded guerrillas broke into the home of Mayor Maaximo
Clemente Cairo and led him into the street, where two of the gunmen
shot and killed him.
   Clemente Cairo, 33, was a member of the center-left Aprista Party

   The town, 125 miles east of Lima, is in a region that has seen
activity by the Maoist group Shining Path and the pro-Castro Tupac

<HEAD>Report: Arrest Warrants Sought For 150 in Market Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government moved Monday to issue arrest
warrants for 150 employees of stock brokerage firms on charges of
illegal trading related to the October 1987 stock market crash, the
government news agency said.
   The Notimex agency quoted Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe as saying
he asked the federal attorney general to issue arrest warrants for
employees of the Operadora de Bolsa and Mexicana de Valores e
Inversiones firms. The report did not say on what specific charges
the arrests were being sought.
   An official with the office of Attorney General Enrique Alvarez
del Castillo said by telephone that no one was available to comment
on the case Monday night.
   Roberto Hoyo D'Addona, the fiscal attorney general, said last
week the Treasury Department was investigating reports of illegal
trading by all but one of Mexico's 24 registered brokerage firms.
   He said his department received 50 complaints of alleged fraud by
stockbrokers stemming from the crash. Officials uncovered no
evidence of wrongdoing on the Mexican Stock Exchange in five of
those cases, he said.
   The Treasury Department is responsible for enforcing securities
and tax laws, but it must ask the federal attorney general to
perform any arrests of suspects.
   Illegal trading allegations surfaced after the October 1987
crash, when Mexico's market index plummeted by 74 percent in 28
trading days.
   A spokesman for the attorney general said last week that more
than 200 investors lodged complaints against stockbrokers alleging
that brokers speculated in the market or invested clients' funds
without their knowledge.
   A congressional panel voted on Wednesday to summon D'Addona,
Deputy Attorney General Luis Porte Petit and Oscar Espinosa
Villareal, president of the National Securities Commission, to
testify about the fraud allegations.

<TEXT>
   A summit of the five Central
American presidents bogged down on opening day Monday in a dispute
involving Nicaragua and at least two other nations over how to
appraise progress toward democracy.
   An adviser to the Sandinistas said earlier Monday that Nicaragua
was making strong democratic commitments because it believes the
rebel movement is dead.
   ``With the Contras' military defeat and the passing of the Reagan
administration, the external military threat to the Nicaraguan
government that impeded democratization is gone,'' said Paul
Reichler, a U.S. lawyer employed by Nicaragua as an adviser and
representative.
   Later, however, foreign ministers Miguel D'Escoto of Nicaragua
and Ricardo Acevedo of El Salvador clashed publicly over whether
commissions to monitor progress toward democracy should include
Central Americans or foreign participants.
   ``We have the moral authority to select a commission of Central
Americans. We should carry out our own verification,'' Acevedo told
a news conference.
   ``It seems to us somewhat anti-democratic that it should be we
ourselves who appraise our own actions,'' D'Escoto told a separate
news conference.
   The two spoke as presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Jose
Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador, Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras,
Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and Oscar Arias of Costa Rica worked in
closed session late into the first day of a two-day summit.
   Costa Rica reportedly was siding with El Salvador in the dispute.
   ``They're going at each other quite harshly,'' said a member of
the Nicaraguan delegation, commenting on condition of anonymity.
   The meeting intends to breathe new life into the stalled
Esquipulas II plan designed to promote peace and demcoracy in the
region.
   Since the presidents signed the accord in August 1987,
Nicaragua's regional partners _ especially El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Honduras _ have criticized Nicaragua for what they alleged is an
authoritarian Sandinista regime.
   ``The political problem in the region is one of democracy _ of
totalitarianism versus liberty,'' Acevedo said.
   Officials with the Nicaraguan delegation said Ortega proposed a
bilateral agreement with Honduras that calls for the estimated
11,000-strong Contra force there to be disbanded. The Contras fled
to Honduras after U.S. military aid expired last year.
   Under the proposal, the Contras could take advantage of an
amnesty offered by the Sandinistas or go to third countries under
the supervision of international organizations. The Sandinistas
would release the estimated 3,500 Contras and former Nicaraguan
national guardsmen now in Sandinista prisons.
   The officials said Ortega presented the plan to Azcona at the
Feb. 2 inauguration of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez.
   The five presidents first appeared encouraged by the mere fact of
being under the same roof after six months of delay. The summit was
rescheduled and postponed five times.
   ``I am sure that we, with optimism, will analyze efforts we've
made according to Esquipulas II and search for favorable solutions
that will promote peace and progress in Central America,'' Duarte
said as the meeting began.
   All the chief executives except Ortega, in a green army uniform,
wore casual attire fitting the climate of this seaside resort 40
miles southeast of San Salvador.
   They had intended to mark the anniversary of the signing with a
summit in August, but could not agree on an agenda.
   After some initial success, the Arias plan stalled last year.
   Officials said the summit's principal subject would be enforcing
compliance with the injunction against using one signatory's
territory as a base for attacking another, but the presidents
disagree on verification mechanisms.
   Arias is said to favor a commission of Central Americans, but
Nicaraguan officials said their government wants the United Nations,
the Organization of American States and human rights groups included
on such a panel.
   All the presidents expressed support for the framework
constructed last week by their foreign ministers in talks with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The ministers want ``an impartial mechanism'' created for on-site
verification of compliance. The tentative idea is to form an
observer group from Canada, Spain and West Germany.
   Arias, the 1987 Nobel Peace laureate, said the summit would
``re-establish our credibility with the Central American people and
the entire world.''
   A decade of civil conflict and economic depression have
transformed the region of 25 million people into a zone of
turbulence. An estimated 160,000 people have been killed in wars in
a decade and most Central Americans live in extreme poverty.
   Civil wars still plague El Salvador and Guatemala but the scale
has been reduced greatly in Guatemala.
   The Contras signed a preliminary cease-fire with the Sandinistas
last March but Ortega's government stands accused of failing to make
good its pledge to strengthen democratic institutions and practices.
   El Salvador's Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
Marxist-led insurgent army, announced a two-day truce for the
meeting.

   An ``excessively permissive'' attitude by
institutions tends to allow careless and sometimes even fraudulent
medical research, a national Institute of Medicine committee
reported today.
   The committee, empaneled to study misconduct in biomedical
research, said better research standards and systematic ways of
investigating laboratory irresponsibility are needed. ``Although the
committee believes that serious misconduct in science is rare ... it
concludes that institutions fail to detect and correct early deviant
behavior primarily because of an excessively permissive research
environment that tolerates careless practices,'' the committee
report said.
   Funding pressures and an overemphasis on publication of research
in scientific journals also encourage what the committee called
``substandard practices.''

   Religious leaders say there's no turning back from
women in the Episcopal Church hierarchy now that a 2,000-year,
all-male bastion has been broken by the Rev. Barbara C. Harris'
consecration as a bishop.
   Presiding Bishop Edmond Lee Browning, spiritual leader of the
Episcopal Church, said Harris' consecration Saturday ``means that
this church is realizing the wholeness of ministry, the totality of
ministry, and I'm sure that others will be following Barbara in the
days ahead.''
   The Rev. I. Carter Heyward, one of 11 women ``illegally''
ordained in a 1974 service in Philadelphia that paved the way for
the Episcopal Church's approval of women clergy two years later,
said Harris' consecration was ``a major step'' for the denomination.
``I think we still have a long way to go,'' she added.

   Americans widely disbelieve the Palestine
Liberation Organization's claim to have abandoned terrorism but
favor the U.S. dialogue with the PLO and the establishment of a
Palestinian state, a poll shows.
   Nearly seven in 10 respondents to a Media General-Associated
Press survey approved of the United States holding talks with the
PLO, and six in 10 said Israel should follow suit.
   But just 6 percent of the 1,162 adults said they believed the
PLO's recent renunciation of terrorism, and 74 percent said they
thought the group only made that claim for political gain. The rest
were unsure. The poll indicated other misgivings about the PLO.
Respondents were split on whether the organization would coexist
with Israel or still seek to destroy it, regardless of its
recognition of the Jewish state in December.

   A questionnaire assessing beliefs about alcohol
can identify adolescents who are likely to drink excessively within
a year of taking the survey, a study says.
   The 90-item test also may indicate what steps would best help
each individual avoid problem drinking, researchers said. Junior
high school students who believed alcohol could help them think or
improve their physical coordination tended to be at particular risk,
said Mark Goldman, a psychology professor at the University of South
Florida in Tampa.
   His study in this month's Journal of Consulting and Clinical
Psychology is the first demonstration that a measure of
psychological dependency can predict later alcohol use and
tendencies toward problem drinking, said G. Alan Marlatt, director
of the Addictive Behaviors Research Center at the University of
Washington in Seattle.

<HEAD>Disappearing Partners Charged With Insurance Scam, Theft, Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH GRACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If not for insurance company routine,
Melvin Hanson might still be dead _ and living comfortably somewhere
under another name.
   Hanson complained of chest pains last April. Dr. Richard Boggs
said Hanson came to his Glendale, Calif., office, then collapsed and
died of a heart attack. Hanson's business partner, John Hawkins, had
the body cremated.
   It wasn't the perfect crime, but it came ``extraordinarily
close,'' Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Al MacKenzie said Feb.
6 outside the courtroom where Boggs denied charges of murder,
conspiracy, theft, insurance fraud and assault with a stun gun.
Boggs, held without bail, faces the death penalty.
   ``If a couple of things hadn't gone our way, it could really have
been perfect,'' Columbus police Detective James Lanfear said
recently.
   Hanson and Hawkins, partners in the Columbus-based Just Sweats
athletic wear chain, face the same charges in what authorities say
was a plot to fake Hanson's death and collect on $1.5 million in
life insurance while making off with up to $2 million embezzled from
their company.
   ``You're talking some real serious planning here,'' said Lanfear.
   Hanson, 47, was arrested Jan. 29 at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, carrying $14,000 in cash and 14 ID cards _
including one for the alias he allegedly assumed in Miami after his
``death'' _ and the driver's license of Ellis Henry Greene, the man
who actually died in Boggs' office.
   Hawkins, 25, remains at large, with $1 million in insurance money
and $200,000 from company accounts, but without $500,000 from two
other policies. ``He's lived off the streets since he was 17. He's
been around. He knows how to hide,'' said Lanfear, who would have
preferred to catch Hawkins first. ``He's younger and I think he
would have talked. I'm afraid Hanson won't talk.''
   The scheme, according to authorities and court records, went like
this:
   Beginning in May 1987, Hanson bought $1.5 million in life
insurance policies from Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. of
Mercer Island, Wash., naming Hawkins as beneficiary. He signed a
will leaving everything to Hawkins, and directing that his body be
cremated and no relatives notified of his death.
   In January 1988, Hanson rented a Miami condominium using an
alias. The next month he consulted a plastic surgeon about changing
his appearance, told some friends and co-workers about chest pains _
and some that he had AIDS _ then left for California, where he once
had lived.
   Hanson stripped Just Sweats accounts of as much as $1.8 million
before he left April 15 for Los Angeles. That left the company the
pair founded in 1985 with assets of $1.4 million and liabilities of
$2.3 million; it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in
August.
   ``I guess I can say I'm disappointed in them,'' said Melissa
Mantz, the Just Sweats vice president who took control of the $8.5
million-a-year company after Hawkins gave her power of attorney in
an apologetic letter saying the ``pressures of running the business
have totally driven me almost crazy.''
   ``I don't think you could print what I feel deep down,'' Mantz
said.
   On April 16, Hanson and Boggs killed Greene, 32, a drifter who
once lived in Ohio. The method was unusual, MacKenzie said,
declining to be more specific until a preliminary hearing scheduled
for Feb. 21.
   Boggs called police April 16 and said Hanson had collapsed and
died in his office after complaining of chest pains. Glendale police
did not question the identity and marked the case closed. The death
was listed as natural.
   Hanson left Los Angeles the same day, using the name Wolfgang von
Snowden, and Hawkins flew to Los Angeles to claim the body. Hawkins
collected $1 million from the insurance company July 8 and left
Columbus about a week later after parking his car at an airport lot
with the keys in the ignition.
   The night before, roommate Erik DeSando told The Wall Street
Journal, Hawkins ``spilled his guts,'' blurting out that Hanson
wasn't dead and that his disappearance was insurance fraud. Law
enforcement officials believe the pair used an insurance scam
involving a staged robbery of furniture and paintings they were
renting to bankroll Just Sweats, the Journal said.
   ``John was always thinking up scams,'' DeSando said.
   Hanson underwent cosmetic surgery a month after the killing, and
began using the name and identification of Greene, as well as the
von Snowden alias. Hawkins went to Colorado, where he used the name
Jerry Anthony Greene.
   Vincent Volpi, a Columbus private investigator hired by Farmers
New World Life, turned up a von Snowden connection after he took two
bags of garbage from the curb in front of a Columbus condominium
Hawkins shared with DeSando.
   ``It's a procedure that we use a lot more than I'd like to think
about, but it's very successful. People throw out a lot of evidence
with the trash,'' said Volpi, who found December 1987 telephone
bills showing a call to Miami.
   He learned that the Florida condo was being rented by a man who
called himself Wolfgang E. von Snowden. DeSando remembered seeing a
note written by Hawkins that said: ``Distance myself from Wolfgang.''
   Von Snowden named Hawkins as an emergency contact and a reference
on his rental application for the condo, gave as a previous address
Hanson's Columbus apartment, the California driver's license number
he gave was Hanson's expired license, and his listed employment was
as an inactive partner in Just Sweats, The Columbus Dispatch
reported, citing leasing records.
   A few weeks after the death in Boggs' office, at the request of
Farmers New World Life, police obtained a copy of Hanson's
California driver's license and compared it with a photo of the dead
man. The license hadn't been on the body, but credit cards and a
birth certificate had. The resemblance was strong, but the man's
thumbprint revealed him to be Greene.
   The Los Angeles County coroner's office changed the official
cause of death to undetermined, and police began to investigate a
homicide.
   Boggs ``was tricked and bamboozled by Hanson and Mr. Hawkins,''
defense attorney Sammy Weiss said outside the neurologist's
arraignment. ``There's a tremendous resemblance between Mr. Hanson
and Mr. Greene,'' Weiss said.
   Boggs, 55, told the Journal that although he had seen Hanson for
annual check-ups for seven years, he was ``not in the business of
ascertaining identifications. ... I thought I was treating Melvin
Hanson.''
   Nine months after he supposedly died, Hanson was nabbed as he
returned from Acapulco, Mexico, apparently to sell some property in
St. Petersburg, Fla. He was arraigned in Texas on theft charges and
agreed not to fight being returned to Ohio, where he now is being
held on $5 million bond.
   Asked by the Texas judge if he could afford to post the bond, he
replied: ``If they let me die a few more times, I can.''

   Hundreds of thousands of Third World immigrants
struggling to make a living in Italy have found a spokeswoman and
role model in a 33-year-old former maid from Cape Verde, the island
republic off northwest Africa.
   She is Maria de Lourdes Jesus, Italy's first black television
anchorwoman, host of a weekly program that highlights the problems
of foreigners and tries to break down racist stereotypes.
   ``Without a doubt it's a great responsibility,'' said Ms. Jesus.
``Whoever speaks out on these problems is seen as someone who can
have some influence or can do something about them. I just try to do
my best within the limits of possibility.''
   Her program on the state-run RAI network is called ``Non Solo
Nero,'' which literally means ``not just black'' and is derived from
the name of another popular show, ``Non Solo Moda,' not just fashion.
   The program has examined, among other things, the problems of
immigrant families separated by their jobs, foreigners in jail,
racially mixed marriages, sexual harassment and housing
discrimination.
   To make its point, the show recently had a woman call to ask
about an apartment advertised as being for rent. The telephone
conversation was put on the air. After inquiring about the rental,
the woman in the studio said: ``By the way, I'm Somalian. I hope
that doesn't matter.''
   ``Yes it does,'' the woman on the other end said and hung up.
   Ms. Jesus said she's received compliments from strangers in the
street and numerous letters praising the program, marking what she
hopes is the beginning in a change of attitudes toward immigrants.
   ``This program shows that we're beginning to see the fruits of
the efforts of all the foreign communities in Italy trying to make
known their situation and the need to improve it,'' she said in an
interview, sitting in her small office under an anti-racism poster.
   ``This is the first time a program of this type has been on the
air. It's a very first step. Now people are beginning to talk about
our problems and trying to confront them.''
   Still, Ms. Jesus said, she is not satisified with the time
allotted to the program, just 15 minutes on Saturday afternoons, and
complains that RAI devotes more time each week to pets.
   ``More time to the problems of dogs than to foreigners,'' she
said. ``It's crazy.''
   Since the program first went on the air in November, Ms. Jesus
has also been a target of the same racism she is trying to eliminate.
   Leaving her home one night she was taunted and cursed by a young
man who recognized her from television. On another occasion, she was
riding in a car with several friends, including three Italian
television technicians of dark complexion, when they were stopped by
police.
   ``They made us get out of the car, with machine guns drawn, and
the first thing they said was, `You're all foreigners, right?''' she
said.
   ``I consider these incidents as things that happen, but I've had
other, positive experiences. I have so many Italian friends. It's a
very nice atmosphere.''
   Ms. Jesus, called Lou by her friends, was born in Cape Verde, a
former Portuguese colony. She moved with her family to Lisbon,
Portugal's capital, at age 12 and three years later joined her
sister in Italy to work as a maid.
   She worked her way through high school and won a scholarship to a
university, getting a degree in education. She gradually became
involved in defending the cause of immigrants and formed an
association to represent the 8,000 Cape Verdians living in Italy.
   When RAI decided last fall to broadcast a program on the problems
of immigrants, she was a natural choice for host.
   Ms. Jesus speaks fluent Italian with a slight Portuguese accent.
The newsmagazine L'Espresso described her stylish look as that of a
``woman executive ... always elegant.''
   Third World immigration is fairly new to Italy. There are an
estimated 1 million immigrants, mostly from Africa and Asia, many
without legal documents. Italians, who long considered racism
someone else's problem, are now confronting the issue themselves.
   ``Generally, Italians are apparently open, friendly and
hospitable people,'' Ms. Jesus said. ``But when it comes to personal
and work relations, they often manifest a racist attitude,
especially toward Africans. The stereotypes are amazing.''
   She said she didn't notice any racism in her early years in Italy
because her community was closed and isolated from the outside
society. But things changed when the immigrant community grew and
decided to organize.
   ``Then you begin to realize what your concrete possibilities are,
the many difficulties and the resistance,'' Ms. Jesus said.

<HEAD>Water Tank Sculptures Capture Disappearing City Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When archaeologists dig up Lisa Harris' sculptures
centuries from now, they'll find clues to yet another era that has
gone down the drain.
   In the past month, the 35-year-old artist has created some 20
terra cotta water tanks, ranging from 2 inches to 2 feet. To Harris,
it's a way of commemorating the real-life rooftop towers, which to
her resemble monuments to the industrial age.
   ``I'm a child of the city and think there is a lot of beauty to
be found in the city's ugliness,'' Harris said.
   But the artist's models have been disappearing, with demolition
teams casting them them off the city's skyline faster than she can
cast them in clay.
   The rooftop tanks have been here since the late 1800s, when the
city was rebuilding from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. They were
put on the high-rises of the time, buildings more than several
stories high.
   The filled tanks improved water pressure and served as resevoirs
from which to draw during emergencies. They were a craft in
themselves, at first made like wooden barrels with tongue-and-groove
seams so perfect that no extra seal was needed to hold the water.
   Harris found the models for her art in a changing industrial area
on Chicago's Near North Side. She drove there on another errand late
last year and decided to get out of her car and tour on foot.
   ``There was a whole vista of them,'' she said.
   She photographed some, sketched others. She studied the tanks,
trying to decide what techniques and materials she could use to
reproduce the ladders, capture the colors and portray the peeling
paint and weathered wood.
   Then, in her studio, she began constructing them, throwing clay
on a potter's wheel and adding hand-built parts for tops, stilts and
buildings. She fired them in a kiln and chose 10 for the show,
naming some for streets where she'd seen the real tanks.
   But by the time the exhibit opened Jan. 20, three of the real
tanks had been knocked down.
   ``Better water pumps have negated their use,'' said Lawrence
Acker, president of the Plumbing Contractors Association.
   Insurance companies still discount premiums for buildings with
tanks because the reservoirs provide extra protection, Acker said.
But a wave of housing rehabilitation work in recent years is
hastening the demise of the vessels. Old factories with tanks are
being converted into town houses with more modern plumbing. Old
schools are being gutted for lofts, and old housing is being made to
look newer.
   ``Progress,'' Harris said.
   Meanwhile, her exhibit will continue this month at the Lill
Street Gallery, a studio, gallery and ceramics school housed in a
building that was a horse barn when Lill Street was at the edge of
the city and at the end of the trolley line.
   Harris, a teacher at the school, says so far people seem to be
intrigued by the show.
   ``It looks stark,'' she said. ``It looks like a Chicago
cityscape. ...''
   The way it used to be.

<HEAD>A Kinder, Gentler Cliche</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kindly, gently, and, it seems interminably, the
phrase that became a George Bush cliche is being used for him,
against him and all around him.
   The president spared it another repetition in what amounted to
his State of the Union address Thursday night _ he spoke of decency,
compassion, generosity, government that helps people, but he skipped
``kinder and gentler.''
   Bush was one of the few orators who did.
   ``A kinder, gentler America?'' House Speaker Jim Wright said in
the Democratic response to the president. ``That's the old time
Democratic religion. We embrace it enthusiastically.''
   There is the matter of agreeing on what it means. Wright said
words and gestures won't do _ it will cost money. By Democratic
reckoning, considerably more money than Bush proposes to spend.
   Wright finds the phrase a handy one. ``Obviously this is not a
kinder, gentler budget,'' the speaker said when President Reagan
sent Congress his farewell spending proposal.
   Bush adjusted spending priorities, notably by reducing the
proposed Pentagon budget, but Democrats still used the K word and
the G word to criticize his proposal.
   ``He's offering a minimum down payment on a kinder, gentler
America,'' said Sen. James Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the
Budget Committee. ``But I can't see how he's proposing to meet the
necessary installment payments. They might have to repossess his
kinder, gentler America for failure to meet the payments.''
   But Richard Darman, Bush's budget director, said the new
administration's budget would, too, make the nation kinder and
gentler, although perhaps not as rapidly as everyone would like.
   Kinder and gentler than the Reagan administration?
   ``Well, I'm not saying that,'' Darman replied.
   He said the Bush budget seeks more money for education,
environmental cleanups, aid to the homeless, Medicaid for the needy
and like programs. ``If they are marks of a ... kinder, gentler
society, then it meets that test. ...''
   Democratic National Chairman Ronald H. Brown quickly joined the
oratorical game. Praising the achievements of Democratic governors,
Brown said ``for these leaders, kinder and gentler doesn't come from
the pen of some ghost writer. It comes from the heart.''
   Brown, installed last Friday, said the next time the
administration says ``we need leadership that's kinder and gentler,
I'm going to ask kinder and gentler than whom? The Republican
Party?''
   In 1992, chimed in Willie Brown, speaker of the California House,
``we will capture the White House and give this nation a kinder and
gentler leader.''
   That crop of Ks and Gs represents only the tip of the cliche. It
covers usage by a handful of political spokesmen since last
Thursday. A check of Associated Press files turned up 140 stories
using the phrase since the Nov. 8 election.
   It has become fodder for TV comics, promising kinder and gentler
one-liners. On Groundhog Day, forecasts were for another six weeks
of a kinder and gentler winter.
   Bush used his own line repeatedly during the presidential
campaign _ startling his strategists one night when he said he'd be
kinder and gentler, and would stop negative campaigning against Gov.
Michael Dukakis. By morning, he had decided otherwise.
   In conversation, trying to remember a man's name, Bush described
him as a kinder and gentler looking fellow.
   In the inaugural address, he declared a mission ``to make kinder
the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.''
   All of this flowed from a passage in his acceptance speech last
Aug. 18 at the Republican National Convention, crafted by campaign
speechwriter Peggy Noonan, who should have signed up for royalties
on use of the line.
   ``The fact is prosperity has a purpose,'' Bush said. ``It is to
allow us to pursue the better angels, to give us time to think and
grow. Prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and
making it concrete by certain acts of goodness. It means helping a
child from an unhappy home learn how to read ... It means teaching
troubled children through your presence that there's such a thing as
reliable love. Some would say it's soft and insufficiently tough to
care about these things. But where is it written that we must act as
if we do not care, as if we are not moved?
   ``Well I am moved,'' he said. ``I want a kinder, gentler nation.''
   That's the line that stuck, outlasting the cryptic thousand
points of light turned on in the same speech.
   But after six months, it might be kinder and gentler to dream up
a new catch phrase.

<HEAD>Employers Find That Crowded Hong Kong Lacks Manpower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The teeming streets and apartment blocks jammed
one against the other suggest the last thing Hong Kong needs is more
people.
   But employers insist they have tens of thousands of jobs
available with no one to fill them. They want the government to
relax strict immigration laws so that foreign laborers can help fuel
the robust economy.
   ``There just aren't enough people to go around,'' said Ian Wade,
chairman of the 78-member Retail Management Association, of the
British colony's 5.7 million population.
   Hong Kong's economy expanded 13.5 percent in 1987 and an
estimated 8 percent last year, sending the unemployment rate
tumbling to a negligible 1.3 percent for the three months ending in
November. Jimmy McGregor, who represents business interests in the
local Legislature, estimates that at least 100,000 more workers are
needed.
   Business leaders say the shortage endangers future growth and
forces up wages, fueling inflation, which neared 8 percent last
year. The government, however, says bringing in foreigners who do
not have special skills would deprive local workers of their fair
share of Hong Kong's economic success and could create numerous
social problems.
   The shortage is felt in virtually every industry, from gritty
construction sites to the plush corridors of the five-star tourist
hotels.
   Employers are taking a wide variety of measures to cope.
   The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, short nearly 300 tellers as the
hectic Lunar New Year holiday approached in early February,
attempted to relieve the strain on its employees by giving away two
Porsche cars in a contest open only to customers who used automatic
banking machines, spokeswoman Fiona-Jane Kennedy said.
   The new Marriott Hotel angered competitors by instituting a
48-hour, five-day work week, instead of the industry standard of six
days.
   Kent Maury, the Marriott marketing director, said the five-day
week was designed to give his hotel a ``competitive edge'' in
attracting staff. ``It's done exactly what we wanted,'' he said,
adding that 3,800 people applied for 1,100 openings.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of Hong Kong manufacturers have established
plants across the border in China's Guangdong province, where wages
are relatively cheap, land is available and labor is abundant.
   The critical construction industry has been particularly hard hit
by the scarcity of labor, with the vast majority of projects failing
to make completion deadlines, according to Gerrit J. de Nys, chief
executive of Shui On (Contractors) Ltd.
   The situation is exacerbated by laborers who are not working as
hard, aware of how valuable a commodity they have become, de Nys
said.
   ``If you yell and shout at them ... they won't even say goodbye.
They'll just walk off the job.''
   Shui On now tends to focus more on public sector projects because
the government seems less likely to demand penalty payments for the
inevitable delays, de Nys said.
   Compounding the personnel headache faced by de Nys and others is
the loss of thousands of key professionals who are emigrating before
China takes over the colony in 1997.
   While there appears to be no quick fix to stem the emigration
flow, businessmen believe the labor shortage could be relieved if
the government relaxed immigration restrictions that generally allow
the entry of only specially skilled workers and maids.
   Nine major business associations have joined forces and are
preparing a report on their labor needs in hopes of persuading the
government to ease up on immigration.
   McGregor, who is involved in the project, said the government
could tap China for labor to do short-term contractual work.
English-speaking workers needed in service industries could be
brought in from the Philippines, Malaysia and possibly Thailand, he
said.
   So far, the government has refused to budge.
   Secretary for Education and Manpower Ron Bridge said in a
November speech that importing workers who do not have special
skills ``would be extremely damaging to our labor relations'' and
reduce the incentive for employers to upgrade technology, management
and productivity.
   Further, he said, the ``supply of housing, medical and social
services and our transport facilities would be stretched even
tighter,'' and Hong Kong could face international accusations of
exploiting cheap labor.

<HEAD>Greek Cypriots Openin a University; Turks Already Have One</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of delay, the Greek Cypriot
community is founding a university in an effort to halt an exodus of
talented students and help reunify the war-divided Mediterranean
island.
   But when the Cyprus University opens next year, it will be
competing for international recognition with a 3-year-old Turkish
Cypriot university also seeking to become a prestigious higher
education center.
   Although Greek and Turkish Cypriot educators say they want
students from both communities, the island's long-running political
problems make that unlikely.
   ``Our university will teach in both Greek and Turkish, and
there'll be a department of Turkish studies,'' the Greek Cypriot
education minister, Andreas Philippou, said in an interview.
   ``We want it to contribute to reuniting Cyprus. We hope Turkish
Cypriots will attend, but it depends on the political situation.''
   Professor Okan Tarhan, head of the East Mediterranean University
at Famagusta in the Turkish Cypriot republic in northern Cyprus,
said: ``We have students from 17 countries but no Greek Cypriots.''
   Cyprus was unofficially partitioned in 1974 when the Turkish army
invaded after an Athens-inspired coup intended to unite the island
with Greece.
   The breakaway Turkish Cypriot statelet was proclaimed in 1983 in
the northern one-third of the island occupied by the Turkish forces.
   Reunification talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on
a United Nation-proposed bi-zonal federation resumed last fall after
a three-year break but have bogged down amid traditional differences.
   Some Greek Cypriot officials fear that the de facto partition of
the island will harden as time goes by, with new generations growing
up on both sides with no contact with each other.
   ``Cyprus is a tiny place, but there's a great hunger for higher
education,'' said Margit Schatzman, an American educational
consultant preparing a study on the Cyprus universities.
   ``Both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot institutions are structuring
their programs along mainstream Western university lines. It's clear
they're both looking for international status,'' she said in a
telephone interview from Milwaukee, Wis.
   Education Minister Philippou, a former mathematics professor at
Patras University in Greece, said the university plan was drawn up
in three months last summer by a group of politicians and Cypriot
academics, including professors at U.S. and British universities.
   ``The decision to have a university was taken almost 20 years ago
but never implemented,'' he said. ``Now it must happen if we're to
stop losing good people who go abroad to study.''
   The Greek Cypriot university is due to open in 1990 in temporary
premises with 400 students and 30 faculty and eventually grow to
4,000 students and 330 faculty members. It is budgeted to cost $42
million.
   The planners say that having a local university will save a large
chunk of an estimated $24 million spent every year on sending 10,000
Cypriots to Greek, British and American universities.
   Many start careers overseas because, with more than 50,000
graduates among the 480,000 Greek Cypriots, jobs at home are hard to
find at home.
   The government offers free business courses to recent graduates
to make them employable in Cyprus' booming service economy, but
``with our own university we can channel people where they're needed
by offering development-related courses,'' Philippou said.
   Young Greek Cypriots say they welcome a university because it
will make Nicosia livelier as well as saving family funds.
   ``The university will bring lots of activities, there'll be more
music and cultural activities. I'm looking forward to it,'' said
Eleanor Palaiologou, who wants to study management.
   The Greek Cypriot Parliament will decide whether some courses
should be taught in English. But with a business school planned,
that may be essential to attract first-rate staff and students,
several educators said.
   The East Mediterranean University, where courses are taught in
English, has a problem because it is in the Turkish Cypriot
republic, which is recognized only by Turkey.
   ``We're an international university, but we don't qualify for aid
from any international organization,'' said Tarhan, the university's
head.
   ``I think that's unfair since we're an educational institution
and not involved in politics.''
   Foreigners from Arab countries, Iran and Pakistan make up around
10 percent of its 2,300 students. The rest are Turks and Turkish
Cypriots, but they also may spend a year taking intensive English
classes before starting as freshmen.
   East Mediterranean, a former junior technical college upgraded to
a university in 1986, focuses on engineering and economics. Tarhan
said a business school will open and more humanities courses will be
offered in the next two years.

<TEXT>
   Rafik Helou, a retired schoolteacher,
hasn't received his state pension for nearly five months. That's
because he's a Christian and lives in east Beirut and the social
security office is in west Beirut, the Moslem sector.
   He is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in long-suffering
Lebanon in which government institutions, including the army, have
been split in two by rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets vying for
power.
   The 64-year-old Helou, who has a heart ailment, has to rely on
his sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife, who suffers
from diabetes.
   The power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition of
Lebanon.
   Many of the country's estimated 4 million people, hardened by 14
years of civil war, have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in their
stride, despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival Shiite
Moslem factions in southern Lebanon.
   But for thousands of people like Helou, it has made the daily
struggle for survival even more difficult.
   State employees are still getting paid.
   Lebanon still has gold reserves worth an estimated $2.5 billion
stored at Fort Knox in Kentucky. But with foreign currency earnings
dwindling, the central bank has turned to internal borrowing from
commercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collect
in taxes, customs duties and other levies.
   But pensioners like Helou have suffered. The social security
department's board of directors has not been able to meet to endorse
pension payments because Christian officials are afraid to cross the
dividing Green Line into west Beirut.
   Helou said in an interview: ``We need 30,000 Lebanese pounds
($60) a month for medicines. I relied on my annual pension of 6
million pounds ($12,000), but with two governments I can't get it.
   ``Fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications for
the time being. But how long can this go on?''
   The crisis began Sept. 22, when President Amin Gemayel's 6-year
term ended without a successor being named.
   Minutes before he stepped down, Gemayel named the commander of
the Christian army, Gen. Michel Aoun, as the head of an interim
military Cabinet until a new president was elected.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem,
and other Moslem leaders refused to acknowledge Aoun.
   The government lost its authority long ago and real political
power has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides and
their foreign allies, such as Syria and Israel.
   Yet government departments handling social and economic matters
continued to function after a fashion, just enough to maintain a
semblance of normality. Now even that slender thread is in jeopardy.
   Ghassan Bitar, a Christian municipal employee, said he and his
colleagues have not been paid since September.
   Bitar, 32, who has two children and a wife five months pregnant,
said he had to turn his family Mercedes-Benz into a taxi to make
ends meet.
   ``I can't leave my family hungry,'' he said.
   Rana Shehab's dreams of going to London to study medicine were
shattered when the Education Ministry refused to issue her high
school graduation certificate.
   ``Going to London's impossible now,'' said Ms. Shehab, an
18-year-old Moslem. ``The only alternative was to enroll in the
American University of Beirut.''
   The university, which once was the most prestigious education
center in the Middle East, is now a shadow of that since its foreign
professors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of its
American and British lecturers and administrators.
   But Ms. Shehab noted: ``It's better than nothing.''
   An Education Ministry official, Sami Hamadi, said the authorities
decided not to issue certificates for students in either west or
east Beirut ``until the government is reunited.''
   Even getting in and out of Lebanon has become a problem for some
people.
   ``Airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport was
renewed in east Beirut,'' said Anis Saeed, a Christian, when he
tried to leave through the airport in west Beirut.
   ``I got my ticket refunded and now I'm going to take the ferry to
Cyprus from the Christian port of Jounieh,'' said Saeed, 24.
   The Lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduous
conditions during the civil war, Israel's invasion in 1982 and
endless factional feuding. But the cloning of what had passed for
their government has exasperated many.
   ``We're fed up,'' said Amal Hamdi, 28, a secretary in west
Beirut. ``We want this chaos to end. However, if formal partitioning
would lead to security, stability and better living conditions, let
it be.''
   ``Let's either have formal partition or elect a new president,
but let's finish and know where we stand,'' said Pierre Ayyoub, 36,
who works at an east Beirut trading company.
   Every government ministry now has two competing heads. The
40,000-man army, the police and municipal departments are similarly
split in two.
   The only institution that has remained intact is the central
bank, which is financing both governments. It is in west Beirut.
   Mohammed Hout, economic adviser to bank governor Edmond Naim,
said the bank's main objectivick pay.
   A recent study by the Swedish Employer's Association said the
average Swedish worker in industry missed 27 days a year for illness
in 1987, compared with 18 days in West Germany, 16 in France and 11
in Britain.
   A recent opinion poll indicated that 86 percent of those
questioned suspected their colleagues of cheating. Official
statistics show that sick pay costs have increased by 50 percent
over the past three years.
   Sweden's sick pay plan has traditionally been based on the honor
system. Under a 1987 reform, blue-collar workers joined other wage
earners in being entitled to 90 percent of their pay when they are
off sick, starting from the first day they stay home.
   The government handles the payments, but most of the money comes
from taxes paid by employers.
   In the Swedish system, an employee who is ill calls his Social
Insurance Office and later signs a form stating the nature of the
illness. A doctor's certificate is required only if the worker is
home for a week or more.
   One form of abuse is simply for an employee to call in sick when
he's not. However, authorities say it's even more common for workers
to file for sick pay and go to work anyway, getting sick pay in
addition to regular pay. It's difficult to check.
   ``If I knock on the door and nobody opens, what is my proof?''
Yvonne Stroberg, a local official, said recently on Swedish
television. She suggested more telephone checks with employers
rather than home visits by inspectors.
   The National Accounting Board described another scheme in a
report late last year. It said some people collect payments for sick
leave, parental leave and student grants for the same period.
   Karl Gustaf Scherer, director of the National Social Insurance
Board, said on television his organization would increase its
supervision.
   In Bandhagen, south of Stockholm, the local office started a
three-week campaign to check all claims on certain days.
   Sick leave, pensions and various other social benefits are
expected to cost 20 percent of the gross national product this year.
   Illness benefits last year amounted to $5 billion, $120 million
more than Sweden paid for defense.
   One option under study is to let employers take over sick
payments for those absent from work up to two weeks, saving the
government money and paperwork. The employer would then claim a
refund from the authorities.
   Unions have opposed the plan. Margareta Svensson at the
blue-collar General Confederation of Unions said it would permit
employers to put pressure on employees.
   ``There would be people who would not dare to be (off) ill if
their employer controlled'' sick payments, she said.
   Since benefits are administered locally, there is no official
overall picture of cheating nationwide.
   A random check by insurance offices in the west coast town of
Halmstad indicated 20 percent of all sick claims were false, and the
figure was 15 percent in neighboring Varberg, Svenska Dagbladet said.
   Another study reported by the Dagens Nyheter newspaper said a
three-day check of claimants in the northern province of Jamtland
showed all 180 cases were valid.
   The National Accounting Board's report said illness claims, valid
or not, varied strongly by location. The 10 districts with the
highest absenteeism were low-income suburbs of Sweden's three
largest cities.
   The head of the Social Insurance Office in Rinkeby, a Stockholm
suburb inhabited mostly by immigrants, topped the list, with an
absentee rate almost twice as high as the national average.
   ``People out here have heavy, monotonous, dangerous and boring
jobs,'' said Gun Britt Johansson, head of Rinkeby's social insurance
office.

   One day last year, state government was within
an hour of not making the payroll. One day in the future, economists
warn, this city could be knocking on bankruptcy's door. Bond ratings
are just one notch above junk bonds.
   Times are hard in Louisiana.
   Charity hospital clinics overflow because the state can't afford
enough doctors to go around. Windows in City Hall remain cracked and
unrepaired. Children go to school in packed classrooms without
modern teaching aids such as computers. One town has to turn off
street lights to save money.
   ``We have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state of
excellence,'' said Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine.
``We've become a welfare state instead of a wealthy state.''
   Times are hard in Louisiana.
   An estimated 30,000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed; some
have been out of work so long their benefits ran out long ago. Many
of the state's skilled workers have fled to healthier regions. In
all, close to 100,000 jobs have been lost.
   Even worse, antiquated laws from bygone boom days handcuff public
officials' efforts to attract new business and raise the money
needed to improve education, health care and the economy.
   French-Cajun optimism, the let-the-good-times-roll attitude that
drank up boom after boom and thirsted through only occasional busts,
seems to be fading. People have been packing up and moving out. No
hope of another oil boom, they say. No hope.
   ``We seem to find people with short fuses lately,'' said Hubert
Chiasson, the manager of New Orleans' largest unemployment office.
``Do I really see any signs of improvement? No, I really don't.''
   Times are hard in Louisiana.
   The state was forced to borrow $1.3 billion to cover its debt,
and another $1.2 billion to bail out its insolvent unemployment
insurance fund. About 10 percent of the state tax collections now go
to pay interest on debt.
   Sales taxes are already highest in the nation _ 9 percent in New
Orleans. Businesses fear that they will be taxed to bail the state
out.
   ``It's a spiral _ you can't get new business, so you can't employ
all the people who need jobs,'' said Tim Ryan, director of business
and economic research at the University of New Orleans. ``That
doesn't mean we will spiral down any further, but there will be no
new growth.''
   In fact, there are indicators that the economy has bottomed out
after two years of depression. There are no signs of improvement,
however.
   The price of oil began its crash in 1984, and two years later a
leading state business organization proclaimed that Louisiana's
recession had become a depression. Unemployment reached 14.5 percent
in January 1987. The latest figure is about 10 percent _ twice the
national average.
   Despite its abundance of resources, waterway location and
reputation for good food and good times, the state proved to be
ill-prepared for the day when the oil ``gravy train'' stopped,
economists said.
   The taxing structure dates back to the days of populist Huey
Long, who believed the people were entitled to a free ride at the
expense of business. Most homes are exempt from property taxes; many
state services are offered at unusually low rates, such as $3 a year
for an automobile license plate.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer tried to rearrange the fiscal structure, but
his first attempt failed in the Legislature last fall. He says he'll
try again, and win, because the future of the state depends on it.
   ``We had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's a
loser. We're trying to reverse it,'' Roemer said.
   The state has a huge group _ estimated at 30,000 _ of out-of-work
oil workers with no employable skills. Most dropped out of school
for the lure of big money on oil rigs. Many don't even have the
money now to pack up and move out.
   ``How are we going to get our present work force into jobs?''
asks Eugene Schreiber, director of New Orleans' World Trade Center
and chairman of a governor's task force on labor. ``We have to train
and develop our workers.''
   New Orleans has seen its sales tax revenue fall so far that the
mayor said the only services left to cut were courts and school
crossing guards. The city has lost $100 million in revenue _ a full
one-third of its entire budget _ since oil prices crashed.
   ``The current budget is in a crisis,'' Mayor Sidney Barthelemy
said in an interview before opting for an $8-per-household ``public
safety fee'' and slashing court funding from $25 million to $15
million, with layoffs in the district attorney's office.
   But Louisiana law says the City Council can't raise property
taxes without a general election, and besides, only 15 percent of
the homeowners in New Orleans pay property taxes, by law.
   The City Council can't raise the sales tax, by law. It can't
create an income tax, by law.
   All Barthelemy says he can do is raise fees, such as slapping a
surcharge on water bills for ``public safety.''
   The city of Shreveport, in the northern part of the state,
balanced its budget by laying off 115 Sanitation Department workers,
abolishing back door garbage pickups and raising water and sewer
rates 25 percent.
   Houma, an oil town near the Gulf of Mexico, found times were so
hard that 3,000 street lights had to be turned off to save money.
   ``Business has never been as bad,'' said Dan Catlett, owner of
the Houma Pawn Shop. ``I can't see any improvement, and I'm usually
the first to tell.''
   New Orleans school Supt. Everett Williams has had to cope with
all the problems of a large, urban school system while his budget
has been slashed. The state cut back on its funding, so did the
federal government, and the city. He's laid off 300 employees. His
teacher-pupil ratio has climbed to 29-to-1 in elementary schools.
His counselor-to-pupil ratio is 450-to-1.
   Voters approved a bond package to help the schools, but it's not
enough. This year, the schools are operating with $30 million in
``bridge funding'' from the state. Williams is worried he'll lose
that money next year.
   That could mean more layoffs, a shorter school year, and a budget
so poor ``I really couldn't operate the school district.''
   Williams, like Mayor Barthelemy, Gov. Roemer, economists and
business leaders, says the key to the future will be reshaping the
tax structure to promote new business and remove the handcuffs from
local governments. Despite the element of futility, they see good
times ahead.
   ``I am optimistic, and I guess that's how we survive,'' Williams
said.
   The governor added, ``We are going to turn this state around.''

   For one week, this jazz 'n' roll city put
aside its problems, polished away its tarnish, set aside its
bickering, dug deep into its threadbare pockets and put on a party
for the Republican National Convention.
   It was a celebration amidst a depression, a $150 million economic
surge in the middle of a financial crisis.
   It was also a symbolic move for ``The Big Easy,'' which now, more
than ever, sees its future in tourism rather than oil.
   ``We saw what happened during the Republican convention. New
Orleans was by far one of the premier cities in America,'' said
Mayor Sidney Barthelemy. ``That gave me a little glimmer of what the
future of New Orleans could be.''
   But the present is one of crisis. The city budget is in such
shambles Barthelemy said he had to cut city funding for the courts
by 40 percent this year. Unemployment remains at nearly 9 percent. A
real estate group labeled New Orleans a place to avoid because of
falling home values.
   And finances at City Hall are so bleak that some worry that New
Orleans may be headed for a crisis similar to New York City's
several years ago _ knocking on bankruptcy's door.
   ``The more likely situation is a default by the city,'' said
economist Tim Ryan of the University of New Orleans. ``But I don't
think that's going to happen. There's a lot of work going on to
avoid that.''
   Part of that effort is a move to overhaul the tax structure for
all of Louisiana, including New Orleans. And part of it is
Barthelemy's push for tourism development.
   New Orleans draws 5 million visitors a year, and that number is
climbing, according to the tourist bureau. Tourism-generated jobs
have grown 38 percent over the last four years, from 37,000 to
51,000.
   The city is doubling the size of its convention center, building
a new aquarium and looking at developing a European-style botanical
garden. Family attractions are needed to offset the adults-only
image of the French Quarter, the mayor said.
   And if it all works, there will be more than enough business to
offset the collapse of the highflying oil industry.
   ``If you ever doubt that, go to Orlando and see what the tourism
has done for that city. Basically, Disney World has attracted
tourists, and money from tourism has developed Orlando. That was
basically the only industry they had,'' Barthelemy said.
   The mayor says the city's financial survival will be on the line
in the state legislature in 1989 when plans to rewrite the state's
tax structure are debated.
   ``When times were good it was a good system because you basically
had oil pay the freight,'' Barthelemy said. ``Now that's changed.''
   ``It's got to be solved,'' he said. ``If it's not solved, then
the city may slip beyond recognition. It's got to be solved. There
is no choice.''

   P.T. Bailey was a partner in an oil field
boat company _ until he almost lost everything. Now he packs crabs
at a brand new fish plant he started.
   ``I was lucky to survive with my pants on,'' he said.
   A lot of people in Morgan City were lucky. While most of the
Louisiana coast has been decimated by the collapse of the oil
industry, Morgan City has been staging something of a rebound.
   Shipyards are hiring again and working two shifts. Fish plants,
such as Bailey's, are teaching unemployed oil workers the ways of
the sea. City employees got back 9 percent of a 15 percent wage cut.
Sales tax collections are $680,000 over projections.
   ``We've had to make do with different things,'' said Mayor Cedric
LaFleur, who has used a $3 million ``rainy day'' fund and profits
from the city-owned utility to spark new businesses.
   For Bailey, the city built a new road so he could build his plant
on a waterway.
   At the Conrad Industries shipyard, employment has increased 100
percent over the last year, said general manager Ronald Chiasson.
The firm, which used to build nothing but oil field boats, has
survived by switching to construction barges, floating dry docks for
South America and even an excursion boat for the Bahamas.
   ``We just weren't willing to give up,'' Chiasson said. ``You have
to go with the flow.''
   At the Wheel House Lounge, on what was once a rough-and-tumble
waterfront area, patrons talk of surviving, not partying.
   ``There's been almost a 100 percent change in character in two
years,'' said John E. Roe, the owner.
   ``If you're going to live down here, you're going to have to know
how to be a survivor. This town survives because these people know
how to survive,'' said patron Peggy Sue Miller.
   At the Morgan City Bank, the marquee recently invoked a popular
song to express the community's sentiment. ``Don't Worry, Be
Happy,'' the sign said.
   But despite the hopeful signs, Morgan City is still wrestling
with the same problems as much of Louisiana.
   Unemployment still runs between 10 and 11 percent. ``But hell,''
LaFleur said, ``it used to be 27 percent.'' The city has lost 1,500
people, but recently gained about 500, LaFleur said.
   That population loss is felt in the city's two major Catholic
churches, which have lost one-sixth of their families, the Rev. John
Gallen of Sacred Heart Church said.
   ``Most of our young people have gone to Atlanta, Jacksonville,
Fla., and places like that where there is employment,'' Gallen said.
   The church has started a thrift store and runs seminars on
business and financial affairs, and depression.
   ``People seem to be cautiously optimistic,'' Gallen said.
``Remember, there are still a lot of people in business just hanging
on.''
   Survivors like Bailey, who now ships Louisiana crabs to Maryland,
say they don't miss the wild days at all.
   ``I've got mixed emotions about what I'm doing. I feel bitter
about how much money I lost, and how I had to start over again,'' he
said.
   And if the price of oil should skyrocket again, Bailey will
resist temptation and stick with fish.
   ``If this business goes, and I think it will, I just don't feel
confident enough in the oil industry to invest any money in it,'' he
said.

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

   When the oil and the good times were flowing,
Louisiana's populist system of government seemed to make sense. Give
the people a free ride and let the businesses pay. Now oil has
crashed, Louisiana has suffered through four years of economic
depression, and economists say recovery isn't possible without a new
system. A reformist governor is trying to do just that, but breaking
with the populist past doesn't come easy. This second of two parts
of ``Bad Times On The Bayou'' explores this Louisiana revolution.

   The 34-story Louisiana state capitol
casts a long shadow over the white marble statue of Huey Long, but
these days, it seems the statue is casting the longer shadow.
   ``An unconquered friend of the poor,'' the inscription on Long's
adjacent tomb says, ``who dreamed of the day when the wealth of the
land would be spread among the people.''
   The populist ideas of ``the Kingfish,'' who governed from
1928-1932, still influence the fiscal structure of the state.
   Spread the wealth, protect the poor.
   Homeowners receive a $75,000 property tax exemption, making the
average home tax free. Automobile license plates cost only $3 a
year. City councils can't raise taxes without a vote of the people.
Businesses bear much of the burden through taxes and fees.
   But the way of doing business that Huey Long helped build is
crippling the state now, economists say. Without the oil windfall,
state and local budgets can't be balanced. Schools and hospitals are
suffering. Unemployment has soared. And new businesses are scared
away by the tax structure.
   ``It's ironic. What is supposed to be good for the people now
acts to their detriment,'' said University of New Orleans economist
Tim Ryan.
   Added business leader Eugene Schreiber, director of New Orleans'
World Trade Center: ``We've got to change. We cannot do business in
the old ways. ... Painful as it is, it's forced us to wake up.''
   But waking up isn't easy in the land of ``The Big Easy,'' as New
Orleans is called.
   After a string of legislative victories and a fierce round of
budget cutting and borrowing, Gov. Buddy Roemer's initial attempt at
overhauling the tax structure failed in the state House.
   The Harvard-educated conservative Democrat has, in his own words,
``poked every bear in the forest'' while inciting a revolution in
Louisiana.
   He won education reform, campaign finance reform, tort reform,
worker's compensation reform, even unemployment insurance reform.
But when it came to fiscal reform, when it came to dismantling the
last vestiges of the populist past, Roemer lost.
   Can't a family's home be the one thing that's not taxed, Roemer's
opponents asked?
   ``I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from Louisiana
tradition,'' Roemer said. ``It doesn't come easy.''
   Along the way, Roemer is also compiling a spectrum of political
enemies ranging from populists to labor unions to teachers. Public
opinion polls are divided on the maverick reformer.
   The question remains, what happens if he can't complete the
revolution?
   ``It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to Saudi Arabia
... a wasteland, a welfare state,'' Roemer said, adding that people
with the means to move away would do so.
   Politicians, he said, ``are beginning to realize that.''
   Fiscal reform has become the vortex of Louisiana's struggle to
climb out of a depression that began when the price of oil fell by
more than half in 1984-85. Tens of thousands lost jobs, and both
businesses and workers left the state.
   And taxes on oil _ which used to account for 40 percent of the
Louisiana state budget _ plummeted. The state, long known for its
big spending ways, hadn't put anything aside for dry years. It
hadn't spent much on developing a strong economic base, outside of
oil. In fact, it hadn't even had a balanced budget in the 1980s
until Roemer took office 10 months ago _ even though it has a
balanced budget law.
   It's debt reached $2 billion.
   ``We could not make the payroll the week after I took office,''
Roemer said.
   Now, state promoters, planners and business leaders all buzz with
talk about Louisiana's recovery _ if there is fiscal reform.
   ``When the price of oil was $40 a barrel, hardly anybody
worried,'' said Schreiber, the businessman who chaired a governor's
task force on labor.
   ``Having all these advantages made everyone in the state very
lazy. Louisiana has not been competitive in business,'' Schreiber
said. ``It's only really now that the state is pulling its act
together.''
   The day after reform failed last October, two companies
considering Louisiana announced plans to build in Texas. Other
businesses considering a relocation or expansion in the Bayou State
are holding off until they see if reform passes, said Louisiana's
chief of economic development, Connie Lewis.
   Wall Street bond brokers set out informal guidelines for what
would be necessary to raise the state's bond rating, currently just
one notch above junk bonds. Low bond ratings means the state must
pay higher interest on its debt. Roemer has accomplished all but one
item _ fiscal reform, said his chief of staff, Steve Cochran.
   ``They watch us very closely,'' he said.
   The battle will probably be waged this spring when Roemer comes
back to the Legislature with a plan. Last time, his package passed
the state Senate, but came up 10 votes short of the necessary
two-thirds margin in the House.
   The opposition focused on Roemer's plan to cut by two-thirds the
$75,000 homestead exemption _ the nation's highest. It was led by a
county tax assessor, Lawrence Chehardy, who saw reform as an attempt
to raise taxes and cripple the average homeowner.
   ``People in Louisiana read horror stories in other states where
property taxes did go wild,'' said Chehardy. ``Government taxes
everything. Can't there be one thing in life a person can have
without being taxed?''
   Chehardy says lawmakers should cut the budget, and if there are
any tax increases, taxpayers should get a chance to vote.
   But Roemer and his top aides insist the budget has been cut so
much _ more than $500 million _ that further reductions could
cripple the state. Already, they worry about the declining quality
of care at state-financed charity hospitals and the ability of
cities like New Orleans to get by without the traditional state
support.
   And the next fiscal year budget has a projected deficit of $734
million. The total budget is $4.2 billion, but only $2.2 billion is
discretionary spending _ money that isn't tied to court orders or
debt payments.
   ``Cutting that much ($734 million) would shut more and more
hospitals, cut transportation money and higher education,'' said
Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine. ``That is, in my mind,
shutting down government.''
   Still, the early talk of next June's budget is a revolutionary
concept by itself in Louisiana, a state that at times balanced its
budget for only three-quarters of the year and hoped oil prices
would go up.

   Since taking office in May, Gov. Buddy Roemer has balanced a
state budget for the first time in the 1980s. He's steered a package
of reforms through the Legislature, including political campaign
reform and education reform. Yet he lost his most important battle _
overhauling the state's populist taxing structure.
   Here, in excerpts from an interview with Associated Press
regional reporter Scott McCartney, Roemer discusses his goals and
concerns for Louisiana from his Baton Rouge, La., office.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Question: What are you trying to do to this state? It seems like
there's a revolution going on.
   Answer: It really is. ... We inherited the highest unemployment
rate in America and a budget that was in shambles for a variety of
reasons. For example, the price of oil in last year's budget was $21
a barrel. Oil never saw $21. It was a phony figure which exasperated
the deficit. We've got it (oil, which is currently around $17 a
barrel) at $13.80. That's how tough we are. ...
   As a result, I think the business community in the state and
outside of the state knows that something's happening in Louisiana.
Our unemployment rate is beginning to go down. It was above 12
percent when I took office. It's now about 9.5.
   Q: Is it the attitudes in the state that you're bumping up
against?
   A: We had a state, and I love Louisiana, but we had a state where
big money beat big ideas, and that's a loser. We're trying to
reverse it. It's not done. We've got a ways to go. We need to
rewrite our tax code to give businesses incentives to grow jobs. I
tried ... I failed by a close margin. We'll try it again, and win it.
   When we do that, all of the ingredients will be in place. ...
Watch us. I want to warn Texas and the other states of the
Southwest. Watch us.
   Q: Is it fair to say what you're really doing is throwing out the
past, throwing out the populist government, throwing out the legacy
of Huey Long?
   A: Right, in part. I want to be fair to Huey because he had many
great points. Huey built the roads in this state to tie farms to
market. He gave children free textbooks. So when we say we're
breaking with the past, I really don't think of Huey Long. I do
think of the populist strain where there's something for nothing and
everybody else pays the bill. We are trying to break from that. ...
I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from Louisiana
tradition. It doesn't come easy.
   Q: What would happen if tax reform doesn't pass?
   A: It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to Saudi Arabia.
We'd be a slave to how many times OPEC can get together and jack the
price around. We'd be a wasteland, a welfare state. Those who are
without hope, those who are without means, won't move _ they can't,
they're stuck. Those with an education, with financial mobility, are
going to vote with their feet. They're going to leave. And for the
first time the politicians are beginning to realize that.
   Every bear in the forest, I've poked. Now is the time to do it.
There are some who think that if I do my job right, I could never
get elected to another public office.
   Q: Do you believe it?
   A: Might be true.
   Q: Do you care?
   A: I don't. ... I would be totally satisfied four years from now
to prop my feet up on the desk and say, `Well done.'
   Q: Do you think things can turn around that quickly?
   A: Yes, in terms of public perception and attitude. That's the
real fight. The fight is not the unemployment rate that goes up and
down with national trends and a lot of things out of our control.
You'll see an improvement over four years and fairly dramatic. But
what needs to turn around is attitude.
   I found many people in this state who had given up, who felt
Louisiana could not change, who felt that we were a slave to our
past, who felt that the populist politicians owned Louisiana.
They're beginning to realize now that we are winners. Not me, we.
This state's a winner.

   When the brothers appeared in Hollywood movies in the '40s,
choreographer Nick Castle thought up ``mad tricks'' for the pair to
do, Harold said. Nick Castle Jr. wrote and directed ``Tap.''
   Most of the tappers had to take other jobs during the lean years,
said Henry Le Tang, 73, who choreographed ``Tap'' and most of
``Black and Blue.'' Honi Coles weathered those years working at the
Apollo Theater. Harold Nicholas spent the '50s working in Europe. Le
Tang, who always loved to teach, opened a tap school when he was 20.
   ``Tap was my love,'' Le Tang said. When its popularity waned, he
choreographed nightclub acts and, for seven years, TV's ``The Gary
Moore Show.''
   Fifteen-year-old Savion Glover, a tap prodigy as were the
Nicholas Brothers, Donald O'Connor and Mickey Rooney, absorbs every
style of tap, Le Tang said.
   ``The older dancers call him `the little sponge,''' hs said. ``As
he keeps getting more spectacular, his own style will start to come
out. It is beginning to happen and will continue to happen.''
   All the older tappers seem to have nicknames. ``I haven't heard
my real name in I don't know when,'' Sims said. Jimmy Slyde, who's
in both ``Tap'' and ``Black and Blue,'' specialized in sliding.
Bunny Briggs, 66, with his saucer eyes and Bambi-like lashes, dances
in both ``Tap'' and ``Black and Blue.'' He got his nickname from his
grandmother because when she'd come home from work, Bunny would
quickly scoot to get her slippers.
   ``I danced as soon as I was born,'' he said. ``When I saw Bill
Robinson dance, I knew I wanted to be a dancer. He sanctioned it.''
Briggs tapped with big bands as a visual addition and an added
rhythm instrument.
   The earliest forms of tap dancing can be found centuries ago in
parts of Africa and Ireland. It was further distilled in the United
States by African slaves and the immigrants who brought their clog
dancing with them to the new world.
   Tap started its current escalation on Broadway in 1971, when
``No, No, Nanette'' was revived. ``Eubie!'' came to Broadway and
Eubie Blake, whose music it comprised wanted Gregory and Maurice
Hines in it, recalling them from the act they had with their father
called Hines, Hines and Dad. The brothers went on to do ``Duke
Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies.''
   Alfonso Riberio originated the title role in ``The Tap Dance
Kid'' and the names of tappers such as Hinton Battle and Gregg Burge
got known around Broadway for that show and ``Sophisticated
Ladies.'' Lee Roy Reams brought Astaire-style tapping to ``42nd
Street.'' Honi Coles won a Tony as best supporting actor in a
musical in ``My One and Only.'' Patti LuPone taps today in the
revival of ``Anything Goes.''
   Upcoming are Broadway musicals in which Tommy Tune works with the
Manhattan Rhythm Kings and one in which Gregory Hines plays,
choreographs and dances as pianist-composer Jelly Roll Morton,
allowing tap to signify music.
   Le Tang is confident that tap will resume its proper position in
the arts.
   In the meantime, the International Tap Association is underway in
Boulder, Colo., giving the dance form an even greater credibility. A
project of the Colorado Dance Festival, the association has started
receiving inquiries from producers looking for tappers.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Mitch Snyder walked away from middle-class
America in 1969, leaving behind a job as a Madison Avenue headhunter
and a wife and two sons to subsist on welfare and food stamps. He
wound up in prison for a while, but for the past 15 years he has
been chipping away at the country's indifference to the plight of
the homeless. Indeed, he has become this country's most influential
champion of the destitute.

   Mitch Snyder remembers cruising up the Bowery
in New York as a boy, car windows tightly closed per his father's
instructions ``to keep out the bums.''
   Robert Snyder abandoned the family when his son was 9. Hurt and
angry, Mitch vowed never to do to his kids what his father had done
to him. A year or so later, his teacher asked him in front of his
Flatbush classmates why his toes poked out the ends of his shoes.
   At that moment, Mitch Snyder divined his future: ``I vowed to be
another Imelda Marcos. I decided then and there I would push real
hard not to have holes in my shoes ever again.''
   America's most influential champion of the homeless has a past
rife with cosmic irony.
   Sixteen years after his father walked out, Snyder quit a
lucrative job as a Madison Avenue headhunter and left his own wife
and two sons to subsist on welfare and food stamps. Twenty years
later, he has just the one pair of boots. Like the jeans he wears
and the food he eats when he's not on one of his well-publicized
hunger strikes, the tan boots are donations.
   So too are the cars he occasionally drives through neighborhoods
most people avoid. The men and women he finds there, sleeping on
heating grates and harvesting meals out of trash cans, often greet
him by name.
   Mitch Snyder never did learn to roll up his windows.
   For the past 15 years, he has dedicated himself to ``liberating
people who are destitute.'' To that end, no one has garnered more
newsprint, forced more hands, or coaxed more cash. But anyone
tempted to pin any medals on him should take heed: Snyder is a
reluctant hero.
   ``I was called by some force outside myself,'' says Snyder, who
has since been forgiven by his family. ``I'm convinced that if I had
a choice, I wouldn't be doing this.''
   It's hard to argue. All told, he has spent two of his 45 years
fasting, and another year sleeping on sidewalks.
   Now, he is embued with new optimism. After 15 years of chipping
away at the national indifference to the homeless, Snyder and others
at the forefront of the struggle may finally be gaining ground.
Recent polls indicate a greater desire to help others. A new
president has arrived. A new decade is coming.
   ``I honestly believe George Bush is a nicer person,'' says
Snyder. ``I believe Ronald Reagan was nice personally, but his
politics were mean- spirited. He was an almost impossible adversary.
Not only was he made of Teflon, but he was made of magic and
charisma. Bush doesn't have that magic, and he has less power to
oppose changes.''
   Snyder's convinced things are changing. ``Listen to the music of
Tracy Chapman, of U2. They are harbingers of a shift in mood.
There's a 30-year cycle: the '30s, the '60s, the '90s. We've just
come through the `Me Decade.' I think people have gotten sick of
living only for themselves.''
   These days, Snyder makes his home in the 1,400-bed shelter on
Second Street, once a University of the District of Columbia
building that the Reagan administration agreed to renovate only
after Snyder embarked on a 51-day hunger strike that melted away 60
pounds in 1984.
   The shelter also is home to other members of the Community for
Creative Non-Violence, a former anti-war group turned advocates for
the homeless. There is no payroll; everyone volunteers.
   Commitment runs high, but this is hardly utopia. Next to sharing
living space with one's compatriots, Snyder says, starvation is easy.
   But like most CCNV acts _ erecting ``Reaganville,'' a tent city
across from the White House, or releasing a hundred cockroaches in
the state dining room _ its communal lifestyle is fraught with
symbolism.
   ``Individualism is pathological,'' Snyder says. ``Our
separateness is what's killing us. Ignorance and fear are products
of distance. That's what enables us to spend a trillion dollars a
year on arms while people sleep in the street.
   ``The issue is how to reduce that distance. Once humanity is seen
and felt, the ability to do damage is reduced.''
   The nation's apathy toward the homeless stems largely from fear,
Snyder thinks. ``They're a reflection of us. We're all vulnerable.
We have to keep the messenger at bay.''
   That isn't to say Americans are uncharitable, he says, but given
a choice, most people are more apt to help victims of earthquakes in
other countries than victims of federal housing policies in their
own.
   Natural disasters, Snyder says, ``do not call into question our
values and our lifestyle. Homelessness does. The obvious answer,
especially in cities teeming with street people, is to render the
homeless invisible.

   ``Two urges are at odds. The urge to create a democracy _ the
urge that made people live in communities and rebuild barns _ and
economics, the urge toward competition and individualism and greed.
One implies charity and generosity. The other says to hell with the
community, create your own niche.
   ``The negative side has become dominant. But the other side nags
at us. We're such a sophisticated, fast-paced society, just getting
through the day is task enough. We have become a frightened,
neurotic people. We drug ourselves to make reality a little softer.
Our families are falling apart. Our schools are breaking down.
   ``We have createdrld.''
   Snyder walked away from middle-class America in 1969, after
waking up one night ``literally in a cold sweat.'' A high school
dropo an unnatural wout who sold washing machines before talking his way
into a
high-paying job as an executive recruiter, Snyder got married and
had two children before he realized he wasn't cut out to be a family
man.
   He set out to find himself and wound up in federal prison on an
auto-theft charge. While serving time at Danbury, Conn., he got to
know Daniel and Patrick Berrigan, in prison for destroying draft
records. Snyder joined the two priests' anti-war group, made up of
prisoneviolent protest, and read a
book a day for 2{ years. After his release in 1972, Snyder joined an
anti-war group in New York, then moved to Washington a year later to
join CCNV.
   In time, he says, ``Homelessness became the domestic counterpart
to what was happening in Southeast Asia. In 1975, the war had ended.
In the house I was living in, we were dealing with evictions of
families. We opened up our living room to people.''
   Over the years, the seam between Snyder's life and his work has
disappeared. ``The deeper you go in, the more you understand the
symbols,'' he says. Identifying and exploiting those symbols _
tearing down fences, both literally and figuratively _ is the key to
CCNV's agenda of civil disobedience.
   ``Our acts are very Old Testament,'' he says. ``We're dealing
with symbols and images. Fasting reminds people that real lives are
at stake. Symbols like fences are very emotionally charged. Property
that exists only to hurt others has no right to exist.''
   Snyder's adversaries have found the hunger strikes particularly
antagonizing, such as his 1978 fast in an attempt to force a wealthy
Catholic church in Washington to contribute to the CCNV shelter
fund. ``It was like having a gun pointed at my head,'' recalls the
Rev. James English.
   English refused, and eventually, close to death, Snyder abandoned
the fast. ``I don't do these things to get people upset, but I have
no qualms about upsetting people,'' Snyder says. ``When people begin
to feel, they begin to think.''
   Within the homeless movement, where nothing remotely approaching
consensus has emerged, Snyder is not without critics. Detractors
have portrayed him as self-serving and publicity-hungry. Some call
him ``Hollywood Mitch.''
   The $5 million it took to renovate the Washington shelter upset
some advocates, including Chris Sprowal, a former hospital workers
union organizer. ``How many houses could you build for that kind of
money? How many people could you put to work with that kind of
money?''
   Snyder acknowledges that overnight shelter is a temporary answer.
``The long-term is adequate housing. The real solution is a society
that's not built on never-ending consumption. But no more shelters
is a barbaric thought.''
   The Hollywood reference sprung from a made-for-TV movie that
glossed over Snyder's abandonment of his family and zeroed in on his
good deeds. That Martin Sheen, who played Mitch, called him ``a
saint'' didn't help.
   Snyder steadfastly refuses to watch the film and squirms when
asked about it. A soft-spoken man who professes to be uncomfortable
in the spotlight, he also has a talent for making the most of it.
The movie, ``Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story,'' added $150,000 to
the movement's war chest.
   Besides, Snyder discovered Hollywood long ago. It was only a
matter of time before Hollywood discovered him.
   ``The three biggest influences on my life were all movies: `Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington,' `It's a Wonderful Life,' and `A Christmas
Carol.'
   ``They taught me the lessons of my life: that good will always
overcome evil, and that the most insignificant person can make a
difference, provided what he's doing is right.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ An Atlanta research center has made significant
contributions to the treatment of disease over the years. But those
breakthroughs have come though experimentation with monkeys and
apes, and that has incensed animal rights activists who frequently
stage protest demonstrations at the center. The director of the
center has received death threats and other staff members say they
fear for their personal safety.

   Tucked into a wooded corner of Emory University's
suburban campus, the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center has
long exuded an air of mystery.
   Security fences and ``Private Property'' signs greet those who
find their way down a winding two-lane road behind Emory dorms and
offices, through the woods, past a secluded lake.
   Here for years white-coated scientists have labored quietly to
find, through study and experimentation with monkeys and apes,
answers to health problems that plague humans.
   But now there's an us-against-them feeling at Yerkes. The
researchers' pride in their accomplishments is tempered by
frustration, anger and even fear. A growing band of crusaders would
like nothing more than to shut the center down.
   ``I wasn't hired to do this, you know,'' grumbles Dr. Frederick
A. King Jr., having to explain to yet another reporter the steps
Yerkes takes to conduct its research as humanely as possible.
   King, an outspoken advocate of animal research and the director
of Yerkes for a decade, has been the target of death threats. His
center, an arm of Emory University and one of seven regional primate
research centers sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, has
been the site of numerous protests by animal rights activists.
   Last December, 12 people were arrested on the Emory campus in a
demonstration against the use of animals in scientific research, the
second such protest in a month. Three of those arrested lowered
themselves on ropes down the front of a six-story building and
unfurled a huge banner reading ``Save the Yerkes Chimps.'' The other
nine tried to block the university's main gate. Members of the
California-based group In Defense of Animals said the protest marked
the beginning of a two-year campaign against centers like Yerkes.
   Elsewhere in the nation, buildings have been burned and animal
rights activists have been arrested with bombs. Yerkes staffers say
they sometimes wonder about their personal safety.
   King says he has ``good reason to believe'' that virtually every
institution like his has been infiltrated by animal-rights activists.
   But his chief worry, King says, is that the animal rights
movement could diminish the effectiveness of the center, a place
where new techniques for treating Parkinson's disease were found,
where ape communication studies led to new ways of teaching retarded
children.
   ``What I am afraid of,'' he says, ``is that these people may get
bills passed in Congress, regulations passed through federal
agencies, that could be terribly, terribly injurious to research,
terribly restrictive and costly beyond belief.
   ``That's my fear, that they will whittle us down _ not that they
will knock us out of the box. By their acts of violence and
terrorism, breaking, entering, bomb threats, destroying property,
stealing animals, falsifying photographs of this and that, they cost
us a hell of a lot of money.''
   The center, named for its founder, Dr. Robert M. Yerkes, a
primate research pioneer, has three locations: the main station,
with labs and offices; a southeast Atlanta language lab, and the
field station, a spartan 117 acres in suburban Gwinnett County where
1,500 primates _ from 1,000 rhesus monkeys to a small family of
pygmy chimpanzees _ live in two dozen separately housed groups.
   Add to that 13 gorillas and a dozen orangutans at Zoo Atlanta
under an unusual and popular arrangement.
   The Zoo Atlanta project, in which primates roam in open-air
approximations of their original habitats, has spurred an ambitious
renovation plan that has brought the once-beleaguered zoo new-found
respect and thousands of new visitors.
   It's also good public relations for Yerkes, as it presents the
center's name to happy zoo visitors gazing at cuddly looking
creatures.
   It's also an ongoing research effort. Yerkes scientists continue
to study the behavior and reproduction of the gorillas and
orangutans at the zoo. In particular, Yerkes staffers and Atlantans
in general hope that Zoo Atlanta mainstay, Willie B., a gorilla who
spent nearly three decades in a cage, will settle down with a Yerkes
female in his new outdoor playground and have little Willies.
   But most of the Yerkes animals are at the field station, a large
site once out in the country, but now rapidly being surrounded by
subdivisions.
   It is there, amid heated concrete shelters and fenced-in pens,
that some 30 research scientists and animal care technicians work
with sooty mangabeys, squirrel monkeys, chimps, and that staple of
research labs, rhesus monkeys.
   On a recent winter's day, field station coordinator and research
professor Tom Gordon, strolled up to a gymnasium-size pen housing
hundreds of rhesus monkeys and started calling them by name.
   ``You get to know them after a while,'' he says.
   Yerkes scientists continually observe the monkeys, looking for
new behavioral characteristics. Even in the largest colonies, one
monkey is king, and a social hierarchy flows downward from him, his
mate and her offspring, with other families acting subservient.
   While some of the rhesus colony are taken from time to time for
lab experiments at the main station, others live on at the field
station for generations in an ongoing behavioral study.
   Another primate group getting a great deal of attention at the
field station these days is a collection of sooty mangabeys who, as
it turns out, are almost universally infected with SIV _ simian
immunodeficiency virus, a close cousin of HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus, the killer virus that causes AIDS.
   Most primates infected with SIV will become ill, as do humans
infected with HIV. But for some reason, the sooty mangabeys, for the
most part, never become clinically ill.

   ``We hope that if we can figure out what the devil provides that
protection, we can contract a vaccine that provides protection,''
Gordon says.
   Around the corner from the mangabeys is a family of pygmy
chimpanzees, part of an ambitious breeding program. The animals
sometimes don't breed easily in captivity, and Yerkes researchers
are proud of their eight pygmy births.
   Across the grounds is a group of full-size chimpanzees, being
watched in a food-and-behavior study and also part of the National
Institutes of Health's five-institution National Chimpanzee Breeding
and Research Program. Researchers figure the animals, so closely
related to man, may be needed someday for AIDS research.
   In the laboratories at the main Yerkes station in Atlanta,
scientists are studying various primates in efforts to combat
Parkinson's disease, eye disorders and even tooth decay.
   The Parkinson's research, King says, is one of the center's
crowning achievements since he arrived as director in 1978. Yerkes
scientists were the first to demonstrate the feasibility of
implanting fetal brain tissue that produces dopamine _ a compound
which acts as a transmitter in the nervous system _ into the brain
of Parkinson's patients as a treatment for the debilitating nerve
disease. Now, doctors in several countries are trying the same
technique in humans.
   ``I consider this one of our major advancements,'' King says.
``We were the first. It's a big step in the right direction.''
   Other achievements at Yerkes in the past 10 years:
   _An anti-inflammatory drug, effective in rhesus monkeys in
stopping the progression of periodontal disease, is now being tested
in human patients at Emory's dental school.
   _Yerkes scientists and Emory ophthalmologists, using primates,
are studying methods of post-surgery treatment for children born
with cataracts. Their work has shown that a traditional technique of
patching the normal eye, forcing the child to use the operated-upon
eye, may be detrimental.
   _Researchers using monkeys, chimps and human volunteers have
found structural and chemical changes in cervical secretions during
the menstrual cycle, which could someday lead to new methods of
birth control or promoting fertility.
   _Language studies in chimpanzees yielded a language system _ with
visual symbols, a computer-operated keyboard and step-by-step
teaching strategies _ that is now being used by cooperating Georgia
State University experts to teach severely retarded children to
communicate. The work was spearheaded by two psychologists from
Yerkes and Georgia State University, Dr. Duane Rumbaugh and his
wife, Dr. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh.
   ``The work of the Rumbaughs must stand very high in the
achievements of this center,'' King says.
   King, a neuroscientist and psychologist, enjoys explaining that
the Rumbaughs were not, at first, looking for a way to help retarded
kids; they were looking at apes.
   ``That began as an attempt to explore some fundamental questions
about the use and capability of great apes to use symbols,'' he
says. ``The important thing is that it started out as a fundamental
scientific project, with nothing in sight in terms of application.''
   He compares the accomplishment to Alexander Fleming's accidental
discovery of penicillin's properties during routine mold studies.
   ``It is that kind of science that has brought us out of medieval
fear and superstition into enlightenment and our ability to deal
more effectively with the world around us,'' King saysd.
   King acknowledges that animals die at Yerkes, but he maintains
they die in the pursuit of what researchers believe is a greater
good. Most people, King says, believe that way, too.
   ``I believe in the sanity of the people of this country,'' he
says. ``This is a utilitarian nation. That utilitarian sense, and
the recognition of what animal contributions have been _ and the
recognition that scientists are not ogres, but care for living
beings other than humans _ I think will lead the nation to recognize
eventually the benefits of science.
   ``This nation will support, and continue to support, life
sciences in general and medical and behavioral sciences in specific,
with primates or whatever other species. I have that confidence.''
   King bristles when asked whether, in retrospect, some experiments
have proven to be unnecessary killing of animals.
   ``Do we have experiments that fail? Of course we do,'' he says.
``It's part of science.
   ``If we knew what was going to happen for sure, we wouldn't do
the experiment! Nobody wants to do stupid, meaningless work.''
   King's stresses in his lectures that animal researchers are not
extremists. The extremists, he insists, are those who would
needlessly butcher and torture animals _ or those who would ban any
scientific use of animals at all.
   ``In all sincerity,'' he says, ``scientists occupy the middle
road of compassion and humane treatment...I don't know any scientist
or institution that doesn't want to reduce that discomfort or pain
to a minimum, but at the same time recognizes that human priorities,
with regard to using animals in research, must come first.''
   King envisions a day when he and Yerkes can put the debate behind
them and get on with their work, and his goals go beyond behavioral
and medical research.
   Without prodding, a discussion of Yerkes quickly turns to King's
two passions: the endangered South American rain forests _ ``without
those, neither the primates nor other species will survive long'' _
and global population control, as man's increasing presence taxes
his planet's resources.
   ``I would like to see us move into the area of population
concerns,'' he says, conceding that for a traditional primate
research center, such work poses ``a difficult question.''
   ```Primate center' doesn't just mean monkeys and apes,'' he said.
``It means humans, too.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ How come newspaper obituaries never say what made
us cry at the funeral and laugh at the wake? With apologies to
Shakespeare, the good STUFF about people is always interred with
their bones. Did they die in a bar fight in the Klondike? Lose a
duel to a jealous husband? Did their parachutes fail to open? Don't
ask the obit.

   Horses, they have track records. Right there in the racing form.
   Won. Lost. Sire. Dam. Purses. Best times.
   People, they just get obituaries. Seventy-five years in the
trenches and the hometown paper kisses people goodbye as if they
spent their lives as assistant purchasing agents for Ajax
Manufacturing Co. after graduating from West Fork High School.
Funeral services 11 a.m. Tuesday.
   Women, they're lucky to make the obit pages at all because all
they ever did was to raise three children, wash the dog after it
chased a skunk and make the beds every morning.
   Where's the meat?
   Shakespeare's Marc Antony says, ``...the good is oft interred
with their bones...''
   No offense, Will, but the good STUFF is ALWAYS interred with
their bones.
   Take the late Col. Fraser Moffat. The alumni magazine of his alma
mater paid due respect to his business and military career. But
nowhere did it mention that well into life he could still balance a
dozen empty beer bottles end on end.
   The father of a colleague gave his own father last rites three
times, unnecessarily as it turned out. Being about 10, he didn't
exactly know procedure so he tried three different versions to
spread-eagle possibilities. Think that stopped any presses? Nope. He
was publicly remembered, albeit justly, for managing restaurants.
   Obits will list survivors, but rarely, unless you're a ruling
monarch, ancestors. There's a happy housewife I met in California
who has survived descent from Jesse and Frank James, the Youngers
AND the Daltons without robbing nary a bank. Not obit material in
spite of what it may tell us about the sins of the father or even
dead cousins.
   In life we are surrounded by ``what ifs'' and other narrow
escapes. Not in death. I had an uncle whose father promised to take
him to the new nickelodeon for his 10th birthday. The morning of the
great event he had sniffles. His mother, a no-nonsense
ex-schoolteacher, wouldn't let him out of the house. That's why he
wasn't sitting in a reserved front row seat when the Iroquois
Theater burned down in Chicago in 1903 killing 602 people. His
escape never made the prints until now.
   So how come obits never say what made us cry at the funeral and
laugh at the wake?
   Alumni magazines are particularly remiss. Most of 'em just say
``deceased.'' But part of the news is how our old pals departed this
realm and what they'd done since we last saw them pouring milk punch
over their heads at senior houseparties. Did they make a
hole-in-one? Win a lottery? Scale K2?
   Did they die in a bar fight in the Klondike? Lose a duel to a
jealous husband? Did their parachutes fail to open? Don't ask the
obit.
   There's a tradition at Princeton University for freshmen to try
and climb up the ivy at Nassau Hall and steal the clapper from the
bell so everyone will have an excuse for not getting to 8 o'clock
class on time. Well, I know a guy who not only got the clapper, he
also found out where they hid all the spare clappers and pinched
them, too. Obit matter? You kidding?
   Last words get dropped from our lives as well. When Henrik Ibsen,
the Norwegian playwright, lay dying, his night nurse told the day
nurse the patient seemed to be slightly better.
   ``Tvertimod,'' gasped the failing Ibsen. In English that says,
``On the contrary.'' Obits never give us a chance to say, ``So
long.''
   To clinch my case I give you Jack Bainton and the cow business.
   Who?
   John William Bainton. Friend. Dead the other day, age 63. ``At
his death Mr. Bainton was...'' That's what the obit said in two
grafs of a large metropolitan daily. OK, that paper's obit page is
harder to get into than heaven, so they may be forgiven for not
getting the rest of the story. But there's no sense waiting around
for Paul Harvey to come up with it.
   John William Bainton was born in Brooklyn. If Brooklyn were an
Oriental bazaar, Mr. Bainton would have ended up selling flying
carpets that turned into 747s. Maybe your sister married the type. A
visionary. Early on.
   Right after World War II there was a restriction on exporting
non-essential vehicles to a war-impoverished world. So Mr. Bainton
whitewashed some station wagons, painted red crosses on them and
shipped them to Brazil as ambulances _until one day there was a
cloudburst in Recife. He assured authorities he would never do it
again, and didn't. But they never found out about the ambulances
that had gone to Turkey where it never rains.
   After selling the idea of centrifuging to the Peruvians to help
make them one of the world's leading fish-meal producers, Mr.
Bainton settled in the Bahamas helping advise one of Canada's
richest men what to do with 3,000 acres he owned, since you can
build just so many resorts and golf courses.
   Build a dairy, said Mr. Bainton, while everyone else laughed
because the land was coral and prickly bushes. Based on his own
research, plus a hunch that defied conventional geology, he claimed
there would be soil underneath the coral. He was right. So what to
do with the coral? Build a rock-crushing plant to extract the lime
to build the cinder-block houses Bahamians live in. Then find cows
that prosper in the semitropics, plant crops and start milking.
   The Bahamas at the time imported 95 percent of its milk from
Miami, so by the time it arrived in the islands, it was already a
day toward sour. Mr. Bainton's dairy eventually was producing almost
as much milk as the Bahamians could drink.
   He later had a business that made bricks out of garbage,
pioneered in embryo implants to improve cattle breeds and proposed
making a massive banana plantation in Oyster Bay, N.Y., under the
world's largest greenhouse, heated by a refuse incinerator. He never
got around to building the power plant he figured would have lit up
all Nassau by producing electricity from the up-welling thermal
currents in the ocean.
   ``Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,'' wrote the poet
Thomas Gray after ruminating in a country graveyard.
   Gray really sounds like he just finished reading an obit page.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Chicagoans go to the polls this week in a special
mayoral election to decide who will serve the last two years of the
second term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first black
mayor. The leading candidates are two blacks hoping to win over
Washington's supporters and the son of the longtime political boss
Richard J. Daley.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ghosts of two former mayors are hovering over
the campaign trail as voters in the nation's third-largest city
decide who will lead them into the 1990s.
   Long gone is the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, a boss of the old
school, who used concentrated political muscle to run Chicago for 21
years before his death in 1976.
   But the front-runner in the special Democratic mayoral primary is
one of his sons, Richard M. Daley, the 46-year-old Cook County
state's attorney whose blood ties to City Hall legend sometimes seem
to transcend his own record.
   Gone as well is Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor,
whose death on Nov. 25, 1987, set the stage for this year's special
election.
   But his legacy of leadership is a key issue for black voters
being wooed by Mayor Eugene Sawyer, 54, Daley's chief primary rival,
and Alderman Timothy Evans, 45, who is running a third-party
campaign on the ``Harold Washington'' ticket.
   At stake in the special mayoral contest are the last two years of
Washington's second term.
   In the Democratic primary, Sawyer and Daley also face Lawrence
Bloom, a white alderman who supported Washington, and two lagging
candidates. Three Republicans _ none well known in this Democratic
stronghold _ were on the GOP ballot.
   After the Feb. 28 primary elections, Evans will take on the
winners in the April 4 general election.
   This campaign season, in a city known for its deep racial
divisions, black voters who united behind Washington are being
ardently courted by Sawyer and Evans.
   Neither can supplant the affable, streetwise Washington, who has
become a symbol of change and unity for many Chicagoans.
   ``Harold Washington...embodied all of the hopes and aspirations
of a generation of people who genuinely believed that Chicago was
ready for reform,'' said Cook County Recorder of Deeds Carol Moseley
Braun, who last fall became the first black to win a major county
office.
   Five weeks before the primary, Sawyer _ elected by the City
Council to succeed Washington _ finally won the endorsement of civil
rights leader and presidential contender Jesse Jackson.
   ``He has done more than any of his primary opponents to sustain
the Harold Washington coalition,'' Jackson said.
   But the delay in that long-awaited endorsement underscores the
discord in the black community since Washington's death.
   And Jackson declined to say where he would stand if Sawyer faced
Evans in the general election.
   Evans, who served as Washington's floor leader in the City
Council, is campaigning as the late mayor's heir apparent. His
withdrawal from the Democratic primary prevented a split in the
black vote that would have virtually guaranteed Daley the nomination.
   Jackson's endorsement was a matter of great concern to both black
candidates, but some observers say it won't help Sawyer.
   A massive black turnout is Sawyer's only chance in the primary,
said Paul Kleppner, author of ``Chicago Divided: The Making of a
Black Mayor'' and director of the Social Science Research Institute
at Northern Illinois University in De Kalb.
   ``My suspicion is that he (Sawyer) is going to get the
overwhelming bulk of the black vote, with moderate turnout _ and
that won't be enough,'' he said.
   Sawyer still has ``the image that he was put in there by the
white aldermen,'' Kleppner said, referring to the role of longtime
Washington foes in engineering Sawyer's election over Evans as
acting mayor in December 1987.
   ``Time heals a lot of wounds,'' counters Joseph Gardner,
Washington's former political office director, who endorsed Sawyer
and predicts a strong black turnout for him.
   The racial breakdown of Chicago's voting-age population on July 1
was about 46.8 percent white, 38.3 percent black and 14.9 percent
Hispanic, said Marie Bousfield, Chicago's city demographer.

   In 1983, black voters turned out in force to support Washington
in the primary, giving him 36 percent of the vote and a stunning
victory over then-Mayor Jane yrne and Daley, who divided the white
vote. Washington went on to a narrow victory in a racially charged
general-election fight against little-known Republican Bernard Epton.
   Kleppner said he believes the racism that marked the 1983 mayoral
contest remains, but ``it's under the rug.''
   Racism was tempered when the city actually had a black mayor, he
said, and many white voters feel Daley is a shoo-in.
   Daley's status as front-runner has not been hurt by virtually
citywide recognition of the family name.
   ``Bring back the Daley dynasty!'' supporters cheer at some
campaign stops.
   Sawyer and Evans _ and Washington _ came up through the ranks of
the ``machine,'' the patronage-rich political organization Daley's
father built.
   Daley says little about his father, whose last years in office
were marred by the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention
and other controversies.
   He cites his own record as county prosecutor and a state senator.
   ``The politics and name-calling are tearing Chicago apart when we
need to work together,'' Daley told a civic club meeting.
   ``I'm not interested in being `the white candidate,' or in
serving as mayor for half the people.''
   Kleppner says Daley will win the primary if he avoids the kind of
slip that could provide a focal point for black opposition. He adds
that such a slip is unlikely since Daley ``has been very well
scripted.''
   Daley kept to that script in a television debate earlier this
month with Sawyer and Bloom. Repeatedly baited by Bloom _ who at one
point said his supporters thought Daley was the ``great white hope''
_ Daley refused to spar.
   City jobs and minority hiring are hot topics and Sawyer, boasting
that a quarter of city contracts are going to minorities, contends
Daley's election would mean moving backward.
   Aides say Daley has a good affirmative action record in his
office, more than doubling the number of black lawyers there in
eight years.
   Activist Lu Palmer said he's not convinced.
   ``No white mayor has ever been sensitive to the needs of our
people,'' he said.
   Daley may benefit from black-Jewish tension lingering after the
furor last spring over tape-recorded lectures by Sawyer aide Steve
Cokely that contained anti-Semitic remarks. Sawyer waited five days
to fire Cokely. A few hours before the announcement, Evans denounced
Cokely's remarks as ``inappropriate.''
   There are many Jews among the white ``lakefront liberals'' who
helped elect Washington.
   ``I don't think that either black mayoral candidate played an
exemplary role in the Cokely affair,'' said Barry Morrison of the
local Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   There have been other tussles.
   Days after becoming mayor, Sawyer faced the disclosure that as an
alderman years before, he accepted what he called a finder's fee of
$30,000 for helping a lawyer obtain a bank loan. In another case, he
admitted filing income tax returns late, though no money was owed
the government.
   Daley, meanwhile, was questioned about a report that petitions
circulated for a failed 1986 referendum to make the mayor's race
non-partisan may have included fraudulent signatures linked to
workers in his office. He cooled the issue by calling for
appointment of a special prosecutor.
   Sawyer says the winner of the Democratic primary is sure to be
mayor, but Evans demonstrated considerable strength when he
submitted more than 100,000 signatures in filing for his third-party
bid _ four times the required number.
   Kleppner suggests it doesn't much matter who wins.
   With the 1991 regularly scheduled mayoral race coming up soon
after this spring's special election, the winner will begin
campaigning immediately, he said.
   ``What this city needs it's not going to get from any of the
candidates,'' Kleppner said, ``and that's long-range planning.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ At age 81, George Romney is a man of remarkable
achievement in both government and business. But he's not done yet.
He's still at work on what he considers his most important
accomplishment, the promotion of volunteer community service, and he
has the ear of President Bush.

<TEXT>
   The dean of Michigan's Republicans
skipped the inaugural ceremony, but his influence was felt as the
presidential mantle was passed from Ronald Reagan to George Bush.
   George Romney, the former governor, former Cabinet member and
one-time auto executive who made an abortive run for the White House
himself two decades ago, decided he didn't want to fight the crowds.
   ``I've been going to inaugurals since Franklin Delano Roosevelt
was inaugurated. I've been to so many,'' the 81-year-old Romney was
saying the other day as he relaxed at his home, looking fit and trim
despite his snow-white hair.
   Romney worked with the Bush transition team to help initiate
Bush's ``Thousand Points of Light'' program and to shape three
volunteer programs which Romney wants to see headed by Peace Corps
Director Loret Ruppe.
   At Romney's urging, Bush announced the three programs during the
campaign.
   Romney puts encouraging volunteer work at the top of his list of
accomplishments.
   ``As a result of my experiences, I've concluded that the most
important thing I can do is to strengthen the whole volunteer aspect
of American life,'' he says.
   More important than reviving the fortunes of American Motors
Corp. in the 1960s?
   More important that spearheading a citizens' effort to streamline
the state constitution in 1961?
   More important than becoming the first Republican to capture the
Michigan governor's chair in 14 years?
   Yes, because to Romney government no longer is the solution to
America's problems.
   ``The most powerful problem-solving force on Earth is the
organized, voluntary cooperation of a free people,'' he says.
   Since 1974, Romney has been founding chairman of Volunteer _ the
National Center, an organization based in Arlington, Va., that is
dedicated to encouraging volunteerism.
   His goal is to create a Volunteer Center in every community that
has a United Way. The centers recruit and place volunteers in local
organizations.
   ``I concluded some years ago we had barely tapped the
problem-solving potential of people helping people, as volunteers,''
says Romney, who created the nation's first United Way in Detroit in
1948. ``I concluded we had organized the money part of volunteering
better than we had organized the people part.''
   Nearly every week finds Romney on the road somewhere, trying to
add to the 350 Volunteer Centers already established.
   On this winter's day, Romney had just returned from an eight-mile
walk, a regimen he follows even on Michigan's coldest days. In the
summer, he adds a round of golf at nearby Bloomfield Hills Country
Club to his exercise routine.
   ``I don't even have arthritis in my little finger,'' he says.
``I've been fortunate, knock on wood.''
   His modern, secluded home is on the edge of a private pond that
is stocked with goldfish and fringed with pine trees. In his study,
he is surrounded by a wall of books, a signed photograph of former
President Gerald Ford, and Time magazine covers bearing his own
picture.
   Romney was born July 8, 1907, in Chihuahua, Mexico, where his
parents and other Mormons had moved to avoid U.S. laws restricting
the practice of polygamy.
   He grew up in Idaho and Salt Lake City, where he met his future
wife, Lenore, while in high school. He was 17 and she was 15. They
were married seven years later.
   Their 57-year marriage has produced four children, 22
grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

   Romney attended four colleges, but never graduated. He spent two
years as a Mormon missionary in England and Scotland, giving
speeches in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park.
   Romney's first exposure to politics was in 1929 as an aide to
Sen. David I. Walsh of Massachusetts in Washington.
   After that were stints at ALCOA and the Aluminum Wares
Association.
   His first job in Detroit came in 1939, when he was local manager
of the Automobile Manufacturers Association. He later became general
manager, but left in 1948 to join AMC, where he eventually became
chairman.
   At AMC, he oversaw the marketing of the first successful compact
economy car on the American market _ the Rambler.
   ``We forced the Big Three into small car production,'' he says.
   The company's stock went from $5 a share to $90 a share with him
at the helm. AMC was purchased by Chrysler Corp. in August 1987.
   ``Lee Iacocca has had to close down plants I used to make
successful,'' Romney says.
   Romney used to rent Milwaukee County Stadium to gather AMC
employees and their families for a meeting.
   ``We'd talk to them about what we were confronted with,'' Romney
recalls, adding that modern corporations and labor unions are guilty
of thinking only of wages and profits.
   Romney's first public service came in 1957, when he headed a
panel to study problems in the Detroit schools.
   In 1959, he created Citizens for Michigan, a bipartisan group
that later spearheaded the drive for a constitutional convention to
rewrite the state's constitution because of a deadlock between the
governor and Legislature.
   Romney's first candidacy was in 1961, when he ran successfully as
a delegate to the constitutional convention.
   ``We were the first state since World War I to rewrite a whole
constitution and have it adopted by a vote of the people,'' he says.
   A year later, he was elected as Michigan's first Republican
governor since 1948.
   Romney's political stock rose rapidly after he won his third term
in 1966. He began to eye a run at the presidency.
   On a September 1967 television interview show, Romney startled
the nation by saying he had originally supported the war in Vietnam
because he had been brainwashed by the military during a tour of the
Southeast Asian country.
   Five months later, shortly before the New Hampshire primary,
Romney withdrew from the race.
   ``It wasn't because of my position on Vietnam or anything I said
about Vietnam,'' he says. ``It was because Nelson Rockefeller became
a candidate and there was no way I could get the nomination fighting
both Rockefeller and Richard Nixon.''
   Nixon later picked Romney to be secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, a post he held from 1969 to 1972, when he resigned to
return to the private sector.
   He returned to politics during the last presidential campaign
when it appeared strife between the forces of Bush, former
television evangelist Pat Robertson and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York
would rip the Michigan GOP party apart.
   ``He was quick to stand up and remind people, publicly and
privately, that there was a bigger fight ahead of us in the fall,''
says Michigan Republican Party Chairman Spencer Abraham.
   Romney found the campaign disappointing, with the candidates
afraid to discuss issues for fear of losing votes.
   ``We no longer have a republic,'' he says. ``We have a special
interest pork-barrel democracy and we haven't adjusted our
institutions to that fact.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Once banned by the Russian czars, the balalaika
is the most beloved musical instrument in the Soviet Union. Now a
Soviet orchestra on a tour of 40 U.S. cities is introducing
Americans to the sound produced by an instrument which is something
like a guitar, but with some big differences.

   There may be some Scots who can't bear the
bagpipe, but it's a rare Russian who bad-mouths the balalaika.
   ``The balalaika is the instrument most close to the Russian
soul,'' says Sergei Lukin, one of the 82 members of the Osipov
Balalaika Orchestra, which is on a tour of 40 American cities
through March 9. ``It is very tender, very touching. It starts
singing in the hands of a real master.''
   What's a balalaika? Well, it's a stringed instrument somewhat
like a guiter, but is triangular shaped, usually has only three
strings, and comes in a variety of sizes.
   Americans may remember the sound from ``Lara's Theme,'' on the
sound track of the film ``Dr. Zhivago.''
   Lukin plays the domra, which looks like a round-bodied banjo, its
flat front the size of a dinner plate. Many balalaikas sound best,
apparently, mixed with complimentary instruments such as the domra.
   Lukin and other members of the Osipov, the Soviet Union's top
balalaika orchestra, were interviewed through an interpreter.
   ``We're doing all kinds of songs _ sad and merry. They all depict
the state of a soul,'' says Nikolai Kalinin, the orchestra's
conductor and artistic director.
   ``There are really rhythmic, energetic songs. You want to dance
when you hear them,'' adds singer Nadja Babkina, founder of the
Babkina Folk Ensemble, which is on tour with the orchestra.
   Miss Babkina, who wears her long hair dramatically forward over
one shoulder, says that in the 16th century, balalaika players were
dispersed and their instruments were burned because they were
thought to be diverting people's attention from the church.
   ``That's why a law was signed by our czar that all these groups
of amateur artists should be destroyed and the instruments also,''
she says. ``Russian people tried to hide these instruments. In the
18th century someone said it was time to renew them.''
   ``Why don't you ask how to play it?'' asks Alexander Gorbachev,
41, holding his wooden balalaika that was made in 1910 by a man
named Nalimov, the Stradivarius of balalaika makers.
   Then he demonstrates, drawing his right index finger across the
strings like a violin bow.
   ``It is such a strong finger, he can even open a bottle,'' says
Sergei Butushin, who plays an array of horns that he has made, some
with bells made of cows' horns.
   ``I go to a place where they kill cows and take quickly their
horns,'' Butushin says. ``We have several such places in Moscow.''
   The balalaika, used mainly for playing folk music, is more
popular in rural areas, but it is not unknown in the cities.
   Vladimir Byeloblotsky, 38, playing some jazz riffs on his bass
balalaika, says he was born in Moscow and heard the balalaika as a
child.
   ``I started playing contrabass, like in the symphony orchestra,''
he says. ``Then I was very fond of jazz and I played in a jazz
orchestra which went away from the Soviet Union and now is in the
United States. Now I'm playing this bass balalaika and I'm really
very happy. I think that is the thing I wanted to do.''
   Gorbachev, who plays ``prima balalaika,'' the main one of the
five sizes of balalaikas in the Osipov orchestra, started on the
accordion, like his father.
   ``I joined music school when I was 15 years old,'' Gorbachev
says. ``I heard balalaika and I liked very much the sound and I
started seriously studying this instrument. I was born in Moscow but
my relatives came from villages.''
   Conductor Kalinin explains that orchestra members and aspiring
members alike must audition each year. Seniority doesn't count. ``If
somebody proves not so good, he retires,'' he says.
   Accordion player Igor Konovalov says, ``I was born in 1941, when
the Germans were very close to Moscow in the Second World War. My
mother went to a village and I was born with an accordion in my
hands. At that time, in villages, it was the most popular
instrument. At night, people came out of their homes and sat on
benches and started playing.
   ``I started playing the gormoyan, which is a purely Russian
accordion, when I was 12.''
   Kalinin, 45, the orchestra conductor for 10 years, was once a
professional singer. His wife plays domra in the orchestra. The
youngest of their three children, now 5, waved his hands like a
conductor _ ``by a kind of inheritance,'' his father says _ before
he could talk.
   Butushin, whose interest in horns crowded out his earlier
balalaika playing, has been in the orchestra for 20 years, since he
was 15, and has been on all its American tours _ in 1969, '71 and
'77.
   Lukin, 31, started out playing the cello as a boy in music school.
   ``I was so small and the cello was so big and heavy, I thought it
was better if I played this domra,'' he says. ``Since then I deeply
love this instrument.''
   ``This domra player is the best in the Soviet Union,'' Kalinin
says. ``He's concert master in the orchestra. He treats his domra
like a beloved woman.''
   Lukin's wife also plays domra in the Osipov orchestra and in the
American concerts they play a duet, which they encore with a Scott
Joplin rag.
   The Osipov Balalaika Orchestra is the Soviet Union's biggest and
best, conductor Kalinin says.
   ``It was founded by Vassily Andreyev in 1919, consisting of eight
players.'' Kalinin says. ``He dressed the balalaika in a tuxedo.''
   Conductor Nikolai Petrovich Osipov later added other instruments
and commissioned composers. After his death in 1946, the orchestra
was named for him.
   The sound caught on outside the Soviet Union, Kalinin adds.
``After Andreyev led a tour, balalaika orchestras were formed in
countries all over the world.'' However, as far as Kalinin knows,
all such ensembles now are in the Soviet Union.

   Bruce Boxleitner has another series in the
works, but in the lull between jobs he's back in the saddle with no
cameras turning.
   ``I'm taking advantage of it to ride and hunt and play the
rodeos,'' says Boxleitner, whose last series was ``Scarecrow and
Mrs. King'' and whose next is a wild comedy adventure called ``The
Road Raiders.''
   In the meantime, Boxleitner stars with Lindsay Wagner and Diahann
Carroll in the two-part NBC miniseries ``From the Dead of Night,''
which will be televised Monday and Tuesday.
   During his time off he's going quail hunting in Georgia and will
enter the cutting horse and team roping contests at the Ben Johnson
Pro-Celebrity Rodeo in Phoenix, Ariz.
   At the presidential inauguration in Washington, Boxleitner was
host of ``A Salute To the First Lady'' at the Kennedy Center and was
a guest for dinner at the home of Vice President Dan Quayle.
   ``I was up on stage in front of the National Symphony and I had
to introduce the conductor, Mstislav Rostropovich,'' he says. ``I
had to keep saying his name over and over again so I'd get it
right.''
   Boxleitner, a Republican in an industry noted for its liberal
activism, says he found Washington to be an exciting place.
   ``You don't have all the phoniness and tinsel you have here,'' he
says, ``and even when you do it's more important. In Washington, the
politicians are the stars. The Hollywood celebrities might get a
tiny mention in the newspaper, which is the way it should be.''
   ``From the Dead of Night'' is the first horror film for
Boxleitner, who's more at home in the saddle. In his first series,
``How the West Was Won,'' which starred James Arness, he played a
fugitive forced to become a gunslinger.
   He co-starred with Kenny Rogers in three ``Gambler'' movies as
Billy Montana, a role he has described as ``an airhead out West.''
He later teamed up again with Arness for a remake of ``Red River.''
   He also starred briefly in the series ``Bring 'Em Back Alive,''
based loosely on animal trapper and adventurer Frank Buck, and most
recently he spent four years co-starring with Kate Jackson in
``Scarecrow and Mrs. King.''
   In ``From the Dead of Night,'' he says, Lindsay Wagner ``carries
the piece. I'm just there to help out. I'm her ex-boyfriend, and
there's a triangle relationship between Lindsay, Robin Thomas and
myself. My character's always out the door when you need him. He's
an anthropologist off to a dig.
   ``But when strange things start happening to Lindsay, I'm the
only one who realizes something really is going on. People all
around her are dying and then coming back as living dead. The
producers don't want us to say zombies. It really isn't a zombie
movie. It's a classic thriller.''
   Boxleitner recently completed the movie-pilot for a new series
for CBS called ``The Road Raiders.'' It's a World War II
comedy-adventure he calls a ``combination of `One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest,' `M-A-S-H,' `The A-Team' and `The Road Warriors.'''
   ``I feel like I'm more a part of this because I helped put it
together,'' he says. ``I play a wonderful character called Charlie
Rhodes. He's Scarecrow and Frank Buck rolled into one. When we first
meet him he's running a saloon in Manila just before the Japanese
invasion.
   ``He's totally unpatriotic. He's out for himself. He's like
Humphrey Bogart in `Casablanca.' He's tough, rough-talking and
always has a cigar stuck in his mouth. People will say I'm doing Don
Johnson. I say I'm doing Clark Gable. Clark Gable in `Boom Town.'''
   Clyde Kusatsu, who was his right-hand man in ``Bring 'Em Back
Alive,'' will be a regular in ``The Road Raiders'' as the villain
and Rhodes' chief rival. ``Clyde and I are really the same guy,''
Boxleitner says. ``We're both con men trying to outdo the other.''
   Boxleitner says he thinks the timing for the series is right
because the third Indiana Jones movie, ``The Last Crusade,'' is due
on Memorial Day.
   ``There's nothing like it on TV today,'' he says. ``I'm so tired
of all these sitcoms. There isn't any comedy adventure on the air. I
think this will fill that need.''

   When Yuriko, a Japanese-American dancer and
choreographer, and her daughter, Susan Kikuchi, met with Jerome
Robbins in January 1988, they didn't realize their conversation
would be the beginning of a year-long project.
   For mother and daughter, it meant a return to ``The King and I,''
a musical both have been associated with much of their professional
lives. For Robbins, it involved the chance to rework and refine one
of his most famous creations, ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas,'' a
production number in ``The King and I.''
   This ballet opens the second act of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,''
a new, $7 million musical featuring numbers by the famed director
and choreographer. The show spans 20 years, beginning with Robbins'
first show, ``On the Town,'' in 1944, and ending with his last
musical, ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' in 1964.
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' required meticulous preparation _
months of research and reconstruction of musical numbers, an
unprecedented 22 weeks of rehearsal for its cast of more than 60
dancers and singers, and seven weeks of preview performances before
the opening.
   The musical also includes such famous Robbins creations as the
frantic Mack Sennett ballet from ``High Button Shoes,'' ``I'm
Flying'' from ``Peter Pan,'' a suite of dances from ``West Side
Story'' and a trio of strippers proclaiming ``You Gotta Have a
Gimmick'' from ``Gypsy.''
   Some musical numbers had to be re-created from scratch and the
collective memories of their original dancers. That wasn't the case
with ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas,'' which is from one of
Rodgers and Hammerstein's best-known musicals.
   Yuriko, a one-time member of the Martha Graham Dance Company,
performed in the original 1951 cast of ``The King and I,'' which
starred Gertrude Lawrence and Yul Brynner.
   In the show, she played Eliza in ``The Small House of Uncle
Thomas.'' The number is a Siamese dance re-telling of Harriet
Beecher Stowe's ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' Now she has helped Robbins
re-create it, and Miss Kikuchi plays the role her mother originated
38 years ago.
   The ballet apparently was Hammerstein's idea. It's mentioned in
an early version of the ``The King and I'' script. The general story
line for the ballet is in the script, as well as some narration and
specific ideas for the dance. Hammerstein even had the idea of using
real dogs _ poodles, in fact _ to chase the ballet's heroine. They
never made it to Robbins' final version.
   Instead, Robbins created six distinct, separate dance segments to
tell the story of Eliza crossing the ice, her pursuit by Simon
Legree, Legree's drowning and the death of Little Eva.
   At first, the choreographer strove for a correct Oriental style.
   ``He was into authenticity, trying to choreograph through that,''
said Yuriko, recalling the intense four-week rehearsal period before
the show went out of town in 1951. The dance style was modified as
rehearsals went on, to accommodate Rodgers' music which was more
Broadway than Far Eastern.
   In rehearsal, Robbins worked closely with Trude Rittman, who
arranged the dance music, incorporating some of Rodgers' melodies as
well as her own work. The music wasn't completed until Feb. 15,
1951, 11 days before the show began its pre-Broadway tryout in New
Haven, Conn.
   ``The music and the choreography went along side by side,''
Yuriko says. ``They were created together.''
   Yuriko remembers the choreography so well because she was the
dance captain for the original production of ``The King and I.''
   ``I had to know all the parts,'' she says. ``In my original music
score, I have notes and have tried to preserve it as much as I can.''
   Yuriko has directed or choreographed many revivals of ``The King
and I,'' including the 1977 Brynner production that ran for more
than a year on Broadway. It was in that revival that Miss Kikuchi
danced the role of Eliza.
   Miss Kikuchi is a veteran of ``The King and I.'' As a child, she
watched her mother in the original production and joined various
revivals of the show herself, eventually playing most of the roles
in ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas.''
   ``My mother would take me into a room and just teach it to me,''
Miss Kikuchi recalls.
   Auditions for the new show began in February of last year. Yuriko
_ and later Miss Kikuchi _ attended them and conferred with Robbins
on his choices.
   ``Jerry took his time picking people, dancers he thought he could
work with,'' says Miss Kikuchi. ``He likes giving new, unexpected
directions and having things accomplished right away.''
   Robbins kept refining the choreography _ at one point, taking out
a major sequence or experimenting with various ideas on how to make
it snow on stage. That effect, used in the original, was finally
dropped.
   Robbins has a reputation as a perfectionist.
   ``You have to be able to have stamina,'' Yuriko says. ``You have
to be absolutely quick in changing from one minute to the next. If
he likes a dancer, he will start to needle a little bit, to see how
quickly they can react to change.''
   The long rehearsal process for the show hasn't been easy. Robbins
quickly replaced dancers if he found they were not working in a
particular number. The show is the bottom line.
   ``He's looking for an intelligence and capability, not just to be
able to do one step, polish it and get stuck there,'' Yuriko says.
``He loves to change until it is right _ and only he knows what is
right.''

   On a continent where kings were once
revered as gods, Asia's half-dozen surviving monarchies include a
diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute
power.
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, the world's longest reigning
monarch following the death Jan. 7 of Japan's Emperor Hirohito, has
initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each
year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design
irrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease.
   Aside from Thailand and Japan, monarchs also reign in Nepal and
Bhutan in the Himalayias, Brunei on Borneo, and Malaysia in
Southeast Asia.
   Unlike his remote predecessors in Nepal, Harvard-educated King
Birendra criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of
fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year
2000.
   In the kingdom of Bhutan, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk pores over
economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions
submitted by subjects.
   Hirohito, whose funeral will be held Feb. 24, is widely credited
with having helped Japan's postwar economic miracle by preserving
national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role.
But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after Japan's
defeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on the
Chrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of Tokyo's Imperial Palace.
   His son and successor, Emperor Akihito, 55, broke with tradition
by marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train,
thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his
fellow Japanese at numerous public functions.
   Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between
emperor and subjects, Akihito is unlikely to interact as intimately
with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asian
royals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power.
   The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaining
hereditary monarchs is Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, an absolute
ruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200
horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the United
States last year named him the world's richest man, with assets
estimated at $25 billion.
   Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister and
defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinet
to help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of Maryland on
the north coast of Borneo island.
   Brunei's sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry and
proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans,
maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of Asia as its
rice fields.
   But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communist
revolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Western
democracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times.
   The last emperor of China abdicated in 1912. Communists ended
imperial rule in Vietnam at the end of World War II. India's
independence from Great Britain in 1947 sounded the knell for
myriads of royals. Cambodia's kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in
1970, though Prince Norodom Sihanouk, formerly the king, is still
active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king of
Afghanistan, Mohammad Zaher Shah, was toppled in 1973 and is exiled
in Italy but recently offered to help in a transitional government
in his country.
   Today, there remain but five Asian hereditary kingdoms and
Malaysia, where every five years one of the country's sultans is
elected a constitutional monarch.
   Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have sultans who are constitutional
heads of the state governments. They have no political power. Every
five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of
themselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each state
gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At the
national level the king is the constitutional head of state but
political power rests with prime minister.
   The present king of Malaysia is Sultan Mahmood Iskandar from
Jahore state. His term expires this year.
   Today's Asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable
futures appear secure.
   Akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600
years in Japan. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors as
figures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world's
oldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favor
its continuation.
   Bhumibol, probably the most respected man in Thailand, is heir to
750 years of monarchy.
   Bolkiah is Brunei's 29th ruler while Nepal and Bhutan both have
centuries-old royal traditions.
   Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king is
regarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held the
country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that
have marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a serious
student-led uprising in 1973 and has in other moments of national
crisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role.
   Named king in 1946 and crowned four years later, when he was a
jazz-loving teen-ager, Bhumibol was initially viewed as someone to
be used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed the
decline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the elite
to work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside.
   Nepal's Birendra, 43, likewise has sought links with the rural
poor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief
supplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgable
sources in Nepal and neighboring India say much of the effort is
negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ an
open secret in Katmandu, the capital.
   Birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16-year
rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited
democratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of the
Hindu god Vishnu, by law cannot be criticized.
   In Bhutan, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old King Jigme Singye
Wangchuk has continued his father's attempts at political evolution
and improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiterate
people.
   ``Development is important but preserving our culture and our
values is equally important,'' Jigme Singye has said.
   Bhutan was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his
reform-minded father.
   International aid agencies have been welcomed to Bhutan but mass
tourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways
upheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like
``kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to four
sisters of noble line, another time-honored custom.
   Brunei's politics are said to be among the most sterile in Asia
but the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significant
signs of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the country
continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medical
care and education are free and the per capita annual income of
$21,000 is among the highest in the world.
   The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and other
investments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and is
credited with a number of civic improvements.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long the butt of jokes as the nation's
``federal village,'' Bonn is suffering further indignities and more
ribbing this year. Its city fathers doggedly insist that this is its
2,000th birthday, and others insist it's not.
   ``Bonn is 2000!'' declare banners hanging from every light
standard flanking the B-9 highway, a flat and colorless corridor
that is the closest thing to a main street in this step-sister
capital destined to be provisional forever.
   Local historians concede that Bonn's founding date of 11 B.C. is
at bestan educated guess on literary grounds and probably a half
century too late if one is talking about when it was settled.
   The first written reference to ``Bonna'' was found in Roman
chronicles of the Rhineland war campaign carried out by Nero
Claudius Drusus Germanicus between 13 B.C. and 9 B.C. Unsure of the
point when Bonn was founded, historians split the difference and
came up with 11 B.C., says Manfred van Rey, the municipal historian.
   ``This is in no way an archeological determination,'' he said in
an interview. ``There is clear evidence that a village of Bonn
existed for several decades before the Drusus reference.''
   Undaunted by details and determined to host a good party, city
officials have embarked on an ambitious yearlong spree of concerts,
exhibits, renovations and a massive fireworks display donated by
China for the occasion.
   The $5.4-million extravaganza, however, has done more to
stimulate the local penchant for self-deprecation than any sense of
historical importance.
   Die Welt, the city's conservative daily newspaper, poked fun at
the historical oversight and questioned the need to lavish public
funds on the belated observance.
   Batches of souvenir mugs, cigarette lighters and other plastic
baubles crowd the check-out counters of newsstands, gathering dust
amid public apathy toward memorabilia attesting ``1989 _ I was
there'' and ``Bonn'' spelled with a red lipstick kiss in place of
the vowel.
   An unassuming hamlet on the Rhine River before its designation 40
years ago as seat of the new postwar government in Germany's Western
sector, Bonn has endured decades of ribbing as Europe's Cinderella
capital.
   ``It is easy to make fun of Bonn,'' the British ambassador, Sir
Julian L. Bullard, wrote in a collection of essays about the 2000th
or so anniversary. ``No one would award it the prize for Best
Theatre, Best Opera, Best Restaurant or Best Newspaper. Best
Intentions, perhaps.''
   Indeed, Bonn has little fame to claim, aside from being the
birthplace in 1770 of composer Ludwig von Beethoven, who left in his
teen-age years.
   Bonn has little business aside from the federal government. A
licorice factory, a pipe-organ works and a family-owned venture that
stitches European flags are the city's most prominent industries.
   With fewer than 300,000 residents, including the nearby towns it
has swallowed over the past few years, Bonn is too small to rate a
store that stays open later than 6:30 p.m. under the government's
complicated commerce rules.
   The small-town atmosphere of Europe's youngest capital has earned
it the nickname ``Bundesdorf,'' or federal village, a play on its
designation as Bundeshauptstadt _ federal capital.
   It was Bonn's very obscurity that earned it the dubious role of
provisional capital in 1949 _ a verifiable anniversary that will be
celebrated nationwide this spring.
   Following four years of Allied control after World War II, the
West German government created in 1949 was intent on eventual
reunification with the Soviet-controlled East German sector and did
not want a prominent capital in an established city like Frankfurt,
Hamburg or Munich.
   A picturesque village just south of Cologne and a favorite summer
stopover for the man who was to become the first chancellor, Konrad
Adenauer, Bonn was tabbed as a sufficiently low-profile spot from
which to tide over affairs of state until Berlin, the real capital,
could be reclaimed by a unified Germany.
   Despite 40 years and all-but-extinguished hopes for
reunification, Bonn has failed to take on a capital image.
   Reflecting official insistence that life here is temporary,
government ministries occupy box-like concrete quarters that could
easily be converted to private use. Hotel space is scarce.
Embassies, though maintained in the tidy Rhineland tradition, tend
toward the austere and outmoded.
   More renowned for its dreary weather than its political role,
Bonn endures a number of physical oddities that aggravate its
small-time profile.
   The city is shaped something like a Q-Tip, with the university
and a pedestrian shopping area forming the northern puff and a
collage of diplomatic missions and housing compounds clustered at
the south.
   Spanning the three-mile distance in between are the parallel B-9
highway and the railroad tracks, both flanked by a narrow stretch of
federal buildings. The arrangement makes it difficult to walk or
drive more than a city block east or west without encountering a
barrier.
   ``There's something wrong with a capital that has to come to a
halt every six minutes to let the trains roar through,'' joked one
American resident.
   Newcomers to Bonn often complain they feel depressed and groggy,
a condition some psychologists here have termed the ``Rhine
Syndrome'' and attributed to unusually low air pressure along the
river.
   The spy novelist John LeCarre captured Bonn's incongruous mix of
scandal and boredom in his 1968 book ``A Small Town in Germany,''
the tale of international intrigue set at the British Embassy.
   ``Sometimes the fog is a little colder. Then we call it winter,''
quipped LeCarre's fictional diplomat, Peter de Lisle. ``Sometimes
it's warmer, and that's summer. You know what they say about Bonn:
either it rains or the level crossings are down.''

<TEXT>
   Fatuma Issa bore her eighth child in a
concrete shelter on the edge of the desert, accompanied only by a
teen-age midwife she had never met.
   Mrs. Issa, 36 years old, strong and lucky, survived the delivery,
but thousands of other women around the world in circumstances
similar to hers die each day in childbirths or from complications
related to pregnancy.
   The world's poorest nations account for about 90 percent of the
half-million women who die each year in childbirth, from
complications during pregnancy or from illegal abortions.
   International efforts are under way to save womens' lives, but
changes are slow.
   In Northern Europe, 9 or 10 women die out of every 100,000 who
give birth, compared with Niger and other parts of West Africa where
the figure is 700 out of 100,000, according to United Nations
studies.
   And for every woman who dies, at least 10 are permanently
handicapped by a complication during pregnancy or delivery, a United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) study reports.
   For each of the 500,000 women who die, at least two children are
left orphans, says UNICEF, calling the figures ``the statistics of
shame.''
   UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the World Bank and others
have taken steps in the last few years aimed at reducing maternal
mortality rate by half in the next 25 years.
   The problem was forcefully illustrated in 1987 at a conference on
maternal mortality in Nairobi, Kenya, by Dr. Attiya Inayatulla of
Pakistan, when he told other delegates: ``It is intolerable that
thousands of women die alone, in suffering, when they are in the
process of giving life, and that we should do so little to help
them.''
   The day Mrs. Issa gave birth, a second international meeting was
taking place about 50 miles down the road in Niger's capital,
Niamey. The meeting, under the auspices of the World Bank and U.N.
groups, was designed to raise awareness of the problem among
officials in 22 French-speaking African countries and to encourage
them to help women and increase family planning.
   Health ministers were hammered with evidence that women hold the
key to helping African nations struggle out of poverty.
   At the close of the meeting, delegates issued a declaration
calling on African nations to do more to save the lives that are
being squandered.
   Women, the declaration said, are not dying from the natural
dangers of childbirth, but from bad health, ignorance, poverty and
an inferior social status that is beyond the imagination of most
women in the West.
   Every morning for most of the last 19 years, Mrs. Issa has risen
before dawn to walk an hour for a bucket of water for cooking and
washing. There is no water source in her village of helmut-shaped
straw huts. After being fed a meager meal, her children scour for
firewood in the vast expanse of dusty scrubland that supports few
trees.
   Standing before a hip-high trough, she begins pounding millet,
the staple of Niger's diet. In blazing heat and dusty wind, she
pounds the grain for eight hours, first in the morning and again in
the afternoon. She then walks another hour for more water.
   She also plants and maintains a garden, feeds the livestock,
cares for her eight children and elderly family members, cleans the
hut and does what is demanded by her husband. He grows millet a few
months of the year when it rains and spends hours talking with other
men in the village.
   ``How can we ease the burdens that rest on the shoulders of
African mothers,?'' Edward Jaycox, World Bank vice president for
Africa, said at the Niamey conference.``It is a question at the very
heart of the development of Africa.''
   African women work 12 to 16 hours a day, account for an average
of 60 percent of what many nations produce and furnish 80 percent of
what their families eat.
   ``The African mother is the foundation of African society,''
Jaycox said. ``Yet, she is also the most vulnerable member of that
society. When food is in short supply, she is the one who goes
without. When there is no doctor, she is the one who must deal with
the risks associated with frequent pregnancies. ... And when the
national quality of life plummets, she is the first to face the
consequences.''
   Mrs. Issa has experienced some of that. Throughout her childhood
when food was short in the decades of recurring drought, her nine
brothers and her father got first choice. She was lucky to have
grown up at all, given the rate of child deaths in poor countries.
   The death rate for Third World children in their first year of
life is 21 percent higher for girls than boys. Fourteen percent of
girls suffer serious malnutrition, while only 5 percent of the boys
do, a World Health Organization study reports.
   Malnourished girls grow into undernourished women. Two-thirds of
pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia and many
more suffer vitamin deficiencies related to poor diet.

   Bad health leads to problem pregnancies, but few women have
access to medical care. Only 44 percent of Third World women in
labor receive medical care. In many countries, about 80 percent of
all births take place at home. About half the time, these women are
alone, national studies report.
   Niger, like several African countries, has taken preliminary
steps to improve health services for expectant mothers. The aging,
concrete shelter where Mrs. Issa had her baby is one of about 80
maternity centers set up by the government around the nation.
   But in a poor country like Niger, where per capita income hovers
around $260 a year, medical service is rudimentary at best and the
standards of service differ widely.
   Even in the capital, where six multi-purpose complexes offer
prenatal, obstetric and early pediatric care by trained midwives and
health workers, the centers often lack sufficient antibiotics, pain
killers and plasma.
   Rural facilities, frequently lack electricity and running water
and are often more like the center here _ two crude rooms with a few
yellowed cots and an inexperienced midwife the expectant mothers
have never seen before.
   Despite the lack of health care and many dangers, African women
continue to give birth too often, too early and too late.
   Mrs. Issa got married in her teens, like 70 percent of the women
in West Africa but only 7 percent in Europe. She had her first child
at 17.
   African women often produce their first baby around the age of 15
and continue having children every year or two until menopause. Mrs.
Issa says she has had enough.
   ``I'm tired, really tired,'' she said, sitting on a dirty foam
mattress without sheets the day after she gave birth.
   ``I want to take something to stop having babies. My husband may
not want to accept it, but he's not the one who's tired'' she added
in the tribal language Djerma, speaking through a midwife who
translated.
   In rural areas, UNICEF reports, 50 percent of the women who had
their first child before 15 were dead by the age of 50 from causes
linked to the trauma of frequent pregnancies.
   But only about 2 percent of African women have access to modern
birth control or information on family planning. Laws, customs and
religious beliefs stand in the way.
   Until Niger adopted a new birth control law last April, women
needed written permission from their husbands even to visit a family
planning center. In some countries, women need permission from their
spouses to leave a village.
   They cannot vote. They can neither own property nor inherit it.
They cannot decide whom to marry or divorce and they are prohibited
from seeking an education.
   Female literacy in West Africa hovers around 6 percent, compared
to 20 percent for African men and 99 percent for women and men in
North America.
   ``Women have no options,'' said Perdita Huston, spokeswoman for
the London-based International Planned Parenthood. ``She may be
desperately tired and not want another child, but she doesn't want
to disappoint her husband. She has to go on pleasing him.
   ``You can talk about safe motherhood until you are blue in the
face and accomplish nothing until you convince the men.''
   Ms. Huston added, however, that attitudes gradually are changing.
Recurring drought and famine in African countries bordering the
Sahara produced a ``psychological shock'' to African governments,
forcing them to reconsider limiting population growth.
   Chiefs of states and heads of families are realizing they don't
need any more mouths to feed.
   World Bank lending for programs related to women's health and
birth control will triple over the next five to eight years.
   ``We need to put our money where our mouth is,'' said M.J.
Gillette, the World Bank's director of the Africa Country Department.
   ``But there is hope. Since the late 1970s ... there has been a
tremendous reversal of spirit in Africa and a real intellectual
grasp of the situation,'' Gillette said. ``Women are organizing and
they are going to take care of this problem. Governments are
recognizing the link between development and population control and
they are changing policies.
   ``The last obstacle to family planning is the African man and he
is waking up. There are forces loose in African society that he
can't control anymore.''

   ``The Stars We Are'' (Capitol) _ Marc Almond
   
   When was the last time you heard lyrics like these?
   ``I'll be a dragonfly, a butterfly, A secret or a little lie to
test you, A song a verse a lullaby, A symphony...''
   ``In my hands the grains of sand, A thousand million moments of
emotion _ Oh these my dreams are yours.''
   ``I'm a teardrop in a storm, A storm at the end of the world.''
   Set words like these to a rock beat and add strings, trumpets and
other lush instrumentation, backing vocals with plenty of
atmospheric reverb, and an occasional spoken-word passage. What do
you have? Donovan? The Moody Blues? King Crimson?
   No, this is not a lost 1967 recording of early Art Rock. But Marc
Almond and his group, La Magia, exhibit a youthful romanticism that
has been missing from rock since the Flower Power days.
   That's refreshing as a break from the current formulas, a
revitalization of an almost extinct style. And it's reassuring to
know that even in the late '80s a songwriter can refer to himself as
someone ``who is afraid of getting jaded.''
   But youthful romanticism and idealism can lead to youthful
excess, and this record is often both trite and overwrought in its
efforts to achieve poetry. In a song called ``The Very Last Pearl,''
Almond aptly sings, ``Call me romantic, Call me deluded.'' He
concludes another song by drawing out the phrase, ``And I ... a fool
... for love!'' Really, now.
   Amid such excess, however, there are some good songs on this
album. ``Only the Moment'' and ``Tears Run Rings'' in particular
stand out as well-realized pop songs that manage to escape being
overdone. All it takes is a little restraint.

   ``Wall of Pride'' (Columbia) _ Omar and the Howlers
   
   Omar and the Howlers play the kind of loud, rowdy rock 'n' roll
that sounds best late at night in a noisy, crowded bar.
   That doesn't mean you have to invite a bunch of strangers over to
your apartment and throw beer bottles against the wall to enjoy
``Wall of Pride,'' the Texas band's second album. But make no
mistake, it's party music all the way.
   Transferring such bar-band energy to a record is no easy task but
producer Terry Manning, who has worked with blues-rockers Z.Z. Top
and George Thorogood, has a way with this sort of thing.
   The focus is not on the songs, which are good if not overly
distinctive, as much as the sound itself, especially the sandpaper
growl of lead singer Omar, who also plays a raw, scraping guitar.
   He's helped by a strong rhythm section and keyboard player Eric
Scortia, who apparently isn't afraid to occasionally use his elbows
instead of his fingers to pound the piano.
   The album's two cover songs are interesting: a remake of the
Animals' ``We Gotta Get Out of This Place,'' which abandons any
pretense to the subtlety of the original; and a version of Jimmy
Reed's ``Down in Mississippi,'' recorded in an odd, muffled sound
that recalls the great bluesman's loping style.
   The originals, most of which are written or co-written by an
otherwise unidentified K. Dykes, range from the all-out boogie of
``Rattlesnake Shake'' to the rhythm and blues-flavored ``King's
Ransom.''
   That's not a very far range, but these guys don't claim to be
Renaissance men. They're Howlers.

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Musical Carnival for Ex-Band Member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rick Danko's life has been a musical
carnival since The Band played its last waltz at San Francisco's
Winterland in 1976. And the bass player wants all to know that he's
alive and well and has no intention of quitting the business.
   Danko took the low road after the group known loosely as ``Bob
Dylan's backup band,'' and sometimes called by a myriad of other
names _ Levon and the Hawks, the Crackers and the Canadian Squires _
decided that 16 years on the road was enough. They retired as a
group. But not as individuals.
   ``The last 10 years I've been documenting my shows _ every night
that I play,'' said Danko, who recently appeared with ex-Band
keyboardist Garth Hudson on ``Mountain Stage,'' National Public
Radio's upbeat and eclectic music show broadcast from Charleston.
   ``There's Paul Butterfield, Richard Manuel, Levon Helm, Robbie
Robertson ... I've made some of these tapes available,'' he said.
``I have a mail-order company.
   ``I hope people don't think I was retired. I'm too young to
retire. I'm 45.''
   Danko, who lives in Woodstock, N.Y. _ where The Band's legendary
house and recording studio, Big Pink, was located _ has concentrated
on raising three children ages 18 through 21 and playing small clubs.
   ``Music's been good to me. Hopefully, I've been good to it,''
Danko said in an interview before leaving for Charleston. ``I felt
good about it yesterday. I'll likely feel good about it tomorrow. It
beats working.''
   Danko and Hudson, who have played together several times over the
past few months, have not had as high a visibility as Robertson, The
Band's guitarist, and Helm, the group's drummer. Danko also has
performed with Helm and Robertson over the years. He also sang on
Robertson's eponymous LP.
   Robertson released his first solo album last year and had a hit.
Helm has carved out a career in films, appearing in such movies as
``Coal Miner's Daughter'' and ``The Right Stuff.''
   The Band had a brief reunion tour two years ago; it was cut short
by pianist Richard Manuel's suicide. Danko said not to rule out
another reunion attempt despite differences between Helm and
Robertson, both of whom viewed themselves as the group's leader.
   ``Never say never,'' Danko said. ``I didn't speak to Robbie for
while, but it wasn't because of a conflict. We just never ran into
one another.''
   The Band began as rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins' backup crew
in the early 1960s and eventually got the name the Hawks from
touring with him. Hawkins moved to Canada with his drummer, Helm,
where rockabilly was just beginning. But his band soon took flight
with its own distinctive style: a blend of Motown, folk, rock and
country.
   They caught the eye of the folk singer John Hammond who brought
the group to New York's Greenwich Village where Dylan started
playing with them. The Hawks, without Helm, toured with Dylan in
1965-'66 with Mickey Jones on drums. When they returned, they rented
a house in upstate New York, got Helm to come up from the South and
wrote some songs. They collaborated with Dylan on ``Tears of Rage,''
but saved some tunes for their classic first LP, ``Music From Big
Pink.''
   They later recorded such albums as ``The Band'' and ``Stage
Fright,'' and such songs as ``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,''
``The Weight,'' ``Up On Cripple Creek'' and ``Life Is a Carnival.''
   When the Band decided to retire, they did so with a splash. Their
final concert on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 at Winterland, called
``The Last Waltz,'' featured appearances by Dylan, Joni Mitchell,
Van Morrison, Dr. John, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Muddy Waters and
Emmylou Harris and others connected with the Band's career. It
resulted in a documentary directed by Martin Scorcese and a
legendary live album of the same name.
   The Band will be installed in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame on
March 12. Aside from the Arkansas-born Helm, the others were natives
of Canada.
   ``It's a pretty big deal with the Canadians,'' Danko said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Two Titans Consider ``The University''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Oakeshott is 87 years old, lives in a
stone cottage in Dorset, England, and is, in the minds of many, one
of the century's great philosophers.
   A. Bartlett Giamatti, a teacher of Italian, English and
comparative literature, was president of Yale University and is
about to become the commissioner of baseball in April.
   The two men, seemingly so distant in place and circumstance, are
actually close intellectual neighbors. By happy coincidence, each
has just published collections of essays describing their views on
education and the idea of the university.
   Both have fashioned elegantly written defenses of liberal
education and the ideal of the university as a place of civil
conversation; a place where, as Oakeshott puts it, a student may
``come to seek his intellectual fortune'' undistracted by the press
of time or outside worries.
   ``The Voice of Liberal Learning: Michael Oakeshott on Education''
(Yale University Press, $20) was edited by Timothy Fuller, head of
the political science department at Colorado College and a friend
and unabashed admirer of the British philosopher who is professor
emeritus at the London School of Economics.
   Giamatti's ``A Free and Ordered Space: The Real World of the
University'' (W.W. Norton, $19.95) consists of 23 essays, many of
them originally delivered as speeches at commencements or
convocations.
   The Oakeshott collection, in particular, represents a welcome
rescue operation, an opportunity for Americans to discover a major
British philosopher and teacher of enormous wit, charm and modesty.
His essays add a civilizing voice to the current school reform
debate.
   For universities and their supporters, the two collections
couldn't be more timely. Taken together, they represent a forceful
rebuttal to ``The Closing of the American Mind,'' the curmudgeonly
best seller by University of Chicago political scientist Allan Bloom
which charged American higher education with selling out its
intellectual responsibilities to 1960s hooliganism.
   The introductions in both collections leave no doubt that
Oakeshott and Giamatti are aiming straight at such
Bloom-and-doomsayers. Giamatti, for one, blames his academic
colleagues for their silence under siege, and urges them to make
their mission better understood to an increasingly impatient public.
   ``A parent who hungers to know, for instance, why a child's
college experience costs so much or, worse, has seemed so
unsatisfactory or lacking in connectedness with anything in the past
will have heard very little from higher education about its issues
or its problems,'' Giamatti writes.
   ``Small wonder that Allan Bloom's book is a best seller.''
   Oakeshott's essays are more difficult, both intellectually and
for their use of British idiom. The collection includes some of
Oakeshott's least-known works, some of which appeared as much as 40
years ago only in out-of-print journals.
   Over the years, Oakeshott has acquired a small but devoted army
of academtic adherents. He is perhaps best known for his definitive
introduction to Thomas Hobbes' ``Leviathan.'' But his other works,
notably ``Experience and Its Modes,'' and ``Rationalism in
Politics,'' have become bibles for those who have watched with
horror the rise of social science and technocracy on U.S. campuses
at the expense of history and the humanities.
   Oakeshott describes the university as an idea, more than a place
_ a community where scholars, teachers and pupils engage each other
in ceaseless skepticism. Universities are, and must remain,
blessedly ``useless'' beyond the enjoyment of learning they offer
participants.
   His essays, including several in the present collection, also
constitute a powerful defense of political conservatism and have
thus been quoted regularly by columnists such as William F. Buckley.
   Yet Oakeshott himself has always been far more good-natured in
his views than those who have most often invoked his name. Still,
practical-minded Americans often find a number of his beliefs
difficult to swallow.
   For example, he describes the undergraduate as ``not a child, not
a beginner. He has already had his schooling elsewhere, and has
learned enough, morally and intellectually, to take a chance with
himself upon the open sea...'' That description might seem a bit
elitist to some, leaving little room in the modern university for
remediation.
   Further, Oakeshott completely and defiantly rejects utilitarian
justifications for higher education:
   ``The current talk about the `mission' and the `function' of a
university goes rather over my head,'' he writes. ``It assumes that
there is something called `a university,' a contrivance of some
sort, something you could make another of tomorrow if you had enough
money, of which it is sensible to ask, `What is it for?'''
   Or again: ``A university ... has a place in the society to which
it belongs, but that place is not the function of contributing to
some other kind of activity in the society but of being itself and
not another thing.''
   The historian of Oakeshottian bent, for example, practices
history for its own sake, not for its supposed ``lessons'' or other
real or imagined uses. Viewed in purely practical terms, Oakeshott's
scholar doesn't give a hoot about whether his activity is of use,
except insofar as it is interesting to him. He wants to understand
for understanding's sake.
   Giamatti, as a former university president, is far more willing
to explore scholarship's connections with other segments of society.
But his central view of the university as a ``free and open space''
is remarkably compatible with the Oakeshott ideal.
   ``Its essence,'' Giamatti writes, ``is that give-and-take, that
civil conversation in its innumerable forms. When that conversation,
the to-and-fro of ideas, is stymied or foreclosed or frozen, when
the questing for truth is told that it must cease because there is
only one Truth and it is Complete, then the institution in its
essence is chilled and its life threatened.''
   In an essay titled ``The Earthly Use of a Liberal Education,''
Giamatti confronts an all-too-American challenge to higher learning:
   Liberal education ``is all very well, but how does someone make a
living with this joy of learning and pleasure in the pursuit of
learning? What is the earthly use of all this kind of education
later on, in the practical, real world?
   ``These are not trivial questions, though the presuppositions
behind them puzzle me somewhat. I am puzzled, for instance, by the
unexamined assumption that the `real world' is always thought to lie
outside or beyond the realm of education. I am puzzled by those who
think that ideas do not have reality or that knowledge is irrelevant
to the workings of daily life.''
   It's comforting to know that such thoughts still occupy the man
who might adjudicate baseball's balk rule come next Spring.

<HEAD>Washington's Birthday Key Ritual In American Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may seem like just a day off, but next Monday
marks a key ritual for affirming the nation's identity by linking up
to a legend.
   With its ancestor worship and retelling of myths, Washington's
Birthday serves the cultural purpose of instructing the young and
reminding grown-ups about what it is to be an American, social
science experts say.
   ``He was in a way an ideal American, and so in celebrating his
birthday the society celebrates itself. It is important for society
to do that because in this way it reinforces its values,'' said Liah
Greenfeld, an assistant professor of sociology and social studies at
Harvard University.
   ``American identity for the most part begins with Washington,''
said David Kertzer, an anthropology professor at Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine. He is ``the point of reference (for) what it means
to be an American.''
   George Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, but the federal
observance falls on Feb. 20 this year. Some states combine the
holiday with Abraham Lincoln's Feb. 12 birthday and call it
Presidents Day.
   Ancestor worship, is common in the world's cultures, the experts
said.
   Enshrining heroes in myths is a way ``of really providing our own
identity by attaching ourselves to a past that is larger than
life... To do that we have to regularly have some ritual observances
to keep those myths and those heroes alive,'' said Kertzer, author
of the recent ``Ritual, Politics and Power.''
   Even if many Americans see Washington's Birthday as just a chance
for a three-day weekend, it still does its cultural job, said Martha
Ward, professor of anthropology and urban studies at the University
of New Orleans.
   ``A good ritual does not have to have many participants to work,
and they don't have to be enthusiastic,'' she said. ``Have you ever
been to a funeral in which you were secretly cheering?''
   The important thing is that somebody observes the ritual, Ward
said. ``Our personal feelings about this are totally immaterial.
These structures existed before we were born, and they will continue
after we are dead.''
   The holiday is observed more directly in schools, where it
instructs the young, said Richard Peterson, sociology professor at
Vanderbilt University.
   So what does George Washington represent?
   There's honesty, as in the cherry tree confession, and strength,
as in flinging the silver dollar across the Potomac River.
   He also is portrayed as a loving and caring father of the country.
   ``People need fathers. This is a myth about how fathers should
act,'' said Ward, adding that the Valley Forge legend provides a
classic hero myth.
   ``Heroes must go through a time of testing, in which they must
triumph. They have to have followers and they have to have a sort of
vision, even if it's not shared at the time with other people, of
what they're doing.''
   People ``want to know George Washington couldn't get supplies
from the Continental Congress, and isn't that typical? The vision of
great leaders is not shared by the legislature. This is sort of a
basic American myth about what kind of society do we have, and how
did it come into being.''
   Yet Washington is the statesman with the formal wig as well as
the revolutionary leader, said Kertzer. ``You don't think of a
heated personality, sort of a rabble rouser'' like Lenin. By
remembering Washington as a statesman-revolutionary, ``we deal with
the ambiguity of our notion of a nation that was born with
revolution, and yet a nation that is very conservative.''
   For that purpose, he said, ``Washington's perfect.''

<HEAD>Geologists Hindered In Effort To Prevent Natural Disaster Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weeks before Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz
volcano erupted, melting glaciers and unleashing torrents of mud
that buried 25,000 people, geologists drafted a map showing exactly
where the muck would flow.
   The 17,700-foot volcano started spewing ash Sept. 11, 1985.
Scientists gave the map to officials Oct. 7 and urged them to start
emergency preparations. A newspaper published the map a couple days
later. But survivors of the deadly Nov. 13 eruption complained they
weren't warned.
   ``There were no evacuations ordered as a result of the map,''
which also may not have been understood by residents who saw it,
said U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Robert Tilling. ``That
shouldn't have happened. The whole emergency response network failed
and, as a result, thousands died.''
   Time and again geologists have warned of impending disasters or
urged that steps be taken to reduce the death toll in future
catastrophes. Many of these efforts have been ignored because of
politics, economic concerns, uncertainty in their predictions,
communications failures and the very human tendency to avoid
unpleasant realities.
   ``Geophysicists more than once warned builders of the high
seismic activity in northwest Armenia,'' the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda said after the Dec. 7 earthquake that rocked a part
of Soviet Armenia known for centuries for deadly quakes. At least
24,000 people died, entombed in collapsed adobe huts, stone homes
and inadequately reinforced concrete-slab buildings.
   ``It's not enough to assess hazards. Something has to be done
with this information,'' Geological Survey scientist C. Dan Miller
told 200 officials in November when the agency held a ``Geohazards
'88'' symposium in Menlo Park on how science can save lives from
quakes, volcanoes and landslides.
   Earthquakes, landslides, tidal waves, hurricanes, tornadoes,
floods, volcanic eruptions and wildfires killed more than 2.8
million people worldwide in the past 20 years, and caused up to $100
billion in property damage, said a 1987 National Research Council
report.
   ``The impacts of natural hazards are increasing and will continue
to do so unless the world community takes concerted action,'' the
report said, urging a worldwide scientific effort in the 1990s to
reduce the natural disaster toll.
   Many nations lack the money or political and social institutions
capable of acting, said Julia Taft of the Office of U.S. Foreign
Disaster Assistance. ``The greatest human burden from natural
catastrophes falls on the poor, powerless and helpless victims in
the Third World.''

<HEAD>It's OK To Count On Your Fingers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schoolteachers have scolded children for
counting with their fingers for decades, but some researchers say
finger-counting can keep good students good and help not-so-good
students become better.
   Robert Siegler and Dennis Kerkman, Carnegie Mellon University
psychology professors, say their studies show there's nothing wrong
with finger-counting, and teachers probably should show their
students how to do it correctly.
   ``They're going to do it anyway. Every teacher we've talked about
this with has told us that telling children not to use their fingers
doesn't work... We think children are right to do this because if
you don't know the answer very well, then it's better to be right
than to be wrong,'' Siegler said.
   Good students rely on their memories more than not-so-good
students or perfectionists to solve mathh and reading problems,
according to a study of 80 children at an elementary school in
suburban Monroeville.
   When they couldn't remember an answer good students turn to
backup methods, including sounding out words, using a dictionary,
counting up from a number to add or down from a number to subtract _
or using their fingers. Perfectionists used backup methods even when
they could remember the answer, frequently taking longer to solve
problems as a result, Siegler and Kerkman discovered.
   Not-so-good students gave the most incorrect answers, as
expected, but also displayed poor finger-counting skills. Poor
students may do poor work because they are bad at backup strategies,
including finger-counting, Siegler said.
   ``It's inefficient to be wrong, because you don't learn from it.
If you do a problem and generate a wrong answer in arithmetic,
there's nothing much to be learned. All that can happen is that
you're going to connect that wrong answer to a problem, and that
will harm the process of learning the right ones.''

Birthday serves the cultural purpose of instructing the young and
reminding grown-ups about what it is to be an American, social
science experts say.
   ``He was in a way an ideal American, and so in celebrating his
birthday the society celebrates itself. It is important for society
to do that because in this way it reinforces its values,'' said Liah
Greenfeld, an assistant professor of sociology and social studies at
Harvard University.
   ``American identity for the most part begins with Washington,''
said David Kertzer, an anthropology professor at Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine. He is ``the point of reference (for) what it means
to be an American.''
   Ancestor worship, is common in the world's cultures, the experts
said.
   Enshrining heroes in myths is a way ``of really providing our own
identity by attaching ourselves to a past that is larger than
life... To do that we have to regularly have some ritual observances
to keep those myths and those heroes alive,'' said Kertzer, author
of the recent ``Ritual, Politics and Power.''
   So what does George Washington represent? There's honesty (the
cherry tree confession), and strength, (flinging the silver dollar
across the Potomac). He also is portrayed as a loving and caring
father of the country.
   ``People need fathers,'' said Martha Ward, professor of
anthropology and urban studies at the University of New Orleans.
``This is a myth about how fathers should act.''
   Valley Forge provides a classic hero myth, Ward said. ``Heroes
must go through a time of testing, in which they must triumph.''

<HEAD>Jet Propulsion Laboratory Produces Mars Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA scientists have created an animated
three-dimensional movie of Mars, seen from the view of an astronaut
flying at 160,000 mph through the planet's canyons and above its
volcanoes.
   ``Mars the Movie'' lasts about two minutes, and its simulated
flight ranges from three miles to 500 miles above the surface of the
red planet.
   The film ``takes the viewer on a tour through Valles Marineris, a
canyon system near the Martian equator that stretches farther than
the distance from Los Angeles to New York, and over Tharsis Montes,
a series of giant volcanoes more than twice the size of Mount
Everest,'' the space agency said.
   The movie was made by image-processing scientists at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, which runs America's unmanned space
exploration program for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   It uses computer-enhanced images taken by the Viking Orbiter
spacecraft, and was designed to give scientists a more complete view
of Earth's neighbor and to demonstrate improvements in the lab's
ability to render 3-D images.
   Production required 37 days of uninterrupted computer time, or 15
minutes for each of the film's more than 3,500 frames.

<HEAD>Drug Promising For Non-Surgical Treatment Of Enlarged Prostate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug used to combat high blood pressure
shows promise as an alternative to surgery for treating prostate
enlargement that afflicts up to 4 million American men, a scientist
says.
   The prostate gland surrounds the neck of the bladder and the
urethra in men, and manufactures part of the fluid in semen.
   For unknown reasons, it gradually enlarges after age 35; most men
develop symptoms if they live long enough, said Dr. Perinchery
Narayan, chief of urology at the San Francisco Veterans
Administration Medical Center.
   Two million to 4 million men suffer prostate enlargement to the
point that the gland squeezes the urethra to impede urine flow from
the bladder, Narayan said. Symptoms range from frequent urination
and burning sensations to infections, urine retention and
life-threatening kidney failure.
   A preliminary study of 22 men found that four weeks of treatment
with the drug terazosin provided 30 percent to 50 percent
improvement in urine flow, he said. ``It looks like there's enough
relief that our patients can avoid surgery. Whether this is
permanent remains to be seen.''
   Terazosin is used to treat high blood pressure because it relaxes
smooth muscle in blood vessels. Researchers believe it has the same
effect on smooth muscle in the urinary tract, opening the urethra
despite the enlarged prostate. The drug doesn't appear to reduce the
size of the enlarged gland.
   The VA and University of California, San Francisco, plan to try
terazosin on more 50- to 75-year-old men with enlarged prostates.
Other scientists in the nationwide study are at Washington
University Medical Center in St. Louis, the University of
Wisconsin-Madison Hospital, Tulane University Medical Center in New
Orleans, and the University of California, San Diego, Medical
Center.

<HEAD>Veterinarians Provide `Well-Cow Care' Through HMOOOOOOOOOOOOO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dairy cows are getting prepaid medical
care under a University of Illinois program modeled on health
maintenance organizations.
   ``In the past, veterinarians have been thought of as people who
provide individual animal medicine or emergency care,'' said Howard
Whitmore, head of food animal medicine and surgery at the
university's College of Veterinary Medicine. ``But this is a new
program to broaden the use and role of the veterinarian in the
animal industry.''
   For a fixed monthly fee based on herd size, the college provides
all medical services, including hospitalization when needed and
routine biweekly visits university spokesman Larry Bernard called
``well-cow care.''
   The program helps owners keep medical costs under control, allows
the veterinarians to influence cattle management and use a variety
of skills, and also provides veterinary students with valuable
experience.
   ``We study them as they grow and monitor them all the way through
so we raise these animals efficiently, grow them at the right rate,
breed them at the right time, calve them at the right time and
manage for maximum milk production and profit,'' Whitmore said.
``The veterinarian wants to be viewed as a herd health consultant,
not just a person who delivers emergency care.''

<HEAD>Isolation With No Sense of Time Skews Woman's Rhythms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month in the absence of any timepieces
has altered the waking and sleep patterns of an Italian woman who's
spending five months in a cave to simulate the experiences of
astronauts on long voyages.
   Stefania Follini, who entered a 100-square-foot Plexiglas cubicle
in Lost Cave on Jan. 13, has been sleeping 10 hours and staying
awake 20, said Maurizio Montalbini, leader of the U.S.-Italian
research team. Those cycles likely will lengthen more, said
Montalbini, who once spent seven months in a cave.
   Since Jan. 13, the Ancona, Italy, interior designer's only
contact with the outside world has been through a personal computer,
on which she relays results of tests of concentration and brain-wave
activity.
   Her concentration also seems to have sharpened during her first
weeks of isolation, said Montalbini, who chose a cave in the United
States for the tests because he wanted to be close to researchers
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
universities.
   Dr. Jon DeFrance of the University of Texas Medical School in
Houston, said the Follini experiment will help researchers design a
study in which astronauts will go on a mock space voyage to Mars.
NASA is particularly interested in the Italian study because
previous experiments have suggested prolonged isolation weakens the
body's resistance to disease.
   DeFrance's specific interest is in attention disorders. Ms.
Follini periodically attaches electrodes to her head for brain
scans, and she takes tests on a computer that gauge her attention
span.
   Attention span ``may be disrupted in a number of different
ways,'' DeFrance said. ``Each disruption may have its own pattern or
signature. The disruption may be unique. It may be able to pinpoint
what brain pathways are weakened.
   ``We may be able to develop methods for refreshing attention, so
that astronauts can conduct their activities at a high level and
very competently.''

   Beachgoers can bare as much, or as little, as
they dare this summer and still stay in the fashion swim.
   Shapely and scantily-clad models notwithstanding, ``the big news
is more coverage, because the population in general is aging,'' says
Catherine Hansen, merchandise manager for Jantzen swimwear.
   But the trim and the bold can still show off in Gottex's trendy
Viewpoint line or in Darling Rio, a line that is ``definitely more
risque'' than the mainstream, notes designer Barbara Henriquez.
   Jantzen salutes the trend toward a feminine, dignified look:
floral patterns with lower legs, soft shirring, draping and skirts
to cover the hips, thighs and stomach. Dots or stripes provide a
clean, athletic feeling and textures liven up solid colors.
   ``Blue-greens will always be our No. 1 seller, but we're also
seeing a lot of reds and corals and pinks mixed together: they're
very flattering on a lot of skin tones,'' says Hansen.
   Bikinis offer new variety: some skirted, some with a high or
rolled waistband for camouflage; bandeau or underwire tops team
diversity and practicality. Some suits offer a ``power net lining''
for tummy control.
   Dressy, wash-and-wear cover-ups _ perhaps a polyester or cotton
jumpsuit or wrapped jacket matching your swimsuit pattern _ are de
rigueur for that stroll through the ship or hotel lobby.
   Women from 18 to 40 who want to flaunt a ``very high leg and a
lot of rear'' can take the plunge with Darling Rio, sizzling in bold
prints, little flowers, metallics and solid blocks of two or three
colors _ especially red, lime, yellow or peach.
   These bikinis sport a triangle top, bustier or a traditional
bandeau; one-piece suits highlight the shoulders. ``We haven't
gotten to the point of padded shoulders at the beach, although
Europe is doing that,'' notes Henriquez.
   Henriquez says even Midwesterners are buying her racy line _
maybe not for their local beach, but ``they're definitely wearing it
when they're traveling.''
   Lisa Lomas, Viewpoint's designer, favors 1960s' tie-dye looks,
the Mexican and Santa Fe influence and ``a lot of hot colors: red,
orange, yellow, pink.''
   The suits, designed for physically fit women from 16 to 40, are
fun, clean, athletic and sexy _ some with suspenders. But even here,
``the higher leg is not really that strong this summer,'' notes
Lomas.
   Color blocks, if properly shaped and proportioned, also can
``make the person's body look great,'' even if it's less than
perfect, she says.
   Viewpoint's T-shirt bikinis are sold in three pieces. Women
who've had enough sun can pull the ribbed, cotton muscle shirt over
the suit; but wearing the extremely clingy shirt without the bikini
top ``is a European style. The beaches here don't call for that,''
says Lomas.

   After a few seasons of flamboyance, French high
fashion designers are back to basics with softly stated summer and
spring clothes.
   The mood was breezy and feminine in the lines of 20 designers who
unveiled thousands of original outfits in winter previews for
audiences that included movie stars and VIPs.
   The dresses, each costing $10,000 or more, are custom-made for a
mere 3,000 women. Yet they set trends for much of the fashion
industry worldwide.
   There were airy chiffons and silks in a myriad of pastels and
gentle prints, bias cuts, body-hugging sheaths and bustiers,
oversized pants and pleats. Evening wear looked regal with generous
use of embroidery, lace, jewels, and gold and silver applique.
   Italian couture king Valentino made his Paris debut, ruffling
feathers in Rome and dazzling the French couture crowd with a
stunning look that was sweet and sexy, even in prim navy and white.
   Indian themes were dominant. Valentino decorated his evening
jackets with gold and silver elephants, and Per Spook and Christian
Lacroix served up palettes of subtle beiges and creams. Marc Bohan's
new designs included a sari effect done with feathery light silk
draped around the bodice and over the shoulder.
   Yves Saint-Laurent's collection featured slits cut high above the
thigh, deep-cut necklines, and his signature feminized tailoring.
   Except for Saint-Laurent, it was adieu to oversized shoulders,
miniskirts and pouffy ball gowns. The lines were fluid and graceful,
with wispy chiffons and soft crepes for both daytime and after dark.
   Hems, for the most part, skimmed the knee, though many designers
showed the leg with asymmetrical wraparounds and skirts, long and
short, slit from hem to waist.
   Chanel, however, opted for calf-length pleated skirts for daytime
wear, especially good in navy and cream. Worn under long tunic
jackets and with two-tone flats, they had a schoolgirl charm
reminiscent of the 1930s.
   The latest evolution of the classic Chanel jacket showed a longer
cut, fastening with a single button just above the waist; the newest
Chanel buttons were pearl. A major switch was a smooth leather
purse, superseding the chain-handled quilted bag as a Chanel status
symbol.
   For most designers, it was the year of the dress. Givenchy took
the simple shirtwaist classic and dressed it up or down, depending
on the time of day. Pleated or belted, cinched or cravated, dresses
were aimed to appeal to those with conservative tastes who still
like a touch of glamor.
   Pant lovers, thin and not-so-thin, will be comfortable in Spook's
pajama pants worn under layers of vests for day or under colorful
embroidered tunics for after dark.
   Saint-Laurent showed an array of menswear-styled trousers for day
and evening wear. Cut to just above the ankle, they created a long,
slimming line flowing down through high heeled pumps. They were
shown with suit jackets that dipped dramatically or with with
ultra-sheer chiffon blouses.
   Guy Laroche was this year's winner of the Golden Thimble award
for the most beautiful collection with his classy designs in
brilliant colors: sunbursts of yellow, juicy reds and bright oranges
melting into the palest of springy pastels.
   One of his designs was an elegantly simple black sheath that was
high-necked in the front but backless to the waist and circled by
white-edged ruffling.
   Lacroix abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections
and came up with feminine pastels, draping chiffon in flowing
pantskirts and embroidered and bejeweled raw silk. He used lace and
gathered organza for a dreamy, cloudlike effect.
   Lacroix's palette was strong with sandy beiges evoking the
desert, mixing melon and pistachio pastels, poppy reds and Persian
blue, black, white and navy.
   In most of the collections, curves and busts were emphasized with
drapery, belts and buttons. The exception was Lacroix, who covered
them with trapeze and triangular shapes.
   Torrente maintained Parisian chic with daytime dresses of polka
dot pastels with kick pleats topped with bows, striking tiered
dresses, and wide-brimmed hats. For after dark, there were draped
chiffons and crepes, held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or
bows.
   Hanae Mori also toasted femininity with her floor-length yellow
draped sheath, set off by a line of ruffles running from shoulder to
toe.
   Nina Ricci produced a large collection of simple but beautiful
clothes in rich fabrics for all times of day. There were wide soft
pants, pleated and swirling skirts and cinched waists, creating a
nostalgic prettiness.
   For after hours, Ricci served up an understated but elegant long
sleeveless evening gown in peach crepe satin with pleated bodice and
back.

   Emanuel Ungaro has presented a sumptuous collection
for spring and summer, softening his structured look in defiance of
the sweet and pretty trend dominating French haute couture.
   Ungaro all but ignored pleats and wide, breezy pants and
minimized the draping he has used lavishly in earlier shows. He
showed well-defined lines, bold colors and lots of glitter.
   Ungaro also had a bold approach to the flowers that have sprung
up everywhere for spring and summer.
   Mixing colors generously, he played dramatic floral prints on
jackets and tops against small flower prints on the dresses or pants
underneath. In one outfit, a black checked jacket was paired with a
floral-print dress.
   Soft notes included petticoats under flouncy skirts and cinched
waists, and lots of silky fabric.
   There were a few examples of what is becoming the classic soft
look for summer, including a gauzy white floor-length dress with
halter top and draped bodice, set off with a gold medallion and gold
lame at the midriff.
   Jackets, long or short but all with tightly cinched waists, often
were ruffled at the shoulder-top for a swept-up wing effect
reminiscent of royalty. The softness came when the jacket was
removed to reveal a pretty strapless, flowery dress.
   Ungaro used gold and silver extensively, in brocade or weaved
into the fabric.
   Pants were soft and most were tailored with thin legs and worn
under jackets or in pants suits.
   Hemlines were above the knee, but jacket lengths varied from just
below the waist to dress length and beyond.

   While the miniskirt is still a hot item on the
streets of Italy, despite the temperatures, the shop windows are
showing a spring and summer of 1989 that will be long, loose and
romantic.
   The new look for the warmer days ahead, proposed by the top
Italian designers at their ready-to-wear presentations in Milan and
already appearing in Rome's more exclusive shops, is soft and serene.
   Gone is the aggressiveness of a bold hemline, a hugged hip or a
padded shoulder. Instead, the accent is on a rounded silhouette,
with small shoulders, gently tapered waistline and long hemline.
Super-soft fabrics underline the ethereal quality of the new look,
as does the predominance of rose and cream-colored shades.
   Pants, which competed with the mini craze this winter, continue
their popularity for spring and summer. For the most part they are
ample, and often cropped at the calf. After a long absence from the
fashion scene, hip pants are back again.
   Another look from the past is the nautical theme, with
high-waisted sailor pants and sailor-suit collars on crisp white
blouses and jackets. The color here is rigorously navy blue, or navy
and white stripes. Nautical symbols appear in prints and on jewelry.
   After the freedom of the miniskirt, Italian designers are calling
on women to hark back to the discipline of their school days in
prim, perfectly pleated linen suits and dresses with demure white
collars. Topped by a broad-brimmed straw hat, white gloves and flat
shoes, the look oozes innocence.
   Naturally, at night these school girls blossom into blushing
debutantes in diaphanous strapless ballgowns right out of the 1950s.
   There also is the ethnic lure, a purely South Seas summer look
that will appear in the shops later this year. Here sarong skirts,
bandeau bras, and hip pants abound. Gay jungle prints are de
rigueur, as are bold citrus shades. Jewelry is laden with riches
from the sea.
   To go with the general toned-down spring-summer 1989 Italian
look, heels are predominantly flat, hair styles neat and makeup
natural. The simplicity of the clothes is dressed up by heavy gold
and silver jewelry as well as the ethnic beads.
   Spring price tags haven't gone down, but efforts by the designers
to contain the hike and a stronger dollar keep figures only slightly
above last year's price list. By day, an Italian designer
ready-to-wear outfit, made up of skirt blouse and jacket will cost
an average of $2,OOO, while by night prices range from $3,OOO for
the simpler gowns to above $10,000 for the more elaborate
embroidered versions.
   Some tips of where to look for what in your local shops:
   Armani _ the softest daytime suits on the market in breezy silk
tweeds, beautiful beaded jackets, and dreamy debutante gowns in
wispy chiffon.
   Byblos _ the place to go for ethnic lore with tropical wraparound
skirts, bandeau bras and calypso pants.
   Fendi _ perfection of the schoolgirl look with meticulously
pleated linen suits by day embellished by night with lace collars
and floral embroidery.
   Ferre _ the nautical expert of the season with his almost
exclusive preference for navy blue, his new high-waisted sailor suit
trousers, and the profuse use of nautical symbols on prints and
jewelry.
   Krizia _ a young sporty look in daytime jackets and jumpers.
Milan's prettiest evening gown in tea rose silk organza.
   Versace _ The best selection of high waisted pants and skirts.
Nighttime's most seductive spring look in transparent chiffon
blouses.

   Barbara Bush's fashion style is the perfect
match for a no-nonsense Yankee patrician who favors the quiet
elegance of a strand of pearls over eye-popping rhinestones and
sequins.
   ``I'm not going to turn into a glamorous princess,'' Mrs. Bush
remarked last summer. And after eight years of Nancy Reagan's
high-gloss look, conservative New York fashion designers are
breathing a sigh of relief.
   ``She brings a New England classic tradition to the White House
instead of Hollywood glitz,'' said Gerald Brenner, a vice president
of Adele Simpson's salon on Seventh Avenue, where Mrs. Bush has
shopped for years.
   ``She likes simple, uncluttered clothes,'' Brenner said in a
telephone interview. ``I think she's sensational. There's nothing
phony about her. She's a very nice, down-to-earth lady who happens
to be very bright. She always looks good.''
   Canadian-born couturier Arnold Scaasi, who designed most of Mrs.
Bush's wardrobe for inauguration week, says the new first lady
dresses to please herself.
   ``I don't think she's ever going to follow the fad,'' Scaasi said
in a telephone interview from New York. ``She's going to wear what
looks well on her, what suits her.''
   The designers say Mrs. Bush prefers classical, traditional
clothing _ shirtwaist dresses, three-piece suits and the like _ and
likes all bright colors, especially blue. Her dresses cover the
knee, no matter whether hemlines are rising or falling.
   Her trademark is a triple strand of pearls. ``They're fake, and
she'll be the first to tell you that,'' said Brenner.
   ``I think she has very good taste,'' said Scaasi. ``She knows
very much what she likes and what she doesn't like. She feels good
about herself. She's a very warm, very open and very intelligent
woman with a great sense of humor. She approaches dressing that way,
too.''
   The first lady's press secretary, Anna Perez, said Mrs. Bush
declined to discuss her fashion preferences with a reporter.
   ``She likes to look attractive, like most other women, but it's
not a consuming passion in her life,'' Ms. Perez said. ``She'd
rather talk about other things.''
   Bill Blass, another of the first lady's favorite designers,
agrees.
   ``I don't think clothes will be her preoccupation,'' he said
recently. Blass designed the simple, teal-blue wool coat and
collarless, cream-colored wool dress that Mrs. Bush wore to her
husband's swearing-in as president.
   Mrs. Bush, 63, wears a size 12 and laughingly calls herself ``a
full-figured woman.'' She wears the lightest of makeup, eats
heartily, laughs boisterously and enjoys a good joke, often at her
own expense.
   ``What you see with me is what you get,'' she says.
   She recently told reporters that her style is getting some public
applause.
   ``My mail tells me a lot of fat, white-haired, wrinkled ladies
are tickled pink,'' she said. ``They're very sweet. I think it makes
them feel better about themselves. I mean, look at me _ if I can be
a success, so can they.''
   She poked fun at her appearance again during a pre-inaugural
``Salute to the First Lady'' at the Kennedy Center.
   ``Speaking of glamor, I want you to look at me very carefully,''
she told her audience as she opened the jacket of her
Scaasi-designed blue suit.
   ``Please notice the hair, the makeup, designer clothes,'' she
said. ``I want you to watch me all week and remember _ you may never
see it again.''

   Barbara Bush may be deliberately un-fashion conscious, but among
women in her age group, that's fashionable.
   Fashion experts say that women in the 35-65 age range are
independent in choosing their clothing, and they have a lot of
economic clout to exercise that independence. Quality and classic
styles are the common denominators in otherwise diverse choices.
   ``Mrs. Bush isn't necessarily a trend setter, but she is an
example of what the trend is now,'' says Lucille Klein, women's
fashion director at the J.C. Penney department stores. ``This kind
of woman feels secure and self-confident. She knows she's arrived,
professionally or otherwise. She's not struggling, not striving to
impress people.''
   Barbara Mackoff, a Seattle-based psychologist, agrees. Success in
business and community life have relaxed the hold of the ``dress for
success'' dictum. ``It was professional success, achievement and the
security and confidence that follow'' that did it. ``Smart women
have stopped trying to hide their own distinctive attributes.''
   Their attitudes toward fashion are much like those of Mrs. Bush,
Mrs. Klein says. ``The typical American woman is not hung up on
fashion. What she wants is to look nice, to look pretty. And she
wants to be comfortable with the way she looks.''
   She says that these older women are among the biggest customers
in the stores these days. And what they're buying reflects their
concern with details, quality and classic styles that can be worn
for years. ``We're experiencing a return to taste,'' she says.
   ``The majority are not looking for one-year fixes,'' she adds.
   The classics include suits, ``but not what I call the Wall Street
banker suits of a few years ago. The new ones are beautifully cut,
with details like buttons and linings of good quality.''
   Other favorites are updated shirtwaist dresses, with attention to
detail, cut and colors. They also like separates in street and
sportswear that center around basic jackets.
   They like their jewelry to look like the real thing. ``What is
real, or at least what looks real,'' Mrs. Klein says. ``The pieces
are not necessarily smaller, but they are more refined.''

   That the small woman wants more than revised versions of her
taller sister's clothes is attested by her open checkbook at cash
registers.
   The petite lines, whether dresses, suits or sportswear, has
outpaced all other categories of ready-to-wear in sales. Industry
figures for a six-year period show a growth rate of almost twice for
that for the overall misses and sportswear lines.
   Despite estimates that nearly 55 percent of all adult U.S. women
are 5-feet-3 or under, there was a time was the smaller woman was
left with a choice of paying for alterations or just rolling up her
sleeves.
   That has changed. Now, nearly all major apparel manufacturers
have petite lines, and most large stores have departments or
boutiques devoted to the small woman.
   Typically, petite-size styling differs from regular misses sizes
in shorter sleeves, hems and waist lengths. Details are to scale,
too. There will be one or two buttons on a suit jacket instead of
two or three, and the shoulder pads will be lighter and less bulky.
``Little girl'' touches, such as ruffles, bows and puffy sleeves,
are avoided.
   ``The petite woman is looking for excellent design and quality,
and she wants it in the proportion and fit that is right for her,''
said Bernard Olsoff, president of Frederick Atkins Inc., a
merchandising and marketing firm that has been tracking sales for
about 30 department store chains. He said there has been a 143
percent compounded growth rate over six years for petite dresses and
350 percent for petite sportswear. This contrasts with 77 percent
and 82 percent in those categories of misses sizes.
   ``When you're on the small side, you look for tailored, well-made
fashions that don't overwhelm you,'' said Gretchen Elizabeth
Carlson, the current Miss America. ``I like clothing that fits well
at the waist, such as shorter jackets and belted styles.''
   Ms. Carlson, who stands 5-feet-3{, is celebrity representative
for Crafted with Pride in U.S.A. Council, a manufacturers trade
group.

   Here are some shopping pointers to keep in mind if you're
5-feet-4 or less and prefer not to dress like someone's little girl:
   Study your proportions. If you have a long torso and short legs,
choose long skirts and shoes with heels. If you have a short torso
and long legs, then pick something like a long tunic to make the
waist appear longer. The idea is to visually soften and blend the
proportions.
   A key fitting point is at the shoulders. Collars and necklines
shouldn't bunch up. Alterations are simpler for other parts of the
garment if you start with a proportional shoulder fit.
   Choose softer versions of classically tailored suits. The details
should be scaled down, with narrowed lapels and one-button closures.
Jackets cut at hipbone length will look most natural with a smaller
frame.
   Shoulder pads make the waist look smaller by extending the line
of the shoulders, but make sure they're not too big and bulky.
   Horizontal lines will make you look chunky. So avoid square
necklines or horizontal stripes or seams. By contrast, verticals _
V-necks, vertical stripes and seams _ will smooth and narrow your
lines.
   Let color help, too. Monochromatic colors will help you maintain
an unbroken visual line. You could match hosiery and pumps to solid
colors in pants or skirts.
   Keep your accessories in proportion. Pass up wide belts and
overlarge handbags (use your briefcase to transport extra items).
Shoes with medium heels will look best; avoid the extremes of
stilletos or flats.
   Avoid fussy or cute touches, like Peter Pan collars, puffed
sleeves, big bows or ruffles, or extravagant costume jewelry.
   Stand up and be confident. Good posture and self-assurance has a
lot to do with how well you look in your clothes.
   (The tips come from the Crafted with Pride in U.S.A. Council
Inc., which represents about 400 manufacturers.)

   The sun may be great for tomatoes, but it could be tough on your
face.
   Even the most skilled makeup job can't rescue a complexion dulled
and damaged by overexposure.
   Anyone who spends a good deal of time outdoors, whether in
recreation or work, should be vigilant. The American Cancer Society
says that no one is really free from risk. Most at risk are
fair-skinned people who burn easily, but anyone can be affected.
   Especially during warm weather months, ``making under'' is as
important as making up. For both beauty and safety, it will help you
look cool, fashionable, and healthy.
   Making under can mean two things: Use protective sunscreens and
lubricants before applying foundation, and apply your makeup with a
light hand, choosing soft colors and textures.
   The type of sunscreen you use depends on your preference, but you
may find a moisturizer-based cream most convenient in making up.
Most of these products contain PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) and are
labeled with SPF (sun protection formula) ratings. Choose one that
has a rating of 15 SPF or higher. Don`t forget to use a sunscreen on
your arms, legs, neck, or any other skin area bared during the
summer, especially if you're outdoors between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.
   From a fashion point of view, the no-makeup look is the best
makeup. This season's cosmetics lines feature light colors and
textures designed to blend with the fluid, feminine clothing women
are finding in stores.
   Matte foundations in sheer, delicate shades ranging from
pink-tinged pastels to soft tawnies have been designed to play up
rather than hide natural coloring. Unless your skin is very dry,
finish the base with a light dusting of translucent powder.
   Choose similar light shades for eyes. Single eyeshadow colors can
be found in muted heather and floral shades. Finish with a light
brushing of blush colors in soft matte colors, coupled with frosted
highlight shades blended at the tops of your cheekbones. Compacts
with both base and highlight blushes can be found to make this
combination easy.
   Even lip colors come muted and in matte finishes. Frosted,
pearlized colors can be added for evening wear or can be used alone
for a fresh natural effect during the day.

   Times _ and designs _ have changed since Dorothy Parker warned
that men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses.
   The Optical Manufacturers Association says there were 63 million
pair of eyeglasses sold in the United States in 1987.
   Nowadays, the hotter the sunglasses, the cooler the look.
   Clothes designer Giorgio Armani, for example, now markets some 40
models of men's and women's prescription eyewear and sunglasses,
under the Giorgio Armani Occhiali label.
   His glasses compete with those carrying the names of other
clothes designers, Halston, Givenchy, Ralph Lauren, Anne Klein and
Perry Ellis, as well as celebrities from actress Sophia Loren to
model Cheryl Tiegs.
   Though fashion and design are important, eye protection should
also be considered when shopping for sunglasses, says the American
Optometric Association.
   When buying sunglasses, the association says, make sure they're
impact-resistant, even ``industrial strength'' for the active wearer.
   Dark lenses are recommended by the group, which says sunglasses
should screen out 75 to 90 percent of the sunlight. If the eyes can
be seen clearly through the lenses, they're probably not dark enough.
   The eyeglass frames should be large enough to keep sunlight from
reaching the eyes, but the temple pieces should not block side
vision, the association advises.

   It's no longer enough that jeans just fit _ and last.
   Manufacturers now promote jeans that have been acid-washed,
white-washed, stone-washed, rinsed, bleached, or over-dyed.
   Last spring's favored look was acid-washed. This spring, says Roy
Schiefner, manager of product development for jeans manufacturer
Levi Strauss, ``light-colored, lived-in denim'' will be popular.
   He says the style may also turn to narrower, slimmed-down styles,
which translates as tighter-fitting.

   Like other active-sports gear, the body-hugging costumes worn by
dancers, swimmers and bikers have been appropriated as fashionable
streetwear for teens and near-teens.
   The old reasons for skintight outfits in sports and dance are
free movement and to cut down wind or water resistance. A new reason
might be that, coupled with brilliant colors, the new clothes flaunt
a trim figure.
   Designer Bonnie August couples a short, loose graffiti T-shirt
with second-skin bike pants, both done up with flashy neon colors.
She also uses leotards, tank suits, crop tops, and stirrup tights in
combinations of cotton blends, spandex, and shiny ribbed synthetics.

   Rock stars and fans need their designer lines just like any other
upwardly mobile strivers.
   Somewhat ambiguously billed as ``designers of rock 'n' roll
street fashion,'' a firm called Lip Service now brings rock star
fashion to off-the-rack customers.
   A favorite motif of designer-founder Drew Bernstein is the skull
and dagger, which is featured on Lip Service T-shirts, jackets,
leggings, and, yes, panties _ the kind worn on the outside for
decoration.
   A bold ``War?'' poster-type print also shows up on jackets, and
the collection also goes heavy on leather-look vinyls, lace-ups and
zippers in odd locations on chaps, hot pants, bustiers, pegged jeans
and any other items the rocker feels naked without. These are topped
off with bangles, studs, insignias and other jewelry that might more
accurately be described as hardware.
   Bernstein, 25, is a former musician who says his clothes appeal
to rock band players and their fans. Sales in 1988 were around $1
million and marketed in Germany, Canada, Japan and the United
States. Outlets are boutiques, and prices range from $20 for a crop
top to about $100 for a vinyl jacket.
   Bernstein says he started his company in 1985 in his parents'
garage in Hollywood, having put his career as a rock musician behind
him at the age of 22. He now employs 30 people.

   It is possible that the madras shirt or silk
dress hanging in a department store window was designed by a
three-dimensional graphics processor, reports a computer industry
journal.
   Although 3-D computer workstations are usually used for molecular
modeling, seismic analysis and other scientific projects, notes MIS
week, several clothing manufacturers in the United States and Europe
have adopted computer-aided workstations for their designers.
   The workstations permit designers to scan fabrics, patterns and
models and then integrate the three in myriad combinations to
eliminate much of the guesswork inherent in clothing design, the
publication explains.
   It adds that additional software, in tandem with the workstation,
permits the designer to manipulate existing fabrics, or simulate
woven fabrics to create a new texture or pattern.

   In the past, pregnant women spent much of their time at home and
maternity fashions carried little significance.
   Today, with more and more women in the workplace, designers go
out of their way to produce chic and contemporary maternity clothes,
says Judy Loeb, director of design for Trio, manufacturers of
maternity clothing.
   She offers this advice for mothers-to-be:
   _ Buy your regular size; maternity clothes are made to
accommodate your changing body. Oversized regular clothing will hike
up in front. But pants occasionally should be one or two sizes
larger, to accommodate larger hips and thighs.
   _ Balance your wardrobe between career clothes and weekend wear.
   _ Reduce leg discomfort with support pantyhose.
   _ Wear a full or half slip to make clothes fall better and
provide a smoother silhouette.
   _ Wear natural fibers, like cotton, wool and some rayons.
   _ Space your purchases; leave some of your budget for impulse
buying, changing seasons and special events.

   When the temperature drops in this
southwest Michigan town, townsfolk see red. Red flannel, that is.
   This is the home of those 1880s-style, fire-engine-red long johns
with the button drop seats, as well as red flannel granny gowns with
matching dust caps and hardy red flannel lumberjack shirts.
   And residents aren't shy about their colorful claim to fame.
   Signs along the highway leading to this former logging town,
population 2,615, proclaim Cedar Springs ``Red Flannel Capital of
the World.''
   Red plywood long johns hang from the lampposts on Main Street.
There's the Red Flannel Insurance Center, the Red Flannel Car Wash,
and at the neighborhood tavern, you can get a Red Flannel cocktail _
vodka and cranberry juice. Up until a few weeks ago, you could play
a game of billiards there on a red flannel-topped pool table.
   In a warehouse a few blocks away, seamstresses piece together
bolts of red flannel and the polyester-cotton knit blend of which
the long johns are made.
   ``We think we're selling warmth across the board, not just the
warmth of the garments, but the warmth of the company, of the town''
says Charles Foley, president of The Red Flannel Factory.
   Red flannel is to this town's heritage what automobiles are to
Detroit.
   ``In school, the kids do cutouts of red flannels,'' said vice
president Mike Huckleberry, a Cedar Springs native. ``Almost
everyone in town feels a part of The Red Flannel Factory.''
   It began in 1936, when, during a brutal blizzard, a New York
feature writer wrote a piece complaining that there were no red
flannels to be found.
   The Cedar Springs' newspaper responded with a tart editorial:
``Just because Saks Fifth Avenue or Bergdorf Goodman do not carry
red flannels, it doesn't follow that no one in the country does.
We've got red flannels in Cedar Springs!''
   The Associated Press ran the newspaper's reply on its wire, and
in a few days, orders began pouring in from around the country to
Cedar Springs merchants. Ironically, those merchants were getting
their red flannels at the time from a Connecticut company.
   When the Connecticut manufacturer discontinued the items, a Cedar
Springs housewife began making red flannels in her home. That was in
1949. Three years later, The Red Flannel Factory was established by
Sally Wall, who converted a barn to meet the growing demand.
   When Wall retired in 1971, a group of about 10 area residents
formed a corporation. In 1986, a Grand Rapids holding company led by
Foley acquired a majority interest in the company with plans to
expand it nationally on a wholesale basis.
   Since then, Foley said, company sales have tripled and the number
of employees has doubled. He won't reveal sales, but says the
company brings in several million dollars a year. About 100
employees work for the company during peak production periods,
usually between June and the day before Christmas. Foley hopes there
will be enough work soon to keep the plant running at capacity
year-round.
   Long johns are the factory's biggest seller, with about 20,000
pairs sold each year. This year, the company is branching out with a
line of children's active wear and will introduce a red-based plaid.
   Among other items produced are night shirts, robes, children's
sleepers and pajamas, most of which are available in white,
natural-fiber muslin as well as the famous scarlet. Long johns
retail from $19 for childrens' sizes to $39 for adults.
   Among the celebrities with the company's long johns in their
closets are Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, Sammy Davis Jr., Kenny
Rogers and Andy Williams, Huckleberry says.
   While some large department stores carry the company's items,
Foley is targeting country stores, lingerie shops, college
bookstores and tourist spots in addition to the factory's mail-order
business.
   The common thread woven through the town's fabric is celebrated
each October with the Red Flannel Festival, complete with a Red
Flannel Queen. The 50th annual event this year will make it among
the oldest in Michigan.
   Anyone failing to wear red during the festival is ``arrested'' by
police and has to make a donation to charity to get out of jail.
   Doug Stein, owner of Der Bier Stein tavern, doesn't have to
worry. He wears a pair of long johns to work every day.
   ``We had to get air conditioning in here just because of that,''
he said with a chuckle.
   Foley hopes George Bush's election to the presidency of a
``kinder, gentler nation'' will help sales.
   ``It's like buying tradition _ a piece of Americana. It's like
buying an American flag,'' Foley said, stopping to reflect on his
last words. ``Maybe that's pushing it.''

<HEAD>Conrail Chairman Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard D. Sanborn, chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Consolidated Rail Corp., has died at the
age of 52.
   Sanborn died Sunday afternoon of an apparent heart attack, said
Sol Renick, a spokesman for the Philadelphia-based rail company.
   The board of directors will meet Wednesday to discuss a
successor, the company said.
   Sanborn, who had 27 years of experience in the railroad business,
took over as chairman on Jan. 1 with the retirement of L. Stanley
Crane, who in eight years guided the company from massive losses to
profitability.
   Conrail was formed by Congress in 1976 to reorganize six bankrupt
Northeast railroads, including the Penn Central. After 11 years of
government ownership, Conrail was sold March 26, 1987, for $1.6
billion in the largest public stock offering in U.S. history.
   Conrail's board elected Sanborn president and chief operating
officer when Crane announced his retirement a year ago.
   Before joining Conrail, Sanborn was president and CEO for CSX
Distribution Services Inc., a unit of the railroad holding company
CSX Corp.
   After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1960, Sanborn began
his railroad career with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1961 as
an attorney. He joined Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1972 and
worked his way to president and chief executive officer of Seaboard
System Inc. in 1982.
   He joined CSX as president and chief executive in 1986.
   Sanborn, a native of Sanbornville, N.H., graduated from the
University of New Hampshire in 1957.
   He is survived by his wife, Hilda Joan, two children and his
father.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Widens In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus rose in January over a year
ago as low oil prices continued to keep down import costs, the
Finance Ministry reported Monday.
   The surplus grew to $3.25 billion last month from $3.07 billion
in January 1988, but was well below the monthly record of $9.65
billion set in December.
   January exports rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier to $19.32
billion and imports climbed 12.7 percent to $16.07 billion. The
figures are compiled as the goods pass through customs.
   Japan's surplus with the United States, however, fell slightly
over a year ago, to $2.974 billion from $2.976 billion. Exports to
the U.S. market increased 11.1 percent to $6.50 billion, while
imports from the United States surged 22.4 percent to $3.52 billion.
   Finance Ministry officials said Japan's overall surplus rose
because of steady demand for Japanese goods in other countries
enjoying continued economic expansion and because of lower prices
for the crude oil Japan imports.
   They said imports of manufactured goods remain strong, a trend
they expect to continue for some time.
   In trade with the United States, Japan boosted car exports by 9.7
percent to $1.50 billion in January. U.S. steel sales in Japan
soared six-fold to $41.19 million and car sales nearly doubled to
$41.62 million.
   Japan's exports to the European Economic Community rose 6.4
percent to $3.66 billion in January, while imports from the EEC
leaped 24.4 percent to $2.02 billion. That left Japan with a surplus
of $1.64 billion, down from $1.82 billion in January 1988.
   Because of large oil imports, Japan ran a $1.04 billion deficit
in trade with the Middle East, down from $1.30 billion in January
1988.

<TEXT>
   Consolidated Freightways, Inc., said
Monday it will acquire Emery Air Freight Corp. in a cash deal valued
at $230 million.
   Emery, one of the nation's largest air freight carriers, has
accepted Consolidated's offer of $7.75 a share in cash for all
outstanding common stock and $21.10 per share in cash for all
outstanding preferred stock, the companies said.
   The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of
both companies, according to the announcement.
   Lary Scott, president of Consolidated Freightways, said the
combined company will operate under the name ``Emery Worldwide, a CF
Company.''
   Emery has undergone a restructuring in recent years as
competition from other overnight delivery services stiffened. The
competitive climate is likely to heat up even more if the pending
buyout of Tiger International by Federal Express Corp. is completed.
   In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the latest period for which
the company has reported earnings, Emery lost $9.95 million, or 41
cents a share, on revenue of $313.8 million.
   In 1987, Emery bought Purolator Courier Corp. but its service
levels remained disappointing as it integrated Purolator's field
operations into its own.
   Last year, Tennessee businessman and former Federal Express
executive Arthur Bass said that he was considering taking over the
company, but no deal ever emerged.
   Emery Chairman William F. Souders told the annual meeting in May
that the company was ``positioning (itself) for the long haul.'' He
said then that Emery's goal was to become a ``strong, profitable,
customer-driven company.''
   Souders said the merger with Consolidated would ``offer customers
the best service available.''
   Consolidated Freightways does business in trucking and air
freight delivery. Its 1988 revenue totaled $2.7 billion.
   The Wilton, Conn.-based Emery, which employs about 17,000 people,
provides worldwide air courier and cargo service.

<HEAD>Rig Count Plunges By 34 to 746</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs continued
its recent decline, plunging by 34 to total 746 this week, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   This week's drop was largely caused by decreases in Oklahoma,
which lost 17 rigs, and Louisiana, which lost nine rigs.
   A year ago, the count totaled 968. Last week, the count dropped
by 17 to total 780.
   Two weeks ago, the number of rigs rose by eight to total 797
while plummeting by 51 the week before. In the three weeks before
that, the count declined twice by 32 and once by 36, all following a
two-week increase of 25 rigs.
   Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge said the count usually drops
off during late December through late March or early April.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among other major oil producing states, Wyoming lost four rigs,
Texas lost two and Kansas and North Dakota were each down by one.
   California and Michigan each gained four rigs and New Mexico got
three more. Colorado and Ohio each got one more rig.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders said most of the pressure at the bell was the result of
follow-through selling after Friday's sharply lower close in the
bean pits, as well as showers over the weekend in the key South
American growing regions of Argentina and Brazil.
   New-crop beans, however, managed to avoid most of the downturn,
in part because the government said late last week it would limit
how much soybean planting will be allowed on set-aside land.
   On the opening, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.26 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
2 cents lower, with March at $2.64{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to
2\ cents lower, with March at $2.04{ a bushel; and soybeans were \

   Livestock futures were mostly higher, but pork futures mostly
lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .45 higher, with February at
74.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .55 cent higher,
with March at 82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to

<HEAD>Lorenzo Orders Fortune Put Back On Eastern Flights</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: UPDATES throughout with Lorenzo ordering magazine back on planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo has told Eastern
Airlines officials to allow copies of the Feb. 27 Fortune magazine
on the airline's fleet even though that issue carries a
less-than-flattering profile of Lorenzo, Eastern officials said
today.
   The airline had ordered the biweekly business magazine pulled
from its fleet of more than 200 aircraft because it contains a cover
story calling Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent company, one of
``America's Toughest Bosses.''
   ``Lorenzo personally instructed that Fortune be put back on the
planes,'' said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell. ``He knew nothing
about the original decision to remove it. He said we had no business
taking it off in the first place. Lorenzo is saying we're not in the
business of censorship.''
   The earlier order had come from middle managers in Eastern's
aircraft services support department, Matell said.
   In a brief directive to aircraft service managers around the
country, Eastern had said: ``It's imperative that the current issue
of Fortune magazine be removed immediately from all Eastern aircraft.
   ``Dispose of all copies locally,'' said the directive. ``Have a
member of management audit all aircraft to ensure compliance. Report
accomplishment by tail number to Miami.''
   Lorenzo's picture appears on the issue's cover. A caption states
that Lorenzo ``likes managers to work 14 hours a day, six days a
week.''
   The brief profile calls Lorenzo a ``loose cannon'' and quotes
past and present executives of Houston-based Texas Air as saying
Lorenzo is a highly impulsive manager.
   ``He is a visionary, a dealmaker, a union buster and a
showboater,'' says the profile, part of a larger article on other
``tough'' corporate chieftans.
   The story also talks of intrigue and backbiting among Texas Air's
executives.
   Art Kent, a Texas Air spokesman in Houston, concurred that
Lorenzo did not issue the directive.
   ``If Frank had made such an order, I would know about it and he
has not,'' Kent said Sunday.
   Continental Airlines doesn't normally stock the magazine on its
flights, he said.
   Matell said Eastern, which faces a March 4 strike threat by the
International Association of Machinists, had nothing to gain by
leaving the magazine on its planes.
   ``The profile of (Texas Air's) chairman was unflattering and
would be viewed in that vein by our passengers,'' Matell told The
Miami Herald earlier. ``Considering the current environment, we
decided to remove the issue.''

   The same people who eagerly seek rebates of a few
hundred dollars on new-car purchases or wait in line at appliance
store sales could be tossing away tens of thousands of dollars on
their IRA accounts.
   It is being done every day, casually and indifferently, by
thousands of individuals who (1) fail to shop for the best rates,
which now vary widely, and (2) fail to comprehend the impact of
compounding over extended time periods.
   Adding to the waste and confusion is institutional ignorance of
their own products, according to Joe A. Mintz, an analyst and critic
of insurance and financial practices.
   In a check of 13 institutions in the first week of February, he
found only a couple that could even estimate the total a certain
deposit amount would become over a specific time period. Three
branches of the same bank gave different figures.
   After 34 years of dealing with the sale of insurance, annuities,
certificates of deposit, Medicare, retirement plans and the like,
the soft-spoken, intense, Mintz believes consumers need factual
point-of-sale information.
   In pursuit of his goal, he has testified before committees of
Congress, offered his somewhat testy and often unwelcome views at
insurance industry meetings and aided government agencies in studies
of IRAs and insurance.
   He publishes the NROCA (``acorn'' backwards) Newsletter _
Department C, NROCA Press, Box 12066, Dallas, Texas 75225. It seeks
to give ``one or two ideas a year to retirees and preretirees that
will be worth hundreds if not multi-thousands of dollars.''
   NROCA's most recent offering, at $8.75 a copy, is a ``Consumer's
Guide to Compound Interest,'' providing 1,600 yields arranged to
allow even financially unsophisticated individuals to analyze IRAs,
insurance, CDs, and savings.
   Though a thorn to financial and insurance institutions, Mintz
remains in the mainstream, if barely. His views are heard if not
welcomed. He authored a study course presented by the American
Institute of CPAs. He is on the editorial board of a professional,
financially-oriented national magazine.
   Working with telephone and computer from his home, Mintz found
published certificate of deposit yields ranging from 8.33 percent to
9.8 percent at institutions throughout the country during the first
week of February.
   That difference in yields could mean that a $10,000 investment
after 30 years might be worth $110,271 _ or $165,223. It would mean
that a $2,000 deposit each year for 30 years could be worth $260,800
_ or $347,826.
   To his dismay, he found that while financial institutions quote
precise interest rates, almost none can state accurately how much a
deposit will total over a specific time period. That is, what the
annual yield would be.
   Interest rates and yields differ, mainly because of compounding,
which can be daily, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually.
The differences seem small, but time magnifies them. Compounding,
therefore, can be magic or tragic _ magic if you utilize it, tragic
if you don't.
   At an interest rate of 10 percent compounded annually, for
example, $10,000 becomes $67,275 in 20 years. If compounded daily,
the 10 percent rate totals $75,962, a yield of 10.67 percent a year.
   Mintz bases his conclusion _ that institutions cannot calculate
yields _ on the responses to his request for information on the
placement with them of $87,000 in a rollover IRA for three or five
years.
   His question: ``How much in cash can I withdraw without penalty
at the end of the period? Also, give me the rate and yield.''
   It was then, he says, that three branches of one bank gave
answers ranging from $118,000 to $133,000 for the five-year period.
And a bank that advertised quarterly compounding, he says, based
calculations on 360 rather than 365 days.

   Federal regulators today took over the
operations of Midwest Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association and
announced the resignation of the thrift's chairman, who is among the
targets of an FBI fraud probe.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines said it had declared
Midwest Federal insolvent and appointed the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. conservator under a program announced by President
Bush last week.
   In the same statement, the home loan bank said Midwest Federal
Chairman Harold Greenwood Jr. and the thrift's managing officer,
Charlotte Massica, resigned.
   U.S. Attorney Jerome Arnold of Minneapolis last week said
Greenwood and Massica were among the targets of an FBI investigation
into possible fraud at Midwest Federal.
   Thurman C. Connell, president of the Des Moines bank, said in a
statement that Greenwood resigned because ``he needed to focus on
personal issues.''
   ``Greenwood, in cooperation with federal regulators, determined
his resignation was in the best interests of Midwest Federal,'' the
statement said.

   Stock prices closed sharply lower but above their
worst levels Monday amid renewed concern that British interest rates
could remain high for an extended period.
   Dealers said trading was cautious following comments by
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson over the weekend that
Britain's January inflation rate would show a ``particularly marked
rise.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 23.4
points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,032.7. The index was down a minimum
18.8 points in early business, but then moved as much as 35.2 points
lower in early afternoon.
   Volume was light, as 474.5 million shares changed hands, down
substantially from Friday's 671.4 million shares and sharply lower
than the brisk pace of dealing seen in recent weeks.
   Britain's inflation figures are due on Friday.
   Lawson seemed to be preparing markets for bad news with a warning
that the annual inflation rate would top 7 percent in January. That
would compare with an annual rise in December of 6.8 percent.

<HEAD>Study: Mexico Lost Half Its Foreign Reserves in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's foreign reserves plummeted by 50
percent to around $8 billion last year, one of the most severe costs
of an otherwise successful anti-inflation program, according to a
private think tank.
   Investor disbelief that the government would maintain the
program's freeze on the peso-dollar exchange rate was a leading
cause of capital flight, the Center for Private Sector Economic
Studies said in a review of the Mexican anti-inflation program.
   Investors fearing a sudden peso devaluation made advance
purchases of capital goods from abroad, sustaining economic activity
and increasing imports of items such as machinery despite the
government's efforts to slow it, the report said.
   However, some $700 million in capital returned to Mexico in
January, even after the government instituted a gradual peso
devaluation, the central bank announced last week.
   The Center's report, based on government and central bank data,
was released over the weekend.
   The government did surpass its chief economic policy goal last
year by halving an inflation rate that reached a record 159.2
percent in 1987. Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent in 1988 under
the program that froze the dollar-peso exchange rate, the minimum
wage and prices for government-regulated goods and services.
   But despite its initial success in curbing inflation, the
government failed to overcome ``general skepticism towards the
program's viability,'' said the Center's report.
   The result was ``a wave of speculation'' by nervous investors
that prompted capital flight, it said.
   Pre-payments of private sector foreign debts and depressed export
revenues from oil also contributed to the run on reserves, it said.
   In addition, the program's wage and price freezes cut workers'
real purchasing power by 15 percent last year and created price
distortions for regulated goods and services, the Center said.
   Shortages developed for some basics, including meats, milk and
certain vegetables, as producers withheld their product from the
market to protest official prices they considered too low.
   The plunge in reserves prompted President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari to adopt the gradual currency devaluation Jan. 1 that is
averaging one peso per day.
   The private sector financed imports through non-oil export
revenue and with credits from outside the nationalized banking
system. Representing 90 percent of total Mexican imports, capital
goods imports between January and October 1988 surged by 55.4
percent over the same period in 1987.
   Consequently, the economy actually registered 0.5 percent growth
in 1988, although ``the hoped-for recession...only began to develop
towards the end of the year,'' the report said.

because of follow-through selling after Friday's sharply lower close

growing regions of Argentina and Brazil.
   New-crop beans, however, slipped only half as much, in part
because the government said late last week it would limit how much
soybean planting will be allowed on set-aside land.

<TEXT>
   Palo Verde Unit 3 generated more
electricty last year than any nuclear plant in the world, operators
said Monday.
   The Arizona Nuclear Power Project said statistics from Nucleonics
Week, a publication of the nuclear industry, show that the newest of
three units at the generating station 50 miles west of Phoenix
produced 10.87 million megawatt hours last year _ enough for two
cities the size of Tucson.
   The output of the plant's other two reactors lagged, however.
According to Nuclear Regulatory Commission figures, Unit 1 has
operated at 51 percent of capacity since its startup in late 1985,
and Unit 2 has run at 67.3 percent.
   Unit 3, which was started in late 1987 and entered commercial
operation early in 1988, has operated at nearly 90 percent of
capacity and last summer set a U.S. record of 214 days of continuous
operation after startup.
   It also set a U.S. record for a month, with 955,400 megawatts in
March.
   Each of the triplet reactors is rated at 1,270 megawatts. ANPP
officials said they serve 4 million customers of the seven utilities
in Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico which united to build
the $9.3 billion complex.
   The publication listed the Grohnde and Philippsburg-2 nuclear
plants in West Germany as Nos. 2 and 3 in the world, with 1988
production of 10.79 million and 10.21 million megawatts,
respectively.

   The Hotel Bel-Air, a 92-room luxury hotel popular
for years with movie stars and other celebrities, is up for sale.
   The hotel, one mile west of Beverly Hills' famous Rodeo Drive,
has drawn considerable investor interest, said officials of
Dallas-based Rosewood Property Co.
   ``Because of its world-class reputation, we have for some time
had incredible investor interest in the property at world record
prices,'' said Denny Alberts, Rosewood Property chairman and chief
executive officer, in a statement.
   ``We believe that it is an appropriate business decision for us
to realize an outstanding profit at this time by selling the Hotel
Bel-Air while maintaining a management contract.''
   The hotel's rooms, including 33 suites, are arranged in one- and
two-story, mission-style buildings and bungalows on an 11.5-acre,
lushly landscaped estate. Laurie Farmer, Rosewood Hotel Group
advertising and marketing manager, said estimates are the hotel is
worth $1 million per room.
   Hotel spokeswoman Donna Smith in Newport, Calif. said no names of
interested buyers had yet surfaced because the sale was a
``closed-bid process.''
   Guests at the hotel have included Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren,
Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, said Ms. Smith.
   On Jan. 29, ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson nabbed an intruder in
his room at the Bel-Air as the man rifled through the purse of
Johnson's fiancee, actress Melanie Griffith. Johnson stopped the man
from taking expensive jewelry and held the intruder for police.

<HEAD>School Endowment Performance Hurt by Stock Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College and university endowments earned some
money on their investments for fiscal 1988 but the performance was
hurt by the stock market crash, a study reported Monday.
   The National Association of College and University Business
Officers said that the average rate of return for the period July 1,
1987 to June 30, 1988 was 1.3 percent. That was down from 13.9
percent in fiscal 1987.
   ``Considering the year on the stock market, we were pleased that
they had a positive rate of return,'' said association spokeswoman
Lucy Howton. She said the endowments held their own for a number of
reasons.
   ``The best stocks did rebound after the crash,'' she said. ``And
not all institutions are totally invested into stocks. Bonds and CDs
did well.''
   The endowment study of 315 schools, conducted annually since
1974, showed total market value for participating funds at $49.5
billion in fiscal 1988, up from $47.9 billion the previous year.
   The 10 participating institutions with the highest endowment fund
assets were the same 10 as the year before, in the same order.
Harvard topped the list with an endowment of nearly $4.2 billion, as
of mid-1988. The University of Texas system was second with $2.8
billion, followed by Princeton at $2.3 billion and Yale at $2.1
billion.
   The other top 10 institutions were Stanford, $1.6 billion;
Columbia, $1.4 billion; Texas A&amp;M, $1.2 billion; Washington
University, $1.1 billion; MIT, $1.1 billion; and the University of
California, $1.1 billion.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen years after rising from the
ashes of six bankrupt Northeast railroads, Conrail must replace its
top executive at a time when it had just made a transition aimed at
continuity.
   Richard D. Sanborn, 52, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack,
just six weeks after becoming chairman and chief executive officer
of the Philadelphia-based freight carrier.
   Speculation by some analysts focused Monday on H. William Brown,
senior vice president for finance, and Charles N. Marshall, senior
vice president for marketing and sales, as two candidates to take
Sanborn's place.
   Others suggested L. Stanley Crane, 73, who retired as chairman
and CEO on Jan. 1, could return for an interim period while a search
was made for someone from outside the company.
   Conrail said it would make no announcement before a board of
directors meeting Wednesday.
   Sanborn, a 27-year railroad veteran, joined Conrail last March as
president and chief operating officer.
   Tony Hatch, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said he considered
it likely that Crane would be asked to return on a temporary basis.
   Crane, who led the company for eight years, is credited with
setting the direction that made Conrail profitable and enabled it to
be returned to the private sector through a public stock offering in
March 1987.
   Despite Sanborn's death, analysts said the railroad's future
appears bright.
   ``There is no single person who is indispensible to a company,''
said an analyst who asked not to be identified. ``This is not a
major disaster for Conrail, though it's certainly tough in the short
run.''
   Conrail was formed by Congress in 1976 to reorganize six bankrupt
Northeast railroads, the Penn Central, Erie Lackawanna, Reading,
Central of New Jersey, Lehigh Valley and Lehigh &amp; Hudson River.
After 11 years of government ownership, Conrail was sold March 26,
1987, for $1.6 billion in the largest public stock offering in U.S.
history.
   Conrail has been trying to build its traffic in such areas as
automobile shipping after concentrating on rebuilding track, gaining
clearance for double-stacked container cars and other equipment
needs.
   Under Sanborn, Conrail had been expected to try to expand into
such areas as hauling waste and already is carrying compacted refuse
from northern New Jersey and the New York City area to eastern Ohio.
   Company executives said recently they might seek to acquire some
smaller rail lines, including the Monongahela and the Pittsburgh and
Lake Erie railroads.

<TEXT>
   American consumers accustomed to finding
``Made in Japan'' stamped on cameras and radios increasingly can
find those words on packages of a more intimate product: condoms.
   Okamoto Industries Inc., Japan's leading condom maker with a 63
percent market share, last year launched a U.S. subsidiary and plans
to have its product on store shelves in the Northeast in a couple of
months.
   Other Japanese companies also have entered the U.S. market in
recent years.
   While some industry analysts say high consumer brand loyalty
makes it difficult for the Japanese to grab market share, Hisayuki
Naito, general manager of Okamoto U.S.A. Inc., predicts Okamoto will
capture 10 percent of the American condom market in two years and up
to 25 percent within seven.
   ``The Japanese philosphy is that once we have committed
ourselves, we will do it,'' said Naito, who sees a vast untapped
market in America because of health concerns about AIDS and the
birth control pill.
   U.S. retail condom sales increased 62 percent to $292 million
between 1985 and 1987, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.
   But only 16 percent of Americans use condoms as the primary form
of birth control compared with 76 percent in Japan, where the birth
control pill is illegal, analysts say.
   ``In this country, the condom is a very hidden product,'' Naito
said during a recent interview. A display rack with packages of
Okamoto's American competitors decorates one wall of a conference
room at the company headquarters.
   ``This is more healthy, no question about it,'' Naiko said,
unfurling a pink Crown condom, one of four Okamoto brands to be
marketed in the United States.
   The company plans a $2 million ad campaign stressing the quality
of its condoms, including print ads in Vogue, Playboy and The
Advocate, a magazine aimed at gays.
   One ad features a photo of a condom stretched by two fingers _ a
frankness that Okamoto hopes will help Americans overcome their
shyness about the product, Naito said.
   The other Okamoto lines are Harmony, Regal and Beyond, which is
packaged in a plastic compact case and is aimed at women, who
account for 25 to 40 percent of all U.S. condom purchasers.
   Okamoto is an $800 million-a-year company that also sells tires,
distributes Reebok, Keds and Rockport shoes in Japan and makes the
plastic interiors for Honda, General Motors and Ford cars.
   Condoms, which Okamoto also sells in Europe and Canada, account
for about 10 percent of the company's business.
   Okamoto has six employees in Stratford and marketing deals with
eight independent wholesalers. It will continue shipping condoms
from Japan but may eventually build a U.S. plant, Naito said.
   Other Japanese companies long have been trying to crack the U.S.
market.
   Fugi Latex Co., the No. 2 Japanese condom maker, and Nisshoiwa
Corp. of America, a Japanese trading company, own 60 percent of
Safetex Corp. of Lyndhurst, N.J. under a joint venture begun in
1987. Fuji has made condoms in the United States since buying the
Newark plant of Circle Rubber Co. about 15 years ago, which it since
has closed.
   Sagami Rubber Industries Inc.'s Kimono condom has been imported
by Mayer Laboratories Inc., of Oakland, Calif., since April 1987.
   Industry analysts warn that the Japanese may have difficulty in
the U.S. condom market because Americans remain somewhat embarrassed
by the subject. They therefore are likely to stay with brands they
recognize and can grab quickly from store shelves.
   New York-based Carter-Wallace Inc., maker of the Trojans brand of
condoms, now controls about 53 percent of the market. Schmid
Laboratories Inc., based in Little Falls, N.J., controls about 27
percent of the market with such brands as Ramses, Sheik and Excita.
   Salomon Brothers predicts condom sales will continue growing at
15 percent annually in the foreseeable future. But some observers
predict growth will slow with the calming of fears about
heterosexual transmission of AIDS.

   Cuba announced a campaign Monday to boost
sugar production to an all-time high over the next couple of years,
mostly for export to Socialist bloc countries.
   Production from this year's harvest, which began in November, is
expected to top 8 million tons and grow to 9 million tons a year
after that, the state-run Prensa Latina news agency said in a
dispatch monitored in Mexico.
   It quoted Juan Herrera, sugar industry minister, as saying the
campaign includes better growing methods and savings in fuel used in
harvesting and milling sugarcane.
   Sugar, which is government-owned, is Cuba's principal industry
and accounts for about 80 percent of the country's foreign income.
   Exports in 1988 totaled 6.5 million tons, with 83 percent going
to Socialist bloc countries, the dispatch said.

   ``I'm in no hurry to close it. It's a very successful operation
now,'' Trump said.
   Then, having given with one hand, the billionaire developer took
away with the other by adding: ``But since it's the greatest
location in the world, anything would be successful there.''
   Stories in newspapers ranging from the Wall Street Journal to the
Village Voice helped. So did a New York Times editorial pining the
passing of such Trader Vic palate pleasers as the Mai Tai or the
Scorpion with gardenia afloat, the Samoan Fog Cutter or the Dr. Funk
of Tahiti.
   The restaurant part of Trader Vic's, which operated from the
Plaza basement for 25 years, closed a year ago, but the bar stayed
open.
   Trump bought the Plaza last year for $390 million. He said in
January that a classy Oriental restaurant and a health club would
begin materializing in April or May in the space from which he was
bouncing Trader Vic's.
   ``I now have no set timetable on this,'' he says now. ``I haven't
decided what to do with the space yet.''
   The Trader Vic's chain operates more than 20 restaurants in the
United States, Canada, West Germany and Japan.

<HEAD>EEC Members Disagree On Uniform Tax On Interest Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Community countries disagreed
Monday on a proposed witholding tax of 15 percent on interest income
from bonds and bank savings and sent the plan to a high-level study
group.
   At a meeting of the EEC economics and finance ministers, Britain
and Luxembourg completely opposed the Commission's proposal while
West Germany sought a reduction in toward the level of its own tax
of 10 percent.
   Of the other member states, France, Italy, Spain, Denmark,
Portugal, Ireland and Belgium broadly supported the proposal.
   The proposal was made last week by the European Commission in an
effort to harmonize the widely different taxes on interest income in
the 12 member States _ from zero in Luxembourg to 35 percent in
Ireland.
   Because EEC laws on taxation need to be approved unanimously,
diplomats said that it was difficult to see how the proposals could
be adopted unless radical changes were made.
   Luxembourg's Finance Minister Jacques Poos said Luxembourg would
block the commission's plan. Luxembourg, which has banking secrecy
laws and is considered the EEC's tax haven, fears its economy will
suffer if a tax is imposed.
   The high-level study group is expected to complete its report in
four to six weeks. The ministers will discuss its conclusions at
their regular monthly meeting in April. The group is composed of the
chief tax authorities of the twelve EEC member states.

   General Motors Acceptance Corp. on Monday
announced a 9.5 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profits,
while GM Hughes Electronics reported a 16.5 percent profit rise and
Electronic Data Systems Corp. had a 0.8 percent earnings drop during
the period.
   The three subsidiaries of the nation's biggest carmaker reported
their earnings in advance of the parent company, which was expected
to announce overall results Tuesday.
   GMAC, the company's financing and mortgage operation, posted a
profit of $257.4 million in the final three months of 1988. That
compared with net income of $235 million in the same period of 1987.
   Revenue during the quarter fell to $3.36 billion from $3.44
billion a year earlier.
   Fourth quarter 1987 earnings were considered unusually low
because of a surge in refinancing mortgages that GMAC assumed with
the purchase of two mortgage companies in 1985, the company said.
   GMAC's 1988 profit fell 18.3 percent to $1.19 billion from $1.45
billion. Annual revenue rose to $13.5 billion from $13.4 billion in
1987.
   EDS said it earned $103.4 million, or 85 cents a share, in the
fourth quarter of last year, compared with $104.2 million, or 85
cents a share, during the same period in 1987. Revenue rose to $1.3
billion from $1.19 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, EDS had a profit of $384.1 million, or $3.15 a
share, up from $323.1 million, or $2.65 a share, during 1987. The
company said it expanded its business base in 1988 in the
commercial, international, governmental, financial and insurance
markets as well as signing a five-year agreement with GM.
   Annual revenue rose to $4.84 billion from $4.43 billion in 1987.
   GM Hughes Electronics said its fourth-quarter 1988 earnings rose
to $169.5 million, or 43 cents a share, from $145.5 million, or 36
cents a share, during the same quarter in 1987. Revenue during
fourth quarter 1988 was $3.1 billion, up from $2.7 billion a year
earlier.
   For the entire year, GM Hughes earned $653.3 million, or $2.01 a
share, up 25.3 percent from $521.1 million, or $1.67 per share, in
1987 profits. Annual revenues rose to $11.2 billion last year from
$10.5 billion in 1987.
   The earnings include the impact of a first quarter accounting
change, which boosted net income by $18.7 million.
   EDS earnings are the base for GM Class E stock and GM Hughes
profits are linked to GM's Class H stock.
   Last week, GM announced a 20 percent increase in its dividend and
a 2-for-1 split of its common stocks. Dividends rose 41 percent for
GM's Class E stock and 64 percent for GM Class H stock.
   Ford Motor Co.'s earnings are expected to be announced Thursday.
   On Feb. 2, Chrysler Corp. posted a fourth quarter profit of
$433.6 million, or $1.85 per share, and annual earnings of $1.05
billion, or $4.66 a share, down 18.6 percent from 1987.
   The Big Three automakers are expected to earn a total of about
$11 billion in 1988, breaking the companies' combined 1984 earnings
record of $9.79 billion.

   Stock prices showed some spotty losses in erratic
trading today, extending last week's decline.
   Interest rates edged upward in the credit markets today amid
expectations of action soon by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   Analysts said stock traders also were in an edgy mood following
the market's decline Friday, which was the largest since Wall
Street's winter-long rally began.
   Prices tumbled Friday after the Labor Department reported that
producer prices of finished goods jumped 1 percent in January,
exceeding analysts' projections.
   Then stocks had to absorb another jolt when banks across the
country raised their prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11
percent.
   Today, however, early selling of blue chips apparently pushed
them down to levels where they attracted a few traders who had been
waiting for a pullback as a buying opportunity.

<HEAD>Four Arrested On Bribe Charges In Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Stands for item slugged AM-Japan-Scandal on AM-Business News

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Monday made the first arrests
directly involving the stock transactions that have scandalized the
government of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Japanese waited to see what prosecutors would do next, since
dozens of politicians, businessmen and journalists were among those
who bought bargain-priced stock unavailable to the public, and then
profited handsomely when public sales began and prices soared.
   Among the four arrested was Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and former
chairman of Recruit Co., the information conglomerate at the center
of the scandal.
   Ezoe and Hiroshi Kobayashi, vice president of First Finance, a
Recruit subsidiary that financed the stock sales, were held on
suspicion of offering bribes in return for favors related to
Recruit's business activities.
   Also arrested were Ei Shikiba and Hisahiko Hasegawa, former
directors of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest
company, for altegedly receiving bribes from Recruit in tnyPCorm of
bargain shares. Both have said they did not provide any favors for
Recruit.
   Recruit and NTT said in Statements that they regretted the
prosecutors' actions.
   Takeshita told reporters Monday he hoped for a full investigation
into the scandal, but refused to comment further. A Takeshita aide
and relative have been linked to the stock purchases.
   The Japan Socialist Party credited public disgust with the
scandal for its victory in a special parliamentary election Sunday,
and it demanded that Takeshita resign or call new general elections.
   Replying in Parliament, Takeshita dismissed the demands. He said
he ``humbly accepted'' the election results and that his governing
Liberal Democratic Party will work for reforms to restore public
trust in politics.
   In making the arrests, prosecutors said the Supreme Court ruled
in July that the sale of stock whose price was sure to rise and
which could not be easily purchased by the general public amounted
to bribery.
   Japanese law provides for up to five years in prison for
receivers of bribes, and up to three years for those who offer
bribes.
   The scandal surfaced last summer, raising questions of ethics and
money links between business and politicians.
   The only previous arrest had been of a Recruit official accused
of trying to bribe an opposition member of Parliament to soft-pedal
an investigation into the affair.
   Takeshita formed a new Cabinet last December to put the scandal
behind him, but two ministers soon were forced to resign after it
was disclosed they had continued receiving political donations from
Recruit.
   In all, three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen politicians
and businessmen have resigned because of the scandal.
   In Sunday's special election, the Japan Socialist Party won the
upper house seat of a Liberal Democrat who died in December. The
election in Fukuoka in southern Japan was the first for a national
office since the scandal surfaced.
   Takako Doi, the Socialists' chairwoman, said in Parliament Monday
that Takeshita should resign.
   ``Either the entire Cabinet must resign, or the prime minister
must dissolve Parliament so the people can express their will,'' Ms.
Doi said.
   A dissolution of Parliament would force elections in the powerful
lower house, where the Liberal Democrats have more than 300 of the
512 seats.
   Takeshita told Japanese reporters the special election was a
``complete defeat. I never anticipated it.''
   ``I will stake everything on political reform,'' he told
Parliament on Monday.
   An election is scheduled in July for half the seats in
Parliament's upper house. A severe setback then could threaten
Takeshita's chances to win another two-year term as party leader and
prime minister in October.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index fell Monday for the
first time in eight sessions. Market analysts blamed the governing
party's defeat in the special election and eroding confidence in the
Takeshita administration.

   Fabrique Nationale, Belgium's arms

from the U.S. Defense Department.
   The order to deliver 30,000 machine guns and 267,000 rifles was
given to FN Manufacturing Inc., a fully owned FN subsidiary in the
U.S.
   The final announcement of the order had been delayed until the
U.S. General Accounting Office investigated a complaint by the Colt
Firearms group, which designed the basic model of the FN rifle and
had tried to block the order. The GAO decided in favor of FN last
month.
   FN said the weapons would be produced between 1990 and 1994.

<HEAD>Preliminary Bids Due Tuesday for National Enquirer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inquiring minds will have to wait until spring to
find out the winning bidder for the company that owns the gossipy
tabloid The National Enquirer.
   An official for one of the investment banking firms handling the
sale said Monday that preliminary bids for GP Group Inc. were due
Tuesday, although announcement of a winner wasn't expected until
spring.
   Prospective bidders were expected to include Robert Maxwell, the
British publishing figure who has moved aggressively into the U.S.
market in recent months, paying $2.6 billion last fall for the
publishing giant Macmillan Inc.
   Others mentioned as potential bidders are Mike Rosenbloom, a
Canadian investor who owns rivals Globe, National Examiner and Sun;
Hachette SA, the French publishing concern that also has made
serveral U.S. acquisitions in recent years; and employees of GP
Group.
   The auction is being handled by the Blackstone Group, a private
New York investment bank, and Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates Inc., an
investment banker specializing in communications properties.
   Austin Beutner, an executive at the Blackstone Group, said there
has been ``lots of interest'' in privately-held GP Group since it
was put up for sale late last year after its owner, Generoso Pope,
died.
   ``There are many serious parties and we expect the transaction to
be announced sometime in the spring,'' he said.
   Beutner declined to identify any of those who have expressed
interest in bidding and declined to comment on what price the
company may bring.
   GP Group owns The National Enquirer and its sister publication
Weekly World News. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the
Enquirer had an average weekly circulation of 4.3 million in the six
months ended June 30, 1988, while Weekly World News was just over 1
million.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices rose sharply in moderate
trading Monday, surprising analysts who said there was little news
to stir the market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled 48
cents higher at $17.59 a barrel. Last week, the contract fluctuated
before closing the week at $17.11. Other contract months also rose.
   Among refined products on the exchange, the March contract for
unleaded gasoline rose 0.58 cent to 48.15 cents a gallon, while
domestic heating oil scheduled for delivery next month closed up
0.81 cent at 48.17 cents a gallon. Other contract months also gained.
   Mary L. Haskins, assistant vice president of institutional energy
futures for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the rally came as a
surprise.
   ``It baffled most traders, to be honest with you,'' she said.
``In fact, the market fundamentals were mildly bearish.''
   The International Energy Agency, for example, lowered its
estimate of demand growth for 1989, Ms. Haskins said. Earlier
projections of strong demand growth had helped push the market up in
recent weeks.
   Other talk in the market focused on news that Iran, one of 13
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans
to increase its production capacity to 4 million barrels a day this
year, from about 3.5 million. However, Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh said Iran would adhere to its quota even with higher
capacity.
   Greg Dreis, energy broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
attributed Monday's gains to technical factors after a week of
fluctuating prices.
   ``There were more people coming in and that made the market more
susceptible to a rally,'' he said.

   Stock prices posted some scattered losses in a
quiet session Monday, extending last week's decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 36.97
points on Friday, slipped another 3.57 to 2,282.50.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in

   Champion Products Inc., a maker of
athletic and leisure clothing, successfully fought off a hostile
takeover and agreed Monday to be sold to Sara Lee Corp. of Chicago
for $320.9 million.
   The announcement that the food and apparel giant would buy
Champion for $77 a share followed Champion's request for bids to
fend off a takeover by a New York investment group.
   ``Our shareholders are receiving full value and this transaction
is the best possible outcome for our employees, customers and the
communities in which we operate,'' Champion President Roger Holland
said.
   Champion, well-known in college bookstores around the country for
sweatshirts and T-shirts, had been a takeover target of the
investment group Walsh, Greenwood &amp; Co.
   Acting through Phonicam Inc., a company created to attempt the
takeover, the investment group had offered $51 a share, $55 a share
and last month upped its offer to $61 a share.
   ``I think the $61 figure was getting into an area that
shareholders may have started thinking they were getting fair value,
and that's why management went looking for buyers,'' said Patricia
Ryan, an analyst for Rayomnd James &amp; Associates, a St. Petersburg,
Fla.-based borkerage firm.
   Sara Lee officials said they would begin a tender offer this week
for the 4.16 million outstanding shares of fully diluted Champion
stock and various convertible stock options.
   Champion stock climbed $12.125 to close at $75.75 in American
Stock Exchange trading Monday.
   After the deal was announced, a spokesman for Phonicam said the
company couldn't justify spending that much money for Champion.
   Ryan said she thought the sale to Sara Lee might help Champion
continue its fast-paced growth because the company might receive
more capital investment from its new parent.
   Champion has enjoyed 14 straight quarters of increased sales and
profits, and last year boosted earnings 114 percent to $14.89
million, or $4.34 a share, on sales of $219 million.
   Although the company is best known for uniforms and athletic
clothes, much of Champion's recent growth has come by adding leisure
wear and branching out into department and specialty stores.
   Sara Lee, one of the nation's 50 largest companies, sells
packaged food and various consumer products and operates a food
service business. The company reported $10.4 billion in sales in its
last fiscal year.
   ``One of our missions is to grow all of our businesses, and
strategic acquisition is one way of doing that,'' Sara Lee spokesman
Ron Culp said. ``This was just one of those good opportunities that
come along.''
   Culp said the company had not been interested in buying Champion
until it was asked to make a bid for the suburban Rochester-based
firm.
   Champion will join Sara Lee's other apparel companies, including
Hanes underwear, L'eggs hosiery, Isotoner gloves and Bali bras.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Monday it will shift
production of three light-duty trucks to a Wisconsin plant from
Michigan in 1991.
   GM spokesman Tom Klipstine also said the automaker would put
production of at least one new truck line in its Flint, Mich.,
plant, which has about 3,800 workers to compensate for the switch to
a plant in Janesville.
   GM said production of its Chevrolet Suburban and Blazer trucks
and the GMC Jimmy utility vehicles would be moved from Flint to
Janesville in 1991 for the 1992 model year.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson announced the move in Milwaukee.
   The Janesville plant, which employs about 5,700 people, currently
produces the Buick Skylark and the Chevrolet Cavalier compact
models. GM said those lines would be phased out to make room for the
new truck lines.
   Klipstine said decisions on employment, production speeds and the
length of retooling time for both plants is unknown. It is likely
that both plants will be shut down to refit machines to make the new
products.
   He said he did not know what Flint's new truck would be or when
it would be announced.
   ``Those are the kinds of things we won't know until we learn what
kind of product line is coming into Flint,'' he said. ``We're
talking about something that's going to happen in 1991.''
   The Flint plant now produces 32 vehicles an hour and made about
136,000 vehicles in 1988. In April, it will begin production of crew
cab and cab chassis light-duty truck models now being made in
Janesville.

   Barbie and G.I. Joe had birthday parties this
week. Mr. Game Show couldn't make it.
   ``He died,'' said Walter Kirchberger, a toy company analyst.
   Weep not, though, for Mr. Show. Of the estimated 5,000 games and
toys being introduced at the toy industry's annual coming-out party
in Manhattan this week, the vast majority will join him in that big
toybox in the sky.
   ``You'll see a lot of products at the Toy Fair this week that you
won't see next year,'' said Harold Vogel, another industry analyst.
``Most toys do not make it into a second season.''
   One reason: ``There's lots of junk.''
   But quality isn't the only criterion; some entries are undone
only by outrageous circumstance. ``The Evel Knievel doll did very
well when it came out. Then it just fell apart,'' said Vogel, of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. He guessed that Knievel's 1977 guilty plea in a
baseball-bat assault didn't help the toy.
   Plain poor judgment kills other entries. Consider the ill-starred
Golden Girl and the Guardian of the Gemstones. ``One of the biggest
stiffs in the history of the business,'' its manufacturer, David
Galoob, said Monday.
   ``The concept was action figures for little girls,'' said Galoob,
chief of Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. ``There were 12 beautiful female
warriors with shields and swords. The trade bought in very, very
heavily.
   ``And what we discovered was that little girls didn't want to
play with warrior figurines.''
   Other casualties of the toy wars are harder to explain. Barbie
turns 30 years old this week, dancing on the grave of a pretender
named Gem. While G.I. Joe marches on at 25, the Inhumanoids _ a
toady group from the center of the Earth _ withered in the light of
day.
   Why?
   Nobody knows.
   ``That is the $64 million question in the toy industry. And in
most other industries,'' said Kirchberger, of Paine Webber Group
Inc. ``Nobody sets out to make a bad movie. It just happens. It's
the same thing with toys.''
   Manufacturers are willing to enter the fray in hopes of capturing
a chunk of the $12.8 billion annual toy business. They trim losses
by making models of most new toys, holding back on full-scale
production until orders come in.
   Still, there have been some epic bombs. View-Master Ideal Group
Inc. is still scratching its head over Michael Jackson's Zoo, a
menagerie of stuffed animals inspired by the rock star's
predilection for offbeat pets.
   ``He even went on tour with his chimp. So we tried,'' said
View-Master's Jeremy Jacobs. ``We had the chimp appearing in stores
in Southern California. We had quite a few good promotions, but we
just couldn't move the product.''
   Then there was Mr. Game Show, a big hit at last year's Toy Fair,
a goner now. Kirchberger gave the eulogy:
   ``It was modeled after a TV game show; there was a figure of a
host, he spoke, he'd ask you questions, you'd push buttons to
indicate your answer, he'd tell you if you were right or wrong and
how much you won.
   ``Very clever. Wrong price point, wrong I-don't-know-what. Mr.
Game Show didn't make it.''

   The dollar finished lower against most major
currencies Monday in thin trading as players awaited the next round
of U.S. economic reports.
   Gold prices also declined. Republic National Bank of New York
said gold bullion was bid at $385.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST,
down from $387 late Friday.
   The dollar advanced in the Far East and continued rising later in
European trading, buoyed by expectations of higher U.S. interest
rates. The dollar later retreated in New York.
   Dealers said last Friday's report of a greater-than-expected 1
percent rise in U.S. wholesale prices in January had rekindled
speculation that the Federal Reserve would hike its discount rate
soon in an effort to help curb inflation by slowing the economy. But
the absence of a rate boost took away the market's excuse to drive
the dollar still higher, traders said.
   The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans to
financial institutions.
   ``We didn't see a lot of business moving through today,'' said
Robert Hatcher, vice president of corporate currency trading at the
New York office of Barclays Bank PLC of Britain. ``It's a case of a
market that's waiting for additional economic data before it moves.''
   Market participants are awaiting the publication of Tuesday's
report on retail sales for January, Wednesday's report on business
inventories and factory use for December, Thursday's report on
January housing starts and Friday's report on the December
merchandise trade deficit.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.65 Japanese yen to a closing 128.30 yen. Later in
London, the dollar was quoted at 128.60 yen and by the end of
trading in New York the dollar was quoted at 128.07 yen, down from
128.68 yen late Friday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7495 from $1.7547 on
Friday. Later in New York, sterling advanced to $1.7525 from $1.7467
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8677 West German marks, down from 1.8695; 1.5877
Swiss francs, down from 1.5885; 6.3575 French francs, down from
6.3588; 1,359.00 Italian lire, down from 1,363.50; and 1.1860
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8705 West German marks, up from 1.8595; 1.5895
Swiss francs, up from 1.5778; 6.3650 French francs, up from 6.3200;
2.1120 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0960; 1,362.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,353.75; and 1.1868 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1857.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $384.25 a troy ounce from
$391 bid late Friday. In Zurich, the late bid for gold was $383.75,
down from $389.50 bid late Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $6.80 an ounce to close at a bid
of $387.05.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
declined to $386.20 a troy ounce from $388.80 late Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid of $5.79 a troy ounce, down
from Friday's late bid of $5.85. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery rose to $5.826 a troy ounce from $5.812 late Friday.

   Copper futures prices dropped steeply on Monday, punctuating a
weeks-long decline following reports that an increase in inventories
at the London Mercantile Exchange was two or three times larger than
traders had anticipated.
   On other markets, crude oil futures climbed higher despite
rumblings of increased production by both Iran and the United Arab
Emirates; grain and soybean futures prices slipped lower after
favorable weather swept the South American growing regions of
Argentina and Brazil over the weekend; and gold dipped slightly as
traders anticipated the Federal Reserve Board might nudge interest
rates higher to fight inflation.
   On Monday, copper futures settled 1.6 cents to 5.45 cents lower
on the New York Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery
in March at $1.2825 a pound.
   The spot March contract for copper futures peaked at $1.5190 a
pound nearly four weeks ago and has declined steadily since as
supply tightness has eased and labor problems in the key producing
nations of Chile and Peru have been resolved.
   ``Any time inventories rise, it's bad news. But the trade was
looking for a rise in stocks of between 1,000 and 3,000 tons at the
LME, and what they saw was somewhere in the neighborhood of 7,300
instead,'' said John O'Connell of Refco Inc. ``That put some
downside pressure on the market.''
   Crude oil futures rose in the wake of a big decline late last
week, but traders said there was little news to explain the runup.
   ``There's really no news and the vague blurbs we did here _ that
Iran was increasing production, that the UAE would be above quota
next month _ both were actually bearish,'' said Jim Ritterbusch,
vice president-trading and research for Carson Petroleum Co. in
Chicago.
   ``I think most of the buying today might have come because the
market didn't break,'' he said. ``And it points up that we're in a
choppy, sideways market, casting around for some real news.''
   Crude oil settled 21 cents to 48 cents higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with March at $17.59 a barrel; heating oil was
.81 cent to .86 cent higher, with March at 48.17 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was unchanged to .58 cent higher, with March at
48.15 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices came under pressure from the
opening bell at the Chicago Board of Trade and never recovered. Dale
Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Chicago said reports of
rain in South America helped depress prices.
   Without any significant export business announcements, prices in
the wheat and corn pits slid lower in sympathy.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.25\ a bushel; corn was } cent to 1\ cents
lower, with March at $2.65\ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2} cents
lower, with March at $2.04\ a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cent to 12
cents lower, with March at $7.24 a bushel.
   Gold futures continued trending lower, although silver and
platinum posted moderate gains.
   Gold settled $2 to $2.60 lower on the Comex, with February at
$386.20 a troy ounce; silver rose 1.1 cent to 1.5 cents, with
February at $5.826 a troy ounce. Platinum was 80 cents to $1.70
cents higher at the New York Mercantile Exchange, with March at
$525.80 a troy ounce.
   Livestock futures were mixed to mostly higher, while pork futures
were mixed to mostly lower at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .52 higher, with February at
74.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .60 cent higher,
with March at 82.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower to
.12 cent higher, with February at 41.42 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .43 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with February
at 38.05 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   President Bush opened a campaign for his
``sensible ideas'' federal budget Monday in New Hampshire, the state
that revived his flagging campaign for the presidency one year
earlier.
   Although Bush's fiscal 1990 budget is under attack among
congressional Democrats for lacking specifics on spending cuts, Bush
gave no hint in his speech to the Business and Industry Association
of New Hampshire that the plan might be in trouble.
   ``Sensible ideas work,'' the president told a Manchester, N.H.,
audience of about 1,200 people. ``We can do the job without taxes,''
added Bush, who has repeatedly promised to fight any new taxes.
   However, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., who hitched a ride back to
Washington with Bush on Air Force One, told reporters a tax increase
of some form might be needed next year.
   ``No promise is forever,'' Rudman said. He predicted ``a good
three months of heavy slugging'' on the budget.
   The president said his appearance was only the first in a series
of stops around the country on behalf of his $1.16 trillion spending
plan, which calls for restraints on defense spending but more money
for education, environmental cleanup, the homeless and other
domestic programs.
   On Wednesday, Bush will fly to Columbia, S.C., to address a joint
session of the state Legislature. On Friday, he is expected to speak
in St. Louis.
   On Monday, Bush attended the swearing in of his Housing and Urban
Development secretary, former Rep. Jack Kemp.
   Bush told a roomful of HUD employees he is ``committed to equal
housing opportunity for all our citizens,'' and ``strong enforcement
of laws to end discrimination.''
   He said he wanted to change the ``misguided policies'' that had
seen ``whole neighborhoods boarded up'' and reiterated his support
for full funding of the so-called McKinney Bill to help combat
homelessness.
   Kemp, who said home ownership is the ``most vivid symbol of the
American Dream,'' pledged to help lead ``an all out public and
private effort to help end the appalling tragedy of homelessness.''
   Kemp said there will be two ``touchstones,'' of HUD, the first
``to adhere to the very highest standards of integrity, ethics and
the law.''
   ``Second, we all must keep our minds, our work and our hearts
focused on those we are meant to serve _ not just the home builder,
but the home buyer; not only public housing authorities, but the
public housing resident; not just mayors and city managers, but the
poor and those who live temporarily on the streets or in shelters.''
   Meantime, on Capitol Hill, Bush's budget director Richard Darman
met for nearly two hours with the chairman of the House and Senate
budget committees. He rejected criticism of the Bush budget by those
complaining it didn't spell out every detail of where cuts might be
made.
   ``We recognize in the end we have to negotiate with the
Congress,'' he said. Details left unspecified were those not as
important to the president, and the new administration wants to
demonstrate ``we're not rigid,'' he said.
   ``I think the White House is being more conciliatory,'' compared
to the Reagan White House, said Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman
of the Senate Budget Committee.
   About $9.6 billion in domestic spending cuts were not specified
in the Bush budget, Darman said last week.
   Asked about taxes after Monday's meeting, he said: ``The subject
didn't come up at our meeting.''
   Sasser said Darman will meet again Tuesday with him and Reps.
Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. Panetta is
chairman of the House Budget Committee and Foley the House Majority
Leader.
   The participants all said the meetings are akin to briefings and
not negotiations _ something the congressional leadership has not
yet agreed to begin.
   Bush stopped in Manchester, N.H., on the way back to Washington
from a vacation weekend at his seaside retreat in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   He had grateful words for New Hampshire and its voters, saying
his victory in the state's Republican primary on Feb. 16, 1988,
``gave me the chance to pick myself up off of that canvas.''
   Reminiscing about the campaign, Bush said: ``A year ago about
this time I came to New Hampshire under quite different
circumstances. I had just lost in Iowa. I was up at 6:50 a.m., my
first morning here, holding my coffee in one hand and shaking the
hands of some of the guys at the factory with the other.''
   ``The columnists had begun to write my political obituary,'' he
added.
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg joked that he wanted to extend to
Bush a ``welcome back on his regular February visit.'' Former New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, now Bush's chief of staff, was seated
behind Bush on the stage.
   Turning to his budget proposal, Bush said, ``Our plan is a
realistic one. It is a budget plan that will work, but not with
business as usual. It will require a partnership with Congress.''
   Bush's speech highlighted most major features of his budget plan.
However, he did not mention one of its more controversial components
_ a reduction of the tax on capital gains, which include profits
from the sale of stock, homes, real estate and other assets.
   He contends such a tax break would actually raise revenues by
spurring business investment, however Democratic critics have called
it a tax benefit mostly for the rich and have disputed the claim of
increased revenues.
   As he had in his first major policy speech to Congress last
Thursday night, Bush promised ``to work day and night'' with
Congress in coming to agreement on a plan that meets budget targets.
   ``There are some areas in which we would all like to spend more,
but we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order and bring the
deficit down,'' Bush said.

   Federal regulators took control of Midwest
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association on Monday amid an FBI
investigation of two of the executives of the thrift, Minnesota's
second-largest.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines declared Midwest Federal
insolvent and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as its
conservator under an interagency program announced by President Bush
last week.
   It was the 11th savings and loan in the country to fall under the
intervention program, aimed at stemming the tide of losses in the
nation's thrift industry.
   Midwest Federal Chairman Harold Greenwood Jr. and its managing
officer, Charlotte Massica, were named last week by U.S. Attorney
Jerome Arnold of Minneapolis as among the targets of an FBI
investigation into possible fraud at Midwest Federal.
   Greenwood, Massica and two other Midwest Federal officials
resigned Monday, federal officials said.
   Asked if the four executives had been fired, spokesman Hassan
Honarmand of the Des Moines home-loan bank said: ``You draw your own
conclusions. The new management team wanted to make a fresh start.''
   Honarmand did say, however, that auditors for the Des Moines bank
had not uncovered any illegalities at Midwest Federal.
   Honarmand said Greenwood and other Midwest Federal executives
were cooperative. Greenwood, who has an unlisted home telephone
number, could not be reached for comment.
   Greenwood in the past has denied any wrongdoing by himself or any
other any officer or employee of Midwest Federal.
   Thurman C. Connell, president of the Des Moines bank, said
Midwest Federal will continue to operate normally while federal
regulators determine the extent of its financial difficulties and
devise a plan to solve them.
   Martha Gravlee, deputy director of communications for the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, said ``the most likely scenario'' for rescuing
the thrift would include the use of federal funds.
   Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad has proposed acquiring Midwest
Federal with federal assistance, while others also have expressed
interest in bidding for the thrift.
   Midwest Federal has $3.4 billion in assets and $2.3 billion in
deposits.
   According to the Des Moines bank, Monday's action was
precipitated by a report from auditors that in the fourth quarter of
1988, Midwest Federal lost about $200 million from loans it
purchased from Green Tree Acceptance Corp., a former Midwest Federal
subsidiary.
   Green Tree's chief financial officer, John Brink, said in an
interview Monday that he didn't understand how Midwest Federal could
lose that amount on the loan package.
   ``It certainly isn't fair to blame all of Midwest Federal's
problems on Green Tree Acceptance,'' Brink said.
   Honarmand said the full amount of red ink at Midwest Federal will
not be known until an audit of 1988's books is complete in a few
weeks.

<HEAD>Security Forces Remove Strikers from Steel Mill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security agents at a steel mill
evicted several hundred strikers Monday to stop them from harassing
people who continued working, official media and sources in the area
reported.
   At least 1,000 people, most of them blast-furnace workers, walked
off their jobs Sunday at the mill in Zenica. They demanded double
wages for January compared with December, higher wages for night
work and other special payments because of inflation now at an
annual rate of about 300 percent.
   Several hundred Zenica workers marched to the town hall Sunday to
press their demands.
   Tanjug, the official news agency, said ``the mill's security
forces evicted...several hundred'' strikers Monday evening who were
involved in minor skirmishes with people who stayed on the job.
   Its report was brief and did not say whether anyone was injured.
It was believed to be the first such action by factory authorities
in communist Yugoslavia.
   Sources said on condition of anonymity that no one was seriously
injured. They said security men ``literally pushed the strikers out
of the factory gates.''
   Tanjug said mill authorities responded to ``the improper and
rowdy behavior of some strikers which endangered the security of the
people and the installations at the mill.''
   The agency said the situation in the plant 90 miles southwest of
Belgrade became ``volatile'' when management announced Monday
afternoon that it would not give in to the strikers' demands, Tanjug
said.
   Belgrade television said the factory produced 400 tons of steel
less on Monday than in a usual day. It also showed some of the
skirmishes between strikers and workers.
   About 22,000 people work at the mill, which was built after World
War II and served as a symbol of communist industrial development
until it began losing money in recent years.
   Nearly 2,000 strikes were reported in Yugoslavia last year, most
of them to protest lower living standards brought about by the
nation's severe economic problems.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange charged Monday
that journalists covering a federal trading-fraud investigation had
``trampled upon and smeared the integrity'' of the world's two
largest futures exchanges.
   The Merc's Board of Governors said in a statement that the
disclosure of the probe on Jan. 19 had sparked a ``media frenzy''
that had inflicted possibly irreversible damage on the futures
industry.
   ``The unbridled race by some in the media to print and broadcast
the most sensational and outlandish scrap of information has
resulted in a denigration of all traders, regardless of guilt or
innocence,'' the exchange said.
   ``Most importantly, it has viciously trampled upon and smeared
the integrity of two Chicago institutions...their officials and
their members in a manner that is unconscionable,'' the exchange
said.
   The statement was signed by Merc Chairman John Geldermann and
Merc Executive Committee Chairman Leo Melamed.
   The Merc said neither it nor the rival Chicago Board of Trade
were targets of the investigation.
   The probe is believed to be focused on allegations that as many
as 100 traders and brokers at the two exchanges systematically
cheated customers out of millions of dollars in profits on contracts
for future deliveries of commodities ranging from soybeans to
Treasury bonds.
   Federal authorities in Chicago have refused to comment on the
investigation. No indictments have yet been issued.
   The Merc said it would hold meetings this week to update members
on its comprehensive review of the exchange's trading rules and
practices. The review, launched in reaction to news of the
investigation, is not slated for completion until at least late
March.

   Hertz Corp. said Monday it will offer phones

   The credit-card phones will be supplied by GTE Cellular

   The other major car rental companies also offer cellular phones
in selected cities, but Hertz spokesman Joseph M. Russo said he
believed Hertz was the first one to offer cellular phones that have
slots to accept credit cards.
   Other car rental companies charge for use of their mobile phones
by keeping track of the calls that are made from the phone number

   Charges for the Hertz phones are billed directly to the
customer's credit card.
   Hertz also said it will offer portable phones at 14 rental

<HEAD>Market Indicates Semiconductor Demand Increasing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Market figures for January indicate
semiconductor demand is increasing for the first time in four months
and that the contracting market may be slightly reversing itself,
analysts said Monday.
   An increase in U.S. semiconductor orders caused a rise in the
closely watched ``book-to-bill'' ratio for January, which reached
1.0, according to figures released by the Semiconductor Industry
Association. The figure was .93 in December.
   A book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 means that for every $100 worth of
products billed, manufacturers received $100 worth of new orders, or
bookings.
   The total shipments, or billings, of $1.004 million in January
were 10.9 percent higher than the same figure a year ago and 17.1
percent lower than in December.
   The January 1989 orders, or bookings, of $1.124 million were 5.8
percent higher than the average bookings posted last year and 5.4
percent higher than December's figure.
   ``It means the industry is coming back toward a growth
environment after four months with less than a one-to-one (ratio),
indicating a shrinking of the market and people buying less from
September to now,'' said Mel Phelps, of the Hambrecht &amp; Quist
investment company.
   ``This indicates for the first time they are beginning to order
as much as is being produced,'' he said.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ E.A. Horrigan Jr., chairman of the
board of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. since 1980 and an unsuccessful
player in the bid to buy out RJR Nabisco Inc., said Monday he will
resign from the company effective March 1.
   Horrigan said he will continue to assist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co., the new owners of RJR Nabisco, the tobacco company's parent
company, during the transition period until his successor is named.
   ``KKR has made it very clear that they recognize the strength of
our tobacco operations and their position as the core of RJR
Nabisco's business, and that their intention is to be a partner in
moving R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. ahead,'' he said.
   In October 1988, Horrigan and RJR Nabisco President F. Ross
Johnson announced that executives of the food and tobacco giant were
considering taking the company private in a leveraged buyout worth
almost $17 billion.
   Kohlberg won the bidding war on Nov. 30 with a bid valued at $109
a share, or $25.1 billion. Johnson resigned as president and chief
executive officer last week when Kohlberg took control.
   Horrigan joined R.J. Reynolds in July 1978 as chairman and chief
executive officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc. He was
elected to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. board of directors in April
1979. He became chairman, president and chief executive officer of
the company in February 1980.
   Horrigan was elected to the board of directors of R.J. Reynolds
Industries, now RJR Nabisco, in December 1980, and was named
executive vice president of the parent company in September 1981. He
was elected president and chief operating officer of R.J. Reynolds
Industries in 1984 and became vice chairman of its board in 1985.

<HEAD>Affiliated Publications Reports $29 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Affiliated Publications Inc. said Monday it lost
$29.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1988 and $80.8 million for
the year, largely due to its share of a telecommunications firm's
losses.
   Affiliated, parent company of The Boston Globe, said it owns more
than 61 million shares of McCaw Cellular Communications of Kirkland,
Wash. Affiliated's share of McCaw's fourth-quarter loss totaled
$43.7, eliminating the $14.2 million in profit the company earned
from its other operations.
   For the fourth quarter, losses were $29.5 on revenue of $137
million, compared with a loss of $3.6 million on revenue of $135.6
million for the same period last year.
   Losses for all of 1988 totaled $80.9 million on revenue of $534.2
million, compared with earnings of $201.2 million, or $2.87 a share,
on revenue of $490.1 million in 1987.
   On Jan. 19, Affiliated and McCaw announced a restructuring under
which Affiliated will distribute its Globe Newspaper Co. and
Billboard Publications Inc. subsidiaries to its shareholders in a
tax-free spinoff.
   Immediately after the spinoff, Affiliated will merge with McCaw.
The restructuring is pending approval of shareholders and federal
regulators.
   Affiliated also is the parent company of Globe Pequot Press, a
book publisher.
   McCaw is one of the largest cellular telephone systems operators
in the United States and one of the nation's top paging operators.

Chairman Paul Volcker and current Chairman Alan Greenspan, will be a
partner in the Cleveland-based firm's financial institutions section

<HEAD>Six Relatives of Hamburger Chain Founder Settle Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal insider-trading case against six
relatives of the founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain was
settled Monday when the defendants agreed to pay fines and
restitution totaling $187,560.
   Chief among those settling Monday was Donald F. Karcher, brother
of chain founder Carl N. Karcher and president of Carl Karcher
Enterprises Inc., which runs 460 Carl's Jr. restaurants in the West.
   Neither he nor any of the other defendants admitted guilt in
settling the Securities and Exchange Commission case in U.S.
District Court. All were ordered to refrain from future securities
violations, according to an SEC announcement on the settlement.
   An assistant to Donald Karcher said Karcher had no immediate
comment on the settlement.
   The government's civil complaint alleged that Carl N. and Donald
Karcher and their wives tipped relatives and in-laws to an expected
dip in the company's stock price in 1984, and that the relatives
sold stock to avoid losses totaling $310,000.
   It is against securities law to take advantage of information
unavailable to the general investing public when trading stock.
   Carl N. Karcher, chairman of the Anaheim-based company and its
spokesman in homey commercials touting traditional American values,
remains a defendant in the case. So do his wife, six other relatives
and an employee.

   Reality and make-believe mingled Monday at the
annual American International Toy Fair as hundreds of toymakers
touted their 1989 offerings to buyers from stores around the country.
   As usual, many manufacturers recruited colorful characters to
catch the eyes of buyers and grab some free publicity.
   A rifle-toting George Bush lookalike hawking a new board game was
only a few feet from authentic protesters airing gripes against war
toys, while real-life Olympic star Florence Griffith Joyner pitched
a new ``Flo Jo'' doll and developer Donald Trump made a
publicity-seeking appearance on behalf of a new board game bearing
his name.
   Nearby on the Fifth Avenue sidewalk, a unicycle-riding clown and
a life-sized green turtle _ that's human life, not amphibian life _
were among the crowd patrolled by police.
   The doyen of fashion dolls had a gala all her own Monday night. A
shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front of Lincoln Center for
1,200 guests attending Barbie's ``Pink Jubilee.''
   Several stage and television celebrities paid tribute to Barbie
during a show commemorating her 30 years as a successful doll. New
York Mayor Edward Koch sent her some fan mail.
   ``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes
her a great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from
its unparalleled ethnic diversity,'' Koch wrote in his letter.
   Elaborate promotions have become a tradition at Toy Fair, where
each year an estimated 5,000 new toys debut. Countless items on
display here will never make it to store shelves and many
much-touted toys of 1988 were absent as the 10-day trade show opened
its doors Monday.
   Amid all the hoopla, the industry reported business improved
modestly in 1988 after several disappointing years.
   ``I believe I speak for many in the industry who feel encouraged
by the performance of manufacturers in the past 12 months and are
optimistic about prospects for the future,'' said Thomas J.
Kalinske, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc.
   One of the best omens is that publicly-held toy companies seem to
have reversed their bad fortunes of 1987, Kalinske said at a news
conference.
   Together, those companies lost about $120 million in 1987. Last
year, the same companies probably earned profits of around $120
million, according to the trade association.
   Retail toy sales rose to an estimated $12.75 billion in 1988 from
$12.5 billion in 1987. The association's figures don't include the
roughly $2.3 billion in revenue for video games last year, most of
which are foreign made.
   Although retail toy sales were virtually flat, the industry
reported a 3.9 percent pickup in sales at the wholesale level.
Manufacturers' shipments rose to $8.55 billion from $8.23 billion.
   Another good sign is that retailers are finding more customers
shopping for toys all year, instead of only during the pre-Christmas
buying binge, Kalinske said.
   A perennial problem for toymakers has been the reliance of their
balance sheets on seasonal shopping: if economic activity
temporarily falls off ahead of Christmas and causes consumers to
spend cautiously, toy makers' revenues are endangered.
   In an effort to coax customers into buying toys throughout the
year, manufacturers have emphasized items that appeal to adults as
well as children. Sociologists say this an astute marketing strategy
because families increasingly seemed to be staying home and engaging
in group activities.
   Last year's popular games such as Pictionary, or previous
successes such as Trivial Pursuit, benefited from this trend.
   Manufacturers also have had to account for the aging of the U.S.
population, which is shrinking the market for children-only toys.
   But among the biggest challenge for the U.S. toy industry is
competition from video games, by far the biggest selling items over
the past two years.
   While stores have reaped handsome returns from video games such
as the Nintendo game system, the sales steered money away from other
toys, mostly boys items.
   But some observers think that will change.
   ``I think the fad is concentrated with boys, ages 6 to 15, and
it's my belief that segment is saturated,'' said toy analyst Paul
Valentine of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.

<HEAD>New Coal Fields Worth $2.56 Billion Found In Malaysia, Says Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German team has found two
coal deposits containing about 93 million tons of coal worth an
estimated $2.56 billion, it was reported Tuesday.
   The two deposits were found in the Tebulan and Merit South areas
of Sarawak state, The New Straits Times reported, quoting S.P. Chen,
Sarawak's Geological Survey Department director. The coal is of the
sub-bituminous type suitable for industrial use as fuel.
   The new areas are adjacent to the existing Merit Pila coal field,
180 miles northeast of Kuching, which was discovered last April and
has about 63.7 million tons of coal worth more than $1.72 billion,
Chen said.
   Chen said the discovery was part of a $1.1 million-dollar survey
being conducted by seven West German geologists since 1983. The
seven are in Sarawak as part of a German technical aid program that
ends in 1990.
   Chen said there were about 78 million tons of coal in the Tebulan
area and 15 million tons in Merit South.
   Commercial mining at the Merit Pila coal field began last June by
the United States-based Global Mineral Exploration Corp. and a
Malaysian-South Korean joint venture, Lucky Hill Ltd, Chen said.
   Global was expected to produce 350,000 tons annually and Lucky
Hill 120,000 tons. So far, Global has produced 29,500 tons and Lucky
Hill 20,500 tons. The coal is being exported to Taiwan and Japan.
