   Congress Wednesday sent President Bush a $3.45
billion relief package, the largest ever for a single disaster, to
help Northern Californians rebuild homes, businesses and roads
shattered by last week's earthquake.
   Final approval in the House came on a vote of 303-107, hours
after the Senate voted its consent 97-1. The Senate had sweetened a
$2.85 billion version of the bill passed Tuesday by the House by
making an additional $600 million of Small Business Administration
disaster loans available to companies hurt by the quake.
   ``This is a tremendous amount of good will,'' Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., who helped lead his state congressional delegation's
efforts to win federal aid, told his colleagues. ``We thank all of
you.''
   White House spokesman Robert Hall said Bush would sign the bill
first thing Thursday morning. That was virtually a necessity,
largely because the measure was attached to legislation allowing
the government to continue functioning through its latest fiscal
crisis.
   Even though the government's authority to spend money
technically expired at midnight, all federal employees were to
report to work as usual on Thursday morning, Hall said.
   The assistance was directed at what appears to have been the
costliest natural disaster in American history, with damage
estimates now exceeding $7.1 billion. The Oct. 17 quake _ measured
at 7.1 on the Richter scale _ killed 63 people, with 9 unaccounted
for, 3,000 injured, and nearly 14,000 homeless.
   The earthquake measure comes on the heels of a $1.1 billion
relief package approved last month to help victims of Hurricane
Hugo, the previous federal assistance record for a single disaster.
   ``It is very likely that the ultimate federal cost ... may be
higher as the damage estimates continue to grow,'' warned Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif. ``But this is a very good, very important
allocation for a community that has been very badly shaken.''
   The aid was part of a must-pass bill to keep federal agencies in
business for the next three weeks. Because only two of the 13
annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 have been enacted, the
government's authority to spend money would otherwise expire at
midnight Wednesday. Fiscal 1990 began Oct. 1.
   The earthquake relief portion provides $1.1 billion for housing,
families' losses, damaged public property and other assistance
through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   It makes available $1 billion for highway and bridge repair,
creates a $250 million fund for Bush to distribute, and pours an
additional $500 million into the SBA's emergency loan pot, which
previously contained $1 billion. It also increases by $600 million,
to a total of $1.8 billion, the maximum amount of emergency loans
which the SBA is authorized to make.
   Though the SBA would start with about $1.5 billion in its
emergency pool, it could issue loans up to the $1.8 billion figure
as the pool is replenished by repayments.
   ``People who are dislocated from their homes and businesses need
that assistance now,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   At the insistence of California lawmakers, the measure also
clears away several bureaucratic hurdles that would have restricted
the assistance. It makes the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge,
where a section of road collapsed, eligible for federal assistance.
Because it is a toll road, it would not have otherwise qualified.
   It also extends from 90 to 180 days the period in which
California would not have to provide state funds to be eligible for
federal assistance.
   In addition, $20 million of the funds would be used to study
earthquakes and techniques to prepare for them.
   The quake was centered on the San Andreas fault, in the Santa
Cruz Mountains 56 miles south of San Francisco.
   Some money in the bill could be used to help victims of Hugo and
about 19 other disaster areas that still qualify for federal
assistance. The lion's share, however, is intended for victims of
the earthquake.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., cast the sole vote against the
bill in the Senate, saying he did so because it exceeded the $2.5
billion sought by the administration and would fuel the nation's
deficit. Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
did not vote.

<DATELINE>CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State prison inmates took eight guards
hostage and set four fires in a seven-hour riot touched off when a
prisoner assaulted a staff worker, officials said. At least 42
people, mostly prison employees, were injured.
   The disturbance at the medium-security State Correctional
Institute at Camp Hill began at 3 p.m. and ended shortly before 11
p.m., Superintendent Robert Freeman said.
   ``The incident at Camp Hill is over. We are fully in control of
the institution,'' he said.
   The injured included 35 guards or staff people, five inmates,
including one who had been stabbed with a screwdriver, one
firefighter and one state trooper, said John Palakovich, assistant
to the prison superintendent.
   The hostages were released by 9 p.m., but prison officials did
not say how long they had been held.
   Formal negotiations between the inmates, who carried home-made
weapons, and a team of prison guards began at 6 p.m. and the first
hostages were released at 8 p.m., Freeman said.
   The inmates had demanded a press conference, changes in medical
care and family visit rules and amnesty, Freeman said. In response
to the demands, the superintendent said he plans to meet with a
group of inmates on Wednesday.
   Freeman said some of the hostages had been beaten and received
medical treatment, but he had no details on their condition.
   All cell blocks were secure and all but one fire was
extinguished by 10 p.m., Palakovich said.
   Palakovich said the disturbance began after a staff member was
assaulted by an inmate at the E gatehouse. The incident carried
over to two nearby cellblock areas. Fires were started at the
prison furniture factory, a commissary and another food service
area, Palakovich said.
   A reporter for The Patriot-News said she saw a number of inmates
try to crash a truck through a rear gate. There was no official
confirmation of that account, but witnesses said the truck did not
get through the fence.
   Freeman said the riot was apparently ignited by inmate anger
over a recent prison ban on inmates' families bringing in homemade
food, out of fears it was being used to hide contraband.
   The prison has 2,607 inmates, about 45 percent over capacity.
The 52-acre complex about three miles from Harrisburg was opened in
1941 as a youth detention center and converted to adult population
in 1976.
   The Camp Hill riot came only two days after a disturbance at the
Huntingdon state prison injured 29 staff members and 19 prisoners.
Inmates took over a cellblock Monday night for three hours,
breaking windows, destroying furniture and setting several small
fires, authorities said. Huntingdon is about 100 miles west of Camp
Hill.
   State Police Deputy Commissioner Glenn Walp said 200 troopers
from several barracks had been sent to help quell the disturbance
at Camp Hill.
   Eight people, including six guards, a prison worker and a state
trooper, were taken to Harrisburg Hospital, said spokeswomen Claire
Powers. Four of the patients were released. Martin Wilhelm, 46, of
Harrisburg, a prison guard, was admitted with an eye injury in fair
condition.
   Fifteen prison employees were taken to Holy Spirit Hospital in
Camp Hill with minor lacerations and one broken ankle, according to
spokeswoman Tamara Reisinger. Fourteen were treated and released.
   Two patients were transported by helicopter to the Milton S.
Hershey Medical Center, where spokeswoman Deborah Saline said both
were in fair condition. One patient, a guard, had injuries to the
face, eye, ear and blows to the chest, Ms. Saline said. The other
was an inmate who had a stab wound to the shoulder, she said.
   One guard was in intensive care at Community General Osteopathic
Hospital with multiple injuries, said Nancy Witkowski, nursing
supervisor.

   Outrage grew Wednesday over the robbery-killing of
a pregnant suburban lawyer and the wounding of her husband, while
their baby born by Caesarean section struggled for survival.
   In housing developments, in posh hotels, in student haunts and
in the streets, the talk was of the attack on Carol Stuart and her
husband, Chuck, who were abducted as they left a childbirth class
at Brigham and Women's Hospital Monday night.
   Their assailant forced them to drive into the inner city area
bordering the hospital. There the assailant robbed the couple and
shot Stuart in the abdomen, his 33-year-old wife in the head.
   Stuart, 29, remained in critical condition Wednesday, a Boston
City Hospital spokesman said.
   Late in the day, Police Superintendent Joseph Saia said
detectives had been able to narrow the list of suspects ``down to a
chosen few'' after speaking to Stuart at his hospital bedside.
   More than 400 people gathered Wednesday evening for a memorial
Mass at a church in the same inner-city neighborhood were the
attack occurred.
   ``The community wanted to pray for the families. We thought a
Mass would be the best way to do that,'' said the Rev. Joseph
Krastel, rector of the Mission Roman Catholic Church.
   ``It hit home,'' Beryl Cohen, a prominent Boston attorney, said
Wednesday as he made his way through the downtown shopping
district, miles from the site of the crime. ``It's not a suburban
story. It's not about rich and poor. It's not made-for-television
fiction. I just called my son, who takes guitar lessons on Tremont
Street (near the shooting) and told him to be careful.''
   In the Mission Hill area, where police found the couple shot and
slumped in their car, 23-year old Anthony Stanley was standing
outside a liquor store with a friend Wednesday.
   ``The man who did it should be taken out. We got to get the
death penalty back. The guy was foul. He had no heart,'' said
Stanley.
   At a downtown cutlery store, proprietor Arthur Marks said his
employees could talk about nothing but the crime and its brutality.
   ``It's almost too hard to look,'' the 73-year-old merchant said,
``because of its enormity and the fact that it's so needless.''
   Chuck Stuart, 29-year-old general manager of a fur store, used a
car phone to call police. Family members said the telephone was
installed in Mrs. Stuart's car after she became pregnant so she
could remain in touch with her husband.
   Several hours after the shooting, a son, Christopher, was born.
The mother died shortly after the birth. Hospital spokeswomen would
only say Wednesday that the infant was alive. Family members said
the baby had suffered seizures and there was diminishing hope for
his survival.
   Neonatal experts said an infant delivered by Caesarean section
32 weeks after conception, as Christopher was, should have a 98
percent chance of surviving. But Mrs. Stuart's loss of blood in the
shooting was said to harm the child's chances.
   ``He looked perfect. They told us to stroke his face because
they said he would need a lot of love,'' Mrs. Stuart's aunt,
Rosemary Leone, said after seeing the baby. ``Carol had been having
a wonderful pregnancy. She wanted this baby so badly. But they
don't think there's much hope for him.''

   Here are descriptions of principals in
the Jim Bakker fraud and conspiracy trial in U.S. District Court:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>JIM BAKKER</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bakker, a Michigan native, dropped out of North Central Bible
College in Minneapolis after less than one year of study to marry
schoolmate Tammy Faye LaValley. He began his ministry as a
traveling evangelist in the Assemblies of God and was ordained in
1964. Bakker was host of a Christian television show for children,
which led to a regular puppet show on Pat Robertson's Christian
Broadcast Network in Virginia. Bakker started ``The 700 Club'' on
CBN but left the network and eventually landed in Charlotte in 1974
with a Christian talk show on a UHF station.
   He built the single station into the PTL satellite network,
which grew to a $129 million-a-year empire, relocated his ministry
in Fort Mill, S.C., just outside Charlotte, and built Heritage USA,
a Christian theme park.
   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after confessing
to a sexual encounter with New York church secretary Jessica Hahn.
He turned over PTL _ which stands for Praise The Lord or People
That Love _ to Jerry Falwell, who failed to keep it out of
bankruptcy court.
   He and his wife have two children, daughter Tammy Sue, who
married former PTL worker Doug Chapman in 1987, and son Jamie
Charles.

   Tammy Bakker became her husband's partner on the CBN puppet show
and was his co-host on PTL. She and Bakker separated briefly in
1981, and their reconciliation led to PTL marriage workshops at
Heritage USA.
   She was treated for drug dependency in 1986 as an outpatient at
the Betty Ford Center after becoming addicted to tranquilizers.
   A self-professed chronic shopper, she was known for her
sprawling closets at the PTL parsonage and her heavy hand with
make-up. Although she received substantial bonuses at PTL, she was
not indicted with her husband.
   Recently, she has been co-host of ''The Jim And Tammy Show,''
which originates in a rundown mall in Orlando, Fla., and is carried
on eight cable channels.

<TEXT>
   Bakker's second-in-command at PTL, Dortch was a former district
superintendent for the Assemblies of God in Illinois and was
considered a top candidate to head the denomination.
   Dortch, who joined PTL in 1984, negotiated the $265,000 hush
payment to Jessica Hahn and was fired at PTL after Jerry Falwell
took over in 1987. He was indicted with Bakker, but pleaded guilty
to four counts of conspiracy and fraud three weeks before their
trial. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined
$200,000, but his sentence could be reconsidered after Bakker's
trial.
   He was defrocked by the Assemblies of God along with Bakker in
1987 and later moved to Florida, where he started a counseling
ministry for executives facing personal crises.

<BYLINE>DAVID and JAMES TAGGART</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Detroit natives David and James Taggart, who both testified for
the prosecution at Bakker's trial, started as piano players with
PTL but soon moved up the ladder. David became Bakker's personal
assistant, handling travel arrangements and schedules, and served
as the bank for the PTL entourage whenever Bakker traveled. His
brother became PTL's interior designer.
   Prosecutors said the pair diverted more than $1 million in
ministry funds for their personal uses, including expensive
wardrobes, jewelry and a Manhattan apartment. They were convicted
in July of tax evasion. David was sentenced to 18 years, five
months and James to 17 years, nine months in prison. The brothers
were also fined $500,000 each.

   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller handled Bakker's case
through the grand jury and trial. He was joined by Deborah Smith, a
fraud expert with the U.S. Justice Department in Washington.

<BYLINE>THE DEFENSE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George C. Davis, relieved as defense lawyer Tuesday at his own
request so he could prepare for other cases, is a noted West Coast
attorney whose clients have included the late Prime Minister
Zulfikar Bhutto of Pakistan and Alfred Krupp, the German munitions
manufacturer who was convicted of war crimes at Nuremburg. Davis
has been the defense lawyer in more than 200 death penalty cases
and was one of the first lawyers to use hypnosis in a criminal
trial.
   Harold Bender, Bakker's second lawyer, is a former assistant
U.S. attorney from Charlotte and has served as defense lawyer in
several highly publicized local cases.

<BYLINE>THE JUDGE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, a conservative judge
nominated by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is known in courthouse
circles as ``Maximum Bob'' for the sentences he hands down. Potter
imposed a gag order on the case before it started, forbidding
anyone associated with the trial from discussing it outside the
courtroom. He frequently sparred with Davis during the trial,
warning him about his questions and comments before the jury.

   Uncertain times lie ahead for China's movie
industry, which faces new political constraints just as a
generation of young, ambitious directors strives to compete on
international screens.
   Like others in the art world, studio heads and directors are
waiting to see the full impact of the crackdown on liberalism that
has followed the June crackdown on student-led demonstrations for
democratic reform.
   The early signs have not been encouraging.
   The central government's Film Bureau, which supervises all
movies, has fired the head of the Beijing Film Studio for
unspecified political errors, and sent in a special team led by
bureau director Teng Jingxian to ``rectify'' the studio.
   Liu Cheng, in charge of censorship at the bureau, said he sent
``urgent telegrams'' this fall to China's two most innovative
studios, the Xian Film Studio in western China and the Pearl River
Film Studio in Canton, warning them to ``pay special attention to
problems in ideological tendencies.''
   Asked what that meant, Liu laughed and said, ``When they see
(the warning), they understand.''
   Film officials did not even try to select this year's best movie
in the Golden Rooster competition, China's politically charged
version of the Academy Awards. The selection was hard enough in
past years, when awards were sometimes delayed for months while
officials debated the political merits of films nominated for
artistic reasons. This year, officials said no movies were
acceptable.
   All studios, like other work units, have been ordered to hold
special classes to study recent Communist Party documents on the
battle against ``bourgeois liberalism,'' or anti-socialist ideas,
and the need for art to serve socialism.
   Liu said at the Film Bureau, the classes take up two half-days a
week _ far more than ordinary work units.
   Two of China's leading film directors were overseas when the
crackdown began, and one, Chen Kaige, has said he won't return. He
plans to make a documentary about the June army attack on Beijing
protesters, in which hundreds and possibly thousands were killed.
   The other, Xian studio head Wu Tianming, has not been in touch
with his studio since he left for Canada in April to attend the
opening of a joint Chinese-Canadian movie about China's first
emperor.
   Studio officials say they don't know if Wu will return, and Liu
acknowledged it was ``hard to say'' if Wu would be allowed to keep
his job if he did. Wu's blunt criticisms of government censors long
have gotten him in trouble, and his studio's movies have angered
some officials by depicting rural poverty and mindless bureaucracy.
   But the debt-ridden studio in arid, impoverished northern China
also has won more international prizes than any other studio,
beginning with Wu's 1987 ``Old Well,'' which won awards in Tokyo
and Hawaii.
   The movie's frank depiction of rural poverty and daring story of
a love triangle set off a small storm within the Chinese movie
industry, more accustomed to socialist morality tales.
   Young directors at other studios joined the movement to make
realistic movies of modern life, adopting film techniques from
abroad, and critics said China's film industry had finally matured.
   No movies of the new school have been released since the June
crackdown, only epics of the Communist revolution timed to
celebrate the 40th anniversary of its victory in October 1949.
   But Wang Jin, vice president of the Pearl River studio, said in
an interview that the Film Bureau recently approved a movie the
studio shot before June depicting smuggling and other illegal
activities.
   Last spring, Pearl River released what it billed as China's
``first sex movie,'' a story of love and marriage in a 1940s
fishing village. ``I think we can still make this kind of movie,''
Wang said.
   But the studio will no longer test the censors by sending them
love scenes it thinks likely to be cut _ it will make the cuts
itself, he said.
   Directors Yan Xueshu and Zhou Xiaowen at the Xian studio also
said they hope to continue their experimental work.
   ``Movements happen. We are used to them,'' Zhou said. If the
government insisted on changing a movie he made, he added boldly,
``I'd resign.''
   ``And start your own studio?'' Yan asked him sarcastically.

   Margaret Thatcher provokes
outrage, admiration, bewilderment, and few South Africans who
follow foreign affairs are neutral about the British prime minister.
   From the Commonwealth summit meeting in distant Malaysia this
week, Mrs. Thatcher consolidated her status as a dominant figure in
South Africa's political disputes.
   Her determined opposition to tougher economic sanctions against
South Africa was praised by conservative whites and denounced by
anti-apartheid leaders.
   ``Thank you, Maggie,'' said an editorial Tuesday in The Citizen,
a pro-government Johannesburg daily. ``We South Africans appreciate
your brave, honest and lone battle against sanctions.''
   President F.W. de Klerk, in a speech Monday night, lauded the
leader of Britain's Conservative Party and said intensified
sanctions would undermine his proposals for political reform.
   Murphy Morobe, a senior spokesman for the anti-apartheid
movement, said with understatement that Mrs. Thatcher's position
``does not coincide with ours.'' Moses Mayekiso, a black trade
union leader, said Mrs. Thatcher went to the summit ``to defend the
apartheid regime.''
   The 49-nation Commonwealth, composed of Britain and its former
colonies, adopted a declaration Sunday calling for tougher
financial measures against South Africa and giving the white-led
government six months to fulfill promises to dismantle apartheid.
   The declaration incorporated Mrs. Thatcher's objections but an
hour later, to the dismay of other participants, she issued a
separate statement outlining her reasons for dissent.
   She said tougher sanctions will hurt South Africa's blacks and
increase white resistance to de Klerk's reform program.
   On Tuesday she told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, ``I am in
step with the people of South Africa.''
   South Africa, a former British colony, withdrew from the
Commonwealth in 1961 as other members increased their demands that
it end its policies of racial separation.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg-based financial newspaper often
critical of the government, said Mrs. Thatcher performed more
honorably at Kuala Lumpur than two pro-sanctions advocates, Prime
Ministers Robert Hawke of Australia and Brian Mulroney of Canada.
   Hawke and Mulroney ``have found in South Africa a rare
opportunity for moral posturing,'' Business Day said. ``They don't
know or care what harm they do.''
   Mrs. Thatcher has ``the good sense to recognize fundamental
changes when they occur, sufficient faith in human nature to dare
to hope for better times, and the courage to back her judgment,''
the editorial said. ``That is why she towers over men like Hawke
and Mulroney; even if she turns out in the end to be wrong, at
least she is not a pygmy.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate residential districts, schools and health services.

   A century after the Vatican lost control of Rome,
politicians are accusing it of still trying to control the city's

   The charge stems from a speech by a top church administrator,
the papal vicar for Rome, suggesting that the city's voters choose
the Christian Democrats _ Italy's only church-linked party _ in
mayoral elections this weekend.
   The appeal by Cardinal Ugo Poletti has sparked a national outcry
about Roman Catholic Church involvement in Italian politics.
   ``We seem to have returned to the Rome of the popes,'' commented
Bettino Craxi, leader of the Socialist party.
   The debate underlines how powerful religion is considered even
in a city that appears overwhelmingly secular, with low Mass
attendance, porno movie houses and condom ads on buses. It has
overshadowed such pressing concerns as traffic, pollution, social
services and housing.
   Poletti came under attack particularly for saying voters should
make ``courageous'' choices ``even at the expense of personal
sacrifice or repugnance.''
   His statement was interpreted as calling for support for the
Christian Democrats despite the fact that successive city
governments led by the party have been embroiled in scandal.
   ``It is worrying ... that Cardinal Poletti invites people to
vote for the (Christian Democrats) even when they feel
repugnance,'' said Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small Republican
party.
   Since July, Rome has been run by a special commissioner named by
the national government after Christian Democrat Mayor Pietro
Giubilo resigned. Giubilo had been accused of steering contracts
for school lunches to friends. He denied he did anything wrong.
   While the elections are simply to choose a city council, which
in turn elects the mayor, they have major symbolic significance
both for the church and the Italian political parties.
   The Oct. 29-30 ballot is the first since the Christian Democrats
won back control of city hall in 1985 after nine years of rule by
the Communists, Italy's second-biggest party.
   The Vatican was embarrassed by Communist rule in the city of
popes and unhappy about several Communist policies, such as
extension of abortion services. Consequently it is anxious to see a
party espousing Catholic values returned to city hall.
   Political parties, meanwhile, see the Rome elections as a
barometer of their popularity nationwide and a chance to land a
high-profile post.
   The importance of the vote has prompted several parties to send
top politicians including Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian
Democrat, to stump for mayoral candidates. Craxi sailed down the
Tiber River to promote his man, Tourism Minister Franco Carraro.
   The Vatican controlled the city of Rome for 400 years until
Italian unification hero Giuseppe Garibaldi's troops entered the
city in 1870.
   But the church has long kept a hand in Italian politics, and its
support of the Christian Democrats has been credited with helping
keep the Communists out of national government for more than four
decades.
   Much of the church's traditional influence, however, has waned
in Italy as Western European society has become more secular.
   Less than 25 percent of the population attends Mass regularly in
the city that is the world center of Catholicism.
   Only about 72 percent of marriages in the Italian capital this
year were in church, even though around 90 percent of the
population calls itself Catholic, according to figures from city
hall and the Catholic organization Caritas.
   Still, the Catholic Church is considered a powerful political
force in the Eternal City.
   The Turin-based newspaper La Stampa recently surveyed the
strength of Rome's religious orders and lay Catholic organizations
and concluded they comprised around 60,000 people. Rome has 2.3
million eligible voters.
   More than 39 percent of Romans questioned in a survey in the
Italian newsmagazine Panorama felt Cardinal Poletti's appeal would
have ``a lot'' or ``some'' influence on the votes of Catholics.
   The latest controversy came as the Vatican has been sparring
with Christian Democrat politicians over conditions in the capital.
In February, Pope John Paul II urged city officials to stop
squabbling among themselves. He described Rome as a ``city of two
faces,'' where wealth and poverty exist side by side.
   Both Poletti and the Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano were
critical of Giubilo, the mayor who resigned.
   The fact that Poletti urged support for the party he had been
criticizing was not lost on politicians.

<HEAD>Retired People Help Disaster Agency Stretch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ann Smith likes to be where the action is
when disaster strikes.
   Bob Lytle's wife wanted him out of her kitchen.
   Both retired, they are reservists for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency who help the agency stretch when the pressure is
on.
   Last month they were helping victims of Hurricane Hugo. Now
they're pulling 12-hours shifts at the Veterans Memorial Building
in Oakland, where FEMA set up its disaster assistance center to
handle applications for grants and low-interest loans.
   Smith, 61, retired in June from the California Department of
Transportation office in Redding, but has been a FEMA reservist for
three years.
   Before she retired, she saved up vacation time to work disasters.
   ``It's an organization that's there quickly and we like to be
part of the action,'' said Smith, who is assistant manager of the
disaster assistance center here.
   Lytle, 78, of Tempe, Ariz., a retired associated professor of
agricultural engineering, has been a reservist 12 years.
   ``My wife said she married for better or worse, but not for
lunch,'' said Lytle. ``She wanted to know, `What are you going to
do to stay out of my kitchen?'''
   Until recently, neither one had been sent to a disaster in more
than a year and a half.
   On Sept. 1, Lytle was sent to Baton Rouge, La., to a flood.
Three weeks later, he was sent to Charleston, S.C., for Hurricane
Hugo. A day at home and he was in Oakland to help open an
earthquake disaster assistance center.
   Smith was packed and ready to go to the Grand Canyon on vacation
with her husband, Larry, another FEMA reservist now working in
Monterey County, when the call came Sept. 24 for Hugo.
   ``We split our clothes into two suitcases and off we went to
Puerto Rico,'' she said.
   Three weeks later, they both were sent to help out with the
quake.
   ``We had a beautiful spring and summer at home,'' she said. ``I
haven't been home at all this fall.''
   Both find getting their laundry done one of the biggest
challenges.
   ``If you go to a Laundromat, that's an hour you could be
sleeping,'' Lytle said.
   Coast-to-coast diasters have stretched FEMA, but it hasn't
snapped yet, said spokesman Bill McAda in Washington.
   ``I sure don't want to see it strained much more, though,''
McAda said. ``Right now I have laying on my desk a request for a
disaster declaration from the state of Kentucky,'' where flood
damages are estimated at $12 million, McAda said. ``We're about to
find out whether we can (meet more demands) or not.''
   The agency has 3,000 people assigned to Hurricane Hugo and the
California earthquake, he said. Of them, only 200 are full-time
FEMA employees. Six hundred are regular reservists who have been
trained in advance and are called up in time of need. The remaining
2,200 are hired locally and get one day of training before being
thrown in the breach.
   Hurricane damage has accounted for 350,000 disaster aid
applications from Puerto Rico, 8,000 from the Virgin Islands,
51,000 from South Carolina and 2,800 from North Carolina, McAda
said.
   A week after the earthquake struck California's Bay area, 10,000
applications have come in from the 12 disaster centers in seven
counties, said FEMA spokeswoman Rhoda Brooks.
   More than 400 people of various specialties from the Army Corps
of Engineers have been dispatched from around the country to verify
disaster claims before FEMA signs checks.
   The total number of applications from Hugo and the earthquake
alone amount to more than three years' worth under normal
ccircumstances, McAda said.
   ``I don't think our people would ever admit they have reached
their limit. Somewhere down the line you will run out of manpower,
but I don't know where that is,'' he said.
   ``Do you put together an agency that is big enough to handle the
current situation, then sit around and do nothing for a year?
That's not very effecive.''
   Instead, FEMA lets people like Smith and Lytle do the sitting
around.
   ``I just sit at home and rock slowly 'til they call me,'' Lytle
said.

   Eight Eastern Airlines employees
were arrested on charges of stealing things such as drugs and
jewelry at Palm Beach International Airport, authorities said.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen announced the indictment Tuesday
against 15 Eastern employees on charges such as conspiracy to steal
from the U.S. mail, theft from the U.S. mail and conspiracy to
steal credit cards.
   The charges resulted from a one-year investigation into the
theft of Express Mail aboard Eastern Airlines aircraft. According
to the indictment, the employees were instructed by a
co-conspirator on how to take the contents from Express Mail
envelopes.
   One Express Mail shipment contained 14 spools of 25-foot and
50-foot lengths of gold chains. Officials said the conspirators
split the proceeds when the chains were sold. Several defendants
were charged with removing marijuana and cocaine from the mail and
distributing it to others.

   Paul McCartney says his better relations with other
former Beatles has made it possible for him to play the legendary
group's songs in public again.
   ``My relations with former members of the band have improved.
Those songs are wonderful memories for me and that is why I am
playing them again,'' he told reporters Tuesday before his Rome
concert, part of a world tour promoting his latest album ``Flowers

   Those songs include ``Can't Buy Me Love,'' ``Eleanor Rigby,''
``Back in the USSR,'' ``Hey Jude'' and ``Yesterday,'' which he

   A 17-year-old high school senior will

   ``My reaction was very surprised, and I'm very excited,''
Yasmine Begum Delawari said Tuesday after she was named by Don W.
Fedde, president of the Tournament of Roses Association.
   Miss Delawari, a Pasadena area resident, was chosen from seven
finalists who constitute the tournament's royal court. The queen
and six attendants were chosen from more than 800 applicants
following four interviews, said Kristin Mabry Tranquada, a

   Judges made their selections based on the candidates' public
speaking ability, poise, academic achievement and personality.
   ``This is the start of a new century for the Tournament of
Roses, so I just plan to do the best I can to represent them,''
said Miss Delawari, who hopes to attend the University of
California, Los Angeles.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton says he wants to
get back to running the state after a judge issued a no-fault
divorce award ending his 23-year marriage to former Miss America
runner-up Dee Caperton.
   The governor didn't attend Monday's brief proceedings during
which Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Herman Canady approved the
divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.
   The action halted a tandem $12 million fraud suit Mrs. Caperton
had filed in federal court against the governor and two others.
   ``I'm pleased to have it behind us,'' the governor said in a
statement. ``I think it's time to move forward.''
   No details were released on the settlement, but Mrs. Caperton's
attorney, Stanley Preiser, said as he left Canady's office: ``Both
cases have been settled. Everybody's happy and she's extremely
satisfied.''
   ``You can underline extremely,'' Mrs. Caperton added.
   In July, Mrs. Caperton filed for divorce and in August followed
it up with her fraud suit, alleging she had been duped into selling
her stock in the family insurance business for $2.98 million when
the stock was worth far more.

   The Who, The Four Tops, the Four Seasons, the
Kinks, the Platters, Hank Ballard, Bobby Darin and Simon and
Garfunkel have been selected for induction Jan. 17 to the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame.
   The selections bring to 43 the number of recording acts chosen
for the hall and represent ``a good cross section'' of musical
style, rock historian Norm N. Nite said Tuesday. It also represents
an effort to honor people long overdue for recognition, he added.
   ``We're trying to get caught up on a lot of people owed getting
in. As years go by, it will get tighter and tighter,'' said Nite,
who has two syndicated radio rock 'n' roll oldies shows.
   Besides the recording artists, three ``early influencers'' were
selected to be honored at the as-yet unbuilt hall of fame and
museum _ jazz singer-trumpeter Louis Armstrong, jazz guitarist
Charlie Christian and blues pioneer Ma Rainey.
   Two songwriting teams will be inducted in the non-performing
music industry category, although some have been important
performers as well. The writers include the teams of Brian Holland,
Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland, and Gerry Goffin and Carole King.

   Hockey's great one was escorted down Main
Street U.S.A. by the squeaky one, the incoherent one and the goofy
one as the Magic Kingdom paid tribute to Wayne Gretzky.
   Gretzky, 28, wife Janet Jones and their 10-month-old daughter
participated in a parade Tuesday to the Town Square Train Station.
Also in the parade were Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy,
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said.
   Disney has produced many commercials featuring athletes who have
just won a Super Bowl or World Series saying they plan to go to
Disneyland next, but Roth said there are no plans to ask Gretzky,
`` ... what are you going to do now?''
   The Los Angeles Kings' center last week became the National
Hockey League's all-time scoring champion, eclipsing Gordie Howe's
record.
   ``This is special in that with most honors you get a trophy or a
plaque and you can just enjoy those by yourself,'' Gretzky said.
``But this way I can enjoy the day with my wife and daughter. Just
to spend the day here is quite an honor.''

   A study suggests the nutritional needs of
women with eating disorders differ from those of normal women.
   A study by Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic found that
women recovering from bulimia needed only 73 percent of the normal
intake of calories. Conversely, women recovering from anorexia
needed two-thirds more calories than normal.
   Bulimia is the disorder of gorging and purging. Anorexia is an
avoidance of food.
   The study of 23 recovering bulimic women who were trying to
maintain normal weight found that the women required only 10
calories per pound of body weight, or 73 percent of the 13.8 daily
calories per pound that healthy women need.
   Separate studies involving 31 recovering anorexic women found
they needed 22.3 calories per pound of body weight to maintain
their normal weight.
   ``These findings have led to new treatment methods in our
program ... and they help us to understand the physiological
factors that complicate the psychological issues of eating
disorders,'' said Dr. Walter Kaye, director of the institute's
Center for Overcoming Problem Eating.
   The findings were published in a recent issue of the American
Journal of Nutrition and released to the public Tuesday in
conjunction with Easting Disorders Awareness Week.
   The studies were conducted during the last three years, Kaye
said.

   Please, doesn't anybody out there love a
bureaucrat?
   Last June, entrepreneur Matthew Lesko launched ``My Favorite
Bureaucrat'' contest and invited people around the country to
submit ``a brief, verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a
government bureaucrat helped you.''
   Lesko offered a $5,000 cash prize for the winning entry and
figured he'd be swamped with nominations. After all, he says, there
are plenty of federal, state and local bureaucrats to choose from _
about 15 million altogether.
   Today, Lesko is flabbergasted. In the past four months, he has
received exactly one entry.
   Even worse, it was submitted by a woman employee of the New York
State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss.
   ``My God, I just can't believe the lack of response,'' said
Lesko, the author of books and newsletters on where to get free
advice from government experts on everything from playing the stock
market to curing a backache to buying a new refrigerator.
   Lesko says he plugged the contest in thousands of news releases
mailed from his suburban Chevy Chase, Md., office, on Larry King's
radio show, Pat Sajak's television show and the C-SPAN cable TV
network, and in speeches around the country promoting the dozen
books he has written.
   Besides the $5,000 prize for the contest winner, Lesko promised
$500 to each of two runners-up, a plaque for the winning ``favorite
bureaucrat'' and a free list of the government's two dozen best
sources of information for every contest participant.
   ``I can't believe how this idea fell so flat,'' Lesko
complained. He suspects the problem runs deeper than any lack of
publicity.
   ``The government is the biggest source of information and help
on anything you could want,'' he said. ``All the millionaires, like
Lee Iacocca and Donald Trump, use it. I even got free legal advice
from the Federal Trade Commission on how to run this contest.
   ``But the average guy in the street probably just hates the
government, is intimidated by it and doesn't think there's anything
there but waste, fraud and abuse,'' Lesko said.
   ``The only contact most people have with the government is
dealing with the Internal Revenue Service and the division of motor
vehicles, which are probably the two worst experiences anybody can
have.''
   The public's antagonism toward the government apparently is so
virulent, Lesko said, that a contest to nominate the biggest
bureaucratic bunglers probably would produce a flood of entries.
   ``I wouldn't do that to the Post Office,'' he said.
   Someone who understands the public's reluctance to identify
helpful, competent bureaucrats is James H. Boren, a former State
Department official and Washington humorist who is president of the
International Association of Professional Bureaucrats.
   ``People are rather fearful of making such information public,''
Boren said. ``If they say a bureaucrat has helped them, it's like
saying they've seen a UFO in the sky. People might think they're
not totally balanced.''

   Explosions that may have been caused by
illegal fireworks leveled one house and set two others on fire
Tuesday, killing at least two people and injuring 13 others,
authorities said.
   Crews worked into the night, searching the rubble for other
possible victims of the blast, said Fire Chief Bim Orrenmaa.
   He said illegal fireworks were suspected as the cause of the
explosions which rocked this city of 13,000 on Lake Erie at the
northeast corner of Ohio.
   The fire chief initially said the explosion killed three people,
but later revised the number to two, saying he had been incorrectly
told that one injured person had died.
   Brian Hubbard, an investigator with the Ashtabula County
coroner's office, confirmed two deaths.
   Orrenmaa said firefighters found devices that looked like
fireworks in the home where the explosion and two subsequent blasts
occurred just before noon.
   ``We had a lot of small bangs,'' before the big explosion and
two subsequent blasts, Orrenmaa said.
   Students were evacuated from a nearby elementary school, but
there were no other evacuations.
   Patrolman Michael Strine said the explosion blew out windows of
at least 20 homes in a six-block area.
   The victims were not immediately identified.
   A 46-year-old woman who lived at the house where the explosions
occurred was taken to Hamot Medical Center in Erie, Pa., 25 miles
east of Conneaut, said hospital spokeswoman Wendy DePalma. She was
in satisfactory condition.
   Twelve people were taken to Brown Memorial Hospital in Conneaut,
then released, said hospital administrator George Whitney. He said
most of the injuries did not appear serious.
   John Kingsolver, an agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, said 10 agents were at the scene. Kingsolver
said that tubes, resembling parts of fireworks, were found.
   The state Emergency Management Agency in Ashtabula County said
it was investigating.

   Here is an edited transcript of the 10-minute
conversation Monday night between state police dispatcher Gary
McLaughlin and Charles Stuart, who had been abducted and shot along
with his wife after leaving a birthing class at Brigham and Women's
Hospital.
   Stuart was communicating on his automobile telephone as he and
his wife lay wounded in the front seat of their car. The wife later
died, but the baby, a boy, was saved by Caesarean section.

   ``Two minutes, three minutes ...''
   ``OK, sir, bear with me now, stand by, stay on the phone with
me.''
   ``Should I try to drive or should I stay where I am?''
   ``No. ... The people that shot you, are they in the area right
there?''
   ``No, they, they took off, they left.''
   ``OK, can you look out, can you get out of the vehicle and look
around to see where you are, sir? I'm trying to get some assistance
to you.''
   ``Should I drive up to the corner of the street?''
   ``If you can drive, sir, without hurting yourself, yes, if you
could. Just try to give me a cross street. If you can drive give me
any street indication and stay there, I'll get someone right to
you.''
   ``I'll start the car. He took the keys but I have a spare set.
Oh, man. I'm starting the car.''

<HEAD>Son Says Father Feared Re-Imprisonment in Wife's 1954 Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard, acquitted in the
murder of his wife after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed his
conviction due to pretrial publicity, always feared he would be put
back in prison, his son said.
   Ending 20 years of silence on the case, Sam R. Sheppard said in
a speech that he is speaking out in hopes of clearing his father's
name.
   ``Every reference to that (landmark Supreme Court) decision 23
years ago calls my father a convicted murderer,'' he said Tuesday,
35 years after his father was first brought to trial. ``That's not
fair. That conviction was thrown out.''
   The elder Sheppard, an osteopath who was well known in the
Cleveland suburb of Bay Village, was convicted of murder in the
1954 bludgeoning of his pregnant wife, Marilyn. He served nine
years in prison before the nation's high court reversed the
conviction.
   Sheppard was acquitted after a second trial. He died in 1970 at
age 46. The case remains unsolved.
   The younger Sheppard, 42, had been long silent on the case until
this week's speaking tour. On Tuesday, he spoke at Youngstown State
University.
   He was 7 years old at the time of the slaying, and lived with an
uncle after after his father was imprisoned. After the Supreme
Court decision, the elder Sheppard feared constantly that he would
be forced to return to prison, his son said.
   His exoneration in 1966 eased those worries but created new ones.
   ``There is still this stigma in our society that if you're
accused, you're guilty,'' he said. ``He couldn't cope with society.
... He was a great guy, but, I kept my distance. I didn't want to
go down with him. That was the agreement between us.''
   Sheppard said the person he believed responsible for his
mother's killing was the same person who broke into his family's
house two days before the slaying. That person, he said, later was
convicted in an unrelated slaying.
   He said he knew the identity of the alleged killer, but would
not reveal the name to the audience.
   Last summer, police indicated they might consider re-opening the
investigation into Mrs. Sheppard's slaying following the murder
conviction of the Sheppards' one-time window washer.
   Richard Eberling was arrested in 1959 after being found with a
large amount of jewelry belonging to Marilyn Sheppard and her
husband's brother, Richard Sheppard.
   In August, Eberling told The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer from
prison that he was familiar with the circumstances surrounding Mrs.
Sheppard's death.

   Thieves who stole a specially bred golden
retriever and left behind a pumpkin won't face criminal charges if
they return the puppy unharmed, its owner says.
   While stealing the 9-week-old female Monday, the thieves also
painted the words ``Happy Halloween. Thanks for the dog. Sorry no
money...Don't worry, be happy,'' police said.
   The 18-pound pup, named Penny, is a top-of-the-line show dog,
the product of 17 years of breeding, said owner Lynda Bennett, a
breeder and veterinarian. She said the puppy is worth $30,000 to
her but would not be worth as much to thieves because they lack
documentation that it is a purebred.
   She said she would drop all charges and ask no questions if
Penny was returned.
   ``They've taken away my future on top of breaking my heart,''
said Bennett. ``This puppy is like one of my babies. She's part of
my family.''

<HEAD>Line-Item Veto Would Prompt Court Case: Edwards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any effort by President Bush to exercise a
line-item veto will prompt a lawsuit by members of Congress, the
chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee says.
   The line-item veto ``is an idea that many of us would resist
very diligently,'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the
civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary
Committee, said Tuesday after White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush was considering such a move.
   Bush, Fitzwater said, is prepared to take such a step despite
lack of specific constitutional authority ``to see if it works.''
   Although Bush has called for a constitutional amendment to give
him the ability to veto just one item in a bill while leaving the
rest intact, such a proposal has never made much headway in
Congress.
   Former President Reagan tried unsuccessfully for eight years to
persuade Congress to propose such a constitutional change to the
states for ratification.
   Some legal scholars contend that line-item veto powers are
implied in a president's overall veto power. However, the concept
has never been tested.
   Such a notion, Edwards said in an interview, comes from ``chit
chat in conservative circles'' and has little constitutional
legitimacy.
   ``We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test
case, but at this point we don't have one,'' Fitzwater said, adding
that it was anticipated such a move would provoke a court challenge.
   Were Bush to cast such a veto, Edwards said, ``a majority of the
members of the Judiciary Committee'' would promptly take him to
court.
   However, Edwards conceded the issue could remain in limbo for
years until it makes its way to the Supreme Court.
   ``Conservatives could have a field day,'' he said. ``They think
they could get several years of line-item vetoes.''
   Administration sources said it was unlikely the test case would
come soon because there is nothing before the president that is a
likely candidate.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
tentative target had been selected by White House counsel Boyden
Gray _ a provision once in the Interior Department appropriations
bill to ban a requirement that members of Congress keep a log of
contacts with lobbyists.
   However, the House stripped the provision from the bill before
the president could decide whether to exercise a line-item veto.
   White House officials are keeping a sharp eye out, however, for
another candidate. Sources said they are looking for a provision
that is unrelated to the main bill, and on which a veto would not
disrupt public policy or important services.

   Emergency crews searched the charred,
twisted rubble of a plastics plant Tuesday looking for victims of
fiery explosions that hurled wreckage miles away. At least two
people were killed, 22 presumed dead and 124 injured.
   ``There's just nothing left,'' Harris County Sheriff Johnny
Klevenhagen said after venturing into the still-smoldering plant
No. 5 at the Phillips Petroleum Co. complex.
   Officials located but could not remove the body of a second
victim Tuesday, partly buried in mounds of concrete and steel
beams. They said it would take heavy equipment to fully search the
ruins. One body was found Monday.
   Company officials in Pasadena said late Tuesday that the 22
missing workers were presumed dead.
   ``Any employee in that wreckage probably didn't survive,'' said
Jere Smith, director of public relations for Phillips.
   Later Tuesday, officials at the company's Bartlesville, Okla.,
headquarters said 19 Phillips employees were either dead or missing
and four contract workers were missing _ for a total of 23.
Spokesman Bill Wertz could not explain the discrepancy in the
victim totals.
   Fires that followed the blasts and were fueled by highly
flammable chemicals had been contained in small areas. Only a thin
column of smoke rose from the plant Tuesday, 24 hours after the
first explosions, which shattered windows three miles away and were
felt 25 miles away.
   Some entire buildings inside the chemical plant complex had
disappeared, Klevenhagen said, and elsewhere pipes and metal
framework were broken and dangling.
   ``It is devastated,'' Klevenhagen said. ``Major, major damage.
It's going to take extremely heavy equipment to remove the debris.
   ``The problem we're finding is that there are areas of the plant
we just can't get to. We're going to have to bring in a bulldozer
to make a road.''
   Klevenhagen and a crew of firefighters, safety inspectors and a
medical examiner made the first foray into the ruins at the complex
outside Houston.
   Frantic relatives gathered and scanned lists of known survivors
Monday night. Many continued their vigil outside the plant Tuesday.
   Mary De La Vergne, 38, found the name of her husband, Cipriana
Rodriguez, 43, on the list of missing workers.
   ``I had just taken him lunch,'' said Ms. De La Vergne. ``I heard
the explosion when I was going back home.''
   ``I can only keep on hoping,'' she said, collapsing into tears.
   Of the 124 people reported injured, 35 remained hospitalized
Tuesday, with six in critical condition. Dr. Paul Pepe, Houston's
emergency medical director, said the patient in the worst condition
was a woman with first- and second-degree burns over half her body.
   The plant, which produced 4.5 million pounds a day of
polyethylene plastic used in everything from milk jugs to grocery
sacks, erupted in a series of explosions that began just after 1
p.m. Monday, sending debris flying as far as six miles.
   The fire raged into the evening Monday, fueled by plastics and
by ethylene and isobutane gases, which are both used to make
plastics. By Tuesday it had been contained in small, controlled
areas.
   ``We don't feel there is any danger of further explosions,''
said Smith. ``We're past that.''
   As many as 400 firefighters battled the blaze. Water had to
pumped from a sewage treatment plant and the nearby Houston Ship
Channel after the explosions knocked out water service to the area.
   Officials arranged Tuesday to move hundreds of employees' cars
that were damaged in the parking lot and hampered cleanup efforts.
   More than 900 people work in three shifts at the plant, built in
1948 on an 800-acre site, said Dave Dryden, spokesman at Phillips
headquarters in Bartlesville, Okla. Workers whose jobs were
affected by the explosion will continue to be paid, Smith said, but
some may be laid off later.
   Officials didn't immediately know what caused the explosion.
   Phillips environmental director Bill Stoltz said a seal blew out
on an ethylene loop reactor, in which chemical reactions take place
to create polyethylene out of ethylene, a component of natural gas.
   The seal break released hydrocarbon vapor which ignited.
   ``There are 100 ways that could occur. We don't know how the
ignition occurred,'' Phillips President Glenn Cox said.
   The ethylene is fed to the plant through a pipeline from Sweeny,
about 75 miles southwest of the plant in this town of 100,000
people. The pipeline was shut down after the blast.
   Inspectors from the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration joined Phillips'
emergency response team in assessing damages.
   Robert Benz, plastic resins manager at the plant, said there was
no immediate damage estimate. ``It'll be a big number,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Time is Money in Budget-Balancing Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush excused his lateness for an
award ceremony for math teachers by joking he was busy ``trying to
solve a few quadratic equations.'' He said the exercise was
``somewhat more difficult than balancing the budget.''
   Having pretty much given up on the notion of balancing the
budget any time soon, administration officials are trying to juggle
a slew of budget-policy equations to gloss over a continuing
impasse with Congress.
   Bush told the math and science teachers gathered in the Rose
Garden on Tuesday that he gets much of his scientific understanding
from the comic strips.
   He cited a Gary Larson cartoon ``where, after detailed
calculations, Einstein discovers that time is actually money.''
   Time was money, in fact, in the federal response to the
California earthquake.
   Last week's devastating quake gave rise to weekend speculation
that the administration was considering some form of tax surcharge
or increase _ most likely in the gasoline tax _ to help pay for a
federal relief effort expected to cost U.S. taxpayers around $3
billion.
   After all, that's a big chunk, and where was the money to come
from in an already overburdened federal budget?
   The tax speculation was fueled by Bush's own repeated failure to
rule out a tax increase when asked by reporters about the prospects
during his tour of the San Francisco Bay area's earthquake damage.
   However, it turned out that Bush _ once again _ could stick with
the ``no new taxes'' vow of the 1988 campaign.
   A quirk in the nation's budget laws allowed administration and
congressional officials to ``find'' money for quake relief without
having to face the issue of raising taxes.
   Congress' inability to agree on a deficit-reduction package for
the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 resulted in across-the-board cuts
of $16.1 billion under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   But those cuts took effect Oct. 16 _ the day before the
earthquake _ and there is no mechanism for further automatic budget
reductions for another year.
   Thus, the Gramm-Rudman law ``is not applicable in this case,''
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater declared. ``It's a
whole other ball game,'' he said.
   Budget Director Richard Darman and congressional budgeters are
finding other equations that, like Larson's Einstein, turn time, or
at least delay, into money.
   For instance, by not counting the cost of the government's
bailout of savings and loan institutions as part of the deficit,
the ``real'' degree of red ink is understated.
   And, the deficit is further made to look less menacing by
another accounting gimmick involving Social Security funds.
   The current surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund _ a
surplus that will vanish once baby-boom generation workers get to
retirement age around the turn of the century _ is being used to
help finance the deficit.
   The law requires money in the fund to be used to buy government
securities, which in turn are largely used to finance the deficit.
Not only are Social Security receipts being used to help retire the
national debt, but the fact that there's a surplus in the account
makes the deficit in other programs look smaller _ on paper.
   The ``real'' current budget deficit, discounting the Social
Security surplus and putting back in the costs of the S&amp;L bailout
and other programs now exempt, is closer to $250 billion than the
$116.2 billion projected by the OMB.
   Meanwhile, Bush doesn't have much to say these days about the
``flexible freeze'' he talked about during his campaign.
   But, he told the math and science teachers: ``I had a friend who
was so smart once that he knew how to convert meters to gallons. In
his head.''

<HEAD>Afghan Invasion a `Mistake,' but Soviet Aid Continues</HEAD>

   Ten years and 1.5 million Afghan lives ago,
the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. This week, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze called it a mistake.
   But Shevardnadze gave no indication that the Kremlin was
withdrawing its military support to the government created by the
Soviet invasion.
   The current Afghan government ``was put in place as a result of
the intervention that he now says was a contravention of moral
norms,'' said Barnett R. Rubin, a specialist on Afghanistan at the
Washington-based Institute for Peace.
   In a speech to the Supreme Soviet on Monday, Shevardnadze
admitted the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan ``ignored universal human
values'' and involved ``gross violations of our own laws.''
   One-third of Afghanistan's pre-war population of 14 million has
fled the country since the invasion, and about 70 percent of the
nation's cities, villages and agricultural land have been
destroyed, according to administration estimates.
   It is unusual but not unprecedented for the foreign minister of
a superpower to acknowledge that a previous administration erred in
wreaking such devastation on another country.
   Cyrus R. Vance, in confirmation hearings before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee before he became President Carter's
secretary of state in 1977, said the U.S. intervention in Vietnam
was wrong.
   ``In the light of hindsight, I believe it was a mistake to have
intervened in Vietnam,'' Vance testified, pledging ``not to
mislead'' Congress as Carter's predecessors had done in waging war
in Indochina.
   Carter continued the detente of his Republican predecessors, but
rapprochement with Moscow fell apart when the Red Army invaded
Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Carter canceled U.S. participation in the 1980 Summer Olympic
Games in Moscow, embargoed the sale of U.S. grain to the Soviet
Union and began to aid Afghan guerrillas.
   Despite Vance's capitulation, the United States still has not
granted diplomatic recognition to Vietnam's communist government,
14 years after the fall of the U.S.-backed government in Saigon.
Nor could Vance restore the lives of the 900,000 Vietnamese and
60,000 Americans who died in the conflict.
   And his statements did not mark a permanent change in U.S.
policy. President Reagan made it clear he did not share Vance's
opposition to military intervention abroad, as he armed Nicaragua's
Contra guerrillas, invaded Grenada and bombed the headquarters of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Vance accepted blame, whereas Shevardnadze did not. Vance had
been an architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam, serving as Army
secretary and undersecretary of defense in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations.
   Shevardnadze, in his speech, stressed that when the Red Army
invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, he and the current Soviet
leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, were non-voting members of the ruling
Communist Party Politburo.
   ``I found out about what had happened from radio and newspaper
reports. A decision that had very serious consequences for our
country was made behind the back of the party and the people. We
were confronted with a fait accompli,'' Shevardnadze said.
   A private American specialist on Afghanistan, Selig Harrison of
the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Washington, said that during a
trip to Moscow in April he was told that Gorbachev was an early
opponent of the Afghan invasion, but there is little direct
evidence of that.
   ``There was substantial disagreement from the beginning,''
Harrison said. Gorbachev, who in 1979 was the Politburo member in
charge of agriculture, ``expressed objections to the diversion of
funds to the war that had been programmed for agriculture,''
Harrison said.
   Since the Red Army withdrew in February, Soviet military aid to
the Afghan government headed by President Najibullah has been
estimated at $250 million to $300 million a month by U.S.
government analysts, and at up to $400 million a month by Rep. Don
Ritter, R-Pa., a harsh critic of the Kremlin.
   By contrast, the United States has been sending an estimated
$500 million a year in military aid to mujahedeen guerrillas of
Afghanistan.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said, ``We
welcome the Soviet admission and encourage them to take the next
logical step to correct the Soviet mistake: Transfer of power from
the illegitimate (Najibullah) regime to a government acceptable to
all the Afghan people.''

<HEAD>`Zero Tolerance' Anti-Drug Program Relaxed Further</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is again easing the ``zero
tolerance'' anti-drug policy _ which required immediate seizure of
illegal drug users' cars and boats _ to let some people pay a fine
and go on their way.
   ``Our goal and intent is still user accountability,'' said
Customs Service senior special agent Ed Callahan, who oversees the
program along with the Coast Guard.
   The changes are intended to ``streamline the program, make it
more effective, more equitable,'' he said Tuesday.
   Officials hope the new guidelines will save time and money now
spent on seizing cars, trucks and boats at the borders or in U.S.
territorial limits because small amounts of illegal drugs are found
inside.
   This is the third easing in the zero tolerance program since it
began March 21, 1988, with then-Customs Commissioner William von
Raab declaring: ``There will be no mercy.''
   Under the original rules, a driver heading across the border
into the United States with a small amount of marijuana in his car
could be stopped and his auto seized by the government. If he
wanted to get the car back immediately, he would have to pay the
full value of the car plus any fines, said Customs Service
spokesman Dennis Shimkoski.
   The new guidelines were signed Oct. 18 by Acting Customs
Commissioner Michael Lane, but they were effective Oct. 11.
   The limits of drugs for which the new rules apply are an ounce
of marijuana or hashish, a gram of cocaine, heroin or
methamphetamine, one-tenth of a gram of PCP and 500 micrograms of
LSD, Callahan said.
   Under the new rules, Callahan said, the car still could be
seized by federal agents under certain circumstances, such as if
the driver were impaired by the drug found in the car. More likely,
the driver simply would be charged with a failure to report that he
was bringing marijuana into the country.
   That violation required a penalty of $5,000 to $10,000, but the
Customs Service has reduced that by 90 percent, he said.
   ``Realizing that that is not proportionate to the violation, the
penalty would be $500 for the first offense, $1,000 for the second
offense,'' Callahan said.
   ``If you pay that penalty at the time of the incident, you get
in your car and drive away,'' he said. ``If you refuse to pay the
penalty, the automobile will be seized, just as it was in the past,
because we have made an offer of a mitigated penalty, which you
have rejected.''
   But forget putting the fine on Visa or MasterCharge. The Customs
Service doesn't take plastic, only cash, a cashier's check or some
other negotiable instrument, he said.
   If the car's owner had loaned the auto to someone else who was
carrying a small amount of an illegal drug, the federal agent would
decide on a case-by-case basis what would happen to the car,
Callahan said.
   Since the zero tolerance program began, Customs has seized 8,076
personal vehicles such as cars, pickup trucks and motorcycles, 452
commercial-type trucks, 190 boats and 13 aircraft, Shimkoski said.
About 75 percent of the total value has been returned to its
owners, excluding penalties.
   The new guidelines also change the policy for boats found with
the user-amounts of drugs on board. Under the new guidelines, the
owners of all boats with such drugs on board will be issued a
summons requiring them to report to Customs in 15 to 30 days for
handling of their case, Callahan said.
   The government in February exempted fishing boats heading to or
from fishing grounds from immediate seizure. Other boats, however,
were subject to seizure, requiring the Coast Guard to bring the
boats to shore, keep them safe and take in the owners.
   Under the first revision in the policy, made in May 1988,
Customs or Coast Guard authorities who found small amounts of drugs
on boats more than 12 miles offshore would seize the boats only if
they appeared to be transporting drugs into the country.
   The change was prompted by an outcry that erupted when the
Atlantis II, owned by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of
Massachusetts, the $2.5 million yacht Ark Royal and the Monkey
Business _ the pleasure boat that former presidential candidate
Gary Hart sailed on with model Donna Rice _ were seized when small
quantities of drugs were discovered on board.

<HEAD>Senate GOP Proposes Eastern Europe Aid Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans who want to blunt
Democrats' efforts to seize the upper hand on U.S. aid to Eastern
Europe are proposing their own three-year, $585 million program.
   Meanwhile, President Bush struck back at critics of his aid
program, saying in an interview with The New York Times that he's
tired of complaints from ``people who found Poland on the globe
about three weeks ago.''
   The GOP plan for Poland and Hungary, assembled by Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and seven Republican colleagues, was a
middle ground between Bush's $450 million proposal and an $837
million version passed by the House last week.
   ``We do not believe the test of American policy in Poland and
Hungary is how many dollars we spend, but how we can best achieve
our national goals in those two countries,'' Dole said in a
statement.
   The issue was scheduled to come to the Senate floor today.
   In an interview published in today's editions of the Times, Bush
said changes taking place in Eastern Europe are ``absolutely
extraordinary, but I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting
to any of this.''
   ``Democrats on Capitol Hill have been calling me `timid,''' Bush
said. ``I have other, better words, like `cautious,' `diplomatic,'
`prudent.'''
   An outline of the bill calls the GOP approach ``generous, but
fiscally prudent, rejecting the notion that Poland will benefit
from a bidding war between American political parties.''
   Democrats have criticized Bush's response to the sweeping
changes in Eastern Europe and sought to demonstrate leadership by
proposing a far more generous program.
   Democrats' higher aid figures ``make no economic sense at this
point,'' Dole said, contending that private enterprise will take
time to evolve from the two countries' centrally planned economies.
   ``Just pouring aid dollars into Poland and Hungary will not do
the trick,'' Dole said.
   The GOP proposal included some of the features of the
House-passed legislation, which won strong bipartisan support.
   It would provide $200 million as the U.S. share of a $1 billion
international fund to stabilize Poland's economy and $112 million
in immediate food aid for Poland. But instead of providing new
money, it would require that the $200 million come out of the
already tight foreign aid budget.
   Another $125 million would be used to support new private
business ventures, including joint ventures with Americans. The
House bill calls for $200 million in private enterprise support.
   The Republican alternative omits a $200 million guarantee fund
the House version provides to underwrite sales to Poland by U.S.
exporters.
   The Senate GOP bill would make the aid specifically contingent
on continuing transition toward democracy in the two countries and
development of a free-enterprise economy.
   Poland has elected a government that for the first time in four
decades is not controlled by the Communist Party. Candidates of the
Solidarity trade union dominate the new legislature.
   Hungary has been making strides toward a more open political
system as well, and has become the first Eastern European country
to physically tear down fences dividing it from the West.

<HEAD>Budget for Overseas Bases Cut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators who say the United
States is shouldering a disproportionate share of the worldwide
defense burden approved an $8.5 billion military construction bill
that cuts President Bush's budget for bases overseas.
   ``We've seen the peak for military construction spending,'' said
Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on military construction.
   Thwarted in earlier efforts to reduce troop levels overseas,
members of the House and Senate targeted money used for such items
as barracks, munitions centers and storage facilities at military
installations worldwide.
   Specifically, negotiators approved an $85.5 million cut from the
$86.3 million Bush requested for South Korea. Several members of
Congress have called for reductions in the 43,000 U.S. personnel
stationed in South Korea _ an arrangement that costs the federal
government $2.6 billion a year.
   The House is expected to act Thursday or Friday on the
legislation, which members of the House and Senate Appropriations
subcommittees on military construction approved by voice vote
Tuesday.
   The bill, covering the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, provides
$500 million less than this year's level for military construction
but about $500 million more than Bush requested.
   Sasser, discussing the Senate version of the bill last month,
said the ``best way to make our defense dollar go further is to
secure a more equitable burden sharing from our allies.''
   Lawmakers agreed to cut all $40.8 million Bush requested for the
Philippines, basing the decision on upcoming negotiations on a new
treaty to replace the Military Bases Agreement.
   The U.S.-Philippines pact under which the United States leases
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base will expire in September
1991. Talks are expected to begin in December, and Vice President
Dan Quayle said last month he was hopeful a ``mutually acceptable
agreement will provide for a longtime stay by the Unites States.''
   However, opposition to the U.S. presence is strong. Quayle's
visit to the Philippines was marked by demonstrations. Hours before
the vice president arrived, two American civilians were killed near
a U.S. base.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused to say whether
she favors keeping the U.S. bases, but she is expected to discuss
the issue when she visits Washington next month.
   Senate negotiators also accepted the House plan to allocate $500
million to close 86 military facilities in the United States, scale
back five others and change the mission at 54 other installations.
Bush had requested $500 million.

   New East German leader Egon Krenz ``can't turn
the clock back'' to prevent major changes and the possibility of
German reunification, President Bush says.
   In an interview in today's editions of The New York Times, Bush
characterized the changes as ``too inexorable'' to halt.
   The president also struck back at congressional critics of his
aid program for Eastern Europe, saying he's tired of complaints
from ``people who found Poland on the globe about three weeks ago.''
   Bush said changes taking place in Eastern Europe are
``absolutely extraordinary, but I'm not going to be stampeded into
overreacting to any of this.''
   He also said he does not share ``the concern that some European
countries have about a reunified Germany because I think Germany's
commitment to and recognition of the importance of the alliance is
unshakable.
   ``And I don't see Germany, in order to get reunification, going
off onto what some are concerned about, and that is a neutralist
path that puts them at odds, or potentially at odds, with their
NATO partners.''
   During a visit to Eastern Europe in July, Bush proposed a
three-year, $149 million aid package for Poland and Hungary to
encourage fledgling economic and political reforms. Since then,
under pressure from Capitol Hill, he has raised the value of his
aid proposal to about $450 million.
   Last week, the Democratic-controlled House _ with strong backing
from Republicans _ approved a three-year, $837 million aid package
for the two countries.
   Bush also has been stung by the rhetoric of Democratic leaders,
who have denounced the president's policy as ``timid.''
   In the Times interview, Bush said: ``Democrats on Capitol Hill
have been calling me `timid.' I have other, better words, like
`cautious,' `diplomatic,' `prudent.'''

<HEAD>Auditors Raise New Safety Issue at Savannah River Arms Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department may have to spend more
than $8 million to correct a newly disclosed problem at the
Savannah River nuclear weapons plant, according to federal auditors
who say the flaw raises new safety concerns.
   In a report Tuesday to a House Government Operations
subcommittee, the General Accounting Office revealed that tubes
containing materials used in Savannah River's nuclear reactors were
either made to incorrect specifications or their specifications
could not be determined because of ``paperwork problems.''
   Use of badly flawed tubes could, in the worst case, lead to an
uncontrolled chain reaction in the reactors that produce a gas used
in nuclear warheads, the GAO said.
   When the problem was discovered in September 1988 by E.I. du
Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which was the Savannah River operator, the
Energy Department ordered Du Pont to stop making the tubes and stop
putting them in the reactors until the cause of the problem and its
significance could be pinpointed.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said that ``several
months'' later it was determined that the tube flaws weren't
serious enough to pose a safety problem, but that none of them will
be used in the reactors, which have been shut down since April 1988
for repairs and safety upgrades.
   It said the Energy Department estimated it would cost $731,000
to replace the 174 flawed tubes and an additional 101 tubes
affected by the problem.
   Keith Fultz, the GAO's director of energy issues, told the
subcommittee the cost could go beyond $8 million, depending on how
the department chooses to handle the corrections.
   The report said that while the department has taken steps aimed
at preventing a recurrence, the incident raises further questions
about the department's ability to improve management at Savannah
River, which is situated near Aiken, S.C.
   ``This is another in a series of incidents at Savannah River
Site pointing out poor internal controls and management inattention
to safety,'' the GAO report said.
   The report said the specifications of some of the questionable
tubes could not be determined because Du Pont's records were
out-of-date and gave conflicting accounts of how much enriched
uranium and lithium were in the tubes.
   Department officials at the hearing provided no additional
information about the problem, and Savannah River officials could
not be reached for comment afterward.
   At the same hearing, the department acknowledged it may have
erred in rewarding Du Pont and the operators of some of its other
nuclear weapons plants with millions of dollars in bonuses despite
serious failings in safety and health protection.
   ``There is room for real question'' about whether the Energy
Department should have paid $912,000 in bonuses last year to the
top 25 Du Pont managers at Savannah River, Deputy Energy Secretary
Henson Moore said in sworn testimony.
   Moore acknowledged that the three highest-paid Du Pont
executives, with collective government salaries of $561,000 and
bonuses of $306,000 in 1988, were not based at the plant site. They
worked at Du Pont headquarters at Wilmington, Del.
   From 1984 through 1988, the top 25 Du Pont executives in charge
of running Savannah River got $12.7 million in salaries plus $3.5
million in bonuses from the Energy Department, the figures showed.
   Westinghouse Savannah River Co. took over as operator April 1.
Moore told the committee the top Westinghouse executives are paid
less than were the Du Pont managers, and all top Westinghouse
managers are at the plant.
   Moore did not provide exact figures for Westinghouse salaries or
bonuses.

<HEAD>A Spat Between Two Former Officials: In This Corner...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One side effect of the U.S. inability to
dislodge Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is a highly unusual
public spat between two influential former officials over who is to
blame for the Panama policy failure.
   The finger-pointing, mudslinging and mutual recriminations
carried out recently in prominent newspapers are a departure from
the normal practice of policymakers who disagree. Such disputes
usually are kept private, but the feelings on the Panama situation
run deeply.
   In one corner in this conflict is the Reagan administration's
top diplomat for Latin America, Elliott Abrams, and in the other is
the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm.
William J. Crowe Jr. They have decided to take the gloves off.
   The hawkish Abrams, 41, quit government service in January. The
more dovish Crowe, 64, joined the military six years before Abrams
was born.
   Both have impressive educational backgrounds and relish
intellectual combat. But beyond that, the similarities between them
are few. Aside from their political differences, Abrams is a
relative bantam while Crowe is a 6-foot-tall, 200-pounder.
   Their dispute over Panama boils down to how far the United
States should have gone last year in its efforts to remove Noriega,
a question that has been revived following the failed coup attempt
against Noriega three weeks ago.
   Abrams fired the first salvo against Crowe two days after the
abortive coup attempt, complaining in a New York Times column that
Crowe and the joint chiefs used ``adamant pressure'' to reject
proposals for ``vigorous action'' against Noriega last year.
   These and other allegations prompted Crowe to rebut in a letter
to the Times that Abrams was both ``naive and reckless'' in his
advocacy of the use of military force in Panama.
   Crowe suggested that such attitudes are not uncommon among
``young political appointees who have never served in uniform.''
   In a telephone interview this week, Abrams rejected Crowe's
suggestion that Abrams was alone in the push for a more pugnacious
stand against Noriega.
   ``They were not my positions, they were the State
Department's,'' he said. As for the notion that reckless military
action is often the option favored by those who have never seen
active duty, Abrams replied that a military move in Panama was
urged by his boss, a well-known Marine combat veteran, former
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Crowe did not return a reporter's phone call this week but said
in his letter to the Times that Abrams was wrong from the start
about Panama.
   Abrams, Crowe wrote, offered assurances that the mere threat of
economic sanctions against Panama would oust Noriega.
   ``He then argued with great confidence that actually imposing
sanctions would bring the general to his knees in two weeks. We
tried that and it didn't work either,'' Crowe wrote.
   Abrams denied that he suggested that economic sanctions would
ever be sufficient to bring down Noriega.
   He also suggested that Crowe attempted to influence public
opinion with newspaper leaks designed to discredit the options
Abrams was advocating on behalf of the State Department.
   In a country that adheres to the principle of civilian
supremacy, Abrams said, such activity by a uniformed officer is
``pernicious.''
   Crowe, meanwhile, told The New York Times this week that Abrams
had been ``bad-mouthing me all over town, saying, `Isn't it sort of
weird that the J.C.S. are wimps,' and things like that.
   ``I was getting a little bit tired of Elliott. Now that I'm free
to talk, I felt I should throw down the gauntlet,'' Crowe said.

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are giving National Park
Service Director James Ridenour high marks for refusing to allow a
lumber company to haul timber from national forests through
Yellowstone Park.
   ``I think the park service is to be commended,'' Michael Scott
of the Wilderness Society said Tuesday. ``It did the right thing.''
   Ridenour rejected a U.S. Forest Service argument that an
economic emergency justified the route.
   ``It would have set a very serious precedent,'' Scott said,
contending that private owners would have made similar requests if
the forest service had prevailed.
   Ridenour denied the request on the advice of lawyers who said it
violated federal regulations that prohibit commercial transport
across park roadways, said park service spokesman George Berklacy.
   Ridenour, Berklacy said, was concerned that the plan to move
about 20,000 truckloads of logs through the park would have adverse
impact on important grizzly bear, elk and bison habitats as well as
roadways.
   The forest service sold the timber from national forests
bordering Yellowstone that were partially burned during colossal
fires that swept through the park last year.
   Doug Crandall, manager of Brand-S Lumber Co. in Livingston,
Mont., which bought the wood, said the longer the partially burned
wood remained in the forest, the less value it would have.
   ``In a couple of years, no one will buy it,'' he said.
   However, park service lawyers said the need to sell the logs
quickly didn't constitute an emergency, Berklacy said.
   Ridenour made his decision Monday after meeting Friday with
Yellowstone Superintendent Robert Barbee, national parks lawyer
David Watts and the associate director for park operations, Jack
Morehead, Berklacy said.
   ``The forest service was not leaning on us,'' Berklacy said,
adding that there is an alternative route the lumber company may
use.

<HEAD>Chief Reported in Trouble With Board</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The board of trustees for the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts is moving to possibly reduce the
powers of its chairman and chief executive, sources say.
   The sources said Tuesday night the 45-member board, in a meeting
scheduled for today, may consider changes in the center's bylaws to
ease Ralph Davidson out of some of his responsibilities as the
day-to-day administrator of the cultural center.
   Davidson is reported to have been the source of friction between
some trustees in recent months.
   The sources noted that the bylaws provide for a president, a
position vacant since the center opened in 1971 as the nation's
only official memorial to President John F. Kennedy.
   The Washington Post reported today that 28 trustees said they
don't want to renew Davidson's contract, which expires in January
1991. Some told Davidson they wanted to negotiate an earlier end to
his tenure, the newspaper said.
   Davidson, a former Time Inc. executive, was hired in February
1988 to succeed Broadway producer Roger L. Stevens, the first
chairman. Stevens officially retired in August of this year after a
long transition.
   Reports of Davidson's difficulties surfaced after the board's
last meeting three months ago. One Kennedy Center source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Davidson had come to believe
differences over the future of the center were intractable. The
source didn't detail the differences.
   The newspaper said differences concerned personality clashes and
other matters, not the artistic health of the center.
   Among the matters cited were Davidson's reported failure to
attend important parties, how to pay for an upcoming trip to the
Soviet Union by the National Symphony Orchestra and Davidson being
unreachable by British producer Duncan Weldon, most likely losing
the chance to mount Weldon's productions of Shakespeare's ``Richard
II'' and ``Richard III.''
   Harry McPherson, general counsel to the center, declined to
comment on the report. The newspaper said Davidson declined to
comment.
   The white marble building on the north bank of the Potomac River
houses six theaters and concert stages and provides much of the
cultural activity of the nation's capital.
   The president of the United States appoints 30 of the 45
trustees for 10-year terms; 15 members serve ex-officio,
representing Congress, government agencies and advisory bodies.

<HEAD>Drug `Ice' Could Be Bigger Problem Than Cocaine, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A smokeable drug called ``ice'' is a major
problem in Hawaii and could become a greater threat than cocaine,
officials say.
   ``The ice problem is so bad that crack pales by comparison,''
Honolulu Police Chief Douglas G. Gibb told a House panel Tuesday.
``Ice is cheaper to produce, gives users a very long, steady high,
and is more addictive than heroin.''
   U.S. Attorney Daniel Bent told the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, ``I think we have an epidemic.''
   The hearing focused on the Asian-produced crystalline form of
methamphetamine that has hit Hawaii and some cities on the West
Coast, and on the re-emergence of powdered methamphetamine, known
as ``crank,'' ``speed'' and ``meth.''
   Although ice is more expensive than cocaine, selling for as much
as $7,000 for a full ounce, drug users consider it more economical
because it lasts longer, Bent said. He and Gibb said the high lasts
four to 14 hours.
   San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen said regular methamphetamine
_ which can be smoked and provides the same high as ice, according
to experts _ can be produced for about $1,000 a pound and sold in
bulk for $5,000 a pound. On the street, Burgreen said, one-eighth
of an ounce can sell for as much as $200.
   He said the process to transform regular methamphetamine into
the popular and more expensive ice ``is relatively simple.''
   ``Ice is odorless and can be smoked in public with little danger
of detection,'' Gibb said. ``This factor, as well as the
long-lasting high and the ready availability of the drug, have made
it the drug of choice for on-the-job use in Honolulu.''
   The increase in the drug's popularity is evident not only in the
increase in arrests _ the caseload is up 75 percent over last year
and there are two ice cases for every cocaine case _ but also in
hospital admissions, he said.
   ``Last year, one of Honolulu's major hospitals averaged one ice
overdose a day; this year there have been half a dozen a day,''
Gibb said.
   Since 1985, he said, 32 deaths in Honolulu have been attributed
to ice, while in the first six months of 1989 there were eight
homicides and seven suicides connected to the drug.

<HEAD>Government: Extradition of Drug Traffickers to Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded in the resort city
of Cartagena just hours after the government pledged to resist a
terror campaign and keep extraditing suspected drug traffickers to
the United States.
   The bomb went off late Tuesday in the Bocagrande section of the
city near the Barlovento hotel, injuring two people and causing
extensive damage, the radio network Caracol reported. The hotel is
popular with U.S. tourists.
   Sixteen people have been killed and 201 injured in bombings
blamed on drug gangs since mid-August, when the government launched
its anti-drug campaign and cocaine barons reciprocated with a
declaration of war.
   The State Council, a panel of top government leaders, said
Tuesday that an emergency decree issued Aug. 19 by President
Virgilio Barco allowing extradition to the United States would
continue to be applied.
   The council also said it has no intention of entering
negotiations with traffickers, as some have proposed.
   Barco issued the extradition decree after assassins shot to
death a leading presidential candidate. Colombia's previous
extradition treaty with the United States had been struck down in
the courts.
   Also Tuesday, the bodyguard of a manager for the anti-drug
crusading newspaper El Espectador was fatally shot in western
Medellin. Police said the victim, Pedro Luis Osorio, was a member
of the Medellin police force.
   Osorio was walking to meet a friend for lunch when two men
approached him on a motorcycle and opened fire, a Medellin police
spokesman said by telephone. After killing the bodyguard, police
said, the assassins chased down and murdered his friend, Maria
Ortega, five blocks away.
   The spokesman said the murders resulted from a personal dispute.
   However, hours after the killings, a man claiming to speak for
drug traffickers said in an anonymous phone call that the remaining
11 El Espectador workers in Medellin would be killed if the paper
does not close its bureau in the city, home of the country's most
powerful cocaine cartel.
   The bodyguard had been assigned to protect Luis Bejarano, who
replaced one of the two El Espectador employees killed by gunmen in
Medellin on Oct. 10.
   The State Council _ composed of the president, the chief of
police intelligence, the attorney general and the ministers of
defense, interior and justice _ issued its announcement on the
extraditions following speculation that the Supreme Court had
struck down possible extraditions.
   In rejecting negotiations with the drug cartels the council
said: ``The government has undertaken a policy of combating drug
trafficking and its criminal organizations, and nowhere in this
campaign is there room for either a dialogue or negotiations with
traffickers.
   A message from drug traffickers published by the Bogota
newspaper El Tiempo on Wednesday had asked for talks with the
government to end extraditions if the cocaine bosses agree to
abandon all drug trafficking in Colombia.
   Under Barco's decree, the government has extradited four people
to the United States.
   Although government forces have seized millions of dollars in
alleged assets of drug traffickers since mid-August, they have yet
to capture any of the top cocaine bosses wanted by the United
States.

   The Pentagon is granting a six-month extension
for early design work on the Advanced Tactical Fighter, a program
criticized by House lawmakers.
   While Pentagon and Air Force officials said they were unable to
determine an exact cost for the delay, one report put it between
$250 million and $500 million.
   The ATF is slated to succeed the Air Force F-15 and the Navy
F-14D Tomcat fighter.
   Two design teams are competing to build the aircraft. Northrop
and McDonnell Douglas are building a prototype known as YF-23 while
Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics are constructing a prototype
known as the YF-22.
   With the additional six-month delay, full-scale development of
the plane is not expected to begin before mid-1991.

<NOTE>Report Says 11 Percent of Young People's Deaths Caused by Guns</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report showing guns cause 11
percent of young people's deaths underscores the need to lower
teen-age homicide rates, especially among blacks, Health Secretary
Louis Sullivan says.
   Since 1968, homicide has been the leading cause of death for
black males age 15 to 19. From 1984 to 1987, the rate for that
group jumped 53 percent _ to 60 deaths per 100,000, according to a
report released Tuesday.
   Firearms are responsible for about eight in 10 of these deaths,
the report said.
   The report, ``Firearm Mortality Among Children and Youth,'' was
released in conjunction with the premiere of a television
documentary on youth homicide, produced by the Department of Health
and Human Services. The program is being offered to stations
nationwide.
   ``Just as we have controlled so many childhood diseases, we must
now mount an equally aggressive campaign to rid our children's
lives of the causes and tools of injury and violence,'' Sullivan
said in a statement.
   The National Center for Health Statistics counted 3,392
firearm-related deaths among children age 1 to 19 in 1987 _ about
11 percent of all childhood deaths.

<HEAD>Illegal Landfill Collapses, Buries Shantytown</HEAD>
<UNK>By STAN LEHMAN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An illegal man-made hill collapsed and
buried a shantytown under tons of mud, killing at least three
people and injuring dozens, rescue officials said. Many more were
feared dead.
   ``A wall of earth blanketed the area,'' said Francisco Tenorio
de Albuquerque, a fire official. ``We've rescued a few people, but
there are countless others under the mud.''
   The disaster occurred Tuesday in the Nova Republica slum in
southern Sao Paulo when the 100-foot-high hill of dirt excavated
from construction sites, located illegally near the slum, gave way
and smothered 56 wood and brick shacks, de Albuquerque said.
   Officials said they did not know exactly how many people were
buried in the mudslide. But survivors at the scene said about 400
people lived in the slum neighborhood.
   Geraldo Jacob of the Public Works Department said some houses
were buried under at least 45 feet of dirt.
   ``We heard a loud roar and the ground shook and we ran for the
door,'' Maria dos Prazeres, a survivor, said in a television
interview. ``We just had time to move before the walls came
crashing down on us.''
   Firemen and civil rescue crews arrived shortly after the
disaster and began pulling out victims, de Albuquerque said. The
helmeted workers, aided by residents, dug through layers of reddish
mud with axes, shovels, hoes and their bare hands.
   ``My house was destroyed and I haven't anywhere to go, but thank
God my family and I are still alive,'' said Jose Onofre, 49, a
mechanic who was returning home from a laundromat when the hill
collapsed.
   The injured were treated at a makeshift emergency medical tent.
Survivors were sheltered temporarily in nearby schools and
churches, de Albuquerque said.
   The dirt, about 400,000 cubic yards of it, was illegally dumped
near the shantytowns, Jacob said, adding that the developer
responsible had been fined several times.
   ``It will take at least one week before the full extent of the
tragedy is known,'' Jacob said.
   De Albuquerque said darkness and the remote location made rescue
operations slow and difficult.

<TEXT>
   John Poindexter's daily meetings with
President Reagan on Iran-Contra may entitle the former national
security adviser to subpoena some of the ex-president's notes and
diaries, a federal judge says.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene on Tuesday gave
Poindexter the go-ahead to seek ``relevant'' documents from Reagan.
He set Jan. 22 for Poindexter's trial on charges of conspiracy,
making false statements and obstructing Congress in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Greene said Poindexter will assert in his defense that his
activities were authorized by Reagan, contentions that suggest that
Reagan was far more deeply involved in details of the Iran-Contra
scandal than he has acknowledged.
   Greene rejected a request by Poindexter for permission to
subpoena notes of then-Vice President Bush, saying Poindexter
failed to show that Bush might have authorized his activities. But
the judge held open the possibility that Poindexter might be
allowed to seek documents from Bush later if he can show ``a more
pressing need.''
   ``If the claims'' by Poindexter ``are correct ... there is a
`sufficient likelihood' that the documents sought from President
Reagan would be material to the Poindexter defense,'' the judge
said.
   ``If the defendant submits ... subpoenas ... for specific,
relevant documents in the custody of former President Reagan'' or
the National Archives, ``the court will authorize their issuance,''
Greene said.
   Reagan would have to produce any subpoenaed documents by Nov.
23, but such a subpoena could invoke a claim of executive
privilege. Theodore Olson, a lawyer for the former president,
declined to comment.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed subpoenas for
testimony from Reagan and Bush in the trial of Oliver North, the
former White House aide who worked under Poindexter.
   Poindexter, Greene said, contends that Reagan met with him
``daily, frequently alone'' and that they ``routinely'' discussed
such matters as ``the role of Richard Secord as a middleman in the
transfer of arms to Iran.''
   Poindexter maintains in sealed papers that Reagan was briefed
about a false chronology of the administration's arms sales to Iran
involving four of the criminal charges against Poindexter.
   The chronology stated that no one in the U.S. government knew
before January 1986 that a November 1985 shipment to Iran contained
Hawk missiles. The CIA assisted the shipment without a signed
presidential finding as required by law.
   Poindexter asserts that Reagan, on the inaccurate chronology and
other matters, either ``formulated the administration's position''
or ``entertained Poindexter's plans without voicing any objection.''
   ``It appears that notes were taken by the president and others
on these conversations and, according to the defendant, these notes
or presidential diary entries ... would support his defense to the
charges,'' Greene said.
   Poindexter contends that he and Reagan discussed ``the
administration's view'' of a contemplated House committee inquiry
into the then-secret Contra resupply program operated by North.
   Poindexter is charged with obstructing Congress by encouraging
North to lie in an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting with members of Congress
about assisting the Contras. After the meeting, in which North
denied aiding the rebels, the proposed resolution of inquiry was
shelved.
   Poindexter sent a ``well done'' message to North after the Aug.
6 meeting.
   Greene also said Poindexter maintains he discussed frequently
with Reagan ``the depth of the administration's commitment to the
Contras and its desire to continue to provide military support to
them.''

   A swarm of 40 earthquakes struck the
Yellowstone National Park area, but only two were strong enough to
be felt, geologists said.
   The quakes began at 1:16 p.m. MDT Tuesday and were recorded
during the next nine hours, said Walter Nagy, who monitors
Yellowstone seismic activity for the University of Utah Seismograph
Stations.
   The quakes included two of magnitude 3.5 on the Richter scale of
ground movement, at 9:35 p.m. and 9:36 p.m. These were large enough
to be felt locally, he said.
   The quakes were six miles north of West Yellowstone, Mont.,
along the western boundary of the park.
   They struck within five miles of an extensive swarm sequence in
1985, which included 28 quakes of magnitude 3.5 or greater, Nagy
said.
   He said Tuesday's quakes were at the eastern end of the rupture
zone of the magnitude 7.5 Hebgen quake on Aug. 17, 1959.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area; a 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable
of tremendous damage.
   The Oct. 17 San Francisco Bay area quake measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Joffrey Ballet season at the City Center
opened with what was intended to be a salute to vaudeville. But the
$650,000, 40-minute entertainment isn't ballet, and it isn't a
thoroughgoing giggle to watch, either.
   ``The Pantages and the Palace Present Two-a-Day'' was seen
Tuesday night at the start of a season that runs through Nov. 19.
   After Paul Taylor's ``Arden Court,'' in which dancers looked
bright and sparkling, Gerald Arpino's duet ``Sea Shadow'' and the
New York premiere of ``Two-a-Day,'' a ``Roaring '20s'' supper ball
was held at Roseland.
   This was appropriate since some of ``Two-a-Day'' looked more
like a glitzy production of ``The Boy Friend'' _ the 1954 musical
about the '20s _ than like vaudeville.
   Arpino was inspired to create ``Two-a-Day'' by theaters which
alternated movies and live stage shows. He began with a color film
recreating the ending of the first ``A Star Is Born.'' Then,
presumably, the audience saw the dance part of the live show.
   The program explained who inspired each of eight scenes. Sally
Rand is named for the first, ``Les Plumes.'' With 15 women running
around waving big pink and white fans, it looked more as though
Busby Berkeley was its inspiration.
   There isn't much dancing in ``Two-a-Day,'' but there are a lot
of men carrying women aloft and a lot of just running around the
stage. Six men with top hats and canes were listed as tapdancing.
They did a few novelty steps and one expertly twirled his cane like
a baton.
   In more extreme novelty, Kathryn Ginden wafted about two long
pieces of silk with her arms and poles she held in her hands.
   Bathing beauties in middy tops and shorts formed a kick line.
   A Persian couple seemed like a chance for a dance, but mostly
Tom Mossbrucker carried Julie Janus over his head.
   Six couples spoofing Spanish dancing was close to camp; it was
the liveliest scene and probably the best.
   A girl with bobbed hair arrived from above, seated on a moon,
amid swooning men and was carried around by them before departing
skyward. The mild finale was meant to be a group Charleston.
   Most of the music was composed by Rebekah Harkness.
``Two-a-Day'' was commissioned by David H. Murdock to honor the
office of the president. It was underwritten by Murdock and the
Harkness Foundation for Dance. The premiere was Oct. 10 at Kennedy
Center in Washington.
   We wouldn't really want to see ``Two-a-Day'' again. Maybe there
should have been a couple of comics and a trained dog.

<TEXT>
   Kidnappers holding at least two Americans
have again issued their demand for the release of 15 Shiite Moslem
comrades jailed in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies.
   A statement from Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, was
delivered Tuesday to the independent newspaper An-Nahar and a
Western news agency in Beirut.
   The agency's copy was accompanied by an instant photograph of
American hostage Terry Anderson, who has been held the longest of
the 18 Western hostages. Anderson, abducted March 16, 1985, is
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
   ``We renew our firm emphasis on the need to free our struggling
brethren from the jails of the collaborating Kuwaiti regime, and
declare that the Mujahedeen (holy warriors) shall not rest until
they see their brethren free,'' said the statement, typewritten in
Arabic.
   The photograph of Anderson was similar to one released by
Islamic Jihad on Nov. 4, 1988, with the last statement from the
group, showing Anderson about to cut a birthday cake.
   No cake was visible in the latest picture, a close-up from a
slightly different angle that shows Anderson from the waist up,
mustachioed and smiling, wearing glasses and a yellow T-shirt. In
the background is what appears to be the same blue curtain.
   Anderson turns 42 on Friday. It will be his fifth birthday in
captivity.
   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, of Fort Collins,
Colo., who was acting dean of agriculture at American University of
Beirut when he was abducted June 9, 1985.
   The Shiite Moslems in Kuwait were convicted on terrorist charges
stemming from the 1983 embassy bombings, in which at least five
people were killed and 86 wounded. Three have been condemned to
death, but the sentences have not been carried out. Kuwait has
refused previous demands to release the prisoners.
   With the statement delivered to An-Nahar were two pictures of
the U.S. Marine base and the French paratroop headquarters in
Beirut that were attacked with truck bombs Oct. 23, 1983.
   Islamic Jihad said it issued the statement to mark the
anniversary of the bombings, which killed 241 American military
personnel and 58 French soldiers.
   Like most other Lebanese factions claiming to hold Western
hostages in Lebanon, Islamic Jihad is believed to be a group of
Shiite zealots loyal to Iran.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran offered Monday to help
secure the hostages' release if the United States releases frozen
Iranian assets or helps determine the fate of three Iranians, now
believed dead, kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982.

   The state House approved a strong
abortion control bill that advances Pennsylvania toward becoming
the first state to take advantage of new restrictions allowed by
the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The state Senate delayed discussion of the bill until after it
returns from a two-week break for elections. The state's Democratic
governor, Robert P. Casey, has said he supports new controls on
abortion.
   ``Pennsylvania sent to the nation this message,'' said Rep.
Stephen Freind, a Republican and sponsor of the anti-abortion
proposal. ``Pennsylvania is, Pennsylvania was and Pennsylvania
always will be down the road pro-life.''
   In Lansing, Mich., meanwhile, the Republican-controlled Senate
was to begin debate today on a bill requiring parental consent for
abortion until a woman is 18 years old.
   After nine hours of debate Tuesday, the Pennsylvania House voted
143-58 in favor of a bill that would ban abortions after the 24th
week of pregnancy in most cases. It also would require a 24-hour
waiting period before an abortion; require women to tell their
husbands in most cases if they plan abortions; prohibit
sex-selection abortion; and restrict, but not ban, the use of
tissue from aborted fetuses in scientific research.
   Anti-abortion lawmakers defeated several attempts to weaken the
bill, which Democratic Rep. Karen Ritter, the Legislature's
pro-choice leader, called ``cruel and mean-spirited.''
   ``This is a very sad day in this House and for the women of
Pennsylvania,'' she said.
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania called
passage of the measure ``an unconscionable tragedy.
   ``The state House of Representatives has done the women of
Pennsylvania an unforgiveable and unforgettable injustice,'' said
Sue Frietsche of the ACLU.
   Anti-abortion leaders were jubilant.
   ``It was a good vote in behalf of the women in this state and
for unborn children,'' said Mary Beliveau of the Pennsylvania
Pro-life Federation.
   Pennsylvania's Legislature repeatedly had voted for abortion
controls since the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Anti-abortion efforts were renewed after the U.S. Supreme
Court's July ruling that restored key sections of a Missouri law
restricting the use of public money and facilities in performing
abortions.
   The Florida Legislature, called into special session by Gov. Bob
Martinez earlier this month, rejected all of his proposed abortion
restrictions.
   Last week, a committee of the Illinois House blocked a bill to
restrict abortions.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also
fell.
   The dollar ended at 141.55 yen, down 0.55 yen from Tuesday's
close of 142.10 yen. It opened at 141.57 yen and moved between
141.40 yen and 141.79 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 84.15 points, or 0.24
percent, erasing its 71.90-point gain during the morning session of
trading. It had shed 58.97 points Tuesday.
   Dealers said the index started falling as investors began taking
profits from the early gains, while others stepped off to the
sidelines to wait and see how the New York market performs on
Wednesday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar in Tokyo started lower
following a similar downswing in New York overnight as American
investors sold the currency largely influenced by an 80-point
overnight plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 issues
on Wall Street, traders said.
   The dollar in New York ended at 141.56 yen Tuesday, down from
141.90 yen the previous day.
   Many Japanese market players expect the dollar to fall further,
due to a recent downtrend in U.S. interest rates, said a trader
with a major Japanese commercial bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>One of Guildford Four Says Police Harassed Him After Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of four people freed from prison last week
after a court ruled they were wrongly convicted of a 1974 Irish
Republican Army bombing says police harassed him at gunpoint in
Belfast after his release.
   Legislators Jeremy Corbyn and Chris Mullin of Britain's
opposition Labor Party said today they will question Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government in Parliament about Gerard Conlon's
allegation.
   A unidentified spokesman for the Conlon family was quoted by the
British domestic news agency Press Association as saying Conlon,
35, was badly shaken after police in Belfast stopped a taxi in
which he and family members were traveling Tuesday.
   Police checked the identity papers of the people in the taxi,
the report said, then searched Conlon, a Belfast Roman Catholic, at
gunpoint.
   ``Guns were pointed at him and one ... officer turned and
shouted to a group of others, `This is Conlon,''' the report said.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's predominantly
Protestant police force, said in a statement that if Conlon made an
official complaint, it would be investigated.
   Conlon earlier told reporters: ``After 15 years (in prison),
haven't they done enough to me and my family?''
   Searches by armed police are commonplace in Northern Ireland but
critics allege they are sometimes carried out to harass members of
the minority Catholic community.
   Conlon returned to Belfast after Thursday's ruling in London by
Lord Lane, the country's second-ranking judge, that he and the
other three members of the so-called Guildford Four were wrongly
convicted.
   The four _ Conlon, Patrick Armstrong, Paul Hill, and Carole
Richardson _ were serving life sentences for an Irish Republican
Army bombing at a tavern at Guildford southwest of London on Oct.
5, 1974, that killed five people. They were arrested shortly after
the bombing and tried and convicted in 1975.
   Lane quashed the convictions after a prolonged campaign, ruling
that police officers probably lied to get the four convictions. He
also reversed the convictions of Armstrong and Hill for an IRA
bombing at a tavern in the London suburb of Woolwich on Nov. 6,
1974. Two people died in that blast.
   The government has ordered an inquiry into alleged police
misconduct.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the British out of
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Jim Berkland moonlights as an earthquake
prophet, using theories based on lost pets and lunar tides, but it
may have cost him his job as geologist for the Santa Clara County
Planning Department.
   Berkland complained Tuesday that he got a ``bad rap'' after he
predicted the deadly 7.1-magnitude quake that killed dozens,
injured thousands and caused more than $7.1 billion in damage.
   Berkland's boss, Planning Director Leode Franklin, said she put
him on administrative leave because his reported claims of another
major quake in the Bay area in November were ``generating
unwarranted fear.''
   Berkland, 59, contends he predicted nothing more than a 3.5- to
5.5-magnitude quake between Nov. 11 and Nov. 18.
   ``This is a fantastic situation when I get accused of something
I didn't do,'' Berkland said in a telephone interview from his San
Jose area home.
   The geologist said he has been predicting temblors for 15 years
by studying tides, the movement of the sun and the moon and the
disoriented behavior of dogs, cats, birds and other animals
immediately before an earthquake.
   He said one clue is the large number of lost animal
advertisements printed in papers a week or two before an earthquake.
   Berkland theorizes that animals are far more sensitive than
people to changes in magnetic fields known to occur before quakes,
and when they get disoriented they lose their sense of direction.
   Berkland said his unorthodox methods have generated ridicule
over the years. He got wide attention after the Oct. 17 quake
because he'd said four days earlier that a quake measuring up to 6
on the Richter scale was about to hit.
   Ms. Franklin said Berkland was hired by the county to assess
geologic conditions for land use approvals in unincorporated areas.
   ``My real concern is the public as a whole sees him as a county
official,'' she said, adding that his hobby has interfered with
legitimate geologic assessments.
   If Santa Clara County wants information on potential quakes, Ms.
Franklin said it will rely on the state Office of Emergency
Services and the U.S. Geologic Survey. On Tuesday, the USGS said
there was a 50-50 chance of a major aftershock by Christmas.
   The USGS based its prediction on statistical data from other
quakes in the area and on geologists' observations of the San
Andreas fault. The agency has disputed Berkland's methods.
   Bill Bakun of the USGS said people ``can do just as well by
flipping a coin and be as successful as Jim Berkland'' in
forecasting temblors.
   Berkland claimed that he's been right on 240 of the 300 quakes
he has predicted during the past 15 years.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Governments Killed Tens of Thousands Illegally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government agents in at least two dozen countries
illegally killed tens of thousands of people in 1988 and more than
half the world's governments tortured or mistreated prisoners,
Amnesty International said today.
   The London-based human rights group said in its annual global
survey that human rights were violated in 133 countries last year.
The violations ranged from death squad killings in Latin America to
harassment of church groups in China and mistreatment of jailed
Aborigines in Australia.
   The 310-page report said the victims of deliberate, illegal
killings in at least two dozen countries were government opponents,
members of ethnic or religious groups and civilians living in areas
of military operations.
   It said the victims were gunned down in groups or shot by
snipers, blown up by explosives, stabbed, strangled, hacked to
death or poisoned. Many were tortured to death.
   One-third of the world's governments jailed prisoners of
conscience _ defined by Amnesty as people locked up for the
non-violent exercise of their human rights, the group said.
   And it accused more than half the governments of either
torturing or mistreating prisoners.
   Also, 1,903 prisoners were executed under death penalty laws in
35 countries in 1988, the highest number of such executions since
1981, the report said. Amnesty, winner of the 1977 Nobel Peace
Prize, opposes capital punishment in all circumstances.
   The report was written before many of the sweeping democratic
reforms in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   An accompanying summary touched only briefly on the June killing
of hundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing by Chinese troops as
the government moved to crush the student-led pro-democracy
movement.
   In Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Syria and the Philippines,
victims of illegal killings were often severely mutilated before
being killed, the report said.
   It called those killings, and the killing of hundreds of
civilians by Sri Lanka's security forces, ``striking examples of
continuing extrajudicial executions this year.''
   It said governments made ``enormous efforts'' to conceal
evidence of such killings, but details were reaching the
international community more rapidly than ever before.
   ``Killings are carried out at night, when the victims are alone,
or in remote rural areas where even large-scale troop movements can
be undertaken unobserved,'' the report said.
   ``In urban areas, specialized squads are trained to function in
secrecy and are authorized to conduct operations in areas under
curfew and police control.''
   Amnesty said many such killings occurred during armed conflict
in countries including Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Burma.
   ``Warfare makes it easier to evade accountability; not only is
access by independent observers limited but the dead can be
characterized as combatants ... or as the unavoidable civilian
casualties of war,'' the report said.
   Amnesty said many people became victims simply because they
lived in areas where the overall population was seen as the enemy.
   It said Iraqi forces attacked the Kurdish population with
chemical weapons, deliberately killing some 5,000 men, women and
children in Halabja. Survivors of chemical attacks were often
summarily executed, and in villages near the town of Duhok, more
than 1,000 executions in one day were reported, it said.
   Many killings occurred during or after anti-government
demonstrations, Amnesty said. It expressed concern about the
Israeli-occupied territories where more than 300 Palestinian
civilians were killed in 1988; Algeria where at least 176
demonstrators died; and Tibet, where Chinese police killed dozens
of pro-independence demonstrators.
   Amnesty said it documented prisoners of conscience in at least
76 countries in 1988.
   Among the worst offenders cited were Turkey, where thousands
were detained for political reasons, including hundreds of
prisoners of conscience, and Greece, where conscientious objectors
to military service were in prison.
   However, 1,566 prisoners of conscience were released worldwide
during 1988, or one in every three cases taken up by Amnesty. More
than half the 300 known prisoners of conscience in the Soviet Union
in January 1988 were released by the end of the year.
   Detainees were held without charge or trial in more than 75
countries, and torture and ill-treatment was reported in 94, it
said.

   The disorganized coup in Panama was
muddled by confusion and mixed feelings among officers about the
leader they sought to overthrow, said the highest-ranking survivor
of the attempt.
   Capt. Javier Licona escaped the killings and arrests that
followed the collapse of the Oct. 3 coup because he had been sent
to Fort Clayton during the operation to ask why U.S. troops hadn't
cut off roads or buzzed airports to block loyalists of Panamanian
leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   When the coup began to crumble, Licona remained at Fort Clayton,
the U.S. base in Panama, and eventually was flown with other
refugees to the United States.
   Licona, 36, talked to reporters Tuesday for the first time since
the failed coup. He had declined to speak publicly while he
arranged for relatives to join him and was interviewed by U.S.
officials.
   Licona said the coup's leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, told him
U.S. support was promised at a secret meeting the night of Oct. 1.
   ``But when I arrived (at Fort Clayton) General Cisneros knew
nothing of the support they were supposed to give us,'' Licona
said. Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros is the top U.S. Army official in
Panama.
   After a 20-minute phone call with someone, Cisneros gave the
order to block the roads, Licona said.
   ``Panamanian military planes had already left to transport in
the troops to support General Noriega. It was too late,'' Licona
said.
   Having seized Noriega during the coup attempt, Giroldi seemed
unsure about what to do with him, Licona said.
   ``He remained under Noriega's influence ... He had been very
loyal to the general,'' Licona said. Giroldi wanted Noriega to
leave power peacefully, but said he could remain in Panama, Licona
said.
   Licona said Giroldi failed to make a clear agreement with Maj.
Federico Oleochea, leader of the strongest unit in the capital,
Battalion 2000.
   ``He told me he was sure Major Oleochea would support us the
moment he asked. But he never spoke wwith him concretely about what
he wanted. I never trusted Oleochea,'' he said.
   Oleochea eventually joined Noriega in crushing the coup, Licona
said. Giroldi was slain.

   The United Methodist Church didn't want
its members to work on Sunday so it left its pumpkin stand
unstaffed that day. But that failed to keep would-be customers out
of the pumpkin patch.
   Enter two Catholics _ Judy Martins and her 18-year-old son,
Steven.
   Both had just attended St. Margaret Mary Catholic Church. They
stopped by the patch near the church and were searching for a
couple of likely candidates for jack-o'-lanterns when people
started pressing money into their hands.
   No one seemed to be in charge, so Mrs. Martins and her son
thought they would do a good deed by helping out.
   ``We were still dressed up from church, so I suppose we looked
sort of official,'' she said Monday. ``It was a funny experience.
   ``People just seemed to trust us, but they didn't know me from a
load of hay. It just kind of happened. People were there to buy
pumpkins.''
   After collecting $57 in a half-hour, the Martinses went home and
called the church. They learned it had no plans to staff the stand
that day, so they returned with a lawn chair and a church staffer's
blessing to set up business.
   In three hours, mother and son took in $141, selling pumpkins
from $4 to $12 apiece.
   The Rev. Gordon Ralls, senior pastor at the Methodist church,
said the money would help finance missionary projects sponsored by
the church choir.
   ``I think she was a good Samaritan,'' he said.
   The Martinses had no qualms about working on a Sunday.
   ``If the Methodists don't want to do it, they could hire a few
good Catholics,'' Martins said.

   A wildlife handler is offering
abandoned cats free to anyone who will prove a good home for them.
Problem is, these felines grow to 150 pounds.
   Vernon Yates has accumulated eight cougars at his Wildlife
Rescue and Rehabilitation complex and he's having trouble giving
them away.
   ``I have a very hard time placing cougars _ everybody does,'' he
said.
   He wound up with the big cats as part of his job trapping and
housing unwanted exotic animals.
   ``They make good pets if you understand what you're dealing
with,'' Yates said. `` ... They have the potential to severely hurt
somebody, and, in the case of a small child, kill them.''
   Pet shops sold exotic cats until a couple years ago when
stricter state laws were enacted. ``Anybody could walk into a pet
shop, lay down $1,000 and walk off with a cat,'' said Yates.
   Now, to get a permit to own an exotic cat, the state requires
three years of animal handling experience and a cage that meets
certain specifications.
   ``Some people say that living in a cage isn't necessarily the
best life for a cougar,'' Yates said. ``But it's someplace to go.
I'm trying to keep them from being destroyed.
   ``I believe there are people out there who will love them, even
though they can't pet them.''

   Workers prepared Atlantis
for a weekend piggyback ride on a jet to Florida after finding the
shuttle sustained very little damage to its heat-shield tiles
during its latest space flight.
   ``Everything's going smooth. We're on schedule to depart on
Saturday morning,'' said Lisa Malone, spokeswoman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Atlantis today sat inside a 100-foot-tall steel structure named
the ``mate-demate device'' as workers prepared to mount it atop a
modified Boeing 747 jumbo jet for the return to Kennedy Space
Center.
   Plans now call for the jet to carry the shuttle to Kelly Air
Force Base, near San Antonio for an overnight stop. But there was a
remote possibility the entire trip would be completed Saturday,
said Conrad Nagel, Atlantis processing director.
   Atlantis landed at this Mojave Desert military base Monday
following a five-day flight during which astronauts released the
Galileo spacecraft from the shuttle's cargo bay for a looping
six-year voyage to Jupiter.
   Initial inspection showed only 25 nicks caused by debris that
hit the tiles. Most can be repaired and only six tiles will need to
be replaced, Cindy Lodge, tile manager for the shuttle, said
Tuesday.
   No tiles were lost, she said.
   Inspection of Atlantis' brakes showed they looked ``really
good,'' while the shuttle's tires displayed only ``normal
scuffing,'' Nagel said.
   The mission was Atlantis' fifth, and was the sixth flight for
any shuttle since the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion that destroyed
Challenger and killed its seven crew members.
   The next flight of Atlantis, scheduled for Feb. 10, probably
will be delayed by up to six days because of the six-day delay in
launching the shuttle on the just-completed flight, Nagel said.
   Atlantis is scheduled to perform a classified Defense Department
mission in February.
   Two other shuttle flights are planned for this year.
   Discovery is scheduled for a Nov. 20 launch on a classified
Pentagon mission.
   Columbia, scheduled for launch on a 10-day mission Dec. 20, will
place a Navy communications satellite in orbit, then attempt to
retrieve the $15 million Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite,
which will fall into Earth's atmosphere in February unless it is
plucked from its decaying orbit.
   The satellite contains experiments related to the proposed
``Star Wars'' system to defend the United States against incoming
warheads. The experiments were meant to determine how materials
that might be used in a Star Wars system will fare in the hostile
environment of space.
   The satellite, launched by Challenger in 1984, also contains
millions of tomato seeds, which will be planted on Earth to learn
how weightlessness affects the subsequent growth of the seeds.

   You've seen her on TV. You've read about her
trial in newspapers. Next week, the video: ``The People vs. Zsa Zsa

   The videotape of Miss Gabor's trial for slapping a Beverly Hills
policeman goes on sale nationwide Oct. 31, said Jay Lebow, director
of development for TriCoast International, the producer.
   The 60-minute tape chronicles the Hungarian-born actress's trial
from jury selection to her sentencing to 72 hours in jail Tuesday.
It goes for $9.95.
   More than 500 copies have already been sold in advance to
retailers, Lebow said. ``The interest has been incredible,'' he
said. ``We've only been selling it for a few days.''
   Lebow said the trial was ``real-life `Dynasty,''' and that the
people who'll rent or buy it will be ``people who read `People,'
people who read the `National Enquirer''' and lawyers ``who have an
interest in how the court system is exploited.''
   TriCoast acquired the footage from the one camera allowed inside
the courtroom and the rest from a local video production company.
   ``The video isn't biased,'' Lebow said. `` But I think that most
of the people were against her. They thought that she was caught in
an unfortunate situation then turned it into a media blitz for
herself.''

<HEAD>Methane Levels High in Mine, Inspector Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four of the 10 men killed in an
explosion at a western Kentucky mine were pulled from an area where
dangerous methane levels had been detected four days earlier, a
state official said.
   But the official, testifying Tuesday at a hearing on the Sept.
13 explosion, said the high concentration of the gas alone would
not account for the blast, which caused the worst U.S. mine
disaster since 1984.
   Interviews with workers at the William Station Mine indicated
that tests showed the air in one part of the mine was 6 percent
methane on Sept. 9, said the official, state mining inspector Billy
Smith.
   Methane is considered explosive at levels of 5 percent to 15
percent.
   Workers hung additional fireproof curtains and tightened
existing curtains to allow more air to flow into the mine and
decrease the high methane level. They also assigned a person to
monitor the methane level while they worked in the area, he said.
   ``From what I can find out, they warned oncoming crews they had
detected methane,'' Smith said.
   State investigators are considering several possible causes for
the accumulation of methane, including water that blocked the
mine's primary ventilation system and the absence of a regulator,
or curtain, to control the flow of air through the mine.
   Workers were not required to use the regulator, since mining in
the section had been completed on Sept. 6, and the four workers who
died in the area of high methane concentration were dismantling a
longwall mining machine, Smith said.
   The six other miners were working in another section.
   The explosion may have been sparked by torches believed to have
been in use before the explosion, or by rock falls that may have
caused electric cables to spark, officials said.
   Ron Siler, president of Pyro Mining Co., said officials did not
learn of the high methane level until after the explosion.
   Attorneys for widows of miners killed in the blast questioned
state and company officials knew about a partition that was removed
about 15 minutes before the explosion.
   Federal investigators have said tearing down the barrier may
have altered the air flow in the mine, allowing the explosive
methane gas to accumulate.
   Smith testified, however, that the partition was about 5,400
feet away from the explosion area and was unlikely to have affected
the level of methane in the blast area.
   Methane gas is given off as coal is mined. Smith said any
accumulation of the gas usually clears out of an area within two
days after mining ceases.

   Legislation adopted late Tuesday by the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives would impose more
restrictions on women seeking abortions.
   The bill would:
   _ Ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except to save
the mother's life and in cases where ``substantial and irreversible
impairment of major bodily function'' was threatened.
   _ Require a 24-hour waiting period before obtaining an abortion.
   _ Require a woman to tell her husband if she plans to get an
abortion unless the husband is not the father of the fetus, the
husband cannot be located, the pregnancy is the result of spousal
rape that has been reported to the police, or if telling the
husband would put the woman in danger of abuse.
   _ Prohibit sex-selection abortions.
   _ Permit experimentation with tissues from aborted fetuses only
with the permission of the woman who had the abortion.
   _ Require physicians to test for the fetal age before doing an

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said today that a Puerto
Rican nationalist in lengthy pre-trial detention and a former Black
Panther sentenced to life on a murder conviction may have been
shortchanged by the U.S. justice system.
   In its annual global survey, the human rights organization
reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and said the 11
prisoners executed in the United States last year raised the total
since 1977 to 104.
   The death row population grew to an unprecedented 2,182
prisoners in 34 states by the end of 1988, it said.
   Amnesty International raised concerns about Filberto Ojeda Rios,
a Puerto Rican independence supporter held in pre-trial detention
in Connecticut for 32 months on armed robbery charges.
   A federal court ordered his release on bail in May 1988, saying
``due process cannot tolerate any further pre-trial detention.''
   However, he was arrested again three months later and charged
with a new offense of assault relating to his original arrest in
1985. Ojeda Rios was denied bail and again placed in detention.
   Amnesty said he was held ``in virtual incommunicado detention''
with only limited access to lawyers.
   It expressed concern that Ojeda Rios' lengthy pre-trial
detention may have undermined his right to be tried within a
reasonable period or else be released.
   The human rights group also said it asked Gov. George Deukmejian
of California to order an inquiry into the case of a former member
of the Black Panther Party serving a life sentence in California
for a 1972 murder conviction.
   Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt may have been denied a fair trial
because of his political activities, Amnesty said.
   It said new evidence obtained after Pratt's trial indicated he
was targeted for ``neutralization'' by the FBI between 1968 and
1971 because of his political activities.
   It said the evidence also revealed the chief prosecution witness
was an FBI informant and that the FBI planted informers in Pratt's
defense teams.
   A 1985 court hearing dismissed Pratt's motion for a new trial,
ruling that the chief prosecution witness had been an FBI contact,
not an informer, and that Pratt had not suffered as a result of the
surveillance on his defense team.
   In June 1988, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal also turned down
his appeal on technical grounds.
   Amnesty said Deukmejian told them he was without the
``authority, ability and resources'' to order an inquiry.
   On other matters, Amnesty said it investigated reports that
prisoners in several state prisons had been ill-treated, including
the Michael Unit of the Texas Department of Corrections where
guards allegedly beat prisoners who were handcuffed and kept in leg
irons.
   The warden of Michael Unit informed Amnesty that no such
incidents had occurred, the report said.
   Amnesty said it also looked into reports that prisoners in the
Administrative Control Unit of the Southern Ohio Correctional
Facility were shackled and chained to cell fixtures. Others were
alleged to have been sprayed with mace and high-pressure water and
left in empty, unheated cells for several days.
   Prison authorities denied that prisoners had been ill-treated
but admitted that shackles, chains and mace were used for
restraining purposes, Amnesty said.
   The international human rights organization said it also
concluded that conditions in the High Security Unit of Kentucky's
Lexington Federal Prison were substandard. The unit has since been
closed.

   A man accused of discrimination for
denying housing to an unmarried couple will grudgingly pay a $700
fine with $1 contributions from supporters while he waits for a
ruling on his appeal, his lawyer said.
   The donations for Layle French came from around the country,
said the attorney, James Anderson.
   French, 33, was fined $1,048 on June 7 by an administrative law
judge who said French violated the state's anti-discrimination law
when he reneged on an agreement to rent his former house to Sue
Parsons.
   Parsons planned to live in the house with her fiance. French
later decided it would be against his religion to rent to an
unmarried couple.
   Anderson said French willingly paid the $348 portion of the fine
to reimburse Parsons for having to change her plans. But he
appealed the $700 civil penalty to the state Court of Appeals.

<TEXT>
   The 82-year-old lawyer who represented
Jim Bakker through much of his fraud and conspiracy trial doesn't
expect to be paid soon by the PTL founder, but relishes the
publicity.
   ``Every case I've ever had has been a heart-stopper,'' said
George T. Davis, who has been practicing law for more than five
decades. ``Those are the only kinds of cases I take.''
   Davis gained reknown representing legendary labor leader Tom
Mooney and since has represented accused Nazi war criminals,
political prisoners, death row inmates and deposed foreign leaders.
   He arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday to represent Rudy Tham, a
convicted Teamster embezzler who allegedly conspired with U.S.
District Judge Robert Aguilar to gain a reversal of his conviction.
   Aguilar has been charged with using his San Jose, Calif.,
judicial office in a racketeering enterprise, in only the fourth
indictment to be returned against a federal judge this decade and
the first time the Racketeering Influence, Corrupt Organizations
Act has been used against a federal judge.
   Davis, who sparred with U.S. District Judge Robert Potter
throughout Bakker's trial, said Bakker had released him from
serving as his attorney during the sentencing.
   Asked if Bakker had paid him, Davis said, ``How can I describe
my compensation? ... He assures me that some day it will be taken
care of.''
   Davis said Bakker had been unfairly convicted.
   ``This case was tried in a lynch mob orientation,'' Davis said
in a telephone interview. ``The only difference between an old
fashioned Southern (lynching) and this one is that the victim is
still alive.''
   The case that sealed Davis' reputation, at the age of 32, was
his appeal on behalf of labor organizer Mooney, convicted of a 1916
bombing in San Francisco.
   It was widely believed that Mooney had been framed, and when he
was pardoned in 1939, thousands cheered as Mooney and Davis paraded
through San Francisco.

   Police rescued a 17-month-old child
found tottering in the middle of a busy street and charged his
parents and babysitter with child neglect.
   Edward Crawford was not injured when Detective Thomas Jackson
spotted the toddler Tuesday morning.
   Edward's older brother, Sam Baker, 4, also had wandered away and
was found later a block away in another busy area, authorities said.
   James Crawford and Melinda Baker were charged with child neglect
and were being held in jail Tuesday night under $500 bonds.
   The babysitter, Melanie Lashbrook, was charged with child
neglect and released on bond. She also was wanted on contempt
charges for not showing up in court on a prostitution citation.
   Lashbrook was sleeping with a third child, 2-month-old Joshua
Crawford, when the two older boys wandered away, said Youth
Guidance Officer Regenia Blanton.
   ``We were called out on a lost child and when we arrived we
realized a child had been found in the middle of Shelby Street,''
Blanton said.
   After the children were safe, police pounded on Lashbrook's
apartment door and woke her up, police said.
   The three children have been placed in the custody of the state
Department of Human Services.
   The parents came from Olean, N.Y., several weeks ago to visit
friends here, Blanton said. When their car broke down, they were
forced to stay with the friends, who live in Lashbrook's building,
until they could raise enough money to fix their car.

<HEAD>State Radio Says Soviets Could Help Persuade ANC To Negotiate</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union could play an
important role in helping to initiate talks between South Africa's
white government and its black adversaries, state radio said today.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp., in a commentary, said the
Soviet Union was the only major power with influence over the
African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The ANC has said it will neither halt its use of violence nor
enter negotiations until the government legalizes it, frees all
political prisoners, ends the 40-month-old state of emergency and
lifts restrictions on opposition activity. The government says the
ANC is welcome to enter negotiations if it commits itself to
peaceful solutions.
   ``While it must be stressed that the Soviet Union ... will
remain the main supplier of weapons to the ANC as long as it
decides to continue its program of violence, the Soviet Union is
nevertheless now publicly urging the ANC to take part in a
political, or negotiated, settlement,'' the radio commentary said.
   ``There is a clear need for all sides to concentrate less on
preconditions and to get down to initial talks about the
negotiations that they must eventually take part in,'' the
commentary said. ``The Soviet Union could play an important role as
a facilitator in working with other parties to loosen the current
logjam.''
   President F.W. de Klerk has offered to negotiate a new
constitution which would extend political rights to the black
majority, although he envisions a system in which whites would
retain veto power over major decisions.
   In a series of steps aimed at promoting talks, de Klerk has
eased restrictions on mass protests, conferred with anti-apartheid
activists and freed unconditionally eight long-term political
prisoners, including seven ANC leaders.
   The freed ANC men have spoken forthrightly in support of their
organization, including its use of violence, and they are to
address a government-approved mass rally Sunday. Nevertheless, Law
and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has denied the ANC has been tacitly
legalized.
   The ANC will remain banned ``as long as it refuses to commit
itself to peaceful development,'' Vlok said Tuesday. ``The South
African Police will continue to stop the organization in its
tracks.''
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the far-right Conservative Party,
said in a speech Tuesday night that the government was obsessed
with the concept of negotiation, at the expense of white
sovereignty.
   De Klerk's National Party ``insults our nationality and chases
us up the path of black domination under the flag of consensus and
reconciliation,'' said Treurnicht, whose party won 31 percent of
the white vote in parliamentary elections last month.
   ``We will rather make do with a smaller white area than with one
under an ANC government,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The leader of Ghana, Flight Lt.
Jerry Rawlings, has dismissed the only woman on the country's
ruling Provisional National Defense Council, state radio said.
   The report Tuesday on Accra Radio, monitored here, said Rawlings
fired Mrs. Aanaa Enin ``on the grounds of continued acts of
disrespect against members of the public and officials as well as
other conduct incompatible with revolutionary humility.'' No other
details were available.
   With Mrs. Aanaa the council had nine members. There was no word
on whether she would be replaced.
   Rawlings took power in a coup Dec. 31, 1981, set up the
Provisional National Defense Council and banned political parties.
    Last month Rawlings relieved Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo as head of
the West African nation's military, taking personal command.
Quainoo kept his position on the ruling council.
   Earlier this month Rawlings' government announced that several
military officers were being questioned in connection with an
investigation into conduct that could threaten state security.
   In 1957, Ghana became the first British colony in Africa to gain
   independence. The three civilian and four military governments
that preceded Rawlings' ended in coups.

   The law slapped back at Zsa Zsa
Gabor with a three-day jail term for slapping a policeman, ending a
circuslike case that left the actress unrepentant and her husband
fuming.
   ``Yes, I'm upset,'' said Miss Gabor's eighth husband, Frederick
von Anhalt, as he stormed down the steps of the courthouse after
Tuesday's sentencing. ``I will ask the court if I can go to jail
instead of my wife.''
   Miss Gabor, a one-time Hungarian beauty queen believed to be in
her mid-60s to early 70s, snickered, smiled and made quips as
Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles Rubin announced the sentence,
peppering his statements with rebukes and warnings.
   ``Now you laugh,'' the judge said, before lecturing Miss Gabor
about the 25,000 Americans who die yearly in alcohol-related
accidents. Among Miss Gabor's misdemeanor convictions was driving
with an open container of alcohol.
   ``The law applies to everyone, whether they are rich or poor and
whether they are famous or not,'' Rubin said before sentencing her.
``In the absence of extremely mitigating circumstances ... if you
strike a cop, you go to jail.''
   Along with the jail term, the judge ordered Miss Gabor to pay
$12,937.50 in fines and restitutions and to perform 120 hours of
community service in a women's homeless shelter, where she may not
talk about her case or give media interviews. Miss Gabor, who
returned home after the verdict, was given until Dec. 29 to
complete the jail sentence.
   She also was ordered to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and to
refrain from driving until she gets her real age on her driver's
license. During the trial, Miss Gabor claimed the license was
stolen and altered by someone else.
   The judge repeatedly attacked Miss Gabor's demeanor inside and
outside of court, saying she was ``milking this case for
publicity'' at the expense of the taxpayers who paid for the trial.
   ``She has demonstrated an attitude continually of contempt for
law and order and these proceedings, without a hint of remorse or
contrition of any kind,'' the judge said. ``And that is very
relevant to sentencing.''
   As Miss Gabor left the courtroom, she disputed the judge's
contention that she not only slapped a police officer, but the
American people by her statements out of court that the United
States was worse than the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
   ``I'm a very good American. I love America,'' she said. ``Why
should I slap the face of America?''
   Miss Gabor, star of such B-films as ``Queen of Outer Space'' and
``Picture Mommy Dead,'' faced a maximum of 18 months in jail, and
the judge warned that she could get more jail time if she violated
her parole.
   The tempestuous celebrity slapped Officer Paul Kramer on June 14
after he stopped her Rolls-Royce convertible. The actress testified
she instinctively struck Kramer after he roughed her up. Kramer
overreacted, she said, and used undue force in arresting her.
   Besides the alcohol offense, a jury convicted Miss Gabor on
Sept. 29 of battery on a police officer and driving without a valid
driver's license. She was acquitted of failing to obey an officer.
All the charges were misdemeanors.
   ``When she was first convicted, we felt that the police
department and Officer Kramer were vindicated,'' said Lt. Robert
Curtis, a police spokesman. ``We certainly feel that this
(sentence) is even further vindication.''
   The trial drew more than 100 reporters, camera crews and
photographers from throughout the world.
   The sentencing attracted a Zsa Zsa Gabor look-a-like, a man who
wrote a poem for the trial, several people wearing ``Fry Zsa Zsa''
buttons, a man with ``John 3:16'' on a T-shirt and numerous
tourists with pocket cameras.
   After the sentencing, a three-piece band played a drum roll as
von Anhalt walked down the court steps, then later played a song
written for the trial, with lyrics that included: ``Zsa Zsa, she's
going to jail. She's paying some fines now.''

   Edward Ware Barrett, a leading figure in
American journalism who founded the Columbia Journalism Review, has
died after a long illness. He was 79.
   Barrett died Monday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. He had
been inactive since suffering a stroke five years ago.
   In addition to establishing the Review in 1962, Barrett served
as dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism from
1956 to 1968.
   Barrett was ``the quintessential dean who set the standards for
the school and brought it to great heights,'' said Fred W.
Friendly, director of the Columbia Seminars on Media and Society.
``No one in my lifetime has contributed more to journalists'
understanding of journalism.''
   Norman Isaacs, one-time chairman of the now-defunct National
News Council, said, ``Ed Barrett was one of the great pioneers in
trying to lead American journalism into public accountability.''
   Barrett was born July 3, 1910, in Birmingham, Ala., the son of
the editor-publisher of the Birmingham Age-Herald. A 1932 Princeton
graduate, he worked briefly for CBS before joining Newsweek as a
researcher-writer in 1933.
   He became Washington correspondent, national editor and
associate editor for Newsweek, staying there until joining the war
effort in 1942 as chief of what became the Office of Strategic
Services.
   He went back to Newsweek from 1946 to 1950 before returning to
government service as assistant secretary of state.
   Columbia Journalism Review was the first national magazine
devoted to journalistic criticism. He was publisher and editorial
chairman from 1975 through 1982, when he became publisher emeritus.
   He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Mason, and two
daughters, Margo, of New York City, and Lisa, of Burlington, Vt.
The funeral service will be Friday at 4 p.m. in Greenwich, Conn.,
with Friendly delivering the eulogy.
   The family has asked for contributions to the Edward W. Barrett
Fund at the Columbia Journalism Review in lieu of flowers.

<TEXT>
   Sunny, warm conditions lingered in much of the nation today.
   Indian summer prevailed across the central third of the country
Tuesday as brisk southerly winds helped temperatures warm into the
70s and 80s across the Great Plains and the Mississippi Valley.
   Readings of 80 degrees were reported as far north as southern
Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota.
   Fifteen cities in the north-central United States tied or broke
the record highs for the date, including a high of 74 in
International Falls, Minn., dubbed ``The Nation's Icebox'' because
of its bitterly cold winters.
   Al Voelker, a National Weather Service spokesman in Fargo, N.D.,
where the mercury climbed to a record 78, said goose hunters might
be disappointed because the heat might prevent geese from flying
low enough to hunt, adding:
   ``It seems a lot hotter than what it is. When you get used to
40-degree weather, it seems hotter.''
   The warm weather spread to the East with highs mostly in the 60s
and 70s, though temperatures remained in the 50s in parts of Maine.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the Florida
Peninsula as well as southern Texas. Rain lingered in southwestern
Oregon and northern California, with snow in the highest
elevations. Half-inch hail was reported with a thunderstorm at Red
Bluff, Calif.
   Clouds and scattered showers prevailed behind a cold front
crossing the northern Plains. Clouds covered much of the nation
west of the Rockies.
   Temperatures warmed into the 80s and low 90s in the desert
Southwest. Cool, blustery weather prevailed across much of the rest
of the West.
   The nation's high on Tuesday was 92 degrees at Borrego Springs,
Calif.

   Times Mirror Co. said that its third-quarter earnings fell 13.5
percent from a year earlier, while Knight-Ridder Inc., Washington
Post Co. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. reported earnings increases.
   Knight-Ridder reported Tuesday that its third-quarter earnings
rose 18.2 percent, Washington Post reported a 17.7 percent increase
and LIN Broadcasting a 19.4 percent rise.
   Times Mirror, the Los Angeles-based media and information
company, said earnings fell to $70.1 million, or 54 cents a share,
in the three months ended Oct. 1 from $81 million, or 62 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   But the 1988 earnings included a $26.5 million one-time gain on
the sale of timberland assets.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 7.2 percent to $873.9 million from
$814.8 million a year earlier.
   ``Softness in advertising volume, primarily at our Eastern
newspapers, continues to adversely affect newspaper publishing
revenues and operating profits despite improved results at the Los
Angeles Times,'' said Robert F. Erburu, Times Mirror chairman and
chief executive.
   Times Mirror also publishes Newsday, New York Newsday, the
Baltimore Sun newspapers, The Hartford Courant, The Morning Call in
Allentown, Pa., The (Stamford, Conn.) Advocate and Greenwich
(Conn.) Time.
   Erburu said strong results at the company's cable television and
professional publishing companies and improvement in broadcast
television partly offset the decline in newspapers.
   Knight-Ridder, the newspaper and business information company
based in Miami, said it earned $37.8 million, or 72 cents a share,
in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $32 million, or
57 cents a share, a year ago.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 7.5 percent to $541 million from
$503.1 million a year earlier.
   The operating profit at the newspaper division rose 19.5 percent
to $78.4 million, while the business information services division
had an operating profit of $2.5 million, up about fivefold from a
year earlier.
   Robert F. Singleton, chief financial officer, attributed the
earnings gain to ``softer newsprint prices, strong cost controls, a
lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding.''
   The latest results also included a $4.2 million gain on the sale
of TV stations KTVY in Oklahoma City and WJRT in Flint, Mich.
   Knight-Ridder owns 29 daily newspapers including The Miami
Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Detroit Free Press and San

share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 9.9 percent to $1.66 billion from $1.51
billion a year earlier.
   Washington Post Co., publisher of The Washington Post and
Newsweek magazine, said it earned $44.8 million, or $3.50 a share,
in the third quarter, up from $38.1 million, or $2.96 a share, a
year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 5.2 percent to $346.3 million from
$329.4 million a year earlier.
   For the first nine months, Washington Post earned $146.8
million, or $11.44 a share, down 36.6 percent from $232.2 million,
or $18.04 per share, a year earlier.
   LIN Broadcasting, a cellular telelphone, television and
specialty publishing concern based in New York, said earnings rose
to $24.6 million, or 46 cents per share, in the quarter compared
with $20.6 million, or 39 cents a share, a year ago.

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Votes to Deny Communists Guaranteed Seats in Pa2liament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top
Communists would have to campaign for their parliamentary seats in
local districts in 1994, much as the British prime minister does,
if the legislature gets its way.
   The constitutional change throwing all seats in parliament up
for popular election was approved by the Supreme Soviet Tuesday in
a 254-to-85 vote. However, it must be confirmed by the
legislature's parent body, the Congress of People's Deputies, which
meets at the end of the year.
   The change, part of a package of constitutional amendments
approved Tuesday, denies the Communist Party and other special
interests their guaranteed seats.
   Last year's political reform allocated 100 seats to the
Communist Party, which filled them by allowing the leadership to
select just 100 candidates.
   That allowed Gorbachev and most of the ruling Politburo to be
seated in Congress without facing a public vote of confidence.
   The Supreme Soviet, the 542-member full-time legislature, did
not require Gorbachev to mount a national campaign to win
re-election to the presidency, although some deputies had suggested
a direct election. That post will continue to be filled by the
Congress from among its members.
   The decision by no means restricts the Communist Party from
running candidates for geographical seats. Currently, 80 percent of
the 2,250 deputies are Communist Party members.
   Last year's political reform gave Soviet voters their first real
selection of candidates. But the election system was complex and
many people complained that the process was undemocratic and
favored the status quo.
   Two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies in the Congress were elected
from geographical districts. The other one-third were elected by
social organizations, and the reform package promised 100 seats
each to the Communist Party, the official trade unions and
cooperative organizations.
   The package allocated 75 seats each to the Komsomol (Communist
Youth League), to creative unions and to groups of women, academics
and veterans.
   The last 75 were split among smaller groups, with one seat even
going to an association of stamp collectors.
   Progressives complained that the system violated the principle
of one person, one vote. They said members of these organizations
had the opportunity to vote in each group as well as in their
geographical district.
   In practice, key reform groups such as the Baltic people's
fronts and groups of new private business cooperatives were shut
out of the privileged group in favor of long-standing agricultural
cooperatives and organizations controlled by the Communist Party.
   In one case, however, the prestigious Academy of Sciences capped
a stormy series of elections by choosing a slate of reformers that
included human rights activist Andrei Sakharov.
   The Supreme Soviet also decided Monday to allow the republics of
the Soviet Union to make their own decisions on whether their
presidents will be elected directly by the public or by their
legislatures.
   Although the Congress is supposed to handle final approval of
constitutional amendments, the legislators speeded up their vote
because a number of the republics are scheduled to adopt new
election laws this week that depend on the national amendments, the
official Tass news agency said.

   While applauding the Soviet admissions of past
mistakes, some Bush administration officials are concerned that the
Kremlin may be engaged in a sophisticated campaign to weaken U.S.
resolve on key foreign and defense policies.
   The administration's public response Tuesday to the speech by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was decidedly
favorable, with spokesmen using words such as ``extraordinary'' and
``striking'' to describe the Soviet diplomat's statements.
   In a speech Monday, Shevardnadze condemned the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan in 1979 and, in effect, said the United States was
correct in contending that a controversial radar station in Siberia
violated bilateral agreements.
   But one U.S. official, speaking anonymously, said Shevardnadze's
statements on Afghanistan may have been aimed at rallying U.S.
public opinion against continued U.S. military involvement in
Afghanistan.
   The United States has been providing substantial assistance to
the Afghan rebels and encouraging them not to enter peace
negotiations with the pro-Moscow regime in Kabul.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler welcomed
Shevardnadze's admission that the invasion had set the Soviet Union
``against all of humanity'' but she added that the Kremlin should
do more to erase its mistakes.
   Specifically, she encouraged the Soviets to transfer power from
the ``illegitimate'' government in Afghanistan to a ``government
acceptable to all the Afghan people.''
   ``The legacy of the Soviet invasion continues as long as the
current Kabul regime retains power in the face of a determined
effort by the Afghan people and the international community to see
it removed,'' she said.
   The Afghan war has continued to rage even though the Soviets
completed their troop pullout eight months ago.
   According to U.S. estimates, the Soviets have been airlifting
$250 million to $300 million worth of arms a month to Kabul. Soviet
military involvement in Afghanistan, among other regional
conflicts, was perhaps the main area of disagreement during
Shevardnadze's talks last month with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in Wyoming.
   The administration was clearly elated over Shevardnadze's
remarks on the Krasnoyarsk radar site.
   Ms. Tutwiler said: ``We have long maintained that the radar is a
violation of the ABM treaty. We therefore welcome Mr.
Shevardnadze's statement just as we welcomed the Soviet decision in
September to completely eliminate that radar.''
   Other officials, insisting on anonymity, expressed concern that
the Soviets might try to parlay their mea culpas over the radar
issue into a campaign aimed at reversing U.S. public support for
the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said in a television
interview today that the speech was almost certainly aimed at
giving the Soviets leverage against the space-based missile defense
system.
   ``One of the motives, I am sure, is to make it more difficult
for us to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, which we should do,''
Weinberger said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program. `` And
so this is part of the Soviet pattern of trying to prevent us from
proceeding with President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.''
   The United States had argued that the Soviets could have
utilized the Krasnoyarsk radar to develop a first strike capability
against U.S. targets. The Soviets have used the same argument in
opposing SDI.
   One official said Shevardnadze's statements on the Krasnoyarsk
site have immense ``propaganda potential'' if they weaken U.S.
resolve to push ahead with the SDI program.
   The official added he believes it is essential for the United
States to proceed with the program, contending that the Soviets
themselves have their own SDI project under way.
   Still, the administration seemed pleased at the overall tone of
Shevardnadze's remarks and suggested that they bode well for the
future.
   ``They're extraordinary,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. He called Shevardnadze's candor ``a step in the right
direction'' for arms control.
   Ms. Tutwiler called Shevardnadze's statements ``strikingly
forthright admissions'' of past Soviet mistakes.
   ``They reflect new thinking and they demonstrate the Soviet
acknowledgement of the importance of being honest about past Soviet
policy,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A senior California transportation
engineer told a seismic workshop four years ago there was no need
to strengthen freeway columns until future earthquakes proved them
vulnerable, state documents show.
   Ray J. Zelinski, head of the freeway retrofitting program for
the state Department of Transportation, said the strengthening
wasn't necessary because the state's project to tie roadbeds
together with steel cables provided enough stability in an
earthquake, according to the documents released Monday by the
department.
   Some structural engineers have criticized California's
transportation department for not strengthening the columns on
Oakland's double-decked Nimitz Freeway, which collapsed during the
Oct. 17 earthquake, killing more than three dozen people. The
freeway's roadbeds were tied together.
   The cause of the collapse is still undetermined, however.
   ``It should be noted,'' Zelinski said in a paper delivered at
the 1985 workshop in New Zealand, ``that column retrofits have been
avoided by designing restraining features in a manner which
circumvents collapse due to column damage.
   ``Review of behavior of retrofitted bridges during earthquakes
will determine whether features will need improvement and whether
columns need to be considered for retrofitting,'' he said.
   Zelinski has been ordered by state transportation officials and
attorneys not to comment on his earlier remarks.
   However, James E. Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structures
division, said Zelinski still believes the roadbed tie-down system
should be enough to prevent failures, although the freeway's
collapse ``shakes his faith a little.''
   Roberts said he thought the tie-down project has been highly
effective.
   The state's program to strengthen columns through retrofitting
also may have been delayed in part because Zelinski and other
engineers did not believe it was necessary, said Roberts. ``That
tells you about why we haven't seen the need to move ... faster.''
   Also Tuesday, a former state bridge designer charged that the
Nimitz Freeway, which opened in 1957, was not built to the highest
standards of the time.
   Jim See, who is now the public works director for the city of
Pleasant Hill, said the freeway's columns were not sufficiently
reinforced with horizontal steel supports.
   Roberts said his staff is investigating See's allegations.

<TEXT>
   Novelist Salman Rushdie denied a newspaper's claim
that he misled his publisher about the likely impact his novel
``The Satanic Verses'' would have on the Moslem world.
   In a letter published today in The Independent, Rushdie accuses
the daily of telling a ``blatant untruth'' in a profile it
published Saturday of Peter Mayer, head of Viking Penguin
publishers.
   Rushdie has been in hiding for eight months since the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Moslems to kill him for
allegedly blaspheming their faith.
   The threat also extends to Rushdie's publishers, and The
Independent's profile said Mayer ``has been forced to spend weeks
slipping through shadows.''
   It said that when Mayer first read the book, he ``missed the
religious time bomb ticking inside its covers.''
   ``Rushdie was asked twice, once before Penguin bought the book
and again afterward, what the now notorious Mahound chapter was
supposed to mean,'' The Independent wrote.
   ``He seemed curiously reluctant to explain. `Don't worry,' he
said at one point. `It's not terribly important to the plot.'''
   In his letter, Rushdie wrote: ``This passage is a lie. As
Penguin editorial staff in London and New York know, I discussed
the background to `The Satanic Verses' fully, answering all
questions.''
   He said he had ``failed to anticipate the distortions and
falsifications to which my novel was subsequently subjected.'' But
he insisted it was ludicrous to suggest he had dismissed some 75
pages of the novel as unimportant to the plot.
   ``The implication that I deceived Viking Penguin is wholly
unjustified, and, in the present circumstances, injurious.
Character assassination is also a sort of murder,'' Rushdie wrote.
   ``I am acutely conscious of Peter Mayer's present anguish ... as
I'm sure he is of mine,'' he wrote.
   Rushdie also took issue with the newspaper's suggestion that
since he had ``nothing to lose'' he was pressuring Penguin to
produce a paperback version of ``The Satanic Verses,'' despite the
danger that this would further inflame Moslem hostility.
   ``I'd like to think that your readers found the description of
my present situation ... more than a little distasteful,'' he wrote.
   The letter was dated Oct. 23 and gave no indication of where it
was written.

   NBC won back first place in the Nielsen
television ratings as the San Francisco Bay area earthquake delayed
the World Series and ABC's prospects for another victory.
   The quake altered all three networks' schedules last week in one
of the more inconsequential results of the disaster.
   Instead of an anticipated second week on top, ABC fell to third
place. The network was caught without alternative programming when
its biggest night of the week, Tuesday, was pre-empted first by the
World Series pregame show and then by coverage of the earthquake.
   The quake hit just as ABC's coverage of the third game between
the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics was beginning in
San Francisco's Candlestick Park. The Tuesday night pregame show
tied for 44th place. ABC had won the ratings race the previous week
on the basis of the first two games, snapping NBC's record 68-week
string of first-place finishes.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was first last week, closely followed by ``The
Cosby Show.'' ABC's highest-ranked show was its Monday Night
Football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Buffalo Bills,
which was 10th.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with a weekly primetime
average of 14.1. CBS had a 12.6 and ABC 12.1. The ratings represent
the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million households tuned into a
program.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers;'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show;''
NBC's ``A Different World;'' NBC's ``Golden Girls;'' NBC's ``Dear
John'' and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' tied for fifth; NBC's ``Empty
Nest;'' NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and the CBS movie ``Do You
Know the Muffin Man?'' tied for eighth; and ABC's Monday Night NFL
Football.
   The World Series is not scheduled to resume until Friday,
depending on weather and repairs to the ballpark.
   The networks' special coverage of the earthquake was not ranked
by Nielsen because it was unscheduled and not sponsored. The
network evening news shows had nearly 5 million extra viewers,
apparently because of the quake.
   Here's how the networks did with follow-up coverage of the
earthquake: ABC's ``20-20'' in a tie for 20th place, CBS' ``48
Hours'' 29th, ABC News special report 34th, ABC's ``PrimeTime
Live'' in a tie for 37th place, and NBC's special report 43rd.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' led the evening news shows with a
rating of 11.5. CBS had an 11.2 and NBC 10.7. CBS was rated for
only four nights because the night of the earthquake it had
pre-empted its West Coast news feed for special coverage.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet foreign minister met jointly
with Communist Party officials and one of their harshest foes today
and said later his country is determined to maintain good relations
with both sides.
   Eduard Shevardnadze also emphasized the need to clear up ``blank
spots'' in the countries' history. One such ``blank spot'' is a
World War II massacre of Polish officers, for which Soviet forces
have generally been blamed.
   Shevardnadze met for more than an hour with the Communist
Party's first secretary, Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, and then invited
Adam Michnik to join them. Michnik is editor in chief of the
pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza daily and spent nearly five years in
jail for his opposition activites.
   Michnik, a close adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and
perhaps Poland's best-known critic of one-party rule, was the only
reporter allowed into the room. The three talked for about 10
minutes before Shevardnadze came out.
   Shevardnadze told reporters he is willing to meet with ``every
party, with anybody'' and said the Soviet Union wants close
relations with both the Communist Party and with Poland's new
government, which is led by Solidarity.
   Speaking of ``blanks spots'' in Polish-Soviet history,
Shevardnadze promised they would be cleared up.
   ``We want only the truth. It is needed by our two nations and is
in the interest of friendship,'' he said.
   Asked how much change the Soviet Union would tolerate in Poland,
he responded: ``We don't set up order in other countries. Would you
want it to be so?''
   Shevardnadze arrived in Poland on Tuesday and, as a sign of
goodwill, promised that Moscow will maintain fuel deliveries
crucial to Poland's survival.
   He also met Tuesday with Taduesz Mazowiecki, the East bloc's
first non-Communist prime minister, and the two announced that
Mazowiecki will visit Moscow next month.
   The Kremlin has said it views the radical political changes in
Poland to be an internal matter. Its decision to allow Poland and
Hungary to chart an independent course marked a significant shift
in Soviet policy toward its East bloc allies.
   Mazowiecki and his Solidarity-led Cabinet have promised,
however, to respect the country's military obligations to the
Soviet-led alliance.
   Shevardnadze, the highest-level Soviet official to visit Poland
since Mazowiecki's took office in mid-August, held a meeting with
the prime minister Tuesday that lasted an hour longer than planned.
   ``I am very happy about our many-faceted talk,'' Mazowiecki said
after the two-hour meeting. ``I accepted the invitation to Moscow
with gratitude.'' He said the visit would be on Nov. 23.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said after the
meeting that ``There are some problems, but they were discussed in
the spirit of understanding and seeking solutions.''
   He said Shevardnadze pledged the Soviet Union would maintain its
level of deliveries to Poland, which is dependent on Moscow for
oil, gas, electricity and raw materials.
   That was a significant gesture because Poland has been having
trouble delivering products to the Soviet Union due to its
protracted economic crisis. Poland suffers from a shortage of
industrial goods, high inflation and a $39 billion foreign debt.
   The Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu reported Tuesday that
Moscow provides nearly 85 percent of Poland's crude oil, 65 percent
of its processed petroleum products and 72 percent of its iron ore.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union will try to uncover the truth
about the World War II massacre of 4,300 Polish soldiers in the
Katyn Forest near Smolensk in the Soviet Union.
   Moscow has not acknowledged official responsiblity for the
crime, but it generally has been accepted that Soviet soldiers were
to blame.
   The issue long has been a sore point in Polish-Soviet relations.
   Shevardnadze was asked by reporters if he and Mazowiecki had
discussed the issue. ``All questions, everything connected with
history _ present and future _ were raised,'' he replied. ``We are
going to study history and search for documents if they exist.''
   Poland has been pressing for a joint declaration of Soviet
responsibility for the deaths. Hard-line factions in the Soviet
Union so far have been reluctant to do this.

reversed the party's position and said pro-democracy activists will
be invited to join in national talks on possible reforms.
   In another change, state-run media reported that the government
will propose a law next month allowing all citizens to travel to
the West and dropping requirements that family members stay behind
as insurance.
   And party chief Egon Krenz hinted Tuesday he is considering
amnesty for people jailed on charges of trying to flee West.
Western sources estimate thousands are jailed on such charges.
   Krenz, speaking in response to reporters' questions after
meeting with a senior West German official, said pro-democracy
activists could take part in the reform talks.
   ``No one will be excluded from the dialogue,'' he said.
   Krenz did not say whether the nation's growing opposition would
be officially recognized, or whether challenges to the socialist
foundation of East Germany would be tolerated.
   Communist Party officials previously had made it clear that
opposition groups would be excluded from such talks, and staunchly
reaffirmed the country's socialist basis.
   In the first meeting between the new leader and a senior West
German official, Krenz met for two hours with Wolfgang Mischnick,
parliamentary leader of the Free Democratic Party, the junior
partner in Bonn's governing coalition.
   On Tuesday, about 12,000 East Germans defied a warning from
Krenz and protested in the streets of the capital after Parliament
confirmed him as president. Police did not intervene.
   After the ritual confirmation in the traditionally rubber-stamp
chamber _ some deputies voted ``no'' for the first time in the
country's history _ Krenz called for an end to street
demonstrations by advocates of a more open society.
   He also promised to investigate charges of police brutality
during protests earlier this month and Communist authorities
admitted, for the first time, that some police had used excessive
force against peaceful activists.
   Krenz was in charge of East Germany's police at the time.
   The 52-year-old career politician replaced Erich Honecker last
week as party leader, East Germany's supreme leadership post, and
promised ``a new course'' for the country that young skilled
workers have been leaving by the tens of thousands.
   The state-run ADN news agency reported Tuesday that when the
Communist Party's governing Central Committee begins its next
session Nov. 8, it will consider reform proposals including a more
liberal travel law.
   ADN said the party's ruling Politburo would propose a system
under which every citizen could get a passport and be allowed to
travel ``to all nations and West Berlin.''
   It said the Politburo would call for an end to the current
requirements that family members stay behind as insurance that the
travelers will return, and that current demands for ``grounds'' to
travel should be dropped.
   Since Hungary opened its Western border last month, more than
50,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany, which grants them
automatic citizenship. Tens of thousands more have taken to the
streets, saying they are staying to fight for reforms including
free elections and speech.
   ADN said the Politburo expressed the hope that the new travel
law can be put into effect before the end of this year.
   Krenz ran unopposed for the presidency and received 26 `no'
votes in the 500-member Parliament, with another 26 deputies
abstaining.
   His election triggered the East Berlin demonstration, in which
marchers demanding more democratic elections chanted ``Egon, who
asked us?'' and ``We are the competition.''
   The march was shown on East Germany's state-run television and
reported by ADN with no hint of criticism. Witnesses estimated the
number of marchers at 7,000, but ADN reported later that as many as
12,000 took part.
   No violence was reported between protesters and police, who
directed traffic to keep the march route clear.
   More than 300,000 people had marched through the streets of
Leipzig Monday night in the largest demonstration in the country's
40 years.
   An official newspaper, the National Zeitung, charged today that
governmental neglect has sparked the mass demonstrations in Leipzig.
   In his acceptance speech Tuesday, Krenz called for an end to
street protests but also said he would look into the police
brutality charges.
   East German officials later admitted that police had attacked
peaceful demonstrators. ADN said that 83 complaints were under
investigation and that police had apologized in several cases where
the allegations proved true.

   Air filled the tiny lungs of Elizabeth
Patrice Cupples for the first time on Oct. 17 at 5:03 p.m. One
minute later, her new world shook violently.
   ``I thought, `We'll just have to wait until it stops, then they
can sew me up,''' Marilyn Cupples recalled one week after the bumpy
delivery at AMI Community Hospital.
   Drs. Katherine Corby and Marsha Muir had just delivered 7-pound,
14-ounce Elizabeth by Caesarean section when the operating room
began shaking.
   ``The baby had just been born when the earthquake started.
Things started moving around _ the lights started to sway, the
walls were moving and things were bumping along,'' said Corby.
   At that moment, the newborn girl was whisked away to the nursery
while Corby and Muir fought to stay on their feet to protect the
mother and shield her from flying debris with their bodies.
   Mrs. Cupples said: ``The room started shaking and all I heard
them say was, `Let's get her (the baby) out of here.'''
   Mrs. Cupples, 40, was awake during delivery but numbed from the
waist down. Her husband, Jim, was at her side.
   ``There wasn't much I could do really. I knew we'd get through
it,'' said Mrs. Cupples.
   Corby was astonished by the way Mrs. Cupples handled the
disaster. ``While we were sewing her up, she talked about what the
Richter reading would be,'' she said.
   ``He (Cupples) was in a bit of an altered state, though. He was
laughing and telling his new daughter, `You were born and the earth
moved.' They named her Elizabeth but during all this they said they
considered calling her Eartha,'' Corby said.
   There was even more levity in the delivery room.
   ``I said, `Why don't we do a tummy tuck while we're at it?'''
the new mother said.
   Elizabeth Patrice is the first baby for Mrs. Cupples, a
personnel consultant. Her husband is an engineer.
   ``We have been thinking of all sorts of nicknames because of the
earthquake,'' Mrs. Cupples said from her Santa Cruz home Tuesday.
   ``Eartha, Quaker, Tremblor and Epi are the ones we've thought
of. Epi might stick because her initials are E.P. and it also
sounds like epicenter,'' Mrs. Cupples said.
   Mrs. Cupples and her newborn went home from the hospital Friday.
``When I got home, I felt like I had been in a time warp. The first
aftershock at home I started crying. It jolted me into reality,''
she said.
   At 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, one week after the delivery and the
earthquake, Mrs. Cupples was nursing Elizabeth. ``I wondered if
there would be an aftershock. There is still a feeling around here
that history may repeat itself.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) Nineteen people who played roles in the capture
and conviction of Richard Ramirez in the so-called Night Stalker
case will get $36,777 in rewards from Los Angeles County.
   The top reward of $10,388 goes to Jesse N. Perez, who provided
authorities with Ramirez's name and facts about the crimes and
helped recover a murder weapon.
   Other rewards range from $250 to $1,000 for providing
information to various authorities, helping capture Ramirez in East
Los Angeles or directing police to Ramirez on the day of his arrest.
   The money will be awarded at a yet-to-be-scheduled ceremony,
county supervisors said in deciding the awards Tuesday.
   Ramirez was sentenced to death after he was convicted on 12
counts of first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder
and 30 other felonies stemming from a string of nocturnal attacks,
most of them in the summer of 1985.

<HEAD>Communist Party Allows For Possible Multi-Party Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist Party has for
the first time indicated it may allow a multi-party democracy,
according to an official party platform released today.
   The document, adopted at last week's session of the
policy-setting Central Committee and carried by Tanjug news agency,
declared the party will support ``the development of political
pluralism (and) individual rights and freedoms of individuals.''
   It also called for free and democratic elections, for
independence of the judiciary and for ``guaranteeing citizens the
right to form political associations and (independent) trade
unions.''
   The platform, likely to be adopted at the next party congress
scheduled for Jan. 20, appears to be the result of a compromise
between Communist reformers and conservatives.
   The document stopped short of advocating establishment of
opposition parties but stressed the party will support the setting
up of ``citizens' political organizations ... which ensure the free
competition of political ideas and programs.''
   The platform, however, made clear the party did not ``accept the
reduction of political pluralism exclusively to a multi-party
system, as this is only one of the possible forms of political
pluralism.''
   Yugoslavia's liberal northern republic of Slovenia already has
allowed the establishment of several independent political parties
and plans to hold its first free Western-style parliamentary
elections next year.
   But the largest republic, Serbia, strongly opposes multi-party
democracy and is planning to hold its own legislative elections
next month in which only officially sanctioned candidates will be
allowed to run.
   Serbia is supported in its stand by Yugoslavia's military, whose
entire officer corps is almost entirely made up of Communist Party
members.

   A high school teacher suspended for
refusing to wear a tie says he may not accept his job back despite
a judge's order that he be reinstated.
   ``I won't go back until I get something in writing that says,
`You're welcome to walk into the building,''' said Bill Webb
following a ruling Tuesday that his constitutional rights were
violated by a dress code banning denim for teachers and requiring
male teachers to wear ties.
   Kanawha County Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman ordered Webb reinstated
with back pay and court costs.
   Webb, 46, a math teacher at Point Pleasant High for 20 years,
was fired Dec. 21 after being suspended three times for refusing to
follow the dress code.
   A lawyer for the school board says an appeal of Kaufman's ruling
is virtually certain, and Webb says that would take months. So for
now, Webb says he will continue working at his Gallipolis, Ohio,
farm and auto repair shop.
   ``Knowing the people of Mason County the way I do, they'll take
the next eight months to appeal it, and we won't know anything
until June or July,'' he said.
   Diane Johnson, an assistant Mason County prosecutor acting as
the school board's attorney, says she'll ask Kaufman for a stay of
his order until the appeal is settled. She said she doesn't plan to
file for the stay until after the board's Nov. 6 meeting.
   She said, however, that if Webb shows up for work, the board
will file for a stay immediately.
   Johnson also said the dress code, which was revised to delete
the tie requirement, remains in effect.
   Webb contended that his apparel, usually jeans and a cotton work
shirt, caused no problems until Superintendent Charles Chambers
issued the dress code.
   In his ruling, Kaufman said Webb had been praised as an
``excellent teacher'' who had good rapport with his students and
said his dress had caused no problems.
   ``This dress code involves constitutional considerations which
include the right of the individual teacher to dress as he or she
chooses so long as no disruptive or distracting effects occur which
are detrimental to the educational process,'' the judge wrote.

<HEAD>Bette Midler's Attorney Claims Ford Deliberately Copied Singer For
Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Bette Midler told a federal
jury that Ford Motor Co. was wrong to use a sound-alike version of
one of her hits for a car commercial after the entertainer declined
to sing it herself.
   ``They made the commercial anyway,'' said Peter Laird during his
opening statement Tuesday at the civil trial in U.S. District
Court. ``They deliberately imitated Bette Midler's voice.''
   Miss Midler is suing Ford and the Young &amp; Rubicam advertising
agency for $10 million over a 1986 television commercial for
Mercury Sable automobiles.
   The lawsuit contends the use of a sound-alike voice to recreate
a variation of Miss Midler's 1972 hit ``Do Ya Wanna Dance'' was
unfair competition and infringement of the right to publicity.
   Robert M. Callagy, an attorney for Young &amp; Rubicam, admitted
that the commercial imitated Miss Midler but he denied any
wrongdoing under federal copyright laws.
   ``We had the right to imitate the Midler sound recording,''
Callagy said. ``It was consistent with the law.''
   Young &amp; Rubicam hired one of Miss Midler's former backup singers
to perform the song after Miss Midler's manager turned down an
offer for her to do the ad.
   Howard Privett, an attorney for Ford, said the automaker was not
involved in making the commercial and only approved it for airing.
   Miss Midler, whose recent films include ``Beaches'' and
``Outrageous Fortune,''was not in court Tuesday but was expected to
testify later.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Oct. 23
   San Francisco Examiner on the California earthquake:
   Residents of the San Francisco Bay area are starting to pick up
the pieces ... after the massive earthquake that killed scores of
people, injured and left homeless thousands more, and caused
billions of dollars in damages.
   Despite the toll, some 75,000 football fans saw the San
Francisco 49ers play in Stanford University stadium on Sunday,
defeating the New England Patriots, and it was announced that the
World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics
would resume ... Friday.
   Such events perhaps are part of the answer to a question which
must be asked: Why will millions of people continue to live in a
known fault zone that promises even larger earthquakes with greater
death and destruction?
   One obvious reason is that all of us place our lives and
fortunes on the line every day. More than 50,000 persons die each
year in auto accidents alone.
   Another part of the answer lies with the unquenchable part of
the human spirit that has always defied threats to life and
economic stability.
   But together, are these reasons the full answer to the question
of why virtually all of those in the San Francisco area are now
beginning to rebuild their lives and stake out new futures? No,
they are not.
   A certain state of mind exists in California in general and San
Francisco in particular. A youthful exhilaration exists there that
comes from the outdoor lifestyle of swimming, surfing and skiing
and being on the cutting edge of much change in American society.
   For millions, the risk of life in that region is worth it.

   Aberdeen (S.D.) American News on the earthquake and compassion:
   Last Wednesday (Oct. 18), the switchboard at KYW-TV in
Philadelphia logged nearly 500 angry calls between 8:30 a.m. and
noon.
   They came in response to NBC's coverage of the California
earthquake that expanded the ``Today'' show and cut the regular
morning lineup.
   The quake put the Bay Bridge World Series on hold. The next
morning sportscasters, with a token nod to the tragedy of death and
devastated lives in California, clamored to know when the series
would resume.
   Incredible. That within hours attention could so easily turn
from real-life battles for survival to the contrived struggle of a
game.
   Disquieting that viewers would respond so angrily at being
denied an hour of watching actors mimic tragedy.
   Distressing that even a few Americans were unwilling to pause _
and to make the adjustments in their daily lives that comprise
compassion.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on the earthquake and baseball:
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent deserves special praise for
his actions since the Oct. 17 earthquake. His decision to delay the
World Series reveals a solid set of priorities.
   Candlestick Park probably could have withstood an early
resumption of the series. Bay area residents certainly could use a
diversion from the task of cleaning up.
   But resuming play wasn't worth the extra burden the game would
place on the area's already overtaxed highway and public safety
systems. Having the games on weekday afternoons to meet the East
Coast's prime-time schedule would push more traffic onto San
Francisco's weakened transportation system at rush hour.
   Given how much overemphasis is placed on sports in America,
Vincent's willingness to postpone the Series is heartening.
Baseball, after all, is what you're supposed to do after the real
work is done.

   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on flag burning:
   It's probably a good thing the U.S. Senate killed a proposed
constitutional amendment against burning or otherwise desecrating
the American flag. The Bill of Rights has stood us in good stead
for two centuries now, and it isn't wise to tinker with it.
   The issue was understandably emotion-charged. The senators
understood very well that their constituents love the flag and want
it protected. Probably some of them voted for the amendment though
they privately deemed it unwise, and were sure it would be
defeated, in order to appear to be on the side of the angels.
   But a number of influential voices, including those of several
leading conservatives, had been raised against the amendment. The
gist of what they had to say was that flag burning does not pose
any such threat to the public order as to justify altering out
basic guarantees of liberty and due process.

   The Sheboygan (Wis.) Press on flag burning:
   A little flag-waving is in order for the U.S. Senate's defeat of
a proposed constitutional amendment to ban burning or desecrating
Old Glory.
   The boiling cauldron of emotions over flag burning this past
summer has been reduced to a low simmer, and the Senate has finally
put the issue to rest, as it should have.
   Meddling with the U.S. Constitution is unnecessary. Besides, a
flag-burning amendment would have weakened the very freedoms that
the flag represents.
   Hurray for the Senate, and for the red, white and blue.

   The Senate's rejection of a constitutional amendment that would

another round in the acrimonious battle over protection for the
national colors. ...
   Before the Supreme Court overturned the Texas statute, 48 states

   Delaware County Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on Oliver North's
pension:
   Ollie North's corps of heavyweight pals continue to toil on
behalf of the convicted felon.
   Their latest effort involves the $23,000-a-year pension North
earned for 20 years of military service.
   The Navy stripped North of the pension after he was convicted
and sentenced to probation in July for his role in the Reagan
administration's secret scheme to arm the Contras.
   Now some lawmakers are vowing to get the ex-Marine his pension.
They justify their action by saying Congress never intended that
its anti-shredding law deprive North of his pension.
   The Senate is scheduled to vote Nov. 3 on a bill to exempt North
from the penalty imposed after his conviction on three felonies. ...
   Sen. Orrin Hatch already has the solution: Give North special
treatment.
   Said the Utah Republican, ``Regardless of what happened in the
Iran-Contra affair, people have a difficult time understanding why
he is being denied the pension that he earned.''
   Sure he earned it, by giving 20 years of military service to his
country. But then he decided to shred some documents and in doing
so gave up any right he has to that money.
   Sorry, Ollie, you don't deserve the pension.

   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on students and cultural ignorance:
   American college students ... have a high degree of cultural
ignorance. The cry already has gone up for American colleges to do
something about that. ...
   A majority of the (college seniors responding to a recent Gallup
Poll commisssioned by the National Endowment for the Humanities)
were unable to say who was president at the time of the Korean War.
Only 58 percent knew that the Civil War was fought sometime between
1850 and 1900.
   Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, used the poll results to call for a mandatory 50-hour
college curriculum which would cover five areas of knowledge. ...
   But a good part of the pressure is being put on the wrong
institutions. Students arrive in college having had 12 or more
years of formal schooling. What the test results show is that they
are being cheated in their elementary and high schools, not that
the colleges have failed.

   The Joplin (Mo.) Globe on foreign investment:
   Congress has set its cap to stifle foreign investment, which if
happens would be a gross miscarriage of lawmaking.
   The legislative move doubtless has been spurred by a surge of
foreign investment in the United States in recent years, causing
people to worry about American dependence on other countries.
   Such concerns are unwarranted for a couple reasons.
   One, foreign investment is not nearly as extensive as popularly
thought.
   Two, foreign investment brings to the U.S. economy significant
advantages.
   Frankly, Americans don't or can't (because of taxes) save enough
to cover the government's massive deficits. So the United States
needs investments from abroad to continue economic growth and
sustained vitality.

   The Dallas Morning News on the CIA:
   Should the Central Intelligence Agency be given the authority to
become involved in coups that result in the assassination of
foreign leaders? ...
   The Bush administration seems bent on rescinding a 1976 order
issued by President Gerald Ford barring U.S. involvement in
assassinations. ... Bush is entering a mine field. ...
   Weakening the Ford directive would be a virtual invitation to
the CIA to strike out on adventures that may ultimately be
counter-productive. The temptation to assist in the elimination of
despised foreign leaders would be great, but does the executive
branch really want to get into the business of playing God? ...
   It may be reasonably asked if CIA involvement in foreign
assassinations might not result in foreign agents showing less
restraint against U.S. political figures here. ...
   The United States should promote democracy by promoting
democracy. That means giving encouragement to the opponents of
dictatorships, teaching them about the principles of our system of
government and helping promote the conditions under which democracy
thrives. ...
   But under no circumstances short of outright war are the
interests of democracy promoted by dialing CIA for murder.

   The Seattle Times on East Germany:
   In a season of extraordinary events in Eastern Europe, the
removal of Erich Honecker from power in East Germany must rank
among the most dazzling and perplexing.
   The man whose communist principles were steeled by a decade in a
Nazi prison, the man who supervised construction of the Berlin
Wall, is the same leader who had the wit 18 years ago to renew
political and financial ties with West Germany.
   Honecker, 77, was deposed in favor of his younger protege, Egon
Krenz, 52, who is credited with the same dogged commitment to
hard-line ideology.
   A startling conclusion that may be slow to form in the West is
that Honecker was removed not for his failure to crush a nascent
pro-democracy movement, but for dragging his feet on economic
reforms. ...
   Honecker, who outlasted the Nazis, could not keep pace with his
country's desire for political and economic reform.
   If Krenz is no more responsive, he may not last, either.

   The State, Columbia, S.C., on East Germany and Hungary:
   (Egon) Krenz has made it clear that the Communist Party (in East
Germany) will maintain its leading role and will not share power
with any other political element. In truth, there's no organization
to share it with right now.
   East Germany has not allowed an independent movement like
Poland's Solidarity to emerge, and there is no reform element
within the party as there is in Hungary. But the pressures building
up in the country will create outlets, and ... Krenz had better
have the flexibility to deal with (them).
   While the leaders were changing in East Berlin, the party was
changing in Budapest. Hungary's Communist Party took the
unprecedented step of declaring itself politically bankrupt and
recasting itself as the Socialist Party. Then Parliament abandoned
one-party rule by allowing parties to freely form and compete in
elections scheduled for next year.
   The Communist label proved to be poison when Poland allowed free
elections earlier this year. Just how complete this reformation is
is not yet apparent. The new party elected the former Communist
Party chairman as its president, but the reformers seem to have the
upper hand. ...
   As we watch these events, we should remember that Moscow will
probably tolerate more deviation in Hungary and Poland than in East
Germany, which it considers the centerpiece of its empire. East
German dissenters might do well to keep that in mind, too.

   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on coca growing:
   Years before crack became the scourge of America, Bolivian
peasants grew coca plants. Some of the leaves were sent aboard to
be processed into illegal cocaine, but mounds of them wound up in
the marketplaces of La Paz.
   The highlands Indians were in the habit of chewing the leaves to
help numb their hunger and the piercing cold.
   The presidents of Bolivia, Peru and Colombia surely must
understand that many Indians view coca as a medicinal plant that
helps them survive their harsh environment. Now, with demand for
cocaine and crack soaring in the United States and Europe, the
peasants have come to see it as an export crop that helps ease
their pain with money.
   The peasants, who find themselves whipsawed between drug
outlaws, guerrillas and the government, need a substitute for their
coca cultivation.
   The presidents of the three drug-troubled Andean countries
decided at their meeting to invite President Bush to meet with them
within 90 days. We hope he goes with some concrete ideas for wooing
the coca-growing peasants away from the drug traffickers and
left-wing guerrillas.
   The possibilities include targeting U.S. agricultural assistance
to the remote regions where coca is now grown. The peasants need
help in modernizing their herding and growing practices. The United
States could provide farm equipment and loans for growing legal
crops.
   Easing trade barriers into the United States for legal
agricultural exports from the coca-growing areas may also help.

   Lebanon's Christian leader, Gen. Michel
Aoun, has invited Christian and Moslem lawmakers to a meeting to
discuss their plan for ending the country's 14-year-old civil war,
a newspaper said today.
   Aoun has criticized the plan for not setting a deadline for the
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon but was quoted as telling
Paris' Le Figaro newspaper that he has not completely rejected it.
   Sources said Lebanese Christian legislators, who agreed to the
accord in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, feared Aoun would have them
arrested if they returned to Beirut. Aoun said he would guarantee
their safety.
   ``I have not said a categoric `no' to the accord,'' Le Figaro
quoted Aoun as saying from his compound at Baabda, near Beirut.
   ``On the contrary, I accept all the institutional reforms.
Whether they are good or bad, I won't interfere. It's an affair
between Lebanese,'' Aoun said.
   The 63 Lebanese legislators, evenly divided among Moslems and
Maronite Christians, met in Taif, Saudi Arabia for three weeks to
come up with a plan to end the war.
   The changes they approved Sunday would shift political control
from the Christian minority to the Moslem majority. On Monday, the
committee issued a document calling on Parliament to meet no later
than Nov. 7 in Lebanon to ratify the reforms and elect a president.
   Aoun invited the legislators, even those he considers traitors,
to a meeting.
   ``The text of Taif hasn't been ratified yet. If they are
convincing, maybe I would be in agreement with them,'' Aoun was
quoted as saying. He also said he would accept a new president
``even if they decide the president should no longer be a
Maronite.''
   Aoun, who declared a ``war of liberation'' in March to drive the
40,000 Syrian troops from the country, found fault with the accord
for not setting a date for a Syrian withdrawal.
   ``It's a vague redeployment, then, two years after the
installation of new institutions, a retreat. How much time is all
this going to take?,'' Le Figaro quoted him as saying.
   Aoun also said he would not run for the presidency, Le Figaro
reported.
   In Paris, popular Maronite Parliament deputy Raymond Edde became
the first politician to announce publicly he would be a candidate.
   Edde, who has been living in self-imposed exile in France
following attempts to assassinate him in Lebanon, said he would
remain in Paris and not travel to Beirut for the election.
   Also today, rival Shiite Moslem militias clashed in a brief
firefight in Syrian-policed south Beirut. Police said one person
was killed and two were wounded.
   The clash pitted gunmen of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, against fighters of the mainstream Shiite Amal
militia.
   A police spokesman said the 30-minute clash with automatic
rifles broke out over ``traffic priority'' between a member of
Hezbollah and an Amal militiaman in a narrow alley of south Beirut.

   A mob witness whose protective custody
is under investigation ``played court'' with his family in a
judge's chambers while they lived in an apartment in a police
station, his wife says.
   Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. on Tuesday announced an internal
investigation of the Police Department over the custody of Peter
Gilbert, a three-time murderer who was a key witness in two trials
of alleged organized crime figures.
   It will be at least the third investigation of the confessed
murderer, who died of a heart attack in June 1988 while on his way
to an unsupervised skydiving trip in Connecticut. He had been
expected to testify against other alleged organized crime figures.
   Packages containing 9 grams of cocaine were found in Gilbert's
parachute bag. Later investigations showed that while in police
custody, Gilbert was paid at least $98,000, took other trips,
charged meals and liquor to the state and bought bullets and
jewelry at taxpayers' expense.
   Paolino, who said he didn't know Gilbert was in department
custody, ordered the probe because of the ``outrageous
revelations'' of recent weeks, including reports that a police
officer was videotaped joking with Gilbert about the free ride they
were getting.
   In the 30 months Gilbert, 43, was in police custody, he was kept
at a police station apartment with his wife, Debra, and some of his
seven children, then transferred in January 1988 to a safe house
while he served a 10-year sentence for murder.
   Mrs. Gilbert told WPRI-TV in an interview broadcast Tuesday that
while the family lived in the apartment at the police station ``the
policeman would stand in the hall and Peter and I would go skating,
and our daughter had a little three-wheeler and would be skating
all over. ...
   ``We went into the (municipal) judge's chambers and played
court, and we had fun,'' she said.
   The apartment formerly had been a matron's living quarters.
   The Providence Journal-Bulletin reported Saturday that Mrs.
Gilbert had a videotape of a police officer joking with her
husband. Mrs. Gilbert told the newspaper the tape shows Detective
Steven Cross with his arm around her husband's shoulders saying,
``The criminal justice system has been good to us, Peter, huh?''
   Cross, who was recently transferred from the detective division
to the auto squad, which investigates stolen cars, was not in the
office for comment Tuesday, said Police Officer Bob Lauro. Cross
told WPRI-TV that his comment was ``play acting'' to make Gilbert
feel at home.
   WPRI-TV broadcast footage Tuesday that it said was taken as
Gilbert cavorted with his police keepers at a Florida motel pool.
The station said it obtained the footage from Mrs. Gilbert.
   The film showed the incident with Cross and pictures the station
said Gilbert took of a new van, one of several vehicles he
apparently bought with a $20,000 credit union loan obtained while
under police protection.
   Gilbert also videotaped a police officer sleeping in a poolside
lounge chair while he was supposed to be guarding the witness.
``Hard time, tough duty,'' Gilbert said on the tape as he laughed.
   The sleeping officer has since committed suicide, WPRI said.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete announced a state police investigation of
the Gilbert case last week at the recommendation of the U.S.
attorney.

<TEXT>
   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu has
condemned reforms by some of his Soviet bloc neighbors, telling a
Communist Party plenum in Bucharest that they represent an
abandonment of socialism.
   Ceausescu, who has ruled for 24 years, also accused unnamed
``imperialist circles'' of trying to destroy world communism, the
official Agerpres news agency reported today.
   The two-day plenum debating ideological questions began one day
earlier than scheduled. Observers speculated that the early opening
may have been prompted by unease over Monday's mass commemoration
in Hungary of its 1956 anti-communist uprising.
   More than 100,000 people gathered for the officially condoned
rallies in Budapest, which were broadcast nationally by Hungarian
television and could be watched by many of Romania's
1.7-million-member Hungarian minority.
   Ceausescu rules over an old-style communist state clinging to
tough economic policies that have produced the Soviet bloc's worst
food and energy shortages. He criticized Hungary and Poland by name
in a speech last week for their market-oriented economic reforms.
   Poland has the East bloc's first non-communist government and
Hungary this week declared itself a democracy. Hungary's Communist
Party even changed its name.
   The Romanian party plenum, also called to discuss better food
supplies for its hard-pressed people, is the last such meeting
prior to a party congress scheduled for Nov. 20-25. The congress
formally is the highest decision-making body of the Communist Party.
   ``Steps are taken in some (Soviet bloc) countries that weaken
the positions of socialism and open the way to the reinstatement of
capitalism in various forms,'' Agerpres, monitored in Vienna,
quoted Ceausescu as telling the plenum Tuesday.
   ``Some openly declare that they want to take various capitalist
countries for a model,'' Ceausescu said. ``It is hard to
understand, though, that socialism can be developed and improved by
taking as a model the capitalist system divided into classes of
oppressors and oppressed.''
   Although he named no countries, Ceausescu clearly targeted
Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union, as he spoke of economic
reforms that would ``open the path to the lowering of the people's
living standard.''
   ``Facts in some socialist countries that switch to the `market
economy,' (such as) mounting inflation and profiteering ... spell
danger to the very development of the socialist society,''
Ceausescu said.
   In his address, Ceausescu made clear that Romania will stick to
the centralized economy that has brought it widespread food
shortages and have left many Romanian houses cold and streets dark
in the past four winters.
   He warned that ``the imperialist circles' actions against
communism ... are a great danger for detente and cooperation.
   ``If they continue they will inevitably lead to an even more
drastic deterioration of the world situation,'' Ceausescu said
without elaboration.
   Romanian exiles abroad listening to his speech broadcast by
Radio Bucharest noted that Ceausescu stuttered and raised his voice
several times throughout the two-hour, frequently emotional, speech.

   The Philippines may become another
Colombia if anti-narcotics agencies cannot stop the increasingly
powerful drug rings operating in this country, a senator said today.
   ``Precisely, if we do not do something about this, there might
come a time when we will see the spectacle of the Philippines
becoming like Colombia, where drug lords even have armies,
helicopters, planes and even tanks,'' said Sen. Alberto Romulo.
   Romulo made the statement during a public hearing on last week's
report given by Sen. Ernesto Herrera alleging that at least 17
military officials are protecting drug syndicates.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
admitted during the hearing that there are military men involved in
drug rings, but he said officials are doing their best to weed them
out.
   At least 40 officers have been ousted since Herrera's report and
assigned to combat units fighting communist guerrillas in the
countryside, Montano added.
   He said the drug problem has grown swiftly in the last few
years. Most drug syndicates operating in Asia's so-called ``Golden
Triangle'' of Burma, Laos and Thailand use the Philippines as a
relay point to Australia, the United States, Italy, Iran and some
Asian countries, he said.
   A total of 2,543 people were arrested for various drug-related
offenses last year, and 1,884 were arrested from January to
September this year, Montano said.
   But Sen. Romulo said most of those arrested and convicted were
small-time pushers, and none of the three major local drug groups'
leaders or their top managers has been arrested.
   Col. Virgilio David, chief of the Constabulary's Narcotics
Command, said he plans to change men under his command as often as
possible to prevent them from fraternizing with drug ring members.
   ``The temptation is just too great for soldiers whose average
salary is about 80 pesos ($3.60) a day,'' David said.
   During the hearing, Herrera played the first of at least 15
tapes of interviews with drug pushers, military and police officers
who gave names of officers involved in corruption involving the
drug trade.

   A husband hurled a kerosene lamp
during a fight with his wife early today, triggering a massive
seven-hour fire that left 31,000 people homeless and one person
dead in a Manila slum, officials said.
   Investigators said initial reports indicated the fire started in
the house of Jose Gallen, the lone fatality. They said his
unidentified wife was hurt when Gallen threw the kerosene lamp
during an argument.
   Residents said the fire in suburban Pasay city spread rapidly
because of the fire department's slow response and poor equipment.
One resident said a fire truck arrived but it had no water.
   Another firetruck stalled and blocked a street, and had to be
pushed away by the residents, witnesses said.
   Fire investigator Renato Recto said they responded immediately
as soon as the fire station received the alarm at 2:30 a.m., but
vehicles parked on the narrow streets in the community prevented
firetrucks from moving closer to the blaze.
   The fire was put out seven hours later.
   The Department of Social Work and Development said the houses of
more than 6,000 families were destroyed or damaged, with a total of
31,000 people without shelter. Victims are being sheltered in a
school house and an unoccupied private compound, officials said.

   NATO defense ministers today welcomed
Soviet promises to cut its powerful military forces but urged the
Kremlin to do more to slash its tactical nuclear weapons.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other ministers of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization also applauded in their final
statement Moscow's pledge to remove a disputed radar station in
Siberia.
   Cheney cautioned that the Soviet Union remains a powerful
military force and said ``there is great uncertainty about how
events will unfold in the Soviet Union.''
   Wrapping up two days of nuclear strategy talks on the southern
Portuguese coast, the officials said they ``looked forward to the
prompt and full implementation of this commitment.''
   After the meeting, Cheney was to fly to London for talks with
British officials on the European leg of a three-week foreign tour.
   In the final statement, the ministers said they ``were
encouraged by the changes underway in the Soviet Union and some of
its allies.''
   ``Nevertheless, we recognized the continuing capability of the
forces of the Warsaw Pact for offensive military action,'' it said.
   It expressed concern about ``substantial capabilities'' in
Moscow's space program and its nuclear modernization program.
   ``We welcomed the announced Warsaw Pact unilateral force
reductions and looked forward to their full implementation,'' the
statement said.
   However, the ministers said the cuts ``would have little effect
on the Warsaw Pact's nuclear capability and, in particular, on
their continuing massive superiority in short-range nuclear missile
systems.''
   ``We therefore called again on the Soviet Union to reduce
unilaterally its short-range missile systems to current NATO
levels,'' the statement said.
   The ministers' agenda was somewhat overshadowed by Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's unusually candid speech on
Monday.
   He told the Soviet legislature that the Krasnoyarsk radar
station violated the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
and said it would be removed. The facility stood in the way of
further arms treaties, he said.
   ``It was an acknowledgement of what the United States has
maintained for a long time,'' said a senior U.S. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``We obviously applaud this recognition'' and the pledge to
dismantle the installation, he said.
   West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called
Shevardnadze's speech ``remarkable'' and ``a true sign of glasnost
(openness).''
   ``The fact that he stands up and says straight out that
Krasnoyarsk was a violation of the (ABM treaty) is a whole new
language,'' he told reporters.
   Shevardnadze said the decision to take down the giant,
phased-array radar had been criticized internally. But, he said,
``We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the
conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons.''
   The United States has argued the ABM treaty prohibited the
deployment of large radar stations, capable of giving early
warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery of
U.S. or Soviet territory. The Krasnoyarsk radar is deep within
Soviet Siberia.
   In his speech, Shevardnadze also called for dissolving NATO and
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Not surprisingly, the NATO officials did not share his vision of
an end to the Western allliance.
   ``I can assure you, we're not thinking of disbanding NATO,''
Stoltenberg said.
   All 16 NATO nations, except France, attended the meeting. France
does not belong to the alliance's integrated military structure.
Iceland, which has no armed forces, has observer status.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is trimming tank production
by half for the next five years, building only 850 tanks annually,
according to a report published today.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov made the promise during
meetings earlier this month with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
according to unidentified defense officials cited by The Washington
Post.
   In Vilamoura, Portugal, today, Cheney said Soviet officials have
``indicated it is their intention to produce fewer tanks than they
have in the past.''
   ``We have seen some beginning signs that in fact that transition
may be occurring,'' he said at a news conference on the final day
of a NATO nuclear strategy session.
   Even so, he said, ``As of today, their tank production still far
exceeds that of the West, all NATO nations combined, although it
does appear to be lower than it has been in the recent past.''
   Pressed about a promised reduction to 850 tanks a year, Cheney
replied, ``I wouldn't want to be more precise than I have been.''
   The Defense Intelligence Agency has estimated annual Soviet tank
production at 3,500 in a total Warsaw Pact output of 4,200, but
Soviet Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev told the House Armed Services
Committee in July the figure was about 1,700.
   The newspaper said DIA recently reported a reduction in Soviet
tank production.
   If Yazov's pledge of an additional 50 percent reduction is
realized, Soviet tank production would be about 850 per year. U.S.
production is about 775 in a total North Atlantic Treaty
Organization output of 925 a year, the newspaper said.
   An unidentified senior defense official told the Post that the
production cut may be a result of the Soviets reconsidering what
kinds of weapons are effective.
   ``While tank production is decreasing, production of artillery
and armored personnel carriers is increasing,'' the official said.

   The fatal explosions that ripped through
a plastics plant also may send shock waves through the industry,
driving up plastics prices worldwide, analysts said.
   Analysts said if the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant is destroyed
or shut down for a while, manufacturers of plastic products like
milk jugs and grocery bags could be scrambling for plastic at
higher prices.
   ``If the whole thing goes down, there are going to be shortages
all over the place,'' said analyst Bill Kuhlke of DeWitt &amp; Co., a
Houston-based chemical consulting company.
   The blasts at the plant killed as many as 23 workers and injured
124. Two bodies have been recovered and up to 21 others are missing
and presumed dead.
   Phillips, which supplies up to 19 percent of a common plastic
base, has been leading several companies building factories along
Texas' Gulf Coast. Company officials said Phillips supplies about a
third of the world's plastics and its polyethylene plant No. 5
represented a large chunk of their production power.
   Phillips spokesman Dave Dryden of the company's Bartlesville,
Okla., headquarters said the effects of losing the plant were
unclear.
   ``We're very early in the assessment,'' Dryden said.
   Phillips bought the 800-acre Pasadena plant in 1948, and turned
it into a huge complex employing more than 900 people. It produces
more than 2 billion pounds of plastics per year, three-quarters of
it polyethylene.
   ``The damage we know of was primarily to the polyethylene
plant,'' Dryden said. The plant was scheduled to increase
production 15 percent in 1990.
   He said Phillips has another plant at the complex that makes 500
million pounds of polypropylene annually, which is used carpet
fibers and films. And another part produces K-Resin for plastic
water bottles and rigid, but flexible plastic cups like the ones
used on airlines. That production was to increase production by 50
percent in 1990.
   Consultant Earl Simpson with Bonner &amp; Moore Associates said he
had brushed off talk of a polyethylene price increase the industry
hoped to see Nov. 1, but the Phillips explosion may allow a rise of
about 3 cents per pound. Product in storage will only last about
five weeks, he said.

   A jury convicted a man of criminally
negligent homicide after his dying friend implicated him with the
blink of an eye.
   Frederick Sannicandro, dying in a hospital from a gunshot wound
and unable to speak because of a breathing tube in his throat,
blinked once for ``yes'' when police asked him whether his friend,
Frank Zollbrecht, had shot him.
   Asked if it was an accident, Sannicandro blinked twice for
``no,'' police officers testified.
   A Westchester jury Tuesday found Zollbrecht guilty in the June
1988 shooting during drunken horseplay at the bakery where
Zollbrecht worked.
   Police interviewed Sannicandro, 38, as he was taken into surgery
for a gunshot wound to the abdomen, according to testimony at the
two-week trial. He died shortly after the operation.
   Defense attorney Anthony Morasco called Sannicandro's testimony
unreliable, but police and the attending physician said they
believed he understood the questions.
   Zollbrecht, 45, of Yonkers, faces up to four years in prison
when he is sentenced Nov. 28.

   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila
confirmed today that Khmer Rouge guerrillas have seized a key
Cambodian town near the Thai border and captured tanks and
artillery.
   But Siddhi, the first top official to confirm that the western
town of Pailin was in guerrilla hands, said neither the Cambodian
government nor guerrilla forces are strong enough to win a clear
victory.
   ``In the end they will have to compromise and come back to
negotiations,'' he told a weekly news briefing.
   The guerrillas said the victory Sunday opened the door for an
assault 40 miles to the northeast on Battambang, Cambodia's
second-largest city after the nation's capital, Pnom Penh.
   Khmer Rouge Army radio on Tuesday called on officials and
soldiers of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government to quit.
   ``Parents and compatriots ... please call on your children and
husbands to quickly desert for home ... in order to stay alive,''
said the broadcast, a text of which was seen in Bangkok today.
   Army officers had vowed to hold onto Pailin's gem-rich area
seized by the Khmer Rouge, who have been fighting to topple the
government for the past 11 years.
   Thailand is leading efforts to restart the peace process,
stalled since the failure of an international conference in Paris
in August.
   The main stumbling block was the Cambodian government's refusal
to agree to a government role for the Khmer Rouge, which massacred
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during four years of rule
before Vietnam invaded in 1978 and ousted it from power. The Khmer
Rouge tried to turn Cambodia into an agrarian commune.
   Asked if the Khmer Rouge controlled Pailin, the minister said,
``Yes it is true.'' He added that according to Thai military
reports, the guerrillas captured nine artillery pieces, four tanks,
six trucks and large quantities of ammunition in their assault on
the town.
   Thai military sources said Cambodian government forces had
pulled back to Route 10 linking Pailin with Battambang, the
provincial capital, but the Khmer Rouge continued its attacks and
was trying to seize more territory.
   The Khmer Rouge killed 120 government soldiers and captured 17
in their final assualt on Pailin, the sources said.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of the
guerrilla coalition that also includes the non-Communist Khmer
People's National Liberation Front and the army of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
   The two non-Communist groups also have scored significant
victories in western Cambodia north of Pailin since late September,
when Vietnam said it pulled out the last of its troops.
   Siddhi said today it was uncertain the two factions could hold
on to their gains.
   On Tuesday, heavy fighting was reported along Route 69 as the
guerrillas of the liberation front advanced towards Svey Chek,
which they described as the only barrier between them and the
strategic town of Sisophon.
   Dien Del, deputy commander of the front, claimed Tuesday his
group seized eight small government outposts and cut Route 69 south
and north of Svey Chek.

<HEAD>20 Police and Soldiers Arrested For Atrocities</HEAD>

   At least 20 policemen and soldiers
were arrested on charges of rape, attempted extortion and other
crimes during the struggle with Sinhalese extremists, officials
said today.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said several military officers
were among those arrested in the past month. Lt. Gen. Hamilton
Wanasinghe, the army commander, said if the arrested are found
guilty ``they will be dealt with most severely.''
   Wijeratne said among those arrested were five policemen in a
Colombo suburb on charges of raping a young Sinhalese woman they
detained for questioning after claiming she belonged to the
People's Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese group.
   Police arrested four army lieutenants who allegedly posed as
front members and tried to extort money from a wealthy businessman
in the town of Wellawatte just south of Colombo, said Wijeratne,
who is also deputy defense minister.
   The officials commented after The Sun, an independent newspaper,
voiced concern about an increase in the number of serious crimes
blamed on police.
   At least 5,000 people have been killed in the Sinhalese
heartland of central and southern Sri Lanka since July 1987, when
the government signed an Indian-brokered accord designed to end an
insurgency by Tamil militants in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   The government has blamed most of the deaths on the front, which
has assassinated fellow Sinhalese who serve or back the government.
However, human rights activists, opposition politicians and
religious leaders say government forces and pro-government
vigilante groups are responsible for many killings.
   The People's Liberation Front accuses the government of selling
out the rights of the mainly Buddhist Sinhalese majority by making
too many concessions to the Tamil minority. Tamils, who are mostly
Hindus, account for 18 percent and say they are discriminated
against.
   Tamil guerrillas launched a series of massacres of Sinhalese
civilians. Those attacks, plus the ensuing war pitting the
guerrillas against Sri Lankan soldiers and later Indian
peacekeepers, have claimed 11,000 lives since the Tamil separatist
insurrection began in 1983.

   Witnesses called by attorneys for a white police
officer charged with manslaughter in the shooting of a black
motorcyclist testified today about past racial disturbances in the
city.
   However, Circuit Judge Joseph Farina restricted evidence about
plans for quelling any violence that might stem from the officer's
trial.
   The judge and attorneys for both sides agreed Tuesday that riots
were likely if Officer William Lozano were acquitted.
   Lozano's attorney, Roy Black, who wants the trial moved from
Dade County, did succeed today in admitting a Metro-Dade police
contingency plan into evidence, although Farina ordered it sealed
for now.
   Also introduced was a poster from the ``Overtown Comrades'' that
the defense described as an inflammatory and offered as proof of
efforts to whip up anger over the trial in the black community.
   Lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter in the deaths
of motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, and passenger Allan Blanchard,
24.
   Their deaths touched off three days of racial disturbances in
January.
   Farina, who will rule on Black's motion for change of venue
after hearing more testimony and arguments today, said Tuesday he
didn't need to hear lengthy testimony about the possibility of
violence.
   ``There very well may be post-trial difficulties,'' said Farina.
``But we don't need individuals testifying to that.''
   One person was killed, 11 others were wounded by gunfire and 13
buildings were burned in the rioting after Lloyd was shot while
being chased by police. Blanchard was fatally injured when the
motorcycle crashed.
   The defense attorney had subpoenaed scores of witnesses and
wanted to enter newspaper clippings, videotapes and other documents
into evidence to show that public agencies were preparing for more
violence.
   ``Jurors are going to think if they find my client guilty, there
is not going to be a riot, but if they find not guilty, there is
going to be a riot,'' Black said. ``It's unfair for ordinary people
to have that much responsibility on their shoulders.''
   But Farina threw out most of the subpoenas and limited the riot
testimony during the change of venue hearing to police reports from
four previous racial disturbances in the 1980s, all of which
resulted after a jury found a policeman was innocent of shooting a
black man.
   The judge and attorneys decided Monday to seat a large jury pool
just before the change of venue motions so the panel could be
ordered to avoid reading or listening to testimony on the motions.
   Prosecutors sought to quash Black's subpoenas, but did not
dispute the threat of violence in case of acquittal.
   ``There is a degree of probability that a riot will occur,''
said Roy Wood, an assistant Dade County attorney.
   Police have acknowledged contingency plans for a post-trial
riot, including the purchase of 700 gas masks, arrangements for use
of two armored vehicles and the possible use of the Orange Bowl to
house those arrested during any disturbances.
   Farina said careful questioning of potential jurors should
determine whether their deliberations will be affected by the
chance of possible riots.
   ``I have no doubts that there are a number of individuals in
this community who will accept that responsibilty, as difficult as
it may be,'' he said.

<HEAD>Possible Mercy Killing Probed at New Haven Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of a hospital patient is being
investigated as a possible mercy killing, and two doctors have been
barred from practicing at the hospital until the review is
completed, officials said today.
   Dr. Viswa Nathan, a heart surgeon, was suspended Oct. 4 after
the death the same day of Clarence A. Reid, 66, of New Haven, said
officials at the Hospital of St. Raphael. A second doctor, a
resident at the hospital, was placed on a leave of absence, the
hospital said. The second doctor was not identified.
   Hospital spokesman Ken Warren said today an investigation was
begun because of the ``circumstances surrounding the death,'' but
he would not elaborate. He said Reid's family was notified of the
investigation on the day of his death.
   Nathan did not want to comment on the allegations, a secretary
at his New Haven office said today. She said he was referring all
calls to St. Raphael's.
   Reid's wife, Innebell, was quoted by the New Haven Register on
Wednesday as saying she never asked Nathan to put her husband out
of his suffering.
   She said she took her husband to the hospital after he suffered
what she thought was a stroke. Doctors found a blood clot and
decided to operate, but Reid never regained consciousness after the
surgery, she said.
   ``I never would have asked the doctor to let my husband die. My
husband was a beautiful man,'' she told the Register.
   Reid's death certificate says his thoracic aorta, a major blood
vessel, burst.
   Warren would not comment on whether the hospital believed the
doctors may have acted on their own or heeded a request from the
family.
   Euthanasia is illegal in all 50 states, though the practice is
considered common. In most cases, a doctor either withholds or
withdraws a supportive treatment that might prolong life in a
terminal illness.
   An investigation by St. Raphael's medical board into the
possibility of a mercy killing could take from a week to two
months, said hospital president Daniel Rissing.
   The hospital said it notified both the state medical examiner's
office and the state Department of Health Services Medical Quality
Assurance Division.
   No doctor has ever been convicted of a mercy killing in
Connecticut.

<HEAD>Minister Supports Charge That Abernathy Lied About King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minister has backed up claims that the Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy lied when he wrote that the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. had two encounters with women the night before he
was killed.
   Abernathy's autobiography, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,''
suggests that King had extramarital affairs and contends he was
with two women and physically fought with a third the night before
his April 4, 1968, assassination in Memphis, Tenn. The book has
been widely criticized by others in the civil rights movement.
   At a news conference in Washington Tuesday, the Rev. Bernard Lee
said Abernathy had passed out drunk on the night in question.
   Lee's statement supports a charge made earlier by Adjua Abi
Naantaanbuu, a Memphis woman who said she was with King and
Abernathy the night before King was killed. Ms. Naantaanbuu, who
appeared with Lee at the news conference, said Abernathy asked her
to prepare dinner for King's group at her home and Abernathy had
several drinks.
   ``Following dinner, Rev. Abernathy, who had had too much to
drink, asked (Ms. Naantaanbuu) if he could lie down on her bed,''
Lee said. ``She directed him to her bedroom, where he remained
asleep until about 3 a.m.''
   Ms. Naantaanbuu said the only time she was alone with King was
when they were trying to awaken Abernathy. She said she drove King,
Abernathy and Lee back to the Lorraine Motel, where King was
assassinated hours later.
   The news conference was called by the Coalition of Friends and
Beneficiaries of the Martin Luther King Jr. Dream. The group
includes many who were prominent in the civil rights movement of
the 1960s.
   The news conference was led by Benjamin L. Hooks, national
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.

   Folks in Boston and Chicago may have
been out of luck if they tried to buy fresh California strawberries
last Wednesday and Thursday.
   Electrical failures after last Tuesday's earthquake meant
125,000 crates of berries, many bound for East and Midwest markets
from this farming community, were left unrefrigerated overnight.
   By the time they reached their destinations, they were spoiled.
   A week after the quake forced more than 1,000 residents into
tents and shelters, employers still are assessing their losses.
   ``I would not be one to say losses will be minimal. Under the
circumstances, they might be considered minimal, but to the
individual they are pretty severe,'' said Santa Cruz County
Agricultural Commissioner Leonard Kraft.
   An estimated $5 million to $6 milion worth of crops were bruised
or damaged when the quake toppled storage bins, according to Ron
Tyler of the Agricultural Extension Service.
   And losses at the plants that process 40 percent of the
country's frozen foods won't be known until workers determine how
much of the produce shaken from 30-foot-high shelves can be
repacked and how much must be thrown out.
   Most companies say those losses should be small, indicating that
while production lines and shipments of frozen broccoli,
cauliflower and Brussels sprouts have been slowed, the industry
isn't devastated.
   ``I don't think there's a doubt the industry will rebound,''
Kraft said. ``It's the heart and soul of the area.''
   More than $7 million worth of packaged vegetables spilled onto
the warehouse floor at the Richard A. Shaw Inc. frozen food
company. But President Jeffrey Shaw said he expects most of the
vegetables can be repacked.
   ``We're hoping $500,000 (in losses) is a worst case,'' Shaw
said. ``We're hoping we can get it down to a 5 percent loss of
what's on the floor. Our focus is going to be on shipping
merchandise, ship now and clean up later. We've got to ship to
create space to speed up the clean-up.''
   Strawberry packers are expecting very little loss. ``The season
ends Nov. 1, so we're fortunate it happened at this time. There's
not really much to recover from since we're near the end anyway,''
said Herb Baum, president of Naturipe Berry Growers.
   But stalled production will be felt strongly by the 7,000
residents who harvest crops from local fields or work in the food
processing plants here.
   The personal losses they have suffered have been compounded by
the lack of a place to work. Green Giant expects to be closed for
at least two weeks, leaving 600 people out of work, and Shaw Inc.
is operating with about 200 of its 900 employees.
   ``Not only have they lost their jobs, but there are no
alternatives left in town,'' Jeffrey Shaw said.
   Even the agriculture industry, which makes up 65 percent of the
community's economy, may not be strong enough to rebuild the town
by itself.
   ``We have quite a large population in the city who work in
agriculture, and all the downtown store owners depend on people to
spend their paychecks at the store,'' Kraft said.
   ``A lot of people's homes are destroyed,'' he added. ``Those
people may work in agriculture, but that's not going to help.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush discussed the prospects for
peace in Lebanon in telephone calls with Pope John Paul II,
President Francois Mitterrand of France and King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia, the White House said today.
   Bush on Monday congratulated Fahd and the Arab League for
arranging talks in Taif, Saudi Arabia, that led to a breakthrough
agreement among Lebanese parliamentarians on a new national charter
for governing the torn country.
   Bush expressed the hope that the parliamentarians' work `` would
be a step in the direction of Lebanese reform,'' said Marlin
Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.
   The president also called Mitterrand to discuss the situation in
Lebanon, and on Tuesday he called the pope, who has made repeated
efforts to promote a peaceful settlement in the 14-year civil war
between Lebanon's Christian and Moslem factions.
   Fahd was one of three Arab leaders designated by the Arab League
last spring to press for constitutional reforms in Lebanon to end
the strife there. The Saudis are urging Lebanon's Parliament to
convene in Beirut Nov. 7 to elect a new speaker, approve political
reforms and elect a new president.
   Sixty-two Lebanese politicians fashioned the proposed charter in
three weeks of negotiations at Taif.
   Fitzwater said Bush was also on the phone Monday with West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ``to discuss events in Germany,
particularly after the resignation of (Communist party chief Erich)
Honecker and the selection of a new leader of East Germany.''
   Bush, in an interview published Wednesday in The New York Times,
said he was not worried about the possibility of a reunified
Germany heading off onto ``a neutralist path that puts them at
odds, or potentially at odds, with their NATO partners.''

   The city council is asking the state and
county to reopen the murder case of civil rights leader Medgar
Evers more than a quarter-century afer he was gunned down.
   A council member said the move indicates how much attitudes have
changed.
   ``Hopefully, the district attorney will follow through to
correct an injustice of the past,'' Councilman Louis Armstrong said
Tuesday after the vote.
   ``The motive for introducing this resolution was to begin
healing a festering wound created by a subversion of justice by the
state Sovereignty Commission,'' Armstrong said of the now-defunct
segregation watchdog agency.
   ``I think it was incumbent upon the city council to protect the
rights of one of its citizens who was murdered by bigotry and
hatred.''
   The city council's vote came a day after The Clarion-Ledger, a
Jackson newspaper, reported that in 1964 investigators from the
sovereignty commission helped the defense screen prospective jurors
at the first of two trials of Byron De La Beckwith, who was charged
in Evers' death.
   Armstrong's resolution asked the state attorney general and
Hinds County district attorney to reopen the investigation and
prosecution in connection with the civil rights leader's June 12,
1963, slaying.
   A secretary in the office of District Attorney Ed Peters said he
would be out of town all week and and no one else could comment on
whether he would reopen the case. Jim Warren, a special assistant
to Attorney General Mike Moore, said the decision would be up to
Peters. ``We would, however, offer him any assistance, if he so
requests,'' Warren said.
   The council, which has a majority of white members, voted 4-2,
with one council member absent.
   Beckwith was tried twice in 1964 by all-white juries for the
murder of Evers, a NAACP field secretary who was gunned down in the
driveway of his Jackson home. Both trials ended in hung juries.
   Prosecutors said Beckwith's fingerprint was on a gun found in
bushes near the slaying, and witnesses placed his car near the
scene.
   Beckwith said his gun was stolen.
   Councilman E C Foster said Tuesday that he voted for the
resolution because he'd like to see the case solved.
   ``Primariy, it's clear that the murderer is still free, and so
if by reopening the investigation we can bring the murderer to
justice, then I think that's what should happen,'' he said.
   Councilman Derwood Boyles, who voted against the resolution,
said Monday, ``As far as I'm concerned, that comes under the
heading of the district attorney and the attorney general, and I
don't personally think I should be telling them what to do.
   ``I think if Mr. Evers was here, he'd tell us we have more
important things to do than that,'' said Boyles.

   Seattle has been named America's Most Livable City and San
Francisco, now recovering from a devastating earthquake, was ranked
second, according to the 1989 edition of the Places Rated Almanac.
   The book ranks the top 10 metropolitan areas, in order, as
Seattle, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Washington, San Diego, Boston,
New York, Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., Louisville, Ky., and
Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., according to The Pittsburgh Press and the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
   The rankings in the almanac's third edition were based on
scoring in categories including crime, health care, the
environment, transportation, education, the arts, recreation and
climate.
   ``We seem to be suffering an embarrassment of riches,'' said
Steve Morris, president of the Seattle-King County Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
   ``All these ratings of late rate us tops and with my visitor
industry-economic development hat on, of course we think it's
wonderful,'' Morris continued. ``With my resident hat on, I guess
we are all starting to get to the point where we wish we could keep
our secret a little bit better.''
   The bottom 10 areas, starting with the lowest ranking, were Pine
Bluff, Ark.; Odessa, Texas; Laredo, Texas; Yuba City, Calif.; St.
Joseph, Mo.; Victoria, Texas; Greeley, Colo.; Gadsden, Ala.;
Casper, Wyo.; Albany, Ga.; and Naples, Fla., according to USA Today.
   Pittsburgh was named America's Most Livable City in the 1985
edition of the almanac. It was also published in 1981.
   The publisher, Prentice Hall Travel Books, had planned to
announce the findings Nov. 3 in New York City. After the Pittsburgh
newspapers and other news organizations obtained copies, the
company moved the news conference to Thursday.
   Suzanne Smith, a senior publicist for Prentice Hall Travel
Books, declined to comment on the rankings Tuesday, although
bookstores in Pittsburgh already have received copies.
   ``At this point, we're not verifying anything,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today
began a visit to a thriving Soviet neighbor, seeking Finnish help
in bolstering his country's ailing economy.
   Accompanied by his wife, Raisa, Gorbachev was given a red-carpet
airport welcome by President Mauno Koivisto and driven under
overcast skies to the waterfront presidential residence in downtown
Helsinki.
   Finland has long sought to maintain its independence and
neutrality, but for centuries it has generally been subservient to
its giant neighbor. The nations fought bitter wars twice during
World War II, and Finland each time was forced to grant territorial
concessions to the Soviet aggressors.
   Though long considered to be under Moscow's thumb, increasingly
liberal East European countries and Soviet republics are using
Finland as a model of how to cooperate with Moscow, maintain
independence and run an effective economy.
   A handful of demonstrators were among several hundred Finns who
lined the street near the palace to greet the Soviet leader, many
cheering and waving small Finnish and Soviet flags.
   The demonstrators wanted their government to seek the return of
Karelia, an eastern region which Finland ceded to the Soviets in
1944.
   ``Give us back our Karelia!'' the protesters shouted in Finnish
as Gorbachev reviewed the honor guard in a light rain.
   ``I want the Soviets to discuss with us whether they would
return it, since they said Stalin took it and that it was an
unwarranted aggression. ... What would be wrong with correcting
that mistake?'' said Martti Siirala, 66, who said he was born in
the annexed territory.
   Finnish officials have said they did not expect the issue to be
raised during Gorbachev's three-day visit, and they said most Finns
accept Soviet control of the region. About 400,000 Finns were
displaced by the annexation.
   Gorbachev, whose economic reforms need an infusion of Western
technology and business acumen, planned to sign a five-year trade
agreement and several specific accords for new joint businesses.
   One agreement is to set the groundwork for new industries in the
Kola Peninsula, which until recently was a closed military area. It
is the home of the Soviet Northern Fleet and the base for northern
defenses.
   In the Gorbachev entourage was Vaino Vyalyas, the Communist
Party chief of Estonia. His inclusion reflected recognition of the
cultural links between the Finns and the people of the Baltic
republic across the Gulf of Finland.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, also in the
entourage, reiterated in an interview that Moscow has no plans to
hinder East bloc countries instituting democratic reform.
   ``The Brezhnev doctrine as you called it is dead and there is no
hope of revival,'' he told ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
referring to the concept of intervention named after the late
Soviet leader.
   ``These countries _ Poland, Hungary and others _ are members of
the Warsaw Pact, which we want to disband together simultaneously
with the NATO pact, and they are still members of the mutual
council on economic assistance,'' he said.
   Despite a bloody history, the Soviets and Finns have close
business ties, based for many years on the barter of Soviet oil for
Finnish goods.
   Finland still is the Soviets' second-largest trading partner in
the capitalist world after West Germany. But its own trade
dependency on the Soviet Union declined as oil prices plunged.
   The Finns increasingly have turned toward western Europe and
shifted their economy from basic industries and shipbuilding to
electronics and high technology.
   Finland's trade with the Soviets fell from 25 percent of its
total exports in 1983 to just 13 percent this year. At the same
time its own economy became one of the fastest growing in the West,
expanding about 5 percent a year.
   The two countries share a 793-mile border.
   In 1948 Finland and the Soviet Union signed a Treaty of
Friendship and Cooperation which guaranteed the Soviets'
northwestern front. Finland adopted a cautious neutral foreign
policy, which now is being held up as a model by reformers in the
Baltic states and others in the Soviet sphere.
   As of next year, residents of Estonia and the other Baltic
republics will take over management of their local economies from
Moscow, opening the way for further Finnish and western involvement.
   Finland already has daily ferry service to Tallinn, the Estonian
capital, and residents of the two regions, which are linguistic and
cultural cousins, can watch each other's television.

<HEAD>Task Force Urges Streamlining of Civil Court Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges and lawyers must do more to keep
non-criminal cases in federal courts from taking too long and
costing too much, Congress was told Wednesday.
   ``The excessive cost and delay associated with litigating civil
cases in America should no longer be tolerated and can be
forcefully addressed through procedural reform, more active case
management by judges and better efforts by attorneys and their
clients,'' said a 39-page report prepared by a special task force.
   The report is the result of a nine-month study by 36 lawyers and
law professors whose effort was suggested by Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Biden called the report's recommendations ``an important and
encouraging start,'' and said his committee ``will give a high
priority to civil justice reform.''
   The report focuses on federal courts only, but the task force
said its recommendations could be applied to state and local courts
as well.
   The task force urged Congress to provide ``a mix of suggestions
and incentives'' to spark change, ``and then let those who use the
system fill in the details.''
   ``Our core recommendations allow each federal court ... to
develop its own set of reforms for reducing delay and litigation
costs within some broad parameters that Congress would establish
through federal legislation,'' the report says.
   The task force recommended:
   _That Congress require all federal trial judges to streamline
the pretrial exchange of information between both sides of a
lawsuit. That process, called ``discovery,'' accounts for an
estimated 60 percent of all federal litigation costs.
   _Each trial court's streamlining plan should include a system of
assigning differing ``tracks'' to cases of different complexity.
Fixed timetables and deadlines for completion of discovery and the
start of a trial would depend on what track a case is assigned.
   _Judges should adopt ``a firm and consistent policy for
minimizing continuances'' or exceptions to the fixed deadlines
imposed.
   _Clients, either in person or by telephone, should participate
in any court-sponsored settlement conferences. That would make it
``impossible for the attorneys to delay settlement discussions,
often for weeks or months, with the time-honored excuse, `Let me
get back to you after I've discussed this with my client,''' the
task force report said.
   _Judges should not rely on magistrates as heavily as some now do
in keeping track of civil cases that have not yet gone to trial.
   The report also recommended increasing judges' administrative
staffs and raising judges' salaries.
   And the report called for cooperation from the country's lawyers.
   ``The nation needs _ and must get _ a substantial commitment
from the bar to address this challenge as well,'' it said. ``There
is a consensus that some litigation costs are incurred as a direct
outgrowth of the incentives that have been built into the private
legal industry itself.''
   The task force noted that the legal profession increasingly is
dominated by escalating lawyer salaries and heavier demands for
billable hours.
   ``The time has come for the profession to examine the impact of
costs on the delivery of legal services and the critical question
whether increasing costs have impeded access to the courts,'' the
task force report said.

<HEAD>Hope Waning for Survival of Boy and Pony Missing Since Sunday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Searchers planned to use a helicopter
equipped with a heat-sensing device as the search resumed today for
a 9-year-old boy missing since Sunday with his pony in rugged range
country.
   The temperature dipped below freezing again this morning in the
search area about 15 miles north of Chemult, in central Oregon.
said Dexter Patmon, a spokesman for the Klamath County sheriff's
office. About 100 searchers on horseback and 100 on foot resumed
the search at daybreak, he said.
   Clouds and wet weather that had kept aircraft grounded most of
Monday and Tuesday cleared up overnight, said Patmon. An Air
National Guard helicopter with infrared sensing equipment on board
would be used sometime today, he said.
   Nathan Madsen was riding his pony, Tony, when he disappeared
during a cattle roundup near his family's ranch Sunday afternoon.
Any tracks they may have left have been erased by snow, sleet and
rain.
   The boy's chances are waning, but searchers continued to hold
out hope that he would be found alive, Chuck Hoy of Klamath
County's search and rescue unit said Tuesday night.
   ``If he's got himself into a little cave or a tree trunk or some
form of shelter, it is possible to survive,'' Hoy said. ``Every
night he's out there, the likelihood is less, but it is very, very
possible.''
   Searchers have concentrated on a rugged box canyon on the Little
Deschutes River northwest of Chemult, east of the Cascade Range in
south-central Oregon.
   The 13-square-mile canyon has been searched ``top to bottom,
side to side, three times over,'' rescue chief Virgil Johnson said.
``I just don't think he's in there. To be honest with you, it
doesn't look good.''
   The boy was dressed in chaps and a rain slicker for cold, wet
weather and knew what to do, his mother, Sarah Madsen, said Tuesday.
   ``Thank God ... he has been trained on what to do out there in
the woods. I have to trust in Nathan because I know he knows what
to do,'' she said.
   ``He may have panicked when he first realized he was lost; but
after that I'm sure his common sense took over. I'm sure he is OK.
He may be cold and he may be wet, but I'm sure he's OK.''
   ``According to his mother, the boy and the pony have been
together for a long time,'' Hoy said of the 10-year-old sorrel.
``The pony is very social. The pony probably would not leave the
boy.''

   Buddy was no ordinary tomcat. At 6 years
old, he'd survived two broken jaws, innumerable fights, a fall from
a fourth-story window and various internal injuries.
   But Buddy, like many family pets, was powerless to fight the
enemy he faced at 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17.
   The 7.1-magnitude Bay area earthquake that took dozens of lives,
injured thousands and caused more than $7 billion damage also
claimed a large number of pets.
   Just like human victims, pets were trapped in falling buildings,
consumed by fires and crushed in cars. But perhaps the largest
numbers were swallowed by panic in a world gone temporarily haywire.
   Buddy and another cat, a spayed female named Poochie, lived in
an apartment building partially demolished by fire the night of the
quake. It has since been razed, said Buddy's veterinarian, Lee
Morris.
   ``They esccaped from the burning apartment. Both cats ran
outdoors. Buddy died. He was burned. They found his body. It's
pretty ironic that he didn't make it through this because if
anybody could have, it would have been him,'' Morris said.
   Poochie did survive. ``When her owner went back in for 15
minutes before they wrecked the building, she had come back. She
(Poochie's owner) brought her in on Thursday. She smelled like
smoke, but she was OK,'' Morris said.
   ``What was nightmarish about the quake was, not only did we
scare the bejesus out of the cats and dogs, but we lost power,''
said Rich Avanzino, president of the San Francisco Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   ``Disoriented animals rushing hither and yon were crossing
streets with abandon, coming upon motorists who no longer had the
benefit of street lights,'' Avanzino said.
   Several veterinarians told the story of Spot, a black,
3-year-old female cat who, like dockworker Buck Helm, defied odds
to survive.
   Spot was sunning herself on an apartment building windowsill,
Avanzino said. ``She was dislodged and fell 10 floors to the
concrete. She was rushed here and came out with only a broken leg.
That's one lucky cat,'' he said.
   Dr. John Holden at Mission Pet Hospital treated about 20
four-legged quake victims. ``There were some traumatic injuries.
One cat was crushed under boxes. There were a lot of glass
injuries,'' he said.
   ``The cat crushed by boxes came in pretty gorked out but he's
doing better neurologically,'' he added.
   He is sure many pets have yet to be found. No one will ever know
how many dogs, cats, guinea pigs, fish, birds, reptiles and other
pets were killed in the quake, he said.
   At least two dozen animals who bolted from their homes during
the quake have been reunited with their owners by San Francisco
Animal Care and Control, said Director Carl Friedman. A dozen more
are being cared for by the agency.
   Avanzino and other SPCA employees spent the night of the temblor
in quake zones, handing out pet food, leashes, cat carriers,
dishes, bowls and water, he said.
   Since then, the SPCA has been working to arrange for temporary
homes for animals whose owners were left homeless, Avanzino said.
   Dan Harberts, owner of Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park in Napa,
said he had arranged for the burials of at least two dogs who died
of earthquake-related injuries.
   The veterinarians said there were few ways to protect pets from
earthquake injury or death. It's important to have carriers or ways
to confine animals in an emergency, Holden said. And returning to
normal as quickly as possible will help an animal after a quake.
   Morris, whose patients in addition to Poochie included a dog who
went through a window and cut up his nose and several cats who
pulled their toenails out in struggles to get away, said the best
thing owners can do is ``offer to your pets the same comfort now
that they have always offered you.''
   And, he added, don't be upset if a pet hides, cowers, refuses
food, pouts, mopes, vomits or wets where he or she shouldn't for a
while.
   ``I've talked to about 30 people who describe psychological
problems with their pets. In some cases, the people are stressed
and are reading their own problems into their pets,'' Morris said.

   Tens of thousands of people poured into
streets and parks of the capital today to celebrate reconstruction
of the southern port of Faw, which was almost destroyed during the
war with Iran.
   ``Faw has risen again, dressed in colorful clothes woven from
the eyelashes of our valiant men and built upon their sweat,''
President Saddam Hussein said in the televised speech.
   The government has spent millions of dollars to celebrate what
government newspapers called ``a miracle of construction, building
a new town in only 114 days.''
   Arriving in Baghdad to take part in the celebrations were
Jordan's King Hussein and presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Ali
Abdullah Saleh of North Yemen. Saudi Arabian Defense Minister
Prince Sultan delivered a congratulatory letter from King Fahd.
   Official celebrations in Faw were expected later in the week,
part of three days of festivities in Baghdad and the rebuilt city.
Faw lies 400 yards from Iranian outposts.
   Before the Persian Gulf war with Iran broke out in September
1980, Faw was a dusty oil terminal town with population of about
50,000. The Iranians captured the town in February 1986, but Iraqi
forces retook it in April 1988 in the first of a series of
offensives. Hostilities ended with a cease-fire in August 1988.
   Saddam thanked other Arab countries for taking part in the
celebrations and making donations for the rebuilding of the town.
   Schools and most government departments were closed as students
lined the main highway from the airport to downtown Baghdad, waving
pictures of the arriving Arab leaders and flags of their countries.

   Officials have ousted operators of a
program providing meals to the elderly that former President Reagan
once praised as a national model but later was accused of
mismanagement and poor service.
   The county Council on Aging ordered locks changed Tuesday at a
recreation center where it canceled the contract under which
Frances Freeman operated the South Park Area Council's meal program
for six years.
   On Thursday the Tucson Urban League will take over the remainder
of a $70,000 contract to feed 75 to 80 people a hot lunch each day,
said Marian Lupu, executive director of the Council on Aging.
   Ms. Freeman's group had the contract with the state- and
federally subsidized Council on Aging since 1983. She ran a
food-for-the-elderly program with local funds for 13 years before
that.
   Ms. Lupu said monitoring by the Council on Aging and an audit by
the state Department of Economic Security showed ``a great number
of irregularities in the way the program has been delivered to the
participants.''
   The Council on Aging accused Ms. Freeman's group of cutting meal
portions and mishandling sign-in sheets that are supposed to verify
that recipients get served, said Diana Edwards, a council program
monitor.
   In 1982, then-President Reagan pointed to Ms. Freeman's meals
program as an outstanding model of social service volunteerism at a
time of federal cuts in social programs.
   Ms. Edwards said her agency worked with Ms. Freeman's group
since 1983 trying to bring it into contract compliance. She said
that last year it lost the contract for home delivery of meals, in
May for transportation of about 25 people to the center and on
Tuesday for providing meals at the center.
   George Logan, assistant director for management review at the
Department of Economic Security in Phoenix, said the attorney
general's office would determine whether criminal charges should be
filed. He said, ``There is that potential; very definitely.''
   Margo Cowan, a community activist who identified herself as
secretary of the South Park Area Council, told The Associated Press
that she, Ms. Freeman and other officials of the group would have
no comment.
   But the Tucson Citizen quoted Ms. Freeman as saying she never
was told directly that Council on Aging funding was being cut off
and first heard about it Tuesday morning as she was on her way to
the center.
   Ms. Freeman said she plans to keep helping elderly people
without the funding.

   One of four Black Liberation Army
members who killed two white teen-agers in 1974 in an effort to set
off racial violence has been paroled from prison after serving 14{
years of a 199-year term.
   Brad Evans, 34, was freed Tuesday after he agreed to move to
DeKalb, Ill., where he will live with a brother and work in data
processing. He agreed not to return to Florida without permission
of the state Parole Commission, officials said. He is on parole
until 2173.
   Relatives of Stephen Orlando and Stephen Lamont Roberts, the two
teen-agers killed in random attacks that BLA members said were
launched to spark a racial war, vehemently opposed Evans' release.
   The Jacksonville BLA wasn't connected with a West Coast group of
the same name.
   Evans' last two attempts for parole were rejected because of
opposition from the victims' families and the judge in the case,
and the commission at one point pushed Evans' next parole review
date to 1999.
   But after Evans' family devised a plan for him to live in
Illinois, the commission agreed to free him.
   ``The majority of the commission was convinced that the Brad
Evans who went to prison in troubled times is not the Brad Evans
there now,'' said Guy Revell, chairman of the Florida Parole
Commission.
   After Orlando, 18, was shot and stabbed, the group sent a tape
to his mother, Marian Mallory, saying he had been ``tried, found
guilty and executed'' for political crimes against blacks.
   The group also sent tapes to television and radio stations
warning that ``more white devils will die.''
   Evans was convicted of second-degree murder in Orlando's death
and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Roberts' death.
   Jacob John Dougan, the leader of the group, whose death sentence
has been overturned twice, was resentenced to death for Orlando's
murder in 1987.
   Elwood Clark Barclay also was sentenced to die for Orlando's
murder, but the Florida Supreme Court reduced his sentence to life
in 1980.
   A fourth defendant, Dwayne Crittendon, was sentenced to 199
years. His parole hearing is set for August.

   Police scoured the city today for suspects in the
abduction and shootings of a pregnant woman and her husband, whose
mobile phone transmitted the sounds of sirens that directed
rescuers to them.
   The woman died of a head wound after doctors delivered her
two-months premature baby by Caesarean section. Relatives said they
were told there was little hope for the infant's survival. The
husband was in critical condition.
   Charles and Carol Stuart were abducted while leaving Brigham and
Women's Hospital, where they'd attended a birthing class Monday
night.
   Their abductor forced them to drive to the city's Mission Hill
district, then robbed and shot them.
   Stuart then used the car's cellular phone to call police, but
could not give his location. When he lost consciousness, operators
listened on the phone for the sirens of passing police cars.
   Mrs. Stuart's baby was delivered at the hospital she'd left
hours earlier. A hospital spokeswoman would say only that the baby
was alive but would not comment further.
   The couple had chosen Christopher as the baby's name because
doctors had said he would be born the day after Christmas, said
Rosemary Leone, aunt of the 33-year-old Mrs. Stuart.
   ``If you could only see how beautifully formed he is,'' she
said. ``He looked perfect. They told us to stroke his face because
they said he would need a lot of love.''
   ``She wanted this baby so badly. But they don't think there's
much hope for him,'' she said.
   ``She had what she always wanted. A good job, a husband, a
house, and soon a baby. And then one bastard came and took it all
away,'' said Mrs. Stuart's cousin, Cheryl Leone.
   Stuart, 29, general manager of a fur store in Boston's Back Bay,
remained in critical condition today with a gunshot wound to the
abdomen, a Boston City Hospital spokesman said.
   At a news conference today, Joseph Saia, deputy police
superintendent, said Stuart's condition had kept him from assisting
in the investigation.
   ``Hopefully he will recover and provide invaluable help to the
case,'' he said.
   Police have no suspects but Mayor Raymond Flynn said
fingerprints were found in the Stuarts' car, along with two
.38-caliber slugs.
   ``We now need people to come forward and provide whatever
information they have, whether they saw something or heard
something,'' Flynn said. ``Police officers will be combing the
(Mission Hill) public housing development and talking to everyone
and anyone.''
   The gunman apparently thought the Stuarts were police officers
after seeing the car phone, said Joseph Dunford, deputy police
superintendent. Before shooting the couple, according to Dunford,
the gunman said, ``I think you're five-o,'' slang for police.
   Stuart battled for himself and his wife in the minutes after
they were shot and left for dead, police said. But as he spoke to
police on his telephone, he faded in and out of consciousness while
his pregnant wife lay dying next to him.
   He cried in pain and confusion. Not knowing where he was, he
couldn't tell state police dispatcher Gary McLaughlin where to send
help.
   ``Oh man, it hurts and my wife has stopped gurgling, she's
stopped breathing,'' Stuart called out, according to a transcript
released Tuesday by police.
   Then there was silence.
   ``Chuck, can you hear me? Chuck, Chuck can you hear me, buddy,''
McLaughlin pleaded. ``Pick up the phone, Chuck. Chuck? Come on
Chuck, can you hear me, Chuck? Chuck, pick up the phone, I can hear
you breathing there Chuck, come on, buddy.''
   Still, nothing.
   McLaughlin instructed Stuart at one point to open his door or
window to see if he could identify some landmark, so that help
could find him.
   But Stuart only replied: ``I'm blanking out.''
   ``You can't blank out on me, I need you man. Chuck? Chuck?''
   In a desperate effort to home in on the car, police in cruisers
were told to flick their sirens off and on, one by one. McLaughlin
was able to tell which cruiser was near the Stuarts' car by
listening to the sirens coming over the phone.
   ``Get my wife out,'' Stuart told the officers who found him.
   The ambulance crew that cae to the aid of the Stuarts had been
riding with a camera crew from the CBS-TV series ``Rescue 911,''
which tells real-life stories about rescue operations.
   The crew videotaped Stuart regaining consciousness and talking
about the attack as paramedics worked on him en route to Boston
City Hospital, and was allowed into the emergency room, CBS
spokesman Mike Silver said in New York.
   The mayor asked that every available detective be put on the
case, said police spokeswoman Jill Reilly.
   At a news conference, Flynn was asked why the killing was
getting so much attention when shootings occur almost daily in
other distressed areas of the city.
   ``No matter whether it happens in Roxbury, Charlestown, Back Bay
or Beacon Hill, whatever area or color or ethnicity, it will be
handled in the same aggressive and fair way by the Boston Police
Department,'' he replied.
   Ted Kakas, an owner of the fur store where Stuart has worked for
eight years, said couple had just celebrated their fourth wedding
anniversary. The child was the couple's first.
   The couple, from suburban Reading, were mindful of the rise of
violence in the city, friends said.
   ``Chuck and I had talked about the number of shootings that had
gone on there,'' said fellow employee Peter Jaworski. ``It seemed
almost daily, the number of people getting shot.
   ``So many senseless things going on,'' Jaworski said, choking on
his words.

   Jim Bakker, head bowed and bound hand and
foot, was led into federal prison to begin a 45-year sentence for
defrauding thousands of followers of his television ministry.
   ``My reports are he's going through the process very normally,''
Warden Don Southerland said after Bakker arrived at the Talladega
Federal Correctional Institution late Tuesday.
   After surrendering his valuables, showering, leaving his
fingerprints and donning prison garb, Bakker entered the cell he
will share with ``another lightweight security inmate,''
Southerland said.
   After his arrival, the founder of PTL kept his eyes on the
ground as six guards hustled him from a brown sedan to the entrance
of the rural, medium-security prison in east Alabama.
   Officials said he would stay here for about two weeks before
transfer to another prison.
   ``Obviously, he is not a normal inmate, but he is being
processed as a normal inmate,'' Southerland said.
   Two former Bakker aides sentenced a month ago to more than 17
years each after being convicted of income tax evasion reported to
an Alabama prison today. David Taggert and his brother, James,
arrived at the minimum-security prison at Maxwell Air Force Base in
Montgomery.
   Bakker had no comment for the dozens of reporters gathered at
the red-brick prison surrounded by two 15-foot fences topped with
razor wire.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter of Charlotte, N.C., who
sentenced Bakker on Tuesday, also fined him $500,000. Saying that
Bakker was unrepentant and still trying to milk supporters for
money, he ordered him to begin serving the long sentence
immediately.
   Bakker would have to serve at least 10 years in prison before
achieving parole unless a planned appeal is successful.
   Southerland said Bakker was allowed to contact his family before
being placed in his two-man cell for the night.
   The warden said he had no details on what calls Bakker made.
Baksides had an agreement not
to reveal the nature of the sanctions. ``I could only confirm what
the Turkish spokesman said today,'' the U.S. official told the
Associated Press.
   The Senate committee approved the measure despite a full-scale
lobbying campaign by the Turkish government against it.
   The government has taken the sanctions to put pressure on the
U.S. administration to make efforts to block the adoption of the
resolution by the full Senate, said a government official speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   He said the defense cooperation pact between Turkey and the

   A judge sent evangelist Jim Bakker
directly to jail to start a 45-year sentence for defrauding
followers of millions of dollars, saying people were ``sick of
being saps for money-grubbing preachers.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Tuesday also fined the
defrocked PTL founder $500,000, concluding that Bakker had
continued to milk the faithful even after his conviction for
overselling memberships in a Christian vacation retreat.
   The 49-year-old television evangelist left the courtroom in leg
irons and handcuffs on his way to federal prison in Alabama.
Depending on the outcome of an appeal, he will serve at least 10
years before being eligible for parole.
   Two of Bakker's former aides reported today to another,
minimum-security prison in Alabama to begin serving sentences they
received a month ago _ more than 18 years for David Taggart and 17
for his brother, James.
   Prosecutors said the man who founded the once mighty PTL
religious empire raised thousands of dollars since his Oct. 5th
conviction and needed to be imprisoned to stop him from using TV
and the mails to raise more.
   ``He's able to walk out of this courtroom today and continue to
perpetuate this fraud,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller told
the judge. ``He hasn't blinked.''
   Potter read a letter that Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye,
mailed last month from their new TV ministry in Orlando, Fla.,
asking 300 supporters to send in $1,000 apiece to alleviate a
financial crisis.
   ``Those of us who do have a religion are sick of being saps for
money-grubbing preachers and priests,'' Potter said. ``Worst of
all, it appears that Mr. Bakker feels he was deserving of his gains
from the little people who sent in their savings.''
   Potter refrained from ordering Bakker to make restitution to his
victims, saying that issue needed to be resolved in bankruptcy
court.
   Bakker's fall from power began in 1987 with revelations about a
sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn, who
received hush money, leading to the unraveling of the ministry.
   ``I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' Bakker said before
sentencing. ``I have sinned. But never in my life did I intend to
defraud anyone.''
   Prosecutors didn't accept his apology.
   ``This man is a con man, a common criminal,'' said Miller.
``He's ready, willing and able to pick it up where he left it off.
He's ready to go back to the henhouse.''
   Bakker stood and stared straight ahead as the sentence was read.
Potter then sent him to the medium-security federal prison at
Talledega, Ala., where he arrived late Tuesday.
   Warden Don Southerland said Bakker was to spend the night in a
cell with another inmate, and remain there a few weeks before being
assigned to another institution.
   Defense attorney Harold Bender had asked that Bakker be freed on
bond pending an appeal. But Potter said he posed a substantial
flight risk.
   ``He has supporters who think he can do no wrong and who say
they are willing to do anything for him,'' Potter said. ``I believe
them.''
   Bakker's 19-year-old daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, was led
sobbing from the courtroom. Mrs. Bakker did not attend the trial.
   Bakker was convicted of 23 counts of fraud and one count of
conspiracy in an indictment that charged him with diverting $3.7
million in ministry finances to finance his lavish lifestyle out of
the $158 million sent him by followers.
   Bakker had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years, but the judge
consolidated the 24 counts to nine and sentenced Bakker to five
years on each. Potter, known as ``Maximum Bob,'' had given stiff
sentences in the convictions of three top Bakker aides, Richard
Dortch and the Taggart brothers. The three cooperated with the
government in exchange for lightened sentences.
   Nearly 153,000 people sent money to Bakker between 1984 and 1987
to become ``lifetime partners'' at the PTL's Heritage USA retreat
in nearby Fort Mill, S.C. Bakker was convicted of selling
guarantees of lodging at the retreat when he knew rooms weren't
available. He spent contributors' money on luxurious homes, fancy
cars, jewelry, vacations, an air-conditioned doghouse, a swimming
pool heated to 90 degrees, and gold-plated bathroom fixtures.
   Bakker's six-week trial was delayed for three days in September
when he suffered an emotional collapse, claiming that wild animals
were attacking him. Hurricane Hugo caused a one-day delay.
   Bakker resigned PTL in March 1987 after it was revealed that he
had paid Hahn $265,000 in ministry money to keep quiet about their
1980 tryst.
   Hahn applauded Tuesday's sentence.
   ``It cannot repay those millions of dollars, and the years of
work people did to make it, but at least it's a start,'' she said
in a telephone interview from her West Hollwood, Calif., home. ``At
least people can feel like they won't be taken for fools.''
   ``Jim Bakker's no crook,'' said Bakker supporter Helen Gordon.
``The news media made him look like one.''

   Some 200 earthquake victims still are
missing, but no army of rescuers is desperately pawing through
rubble to find them.
   Those 200 _ and more than 400 other snakes and lizards _ escaped
from their cages Oct. 17 when the 7.1 quake smashed glass and
overturned enclosures where the cold-blooded reptiles lived at the
East Bay Vivarium.
   ``We had flashlights. The floor was covered with baby snakes,''
said Rebecca Lance, Vivarium manager. ``We just grabbed them up and
threw them into a huge garbage bucket.''
   The Vivarium, home to 10,000 lizards, snakes, amphibians and
rodents, is about 50 feet from the quake-ruined section of
Interstate 880. Employees ran to help the human victims; when they
returned, they discovered the successful break-out.
   ``I hope this building is secure, I hope they're not making it
into theneighborhood. But we've torn this place from top to bottom
looking for them,'' Owen Maercks, one of three owners of the
19-year-old business, said Tuesday.
   All the escapees are non-poisonous. They include several $500
foot-long dumeril boa constrictors, three $600 monitor lizards and
assorted reptiles, worth $35 to $500 each.
   ``You name it, they hid there,'' said Maercks. ``We found them
behind pictures on the wall, hanging from the picture wires. We
found them under cages, on top of cages. At one point I changed
from tennis shoes to boots. When I went back to put my tennis shoes
on I found a snake in each shoe.''

   Cocaine-producing and consuming nations
wrapped up a two-day meeting Wednesday, agreeing to tighten their
dragnet on drug traffickers and encourage coca farmers to plant
other cash crops.
   Spain and other European countries that have seen a dramatic
expansion in the drug trade in recent years pledged greater
involvement.
   ``This meeting represents a great step forward in broad-based,
material support by the major European countries,'' said Acting
U.S. Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis, adding: ``It would
not be helpful to elaborate on the specifics of material offered.''
   He said the group also agreed to work toward streamlining the
extradition process and establish a network of treaties ``that will
eliminate any hiding place in the world'' for drug traffickers.
   The meeting brought representatives of the 12-nation European
Economic Community, the United States and Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia together for the first time to discuss material and legal
methods to halt the flow of cocaine.
   In the past three years the amount of cocaine seized in the EEC
has tripled as drug traffickers turn from the United States in
search of new markets.
   An official said cocaine seizures in Spain last year represented
62 percent of the EEC total of about six tons, and that Italy is
another major point of entry into Europe.
   ``We feel that the recognition (by EEC countries) of our
situation represents a rather big step forward,'' said Armando
Lecaroz, Peru's special drug ambassador.
   Spanish Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera said the group
agreed on the importance of investigating and halting the
laundering of drug money and would look into ways to control the
export from EEC countries of chemicals used to transform coca leave
paste into cocaine.
   On Tuesday at the close of a Hispano-French summit in the
Spanish city of Valladolid, French President Francois Mitterrand
called for a crackdown on money-laundering and said banks ``will
have to open up their books and their accounts.''
   Most of the world's coca leaves are grown in the Andean
highlands of Peru and Bolivia. Most of the coca leave paste is
processed into cocaine and shipped to the rest of the world from
Colombia.
   Representatives of all three producer countries stressed the
importance of crop substitution programs to wean growers away from
coca as well as export incentives and financing to make substitute
crops commercially attractive.
   Participants agreed in a final communique to draw up and secure
funding for appropriate crop substitution programs.
   Spain's special drug coordinator Miguel Solans said concrete aid
in the form of vehicles, training of police and narcotics agents,
weapons and judicial protection programs would be negotiated
bilaterally.

   Former President Ronald Reagan on Wednesday urged
Japan to leave a great legacy of its ``golden age'' to history by
helping Poland and other communist countries achieve freedom and
democracy.
   ``This is a golden age for Japan,'' Reagan told some 600 people
attending a banquet in his honor. ``A genuine golden age provides
the world with a distinctive idea, a philosophy, a cause, a greater
good.
   ``So what will be Japan's legacy?'' he asked.
   Reagan called on Japan to join the United States in promoting
freedom and democracy, particularly in communist countries moving
toward democracy.
   ``Great endeavors make great nations. Let Japan undertake this
great endeavor to help save Poland, Hungary and Eastern Europe. I
know you will,'' he said.
   In a television interview earlier in the day, the 78-year-old
former president said the United States and Japan are good friends
who have made significant progress in their sometimes rocky trade
relations.
   ``There are just a few little itchy things here and there that
we still are working on from both sides, and part of our problem is
our own Congress that we have to bring into line,'' Reagan said.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States last year totaled
$52 billion, according to U.S. figures.
   Reagan said he believes Sony Corp.'s recent purchase of Columbia
Pictures for $3.4 billion was welcome in the United States.
   ``I just have the feeling that maybe Hollywood needs some
outsiders to bring back decency and good taste to some of the
pictures that are being made,'' the former movie star said.
   The interview was with the Fuji Television network, owned by the
Fujisankei Communications Group, Japan's largest media conglomerate
and Reagan's host during his nine-day, $7 million visit. Company
officials said the banquet was intended to raise funds for Reagan's
presidential library.
   Reagan received a standing ovation and a warm toast from former
Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, who said Reagan would be ``remembered
forever in the annals of world history'' for his contributions to
peace and democracy.
   Many of Fujisankei's dozens of media organizations espouse
conservatism and nationalism. At Wednesday evening's dinner,
Fujisankei Co-chairman Hiroaki Shikanai said his company was
determined to ``do our best to serve as a communication medium
between the Japan and the United States.''
   Fujisankei officials have refused comment on reports the Reagans
are being paid $2 million for their visit.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, also are visiting as guests of the
Japanese government, which Monday awarded him one of its highest
honors for promoting free trade and friendship between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
   The House today sustained President Bush's
veto of a bill that would have allowed federally financed Medicaid
abortions for victims of rape and incest.
   The vote was 231 to 191 in favor of override, but that fell 51
votes short of the two-thirds margin needed.
   Abortion-rights supporters, who had won a surprising victory two
weeks ago for more liberal abortion provisions, failed in today's
vote to end a prohibition that has been written in federal law for
nearly a decade.
   Supporters of expanding federally financed abortions for poor
women had acknowledged they faced a difficult task in trying to
raise a two-thirds House majority for an override. They won a
216-206 vote two weeks ago.
   An override also would have require two-thirds approval by the
Senate.
   The vote followed an emotion-packed debate on the House floor,
in which abortion-rights forces condemned Bush's veto as an
unconscionable infringement on the rights of poor women and
children victimized by rape and incest _ and one that will bring
political damage to Republicans.
   Abortion foes cast the issue as a moral one that would invite
widespread federal financing of abortions.
   ``This president can't stop (Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio)
Noriega. He can't decide what to do to roll back communism ... But
boy, can he show the poor women of this country who's boss,'' said
Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., a leader of abortion-rights lawmakers.
   ``If you're a poor woman, George Bush is saying to you, `Just
say no to rape; Just say no to incest.' What a leader,'' Aucoin
said.
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a leader of the anti-abortion
forces, said the measure was ``vague, imprecise, and if enacted
into law might open the floodgates to aboriton funding.''
   Another abortion foe, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``I have
letters here from women who have been raped who say, `Thank God I
didn't have an abortion.'''
   In an indication of how politically difficult the issue was
regarded, the House Republican leader, Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill.,
said he would vote with Bush while suggesting he could change
positions later.
   ``I'm obliged obviously as the leader to support the president
in this effort,'' Michel said. ``That isn't to say that sometime
down the road that position won't be modified to some degree, but I
think we ought to talk about it.''
   The liberalized abortion language passed the House on a 216-206
vote two weeks ago. The measure, which cleared the Senate by a
wider margin, is part of a $156.7 billion appropriations bill for
education, labor and health programs.
   One Democrat who had voted against the liberalization told the
House today he would change positions and vote to overrride. Rep.
William Natcher, D-Ky., chairman of the appropriations subcommittee
that wrote the spending bill, said ``I like George Bush. ... But
Mr. Speaker, he's wrong this time.''
   Bush said he was seeking ``room for flexibility'' on the issue
immediately after the House vote. But under pressure from
anti-abortion supporters he hardened his stand and vetoed the bill
Saturday.
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today the
passage of tougher restrictions on abortion by the Pennsylvania
House on Tuesday ``certainly does show that there's strong feelings
on both sides of this issue.'' He said the president has no plans
to campaign for passage of state laws restricting abortion.
   On Tuesday, freshman Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., reversed
his previous stand and said he would vote in favor of an override.
   ``I think it's wrong for me as a congressman to dictate to women
... what decision they should make in the case of rape and
incest,'' said Pallone, who added he remains personally opposed to
abortion.
   The abortion provision would reverse a law in effect since 1981
that bans all Medicaid abortions for poor women except when the
mother's life is endangered by her pregnancy.
   Although the Senate has endorsed more liberal abortion
provisions, the House in previous years insisted on keeping the
current law. The House vote two weeks ago to accept the Senate
version surprised even its supporters.
   The disputed provision would allow Medicaid funding of abortions
in cases of rape or incest, when the victim ``reported promptly''
to health or law authorities.
   Although that was expected to cover a relatively narrow category
of women, the issue has taken on broader symbolic importance in the
political fight over abortion.
   It comes at a time when abortion rights supporters say they are
benefiting from a changed political climate after the Supreme Court
last summer gave the states more room to regulate abortions. That
ruling, they contend, has energized abortion rights supporters and
made voters more wary of efforts to impose new restrictions.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole today named W.
J. Usery Jr., a longtime mediator and onetime labor secretary
himself, as ``supermediator'' for the 6-month-old strike by the
United Mine Workers against Pittston Coal Group.
   ``I believe that Bill Usery is precisely the right person to
assist the parties in resolving what has, thus far, been a most
difficult dispute,'' Mrs. Dole told reporters in making the
announcement.
   Usery, who agreed Tuesday to try to settle the strike by 1,700
miners in three states, said the public acrimony between the union
and company gave him pause before he decided to accept.
   ``This is one that you didn't jump at so quick,'' Usery said.
Still, Usery said he would contact both sides immediately and that
he hoped to resolve the strike before the upcoming holidays. Usery
said he would meet separately with company and union officials
first but wanted them to agree to a face-to-face meeting soon.
   Usery, labor secretary in the Ford administration, has an
impressive record of settling strikes. Since leaving government, he
has headed a labor relations company in Washington.
   His skills will be tested in the UMW-Pittston dispute. The two
sides refuse to negotiate face-to-face and have been shuttling
messages through federal mediators.
   The strike began April 5 at Pittston mines in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky. The major dispute is over health and
retirement benefits.
   Two weeks ago, Mrs. Dole met with strikers in Carbo, Va., and
days later sat down with UMW President Richard Trumka and Pittston
Chairman Paul Douglas. After that meeting, she said she would name
a supermediator.
   As labor secretary, Usery sometimes stepped into contract
disputes but Mrs. Dole has resisted doing so.
   ``I am not a mediator,'' she said during her visit to the
Pittston facility. ``I'm not here to say I have the answer to this
complex problem. But I do feel now it is time to see if we can
facilitate the bargaining process.''
   Usery's resume includes helping end a six-month strike by the
United Auto Workers against Deere &amp; Co. in 1987 and a three-week
strike by Chicago teachers in 1983.
   He also helped settle a professional football strike in 1974 and
has mediated dozens of disputes in the rubber, auto, electric,
hotel and transportation industries.
   President Nixon brought the Hardwick, Ga., native to Washington
in 1969, naming him assistant secretary of labor. He was credited
with helping settle railroad and airline labor disputes.
   In 1973, he was named director of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, serving for three years until Ford tapped him
to head the Labor Department.

   A nine-block residential area was strewn
with smoldering debris today after a series of explosions destroyed
three homes, killing two people and injuring 13 others.
   ``It's like a war zone. There's a lot of damage,'' Conneaut
Mayor Lewis Shiley said after surveying the neighborhood.
   A dozen agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms were to search the rubble later today for clues of the
explosion, Shiley said. The mayor said it was presumed there were
no more deaths. Officials earlier feared more victims might be in
the wreckage.
   ``It's pretty much out. There's still some smoldering,'' Chet
Arcaro, Conneaut building inspector, said of the fire that broke
out after the series of explosions about noon Tuesday.
   Fire Chief Bim Orrenmaa said officials were investigating the
possibility that the 20 minutes of explosions, of which the largest
occurred midway through the series, may have been caused by illegal
fireworks.
   ``I thought it was an earthquake,'' said Lori Punkar, who lives
three blocks away in this town of 13,000 people just west of the
Pennsylvania state line.
   ``This felt like someone hit the house,'' she said. ``Like a
semi hit the house. All the neighbors ran out in the street saying,
`What was it?'''
   W.A. West said the blast rocked his house two miles away. ``We
were eating lunch and it shook the floor. I had no idea what it
was.''
   Orrenmaa said he saw what appeared to be firecrackers strewn
around the house where the largest explosion occurred.
Investigators had not yet determined whether all of the explosions
occurred at the same house.
   The fire chief said the pattern of the blasts led him to suspect
illegal fireworks were involved and he summoned federal agents to
investigate.
   John Kingsolver, a special agent with the federal bureau's
Cleveland office, also said items that resembled firecracker tubes
had been spotted at one house. He said federal investigators were
warned of the possibility of more blasts while they examine the
debris.
   The county coroner's office tentatively identified the two dead
as people who lived in the area of the blast: Donald A. Rossi, 56,
and June Riddle, described as elderly.
   The only injured person to be hospitalized, Georgianna Rossi,
46, was listed in satisfactory condition this morning at Hamot
Medical Center in Erie, Pa., about 25 miles east of Conneaut. She
lived in the house where the largest explosion occurred.
   Twelve people were treated at Brown Memorial Hospital in
Conneaut and released, said hospital administrator George Whitney.
   Orrenmaa originally put the death toll at three, but later
revised it to two.

   Eleven people were slightly injured Wednesday when
a boat bumped into Southwark Bridge in the River Thames near the
site of a fatal accident involving a pleasure boat in August,
police said.
   The Thames Line vessel collided with a buttress of the bridge
after apparently suffering a steering failure, police said. The
dented boat was taken out of service and the government's Marine
Accident Branch launched an investigation.
   Thames Line said later the accident was caused by an engine
fault leading to a loss of power.
   None of the 30 passengers on board was seriously injured, the
company said. One was taken to a hospital and treated for a bruised
knee, and 10 others suffered minor bruises.
   On Aug. 20, 51 people were killed when the Marchioness, a
pleasure boat chartered for an overnight birthday party, sank near
Southwark Bridge in central London after colliding with the
Bowbelle, a sand-and-gravel dredger.

<HEAD>Soviets Turn Away American Accused of Selling Secrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American facing charges of selling secrets to
the Soviet Union had applied for Soviet citizenship last month but
was denied, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
   Frank Nesbitt, who is accused of delivering unauthorized
information to Soviet agents, requested citizenship when he was in
Moscow as a tourist in September, said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yuri Gremitskikh.
   He was turned down because of ``suspicion of connections with
the criminal underworld,'' Gremitskikh said. He did not elaborate.
   Nesbitt, 44, a former military communications officer, was
arrested in a McLean, Va. hotel earlier this month and ordered held
without bail Oct. 19. A federal grand jury will hear the
government's case against him.
   The FBI says Nesbitt received $2,000 for classified
communications intelligence information he gave the Soviets during
his 10-day stay in Moscow, and was promised up to $100,000 more for
future work.
   Nesbitt's lawyer, Gregory English, said last week his client
intended no harm to the United States. He said Nesbitt passed on
only information he believed to be unclassified and had proposed to
the FBI that he become a double agent.
   English also said Nesbitt ``wanted to have some excitement in
his life.''

   The Senate today overwhelmingly passed a $3.45
billion relief package for earthquake-damaged Northern California
which substantially expands aid approved by the House.
   By a vote of 97-1, the Senate approved the plan and sent it back
to the House as part of a wide-ranging spending bill which must
reach President Bush's desk tonight to keep the federal government
from defaulting.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., cast the only negative vote. Not
voting were Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.
   The Senate accepted the House-passed $2.85 billion earthquake
allocation and, responding to pleas from California lawmakers,
added to it $600 million more for Small Business Administration
emergency loans.
   ``California will be eligible to receive immediately $3.45
billion,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. ``It is very likely
that the ultimate federal cost for the disaster may be higher...
for a community that has been badly shaken.''
   ``People who are dislocated from their homes and businesses need
that assistance now,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who called
the Senate action ``generous and sensitive.''
   ``You have to go for what you can and we've done that,'' said
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who led his delegation's unsuccessful
effort in the House for even more money _ $3.8 billion.
   The House measure, passed 321-99 on Tuesday, included $500
million for the SBA, $1.1 billion for Federal Emergency Management
Agency repair efforts and $1 billion for the Federal Highway
Administration's emergency fund. It also set up a $250 million fund
for Bush to spend at his discretion.
   In addition to expanding the SBA money, the Senate approved
waivers of federal rules, denied in the House bill, that would let
the state get more federal money quickly with less commitment of
local and state funds.
   Cranston estimated the total cost of the damage to the San
Francisco Bay area from the Oct. 17 earthquake exceeded $7 billion.
   Quick Senate action was needed because the aid was attached to a
stopgap spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown
Thursday. The bill is required because Congress and the president
have failed to enact 11 of the 13 annual appropriations bills
required for the government to operate in fiscal 1990, which began
Oct. 1.
   A top House leadership aide said he expected a modest expansion
in the Senate would be acceptable in that chamber. Both houses must
agree on a single version before it can be sent to the president.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday the
president could accept the House version of the assistance plan.
   The administration had proposed $1.5 billion in new federal
spending, plus earmarking another $1 billion for quake relief.
   Because of the urgency of the situation, the Californians said
they were seeking as much as they could get now, while the quake is
still fresh on the nation's consciousness, but would come back for
more later.
   ``Let me be honest,'' Fazio said. ``If we don't accomplish
everything we set out to accomplish, we'll have to come back again
and again and again ... (but) we understand that in six months
we'll be just another budgetary problem.''
   The allocation for the quake approved by the House was already
several times larger than any previous disaster aid package.
   Because of the extent of the damage, the Senate plan would waive
or greatly expand legal limits to the federal obligation.
   For example, one waiver would allow the federal government to
pay for repairing the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a vital
link that is a toll road and thus not eligible for such aid.
   The plan also would extend from 90 days to 180 days the period
during which the state could get 100 percent federal reimbursement
for road repairs. And the cost of earthquake repairs would be kept
separate from the state's normal allocation from the Highway Trust
Fund, so it would not slow road projects elsewhere in the state.

<HEAD>FEMA to Lower Flood Insurance Rates in Some Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency is
moving ahead with a program that will offer lower flood insurance
rates in communities that work harder to reduce risks of flood
damage, officials said Wednesday.
   Harold T. Duryee, head of FEMA's Federal Insurance
Administration, said the agency is setting a Dec. 15, 1990,
deadline for initial applications from communities seeking to
qualify for premium adjustments under the program, called the
Community Rating System.
   The first flood insurance rate cuts will take effect Oct. 1,
1991, in communities that qualify for them, he said.
   Duryee said the agency also is trying to simplify procedures
involved with the flood insurance program, noting criticism in some
communities that ``the program was so complex that people didn't
want to fuss with all that was necessary to get coverage.''
   Frank Reilly, the FIA's deputy administrator, said about 2,000
out of the nearly 18,000 communities now participating in the
National Flood Insurance Program will apply for premium reductions
under the new rating system.
   Currently, there are more than 2.1 million federal flood
insurance policies in force. Over the last 10 years, 350,000
insurance losses have been paid out for a total of $2.5 billion.
   An FIA summary of the Community Rating System said its goals are
to ``are to encourage, by the use of flood insurance premium
adjustments, community and state activities beyond those required
by the National Flood Insurance Program to reduce flood losses,
facilitate accurate insurance rating and promote the awareness of
flood insurance.''
   ``Not only does such a system properly reward those communities
that are doing more than the minimum to protect their residents
from flood losses, it will will encourage communities to initiate
new flood protection activities,'' the paper said.

<HEAD>Former Contra Says American Money Used To Buy Votes, Causes Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A disgruntled former Contra leader lashed out
Wednesday at U.S. financing for the opposition political coalition
in Nicaragua, charging the money is going for vote-buying and will
cause ``corruption on a big scale.''
   Edgar Chamorro, who describes himself as the CIA-selected
director of Contra communications from 1982 to 1984, said the $9
million in National Endowment for Democracy funds equals $2 billion
in his poor, Central American country.
   The Bush administration last week received congressional
approval for the aid to help the coalition in its February
electoral fight against the leftist Sandinista government.
   ``The congressional vote for this form of intervention
represents an essential agreement between the Bush administration
and the Democrat-controlled Congress that the attempt to overturn
the Sandinista government by armed force has failed,'' he said at a
news conference.
   Congress cut off military aid to the Contra rebels in 1988. The
10,000 or so troops, most of whom are based in Honduras, receive
non-lethal aid.
   Chamorro also charged that presidential candidate Violeta
Chamorro, who is not related to him, received the nomination
because of vote-buying.
   ``People received money to get her elected,'' he said. ``I have
heard this directly from friends and witnesses.'' He offered no
other proof or testimony.
   Chamorro also charged that opposition leaders planned to use
more than $2.5 million in American funds for salaries, cars and
paid vacations.
   ``These are merely the current, overt funds,'' Chamorro said.
   An Agency for International Development official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, said a draft budget had been presented
by the opposition coalition, but no decisions had been reached.
   ``It will be closely monitored,'' he said.
   Chamorro said the CIA still supplies the opposition working out
of Honduras and Costa Rica.
   He said Contra combatants continued ``carrying out armed
propaganda activities, murdering electoral officials and Sandinista
political activists and warning peasants against voting for the
Sandinistas.''
   Chamorro says he is a ``non-Sandinista Nicaraguan'' but faulted
the government only for not cracking down on the large sums of
money coming into the country for the elections, $2 million of
which goes to the government's electoral council.
   ``I think Nicaragua was wrong in accepting that money,'' he
said. ``This is corruption on a big scale.''
   Chamorro returned to live in Nicaragua in 1987 and he now heads
the Managua office of the Center for the Study of Democratic
Systems, a group he said will ``observe the observers'' in the
Nicaraguan elections. That organization is an offshoot of the New
York-based Institute for Media Analysis, made up mostly of
Americans opposed to the U.S. support for the Contra rebels.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Division Will Investigate Racism At Colorado High School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVERGREEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Civil Rights Division is
investigating incidents at a high school that prompted transfer
requests from a black teacher and three black students.
   Officials from the Civil Rights Division and other civil-rights
agencies plan to visit Evergreen High School next week, division
public information officer Judy Fester said Tuesday.
   Evergreen language arts teacher Joseph Knight submitted a
transfer request to the Jefferson County School District last
Friday after receiving an unsigned note containing a racist threat.
   The note ``was very physically threatening,'' Knight, 35, said
Tuesday. ``Life. Death. That sort of thing. ... I simply can't work
in fear, and I won't.''
   Knight is on paid administrative leave while his transfer
request is considered.
   Several weeks ago, three black students, the sons of Evergreen
residents Norm and Joan Burkett, withdrew from the school after
hearing that some students rigged a homecoming contest against them
because they are black. Their mother resigned as president of the
Parent Teachers Association.
   The students said that earlier racist graffiti and slurs against
blacks and Jews contributed to their decision to leave the school.
   Principal Byron Tucker said he believes the incidents are the
work of a handful of white supremacist students. He added that
there is growing anger among the school's 1,100 students, who
generally view publicity about the incidents as marring their
school's reputation.
   Parents in the mountain community west of Denver feel the same
way. ``I've been getting a lot of phone calls,'' said PTA President
Lynn Richardson. ``Parents are very upset and angry that Evergreen
is being labeled as racist.''
   Under Colorado's 1988 ethnic intimidation law, the note writer
could be charged with a misdemeanor. Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department spokesman Bob Deutsch said, however, that no police
report had been filed.

   Fifteen Japanese-Americans whose graduation
from high school was thwarted by World War II will receive diplomas
they earned 47 years ago.
   The students, who are scheduled to receive their diplomas
Saturday, were among those detained in the since-discredited
wartime policy of relocating Japanese-Americans to internment camps
as possible enemy sympathizers.
   ``Our rights were denied us all these years,'' said Hayao
Shishino, a retired cook who lives in Cerritos. ``We want to be on
the rolls of the Class of 1942.''
   Most of the high school seniors sent to internment camps went on
to receive diplomas from correspondence courses or at their 25th
anniversary class reunion in 1967. But Shishino and other former
students wanted diplomas dated 1942.
   He successfully appealed to Los Angeles school board member
Warren Furutani, whose mother-in-law was among the classmates
refused diplomas.
   ``The most important part of this episode is that it is a living
history lesson. We have an opportunity to go back and set the
record straight,'' Furutani said.
   Shishino helped set up the weekend ceremony, which 11 of the
former Los Angeles High School students are expected to attend. One
diploma will be awarded posthumously.

   A man has been found guilty of holding an
expensive saxophone for ransom.
   A state court jury deliberated about three hours Tuesday before
finding Rickie Lee Cleland guilty of stealing local musician Joe
Thompson's tenor saxophone, valued at $10,000 to $12,000, and
demanding money for its return.
   Cleland, 38, of Helena, could face up to 20 years in prison
after being convicted of felony theft and intimidation. Sentencing
was set for Nov. 30.
   Cleland was accused of stealing the saxophone on June 25 while
Thompson's band was storing equipment after playing at a wedding
reception.
   Prosecutors said Cleland called Thompson a few days later, said
he had found the horn and asked what Thompson would pay to have it
back.
   They said Cleland rejected Thompson's offer of $250 and said he
would give him a day to raise more money _ then asked for $1,500.
   Thompson alerted police, who connected a tape recorder to his
phone in time for a June 29 call from Cleland.
   During that call, according to the tape, Cleland increased his
demand to $2,000 but later settled on $500.
   Cleland was arrested a few minutes later when he met Thompson to
make the exchange.

<TEXT>
   Despite calls for less state regulation and more
power for schools to improve themselves, most states are still
calling the shots on education reform, according to a new report.
   States have made only modest educational gains since the 1983
federal report ``A Nation at Risk'' ushered in the reform era with
its verdict that U.S. schools were mired in mediocrity, according
to the report, ``The Progress of Reform: An Appraisal of State
Education Initiatives.''
   The report released Wednesday concluded that state reform
packages generally ``lacked coherence,'' and only a few states such
as Washington, Arkansas, Maine and Massachusetts have programs
aimed at encouraging local districts to find creative ways of
improving classroom instruction.
   Current rhetoric holds that the reform movement went through a
``first wave'' from 1982-86, mostly dictated from on high by
states, during which teacher and student standards were stiffened.
From 1986 on, a ``second wave'' of reform, often called
``restructuring,'' is said to have moved beyond standards to
improving teaching and learning at the school site.
   President Bush at his ``education summit'' with the nation's
governors last month put his stamp of approval on this ``second
wave,'' endorsing the principles of less educational red tape and
more power for teachers and others at school sites to meet reform
mandates.
   But the study concludes that this second wave of reform remains
wishful thinking in most states. Future objectives such as
redistributing education funds from rich to poor districts and
giving teachers and parents more authority will be far tougher, if
not impossible, to achieve.
   ``If we're going to get those kinds of things, people are going
to have to be willing to stay at it for a long time,'' William A.
Firestone, associate professor of education at Rutgers University
and co-author of the report said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   A few pioneering districts such as Rochester, N.Y., and Dade
County, Fla., have active local restructuring strategies, but
``states are still enacting policies more characteristie globe that you
will also be known as
the international education president.''

   Japan has signed an agreement to allow Poland to
extend its debt repayment schedule for about $396.5 million in
loans, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the agreement followed negotiations in Warsaw under arrangements
made by Poland's creditor nations, known as the Paris Club, in late
1987.
   He said Poland's debts to Japan, which had been due Dec. 31,
1988, included $336.6 million of export insurance paid by Japan to
cover Poland's failure to pay for its imports and $59.9 million in
loans extended by the Japan Export-Import Bank.
   Under an agreement, Poland will repay the debts and interest
over five years after a five-year grace period, the official said.

   A stamp fraud ring that has cost the post office
$16 million may have been broken in a series of raids Wednesday,
investigators said.
   The alleged fraud involved the resale of canceled stamps after
the postmark had been removed chemically and the stamps re-gummed,
said a post office spokesman.
   Several people were being questioned following raids across
Britain by police and 75 postal investigators, the spokesman said.
   Billions of stamps were reportedly seized, many of which had
been sent unwittingly to the fraud ring by charities, the spokesman
said.
   The charities believed they were sending the stamps to dealers
who repackage them for sale to collectors, the spokesman said.
   The post office said it was alerted to a possible fraud a year
ago when revenue from stamps didn't tally with the volume of mail.
   The alleged plot involved outsiders, not post office employees,
the spokesman said.

   President Bush declared today that Nicaragua
poses ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States'' and announced he
will continue the U.S. embargo against the Central American country.
   The trade embargo against the nation of 3 million was imposed by
President Reagan on May 1, 1985. It bars imports from Nicaragua and
bans U.S. exports to that country except to support the Contra
rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. It also
prohibits Nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the United
States.
   In related developments, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said the United States protested as recently as today to the Soviet
Union about continued shipments of East-bloc arms from Nicaragua to
leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Baker, briefing reporters on Bush's upcoming trip to Costa Rica,
also said the president would not meet with Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega this weekend during a celebration of a century of
democracy in Costa Rica.
   ``I doubt that he would refuse to speak if spoken to, but he's
not going to be meeting with him, and not going to be extending any
courtesies,'' said Baker.
   He also said Bush was likely to use the gathering in Costa Rica,
to be attended by 19 heads of state, to further ``keep up the
pressure'' for the ouster of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
from power and to talk about the war on drugs.
   The secretary said the administration continues to have concern
that in the upcoming Nicaraguan elections, ``the opposition parties
there will not be given adequate and sufficient access to the media
to make the election free and fair.''
   ``Nicaragua clearly continues to ship arms'' to leftist rebels
in El Salvador, Baker said, citing ``the fact that a truck was
stopped here at the Hunduran border a day or so ago that had
East-bloc arms in it.''
   ``It is a major problem that we have called to the attention of
the Soviet Union, and called to their attention as recently as
today,'' Baker said.
   The Soviet Union has denied any role in such arms shipments.
   ``We've had an extended dialogue with the Soviet Union about the
importance of using their influence to stop that kind of
activity,'' Baker added. ``The Soviets told us they are going to
use their best efforts to do that.''
   Baker said he was willing to give the Soviets the benefit of the
doubt, since Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had
recently been in Nicaragua. ``It would appear to me the Nicaraguans
are telling them one thing and doing something else,'' he said.
   Baker said a prerequisite for such a meeting was for Ortega to
first meet with ``the Nicaraguan resistance,'' the contras who have
been supported by both the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   ``We think he ought to meet with his own people before he meets
with us,'' Baker said. ``He has continued to refuse to do that.''
   Bush, in a six-month report to Congress on the status of the
Nicaragua embargo, said ``the trade sanctions are an essential
element of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in Nicaragua
by diplomatic means.''
   The Bush administration wants to see Ortega's government voted
out of office in the election next Feb. 25, and contends that
election preparations unfairly benefit the ruling Sandinistas.
   ``The policies and actions of the government of Nicaragua
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States,'' Bush
said.
   ``I do not believe that current conditions in Nicaragua justify
lifting the trade sanctions,'' he wrote. He added that if Ortega
holds fair elections and implements democratic reforms, as he
promised in a regional agreement with other Central American
presidents, ``the emergency that prompted the imposition of the
trade sanctions would largely be resolved.''

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers from North Korea and South
Korea set aside their agenda Wednesday and traded accusations of
dictatorship and human rights abuses, casting doubt on any quick
breakthrough toward easing tension.
   Delegates from the two sides clashed when communist North Korea
opened the talks at this truce village by demanding South Korea
release three jailed dissidents and get all U.S. troops to withdraw.
   Chief South Korean delegate Chai Mun-shick responded by saying
North Korea should stop interfering in the south's internal affairs
and said the Pyongyang government ``must abandon dictatorial rule
and protect human rights.''
   The senior North Korean delegate, Chun Kum Chol, reacted
angrily: ``Your accusations are nonsense.''
   After reading prepared statements repeating their uncompromising
stands, both sides traded unusually hostile accusations for more
than three hours, but agreed to meet again Nov. 29.
   Wednesday's meeting, the first since December, was called to set
terms for a joint session of the two Koreas' legislatures to work
out various tension-easing measures on the peninsula, including a
non-aggression pact.
   The nations clashed over similar subjects at Red Cross, sports
and other talks earlier this month but their exchanges were not as
hostile as Wednesday.
   The chief North Korean delegate, Chun, argued that the three
jailed South Korean dissidents _ Christian pastor Moon Ik-hwan,
opposition lawmaker Suh Kyung-won and radical student Im Su-kyong _
were ``patriots who wanted reunification of the divided peninsula''
and demanded their immediate release.
   The three dissidents were arrested between April and August for
making illegal trips to North Korea, an enemy country.
   The Seoul government bans unauthorized visits to North Korea and
maintains dialogue on national unification must be carried on only
through official channels. The two Koreas do not allow their
citizens to visit each other or cross the heavily guarded border.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and
the capitalist south in 1945 at the end of World War II and the two
nations remain bitter enemies after fighting a bloody war from
1950-53.

   Recovery advanced into its second week
today for an earthquake-rattled region feeling an aftershock of
numbers _ a stronger Richter reading, a 50-50 chance of a new jolt
and an infusion of relief money.
   Eight people remained missing, and the death toll from the Oct.
17 temblor climbed to 63 with a coroner's discovery of a 39th
victim from double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland.
   The state Office of Emergency Services reported today that
13,892 people have been left homeless, nearly double the previous
figure.
   The first damage claim against the state was filed by two
motorists injured in the collapse.
   The Senate today approved a $3.45 billion quake relief package.
It expands a $2.85 billion House-approved measure by adding $600
million for Small Business Administration emergency loans. The
legislation now goes back to the House.
   Damage estimates have been set at $7.1 billion, making it the
costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.
   ``We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive power of World
War II, including the atomic bomb,'' said U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
who represents San Francisco's hard-hit Marina district.
   Santa Cruz County got a $356,460 check from state Controller
Gray Davis on Tuesday. The check is 75 percent of the money the
county already has spent on earthquake response.
   Church bells tolled at 5:04 p.m., one week to the minute after
the quake. It packed more punch than first thought, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey, which upped the magnitude to 7.1 from
6.9 on the Richter scale after checking 18 seismic stations around
the world.
   The homeless figure climbed after rain forced many into
shelters, where county officials are compiling counts of those
displaced, according to OES spokeswoman Nancy Sutton.
   A geologist warned that because of the recent rain, huge
sections of land in Santa Cruz County cracked by earthquake
fissures are in danger of sliding this winter and burying hundreds
of homes.
   ``What's happening today is frightening to geologists who have
looked at it,'' Professor Gary Griggs of the University of
California, Santa Cruz, told county supervisors Tuesday. ``I think
there's a cause for alarm, but not instant alarm until we've had
more rain.''
   Jumpy residents also were told that there is a 50-50 chance of a
5.0 aftershock during the next two months, and there is an 11
percent shot of a 6.0 shock. A 5.0 Richter reading can cause
considerable damage; 6.0 can be severe, especially to buildings
already weakened.
   An aftershock of 4.5 was registered at 6:27 p.m. Tuesday, the
latest of about 3,500 aftershocks since Oct. 17.
   ``I'm still shook up. Every time I hear a noise I jump,'' said
Ela Mae Douglas, owner of a soul food cafe near I-880.
   And for all the death and destruction, Elizabeth Patrice Cupples
celebrated her first week of life. She was born at 5:03 p.m. on
Oct. 17 by Ceasarean section, and doctors shielded her mother by
leaning over the incision.
   ``You were born and the earth moved,'' said her father, James,
who was at his wife's side in the delivery room of Santa Cruz
Community Hospital.
   In Oakland, crews were taking down sections of I-880. They fear
that still-standing sections of the state's first elevated freeway
could topple like dominoes onto the 1\-mile stretch that crumpled.
   Four sections remain inaccessible, and the search for more
bodies was delayed until at least Thursday because the road is too
shaky. Authorities have abandoned hope of finding anyone alive in
the rubble.
   Oakland police, who had said Tuesday that nine people remained
unaccounted for, revised the number to eight today but could give
no explanation for the change.
   Officials said 135 people evacuated from homes near the highway
Sunday may be allowed to return to their homes by Thursday.
   In the damage claims, which could lead to a lawsuit, Hayward
residents Milton Wade Jr. and Askia Y.M. Hurts, who were returning
from a plumbing job in Wade's car on the freeway, asked the state
to pay unspecified medical damages.
   Workers, meanwhile, removed the section of the lower deck of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge on Tuesday. It will take at least
a month to rebuild the five-lane, 50-foot pieces. The hole in the
53-year-old bridge is as gaping as the hole in the area's
transportation system.
   Without the bridge and key sections of devastated highways,
transit officials have jury-rigged a jammed commuter system with
extra trains, ferries and other alternatives.
   Inconvenienced commuters abandoned their cars and took to public
transportation in record numbers. The Bay Area Rapid Transit by 9
a.m. Tuesday set a weekday ridership record with 99,135, 4,300 more
than the previous day.
   Meanwhile, 300 men found shelter and plentiful chow on a Navy
vessel built to deploy assault troops by helicopter. Most of the
men, part of the city's permanent homeless population, were staying
at the Moscone Convention Center but were shipped to the USS
Peleliu to make room a convention of plastic surgeons.
   ``We're getting steaks, roast beef, ham end eggs, vegetables and
snacks all day _ and regular showers _ the Navy's doin' a good
job,'' declared John Clulow on the carrier's cavernous hangar deck.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos called on the federal government
to raise the maximum home rebuilding loan to $500,000 from $100,000
because of the high housing costs in the region.
   ``One-hundred thousand dollars in South Carolina can make a big
difference. It doesn't here,'' Agnos said.
   In San Francisco alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive
repair, Agnos said. Damage in the city could reach $3.2 billion, he
said.
   Clyde Walthall, spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, said the
utility may have to replace about 10 miles of gas distribution
lines in the hard-hit Marina district. The cost: $10 million.
   About 5,100 customers are without gas service in the district,
and about 1,000 customers are also without electricity, Walthall
said.

felony drug case, but the judge withheld ordering his arrest until
Thursday.
   Grammer, allegedly found in possion of a quarter-gram of cocaine
during a routine April traffic stop, was expected to ask for
permission to attend a drug abuse diversion program for first
offenders.
   The actor's lawyer, Robert L. Diamond, assured Municipal Judge
Aviva K. Bobb that Grammer would obey the order to appear Thursday.
The lawyer said a communication mixup was to blame for Grammer's

   Grammer, 34, faces one felony count of possession of cocaine.
   His participation in the drug-abuse program could lead to his

<HEAD>Baker Offers to Review Proposal for Israeli-Palestinian Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 7 grafs new with Baker comments; picks up 3rd graf pvs,
Arens told. Editing to shorten.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III offered
today to review his proposal for talks between Israel and
Palestinian Arabs but said overhauling it could delay negotiations.
   ``We think the five points are reasonable. We think the five
points are clear,'' Baker told a White House news conference,
referring to the major provisions of the U.S. proposal.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, in a letter to Baker
delivered Monday night, accepted the U.S. package in principle _
provided his government was assured the Palestine Liberation
Organization would be excluded and that the talks would deal
entirely with holding elections on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   ``I think that we want to do everything we can to try and move
things forward,'' Baker said. ``And therefore we will review the
suggested changes we have received.''
   However, he added, ``if we start making changes for one side we
will find ourselves in an extended negotiating session in terms of
making changes that might be requested. ... It would be much better
if both sides would accept the five points as a general framework
for moving forward and then let's get about the hard, nitty-gritty
business of sitting down face-to-face and deciding what the rules
are that would govern the conduct of elections.''
   Baker described his mood as realistic _ neither optimisic nor
pessimistic _ after reading Arens letter and talking to him Tuesday
on the telephone.
   But he went on to say: ``Over the last week or so many people
have wanted to, basically, write this effort off. They wanted to
declare it dead. The events of the last two or three days at least
indicate that the effort has life in it.''
   Arens told Baker in the letter delivered by Israeli Ambassador
Moshe Arad on Monday night that the PLO must be excluded and the
agenda limited to the mechanics of conducting elections among the
1.4 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Baker had already offered assurances he was not trying to
pressure Israel into dealing with the PLO and that Israel would
have the right to determine beforehand if it was ``satisfied'' with
the Palestinian delegation.
   Arens asked Baker to harden those assurances, while Baker is
trying to persuade the PLO through Egyptian intermediaries to
permit Palestinians in the Israeli-held territories to engage in
negotiations with Israel.
   Without a green light from Yasser Arafat's organization, it is
extremely unlikely Palestinians will step forward. Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in a letter last week to Baker, said they
were being subjected to ``intimidation.''
   The PLO's Central Committee, meeting last week in Baghdad, Iraq,
insisted that only the PLO had the authority to represent
Palestinians and to select the delegation. But Margaret Tutwiler,
the State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday that did not mean
the PLO had rejected Baker's initiative.
   Baker talked again to Arens on Tuesday, reaching him by
telephone in Brussels where the Israeli foreign minister is meeting
with Belgian and European Common Market officials as well as with a
group of Israeli ambassadors based in Europe.
   The contents of their conversation were not disclosed. But it
was learned Baker and Arens concluded they had a basis to keep
working together toward Shamir's goal of holding elections among
the Palestinians.
   Arens, in an interview broadcast today on Israel Radio, said,
however, he was ``adamant'' that the formula for talks with
Palestinians not deviate in any way from the Israeli government's
peace initiative.
   Baker also talked by telephone with Egyptian Foreign Minister
Esmat Abdel Meguid, who was in Cairo.
   Publicly, the State Department welcomed Arens' letter to Baker
and said through Ms. Tutwiler it ``reinforces what we believe _
that they are engaged and that they are working really hard to try
to bridge these gaps.''
   Shamir, while touring the Golan Heights, meanwhile, described
the recently stepped-up exchange with the Bush administration as
positive. ``I don't see any large gap between our views and the
proposals of the secretary of state,'' he told reporters. ``But
there are some differences.''
   Israel's Labor Party opposition stressed those differences. ``I
don't see anything in Baker's proposal that needs to be changed,''
said Shimon Peres, the Labor leader who is also finance minister.
   Shamir said Israel would agree to the Baker plan ``after the
changes we proposed are accepted.'' The prime minister added: ``In
a few days we will know if there is an agreement or not.''
   Only one of Baker's five points has been publicly acknowledged
by the State Department. It provides for a three-way meeting of
Israel, Egypt and the United States in Washington after Israel
meets with Palestinians but before the elections are held.
   The other provisions are that the Israeli-Palestinian talks be
held, that the elections are the focus, that Israel is to be
``satisfied'' with the Palestinian delegation's composition and
that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is free to consult any Middle
Eastern parties about the makeup of the delegation.
   Shamir's proposal is that Palestinians elected on the West Bank
and in Gaza would make arrangements with Israel for five years of
limited self-rule. After this trial run, Palestinians together with
Jordan and Egypt, would negotiate an overall settlement with Israel.

   Crews began searching with heavy
equipment today to clear tons of twisted, blackened rubble at a
plastics plant, where a series of explosions and fire may have
killed up to 22 workers, officials said.
   The body of third plant worker was recovered today, officials
said.
   In addition, a worker who had been among the missing was
accounted for, said Bob Benz, manager of the Pasadena plant. That
reduced the number of presumed dead to 19, not counting the three
workers whose bodies were found but not yet identified.
   The worker accounted for today was not at the plant during the
Monday afternoon explosion, Benz said.
   ``They have moved in equipment overnight and they are beginning
the process of searching for the missing,'' said Dick Robinson,
Phillips' director of community affairs. ``It's liable to be a slow
process, but they are working in that area now and we'll take
whatever time it takes to find them.''
   Robinson indicated it was unlikely that anyone in the debris is
still alive.
   ``We always hope for the best but...'' he trailed off.
   Miles of charred strings of pipe from Monday's accident were
piled haphazardly around the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant. Some
buildings are gone, and eight giant reactors now look like huge,
smashed tin cans.
   ``Any employee in that wreckage probably didn't survive,'' said
Jere Smith, Phillips' director of public relations, looking at the
scene.
   Officials at the company's Bartlesville, Okla., headquarters
late Tuesday released a list of missing Phillips employees.
   The plant's emergency alarm system had been tested and was
problem-free hours before the explosions, said Greg Derrick, a
Phillips spokesman in Bartlesville.
   Smith said officials were mobilizing heavy cranes and bulldozers
to remove the wreckage. The effort would proceed slowly as crews
look for victims while removing debris, he said.
   ``The devastation in the plant is a whole lot more extensive
than we thought,'' said Harris County Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen.
``Some of the buildings are gone. There's nothing there. Others are
crushed in, flattened.''
   Frantic relatives gathered and scanned lists of known survivors.
Many held a vigil outside the complex, which produces 4.5 million
pounds a day of plastics used in milk jugs and grocery sacks.
   Mary De La Vergne, 38, found the name of her common-law husband,
Cipriana Rodriguez, 43, on the list of missing workers.
   ``I had just taken him lunch,'' said Ms. De La Vergne, dressed
in black. ``I heard the explosion when I was going back home.''
   ``I can only keep on hoping,'' she said, collapsing into tears.
   Of the 124 injured in the blast, 35 remained hospitalized
Tuesday, with as many as six people in critical condition. Robinson
said doctors would be reporting to Phillips officials later today
with updates on the employees' conditions.
   Officials don't know yet exactly what caused the explosions,
which stemmed from a leaking chemical reactor. At least two
government agencies have joined Phillips in assessing the damage.
   ``We're going to do a thorough investigation _ not only in
procedures, not only in systems, but in training the employees had
to assure ourselves that every precaution was taken,'' said Gilbert
Saulter, regional administrator for the Occupation Safety and
Health Administration.
   Union officials say they are questioning work schedules that may
have left less experienced or tired employees on the job.
   ``We feel like the number of hours that have been put in,
particularly by some maintenance classifications, and the
contractors _ the number of them that are in there working and the
lack of training on their part _ it is a safety measure'' that may
have contributed to the blast, said W.T. Walker, representative of
the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union Local 4-227.
   Worker James Westerfield, 37, said he saw a ``red fireball ...
eating up everything in sight.'' He began running out, but stopped
to carry an injured co-worker, Gary Bogle.
   Westerfield shrugged as he looked at smoke rising from the plant
on Tuesday, and said he deserved no special mention.
   ``There ain't no heroes out here,'' he said. ``It was just
everybody trying to help everybody else.''
   The plant exploded in a series of blasts Monday afternoon,
sending metal and concrete debris flying as far as six miles. The
blast bent nearby railroad warning signs. Twenty-five miles away,
the ground shook.
   Authorities said it will be days and perhaps weeks before the
missing workers are found.
   The second victim was found Tuesday, but the body could not
immediately be recovered because it was partly buried in mounds of
concrete and steel beams. The first fatality was discovered Monday
night, but officials have not yet identified either person.
   The area where authorities believe most of the missing workers
are entombed is a twisted jumble of rubble and debris.
   ``It's going to take extremely heavy equipment to remove the
debris. ... We're going to have to bring in a bulldozer to make a
road,'' the sheriff said. Smith said Phillips likely will rebuild
at the site, but added he was uncertain what type of facility would
replace it.
   Workers whose jobs were displaced by the explosion will continue
to be paid, he said, but some may be laid off later. Phillips also
will try to find work for some of the workers at the company's
other operations in nearby Houston and Sweeny.
   More than 900 people worked in three shifts at the plant, built
in 1948 on an 800-acre complex.

<HEAD>Woman Turns In Son On Bank Charge To Keep Him From Worse Trouble</HEAD>

   A woman says she turned her son over to
the FBI to face a bank robbery charge so he wouldn't get into more
trouble.
   ``I'd rather see him in prison for a few years than see him
dead. That's why I turned him in. I thought I was doing the right
thing,'' Carolyn Hayes of Hattiesburg said Tuesday during a bond
hearing for her son, Gregory Molette.
   U.S. Magistrate John R. Countiss III noted that Molette had
convictions in 1983 and 1984 for sale of marijuana and ordered him
held without bond until his trial Jan. 8.
   ``He's a danger to the community because of his drug habits and
propensity for the sale of drugs,'' Countiss said.
   Hayes, 46, said her son ``didn't have any money. He would have
gone and stole and gotten in some deeper trouble.''
   Molette was indicted Oct. 6 in connection with the Sept. 5
holdup of a Unifirst Bank for Savings branch in Jackson.
Authorities said $3,910 was taken.
   ``He called me and asked for money and I told him I didn't have
it, which I didn't. I'm a widow lady,'' Hayes said.
   ``I told him I knew what he had done because I had seen it on
the TV myself,'' Hayes said. Local television stations showed a
photo taken by a bank surveillance camera.
   Molette, 24, took a bus to Michigan after he saw his picture on
television, FBI Agent Willie Covington said. FBI agents arrested
him Sept. 12 at a relative's home in Saginaw, Mich.

   Sleek, powerful sports cars and
imaginative high-tech wizardry highlight the 28th Tokyo Motor Show,
which opens for a 12-day run Friday.
   Japan's 11 automakers are joined by manufacturers from 15
countries, including South Korea and the Soviet Union, showing off
gadgetry ranging from fingerprint-recognition to built-in personal
computers and fax machines.
   Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Isuzu and Subaru all have new
or prototype sports cars reflecting the trend toward bigger, more
powerful engines.
   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, is showing off its 4500GT
concept car, a sleek sports car with a 4.5-liter powerhouse engine
churning out 300 horsepower. Concept cars are often built to give
engineers an idea how it will look and perform. Modificiations,
sometimes major, may be made if the car goes into production.
   ``I see more diversification into many varieties of sports
cars,'' said Toyota product planning engineer Masataka Esaki.
``Large, small, for winding roads, highway cruising, off-road
driving.''
   Depending on the response, concept cars displayed at the Tokyo
show could become production models.
   Honda has its $56,000 NSX, an aluminum-bodied, Ferrari-like
speedster to be released in Japan and the United States next year.
   Mazda is rolling out its Eunos Roadster, called the MX-5 Miata
overseas, which has proven itself as the hottest sports car of the
year. Introduced in September, it has already sold out its entire
U.S. stock. The gull-wing TD-R concept sports car, with its
1.6-liter turbo engine, is designed especially for off-road driving.
   Mitsubishi's concept sports car is the 3-liter HSX, which is so
aerodynamic-conscious it has hidden air spoilers that extend or
lift when the car hits certain speeds or curves.
   Isuzu is showing off its conceptual ``Super Midship'' 4200R, a
flat racer-like four-seater packed with digital dials and a pop-up
TV screen for navigation.
   To top off the sports car lineup is Subaru's Caspita, jointly
developed with the unlikely partner Wacoal, Japan's major women's
underwear manufacturer. The 3.5-liter, 12-cylinder Caspita will
carry a supercharged price tag of at least $357,000, a Subaru
official said.
   Ferrari, Porsche, Lotus, Jaguar and other foreign autmomakers
also displayed new sports cars and prototypes they unveiled
previously.
   Nissan's Neo-X is an ``intelligent'' car with holographic
displays, laser radar systems and electronic tire pressure sensors.
The station wagon-like Boga has a fingerprint-recognition device
for unlocking the driver's door that can recognize up to 10
different fingerprints.
   Nissan's futuristic Primera-X has a rear TV camera that projects
images onto the rearview mirror for backing up and a highly
accurate navigation system that displays street maps on a
television screen.
   Japan's No. 2 automaker also unveiled its hatchback NX-Coupe,
primarily for export to the United States from next year, the
phaeton-like Figaro, a so-called ``retro'' two-seater whose design
harks back to the 1950s but which is equipped with a turbocharged
1-liter engine, and the Chapeau, a futuristic-looking cargo vehicle.
   Mazda is also showing that it is expanding into the
micro-minicar market, including one in a snappy gull-wing version.
   Mitsubishi is bringing out its prototype RVR, a Jeep-like
beachmobile of the future.
   Some vans on display show sophisticated technological
innovation. Mazda's MPV Executive is an office on wheels, with a
personal computer, facsimile machine and built-in VHS video deck
suspended from the ceiling.
   Nissan's Caravan has a stacked component audio system and a fax
machine for receiving photos of the Earth from a weather satellite.
``Executives want to know about the weather when it comes to
playing golf,'' a Nissan official said.

   An earthquake-flattened freeway is within

crack-infested, crime-ridden, low-income housing project.
   And as the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders trickled back to
class this week, they were encouragd to talk about their personal
fears to help soothe any psychological jolts left over from the
quake.
   ``I thought I was going to die. At first I thought it was the
washing machine. Then we heard plates falling,'' said Jamaal Brown,
10.
   ``I saw cars crushed on the freeway and the bodies were in
there. It's bad,'' said one fourth-grader, sitting cross-legged in
a circle of children sharing his feelings with a group.
   ``My grandmother had a heart attack,'' said another.
   ``My fish tank broke and all the fish died,'' one added.
   ``I tried to run but I couldn't. I had to crawl,'' a student
said.
   Psychologists throughout Northern California have encouraged
schools to help children cope with the disruptions of the Oct. 17
earthquake. Warning signs of anxiety are trouble sleeping, clinging
to parents or being excessively quiet.
   ``Children experience an earthquake differently,'' said Shirley
Reece, chief social worker for child psycholology at Langley Porter
Psychiatric Hospital of the University of California at San
Francisco.
   ``They feel terribly powerless. And if they see it in the papers
or on TV, the earthquake happens over and over. They are simply
being retraumatized,'' she said.
   At the Cole School, which is decorated for Halloween, students
talked, drew pictures and wrote quake-related poems. The building
is one block away from Interstate 880 and four blocks from a
section of the elevated roadway that collapsed, killing dozens of
people.
   There were special feelings about the plight of 6-year-old Julio
Berumen, who was trapped in the carnage. Firefighters had to cut
through his dead mother's body with a chain saw so doctors could
amputate his right leg and free him.
   ``They shouldn't have put that on the news about that boy. That
was terrible. That was personal,'' said Toral George, 10.
   Edson Mejia, a sixth-grader, drew a picture in crayon of the
double-decked roadway. It showed columns cracking in half, cars
sandwiched between layers of concrete and passengers in cars.
   ``I felt sorry for the people stuck in there,'' said Mejia. ``It
sounded like a bomb.''
   About 135 people from the neighborhood were evacuated because
officials feared still-standing portions of the shaky roadway could
fall. Some students require passes from police to pass under the
road, visible as the students jumped double-dutch rope and played
basketball at recess.
   ``Every time they look at the freeway, they're reminded of it.
They're reminded there are still bodies out there,'' said
sixth-grade teacher Claudia Bilbao.
   There are other reminders. Near the cafeteria, a seismometer was
installed by Columbia University to measure aftershocks. Teachers
also used the device for their science classes.
   One tangible fear was aftershocks and reports that the quake
that hit, as devastating as it was, wasn't even the Big One that
scientists fear.
   ``There's going to be another one. It's going to be so big, the
ground will open up and we'll all fall in a hole,'' said Spirit
Williams, 11.
   ``Nobody sleeps. There's going to be another in the middle of
the night,'' said Shamezo Lunukanea, 10.
   ``My mother said she's going pack all her clothes and move to
Mississippi,'' said Tenysha Foster, 10.
   Faye McHellen, a fourth-grade teacher, tried to calm fears with
a group discussion.
   ``It was a natural catastrophe. If you and your family were
scared, it was perfectly understandable. We had no control over
it,'' she told students soothingly.
   She asked students to write a vertical poem, in which the first
letters of the lines spell earthquake, about their experience,
including this one from Akpanabio Lumukanda:
   ``Everyone frightened.
   ``All suffering.
   ``Rocking and cracking.
   ``Taking care of their children.
   ``Home destroyed.
   ``Quaking house.
   ``Under the freeway.
   ``Allowing people to go to the Red Cross.
   ``Kind people helped homeless children.
   ``Earthquakes are scary.''

<HEAD>Gov't Unable to Buy Bumper Grain Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local governments that urged peasants to grow
more grain are too short of cash to buy the bumper harvest, leaving
angry peasants with grain they can't sell or store, an official
report said Wednesday.
   Ever since spring planting time, Chinese leaders have been
urging peasants to ``grasp grain production'' and plant grain
rather than more profitable crops in order to help China become
self-sufficient in grain.
   Many peasants did, and now they are mad, the Peasants' Daily
said.
   This year's crop is estimated to top 400 million tons, making it
the highest since 1984. But because of the government's year-old
economic austerity program, which has sharply cut bank credit, many
county grain bureaus have no cash to buy the crop.
   What they do buy, they can't sell because regional grain bureaus
_ the next step in the state purchase system _ also have no money,
the paper said.
   County grain storage facilities are overflowing, it said, and in
one county in central China 100,000 tons are being stored in the
open and face danger of turning moldy. In another county, peasants
have been stuck with more than 100,000 tons in their homes.
   The state's inability to buy the crop has depressed free market
prices, and in central China's Henan province some peasants have
sold grain at fire-sale prices to itinerate profiteers to get it
off their hands, the paper said.
   All peasants contract with the state to sell a fixed amount of
grain, but they can sell the rest on the free market. In past
years, free market prices were higher than state prices and in some
areas local governments had trouble keeping peasants from selling
their entire crops on the free market.
   The government fears that if all grain were bought and sold on
free markets, the price would rise and trigger unrest in cities
where residents are used to low state-subsidized prices.
   The paper noted the irony of the situation.
   ``Two months earlier, large numbers of officials rode in
propaganda buses through the villages, mobilizing peasants to sell
more grain to the state this year,'' it wrote. ``Two months later,
when the peasants carried their extra grain to the grain shop, the
grain shops one after another were closed. ... The peasants
furiously (asked), `Isn't this making fun of us field hands?'''
   County governments dealt with a similar shortage of funds last
year by issuing IOUs, but that triggered protests and violent
clashes in some places. This year, the government pledged to pay
cash, so that not taking the grain at all has become its only
option.
   The government has compounded its headache by recreating a state
monopoly on buying cotton this year to keep a shortage of cotton
from driving prices up. The move means local governments must come
up with even more funds than before.
   The official China Daily said last week that the central bank
was distributing $5 billion in emergency funds to local banks to
help buy the harvest. The Peasants' Daily did not say if this sum
would be enough.
   It called the problem one of ``circulation'' and urged
``responsible departments to think of solutions as soon as
possible.''

<HEAD>Official Probe Into Swiss Ambassador's Conduct In Bonn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry said Wednesday it
is investigating reports that its ambassador to Bonn insulted a
group of West German officials during an evening of heavy drinking.
   The envoy, Albert Hohl, said he spent a ``boisterous evening''
with city officials from Bonn and from Basel, Switzerland, on a
Rhine River cruise boat.
   He said that in joking about Swiss relations with the big
neighbor to the north, he mentioned an anti-German epithet. The
West Germans did not take offense but the Basel delegation later
complained to the Foreign Ministry, Hohl told The Associated Press.
   He dismissed a report Wednesday by a Basel magazine, Dementi,
that he insulted the German group and had to be dragged from the
boat drunk.
   Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Clemens Birrer said an internal
inquiry was launched against Hohl after the Sept. 23 incident, in
which the ambassador was ``under a certain degree of alcohol
influence.'' Hohl has been asked to respond officially to the
allegations of poor conduct, the spokesman said.
   While official relations between the two countries are good,
opinion polls traditionally show that West Germans are not very
popular in Switzerland.

<HEAD>Simpson Says Democratic `Yapping Dogs' Out to Get Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans, stung by a drive by
Democrats to portray President Bush as timid, hesitant and weak,
described the critics Wednesday as ``yapping dogs'' determined to
``rule or ruin.''
   ``They're not interested in legislating,'' said Deputy
Republican Leader Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. ``They're just interested in
seeing just who can ram it to the other side.''
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, replying to a remark
by Bush on Tuesday that he was tired of ``taking hits'' from
opponents, said the president has no reason to complain.
   The president doesn't mind criticizing others, but doesn't want
to be criticized himself, the Maine Democrat said.
   He said criticism of the adequacy of the president's proposals
for Poland and Hungary was entirely justified because ``what the
president proposed was inadequate.''
   Mitchell, House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., and most other
Democratic leaders have opened an aggressive campaign in recent
weeks, repeatedly using such words as ``weak,'' and ``timid,'' and
``woefully inadequate'' to describe Bush's efforts on such issues
as aid for Eastern Europe and the war against drugs.
   On Tuesday, Mitchell ripped into Bush's drive to pass a capital
gains tax cut, accusing the administration of unfair tactics and
declaring: ``The capital gains tax has become the Holy Grail of
this administration.''
   Mitchell said the administration ``has cast aside any concern
for the deficit. It has cast aside any concern for the budget
process, it has now cast aside any concern for fairness and it has
cast aside any concern for relations with this Congress'' on the
capital gains issue.
   Simpson told the Senate that in making such statements, Mitchell
and Foley are reflecting ``heat from down below.''
   ``It's heat from people who really don't like to legislate; they
just like to rule or ruin,'' Simpson said.
   He said these ``young Turk'' Democrats were irritated with the
early tendency of both Mitchell and Foley to accomodate the
president and facilitate his programs.
   ``They have been saying, ``When are you going to stop that? When
are you going to hammer him? ``Get him. Forget the issues. Just get
him.'''
   Simpson said he is not blaming Mitchell or Foley but is
reserving his fire for those Democrats whom he said insisted on a
more aggressive strategy.
   ``I think they grind their teeth at night,'' Simpson said,
adding:
   ``They're not interested in legislating. They are just
interested in seeing just who can ram it to the other side. Out of
ambition ... They have a higher agenda and that's power ... And
Heaven forbid, some of them even lust for the presidency.''
   ``And so they rattle the cage,'' Simpson said.
   ``And they say things like, `the hesitancy presidency,' which is
a dazzling phrase somebody cabbaged up. `Timid.' That's another.''
   ``George Bush has been through all of that,'' Simpson said. ``In
eight years (as vice president) he was called ... a `wimp,'
`sycophant,' `lapdog.' ... Didn't faze him a bit.''
   ``So there won't be any response from George Bush at these
yapping dogs,'' Simpson said. ``And there are yapping dogs out
there.''
   Actually Bush did respond in an interview on Tuesday with The
New York Times.
   ``Democrats on Capitol Hill have been calling me `timid,' he
said. ``I have other, better words like `cautious,' `diplomatic,'
`prudent.'''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun called on legislators
Wednesday to reject a peace plan they passed during a special
Parliament session in Saudi Arabia, and his hostility left him
politically isolated even in his Christian camp.
   Fearing Aoun's wrath might land them in jail, some Christian
legislators delayed their return to Beirut.
   Christian political, militia and religious leaders declared
cautious support for the accord. The main political alliance urged
Lebanese leaders to ``show flexibility in dealing with it.''
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir of the Maronite church was quoted in
radio interviews from Rome as supporting the plan, which would
shift political control from the Christian minority to the Moslem
majority but reserve the presidency for a Maronite.
   Aoun scorned it in a speech to young Christian demonstrators at
the war-battered remnants of the presidential palace east of Beirut.
   He repeated that he accepted the political reforms but rejected
the accord's lack of a deadline for the withdrawal of the 40,000
Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   ``No to the accord of capitulation! No to surrender!'' the
estimated 2,000 demonstrators chanted, waving posters of Aoun and
flags of Lebanon.
   Parliament approved the plan Sunday after 23 days of talks in
the Saudi resort of Taif. It is aimed at ending 14 years of civil
war.
   Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria _ assigned by the Arab League
to mediate the Lebanon crisis _ urged Parliament to convene by Nov.
7 in Beirut to formally approve it and elect a president.
   The White House said the Bush administration supports the accord.
   The Lebanese Front alliance of right-wing Christian groups
declared support for the plan, which was approved by 59 of the 62
lawmakers at Taif.
   The front's president, George Saadeh, voted for it. Saadeh heads
the Phalange Party, the main Christian political group in Lebanon.
   The Lebanese Front ``pleads with all officials and leaders to
show flexibility in dealing with initiatives to settle the Lebanese
crisis,'' a statement said.
   Saadeh and five deputies went to Rome to seek church backing for
the plan.
   Parliament deputy Raymond Edde, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun,
announced in Paris that he will run for president.
   Edde, who has been living in self-imposed exile following
repeated attempts to assassinate him in Lebanon, was the first
person to announce candidacy for the post.
   Lebanon has been without a president since Sept. 22, 1988, when
Amin Gemayel's term expired and Parliament was unable to decide on
a successor.
   Gemayel named Aoun head of an interim military Cabinet pending
election of a new president.
   Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment and swore allegiance to the
Cabinet of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   One senior official in the Phalange Party, speaking anonymously,
said Aoun felt abandoned by the plan because it does not fulfull
his goal of driving the Syrians out of the country.
   Syrian troops were deployed in 1976 under an Arab League mandate
to quell the civil war. Aoun said they violated the mandate by
siding with the Moslems in the war.
   ``The general rightfully feels he is left out in the cold. He is
the main loser as a result of the Taif accord and it looks like
he's not going to take it gracefully,'' said the official.

<HEAD>Artists Rally For More Government Money</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of artists and their supporters staged a
National Arts Advocacy Day on Wednesday and warned that theaters,
museums and other institutions are being ``squeezed to death'' by
government cutbacks.
   Subsidized theater in Britain is ``as much under threat as the
Amazonian rain forests,'' said Richard Eyre, director of the Royal
National Theatre.
   The demonstrators rallied at the South Bank Arts Center, home of
the Royal Festival Hall and the National Theater, before heading to
the House of Commons to urge lawmakers to be more generous with
funding for the arts.
   John Bowis, a legislator for the governing Conservative Party,
said they would have to exert ``huge pressure'' because the arts
were of little interest to most members of Parliament, or MPs.
   ``The last time I initiated a debate on the arts there were
about 40 MPs present out of 650'' in the House of Commons, he said.
   Speakers accused the government of underestimating the value of
the arts to British life and as a revenue earner. More than 300
people attended the rally, organizers said.
   ``Britain has an artistic talent all round which is second to
none, but which is being squeezed to death,'' said Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies, the composer and conductor.
   Years of belt-tightening by arts organizations are being wasted
because of rising inflation, said Luke Rittner, the
government-appointed secretary-general of the Arts Council, which
distributes government arts subsidies. He pleaded for another $64
million of government aid over the next three years.
   Since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives won power
in 1979, government financial support for the arts has fallen by 19
percent, said Simon Crine, director of the National Campaign for
the Arts, which organized the events.
   Total government spending this year on arts and libraries,
including the 19 national museums, is officially estimated at $1.3
billion, of which $707 million is for the arts alone.
   The Arts Council receives $245 million of that for drama, music,
opera, dance, movies and videos, touring companies and art
exhibitions.
   Local authorities spend a further $316 million and business
sponsorship amounts to $47 million.
   Arts organizers say the inflation rate of 7.6 percent has thrown
many ensembles and projects into crisis and the government's own
advisory body, the Museums and Galleries Commission, said in July
that inflation and wage increases have risen four times as much as
its grants.
   Britain's flagship arts center, the heavily subsidized Royal
Opera House, has a projected deficit this year of nearly $4
million; the Royal Shakespeare Company is more than $1.58 million
in the red and the National Theater, the financially strongest of
the trio, only balanced its books this year by drawing on reserves.
   The British Museum faces the first deficit in its 236-year
history, about $1.58 million, largely because funding has failed to
match civil service pay hikes, said Sir David Wilson, its director.
   Subsidized theater in Britain is ``as much under threat as the
Amazonian rain forests,'' said Richard Eyre, director of the Royal
National Theatre.
   Peter Palumbo, the millionaire real estate developer and
chairman of the Arts Council, said last week that Britons should
abandon the outdated perception of the arts as a recreational
pastime for amateurs.
   The arts are a major industry, employing 500,000 people and with
an annual revenue of $19 billion, he said.

   The ozone pollution reported in some cities
last year was caused mostly by unusually hot weather, not dirtier
air, an industry-supported analysis said Wednesday.
   ``The environmental community would have you believe we are in
an ozone crisis, but that is not the case,'' said William D. Fay,
administrator of the Clean Air Working Group.
   With the exceptions of Los Angeles, Houston and sometimes New
York ``our cities are facing neither an ozone crisis nor an
intractable ozone problem,'' said Fay.
   Dr. Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund
disagreed, however, contending that ``most of the eastern United
States has too much ozone.''
   Emissions and weather are the factors that affect pollution,
said Oppenheimer. Emissions have been increasing with the improving
economy, he said. And while 1988 was an unusual year, if climate
warming does occur as some scientisis fear, that would increase
future pollution levels.
   Congress is considering legislation which would tighten
emissions standards for automobiles, businesses and industry, and
last summer's increased smog levels have been cited in debates over
that measure.
   Several cities did record dramatic increases in the number of
times their air quality failed to meet federal standards last year.
   But Kay H. Jones of the Seattle research firm Roy F. Weston
Inc., said his analysis of ozone readings in more than 70 major
cities shows that 1988 was an aberration.
   For much of the nation, the summer of 1988 was the hottest since
the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s, and the excessive heat generated
more ozone in large cities, Jones said.
   Ozone, a highly reactive form of oxygen, is a major constituent
of urban smog. Heat speeds the chemical reactions which form ozone.
   Conditions returned to nearly normal this past summer, Jones
said. For example, he said, Atlanta exceeded ozone standards for 19
days in 1988 and only once in 1989. For other cities the excessive
days included Baltimore, 34 in 1988 and 2 in 1989, Chicago, 27 in
1988 and 3 in 1989; New York, 39 in 1988 and 12 in 1989 and
Washington, 30 in 1988 n London Metal Exchange warehouse
stocks and a pending strike vote at Exxon Corp. mines in Chile.
   ``Strikes and shutdowns that had been supporting prices for a
while back are settled and copper is not in such tight supply,''
said Demler.
   Copper settled 35 to 45 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in October at $1.15 a pound.
   Also on the Comex, the steadier stock market and stronger dollar
sent gold and silver futures slightly lower.
   ``It's been a pretty dead metals market lately, with not much
major news to generate any sudden shifts,'' said Diane Meagher of
Deak International Inc. in Chicago.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.10 lower, with the contract for delivery
in October at $369.10 a troy ounce; and silver was 3.4 cents to 3.5
cents lower, with October at $5.114 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices were mostly higher in very light trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Futures were supported by a false rumor during the day that an
earthquake had hit Alaska, said Mike Rothman, senior oil anaylst
for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   He also said traders were discounting the 6.304 million barrels
of crude oil listed in Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute
inventory report.
   ``They believe stocks were depleted by the effects of Hurricane
Jerry and there will be off-setting figures in next week's
report,'' said Rothman.
   Crude futures settled 10 cents lower to 23 cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in November at $18.83 a barrel; heating
oil was .20 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with November at 58.44
cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .61 cent
higher, with November at 53.40 a gallon.
   Futures prices for corn and soybeans climbed higher, but wheat
prices sagged on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   This week's light trading continued for a third day, with little
outside news of any major consequence for the futures markets, said
Susan Leighty, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Lack of export demand and beneficial rains for both the South
American and U.S. winter crop were depressing wheat prices, Ms.
Leighty said.
   Supporting futures prices was new Soviet interest in the
agricultural markets, as the Soviet Union purchased 50,000 metric
tons of Argentine meal and 350,000 metric tons of corn from
Yugoslavia since Tuesday, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 6\ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.05{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2\
cents higher, with December at $2.42\ a bushel; oats were } cent to
1\ cents lower, with December at $1.46 a bushel; and soybeans were
3 cents to 6 cents higher, with November at $5.66 a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and pork prices
were mostly higher.
   ``We had a late rally in the final 20 minutes, mostly on
commission house buying,'' said Chicago analyst Phil Stanley of DEC
Futures Inc.
   Lighter supplies of cattle, but not so light for hogs were
affecting prices, Stanley said.
   Cattle settled .02 cent lower to .03 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at 75.20 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .03 cent lower to .30 cent higher, with October at
83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .27 cent
higher, with December at 47.80 cents a pound; and forzen pork
bellies were .20 cent to .55 cent higher with February at 53.32
cents a pound.
   The stock-index futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange followed the New York Stock Exchange to lower ground.
   The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 1.85 points lower at 344.65.
Each point is worth $500.

<HEAD>Bush Costa Rican Trip to Underscore Desire for Change in Nicaragua,

<TEXT>
   President Bush flies to Costa Rica on Friday
to join an international celebration of a century of democracy in
the host country and underscore his desire for political change in
Nicaragua and Panama.
   Administration officials say Bush's participation in two days of
ceremonies hosted by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias will be
low-key. The president, one of 18 heads of state expected to
attend, is not on the list of speakers for the formal proceedings.
   ``The diplomacy in Latin America is such that you don't want to
do anything to try and upstage these countries ... We are going to
pay respect to them,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   At the same time, administration and Costa Rican sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush refused to sign a
general communique that Costa Rican officials had prepared to
express support for democracy and environmental protection.
   The president ``objected to signing any statement with
(Nicaraguan President) Daniel Ortega,'' said one administration
official, who added that for a variety of reasons, the paper will
not be issued.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday he and Bush
would be discussing three ``challenges to democracy'' with
officials at the Costa Rican sessions _ illegal drug trafficking,
the aut the first woman justice in the
200-year history of the Supreme Court, gave Chief Justice William
Rehnquist the vote he had sought for 16 years _ a working majority
to begin dismantling the ``Roe'' decision written by fellow Justice
Harry Blackmun in 1973.
   For now, business continues as usual at most of the clinics and
hospitals that annually perform legal abortions on three out of
every 100 American women of childbearing age. Under the new ruling,
more than 95 percent could proceed without legal interruption,
because that is the proportion who get abortions earlier than the
point at which the states may now intercede.
   But with three more challenges to Roe on the justices' docket,
it may not be long before the court jettisons the landmark 1973
decision entirely, allowing states either to re-criminalize all
abortions or impose any of dozens of proposed restrictions, ranging
from mandatory parental or spousal consent to forced medical
testing of the fetus and psychological counseling of the mother.
   Blackmun himself wrote that the signs his decision will be
explicitly overturned ``are evident and very ominous, and a chill
wind blows.''
   Some saw the Missouri ruling as the grandest judicial
affirmation to date of Ronald Reagan's revolution. Others say it
may prove, ironically, to unravel it. The opinion of the court's
majority simply is not shared by the majority of Americans.
   Most polls, including a Media General-Associated Press survey
last summer, say that by a 2-1 margin, Americans believe abortions
should be legal. But they are more evenly divided, and in some
cases tilt the other way, on questions regarding public spending,
parental consent and related curbs.
   Charlotte Taft, director of a women's clinic in Dallas, puts t
this way: ``Americans favor abortion only in the case of rape,
incest and their own personal circumstance.''
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart says many Republicans outside the
religious right _ those in the suburban mainstream of the party _
``have always given a wink and a nod'' to their candidates' stated
abortion views. But now that the court has made abortion a hot
political issue, he says, ``many will not find that acceptable
anymore.''
   William Schneider of the conservative American Enterprise
Institute echoed that view when he warned GOP politicians that
suburban defections ``could drive a stake through the heart of the
Reagan coalition.''
   Republican consultant Roger Stone, however, says the Democratic
Party, which unequivocally endorsed abortion rights in its platform
last year, stands to lose its last conservative bloc, the urban,
blue-collar Roman Catholics.
   There are no guarantees to any of these theories. Even the
Catholic coalition cannot be taken for granted, despite the
church's vehement opposition to abortion. Indeed, Guttmacher
researchers have found that Catholic women are more likely to have
an abortion than either Protestant or Jewish women _ probably
because they practice less birth control. Another somewhat
startling finding: One out of every six women who have an abortion
describes herself as an evangelical Christian.
   There will be some early clues on the political scene. Abortion
is an issue in two gubernatorial races next month, in New Jersey
and Virginia, as well as the mayoral contest in New York City. And
next year, 36 gubernatorial races as well as the U.S. House and a
third of the Senate will be fought.
   The pro-choice movement, meanwhile, is back on the march _
starting with a demonstration that drew more than 300,000 people to
the capital on the eve of the Supreme Court's hearing of the
Missouri case. And it was buoyed last month by the Florida
Legislature's wholesale rebuke of the anti-abortion laws Gov. Bob
Martinez tried to push through a special session. Moreover, for the
first time this decade, the House and Senate passed a bill that
would have granted rape and incest victims federal assistance for
abortions. Bush vetoed it this past week.
   ``Read our lips: Take our rights, lose your jobs,'' says Kate
Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
At its 20th anniversary convention, the league named nine
politicians, including Martinez and Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, as special targets for defeat next year.
   According to Larry Sabato, political scientist at the University
of Virginia, abortion is likely to become ``The Beirut of American
politics _ a no-win issue.'' California pollster Mervin Field says
the nation's 7,500 state legislators are ``saying `Oh, my God,' and
wondering how they can control the damage.''
   The anit-abortion movement, meanwhile, is content to take things
one step at a time. ``We believe the court will permit the states
and Congress to restrict the reasons for abortions,'' says Douglas
Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee.
   Overall, more than half the states are regarded as likely to
enact some restrictions, another eight to 10 are battlegrounds, and
10 to 15 are likely to retain full abortion-on-demand rights.
   Part of the strategy of abortion opponents is to create such a
blizzard of consent and testing requirements that clinics and
doctors will give up their abortion services as legally or
financially risky. The anti-abortion shock troops, meanwhile,
belong to ``Operation Rescue,'' a largely white, evangelical
Christian group that counts 35,000 members and thousands of arrests
while demonstrating at abortion clinics around the country.
   Typically, its ``rescues'' entail forming a human blockade
around the clinic, while ``sidewalk counselors'' attempt to turn
away the women trying to get through. Some protestors have entered
clinics and damaged medical equipment with eggs and fake blood.
   The group, disowned by many in the anti-abortion movement, is
led by young Randall Terry, who carts a disfigured, splotchy fetus
he calls ``Baby Choice'' around the country in a jar of
formaldehyde. At news conferences, he lays the fetus out in a tiny
coffin lined with white satin. Terry, a former used-car salesman,
will point to the fetus and declare: ``That's not a blob of cells.
That's a little girl.''
   Operation Rescue also distributes a video designed to evoke
equal shock. It features shots of aborted fetuses mixed with scenes
of Nazi concentration camps. A somewhat milder video, called ``the
Silent Scream,'' has been circulated for years by other
anti-abortion groups.
   Now, the pro-choice forces are distributing a video of their
own. Produced by the Fund for the Feminist Majority, it is called
``Abortion: For Survival'' and depicts an actual abortion that
lasts 84 seconds and shows two aborted embryos, amounting to about
two tablespoons of blood and tissue. The point is to demonstrate
that what is swept from the womb in most abortions is not nearly
the baby-like figure depicted by the opposition.
   Whatever the tactics, the abortion war looms, like the civil
rights struggle and Vietnam, as a long and painful one for the
country. The difference is that nobody predicts an end to this
fight, by law or by conscience.

<HEAD>Bush Will Act to Ease Consumer Concerns Over Pesticides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moving to ease consumer concerns over food
safety, President Bush is preparing to announce a streamlining of
regulations so that dangerous chemicals can be taken off the market
more quickly, sources said Wednesday.
   The administration's new policy for dealing with pesticides and
other chemicals in foods is aimed at giving the Environmental
Protection Agency greater flexibility in dealing with food safety
issues.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly declined on Wednesday to
provide details of the impending policy announcement, but told
reporters ``it's responsive to a number of problems this agency has
had in administering our pesticide law.''
   The president is expected to announce the food safety initiative
at the White House on Thursday.
   Industry spokesmen reserved comment on the new policy until it
is announced. Environmentalists said that while they welcome some
aspects of the new policy, they have concerns about other
provisions.
   According to sources familiar with the revision, it will include
a shift in the procedures used by the EPA in determine whether a
potentially dangerous pesticide should be taken off the market. The
EPA no longer will be required to have a formal judicial hearing
and may opt for a swifter rulemaking process that could
significantly reduce the time it takes to ban a chemical.
   Environmentalists said that such a shift could reduce the time
it takes to get a dangerous pesticide off the market from as long
as eight years under current procedures to about two years.
   If risks warrant, the EPA also will be given greater leeway in
suspending use of pesticides and other chemicals used on foods
while the formal proceedings get underway, the sources said. The
agency will no longer have to prove an ``imminent hazard'' to
public health to suspend a chemical, as is required under current
policy. In some cases, the agency will not have to take into
account economic ramifications of its action in suspending a
chemical.
   The EPA has been under attack from environmentalists for failing
to act swiftly to protect the country's food supply from dangerous
levels of pesticide residues _ including carcinogens _ in foods,
especially on fruits and vegetables.
   The issue gained widespread attention earlier this year when EPA
officials acknowledged that daminozide, a growth-regulating
compound marketed under the name Alar, caused cancer, but were
unable to take it off the market immediately because the agency did
believe it met the ``imminent hazard'' standard.
   A public outcry over the use of Alar on apples subsequently
caused its manufacturer to stop selling the chemical voluntarily.
   The maker of another widely used chemical, the fungicide EBDC,
recently announced it was stopping sale of the compound for use on
a variety of food crops, but continued to make it available for use
on many other fruits and vegetables. The EPA has been reviewing the
status of EBDC since 1977, when it was discovered that a byproduct
of the family of fungicides is a potential human carcinogen.
   Although the new administration policy will allow the EPA to
make more timely decisions on protecting foods from harmful
pesticide residues, the plan also contains provisions that are
expected to be attacked by environmentalists.
   The policy, for example, will relax the threshold at which a
chemical in some cases will be considered to pose an unacceptable
risk, according to the sources, who commented under the condition
that they not be further identified.
   The EPA under current policy has said action is warranted if the
risk of cancer or other serious illness is 1 in 1 million. Under
the new policy, the EPA may choose not to act in some cases unless
the risk is as great as 1 in 100,000.
   In addition, the administration will propose that pesticide
regulation be ``uniform'' across the country.
   That, according to environmentalists, amounts to administration
endorsement of congressional action to pre-empt states from
imposing tougher pesticide laws than federal requirements.
   Jay Feldman of the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides said any preemptive provision would be opposed by
environmentalists. ``Most of the major federal actions (in the past
on pesticides) have been preceded by state actions which serve as
an important check and balance,'' said Feldman.

<HEAD>Bush Presses for Senate Vote on Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush forcefully pressed for a clear
shot at a Senate vote on a lower capital gains tax in a meeting
Wednesday with Senate Democrats, but was told his chances were
slim, participants said.
   The lawmakers said after a White House meeting that they told
Bush his only realistic hope was to support a compromise package
that included other items as well.
   While balking at the notion of delaying action on such a measure
until next year, Bush expressed willingness to discuss a compromise
package, said the senators.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said when he proposed that the capital
gains change be linked with a higher minimum wage, White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu ``put a pad in front of me and said,
`Write it out.'''
   Harkin was one of eight Democrats invited to the White House by
Bush as the president continued to lobby Democrats for a
straightforward vote on the capital gains proposal.
   The White House is seeking Senate approval of a provision passed
by the House that would lower the tax on capital gains _ profits
from the sale of real estate, stocks and other assets _ to 19.6
percent for two years, from the current maximum rate of 33 percent.
   But the Senate Democratic leadership has resisted scheduling a
simple vote on the measure, and the White House in the past few
days has stepped up its lobbying campaign.
   ``If the administration continues to push for an up-and-down
vote on capital gains to the exclusion of everything else, that's
just not going to happen,'' Harkin said.
   Senators who met with Bush said the president was repeatedly
told there was little likelihood he would get a vote on a separate
capital gains tax bill this year.
   The blunt assessment was more substantial in that it came from a
group of Democrats who in the past had supported either a capital
gains tax cut, or some form of capital gains incentives.
   Bush met with Harkin and Sens. Brock Adams of Washington, Max
Baucus of Montana, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Wyche Fowler
Jr. of Georgia, John Glenn of Ohio, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts
and Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado.
   Participants said that, in addition to the capital gains
proposal, the final package might include a Democratic-sponsored
plan to expand coverage of Individual Retirement Accounts as well
as legislation to deal with the minimum wage and child care.
   ``It's clear that most people feel they've got to resolve this
in some sort of sensible way that involves compromises on both
sides,'' Kerry told reporters.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president was agreeable to
``possible compromises'' on the proposal, but did not suggest what
form such a package might take.
   ``We are working to pick up new votes all the time,'' he said.
   However, it seemed unlikely Bush picked up any in Wednesday's
session.
   ``The president presented his position very forcefully,'' Glenn
said.
   Participants said Bush opened Wednesday's meeting by denying
that he was seeking to make the issue a ``Holy Grail,'' as Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, had asserted on Tuesday.
   The House attached the capital gains cut to broader
deficit-reduction bill which is now in a House-Senate conference
committee.
   The Senate version does not contain the cut. Democrats have
threatened to filibuster if the conference committee produces a
compromise version containing the capital gains provision.
   It would take 60 votes to shut off such a filibuster, votes
Republicans do not appear to have.
   Negotiators from the Senate and House began the efforts
Wednesday to work out a compromise between the different
deficit-reduction bills passed by the two chambers but made little
headway.

   Col. Moammar Gadhafi for the first time
acknowledged Libya bankrolled terrorist groups but said he
mistakenly thought the action would further the Arab cause,
according to an interview published Wednesday.
   ``At one point, we supported some of these groups without
meticulously examining their aims and role,'' the Egyptian
government-owned weekly magazine Al-Mussawar quoted him as saying.
   ``But when we discovered that these groups were causing more
harm than benefit to the Arab cause, we halted our aid to them
completely and withdrew our support,'' he told Al-Mussawar editor
Makram Mohammed Ahmed, a confidant of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   Gadhafi also said he wants no confrontation with the United
States and would welcome a dialogue toward friendlier relations.
   The magazine said Ahmed conducted the interview a week ago, a
day after Gadhafi met with Mubarak in Tobruk on Libya's
Mediterranean coast to discuss improving relations after 16 years
of friction.
   Gadhafi, a disciple of the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel
Nasser and currently the main proponent of Nasser's ideas on Arab
unity, did not identify any terror groups that were backed by
Libya. One is known to be the Fatah Revolutionary Council, a
dissident Palestinian group led by Abu Nidal, whose real name is
Sabry el-Banna.
   In the past, Gadhafi insisted he helped only nationalist, not
international movements.
   ``We erroneously thought that these groups could be part of the
(Arab) national liberation movement,'' he said. ``But we found out
that they were practicing terrorism for the sake of terrorism and
for other objectives that had nothing to do with our national cause.
   ``Let me tell you frankly that hijacking planes and killing
civilians are acts of murder that have nothing to do with combat,''
Gadhafi said. ``(Libya) should not be called to account for any of
these acts, because we have withdrawn our support of such groups.''
   Gadhafi's sponsorship of international terror was the principal
cause of his rift with the United States. In September 1987, U.S.
officials presented to the United Nations a selected chronology
specifying 60 cases of what they termed Libya's terrorism and
support for various terrorist groups.
   U.S. warplanes raided two Libyan cities, the capital of Tripoli
and the Mediterranean port of Benghazi in April 1986, 10 days after
Libya was blamed for masterminding the bombing of a discotheque in
West Berlin frequented by U.S. servicemen.
   An American soldier and a woman died in the bombing and 200
people were wounded.
   In the interview, Gadhafi seemed to be telling the Americans he
wants bygones to be bygones and is eager to turn a new leaf.
   He said he would welcome a dialogue with the Americans
``anywhere they want on condition it is held in the public eye.
   ``I say very clearly: We do not believe that conflict with the
United States is necessary. We believe that many of the problems
between us can be solved at the negotiating table.''
   He blamed former President Reagan's ``muscle-flexing'' for
complications in American-Libyan relations and said he felt that
President Bush's administration ``will be more rational.''
   In the eight-page interview, Gadhafi also made these points:
   _ Libya has enough arms to meet its needs and is not seeking
more from the Soviet Union, its principal armorer.
   _ Libya would not object to a proposed peace dialogue between
the Palestinians and Israel.
   _ Egypt and Libya should pursue their reconciliation and forge
closer relations. He said: ``It would be silly and idiotic to
quarrel and trade insults again.''
   In Naples, Italy, police on Wednesday blocked 800 Libyans who
arrived by boat to mark a day of ``mourning'' declared by Gadhafi
for Libyans deported during Italian colonial rule. Police said the
passengers lacked entry visas.
   The Libyans, as well as several hundred others who have arrived
over the past few days, were planning to take part in
demonstrations scheduled in Rome and other cities on Thursday.
   The demonstrations are in memory of Libyans deported to Italy
during colonial rule between 1911 and the end of World War II.
Libya contends at least 4,000 Libyans were sent to Italy.
   Libya says Oct. 26 is the 78th anniversary of the first
deportations to remote Italian islands.
   Gadhafi wants Italy to pay reparations for its colonial
occupation. Rome insists it met its obligations by paying $6.7
million in 1956 under an agreement with the Libyan monarchy later
deposed by Gadhafi in a 1969 coup.

   Mobs dragged passengers from a train and
killed four of them in eastern Bihar state, bringing to 17 the
number of deaths blamed on fighting Wednesday between Moslems and
Hindus, news reports said.
   United News of India said all the deaths were in Bhagalpur, a
remote city of 300,000 where four people died in sectarian violence
on Tuesday.
   The area has been plagued by looting and arson and the news
agency said troops were dispatched to the region on Wednesday to
keep order. It said they were given orders to shoot lawbreakers on
sight.
   United News said that mobs attacked an express train near
Bhagalpur, dragged passengers from the car and killed four. Mobs
also attacked a local train and wounded six, it said.
   The religions of the victims in the latest clashes were not
known.
   A state government official in Patna, Bihar's capital, said
police found only nine bodies of people killed in clashes
Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
25 policemen were wounded.
   Bhagalpur, on the Ganges River that is sacred to Hindus, is
about 110 miles east of Patna and about 220 miles northwest of
Calcutta.
   The deaths brought to 41 the number of people killed in
Hindu-Moslem clashes since Sunday in four villages across Bihar
state, one of the poorest and most violent in India.
   Some of clashes coincided with processions by Hindu militants
who are collecting bricks to build a temple at Ayodhya, in
neighboring Uttar Pradesh state, where Hindus and Moslems both lay
claim to the same religious site.
   Moslems make up 11 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
comprise 82 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   Firefighter Gerry Shannon, who rescued a
woman 12 years ago only to have her die, grabbed the woman pinned
in her blazing Marina apartment and held on like man in a grudge
match with death.
   The 19-year veteran firefighter found Sherra Cox lying in the
dust and blackness, trapped under a door and doorframe when two
upper floors of her apartment building collapsed during the Oct. 17
earthquake.
   ``When somebody holds your hand and you're a few feet away, I
doubt I'll ever feel that again. I felt like I knew her and I
couldn't go no matter what was happening,'' said Shannon, 44.
   When he heard someone was trapped, he found an opening in the
rubble of a sidewall. Throwing off his coat and helmet, he crawled
inside the dark two-foot hole lighting his way with a flashlight.
   Cox, 55, had dislodged an iron pole and was banging it with her
one free arm.
   ``I am here,'' she called to Shannon, who crawled toward the
voice.
   Outside, firefighters and spectators, who smelled the gas
enveloping the building and saw flames igniting, yelled for Sannnon
to leave.
   ``It got real bright and hot when the building across the street
fell. I saw her eyes got wide. I heard someone stick his head in
and yell to get out. She just squeezed hard and said, `Please don't
leave me,'' he said.
   The struggle brought back memories of 12 years ago when Shannon
was off-duty and pulled a woman from an apartment fire, but she
died shortly after of smoke inhalation.
   ``What I've thought the most about is when I heard everybody
tell me to get out. ... I knew the building was on fire, and it
felt like we were both done for but I couldn't leave her,'' he said.
   But Shannon needed equipment or both could die.
   He crawled outside, and Capt. Robert Boudoures handed him a
chainsaw. Shannon went back and began to cut the timbers. After
more than an hour, Shannon cut Cox free.
   Another rescue worker shoved in a stretcher and helped pull Cox
out.
   Cox was taken to San Francisco General Hospital where she
underwent seven hours of surgery for a dislocated, fractured hip
and cracked pelvis. She was in fair to good condition Wednesday.
   ``I saw her yesterday in the hospital. She's doing great. She's
a real tough gal,'' said Shannon.

   Earthquakes on one side of San Francisco Bay
have been matched within three years by similar-sized quakes on the
other side, raising the possibility that another might now be due
in Oakland, researchers say.
   An earthquake that hit Oakland's side of the bay in 1836 was
followed by a quake on the San Francisco side in 1838, and an
earthquake that hit the San Francisco peninsula in 1865 was
followed by an Oakland quake three years later. All the earthquakes
had magnitudes of 6.3 to 7.0.
   The 1865 earthquake occurred near the Loma Prieta area of the
San Francisco peninsula, where the Oct. 17 earthquake occurred,
according to a report to appear Friday in Science magazine.
   An Oakland quake similar in size on the Richter scale to the
Oct. 17 earthquake would cause far more damage, said Allan Lindh of
the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. ``As horrible as
this one is, it's just nothing compared to when we get an
earthquake this size in the urban areas (in and near Oakland),'' he
told Science.
   Lindh could not be reached Wednesday.
   Lindh, William Ellsworth and their colleagues in Menlo Park
report that the 70 years leading up to the big San Francisco
earthquake of 1906 were marked by numerous earthquakes, and that
activity was sharply reduced after the big quake.
   In a telephone interview, Lynn Sykes, a seismologist at the
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University in
Palisades, N.Y., said there are reasons to believe the two sides of
the bay are seismologically linked.
   Just as there was activity in the Oakland area before the 1906
earthquake, there was activity there before the Oct. 17 quake,
Sykes said.
   ``There were a number of magnitude 5 to magnitude 6 earthquakes
in the East Bay starting around 1973,'' he said. ``I would say in
both instances, the stress or pressures in the Earth were building
up,'' he said.
   The question now is: Did the Oct. 17 quake relieve pressures
that had been building in the East Bay? Or did it increase
pressures there, making a matching quake likely?

   Palestinians killed three fellow Arabs in the
occupied territories on Wednesday, including a woman accused of
subverting the Palestinian revolt by dealing in prostitution.
   As police found the body of one victim in an abandoned car,
masked youths appeared on a nearby hill and shouted ``Allahu
akbar!'' _ Arabic for ``God is great!''
   In Tel Aviv, judges sentenced a West Bank Palestinian to life in
prison plus 20 years after he pleaded guilty to murdering an
Israeli construction worker and trying to careen a crowded public
bus into a steep ravine last month.
   Also Wednesday, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said U.S. Middle
East peace proposals must be changed to more closely reflect
Israel's own initiative before they can be accepted by the
government.
   Arens wants the United States to exclude Cairo as the site for a
preliminary Israel-Palestinian meeting and to change language
suggesting Palestinians from outside the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip may take part, an Israeli official said.
   In the Gaza Strip, police found the body of an accused
collaborator, Fayez Mohammed Sahlawi, 29, in the trunk of a car
parked north of his home village of Beit Hanoun. They said an
initial investigation indicated he was shot to death. Masked youths
fled the scene after shouting their war cry.
   In the Mughazi refugee camp in Gaza, masked youths stabbed and
beat to death Fayza Abdul Salam, 50, Arab reporters said. She was
accused of dealing in prostitution.
   In the West Bank, eight masked men kidnapped Salah Abu al-Wafa,
38, from his house in the northern town of Jenin on Tuesday, axed
him to death and dumped his body near his house, town residents
told reporters.
   The residents said al-Wafa was accused of working with the
Israeli intelligence agents and dealing in drugs.
   The army spokesman's office confirmed the deaths of both Ms.
Salam and al-Wafa.
   The deaths raised to 135 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators, or as drug dealers or
prostitutes, during the 22-month Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In Tel Aviv, a district court sentenced 26-year-old Ahmed
Shukry, of Ramallah, to life plus 20 years after he pleaded guilty
Wednesday to one count of murder and 51 counts of attempted murder.
   Shukry's second sentence would start should he be granted
parole, which is possible after 20 years under a life sentence in
Israel, meaning he faced at least 40 years in prison.
   Shukry was convicted of murdering Michael Eshtener, 38, at a Tel
Aviv building site Sept. 7 and of stabbing an Israeli bus driver
two days later in an attempt to force a bus off the Jerusalem-Tel
Aviv highway into a ravine.
   Shukry's attempt occurred near the spot where a Palestinian
forced a bus on the same route off a cliff on July 6, killing 16
Jews, including a U.S. tourist and two Canadians.
   ``In the occupied territories (Arab) children are being killed
every day,'' army radio quoted Shukry as telling the court. ``I
wanted to kill Jewish children.''
   At least 603 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the uprising. According to the Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights, more than 120 of those killed were under
age 16. Forty Israelis have also died in the violence.
   The foreign minister, interviewed by government-run radio,
disputed a report by the Israeli Embassy in Washington that he
already had agreed in principle to a five-point peace plan of U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``We are working in order to ensure that the formula presented
by the secretary of state will be the same as the government's
decision, the government's initiative,'' Arens told the radio from
Brussels, where he is attending a meeting.
   The Israeli peace initiative calls for elections in the occupied
lands to select Palestinians to open talks with Israel on limited
autonomy. It rules out any role for the PLO, which Israel considers
a terrorist organization.
   Israeli officials have opposed Cairo as a venue for preliminary
talks because they believe Egypt is trying to act as an
intermediary for the PLO.
   In Washington, Baker said the suggested changes will be reviewed
but cautioned: ``If we start making changes for one side, we will
find ourselves in an extended negotiating session in terms of
making changes that might be requested.
   ``It would be much better if both sides would accept the five
points as a general framework for moving forward,'' he said.
   A Foreign Ministry official said he could not comment until he
saw a text of Baker's remarks.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday defended his agency's political independence and warned
that proposals to make the central bank more accountable to
Congress and the administration could hamper its fight against
inflation.
   Greenspan was the lead-off witnesses as Congress launched its
first major review in more than a decade of the operations of the
Federal Reserve and its chairman, often called the second most
powerful man in the country because of the Fed's power over
interest rates.
   Greenspan said he opposed a bill sponsored by Reps. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., that they say would
make the central bank's deliberations less secretive and more
accountable to the public.
   The Hamilton-Dorgan bill would require the Fed's top
policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, to meet with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and other Bush administration
officials at regular intervals.
   The bill would also require immediate release of decisions made
by the FOMC and it would change the term of the Fed chairman so
that an incoming president would be able to appoint a new chairman
sooner after taking office.
   Greenspan rejected all of these proposals, contending they
increased the risks that the Fed would set interest rates in
response to political pressures rather than on judgments about what
was best for the long-run health of the economy.
   ``The Federal Reserve must take actions that, while sometimes
unpopular in the short-run, are in the long-run best interests of
the country,'' Greenspan said, adding the Fed's 75-year history of
independence had ``served the country well.''
   While voicing strong opposition to the Hamilton-Dorgan bill,
Greenspan did endorse a separate resolution sponsored by Rep.
Stephen Neal, D-N.C., that would write into law a requirement that
the Fed eliminate inflation and give the central bank five years to
reach that goal.
   Terming Neal's measure a ``laudable'' effort to clarify the
Fed's mandate, Greenspan warned that wringing inflation out of the
economy over the next five years would have short-term costs in
terms of slower growth. He termed the 1994 deadline achievable and
said it could be accomplished without plunging the country into a
recession.
   Consumer prices, after spurting up sharply early in the year,
are now rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, very close to the
rate of inflation over the past several years.
   Neal's measure does not include any penalties if the Fed fails
to meet the five-year deadline for eliminating inflation, but Neal
argued that the resolution would clarify existing law, which
directs the Fed to pursue the sometimes conflicting goals of
promoting employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest
rates.
   In his appearance before Congress, Greenspan sought to play down
reports of a major rift between the Fed and the Bush administration
over interest rates. The administration has been pushing the Fed to
lower rates in an effort to spur economic growth and lower the
international exchange rate of the dollar.
   Greenspan said that he and the administration ``have differences
on occasions'' but that what was being interpreted as major
disputes were in reality only disagreements concerning ``relatively
minor issues of tactics.''
   Both the Neal measure and the Hamilton-Dorgan proposal are given
slight chance of getting through Congress because of opposition in
the Senate, where key members of the Senate Banking Committee have
given the Fed high marks and said they see no reason to make
changes.

<HEAD>House Votes to Defer Deporting Chinese, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday voted 258-162 to
protect thousands of illegal aliens who fled conflict in their
homelands by deferring their deportation to China, El Salvador and
Nicaragua.
   ``It will create humanitarian relief for three categories of
individuals who are here in the United States and for whom there is
no will to send them back,'' said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.
   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would suspend for three
years deportation of Chinese, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans who
register within nine months.
   It would stop short of granting political asylum or permanent
resident status, but would provide temporary protection to perhaps
750,000 exiles.
   It also would establish a system for extending such temporary
status to citizens of additional countries beset by armed conflict
and natural disaster.
   The measure is designed to furnish shelter to those who have
fled civil war in Central America and face government persecution
as a result of the student democracy demonstrations in China.
   Proponents said 70,000 Salvadorans and 30,000 Nicaraguan
civilians have been killed in civil wars in their countries over
the last decade and that 10,000 participants in the Chinese
democracy demonstrations have been jailed.
   They scoffed at complaints that the measure would create an
exception that would undermine existing immigration law.
   Critics said it was a mistake to combine relief measures for the
Central Americans and the Chinese. They said the measure would
merely provide Central Americans hungry for American jobs with a
foot in the door.
   ``What we are going to do is grant a permanent status not to
people who came here for any political reason but for people who
came here for an economic reason to take jobs away from American
workers,'' said Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., a supporter of the measure, retorted
that the AFL-CIO and a number of large labor unions have endorsed
the measure. ``So evidently they aren't afraid,'' he told the House.
   Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., cited estimates that the price tag on
operation of the measure could reach $260 million over two years.
``I can tell you that my constituents will not abide by it,'' she
declared.
   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., said that illegal aliens who have
fled the three countries already are in the United States. ``I
think its in our interest to have Nicaraguans and Salvadorans
living in the open rather than maintaining an underground
existence,'' he said.
   ``This bill is the right thing to do,'' Rep. Bill Richardson,
D-N.M., told the House. He urged help for those ``uprooted for
political reasons, who have been escaping tragedy.''

   A neatly dressed man slugged Sen. John Glenn
in the jaw Wednesday shortly after watching him help plant a tree
outside the Smithsonian Institution, witnesses said.
   Glenn stopped the assailant by grabbing his arms, witnesses said.
   Michael Breen, 31, of Washington, was arrested and charged with
assaulting a member of Congress, which is a federal offense, said
District of Columbia Police Officer Quintin Peterson. Breen's
arraignment was set for Thursday in U.S. District Court, the
spokesman said.
   A Glenn aide said the senator's jaw was sore but he did not see
a doctor and kept to his schedule.
   Glenn's spokeswoman, Rebecca Bell, said the Ohio Democrat was
talking to a television reporter when ``this guy starts muttering,
`The earthquakes are starting, the earthquakes are starting.'''
   The man then ``comes up and socks'' Glenn on the jaw, she said.
The senator, a former astronaut and ex-Marine, grabbed the man and
called for Smithsonian guards.
   Gary Nurenberg, the TV reporter, said Glenn rubbed his jaw and
said, ``I haven't been hit like that in 30 years.'' Nurenberg, a
correspondent with Gillett News Bureau, said ``the senator at 68
had better reflexes than anybody else there.''
   The attack was captured on videotape.
   Nurenberg said the man told him last week's California
earthquake was a harbinger of imminent catastrophe in which
two-thirds of the world's population would be wiped out.
   ``He talked about the children of Fatima. He said the Pope is
withholding information,'' the reporter said. The man told
Nurenberg he hit Glenn to ``get attention.''
   Nurenberg said the man wore a coat, a tie and suspenders and
``looked to be a professional, yuppie type.''

<HEAD>Thai Official Confirms Major Khmer Rouge Victory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister said Wednesday
that Khmer Rouge guerrillas seized the strategic Cambodian town of
Pailin, a victory that could block the movement of government
troops and supplies to nearby cities.
   The Khmer Rouge said in a radio broadcast the seizure opened the
door for an assault on the city of Battambang, and it advised
government soldiers to leave the area ``in order to stay alive.''
   The guerrillas said they took Pailin, along the Thai border, on
Sunday after a two-year offensive.
   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand confirmed the
report and said the guerrillas also captured artillery guns, tanks
and ammunition stockpiles. He was the first Thai official to
confirm the guerrilla takeover.
   It could be a major victory for the Khmer Rouge in its war to
oust the government Vietnam installed after its 1978 invasion.
   Government soldiers had vowed to hold onto Pailin, which is
along Route 10 leading to the provincial capital of Battambang, 40
miles away. Battambang is Cambodia's largest city after the
capital, Phnom Penh.
   A Khmer Rouge Army broadcast said guerrillas routed the 196th
division, two brigades and three provincial regiments in their
two-day final offensive on Pailin.
   ``Pailin town has a very important strategic role for the
Vietnamese enemy and puppets, militarily, politically and
economically,'' it said. ``Particularly in the military aspect, it
is a strategic door directly relating to the survival of Battambang
town.''
   The broadcast said pro-Vietnamese forces face serious problems
trying to move soldiers and supplies to defend Route 10 and
Battambang.
   ``Parents and compatriots,'' it said, ``please call on your
children and husbands to quickly desert for home ... in order to
stay alive.
   ``What is the use of the remaining district and provincial units
fighting and dying?''
   The broadcast said some Vietnamese disguised as Cambodian
soldiers helped the Cambodian troops defend Pailin.
   Vietnam said it pulled the last of its soldiers from Cambodia
last month, but the guerrillas say thousands are still in the
country.
   The Vietnamese withdrawal raised fears the Cambodian army would
not be able to hold its own against the Khmer Rouge and the two
non-communist guerrilla groups, the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front and the army of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The Khmer
Rouge is the strongest of the coalition.
   Thai military sources said the Khmer Rouge killed 120 government
soldiers and captured 17 at Pailin.
   Siddhi, who spoke at a weekly news briefing, said neither the
Phnom Penh government nor the guerrillas is strong enough to win a
clear victory in the war. ``In the end they will have to compromise
and come back to negotiations,'' he said.
   Thailand is leading efforts to revive peace negotiations,
stalled since the failure of an international conference in Paris
in August.
   The main stumbling block was the Cambodian government's refusal
to agree to a government role for the Khmer Rouge, which massacred
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians in the 1970s before it was
ousted.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Holds First Plenum Since Soviet Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling party on Wednesday opened
its first plenum since the Soviet troop withdrawal and promoted to
the Central Committee several leading figures who opposed Moscow's
intervention in the Afghan war.
   Several rockets slammed into Kabul, killing six people.
   Four members of one family were killed when a missile crashed
through their house and exploded. Women stood in the courtyard of
the house wailing in mourning.
   Another rocket landed in the hills behind Kabul.
   The plenum was held amid tight security in deteriorating
government buildings in downtown Kabul. It elected 19 new full
members and one alternate to the policy-making Central Committee of
the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, a government
spokesman said. Two new members were also appointed to the
Politburo, the highest policy-making body in the country.
   A tank manned by several soldiers stood at one end of the street
near the meeting place. Dozens of troops patrolled the streets
nearby.
   The party changes were intended to unite the party and increase
support from the military, diplomats and an Afghan government
source said.
   President Najib addressed the meeting and said the party was
ready to unite with all ``progressive'' groups to achieve peace in
Afghanistan. It was the first full party meeting since October 1988.
   The Soviet-backed government is in the middle of a civil war
against U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. Although fighting appears
stalemated, the rebels control much of the countryside.
   Among the new Central Committee members are Karim Misaq and
Abdul Ghorbandi, both leading members of the ruling party's Khalq
faction, which opposed the Soviet military intervention in 1979.
   The intervention brought Khalq's opponent, the Parcham faction,
to power.
   The two factions have been bitter enemies since the 1960s.
Traditionally, Khalq, which means ``masses,'' had much support in
the military and Parcham, meaning ``flag,'' was popular among
intellectuals. Neither can claim much popular support.
   The Khalq group has long been critical of Moscow's military
presence in Afghanistan and blames Afghanistan's current plight on
the policies of the Parcham.
   Since the last Soviet troops withdrew in February, the party's
Parcham leadership, especially Najib, has sought to blunt such
criticism by bringing Khalq members into government.
   ``These moves are necessary to show the rebels that our ranks
are united,'' said a government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``We are showing that we have a strong party.''
   The official said the Parcham group was also bringing Khalq
people into the Central Commtttee because they need military
support. The Khalq group has strong military backing. It was the
military that put the Khalq faction in power in April 1978 when
officers loyal Khalq staged a Communist coup.
   Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to replace that
government with another, then stayed to help fight the guerrillas.
   Also appointed to the Central Committee were the secretaries of
several provincial party committees.
   Afghan guerrillas said they have scored more victories against
government forces in the past two weeks than at any time since the
Soviet troops left.
   Najibullah Lefrey, information minister in the rebels'
government-in-exile, made the claim in a news conference in
Islamabad, Pakistan. The guerrillas are based in Pakistan.
   This month, the guerrillas stopped a major army convoy that was
heading south from Kabul to supply troops defending Khost, an
eastern garrison town 90 miles away that has been under siege since
August.
   Lefrey said the air force then tried to drop supplies to Khost
by parachute but that many landed in guerrilla-controlled areas
nearby.

   A deaf teen-age girl who walked into a
school nervously seeking help was apparently kidnapped several
years ago and moved around the country, possibly by satanists, an
FBI agent said Wednesday.
   ``From some of the drawings she was able to provide, it is
believed that some of the people she was with since her abduction
may have been tied to the occult,'' FBI Agent Paul Cavanagh said.
   Authorities have had a hard time gathering information from the
frightened, confused girl, but she has given them drawings that
include symbols associated with satanism and indicated she may have
been abducted from a foster home in California, Cavanagh said.
   The girl showed up Sept. 18 at William B. Jack Elementary School
in Portland, identifying herself in sign language as Toby Cole.
   ``She just stopped at the counter. She walked in and signed a
little bit,'' said Judi Fox, a teacher's aide who called in a
teacher who speaks in sign language. The teacher realized the girl
needed help and took her to the Governor Baxter School for the Deaf
in nearby Falmouth, where authorities began questioning her.
   ``Over the next few weeks, Toby provided information which leads
us to believe that she is possibly the victim of a kidnapping
abduction,'' the FBI said in a statement issued by its Boston
office.
   ``Toby has indicated that she is not sure Toby Cole is her real
name, but is the name given to her by her abductors,'' the
statement said. ``She stated she believes she is 15 years of age
and possibly was born on Dec. 25, 1974. Toby seems to possess a
good vocabulary and is far ahead of children in her age bracket in
intelligence and communication skills.''
   Cavanagh said Wednesday from Boston that psychologists and
child-care experts dealing with the girl have pieced together
enough information to believe she was abducted from California
about three years ago, then moved several times, possibly into
Canada.
   ``She claims to have been abducted by a male out there who was
driving a van at the time,'' Cavanagh said. He said authorities had
no reason to doubt the girl's story, but had found no missing
person reports matching her.
   ``We did receive a communication on it,'' Supervisory Special
Agent Susan Schnitzer in San Francisco said Wednesday. ``Anything
we're requested by the Boston division to do, we'll be doing.''
   Ms. Schnitzer declined further comment.
   Falmouth police Lt. Michael Bouchard said Wednesday that his
department had received numerous calls, but had no immediate leads
on the girl's family or any suspects in her abduction.
   Authorities said the girl was in the care of the Maine
Department of Human Services. ``She's in a safe place in the
state,'' Bouchard said. ``She's comfortable. She's being taken care
of.''
   Cavanagh said authorities believed the girl had been abused, but
he did not think she had been emotionally able to undergo physical
tests that would determine whether she had been sexually abused.
   The elementary teacher who was able to sign with the girl said
Wednesday she took her to the Baxter School because the girl
quickly indicated she needed help.
   ``I realized she was a deaf person in a hearing environment, and
she would do better in a deaf environment,'' Ann Marie
Papi-Stratton said.
   Ms. Papi-Stratton declined to say what the girl told her.
   At the Baxter School, superintendent Kathleen Fries said she had
been advised by authorities and her superiors not to discuss
specifics of the case.
   The principal of Jack Elementary, Myrt Collins, said employees
who saw the girl described her as ``frightened and anxious,''
although there was nothing unusual about her appearance or dress.
   The FBI statement on the girl described her as a caucasian,
about 5 feet tall and 105 pounds, with blond or light brown wavy
hair and blue eyes.

   A panel of rural appraisers says farmland
values are expected to continue rising in 1990, but at a much
slower rate than this year, the Agriculture Department reported
Wednesday.
   Based on a survey made in early August, farmland prices are
likely to rise an average 3.5 percent by August, 1990. That would
be about half the 6.5 percent increase reported for 1988-89.
   One reason suggested by appraisers for the slow-down is a drop
in corn and soybean prices from the drought-levels of last year.
But higher wheat prices probably are helping support some values,
particularly in the Great Plains.
   A group of about 500 appraisers is checked quarterly by a
University of Wisconsin survey laboratory for the department's
Economic Research Service, said analyst Roger Hexem, author of the
report.
   Hexem said in a telephone interview that the year-ahead estimate
by appraisers was ``somewhat lower than we have been forecasting''
within the agency. The information is being reviewed and will be
considered when USDA issues its next farmland forecast late in
November.
   The report said appraisers expect land values to rise the
fastest in the North Central region, up 4.8 percent during the
1989-90, compared with a 9.5 percent increase reported in 1988-89.
   No state estimates were included in the report.
   ``While corn and soybean prices remain relatively high compared
with recent years, current prices are lower than last year and may
have contributed to the less-optimistic outlook,'' the report said.
``In contrast, high and rising wheat prices are llikely providing
strength to the region's land values.''
   In the South, appraisers expect land values to increase an
average of 2.7 percent in 1989-90, compared with 5.5 percent the
previous 12 months.
   ``Principal factors behind the 2.7 percent increase expected in
the South are commodity price movements, lower interest rates and
improving farm incomes,'' the report said. ``During the past year,
the appraisers said high commodity prices, government programs and
favorable weather contributed to higher farmland values in the
South.''
   Farmland in the West was forecast by appraisers to appreciate
about 3 percvent, compared with 4.1 percent in 1988-89.
   ``High commodity prices, including cattle, and stronger demand
by non-agricultural investors are the most frequently cited factors
behind the increases,'' the report said.
   Values in the Northeast are expected to rise an average of 1.4
percent in 1989-90, compared with 2.8 percent the previous year.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said Wednesday his country is determined to maintain
friendly relations with Poland's Communists and with the
non-Communists leading the government.
   ``I think it is an interesting period and obviously this
situation deserves introducing some corrections,'' the chief Soviet
diplomat said when asked about the current state of Soviet-Polish
relations.
   ``First of all we have to rebuild the mechanisms of economic
relations and increase the effectiveness of our cooperation,'' he
said, without elaborating.
   A joint communique said both sides agreed mutual problems should
be solved on the basis of the principles of freedom of choice and
non-intervention in internal affairs.
   Shevardnadze is the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit
Poland since the election to prime minister Aug. 24 of Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, the East bloc's first non-communist prime minister.
After meeting with him Tuesday, Shevardnadze announced Mazowiecki
will visit Moscow next month.
   Shevardnadze demonstrated Moscow's apparent openness to Polish
pluralism Wednesday when he invited Adam Michnik, a top Solidarity
editor and former political prisoner, to join him for part of a
session with Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   Afterward, Shevardnadze declared he is willing to meet with
``every party, with anybody.''
   Michnik, editor in chief of the pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza
daily and one of Poland's keenest observers of Soviet affairs, was
the only journalist ushered into the Central Committee conference
room. They talked for about 10 minutes before Shevardnadze came out
and spoke with other reporters.
   The Soviet government has said it views the radical changes in
Poland as internal political matters. Shevardnadze said the Soviet
Union is determined to maintain friendly relations with the new
Solidarity-led coalition government as well as with Poland's
Communist Party.
   Speaking of ``blanks spots'' in Polish-Soviet history, such as
the massacre of Polish soldiers on Soviet soil during World War II,
Shevardnadze said they would be cleared up.
   ``We want only the truth. It is needed by our two nations and is
in the interest of friendship,'' he said.
   The joint communique said both sides had ``confirmed the will to
explain some problems and history of Polish-Soviet relations.
Quickening of these works is in the interest of both sides.''
   The most important is the massacre of nearly 4,500 Polish
officers at the Katyn Forest in World War II. A Polish commission
has traced responsibility to Soviet secret police, but there has
been no response from the Soviets.
   Asked what the limits to Soviet tolerance of changes in Poland
are, Shevardnadze said, ``We don't set up order in other countries.
Would you want it to be so?''
   The meeting with Rakowski was followed by a meeting with
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, a Communist. They embraced warmly
and posed for photographers before beginning private discussions.
   During talks with new Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski on
Tuesday, Shevardnadze pledged that the Soviet Union will maintain
crucial deliveries of oil and raw materials to Poland, its largest
economic partner in the East bloc.
   Moscow provides nearly 85 percent of Poland's crude oil, 65
percent of its processed petroleum products, and 72 percent of its
iron ore.
   Shevardnadze told the official PAP news agency his country is
interested in an intensification of economic relations with Poland.
``Cooperation is simply necessary because the Soviet and Polish
economies are complimentary to each other in many spheres,'' he
said.
   Shevardnadze said trade with Poland represents about 10 percent
of his country's total foreign trade, while the Soviet Union
receives about one-third of Polish trade.
   Both countries are in the midst of economic crisis, but the new
Polish government has made a firm commitment to introduce a market
economy and is seeking to renegotiate its contacts with its East
bloc trading partners.

<HEAD>South Korea To Announce Controversial Jet Deal in November</HEAD>

   South Korea plans to purchase 120 U.S. jet
fighters under a co-production agreement that one senator predicts
will spark a ``bitter brawl'' between Congress and the
administration, officials said Wednesday.
   South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon has informed Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney that the Seoul government will announce its
choice between two U.S. fighters early next month, said Pentagon
sources.
   Cheney was told of the decision during a courtesy call at the
Pentagon last week, said the sources, who spoke on condition of not
being identified by name.
   Lee was in Washington during the visit of South Korean President
Roh Tae Woo.
   The South Koreans will choose between the F@A-18 Hornet, built
by the McDonnell Douglas Corp., or the F-16 Falcon built by General
Dynamics Corp., in order to modernize their fleet of aging F-5
fighters.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., an opponent of the co-production plan,
said through an aide on Wednesday that the deal could be worth $1.8
billion to $3 billion.
   The aide said Dixon foresees a ``bitter, bitter brawl'' between
Congress and the Bush administration over the plan and contends it
will cost U.S. jobs and harm American aerospace and aviation
industries.
   The senator plans to offer a resolution in the Senate to express
disapproval of the deal ``as soon as it is official,'' said the
aide, who asked not to be identified by name.
   The Koreans proposed to buy 12 fighters off-the-shelf from U.S.
manufacturers, assemble 36 from U.S.-supplied kits and then build
72 on their own, an arrangement that has been accepted by U.S.
negotiators.
   Pentagon spokesman Navy Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist confirmed
that U.S. and Korean negotiators ``have agreed to a 12-36-72 mix.''
   Lundquist said 12 aircraft will be fully built in the United
States, 36 will be assembled in South Korea from imported parts and
72 planes will be built in South Korea under the licensed
co-production agreement.
   ``A significant portion of the co-produced aircraft will be
produced in the United States ... At least 70 percent of the
program's value will be spent in the United States,'' he said.
   During a visit to the Pentagon in July, Lee said the decision on
the purchase of the 120 fighters was to be announced in September.
   Cheney said after that July session that he preferred the
Koreans purchase the planes ready-made by U.S. manufacturers, but
added that the final agreement would ``probably be some blend'' of
outright purchase and co-production.
   The defense secretary added that he was pleased the Koreans had
decided to purchase U.S. planes over those of other nations.

<TEXT>
   Egypt's top security official denied
lawyers' assertions Wednesday that U.S. rather than Egyptian
investigators uncovered a terror group charged with attacking
American and Israeli diplomats.
   The defense lawyers' goal appeared to be to embarrass Interior
Minister Zaki Badr and the government.
   Badr's rare appearance on a state security court subpoena was to
elicit testimony on the investigation of 20 alleged members of an
organization calling itself Egypt's Revolution.
   The defendants are charged with murder, attempted murder and
criminal complicity in four shootings between 1984 and 1987 that
killed two Israeli diplomats and wounded six Israelis and two U.S.
diplomats.
   All 20 defendants were present except Khaled Abdel Nasser,
eldest son of the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser. He is
reportedly living in Yugoslavia.
   Badr's ministry handles Egypt's internal security.
   During his 70-minute testimony, Badr denied repeatedly that
defendant Essam Nour el-Din went to the U.S. Embassy in Cairo in
1987 to confess and was questioned there for more than two weeks
before being surrendered to Egyptian authorities.
   Defense attorneys contended that before the Americans gave them
Nour el-Din, Badr's investigators had no clue to the terrorist
group, whose attacks had greatly embarrassed the government.
   ``Essam Nour el-Din told state security authorities that he had
information about these cases in the middle of August 1987,'' Badr
told the court. ``Authorities checked his story and made their
investigations.''
   Defense lawyer Adel Amin alleged that President Hosni Mubarak
formed a committee, which included Badr, to investigate Egypt's
Revolution on the basis of information from the U.S. Embassy
centering on Nour el-Din's statements.
   ``I am sure that no decision was ever made to create such a
committee. Therefore I could not possibly have been a member of
it,'' Badr said.
   After Badr left, Nour el-Din testified that he went to the U.S.
Embassy and made statements to officials there.
   Embassy spokeswoman Marcelle Wahba refused comment on the two
men's testimony.
   Amin cited purportedly official papers to show that Nour el-Din
went to the embassy Aug. 15, 1987, and that security authorities
were informed of the case Sept. 6. Nevertheless, Amin said,
defendant Khaled Abdel Nasser was able to leave Egypt on Sept. 10.
   ``When someone makes an accusation, just an accusation, should I
prevent people from traveling abroad without my having proof and
without going through the judicial authorities?'' Badr responded.
   The prosecution has demanded the death penalty for 11
defendants, including Nasser, who was charged with murder,
attempted murder, undermining Egypt's national security and
damaging its relations with Israel and the United States.
   The remaining nine, among them a nephew of President Nasser, are
charged with complicity and could be sentenced to prison terms of
up to 25 years.
   Eleven defendants are in custody. The rest are free on bail.

<HEAD>Aministration Complains to Moscow About Arms Shipped to Salvadoran
Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration complained to Moscow
on Wednesday that Nicaragua is still shipping Soviet-bloc arms to
Salvadoran rebels, despite repeated Soviet and Nicaraguan denials.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, citing the seizure of a
truckload of weapons on the Nicaraguan-Hondran border, called the
continued shipments ``a major problem.''
   ``We've had an extended dialogue with the Soviet Union about the
importance of using their influence to stop that kind of
activity,'' Baker said.
   At the same time, President Bush extended for another six months
a U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua first imposed by President
Reagan in mid-1985.
   In a statement announcing the renewal of the sanctions, Bush
said the Central American nation continues to pose ``an unusual and
extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy of the
United States.''
   Bush must report to Congress twice a year on the status of the
embargo and on U.S.-Nicaraguan relations.
   The developments came as Bush prepared for a visit to Costa
Rica, where he and 17 other heads of state _ including Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega _ will join in festivities marking 100
years of Costa Rican democracy.
   Baker, briefing reporters on Bush's trip, said the president
would not meet with Ortega during the two-day visit that begins
Friday.
   He cited continued clandestine shipments by Oretga's Sandinista
government of East-bloc arms to leftist Salvadoran rebels as one
reason why a Bush-Ortega meeting would be ``inappropriate''
   ``Nicaragua clearly continues to ship arms'' to the
anti-government rebels, Baker said.
   ``It is a major problem that we have called to the attention of
the Soviet Union, and called to their attention as recently as
today,'' Baker said.
   Asked whether the apparent continued shipments undermine Soviet
credibility, Baker said: ``It is a major stumbling block.''
   The Soviets have denied any knowledge of the shipments.
   The Honduran military last Wednesday seized what officials
called a record shipment of weapons being sent from Nicaragua
through Hondurus to rebels in El Salvador.
   The State Department says the captured weaponry includes 20 AKM
assault rifles, with 13 of Soviet manufacture. The remainder were
made in other Soviet-bloc countries.
   The cargo also reportedly included more than 300 rifle grenades,
800 mortar shells, large quantities of Soviet-made hand grenades,
50 other assault weapons or machine guns, large quantities of
ammunition, explosives and military radios, according to the State
Department. Much of the equipment was wrapped in Nicaraguan
newspapers.
   Also included with the weapons were instruction booklets with
``FMLN'' on the cover, the letters of the Spanish-language name of
the Salvadoran ``liberation'' effort.
   Salvadoran government officials have told the State Department
that the truck was registered in the name of a ``known FMLN front
group,'' U.S. officials said.
   ``At the very least, the government of Nicaragua is not doing
what they are telling the Soviet Union, based on what the Soviet
Union tells us,'' Baker told reporters.
   Noting that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had
recently visited Nicaragua, Baker said: ``It would appear to me the
Nicaraguans are telling them one thing and doing something else,''
Baker said.
   The Bush administration wants to see Ortega's government voted
out of office in the election next Feb. 25, and contends that
election preparations unfairly benefit the ruling Sandinistas.
   Bush, in his six-month report to Congress on the status of the
Nicaragua embargo, said ``the trade sanctions are an essential
element of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in Nicaragua
by diplomatic means.''
   The embargo bars imports from Nicaragua and bans U.S. exports to
that country except to support the Contra rebels fighting the
leftist Sandinista government. It also prohibits Nicaraguan
aircraft or boats from entering the United States.

   The Japan Professional Baseball Association said
Wednesday it is donating $100,000 from proceeds from Japan's
version of the World Series to victims of the earthquake in
California.
   In its announcement, the association noted that former President
Ronald Reagan, now visiting Japan, had thrown out the ceremonial
first pitch at Game 3 of the Japan Series on Tuesday.
   As Reagan entered the field, a public address system announcer
asked the audience to make donations to U.S. quake victims ``in
order to promote U.S.-Japanese relations.''
   In the best-of-seven Japan Series, the Pacific League champion
Kintetsu Buffaloes led the Central League champion Yomiuri Giants
three games to one after the Giants' 5-0 victory Wednesday.
   Many people in Japan, which also is subject to devastating
earthquakes, received their first word of the California disaster
as they tuned in to watch a live satellite broadcast of Game 3 of
the World Series from San Francisco on Oct. 17.

<HEAD>September Home Sales Hit Highest Level This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes, responding to lower
interest rates, climbed 4.3 percent in September to the highest
level this year, a real estate trade group said Wednesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63
million units last month following a 4.5 percent sales increase in
August.
   Analysts credited lower mortgage rates for the back-to-back
monthly increases in sales, with the lower rates meaning families
that had been priced out of the market when rates were rising
earlier in the year can now afford homes.
   At the end of last week, fixed-rate mortgages had dipped back
below 10 percent, averaging 9.92 percent, according to a weekly
survey conducted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Last
spring, mortgage rates hit a peak of 11.22 percent, reflecting a
year-long effort on the part of the Federal Reserve to push rates
higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures.
   With signs that inflation was easing, the Fed has relented and
has been nudging rates lower in response to signs of sluggish
economic growth.
   ``Many people who were forced to put off trading up or entering
the market earlier this year are making their move now,'' said Ira
Gribin, president of the Realtors association. ``With mortgage
rates lower during the second half of the year than the first, the
market is reaching a broader income range of buyers.''
   The national median price for an existing single-family home
fell from August to September by $1,400 to $93,400. The median, or
mid-point, price was still 5.5 percent higher than it was a year
ago.
   Analysts attributed the one-month price drop in large part to
the fact that the market in September shifts away from larger
families to smaller households buying smaller homes.
   Regionally, the sales advance was paced by a 12.7 percent
increase in the West, where homes were sold at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 620,000 units in September.
   Sales were up 3.7 percent in the South to an annual rate of 1.40
million units, while sales rose 1 percent in the Midwest to an
annual rate of 990,000 units.
   Sales were unchanged in the Northeast at 590,000 units. This is
down 9.2 percent from a year ago. Home sales in the Northeast have
been in a slump this year because surging home costs have priced
many buyers out of the market.
   But John Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors, said that
sales in the Northeast have come back slightly from a low-point
reached in June and appear to be stabilizing at the current sales
pace.
   ``Housing markets appear to be firming up across the board. We
expect that the lower mortgage rates this fall will keep boosting
sales in the moderate-price range,'' Tuccillo said.
   The most expensive housing market in September was the
Northeast, where a median-priced home went for $144,800, followed
by the West at $144,300. The median sales price in the South was
$84,200 while the Midwest offered the cheapest housing with a
median price of $71,800 in September.
   The national sales pace of 3.63 million units was the fastest
clip since homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.92 million units last December.

   Scientists, marine enforcement and
Florida businesses are pulling together to save the manatee from
boaters in a campaign keyed to the mammal's endangered status:
``Miss her now or miss her forever.''
   ``I think the slogan has really got a message,'' Vi Stewart of
the state Department of Natural Resources marine research
laboratory said Wednesday. ``It's very significant, but you've got
to think about it. It doesn't jump out and grab you like `where's
the beef?'''
   Marine experts estimate there are probably 1,200 West Indian
manatees left in the United States, down from as many as an
estimated 10,000 a few decades ago. Almost all are in Florida's
coastal waters.
   So far this year through September, 125 have died in Florida, 41
after being struck by boats or barges. Last year 113 deaths were
recorded.
   Aiming to slow this record-setting pace, a multimedia
advertising blitz is planned for the time of year when the gentle
giant is most vulnerable to boaters.
   As the temperature drops and the water cools, the lumbering sea
cows move into warmer waters near springs or thermal discharges of
power plants, thus increasing the risk of contact with boaters.
   ``The next six months is the most critical time for the
manatee,'' said Ralph Campbell, president of HLA Advertising and
Public Relations of Tampa, which donated work on the campaign and
came up with the slogan.
   The state Cabinet is recommending posting speed limits for boats
and the licensing of operators in a two-fold effort to reduce
boat-related deaths and to protect manatees.
   Florida has 711,000 registered boats. The state had 105
boating-related deaths last year.
   Gov. Bob Martinez and the Cabinet also voted Tuesday to require
13 counties where the manatees are concentrated to decide within 60
days whether to immpose countywide speed limits or adopt more
specific plans.

   Sixth-graders and street people shared
quarters Wednesday as the upscale Marina Middle School reopened for
classes even though a Red Cross shelter for 175 earthquake victims
remained in the gym and cafeteria.
   On a sunny morning, students played basketball in the yard while
a few feet away scruffy-looking street people walked between
temporary metal barricades to breakfast. One man washed his hair
using canned water. There was no contact between the mismatched
schoolmates.
   Red Cross officials estimated about half the homeless were
displaced residents of the affluent area, while the other half
permanently lived on the streets.
   Some of the fresh-faced students were upset that the homeless
were still in the building more than a week after the Oct. 17
quake, even though security is heavy and segregation nearly total.
   ``It might be disturbing the students,'' said student Kevin Wong
as he headed into classes.
   A student who wouldn't give his name said some children feel
they have sacrificed enough by giving up a week of classes so the
victims could be housed.
   With the cafeteria turned over to the homeless, students have to
bring bag lunches. Wednesday morning the cafeteria featured an
obscenity-filled screaming match between two street people, who had
to be separated by security guards. Outside in the yard lay a
bundle of filthy clothes.
   ``It's sort of wierd,'' said one girl, who school officials
would not allow to give her name. ``We can't get to the gym.''
   But administrators said they were happy to help.
   ``These are people who need the help,'' said Assistant Principal
Norm Sui. ``Things are going fine.''
   He estimated 90 percent of the 950 students were back in
classes, in grades six, seven and eight.
   The school stay was a trip back in time for retired army nurse
Mabel Doss, whose nearby apartment was heavily damaged by the quake.
   ``It's amazing how much you've grown when you come back to sit
in these little seats,'' Ms. Doss said as she ate a breakfast of a
banana, orange slices and a turnover.
   ``This is better food than I've been eating,'' said Rick
Marshall, who said he normally lives on the street.
   ``I think there's a spirit that exists in the gymnasium here,''
he said. ``There's a lot of emotional support and hugging.''
   Red Cross officials say the shelter will remain open as long as
people need it.

<HEAD>Banking Committee To Look At Drug-Money Laundering in Southwest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee will hold hearings
in Texas to examine why the Southwest is reportedly ``awash with
drug monies'' being laundered through banks in the region, Chairman
Henry B. Gonzalez announced Wednesday.
   Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, said the hearings would be conducted
in his hometown of San Antonio Dec. 6 and 7 to examine the growing
problem of money laundering in the Southwest and whether current
banking laws are adequate.
   ``Recent reports show that more cash is flowing into certain
Southwest financial institutions than is being withdrawn,''
Gonzalez said in a statement. ``Such an influx of cash _
particularly in small bills _ is often an indication that the
deposit is the result of an illegal drug sale.''
   Gonzalez cited a story in the Austin American-Statesman that
said the cash surplus in the San Antonio vault of the Federal
Reserve rose from $900 million in 1986 to $1.6 billion in 1988.
   ``Only the Federal Reserve Banks in Miami, Los Angeles and
Jacksonville, Fla., have larger cash surpluses,'' Gonzalez said.
   Gonzalez said his committee would ask officials on the ``front
lines in the war against drugs'' to discuss the extent of the drug
problem and money laundering in the Southwest and how local and
state law enforcement agencies are cordinating their efforts with
federal agencies.
   Witnesses would also be called from the Border Patrol, Drug
Enforcement Administration, Customs Service and Internal Revenue
Service, Gonzalez said, as the committee attempts to assess the
federal government's effectiveness in combatting money laundering
activities.
   The role of financial institutions would also be examined.
   ``When Congress passed the Omnibus Drug Initiative Act of 1988,
the Banking Committee made sure that the bill contained strong
language designed to prevent our nation's banks from being used as
Laudromats to launder the ill-gotten gains of drug dealers,''
Gonzalez said.
   Gonzalez said the hearings would look at the role of
international bankers in combatting money laundering, and would
examine international money trasnfer systems, and attempt to
estimate the volume of illegal drug funds worldwide.

   Billey fought in the war with the creator of the cartoon, which

   Billey, a sergeant, died Tuesday at Muskogee Veterans
Administration Medical Center. He retired from the U.S. Army
Ammunition Plant in McAlester.
   ``He had lots of sides to him, this guy. He was my guru. He
taught me about the army and how to get along in the infantry
too,'' said Bill Mauldin, the cartoon's creator.
   The cartoon portrayed U.S. soldiers making often irreverent
comments about their status in the war effort.
   ``He sort of took me under his wing,'' Mauldin said of his
wartime service in the infantry with Billey. ``He was a tough,
seasoned old soldier. And a decent man, a man who killed because it
was what he had to do, not because he wanted to.''

<HEAD>Former Labor Secretary Named Mediator for Coal Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Labor Secretary W.J. Usery Jr. on
Wednesday stepped into the fray between the Pittston Co. and 1,700
striking miners as the government's super mediator, saying he hopes
to provide ``different ideas, different everything'' to bring an
end to the 7-month-old walkout.
   Usery, tapped by current Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to
intervene in the three-state strike, admitted initial reluctance to
do so because of the acrimony between the two sides, which haven't
bargained directly with one another since the walkout began in
April.
   ``This is one that you didn't jump at so quick,'' said Usery, a
veteran mediator who served as labor secretary in the final year of
the Ford administration.
   Still, he said he would get to work immediately and hoped a
settlement could be reached by the holidays. He did not say whether
he meant Thanksgiving or Christmas.
   Mrs. Dole said the decision to appoint a ``super mediator'' was
not a sign of disappointment with the federal mediators currently
involved in the negotiations. But she said her recent visit with
Pittston strikers and her three-way meeting with company Chairman
Paul Douglas and United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka had
convinced her of the need to name a mediator of greater stature.
   ``I believe that Bill Usery is precisely the right person,'' she
told reporters.
   Added Usery: ``There comes a time that the parties themselves,
the process, needs an additional thrust, needs someone else, needs
a different voice, different suggestions, different ideas,
different everything. I hope that I'm the person who can bring this
to a stop.''
   A spokeswoman for Pittston Coal Group, Susan Copeland, said
that, ``although we have not worked with Mr. Usery in the past, his
integrity and reputation for fairness are very well known and we
look forward to working closely with him.''
   She said the company resisted the union's efforts to get Usery
involved earlier this year ``because we felt at that time that all
other bargaining possibilities had not been exhausted.''
   Trumka, in a statement, said Usery ``is familiar with the
industry, has an intimate knowledge of the significance of the
issues involved and possesses a reputation for fairness and
impartiality. A better choice for mediator could not have been
made.'' Trumka urged daily, face-to-face bargaining sessions.
   Usery said he had been in touch with Pittson, which had objected
to a union request several months ago that Usery be asked to
mediate the dispute.
   ``They called and assured me that they would give me their full
cooperation and were hopeful that a resolution would be found,'' he
said.
   Usery said he would begin private, separate discussions
Wednesday with the principals in the dispute and hoped to arrange a
face-to-face meeting soon.
   ``We'll be working at it quite rapidly,'' he said, adding that
marathon bargaining sessions were possible once he was up to speed
on the issues. Health benefits, particularly those paid to
pensioners, have been the major issue dividing the company and its
miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   Since leaving government, Usery has headed a Washington labor
relations firm that bears his name. Among the dozens of major
strike he has mediated were a six-month strike by the United Auto
Workers against Deere &amp; Co. in 1987 and a three-week strike by
Chicago teachers in 1983.
   The Hardwick, Ga., native was appointed assistant secretary of
labor in 1969 and headed the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service from 1973 until Ford tapped him for the Cabinet post in
1976.

   Associated Press correspondent Terry
Anderson's fifth birthday as a captive in Lebanon should refocus
public attention on the plight of Western hostages in the Middle
East, members of Congress said Wednesday.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole and Reps. Paul Henry, R-Mich., and
Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, called on Americans to observe Anderson's
42nd birthday Friday. They recommended wearing yellow ribbons,
ringing church bells at noon, praying for the hostages' release and
observing a moment of silence at sporting events.
   ``They will not and should not be forgotten,'' Dole, R-Kan.,
said at a Capitol news conference. ``We're asking ... that we take
action to symbolize our dedication toward winning their release.''
   Henry sponsored a congressional resolution to designate Friday
as National Hostage Awareness Day, which President Bush signed into
law Monday.
   Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, was siezed
March 16, 1985, and is the longest held of eight Americans being
held in Lebanon.
   The lawmakers declined to discuss the U.S. government's handling
of the hostage situation or statements made this week by Iranian
President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Islamic Jihad, a
pro-Iranian group holding at least two hostages.
   Rafsanjani told reporters he was in no hurry to improve
relations with the United States and gave no hint that his
government was pushing to gain the hostages' release. Islamic Jihad
reiterated its offer to swap Anderson and hostage Thomas Sutherland
for 15 Shiite Moslems jailed in Kuwait.
   ``We're trying to avoid injecting ourselves into some of the
political and policy'' matters, Henry said. ``The focus of this is
what are we in America doing to keep this situation before us.''
   Former hostages have said their spirits were bolstered by public
observances on their behalf, which they managed to hear about
despite their isolation, Henry said.
   Relatives of the hostages and former hostages will be among the
participants in a Catholic ``Mass of Hope'' Friday at Georgetown
University in Washington, said Carmella LaSpada, spokeswoman for No
Greater Love, a hostage support group.
   Besides Anderson and Sutherland, the other U.S. hostages are
Frank H. Reed, Joseph J. Cicippio, Edwin A. Tracy, Jessee J.
Turner, Alann B. Steen and Robert B. Polhill.

<HEAD>Alliance Voices Concern over Soviet Short-range Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers urged the
Soviets on Wednesday to reduce their short-range nuclear arsenal
and cautioned the West against dropping its guard because of the
democratic trend in Eastern Europe.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney of the United States and the other
defense chiefs welcomed Moscow's offer of unilateral cuts in
conventional forces, but said those would have little effect on the
Warsaw Pact's nuclear capabilities.
   In a statement ending a two-day semiannual meeting of the
Western alliance's Nuclear Planning Group, the ministers ``called
again on the Soviet Union to reduce unilaterally its short-range
missile systems to current NATO levels.''
   They said the Soviets maintained a ``massive superiority'' in
short-range nuclear weapons by updating their systems.
   Cheney told reporters afterward: ``The Soviet Union still
possesses enormous military capability. Their strategic capability
is more robust today than it was when Gorbachev came to power.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev became Communist Party chief in
March 1985.
   The NATO ministers said the alliance's nuclear warheads in
Western Europe had been reduced by more than one-third since 1979
to the lowest level in more than 20 years.
   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450
short-range missile launchers in Europe. NATO has 88 Lance
launchers, most of them in West Germany.
   Gorbachev has promised to withdraw 500 short-range nuclear
weapons from Europe this year.
   Two days after Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze admitted
the disputed Krasnoyarsk radar in Siberia violates the 1972
anti-ballistic missile treaty, the ministers welcomed the Soviet
offer to dismantle it.
   Their statement stressed ``the importance of full compliance
with arms control agreements'' and said NATO looked forward ``to
the prompt and full implementation of this commitment'' on
Krasnoyarsk.
   About democratic reforms spreading through Eastern Europe,
Cheney said ``there is great uncertainty about how events will
unfold in the Soviet Union'' and cautioned against a ``euphoric
attitude.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked in Washington
about Shevardnadze's proposal this week during a speech to Soviet
legislators of negotiations on disbanding NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Fitzwater replied:
   ``We don't have a position on their idea. We think NATO is
important. We expect the NATO pact to be in existence for some
time. Otherwise, we don't have any comment.''
   Defense Minister Tom King of Britain said the 16-member NATO
alliance was ``even more important now, at this time of manifest
change in the Warsaw Pact and in the Soviet Union itself.'' He said
Western defense efforts were ``no obstacle at all to improved
East-West relations.''
   All 16 NATO nations attended the Portugal meeting except France,
which does not belong to the alliance's integrated military
structure. Iceland, which has no armed forces, was present as an
observer.

   Napa Valley vintner Daryl Sattui feels
contempt for the thief who stole his wine after it fell from a
truck whose driver was among those killed in the collapsed Oakland
freeway.
   ``Perhaps I can see people stealing something, but when they're
stealing under those circumstances, I can think that even a thief
might not stoop to do it,'' said Sattui, whose great-grandfather,
Vittorio, started making wine in 1885. Today, none of the Sattui
wine is sold in stores, only at the winery and by subscription.
   In a rented truck, driver Gary K. Watson of Napa was northbound
on the lower roadway of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway when the
quake hit. His cargo, headed for shipment to customers, was 70
nine-liter cases of wine from the V. Sattui Winery in St. Helena.
   Neither Sattui nor most of the people from the winery personally
knew Watson, who was a temporary hire for the upcoming holiday
season.
   Watson's truck was crushed and Watson was killed along with at
least 38 others. But four plastic-foam-packed cases of Sattui wine,
some of it the $100-a-bottle 1981 cabernet sauvignon reserve,
plummeted 40 feet to the street.
   For six days, the surviving bottles sat on the street, skirted
by rescue workers in the desperate search for survivors from the
pancaked tons of concrete and twisted steel. At one point they were
gathered and stacked neatly under the freeway, out of the way.
   They had become an eloquent symbol of priorities amid the death
and destruction. Rescuers looked at the wine, but nobody touched it.
   ``I ain't thinking about it at all, much less taking it or
drinking it,'' a man said the night of the earthquake. ``Besides,
it would be wrong, real wrong, to take anything from this horrible
place that ain't yours.''
   On the seventh day, Monday, somebody stole the bottles.
   ``Makes my skin crawl,'' rescue worker Warner Brown told the San
Francisco Chronicle. ``Whoever got it, he can have it. ... I bet
some guy thought about that nice wine all week ... temptation
finally just got the better of his sense. Deep down, he doesn't
really want that wine.''

<TEXT>
   After years of insisting that his name be
welded to a law requiring sharp cuts in the federal deficit, Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings wants a divorce from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
deficit reduction act.
   ``I want a divorce because they are using the law as a shield to
hide behind, instead of as a sword to spur us in the right
direction,'' the South Carolina Democrat said in an interview
Wednesday.
   ``I want a divorce on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable
differences,'' he said, abandoning his once-strong campaign to make
sure the legislation was referred to as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
instead of just Gramm-Rudman.
   Hollings accused his partners in shaping the act, Sens. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, of succumbing to a numbers
game in which figures are shifted from column to column, the budget
debate is dominated by smoke and mirrors, and the defict goes up,
not down.
   ``I think that's blasphemy,'' he said. ``I need a divorce.''
   Hollings said that the process actually worked in the first two
years after the passage of the defict reduction bill in 1985.
   ``We cut $11.3 billion,'' he said.
   But then, Hollings said, an agreement between Congress and the
White House ``started the monkeyshines and the subterfuge.''
   ``It was a game of `anything you can do, I can do better,'' he
said.
   ``And we know it's fraudulent.''
   Hollings accused Gramm of arguing for truth in budgeting while
at the same time ``leading the pack'' on the Senate floor to take
the bailout of the faltering savings and loan industry out of the
budget process.
   Hollings complained of the use of other ``tricks and dodges'' to
avoid the money bite in the law he helped create.
   For example, he said that a savings of $2.9 billion was claimed
by moving a payday at the Pentagon to Sept. 29 from Oct. 1, placing
it in the 1989 fiscal year instead of the current 1990 fiscal year.
   For a while, he said, the annual deficit actually did turn
modestly downward.
   ``Now we're going up and up; we're not even going in the right
direction,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union has been given the go-ahead
to buy up to 16 million metric tons of U.S. grain in the year that
began Oct. 1, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   John B. Campbell, acting undersecretary for international
affairs and commodity programs, said the clearance to buy more
grain resulted from recent communication between the two countries.
   Under a long-term grain supply agreement, which began its
seventh year on Oct. 1, the Soviets are committed to buy at least 9
million tons of wheat and corn each year, with a maximum of 12
million tons allowed without further consultations.
   If more than 12 million tons are desired, the United States must
give its approval.
   So far in the 1989-90 year, the Soviets have bought 7.87 million
tons of corn, 143,700 tons of soybeans and 430,000 tons of soybean
meal. No wheat has been sold yet for delivery in 1989-90, but the
agreement specifies that at least 4 million tons must be purchased.
   Last year the Soviets bought a record of more than 21.7 million
tons of U.S. grain, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.

   President Bush and the three major commercial
television networks unveiled plans Wednesday to air episodes on
``The Cosby Show'' and other popular programs in the hope of
getting viewers to volunteer in the fight against hunger and
homelessness.
   The president, surrounded by television stars and network
executives at the White House, warmly applauded the initiative.
   ``The days when TV and the movies glorified violence and drugs
and crime are fading,'' the president declared. ``And in place of
these negative images, we're seeing a more positive message of
caring, of compassion and of hope.''
   The networks _ ABC, NBC and CBS _ have agreed to air during the
first three weeks of December at least two episodes of six major
shows devoted to hunger, homelessness and other problems that
volunteers can tackle.
   The shows, in addition to ``The Cosby Show,'' include
``Cheers,'' ``Murder She Wrote,'' ``Head of the Class,''
``Thirtysomething'' and ``Designing Women.''
   At the end of each show, viewers will be invited to call a toll
telephone number to receive for a $2 charge a guide to volunteering
as well as the phone number of a volunteer center in the caller's
area. The United Way and other organizations are also participating
in the project, dubbed ``Prime Time to End Hunger.''
   ``In that book, you can find what you can do, where you can go
and how you can help,'' said Khristyne Haje of ``Head of the
Class,'' one of five performers who joined Bush on stage in the
Rose Garden.
   ``It's time _ prime time _ to end hunger and drug abuse and
homelessness,'' declared Bush.
   ``Television provides a window into the homes of millions of
Americans every single night,'' said Bush. ``From the comfort of
our homes and the company of our families, your shows are going to
make us think and think hard about people who are hungry, homeless,
those without hope, and how we can help them.''
   ``These shows can be catalysts to greater community
involvement,'' he said, adding, ``I hope that every TV set in
America is tuned in to your shows those first three weeks in
December.''
   Asked afterwards if they agreed that violence and drugs were
``fading'' from the television screen, actress Joan Van Ark said
the industry is toning things down.
   Van Ark, who plays Valenne Ewing on ``Knots Landing,'' a spinoff
from Dallas, said, ``They have definitely cut back on J.R.'s trip
to the bar cart.''
   And now, whenver an actor gets into a car, ``the seat belts go
on instantly,'' she added.
   It is important to deliver such messages ``gently,'' she said,
and not to ``suddenly pull the plug on violence.''

   A judge granted doctors permission to give
blood transfusions to a premature baby Wednesday over the
objections of the infant's parents, who oppose the procedure
because of their religious beliefs.
   However, Superior Court Judge Paul A. Lowengrub said doctors at
Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden may only give a
transfusion in the event of a medical emergency.
   And a court-appointed medical guardian will make the decision to
give the infant blood if alternative treatments are exhausted,
Lowengrub said.
   The infant has not yet needed a transfusion, but hospital
officials sought the order as a precaution after learning of the
parents' objections to the procedure.
   The infant, weighing nearly five pounds, was delivered six weeks
prematurely by Caesarean section Sunday. The baby was pale and was
kept on a ventilator for the first 48 hours, according to court
documents.
   Neonatal specialists at the hospital said the infant could be at
risk because of low blood pressure and a low hemoglobin rate. The
hospital even reduced blood sampling to conserve the infant's blood
supply, according to Dr. Margaret Fernandes, chief of the
neonatology unit.
   Lowengrub first signed a temporary order Tuesday allowing
doctors to perform blood transfusions if necessary. After a hearing
Wednesday, the judge extended his order for the duration of the
infant's hospitalization.
   The parents of the baby boy, identified in court documents only
as ``Baby Caban,'' had objected to the procedure, saying it was
against their beliefs as Jehovah's Witnesses to allow the
transfusion of blood or blood products into their bodies.
   Followers of the faith believe transfusions go against the
teachings of the Bible, citing a passage of Leviticus that reads:
``Whatsoever man ... eats any manner of blood, I will cut him off
from among his people.''
   ``What they want to do is follow their religious tenets,'' said
Carl A. Price, the parents' attorney, who would not identify the
Willingboro couple. ``They want to be able to make the decision
about any medical treatment that they would receive and their child
would receive.''
   Lowengrub, however, rejected their arguments.
   ``Parents may choose to become martyrs themselves, but they
cannot make martyrs of their children,'' the judge said. ``The
right to belief is absolute, but the exercise of that belief is
not.''
   Under Lowengrub's order, the couple will make all other medical
decisions for their child.
   Michael Brennan, the hospital's attorney, said the hospital has
sought similar orders at least twice, but has never had to give
transfusions to patients who objected.
   He said the infant's condition has improved and he may not need
a transfusion.

<TEXT>
   Ralph P. Davidson announced Wednesday he will
resign as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts when his contract expires in February 1991 because of
differences with the center's board of trustees.
   Davidson, a former Time Inc. executive, took command of the
national arts center less than two years ago. He is reported to
have drawn complaints from the Kennedy Center board of trustees for
being a poor manager and the focus of personality clashes.
   The 45-member board accepted Davidson's advance notice of his
departure with praise for his ``dedication to the center and his
many management and programming initiatives.'' The board refused
any further comment beyond its five-paragraph statement.
   ``I arrived at my decision after several discussions with the
board and the realization that we had different priorities and
different expectations of each other,'' Davidson said in a separate
statement.
   ``These differences happen in institutions of all kinds and, as
regrettable as they may be, I fully understand the need for a
change for the sake of the institution,'' he said. Davidson did not
explain what those differences were.
   Davidson, 62, was hired in February 1988 to succeed Broadway
producer Roger L. Stevens, the founding chairman who officially
retired last August after a lengthy transition period.
   A search committee led by trustee James Evans was appointed to
find a successor to Davidson, who said he hoped a candidate could
be named by mid-1990.
   Reports of Davidson's disagreements with the trustees surfaced
after the board's last meeting three months ago.
   The trustees were said to have become increasingly upset by
Davidson's aloof management style, his arbitrary treatment of the
Kennedy Center staff and his failure to attend important social
functions.
   The Washington Post reported earlier Wednesday that a recent
internal poll disclosed that a clear majority of 28 trustees did
not want Davidson to remain.
   Davidson receives $125,000 annually as chairman and chief
executive officer of the Kennedy Center, the white marble cultural
center on the Potomac River which opened in September 1971 as the
only official memorial to President John F. Kennedy.
   Davidson was reported to have received a $4 million ``golden
parachute'' when he agreed to take early retirement in 1988 as
chairman of the executive committee of the Time Inc. board of
directors. Stevens, his predecessor at the Kennedy Center, served
as chairman without salary.

   Jim Bakker, banished to prison for
fleecing his PTL followers out of millions of dollars, was ``in
good spirits'' Wednesday as he got adjusted to life behind bars, a
prison spokesman said.
   ``He's settling in,'' said Brian Ross, a spokesman at the
Talladega Federal Correctional Institution. ``He's doing fine.''
   Two former Bakker aides known for their fashionable suits and
baby crocodile shoes reported to another Alabama federal prison to
begin serving more than 17 years for tax evasion.
   Bakker, head bowed and bound hand and foot, arrived at the
Talladega prison in eastern Alabama late Tuesday under the glare of
television lights after a six-hour drive from Charlotte, N.C.,
where he was sentenced.
   The founder of PTL had no comment for reporters as guards
hustled him from a brown sedan to the entrance of the rural,
medium-security lockup. Two 15-foot fences topped with razor wire
surround the facility.
   Earlier Tuesday in Charlotte, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter
sentenced Bakker to 45 years in prison and fined him $500,000 for
defrauding thousands of followers of his television ministry. He
was ordered to begin serving the long sentence immediately.
   Bakker was issued an orange jumpsuit and assigned to a two-man
cell with bunk beds, a desk, lavoratory and toilet. Prison
officials would not reveal his cellmate's identity, other than to
say he was ``another lightweight security inmate.''
   Bakker made some telephone calls Wednesday morning and exercised
in an outside yard, Ross said. He would not disclose if Bakker had
spoken with his wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, or other family members.
   ``Basically, he's familiarizing himself with unit operations and
the institution's rules and regulations,'' Ross said in a telephone
interview. ``He's being supervised in an open-type setting.''
   Mrs. Bakker and her 13-year-old son did not travel to Charlotte
for Bakker's sentencing Tuesday. They were staying with friends in
the Orlando area and she did not make herself available to
reporters.
   The Bakker's new television ministry in Orlando has been
suspended, but the storefront church they have been running in an
Orlando shopping mall remains open and is expected to hold Sunday
services with Mrs. Bakker and guest ministers.
   Ross said he met with Bakker Wednesday morning to relay numerous
media requests for interviews, which Bakker referred to his
attorney in North Carolina.
   The spokesman said no additional security measures were planned
during Bakker's stay at the prison, which often is a first stop for
federal prisoners in the Southeast. He is expected to be at the
facility for no more than two weeks before he is transferred to
another federal prison, which officials would not identify.
   Bakker, who was placed in a unit with about 375 other prisoners
awaiting assignment, would have to serve at least 10 years in
prison before he is eligible for parole unless a planned appeal is
successful.
   Ross said Bakker's family and attorneys can visit the defrocked
TV evangelist on three evenings during the week and all day on
weekends. Bakker also will be able to attend religious services on
Sundays.
   In Montgomery, David Taggart and his brother, James, arrived by
cab at the minimum-security prison at Maxwell Air Force Base about
10:39 a.m. Wednesday, Warden Wayne Seifert said.
   David Taggart was Bakker's personal assistant at PTL, handling
his travel arrangements and schedules and serving as the bank for
the PTL entourage whenever Bakker traveled. James Taggart was PTL's
interior designer.
   The Detroit natives, who started as piano players with the
ministry, were convicted of evading more than $500,000 in income
taxes. Prosecutors said they diverted more than $1 million in
ministry funds for personal uses, including expensive wardrobes,
jewelry and a Manhattan apartment.
   David Taggart was sentenced to 18 years, five months in prison
and his brother received 17 years, nine months.
   Seifert said they were assigned to a dormitory in which 40
inmates sleep on bunk beds in an open room.
   Dismissing descriptions of the minimum-security prison as a
country club, Seifert said, ``We have two 18-hole golf courses on
either side, though the only access our inmates have to the golf
courses is to cut the grass.''

<HEAD>Officials Stunned by Cocaine Charges Against Police Chief</HEAD>

   Charges that the police chief stole
cocaine stunned city officials, who described him as a warrior
against drugs, but a prosecutor told the court the chief admitted
using cocaine for five years.
   ``My first reaction is absolute shock,'' said City Councilor
Gregory Buckley. ``He has done a terrific job working on the crime
and drug problems in my section of the city.''
   Chief Richard Sproules, a 25-year department veteran and a
former narcotics officer, pleaded innocent Tuesday in Brockton
District Court and was released on his own recognizance. He was
suspended from the department with pay until the case is resolved.
   Sproules, 45, was arrested after a lengthy state police probe
linked him to the disappearance of cocaine from the police
station's evidence room, said Lt. Paul Studenski.
   In Tuesday's court hearing, special prosecutor John Kivlan said
Sproules ``admitted to investigators, in substance, that over a
five-year period, he has been using cocaine on a daily basis.''
   Bruce Edmands, an attorney for Sproules, said his client would
not comment on the case. He said the statements attributed to the
police chief about drug use were taken out of context, and he
called the case ``weak, tenuous at best.''
   ``It's a tough time for the family and we're trying to deal with
it here,'' he said.
   Sproules also worked as a soccer coach at Bridgewater-Raynham
High School.
   ``The kids liked him,'' school Superintendent Edward O'Donoghue
said. ``He carried out his responsibilities in an exemplary way.''
   Sproules has been removed from his coaching duties pending the
outcome of the case, O'Donoghue said Wednesday.
   Brockton is a city of 95,000 people 23 miles south of Boston.

<HEAD>Students Say Stereotypes Often Begin At Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Suburban students see Detroit as a city of
rat-infested, rundown buildings where murder and drug-dealing are
rampant. City students see the suburbs as havens of expensive cars,
plush homes and spoiled brats.
   Some of them traded places Wednesday after swapping stories the
day before, and both found out how wrong they were.
   ``They think we all have perfect lives,'' said Shannon Doak, a
17-year-old senior at Dearborn's Edsel Ford High School. ``There
are drugs in the suburbs, too. You just don't hear about it.''
   Hearing about the differences and learning to recognize and
respect them are the aims of the exchange arranged by New Detroit
Inc., an urban coalition founded in 1967 after race riots
devastated much of the city.
   ``The teachers see that the students have a different attitude,
just with the one day they spend in another school,'' Vivian
Buffington, a race relations consultant who organized the program,
said Wednesday.
   The New Detroit exchange program was started four years ago to
promote intercultural harmony and slow racial prejudice among
teen-agers.
   Students, chosen to participate through a variety of methods,
say some of their biggest misconceptions come from home.
   ``My parents don't know both sides, and I think I can help them
see that Detroit isn't what they think it is,'' Aliza Pearlberg, a
17-year-old senior at Southfield-Lathrup High School, said after
Tuesday's session at Mercy College in Detroit.
   Curtis Davenport, from the Interfaith Center for Racial Justice
in Mount Clemens, said students find a conflict between what they
learn at sessions like Tuesday's and what they hear at home.
   ``It's tough for them because a lot of their parents are trying
to socialize them in different beliefs,'' Davenport said.
   In Tuesday's sessions, students from the city and outlying
suburbs formed groups of 30 and played games designed to raise
consciousness to racial equality.
   One game required students from suburbs to draw their
impressions of the city while students from Detroit drew their
concepts of the suburbs.
   ``I get upset that people think you're a charity case if you
come from Detroit,'' said Wade Brown, a 17-year-old Detroit
resident and senior at University Liggett School in fashionable
Grosse Pointe Woods. ``They think that you have only one parent and
live in a slum.''
   Participants in this week's program, one of two held each school
year, were 354 students and 48 teachers.

<TEXT>
   Residents of a southern Chile community
on Wednesday mourned the death of a baby whale that it adopted
three months ago after the creature took refuge in a local cove
with its mother.
   But fishermen in the village of Punta Lavapie reacted
differently _ they butchered the 26-foot-long right whale
``Tomito,'' or Tommy, for food after it died Monday in Arauco Gulf.
   ``All Arauco is hurting,'' the local governor, Eugenia Cofre,
was quoted as saying Wednesday in the Santiago daily La Segunda.
   The whale and its mother arrived in July at the cove near Punta
Lavapie, 360 miles south of Santiago, residents said. Punta
Lavapie, a village of about 200 families, adopted the whales, which
are large-headed with wrinkles on the throat and chest, and
nicknamed them ``Tomito'' and ``Ema.''
   Thousands of tourists visited the warm-water cove along with
marine biologists. The scientists said the newborn whale was being
nurtured until it was big enough to endure the rigors of a
migratory trip to Antartica for feeding.
   But the whale was found dead on a rocky beach Monday, according
to Santiago newspapers. The cause of death was unclear, but some
newspapers said it may have been slashed by a fishing boat's
propeller.
   The newspapers carried photographs Wednesday of fishermen
carving up the whale with long kitchen knives.
   The mother remained offshore, frantically diving and surfacing,
the newspapers reported.
   Chilean naturalists said they planned to investigate the cause
of death. They said local authorities should have provided more
protection for the whales.

<HEAD>Two Members Of Congress Plan Lebanon Trip Despite Security Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of Congress plan a trip to Lebanon
to urge Christian leader Michel Aoun to accept a proposed peace
plan, despite warnings from the State Department that their
security cannot be guaranteed, sources said Wednesday.
   Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, and Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., both of
Lebanese-American descent, are seeking a meeting with Gen. Aoun,
the leader of Lebanon's predominantly Christian army who has
withheld his acceptance of the proposal to end the country's
14-year civil war, the sources said. They spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
   Rahall's office declined to discuss his trip, saying ``we can
neither confirm nor deny it, for security reasons.'' A spokesman
for Ms. Oakar said he could not obtain information about her plans.
   The White House, meanwhile, rejected any U.S. attempt to
influence Aoun. ``That's ... an internal matter for Lebanon and the
various factions there to deal with,'' said presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   President Bush did discuss the prospects for peace in Lebanon in
telephone calls Monday and Tuesday with Pope John Paul II,
President Francois Mitterrand of France and King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia, Fitzwater said.
   Bush expressed hope the plan ``would be a step in the direction
of Lebanese reform,'' said Fitzwater.
   The plan, adopted by 63 Lebanese legislators after three weeks
of closed-door meetings in Saudi Arabia, would shift political
control from the Christian minority to the Moslem majority in an
attempt to end the country's 14-year civil war.
   Aoun, who declared a ``war of liberation'' in March to drive the
40,000 Syrian troops from the country, called on the Lebanese
lawmakers to reject the plan when it comes up for a vote next month
because it fails to set a deadline for a Syrian pullout.
   Oakar and Rahall are no strangers to the dangers of Lebanon. In
1982 they visited Beirut at the height of the Israeli invasion to
offer their support for the Lebanese people and condemn the
fighting.
   But State Department officials said the situation now is far
more dangerous because the U.S. Embassy has been evacuated and the
two lawmakers would be completely dependent for their security on
their Lebanese hosts.
   ``We don't oppose their talking to him (Aoun), but we can't
offer any support or help if they get in trouble,'' said one
official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   State Department guidelines prohibit travel by Americans to
Lebanon, in most cases. ``The situation in Lebanon is so dangerous
that no U.S. citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts,''
according to the guidelines.
   U.S. passports are invalid for travel to Lebanon unless special
permission is obtained. Violation of this ban can be punishable by
imprisonment or a fine, the guidelines say.
   There are eight Americans missing in Lebanon, all believed to
have been kidnapped in the past five years by pro-Iranian radicals.
   The embassy was evacuated last month after Aoun made veiled
threats to take American hostages in order to draw attention to his
fight for expulsion of the Syrians.

<HEAD>Britain Nearing Action on Vietnamese Boat People in Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hong Kong cannot accommodate much longer 43,000
Vietnamese boat people who mainly are economic refugees, Britich
Foreign Secretary John Major said Wednesday.
   ``It is soon going to be necessary to tackle the thorny problem
of involuntary repatriation,'' Major told the House of Commons in
response to a question about the refugees in the British colony.
``It is not reasonable to accept that they will have to stay in
Hong Kong forever and I cannot _ and will not _ accept that.''
   ``We are seeking to cajole and persuade the Vietnamese boat
people to return, but I now have to recognize that the problem in
Hong Kong is acute and getting worse and cannot be borne much
longer,'' Major said.
   Some legislators of the governing Conservative party and the
Labor opposition expressed concern over Major's comments.
   Gerald Kaufman, Labor's foreign affairs spokesman, said the
refugees left Vietnam because the country was poor and that they
had to be dealt with in a humanitarian way.
   ``I think if we are going to have a solution which is humane yet
effective ... economic aid to Vietnam on a substantial scale has
got to be part of the answer,'' he told Channel 4 News.
   James Lester, a Conservative, said the United Nations and the
European Economic Community should help improve life in Vietnam.
   ``Unless we can do that many of us will have grave concerns
about repatriation,'' he said.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said that the 13,000 Vietnamese who
arrived in Hong Kong before 1988 qualified for refugee status
because of religious or political persecution.
   However, the vast majority of the 43,000 Vietnamese who have
arrived since June 1988 are expected to be disqualified on grounds
they left their homeland only to seek a better living elsewhere,
the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Only 386 refugees have agreed to return home from Hong Kong
voluntarily since September 1988, he said.

<HEAD>College Presidents Agree To Increase Minority Teachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five college presidents signed an agreement
Wednesday to work together to increase the representation of
blacks, Hispanics and other minorities in the teaching profession.
   Under the agreement, the institutions will work with local high
schools with large minority student bodies to identify 550 students
in grades nine through 12 with potential to develop the
self-confidence and sense of achievement essential for good
teachers.
   A ``Memorandum of Understanding and Intent'' was signed by the
presidents of the City College of New York, Xavier University of
Louisiana, Fordham University, Hostos Community College of New
York, and two institutions of the Ana G. Mendez Educational
Foundation in Puerto Rico, Metropolitan University and the
University of Turabo.
   Officials said the high school students will move through a
rigorous four-year program of Saturday and summer courses,
including field trips and university visits. They will receive
guidance in choosing a college or university and help in seeking
financial backing through scholarships, loans and grants.
   The students' college programs will include special seminars and
workshops, student exchange programs, and hands-on teaching
experience. Students in two-year colleges will be urged to go on to
four-year institutions, and outstanding students will be encouraged
to enter masters or doctorate programs.
   ``We have selected a clear goal: to develop a major,
comprehensive and collaborative model program to increase the
number and enhance the preparation of minority elementary and
secondary school teachers,'' said the agreement. ``We propose to
accomplish this by pooling resources whenever appropriate and
necessary and carrying out joint programs that can serve as model
for institutions nationwide.''

   Here is a county-by-county summary of death, injury and damage
reports from the Oct. 17 earthquake as gathered from the California
Office of Emergency Services, other agencies and reporters:
   ALAMEDA COUNTY (Oakland and communities east of San Francisco
Bay) _ Mile-and-a-quarter-long section of upper deck of Interstate
880 in Oakland collapsed, with 39 bodies recovered from the
wreckage so far.
   The entire viaduct will be razed, even the part that did not
collapse, and rebuilt to standards designed to withstand
earthquakes, transportation officials say. I-880, built for $10.2
million in 1957, was the state's first elevated freeway.
   The County Office of Emergency Services said 2,550 people were
left homeless. The OES reported Oakland suffered 95 percent of the
county's 349 injuries and $1.5 billion-plus in damages. In all, the
office said 264 businesses, including nine residential hotels, and
1,517 homes were damaged and at least 11 buildings destroyed.
Damage to Oakland port facilities estimated $105 million.
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Twelve deaths including one in Bay Bridge
collapse, 300 injured and treated at hospitals, an undetermined
number who sustained less serious injuries. The OES said 1,100
people were homeless. Damages estimated at $2.5 billion, and Mayor
Art Angos says total could be more than $3 billion.
   Sixty residential buildings were destroyed in the Marina
district. In preliminary reports, 250 buildings in the city are
described as unsafe and up to 1,000 need extensive repairs. Damage
to public buildings is estimated at $388 million, and the total to
public property $512 million.
   The Bay Bridge, the main link between the city and Oakland, is
shut until at least Nov. 16 for repairs. The elevated Embarcadero
Freeway will be closed for about three months, officials said.
   SAN MATEO COUNTY (borders San Francisco to south) _ Two hundred
eighty-two injuries, damage estimated at $350 million, 600 homes
damaged, three businesses destroyed and 637 damaged.
   SANTA CRUZ COUNTY (south of San Mateo) _ Five deaths, four in
Santa Cruz, 730 injuries, 9,500 homeless. Damage estimated at more
than $1 billion. City officials of Watsonville say damage there
near $500 million, and damage to city of Santa Cruz estimated at
$160 million. Capitola, Scotts Valley and Boulder Creek also
hard-hit.
   The quake's 7.1 epicenter was located in a state park in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, triggering landslides and touching off fires.
In the county, at least 275 homes destroyed and 2,066 damaged.
Highway 17 in Scotts Valley, which was completely blocked by a
slide after the quake, now open for one lane of controlled traffic.
   SANTA CLARA COUNTY (city of San Jose and communities on
southeastern end of San Francisco Bay) _ Five deaths and 650
injuries, including 93 people admitted to hospitals. The OES said
70 people were homeless. Damage estimate $560 million. Sixty-five
homes and six businesses destroyed. Damage to 104,000 dwellings and
384 businesses, according to city reports to county OES. Thirty
buildings collapsed in Los Gatos, on fringe of Santa Cruz Mountains.
   SAN BENITO COUNTY (south and east of Santa Cruz) _ One hundred
ten injuries, 412 homeless. Damage estimate $100 million.
Twenty-three businesses, 68 homes and 104 mobile homes destroyed;
28 businesses, two public buildings and 400 homes damaged.
   MONTEREY COUNTY (south of Santa Cruz) _ Two deaths, 14 injuries,
260 homeless. One hundred eleven homes, 32 commercial buildings and
20 mobile homes damaged, seven homes destroyed. Damage estimate
$100 million. Moss Landing Marine Lab, a university research
facility, destroyed.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's veto of a bill to provide
abortion assistance to impoverished victims of rape and incest was
sustained in the House on Wednesday as a 231-191 vote to override
him fell 51 votes short of the necessary two-thirds margin.
   Though narrow in scope, the bill carried symbolic importance in
the widening political struggle over the abortion issue, and
proponents took their loss with a vow to keep the president's feet
to the fire. But Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., called it ``a decisive
victory for the pro-life movement.''
   ``The president won a legislative victory today with use of a
legislative minority,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore. ``He will put
his party at tremendous risk in the next election, and some of his
allies on the House floor will not be returned.''
   A Republican, Rep. Bill Green of New York, who supported the
bill, said ``President Bush may well have stumbled on the one issue
that could cost him re-election.''
   The vote, in which 42 Republicans joined 189 Democrats in the
unsuccessful bid to enact the bill over the president's veto, left
intact an 8-year-old ban of federal financing of abortions for poor
women, except when their lives are threatened.
   ``We're pleased,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
``It shows strong support for the president's position.''
   The disputed provision would have permitted Medicaid abortions
for women who are victims of rape or incest, and who ``reported
promptly'' to authorities. It was part of a spending bill that now
goes back to the House Appropriations Committee for revision.
   Smith and other abortion opponents said the vote demonstrated
they can overcome future efforts to weaken the prohibition on most
Medicaid abortions, adding that it shows the political ground has
not shifted in favor of abortion rights, as some political
strategists argue.
   ``They made the mistake of thinking this was a one-round
fight,'' said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn.
   ``Some members who were panicked by pro-abortion propaganda in
the last few weeks are going to be surprised, because the final
tale hasn't been told on how this issue is cutting more liberal language
had passed
the House, although it had easily cleared the Senate.
   Abortion-rights supporters picked up a net 15 votes on the
override vote. But some of those who switched positions said they
did so for other reasons, since the vote affected the entire $156.7
billion spending bill.
   Fifty-nine Democrats and 132 Republicans voted to sustain the
veto.
   Eleven members did not vote, including Rep. James Courter, a
Republican who running for governor of New Jersey and who has been
accused of waffling on the abortion issue. His opponent, Democratic
Rep. James Florio, voted to override and later said Courter ``chose
to say this was not an issue of enough importance to adjust his
schedule to be here.''
   Smith, the anti-abortion leader, attributed most of the switches
to other issues but said there were ``a few marginal members who
have capitulated.''
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., said Democrats had not decided
on their next move. House Democratic Whip Bill Gray, D-Pa., said he
did not think Democrats would attempt to add similar abortion
language again to the same appropriations bill.
   Leaders of the move to liberalize Medicaid abortions held out
that possibility, however, and said in any event they would raise
the issue repeatedly by attempting to add similar language to other
bills.
   ``We will keep coming back,'' said Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
   The vote followed an emotion-packed debate on the House floor.
   Abortion-rights forces condemned Bush's veto as an
unconscionable infringement on the rights of poor women and
children victimized by rape and incest _ and one that will bring
political damage to Republicans.
   Abortion foes cast the issue as a moral one that would invite
widespread federal financing of abortions.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., author of the current ban known as the
``Hyde amendment,'' pleaded, ``Don't force death upon an innocent
victim.''
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., raised the name of Willie Horton, the
man who Republicans and the Bush campaign cited last year as
evidence that Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis, the governor of
Massachusetts, was soft on crime. Horton had raped a Maryland woman
while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison.
   ``God was gracious and Willie Horton did not impregnate that
woman,'' Hoyer said. ``But if he had, ... which one of us would
have stood before her and said, `Carry Willie Horton's baby to
term.'''
   In an indication of how politically difficult the vote was
regarded, the House Republican leader, Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill.,
said he would vote with Bush while suggesting he could change
positions later.

<HEAD>Hope Dims of Finding Survivors Among 90 Missing in Slum Landslide</HEAD>

   Rescue workers Wednesday dug through
tons of dirt and debris from a landslide that buried a Sao Paulo
shantytown, killing at least three people, injuring dozens and
leaving at least 90 missing.
   However, officials said they had little hope of finding
survivors from Tuesday's accident, which occurred after a
100-foot-high hill of dirt from construction sites collapsed at the
Nova Republica slum.
   Fire Department Maj. Luiz Roberto Carchedi said shantytown
community leaders estimated more than 90 people were missing.
   ``But that does not mean they are all dead,'' Carchedi said,
``because we are sure that many of those unaccounted for are in
temporary shelters.''
   ``We may never know how many people were killed,'' he added.
   At least three people died and dozens of slum dwellers were
injured Tuesday evening in the landslide, fire officials said.
   ``We heard a loud roar and the ground shook and we ran for the
door,'' Maria dos Prazeres, a survivor, said in a televised
interview. ``We just had time to move before the walls came
crashing down on us.''
   A total of 56 wood and brick shacks were buried, Lt. Francisco
Tenorio de Albuquerque of the fire department said.
   ``The chances of finding anyone still alive beneath all this
rubble are extremely remote, but we will continue searching because
we can never give up hope,'' Carchedi said.
   Several of the shacks were buried underneath 45 feet of dirt,
Carchedi said.
   Firemen, policemen, civil defense workers and volunteers using
bulldozers, backhoes, shovels and in many cases their bare hands
worked nonstop Wednesday digging through mud in search of victims.
   Four specially trained police dogs scoured the area looking for
survivors.
   Carchedi, a rescue coordinator, said three bodies had been
pulled out and that about 20 people were treated for injuries at an
emergency treatment center set up near the slum.
   Survivors at the scene said about 400 people lived in 100 shacks
in the neighborhood.
   The landfill was made of dirt excavated from construction sites
around the city and illegally dumped next to the shantytown, said
Geraldo Jacob, an employee of the Public Works Department in Sao
Paulo.
   He said the earth was loose and slid away because of underground
streams that eroded its base.
   Fernando Luiz Prandini, a geologist of the Sao Paulo
University's Institute for Technological Research, surveyed the
area and estimated about 600,000 tons of earth collapsed.

   Defense efforts to move the trial of a police
officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black motorcylist
suffered a setback Wednesday when the judge cut off the hearing and
resumed screening jurors.
   Lawyers for Colombian-born Miami officer William Lozano contend
he cannot get a fair trial on two manslaughter charges in Miami
because jurors might fear that an innocent verdict would touch off
rioting.
   Lozano's shooting of Clement Lloyd, 23, who was being chased by
police, led to three days of racial violence in January. The
suspended officer is also charged in the death of Lloyd's
passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, killed in the subsequent crash.
   Lozano said Lloyd tried to run him over and he fired in
self-defense. Some witnesses disputed his account and called the
shooting unwarranted.
   The January riot was the fourth related to police slayings of
black men in Miami during the 1980s; two disturbances followed
acquittals of officers.
   Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina had sharply limited the
documents and witnesses defense attorney Roy Black could use to
request the change of venue, and on Wednesday, after they were
submitted, indicated he was in no hurry to rule on the issue.
   He cut off the defense presentation, and spent the rest of
Wednesday completing preliminary screening of a pool of more than
220 potential jurors.
   ``There very well may be post-trial difficulties,'' said Farina.
``But we don't need individuals testifying to that.''
   The case was recessed until Monday, when questioning of jurors
will continue. The questioning of jurors, with 15 minutes per side
for each potential juror, could take three weeks, attorneys said.
   Out-of-town depositions are being taken the rest of the week.
   ``Clearly we're disappointed,'' Black said outside the
courtroom. ``It's unfair to have a trial with jurors who are
concerned with something other than guilt or innocence.''
   Prosecutors has sought to quash Black's subpoenas, but did not
dispute the threat of violence in case of acquittal.
   ``There is a degree of probability that a riot will occur,''
said Roy Wood, an assistant Dade County attorney.
   Black had also fought for a change of venue in the case of
officer Luis Alvarez, who in 1984 was acquitted in the 1982 video
arcade shooting of Nevell Johnson. Both the slaying and the
innocent verdict led to disturbances.
   But the attorney said the situations are different.
   ``The atmosphere in this courthouse and the atmosphere in the
community are far worse this time,'' Black said.

   Raisa Gorbachev got a lesson in 19th
century Russian history Wednesday while her husband, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, discussed more current affairs with Finnish
leaders.
   Mrs. Gorbachev attracted a small crowd as she visited the
National Museum and an outdoor monument to composer Jean Sibelius,
who wrote the celebrated piece ``Finlandia.''
   She was almost invisible among bodyguards and umbrellas lifted
against the chilly drizzle.
   Mrs. Gorbachev was accompanied by Tellervo Koivisto, wife of
Finland's president; Soviet writer Vasily Bilov; and Valentina
Fedotova, editor of the magazine Soviet Woman.
   Dressed in a dark blue, pinstripe suit with a white blouse and
high-heel suede shoes, Mrs. Gorbachev stretched the museum visit to
almost an hour.
   She paused repeatedly to question her guide, C.J. Gardberg, head
of the Finnish Museum Authority.
   The tour included the throne Czar Alexander I used when opening
the first parliament in Finland after Russia seized it from Sweden
in the early 19th century.
   Finland was a Soviet Grand Duchy for over 100 years until the
1917 revolution.
   Mrs. Gorbachev arrived in Finland on Wednesday with her husband
on a three-day visit.

<HEAD>Baker Says More Sanctions Against South Africa Inappropriate Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Wednesday further sanctions against South Africa would be
inappropriate now because of steps the country's new government is
taking toward the black majority.
   Baker said he refused to ``choose sides'' in the Commonwealth
dispute in which British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused
to go along with a call by other Commonwealth leaders for further
sanctions.
   Instead, he reiterated that the United States is committed to
ending apartheid by assisting blacks in South Africa economically
and politically and would work through diplomcy to resolve
conflicts.
   ``We're going to continue to work with our allies to support
change in South Africa, and we're going to try and continue to work
with (the U.S.) Congress to develop a bipartisan approach,'' Baker
said.
   He said action taken by President F.W. de Klerk and his
government in recent weeks ``is clearly a step in the right
direction, and I think that that step argues for continued patience
with respect to the question of further sanctions.''
   ``I think it would be inappropriate now to move forward with
further sanctions in the light of the efforts of that new
government _ obvious efforts of that new government to move in the
right direction,'' Baker said.
   Baker didn't refer specifically to steps taken by the de Klerk
government such as freeing of imprisoned black leaders and
permitting anti-apartheid demonstrating.
   The United States has said since September that it doesn't think
sanctions should be increased now but that it might re-evaluate its
position if negotiations between the South African government and
blacks fail to achieve progress by next summer.

   The Bush administration will send a delegation
to a conference on global warming next month in the Netherlands,
but is not prepared to commit itself to action against the problem,
officials said Wednesday.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, who will head the
delegation, said the administration's policy on global warming has
yet to be worked out.
   Reilly said it is premature to call for a commitment to freeze
emissions by the year 2000 of the ``greenhouse'' gases. These are
gases whose accumulation in the atmosphere is, according to most
scientists, warming the globe.
   The Dutch government is expected to propose such a freeze of
carbon dioxide emissions at the 68-nation conference Nov. 6-7 near
The Hague. Carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels and
cutting down forests, is the principal warming gas.
   President Bush promised during his election campaign last year
to convene a similar international conference on global warming,
but nothing has been done. Reilly, in a meeting with reporters, did
not discuss the president's campaign promise.
   The administration reportedly has been divided on how aggressive
a role the United States should assume in confronting global
warming.
   According to administration sources, it was not clear until
earlier this week that Reilly actually would go to the conference
which will be attended by environmental ministers from the around
the world.
   Christopher Flavin, an expert on global warming issues for
Worldwatch Institute, an environmentally oriented research group,
said the flap over whether Reilly would attend the conference was
seen by many European officials as further indication that the
United States is not prepared to lead the effort to deal with
global warming.
   ``This is a major meeting ... It's been in the planning stage
for better part of a year. The United States just doesn't have its
act together,'' said Flavin.
   Flavin said that most European governments favor specific
commitments for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
   According to administration sources who have discussed the
question on condition they not be identified, Reilly has championed
a more aggressive response to the global warming concern and has
favored taking specific proposals to the meeting in the Netherlands.
   Others in the administration, including the president's science
adviser, D. Allan Bromley, have cautioned against moving too
quickly. They argue there has yet to emerge a clear scientific
consensus on the impact of the so-called greenhouse effect, nor
have the economic ramifications of a curb on the burning of fossil
fuels been made clear.
   Reilly refused to discuss the internal disagreements within the
administration.
   He told reporters that ``a whole range of questions'' remain
about global warming and how to respond. These questions should be
answered before the administration decides on specific commitments
for curbing greenhouse pollutants, he suggested.

the Colorado Rockies, where heavy snowfall was forecast.
   Advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted through
Thursday for the mountains and high valleys of Colorado. Up to 8
inches was forecast for the northern and central mountains.
   Clouds spread over much of the West on Wednesday afternoon with
scattered showers mainly over the Plateau region. A band of showers
and thunderstorms also extended along the east coast of Florida and
off the Carolina coast.
   A few showers were over south-central Texas and central Illinois.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the 6-hour period ending at 2 p.m.

   Sunny skies prevailed across much of the nation east of the
Rockies.
   A low pressure system in Nevada that was bringing showers to
parts of the West was also producing strong and gusty winds in
Arizona and all of the mountain areas and most of the desert areas
of Southern California.
   Temperatures warmed into the 70s across much of the nation east
of the Rockies, with 80s in southern Texas and southern Florida.
Readings were also in the 70s in southern Arizona and Southern
California.
   Record high temperatures for the date were set in Duluth, Minn.,
72; Madison, Wis., 75; Marquette, Mich., 73; and Minneapolis, 78.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 22 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.

   The secret police will disband undercover
units and turn off listening devices to try to win ``public
acceptance and prestige,'' and a place in Poland's reforms,
commanders said Wednesday.
   Freed from watching opposition activists _ many now hold posts
in the East bloc's first non-communist government _ security forces
can turn to fighting an alarming rise in property crimes spawned by
Poland's economic crisis, the officials said.
   ``The functionaries of the security service not only fully
accept these changes, but are aware that the changes are
irreversible,'' said Jerzy Karpacz, deputy chief of the secret
police.
   ``If any are found with a different view, they will have to
leave the force,'' he said.
   Karpacz was joined by the deputy commander of the police and the
spokesman for the Interior Ministry at a news conference that
opened the secret department to unusual scrutiny.
   ``It is obvious that the understanding, interpretation and
realization of the job of ... the Interior Ministry depends
directly on the broader social and political conditions of the
country,'' said spokesman Wojciech Garstka.
   ``That is why there will be changes _ perhaps the deepest in
postwar history _ in the way some responsibilities in the Interior
Ministry will be implemented,'' Garstka said.
   The despised secret police long symbolized communist control by
fear. They are remembered as executors of Stalinist purges,
clandestine monitors of the opposition and interrogators of
activists.
   Three rogue officers and their commander from the so-called
``Fourth Department,'' which spied on religious associations, were
convicted of the 1984 kidnapping and murder of the Rev. Jerzy
Popieluszko, a charismatic Solidarity priest whose bound body was
dumped in a river.
   The fourth department and five other units, including those
responsible for surveillance of citizens' loyalty and protection of
the agricultural, manufacturing and arms industries, have been
liquidated in the reform drive, Garstka said.
   Also dissolved are ``archaic'' units that inspected foreign mail
for secret messages and monitored foreign radio transmissions,
Garstka said, along with the political education unit.
   There will be ``much less frequent'' use of secret observation,
wiretapping and eavesdropping, and only with the permission of the
court or the prosecutor's office, he said.
   ``The most radical changes will be in the secret police. The
tasks of protecting internal security in the case of a
parliamentary democracy and political pluralism has to be
understood and executed in an essentially different manner from the
past,'' Garstka said.
   ``As long as any opposition was illegal, it was treated as a
threat. Since the considerable majority of the opposition ... has
become legal ... its representatives are in the parliament ... they
have ceased to be an object of interest to the secret police,'' he
said.
   Three new secret police units will be formed. One will protect
the constitutional order against political extremists and
terrorists who ``do not want to become legal'' under new freedoms,
another will safeguard the economy against espionage and disruption
and the third will analyze security information and work on crime
prevention, Garstka said.
   With Poland ``still the object of increased interest from
foreign intelligence services,'' counterintelligence efforts will
be strengthened, Garstka siad.
   Acknowledging an expansion of the secret police ranks over the
years, Garstka said the department will be limited to 7 percent of
the Interior Ministry, or about 7,500 posts.
   Greater importance will be put on public safety and protecting
property, Garstka said, and some secret police officers will be
transferred to help with a national alert issued to combat an
``alarming'' rise in thefts and burglaries.
   There are about 1,250 crimes per 100,000 people annually, which
Garstka said was relatively low by Western standards, but
increasing incidents of car break-ins and other crimes are being
reported as the economic situation worsens and the division between
the well-to-do and the impoverished widens.
   The 12,500-member paramilitary ZOMO riot police, disbanded in a
symbolic move Sept. 29, will be replaced by ``prevention squads''
of 5,177 officers in 22 of the 49 provinces. They will be
supplemented by 13,000 men serving in the police as an alternative
to mandatory military duty, Garstka said.
   Interior Ministry officials were questioned about confiscations
of once-banned underground publications, the privileges supposedly
provided to security forces and what would happen to the
information gathered through surveillance.
   They said material confiscated but not destroyed following court
procedures might be returned if proper application was made.
   As the secret police units were disbanded, ``all the resources
were listed and in cases in which analyses were not useful, they
were destroyed,'' Karpacz said.
   He denied that a special unit existed to monitor foreign
journalists but would not answer directly whether their offices and
homes were bugged.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, one of four remaining
communists in the 24-member Solidarity-led cabinet, has recommended
that the prime minister create an advisory committee representing
Poland's political forces ``to deepen society's control of the
Interior Ministry,'' Garstka said.
   Interior Ministry officers were brought together this month for
a two-day seminar during which Kiszczak gave a lecture on how they
should work ``in the new conditions,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Acting in a responsible and cautious way, according to law,
with professionalism, openly informing society about their actions
and problems, the Interior Ministry is going to strive for public
acceptance and prestige,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israel Protests Papal Call for Palestinian Homeland</HEAD>

   Israel on Wednesday protested a call by Pope
John Paul II for creation of a Palestinian homeland.
   ``We cannot but express the deep feeling of disappointment over
the statement made by the pope and our hope that the Catholic
Church and those leading it would finally conduct a soul-searching
regarding the political reality of these days,'' said Minister Ehud
Olmert, who is responsible for Arab affairs.
   He made his statement in Parliament on behalf of the Israeli
Cabinet.
   ``The pope spoke about the difficult conflict which is torturing
for all of us and mentioned `another people' in a style reminiscent
of past relations with the Church that we considered long gone,''
Olmert said.
   In a brief speech Sunday, John Paul expressed solidarity with
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, who have
been rebelling against Israeli rule the past 22 months.
   ``From the Holy Land come calls for help and solidarity from the
inhabitants of the West Bank and from Gaza,'' the pope said. ``They
are the cries of an entire people which today is particularly tired
and feels weaker after decades of conflict with another people
linked to the same land by their history and their faith.''
   He added: ``I would like to express to these people my most
profound solidarity, assuring them that the pope continues to make
his own their legitimate request to live in peace in a country of
their own, respecting the rights of every other people to enjoy the
necessary security and tranquility.''
   The statement did not specifically mention the Jewish people or
Israel, with which the Vatican has no diplomatic relations.
   Israel opposes formation of an independent Palestinian state,
fearing it would threaten Israel's security. Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's Likud bloc and other right-wing parties view the occupied
territories as an integral part of Israel.
   The PLO's parliament-in-exile from its headquarters in Tunisia
last year declared Palestine as an independent state without giving
specific boundaries. Israel refuses to speak to the PLO, which it
considers a terrorist group.
   
   Shamir's adviser Avi Pazner, reacting to the pope's statement,
was quoted Monday by the English-language Jerusalem Post as saying:
``The pope's concern for a homeland for the Palestinians is very
peculiar in light of the fact that despite the 40 years of Israel's
existence, the Vatican has yet to recognize or show the same
concern for the homeland of the Jewish people.''

   The Justice Department said Wednesday that a
court decision allowing former President Reagan's papers to be
subpoenaed for an Iran-Contra trial ``raised a serious question''
about the institution of the presidency.
   Comments by chief spokesman David Runkel appeared to signal that
top Justice Department officials were studying the possibility of
supporting Reagan in any challenge to subpoenas for notes and
diaries for use as evidence by former National Security Adviser
John M. Poindexter.
   Runkel emphasized that the department has not formulated a
position on Tuesday's ruling by the trial judge in Poindexter's
case and wouldn't do so without consulting with Reagan's private
attorney, Theodore B. Olson.
   But the spokesman said the ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold
Greene ``does raise a serious question about the institution of the
presidency.''
   ``The judge's decision would allow for the subpoenaing of
material from President Reagan that dealt with discussions he had
when he was president,'' Runkel said. ``We intend to take a look at
that.''
   Runkel refused to discuss in more specific detail the nature of
the Justice Department's reaction to Greene's ruling.
   Asked if the department was considering a claim the papers are
protected by executive privilege, Runkel said only: ``The
possibilities are wide, I expect.''
   Olson declined to comment about whether Reagan would resist
subpoenas.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing various congressional
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair. He contends that Reagan's
diaries and notes taken during their frequent meetings will show
that the former president authorized many of his actions in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Greene held that if such diaries and notes contain relevant
information, Poindexter is entitled to subpoena them for use as
evidence at the trial, set to begin Jan. 22.
   Among other things, Poindexter contends that he and Reagan
discussed a false chronology of the administration's arms sales to
Iran that is the subject of four of the charges against the former
national security adviser.
   In his request for documents, Poindexter cited notes taken by
the former president and others during his meetings with Reagan as
well as presidential diaries.
   Prosecutors for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh were
allowed to read and take notes from typewritten extracts of
Reagan's diaries that were prepared by the White House.
   The diaries remain in Reagan's custody and he claims they are
his personal property, according to filings in the case.
   Greene ruled that Poindexter's attorneys may issue subpoenas for
documents kept by Reagan or at the National Archives. The subpoenas
would be returnable by Nov. 23. The judge refused to authorize
Poindexter to subpoena similar records from then-Vice President
Bush.
   Under the Presidential Records and Materials and Preservation
Act, a former president may invoke executive privilege to prevent
the archives from releasing certain papers. The law, however, does
not extend this privilege to subpoenas for material needed as
evidence in a criminal trial.
   Moreover, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 1973 that
then-President Nixon could not invoke executive privilege to
withhold tape recordings of his Oval Office conversations for use
as evidence in the Watergate prosecutions.
   The high court ruled that although a president has an executive
privilege over his papers, it cannot be invoked to prevent use of
papers deemed relevant to a criminal trial.

   Investors on Wednesday snapped up the first of
what will be $30 billion in special government bonds sold to
finance the savings and loan bailout.
   Buyers bid an average yield of 8.15 percent on $4.52 billion in
30-year bonds issued by the Resolution Funding Corp., called
Refcorp.
   The premium over regular Treasury 30-year bonds, which yielded
7.88 percent on Wednesday, was 0.27 percentage points, about what
Treasury Department officials were expecting.
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York, said investors demand the premium
because the government guarantee of interest payments on the
Refcorp bonds is not as strong as the full faith and credit
guarantee given direct government borrowing.
   ``Considering all of that, I think it was really well bid for.
The bonds were really well received and came in at about the spread
expected,'' he said.
   In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the government borrowed $20
billion for S&amp;Ls directly. The complex funding compromise put
together by the administration and Congress calls for an additional
$30 billion in borrowing through Refcorp by Sept. 30, 1991. Regular
quarterly auctions are planned.
   The Refcorp bonds, which the Bush administration favored, have
the advantage of keeping $30 billion out of the federal budget
deficit. However, Jones said that if the interest rate difference
holds at 0.27 percentage points, taxpayers will wind up spending
$2.43 billion extra for that accounting maneuver.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering
delivered a $65 million check for America's U.N. dues Wednesday, a
day later than intended.
   The U.S. check was meant to be a birthday gift delivered Tuesday
on United Nations Day, commemorating 44 years since the U.N.
Charter came into force on Oct. 24, 1945.
   The State Department sent an envelope that was to have included
the check Tuesday to the U.S. Mission, but someone forgot to
include the check, an official said.
   Pickering instead had to wait another day for the $65 million
check, said the official, who was familiar with the mix-up and
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in
mid-October that the United Nations had only $68 million in its
General Fund, barely enough to meet expenses through the end of the
month.
   The United States is the U.N. member most in arrears. Before the
latest payment, America owed more than $495 million to the regular
budget and $200 million more for peacekeeping activities.
   The $65 million will be applied to the 1989 U.S. dues of $216
million. The U.N.'s annual budget is about $776 million.
   Beginning in 1985, the Reagan administration began withholding
some of its the U.S. dues to protest what it said was the
organization's anti-Western bias, inefficiency and budget overruns.
   But in September 1988, Reagan announced he was pleased with the
world body's progress toward budget reform, staff cutbacks and a
new spirit of consensus and cooperation.
   Reagan left the details of paying the arrears to President Bush.
   U.S. Congressional subcommittees have given preliminary approval
for payment of $205.5 million toward the full 1990 fiscal year
assessment of $216 million.
   However, they have rejected State Department requests for $46
million more to pay some of the arrears, citing financial
constraints imposed by the U.S. federal budget deficit.

   Residents and merchants are still
rebuilding their lives and businesses two years after the Whittier
Narrows earthquake, painting a sobering forecast for cities heavily
damaged in the San Francisco quake.
   Patience, care and drive are the virtues earthquake veterans
here recommend for the communities in the San Francisco Bay region
and south to Santa Cruz County that were jolted Oct. 17 by an
earthquake that registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   ``The recovery effort is a function of the spirit of the people
affected by the disaster,'' said Whittier City Manager Tom Mauk.
   Once the community comes out of shock, plans for rebuilding must
be made right away, he said.
   ``It takes a longer time than anybody thinks,'' Mauk said.
``There's a lot to do and the key is you've just got to run and
sprint through it.''
   Speed should be tempered by organization and care for those
going through the process of applying to government agencies for
loans and grants and looking for building contractors, said Bill
Lewis, manager of the building rehabilitation department and code
enforcement.
   ``You always have opportunists,'' Lewis said. ``Unfortunately
some of those opportunists are what they call contractors.''
   The 5.9-magnitude earthquake of Oct. 1, 1987, and a
5.3-magnitude aftershock three days later caused more than $350
million damage in greater Los Angeles, including more than $78
million damage to suburban Whittier.
   About 5,000 homes and businesses were damaged.
   Lewis said the city of Santa Cruz, which was badly damaged in
last week's quake, is ``looking at from two to four years before
everything is put back together.
   ``It's just a massive undertaking,'' he said.
   ``I'm still running very, very skinny,'' saidAnthony Gonzalez,
who operates a bicycle shop in Whittier that's located next door to
a two-story building laced with earthquake cracks and surrounded by
a chain-link fence.
   ``It's not a positive thing having that building next door,'' he
said.
   Most evidence of the quakes _ collapsed walls, shattered glass
and toppled chimneys _ has long since been cleared away, and the
town of 73,000 bustles with traffic and shoppers. But it is clear
that repairs and replacement of what was lost will go on for years.
   The battered Whittier Theater still slumps in the ruins of its
facade and a boarded-up supermarket waits behind a chain-link fence
for wreckers to finish what the earthquake began nearly 25 months
ago.
   A pancaked parking structure at the Whittier Quad shopping
center is gone, along with a multi-story department store that was
the centerpiece, but new stores have yet to take shape on the
freshly graded land.
   A dozen lots remain empty in the quaint Village business
district, some behind fences bearing optimistic slogans: ``Toward
the Future,'' ``Better than Ever'' and ``Developing With Beauty.''
   About 30,000 people visited assistance centers in Southern
California after the Whittier quake. More than 14,000 applicants
got grants for home repairs from the federal Emergency Management
Agency and the Small Business Administration approved 8,400 loan
applications totaling about $150 million.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet sailor rescued after drifting in the
Pacific Ocean for 67 days made an unsanctioned solo trip out of the
Soviet Union ``for the adventure of it,'' but he wants to return,
his rescuer said Wednesday.
   Konstantin Rybinster, 30, was brought to this U.S. territory
Wednesday by the container ship USS President Roosevelt.
   ``He wants to return to Russia,'' said Ren W. Vurpillat, captain
of the Roosevelt. ``He spoke to a representative of the State
Department who speaks Russian and he told him he wants to go back.''
   Rybinster, a professional seaman, initially had wanted to reach
San Francisco when he left the Soviet port of Vladivostock on June
2 in a 20-foot sailboat, according to Vurpillat and Charles Kirk,
acting U.S. officer in charge of immigration on Guam.
   Rybinster told authorities the mast on his sailboat broke Aug.
14. The vessel drifted until last Friday, when the Roosevelt
spotted Rybinster's boat near Wake Island, 1,300 miles northeast of
Guam.
   The sailor said he had packed enough food and water for 40 days
and survived on fish and rainwater for the remainder of his ordeal,
Kirk said.
   Rybinster declined to speak with reporters upon his arrival. He
was whisked away in a white van to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in Agana.
   Kirk said Rybinster does not want to defect and although his
trip was not authorized, ``he has no qualms about going home.''
   He said Rybinster probably would be returned to the Soviet Union
via Japan in the next few days.

<HEAD>Libyans Barred From Entering Italy for `Day of Mourning'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday blocked more than 800
Libyans who arrived by boat to mark a ``day of mourning'' declared
by Col. Moammar Gadhafi for Libyans deported during Italian
colonial rule.
   The Libyan cruise ship Garnata arrived in port but police barred
the passengers from disembarking because they lacked entrance
visas, Italian officials said.
   The Libyans held up huge photos of Gadhafi and signed a
statement addressed to the Italian government saying they had made
a ``voyage of peace'' to visit the graves of relatives.
   Authorities said 846 Libyan passengers were on board.
   Libyan representatives met with Italian Foreign Ministry
officials in an attempt to get the Libyans into Italy, but there
was no change in the situation by late Wednesday.
   Italian news agencies, quoting unidentified sources in the
premier's office, said the Libyans would not be allowed into the
country. There was no immediate official confirmation.
   Gadhafi, as in other years, set aside Thursday as a day of
mourning for Libyans deported to Italy during colonial rule from
1911 to the end of World War II. Libya says at least 4,000 Libyans
were deported and that Oct. 26 is the 78th anniversary of the first
deportations to remote Italian islands.
   The Libyans on board the cruise ship planned to visit the graves
of relatives and take part in demonstrations in Rome and other
cities on Thursday.
   ``If they don't get the permits to enter Italy, they will go
back to Libya,'' Libya's ambassador, Abdel Rahman Shalgam, told
reporters in Rome.
   In Rome, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said authorities had
agreed to allow about 200 Libyans to come by plane but were taken
by surprise when Gadhafi sent the ship to Naples with 800 people
aboard.
   ``When 800 people arrive at a single port without visas, even if
you wanted to allow them to enter it would take days,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity as is customary.
   About 170 Libyans with valid visas did arrive by plane and
traveled to the tiny Italian island of Ustica to visit a cemetery
where Libyan deportees were buried.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted one of the Libyan crew
members aboard the ship as saying, ``They are all without visas
because they didn't have time to apply for them. It usually takes a
month to get them from the Italian embassy, but the trip was
arranged only a week ago.''
   All flights and international telecommunications will be halted
in Libya for 12 hours Thursday in observance of the day of
mourning, the official Libyan news agency JANA announced earlier
this week.
   The day is part of Gadhafi's persistent demand that Italy pay
reparations for its colonial occupation.
   The Italian government, however, says Italy met its obligations
with payment of an idemnity of 1.5 million British pounds, at the
time worth $6.7 million, under a 1956 agreement with the then
Libyan monarchy.
   Gadhafi deposed the monarchy in a 1969 coup.

<HEAD>New Immigration Chief Opposes Big Ditch On Mexican Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service said Wednesday that he opposed digging a
4{-mile ditch in Southern California to discourage illegal border
crossings from Mexico.
   ``I don't think the ditch is a very good idea, but I think some
things have to be done along the Southern Border'' to stem illegal
crossings, Gene McNary told reporters.
   McNary, who was confirmed Tuesday by the Senate to be INS
commissioner, said one of his top priorities it ``to get control of
the budget, personnel and procurement'' in an agency that was
described by a departing official as ``totally disorganized.''
   McNary said he wanted to secure the border ``in a humane way,''
adding that repairing fences might be an alternative.
   McNary said he accepted as valid some of the criticisms leveled
at the agency by Raymond M. Momboisse, the agency's former general
counsel who said ``incompetency at all levels of command render
many key officials liable to disciplinary charges.''
   But McNary refused to say which of the many criticisms of INS
operation in Momboisse's 22-page memo he considered to be valid.
   ``I appreciate the memo,'' McNary said. ``He was in a key
position, so his ideas, even though they might be biased, are ideas
from an insider. I have read the memo and probaby will read it
again.''
   The new commissioner, who has not been formally sworn into
office, said he wanted to centralize the operations of INS, which
was criticized earlier this year in a Justice Department audit that
found mismanagement and waste.
   INS ended the last fiscal year with an estimated $30 million
deficit, which one source said resulted from the decentralization
of agency operations under McNary's predecessor, Alan Nelson.
   McNary's comments about the drainage ditch, which has drawn
opposition from Hispanic organizations and the Mexican government,
indicated the government may scrap plans to build it.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has yet to approve construction
of the project, which the Border Patrol said would make it harder
drivers to smuggle drugs and illegal aliens across the desert near
San Diego.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said he was unaware
of any decision on the issue by the attorney general.

<HEAD>Agency to Hand Out Up to $300 Million In Hurricane Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Small Business Administration
said Wednesday it expects to authorize up to $300 million in loans
for Puerto Rican businesses damaged by Hurricane Hugo.
   Agency administrator Susan S. Engeleiter on Wednesday visited
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon to brief him on progress made in
hurricane aid requests.
   She said she had also come to ``ensure him that the earthquake
in California will not affect the aid to be received by Puerto
Rico.''
   Hurricane Hugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina
last month. The storm killed 33 people in the Caribbean and 29 on
the mainland United States, coming ashore at Charleston, S.C., on
Sept. 21.
   More than 60 people were killed in the Oct. 17 quake in northern
California, according to the official toll.
   Ms. Engeleiter said that so far, her agency had received 1,567
requests for emergency loans from storm-stricken business owners in
Puerto Rico and 1,690 in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   She said the agency expected to hand out $250 million to $300
million in hurricane loans to small businesses on Puerto Rico.
   The administrator said the agency expects to provide a total of
about $700 million in loans for hurricane-stricken businesses in
the Caribbean and U.S. East Coast.
   She said her agency in an average year distributes only about
$250 million in loans to small businesses throughout the United
States.

   A magistrates court Wednesday charged two
Arabs in the deadly attack on a Greek cruise ship in July 1988, a
court spokesman said.
   The court charged Adnan Zosad and Hajak Jaballah with
premeditated murder, causing premeditated explosions, premeditated
arson and the illegal possession and use of weapons.
   Nine people died when the attackers opened fire on tourists and
set off explosives on the City of Poros cruise ship as it
approached Trocadero harbor near Athens.
   A district attorney in this city near Athens issued arrest
warrants for Zosad and Jaballah in January.
   However, investigators have not been able to determine whether
the two escaped from the ship, or were killed or injured in the
explosions.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call For Counsumer Boycott of Drift Net Caught Tuna</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lede to CORRECT day to Wednesday.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two lawmakers called Wednesday for a
nationwide consumer boycott of canned tuna imported from countries
whose fishing fleets use drift nets.
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, American
Samoa's non-voting delegate to Congress, also urged consumers not
to purchase tuna from nations whose canneries process fish supplied
by the drift-net fleets.
   DeFazio said it was his understanding that virtually all of the
canned tuna imported from Southeast Asia contained fish caught by
the drift-net fleets of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and that
Thailand was the ``principal processor'' of such fish.
   All imported tuna is required to bear the country of origin on
its label, although DeFazio said such labeling was often in fine
print.
   ``The United States is the only major market for canned tuna,
importing almost $250 million of drift-net-caught tuna just last
year,'' DeFazio said. ``I think American consumers would be willing
to pay a few cents more for a can of tuna in order to force these
nations to stop using drift nets.
   ``I have yet to meet an American family that thinks it is a good
idea to strangle dolphins and other animals in drift nets.''
   DeFazio said about 30 percent of the canned tuna sold in the
United States is imported.
   ``The American market has enormous economic clout and can force
a change in these fishing technologies,'' said Gerry Leape,
Greenpeace's legislative director for ocean ecology issues.
   A Greenpeace spokeswoman, however, said later in the day the
environmental group was not actually calling for a boycott.
   ``We are not opposed to a boycott, but would prefer that things
be done legislatively,'' said Blair Palese. ``Boycotts are not the
answer, there are better ways to do things. We tell people if they
want to avoid buying tuna, that's fine. But it is hard for
consumers to understand what tuna to buy or not to buy.''
   Last week, DeFazio introduced legislation that could lead to a
U.S. ban on fish imports from nations known to use drift nets or to
process drift-net catches.
   ``We need to hit them in their pocketbooks,'' DeFazio told a
news conference, adding that drift-net fleets were ``effectively
strip-mining'' the Pacific Ocean of both tuna and salmon.
   DeFazio said the small-mesh, monofilament nets also kill
thousands of marine mammals, sea birds and other marine animals
annually.
   ``Every night these nations drop 30,000 miles of net _ a virtual
wall of death that could encircle the entire globe,'' DeFazio said.
``If this continues for a few more years, we will have a beautiful,
shimmering biological desert off the West Coast.''
   The Bush administration has agreed to support a temporary
moratorium on drift-net fishing on the South Pacific, but has been
reluctant to seek a similar ban in either the North Pacific or
internationally.
   The administration earlier this summer reached separate
enforcement and monitoring agreements with Taiwan, Korea and Japan
that State Department officials hope will supply adequate
scientific data for the administration to decide whether to seek an
international ban.
   DeFazio said further studies were not needed and ``we do not
have time for lengthy negotiations.''

<HEAD>Iran, Saudi Arabia Lash Out at Critics of Their Death Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on
Wednesday lashed out at Amnesty International for complaining of
human rights abuses in Iran, calling the group a Western ``tool.''
   In Riyadh, Saudi officials were quoted as saying criticism of
the kingdom's use of the death penalty is anti-Islamic.
London-based Amnesty has taken Saudi officials to task over the
issue.
   In its annual global survey of human rights released Wednesday,
Amnesty said 142 executions had been announced by Iran last year.
However, it said it had learned of at least 1,700 secret executions.
   The rights group, which opposes capital punishment, issues
periodic lists of people executed or jailed for political reasons.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency of Iran, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as saying that Amnesty ``issues lists now
and then for fun, to impress other nations and discourage them from
sympathizing with the Islamic Republic.''
   ``In their propaganda, our enemies refer to drug traffickers as
political dissidents,'' Khamenei said at a gathering in Tehran.
   By its own figures, Iran has executed more than 1,000 purported
drug traffickers since December.
   Amnesty and some other independent rights groups believe many
political prisoners have been hanged as drug smugglers.
   ``All this propaganda is aimed at marring the image of the
Islamic Republic,'' the Iranian news agency quoted Khamenei as
saying.
   In an interview distributed by the official Saudi Press Agency,
Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz was quoted Wednesday
as stressing that Saudi Arabia is a theocratic state ruled by
Islamic law.
   ``These are laws from God inspired to His Prophet (Mohammed),''
he was quoted as saying.
   Under that law, Islamic courts may prescribe beheading by the
sword and crucifixion for those convicted of heresy or murder, the
chopping off of hands and feet for thieves, and stoning for
adulterers.
   In Saudi Arabia, convicted murderers are routinely beheaded in
public squares in front of mosques after Friday prayers.
   While the interview did not specifically mention Amnesty, Saudi
Arabia's beheading of 16 Moslem Shiites of Kuwaiti nationality last
month brought condemnation by Amnesty and other groups.
   The 16 were convicted by Islamic courts of planting bombs at the
height of the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca on July 10. One Pakistani
pilgrim was killed, and 16 other pilgrims were injured.

<HEAD>Government Agrees To Pay $170,000 To Settle Surveillance Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Wednesday it will
pay $170,000 to settle a lawsuit by a woman who claims her late
husband was illegally discredited by the FBI's Cointelpro domestic
surveillance program.
   The settlement ends a dispute over information the Justice
Department says would endanger national security if it were
publicly disclosed in the course of the litigation.
   The department invoked the state-secret privilege to protect the
information, but an appeals court ruled that the plaintiff could
proceed with the lawsuit notwithstanding government concerns about
national security.
   The Justice Department appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court
but as part of the settlement will withdraw its petition for
high-court review of the case.
   The Justice Department said it agreed to pay Lillie Albertson
$170,000 to settle her claim that the FBI forced her late husband's
expulsion from the Communist Party in 1964 by making it appear that
he was an FBI or police informant.
   Mrs. Albertson had claimed that FBI agents in New York planted a
fictious report in a car used by party members to make it appear
that her husband was an informant.
   As part of the settlement, Mrs. Albertson agreed to drop her
lawsuit along with a Freedom of Information Act claim for release
of government documents, the department said.
   Both sides stipulated that the settlement was not ``an admission
of liability or fault'' by the U.S. government or any employees,
the department said.
   Mrs. Albertson also agreed to join the Justice Department in
asking the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here to vacate last
April's opinions on the state-secret question. This would mean the
appellate court decision would not have any legal significance as a
precedent.
   In a split decision, a three-judge panel rejected the Justice
Department's request that it order dismissal of the lawsuit in the
ground that state secrets would be revealed.
   The court rejected the Justice Department's assertion that
``evidence of the government's activities of 20 to 30 years ago
will result in the disclosure of state secrets today.''
   In an unusual move, the court published a censored version of a
dissent by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. Twelve of the 18 pages of
Ginsburg's opinion were deleted because they contained classified
information.
   Ginsburg said the government had a ``legitimate and compelling
interest in preventing disclosure of exceedingly senstive national
security information.''
   He cited an affidavit by Assistant FBI Director James H. Geer,
head of the bureau's intelligence division, that disclosure of
evidence would ``pose a serious risk to the personal safety'' of
government informants and ``cause serious damage'' to national
security.
   Kate Martin, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union,
which represented Mrs. Albertson, called the settlement a victory
for her client.

   Fifteen House members _ including four
Republicans _ who had earlier opposed a measure to finance
abortions for poor women in the case of rape or incest sided
Wednesday with the pro-choice faction by voting to override
President Bush's veto.
   ``I've thought a lot about this,'' said Frank Pallone, D-N.J.,
saying he concluded it was a woman's decision whether to have an
abortion. ``I don't think I've been elected to come down here and
make those decisions for them.''
   But he was among the few who had a true change of heart on the
issue.
   Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., who led debate for the Democrats,
is chairman of the subcommittee that produced the massive spending
bill for labor, health and education programs, which contains the
expanded Medicaid coverage for abortions.
   Natcher voted to override Bush's veto but said he is not in
favor of abortion.
   ``I have never voted for an amendment or a bill that legalized
abortion,'' said Natcher, who voted `no' Oct. 11 when the House
took a pro-choice turn by approving 216-206 the amendment to
include rape and incest as reasons a woman could get Medicaid to
pay for her abortion.
   ``I like George Bush. He's wrong this time,'' he said before
voting to override.
   An aide to Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said her boss has always
been in favor of a woman's right to an abortion in the case of
rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.
   His problem with the amendment added Oct. 11 was with an
unrelated section relating to hypodermic needles for drug addicts.
   The needle language was modified by the time the bill got to the
president, so Gekas had no reason to want the bill vetoed, said his
press secretary, Joelle Ziemian.
   Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., voted to override the veto because he
supported the many programs, other than abortion, that would be
funded by the bill, said his spokesman.
   ``He did not see today's vote on a abortion, but for education
and (other) programs,'' said aide Jim Edwards.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., who also opposed the Oct. 11
language known as the Boxer amendment, issued a statement after his
vote Wednesday to override the president's veto, saying:
   ``I just don't believe that anyone who is a victim of rape or
incest should be denied this right. If it is legal for someone who
can afford it, how can we make it illegal for a victim of rape or
incest who is poor?''
   The other 10 members who opposed the Boxer amendment but voted
to override Bush's veto were Reps. James Clarke, D-N.C.; George
Darden, D-Ga.; Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.; Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.; Matthew
McHugh, D-N.Y.; Charles Pashayan, R-Calif.; Carl Perkins, D-Ky.;
Nick Rahall, D-W.Va.; Bruce Vento, D-Minn.; and Jamie Whitten,
D-Miss.
   Meanwhile, three House members who had supported the Boxer
amendment sided with Bush's veto.
   Both Reps. Helen Bentley, R-Md., and Porter Goss, R-Fla., said
they supported a woman's right to an abortion in the cases of rape,
incest or to save her life, but are opposed to using federal funds
for the procedure.
   They both said that the amendment proposed by Rep. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., that they favored was on preference, not funding,
and that their vote to sustain the Bush veto was consistent with
their opposition to the use of federal money for abortions.
   Rep. Alfred McCandless, R-Ala., said his vote to sustain Bush's
veto had nothing to do with abortion. He said he opposes the level
of funding for the three agencies in the appropriations package,
and that he still believes, as demonstrated by his vote Oct. 11 in
favor of the Boxer amendment, that a woman has a right to a
federally funded abortion in cases of rape, incest or to save her
life.

<HEAD>Israel Helps South Africa Build Missile, Network Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South African missile built with technology
provided by Israel made its first flight this summer from a South
African testing range, NBC News reported Wednesday.
   Citing unidentified intelligence sources and a CIA document, the
network said Jerusalem has been engaged in a partnership with
Pretoria to develop a nuclear missile capability for South Africa.
   NBC said Israel provides missile technology in return for a
continuous supply of enriched uranium for its own nuclear warheads,
and the use of a long-range test site.
   The network said the Overberg test range in South Africa and a
missile assembly building at the site were built for the use of
both countries, and that Israeli engineers have worked there for
several years.
   The CIA document said the first test resulting from the joint
project took place July 5 when a missile flew 900 miles southeast
from the test site to the Prince Edward Islands off South Africa,
NBC said.
   The document identified the South African state arms maker
Armscor as the builder of the missile, and said Israeli technology
was provided through Urdan Industries Ltd., based outside Tel Aviv,
NBC reported.
   The network said Israeli sources identified Gen. Chagay Regev, a
former senior aide to Israeli defense minister Yitzak Rabin, as
overseeing the project from Israel's embassy in Pretoria.
   NBC said that in response to its report, Rabin's office said it
would not comment on its missile program, and that South African
Foreign Minister Pik Botha also declined to comment.

   An Israel-backed militia expelled 28
Lebanese from Israel's security zone in southern Lebanon Wednesday
after three of their relatives defected from the militia to a rival
group, a spokesman said.
   The 28 family members, all from the Shiite Moslem village of
Ayta ech Chaab _ about a half-mile from the Israeli border _ were
ordered to leave the zone by the South Lebanon Army militia.
   Antoine Lahad, the ex-Lebanese army general who commands the
militia, issued the order after deciding the three militiamen, ages
18, 19, and 21, defected to the Shiite militia Amal, a spokesman at
Lahad's headquarters here said.
   The Syrian-backed Amal, which opposes Israeli control in
southern Lebanon, had claimed Monday it captured the three men
while they were supposedly hunting game.
   Lahad's militia is mainly made up of Christians, although it
includes some Shiites. It is a 2,500-man force that is trained,
equipped and paid by the Israeli military.
   Israel set up the security zone as a buffer to protect its
northern border when it pulled the bulk of its troops out of
southern Lebanon in 1985 after a three-year occupation.
   The zone is about 75 miles long and 2{ to 12 miles deep. It has
a population of about 200,000 Lebanese Christian, Druse and Moslems.

<HEAD>Partisan Clash In Senate Over Aid To Poland And Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican and Democratic senators clashed
Wednesday on the magnitude of aid to non-communist governments in
Poland and Hungary with Democrats accusing President Bush of
committing ``billions for war but only small change for peace.''
   Republicans counterattacked, charging Democrats with attempting
to solve Poland's serious economic problems with a flood of
taxpayers' money which they said would only serve to bail out
``failed socialist dinosaurs.''
   ``We have to be very careful and pragmatic about what we propose
to do,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``There
should not be a contest about how much money we can drag out of the
U.S. Treasury.''
   ``Some have complained that there are those in this body who are
doing this to embarrass the president of the United States; that is
simply wrong,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden, R-Del., who managed the
Democratic version of the bill on the Senate floor.
   ``What we are trying to do is to give shape to American
policy,'' Biden said. ``The only real issue is the level of
commitment.''
   Democrats said the Bush administration may lose a historic
opportunity to end the Cold War and encourage the spread of
democratic institutions and free enterprise throughout Eastern
Europe and ultimately in the Soviet Union itself.
   The debate comes after months of partisan squabbling about aid
levels for Eastern Europe which some say is on the verge of
peaceful change from communism to democracy.
   Under pressure to do more, Bush has little by little expanded
his aid proposal to its current level of $451 million over three
years.
   The House last week voted for an $840 million package of grants
and loans for the two countries. The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee had earlier urged adoption of a three-year $1.2 billion
aid plan.
   Senate Democrats now seek passage of a proposal sponsored by
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to authorize a total $989 million in
grants and loans over three years.
   The Simon bill includes $125 million in food aid, $200 million
in currency stabilization loans, $200 million in trade credit
insurance guarantees, $40 million in environmental aid, and $320
million for Poland and $80 million for Hungary to promote
development of private enterprise.
   Dole offered a substitute measure boosting the Bush proposal by
about $100 million to $585 million over the three-year period and
tying assistance to the development of a capitalist economy.
   Several Democrats used the debate to renew a drumbeat of
criticism against an administration they say is passively watching
from the sidelines as history takes a momentous turn.
   ``When asked for dramatic new steps, the administration takes a
wait and see attitude,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``When
asked for a solid commitment of aid, it instead offers a few words
of encouragement.
   ``Why is this administration so willing to commit billions for
war but only small change for peace?'' Leahy asked.

   Rep. Jack Brooks, the 66-year-old dean of the
Texas congressional delegation, is in intensive care at Bethesda
Naval Hospital suffering from an inflamation of the pancreas, a
colleague said Wednesday.
   Rep. J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle told fellow Democrats in the Texas
delegation that tests were continuing to determine the cause of the
inflammation.
   His office said later Brooks was suffering from ``acute
idiopathic pancreatitis,'' an inflammation of the pancreas of
unknown cause usually accompanied by severe pain.
   Brooks' condition was described by his office as serious but
stable. He was expected to remain in the intensive care unit at
Bethesda for several days, his office said.
   Brooks was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital on Sunday after
suffering abdominal pains during a flight from Texas to Washington.
   Pickle said Brooks was unable to have visitors.
   Brooks, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was first
elected to Congress in 1952. He took over the Judiciary Committee
in January, after serving as chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee since 1975.

Blast</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion ripped through an Amoco Production Co. gas
processing plant near Evanston, Wyo., Wednesday afternoon, killing
one man and injuring 11 people, company officials said.
   The force of the blast hurled several workers out of the
building and toppled a wall, according to Amoco spokesman Dick
Brewster.
   Another explosion Wednesday at a chemical and insulation plant
in New Haven, Conn., left one man seriously burned and sent plumes
of black smoke billowing over the city, authorities said.
   Five workers from the Wyoming plant were airlifted to Salt Lake
City hospitals following the 1 p.m. explosion. Four of them were
taken to the University of Utah's Intermountain Burn Center, where
they were in serious condition with burns and lacerations, hospital
officials said.
   The fifth man was taken to LDS Hospital with multiple fractures,
said hospital spokesman Tim Madden.
   Otho ``O.J.'' Reed of Evanston died at Evanston Regional
Hospital after attempts to revive him failed, according to hospital
spokeswoman Joan Rosenthal. Two workers were admitted to Evanston,
and four others were treated and released.
   The blast occurred as workers tried to install a gas compressor
unit in a compressor building of Amoco's Anschutz Ranch East gas
processing plant about 15 miles south of Evanston, Brewster said.
   Company officials were unsure what sparked the explosion, but it
appears it was caused by a gas leak.
   The fire in the building was brought under control by Amoco
crews before local firefighters arrived, Brewster said.
   The New Haven explosion and fire at the Acme Division of the
Allied Products Corp. was quickly put out with dry chemicals stored
inside the plant, said Fire Chief John Riordan. He said the cause
of the fire was under investigation.
   The injured man came running out of the plant with his pants
still on fire and yelling, ``Help me,'' said a co-worker, David
VanWinkle.
   The employee rolled on the grass in a desperate attempt to put
out the flames before VanWinkle, 29, was able to put out the fire
with an extinguisher he grabbed inside the building, he said.
   The victim was in critical condition at Yale-New Haven Hospital
with burns.
   VanWinkle said he and the victim were responsible for baking
silicon-treated fiberglass.

<TEXT>
   For the second time in five weeks, a sailor
stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Midway has been convicted
of espionage, the Navy said on Wednesday.
   Navy spokesman Lt. James Wood identified the second sailor, who
was sentenced to 10 years' confinement at hard labor, as electonics
warfare technician, Petty Officer Third Class Russell P. Brown, of
Norfolk, Neb.
   Brown, 21, was convicted ``for conspiring with Airman Recruit
James R. Wilmoth to commit espionage and for making false
statements'' to the Naval Investigative Service, Wood said.
   Wilmoth, 21, of Omaha, Neb., was sentenced last month to 35
years for trying to pass classified material to a Soviet agent.
   The sailors were arrested by NIS on July 25 in Yokosuka, Japan,
where the Midway is based.
   They were apprehended after an eight-month investigation, Wood
said.
   ``No other sailors have been implicated'' in the case, the
spokesman said.
   Besides his 10-year sentence, Brown received a dishonorable
discharge, reduction in rank from paygrade E-3 to E-1, and
forfeiture of all pay and allowances, Wood said.
   The Navy spokesman said a general court martial was convened and
charges against Brown referred to a trial by a military judge at
the order of the commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Vice Adm.
Henry H. Mauz Jr.
   The sailor's two-day trial began Oct. 18 in Yokosuka, Wood said.
   The spokesman said Brown pleaded not guilty and his case will be
reviewed by the fleet commander before he begins serving his
sentence.
   Wilmoth, who worked in food service aboard the aircraft carrier,
also was convicted of possession and distribution of hashish, Navy
spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said last month.
   Wood said Wilmoth did not have a security clearance, but that
Brown had one.
   The spokesman said he could not provide any details of the
classified information involved in the case.
   Asked about a report that Brown took classified documents from a
receptacle used to hold such documents slated for burning in the
electronics warfare center of the carrier, Wood said he could not
comment.
   ``That is part of the investigation that is still going on,''
Wood said.
   Wilmoth's court martial was in Yokosuka, as well, and he was
convicted on Sept. 24 on charges of attempted espionage, failure to
report a contact with a Soviet citizen, conspiracy to unlawfully
transfer classified material, and possession, use and distribution
of hashish.
   Wilmoth, who also received a dishonorable discharge, had been in
the Navy for 2 1@2 years and had served aboard the Midway since May
1988, Smith said.
   Brown had been in the Navy the same period of time as Wilmoth
and had been stationed aboard the aircraft carrier since May 1987,
Wood said.
   Wood said it has not yet been determined where the men will
serve out their sentences, but that it would be in the United
States.
   The spokesman said that Wilmoth had made a ``pre-trial
agreement'' with Navy officials and that ``a reduced sentence had
been discussed,'' but that he could not comment on a report that
the sailor's term was reduced to 15 years in exchange for
testifying against Brown at his court-martial.
   Brown's mother said Wednesday that her son and Wilmoth didn't
know each other before they enlisted in the Navy.
   Yvonne Brown of Norfolk, Neb., speaking through tears in a
telephone interview with The Omaha World-Herald, said she knows her
son is innocent.
   ``I know him. He would not do anything like that,'' Mrs. Brown
said.
   She said she and her husband, Tom D. Brown learned that their
son was in trouble when he called Saturday night. Brown told his
parents he wasn't guilty.
   ``He wouldn't lie. ... They didn't believe him,'' Mrs. Brown
said.

<TEXT>
   The defendant in the rape and murder of a
pregnant doctor angrily swore at a prosecutor and judge Wednesday
in a courtroom outburst that ended with the accused killer
handcuffed and taken away.
   ``I'm leaving, man! I'm leaving, (expletive)! You in trouble!''
Steven Smith screamed as prosecutor James Kindler cross-examined a
defense psychiatrist who testified the suspect was too deranged to
be prosecuted.
   Several jurors stared in surprise at Smith, who was standing at
the defense table. The defendant then said softly: ``There's
nothing I can do about it, man. I'm telling you straight out.''
   The turmoil was sparked when Kindler asked Dr. Daniel Schwartz
if Smith could be faking insanity to receive lenient treatment.
   State Supreme Court Justice James Leff then cleared the jury
from the room and instructed Smith he would tolerate no further
outbursts _ which prompted another explosion from the defendant.
   ``Well what the (expletive) is that, judge? ... You want me to
stop it? I can't control it! Listen to me, man, I'm not normal,
man, at all, at all,'' said Smith. ``That's what got me into
trouble here now. ... I'm here to get help, brother.''
   Smith was then handcuffed and led from the courtroom. Leff
brought the jury back, and cross-examination of Schwartz continued.
   Smith, 23, is on trial for the rape and murder of Dr. Kathryn
Hinnant, 33, originally of Lake City, S.C., in her fourth-floor
office at Bellevue Hospital on Jan. 9. She was five months pregnant.
   Schwartz, chief of forensic psychiatry at Brooklyn's Kings
County Hospital, said Smith, who has been in and out of mental
hospitals for the past decade, appears to have a psychosis related
to schizophrenia.
   Defense lawyer Marvyn Kornberg admitted in opening remarks that
Smith committed the crimes charged, but he argued that his client
is insane and therefore not responsible for his actions.

   A decision will be made later this year on
plans to move forward with a number of Star Wars experiments at
Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, the Army said on Wednesday.
   There are some 2,900 U.S. personnel at the Army's missile test
facility on the island.
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. Dick Bridges said the Army has concluded
an environmental impact statement on whether programs connected
with the Star Wars program _ formally known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative _ would have a significant environmental affect
on the atoll.
   The Army wants to provide ``test range facilities and support
services'' on the island, the Pentagon said in a statement.
   ``The proposed SDI tests at the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll
include the sensing and tracking of re-entry vehicles launched by
missiles from California and Hawaii,'' the statement said.
   Such a segment of the space-based anti-missile system envisions
rockets intercepting and destroying enemy missiles during the
middle and latter stages of their flight.
   In 1987, the Pentagon ordered an extensive environmental impact
statement, after a preliminary report found that the acceleration
of the Star Wars program would have no significant impact on any
U.S. facility, with the exception of Kwajalein.
   At that time, the Pentagon said, ``Potential impacts include the
possible degradation of water quality around the islands; the
possible degradation of the marine habitat ... and possible
socio-economic impacts as a result of population increases.''
   But after the latest study, Bridges said, the Army ``believes we
can minimize any adverse affects on the environment'' if it goes
through with its proposed actions on the atoll.
   The Army will not move forward with any action until a 30-day
period passes, during which opponents of the action may file
protests if they wish, Bridges said.

<HEAD>Fire Department Pleads With Tent City Residents to Move</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tent cities that spread out in parks
and vacant lots after the deadly Oct. 17 earthquake are unhealthy
and dangerous, firefighters and health officials said Wednesday.
   ``Our plan is not to physically move people but to convince them
that their options are better at other places,'' Fire Chief Gary
Smith said at a news conference Wednesday in Callaghan Park, where
about 160 people have set up camp.
   Some of those living in the tent cities were driven from their
homes because of damage. But fright has kept many others outside
even if inspectors have certified them sound.
   Still others refuse to move to Red Cross shelters because
they've gathered belongings into the tents _ things like sofas and
televisions _ that aren't allowed into the shelters.
   But Smith said there is concern that tent dwellers who are
cooking on charcoal braziers could be taking them in the tents,
creating fire and health hazards.
   Central Coast College student Enrique Alvarado, one of the tent
encampment's organizers, said he would try to persuade people to
move but would let them decide for themselves.
   Many of the people living in the tent cities refuse to enter any
building because they feel unsafe, said Patricia Mendez, a county
employee.
   About 1,200 Watsonville residents were displaced by the quake
and aftershocks. The quake killed dozens of people, injured
thousands and caused more than $7.1 billion damage throughout
Northern California. Watsonville, a poor agricultural community
just a few miles from the epicenter, was especially hard it.

   Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Samuel Pierce on Wednesday told Congress he would again ban
television cameras from his scheduled appearance before a House
subcommittee. His attorney hinted strongly that Pierce would again
refuse to testify.
   Pierce, who has been subpoenaed to appear on Friday, invoked his
right to ban television and radio coverage of the testimony during
a meeting between his attorneys and the subcommittee staff.
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Green denied a
request by the four major television networks for a permanent
injunction that would keep the clerk of the House from enforcing
the rule permitting a witness to ban broadcast coverage.
   The subcommittee on employment and housing of the Government
Operations Committee is investigating alleged fraud,
influence-peddling and mismanagement during Pierce's eight-year
tenure. Last month he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and refused to testify, contending the
subcommittee members had prejudged him.
   In an interview Wednesday night, Pierce's attorney, Paul L.
Perito, said a decision on whether Pierce would testify Friday
would not be made until Thursday morning. But he said he had seen
little evidence that the subcommittee's attitude toward the former
secretary had changed.
   ``I am still convinced that these people have prejudged my
client without merit and we have certainly not foreclosed a
continuation of the option we invoked at the previous hearing,''
Perito said.
   Stuart Weisberg, counsel for the subcommittee, declined comment
on the substance of the meeting except to confirm that Pierce's
attorneys had renewed their request that television and still
cameras and radio coverage be prohibited.
   ``It was a cordial and frank discussion,'' Weisberg said.
   Another congressional source, however, said that Pierce's
attorneys asked whether the subcommittee would require his presence
in the event he would again refuse to testify and were told that
subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., would insist that
Pierce personally appear.
   Another subcommittee member, however, said he thought it would
be a waste of time to hold a hearing if Pierce, the only scheduled
witness, was not going to testify. ``I'm not sure it's worth us
wasting our time to hear him tell us'' he won't testify, said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   ``I don't think Sam Pierce could tell us very much anyway.''
   Pierce appeared voluntarily before the panel in May and said he
took no direct role in decisions about what projects to finance,
asking only that projects supported by prominent Republicans
receive ``careful consideration.'' That appearance was covered live.
   Since then, however, a former Pierce deputy and documents
released by the agency have indicated that Pierce played a greater
role in some such decisions involving friends and political
associates.
   In addition to Pierce, three other former top HUD officials,
including two who served as his top aides, have refused to testify
on grounds that their testimony might tend to incriminate them.
   The judge dismissed the suit filed by Cable News Network Inc.,
Capital Cities-ABC Inc., CBS Inc., and National Broadcasting Co.
Inc.
   The networks, in alleging a violation of the First Amendment,
contended that the House may not arbitrarily delegate to a private
party the right to determine whether TV coverage of Pierce's
appearances will be allowed.
   Green ruled, however, that judicial review of the question is
barred by the Constitution. She said the House rule is within the
legitimate legislative sphere and is essential to legislating.
   The judge said the TV networks ``have chosen the wrong forum in
which to present their objection. Their recourse lies not with the
courts, but rather with the co-equal branch of government'' that
enacted the rule.

   The Senate approved legislation Wednesday
night boosting by $20 million the federal effort to lessen the
hazards posed by earthquakes and to reduce the losses they cause.
   The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., whose
own state lies across an earthquake fault, was adopted on voice
vote without debate. It now goes to the House.
   It increases the authorization for earthquake hazard programs
from the present $85 million to $105 million and expands the
mission of agencies responsible for increasing earthquake
preparedness.
   For example, the bill directs the preparation of model building
codes to make structures more resistant to quakes and expands
education and training programs.
   It also directs the U.S. Geological Survey to do further work on
the exact location of fault lines and to establish a center for the
international exchange of earthquake information.
   Of the additional $20 million authorization, $8 million would be
used for a study to determine why some buildings withstood last
week's earthquake in San Francisco while others did not. The
remaining $12 million would be used for earthquake preparedness.
   The actual $20 million is contained in the earthquake relief
provisions of the stopgap appropriations bill sent to President
Bush by the House earlier Wednesday. Under the rules of Congress,
every appropriation must be accompanied by an authorization bill
that sets a spending ceiling.

   Members of the Lac du Flambeau
Chippewa tribe Wednesday rejected a $35.6 million pact with the
state to curtail the Indians' off-reservation hunting and fishing.
   Outside the tribal hall, a crowd of people protesting the
agreement erupted in chants and screams of jubilation when told at
9:25 p.m. of the outcome: 439 votes against the plan and 366 for it.
   The pact, which many had expected to pass, would have paid the
tribe for not fishing for 10 years, then been renegotiated. Some
ceremonial fishing would still have been allowed.
   ``I feel great,'' said Scott Smith, a Lac du Flambeau member.
``They saved our rights.''
   Before the vote, about 30 to 40 opponents carried signs
criticizing the agreement as a ``sellout'' of the tribe's 19th
century treaty rights and some heckled tribal government officials
who walked by.
   The treaty rights, which courts have ruled allow Indians to
spearfish off their reservations, have caused controversy and
sparked some violence. Some sports fishermen are angered that the
Chippewa can fish with spears and out of season, which other
fishermen cannot do.
   ``Our ancestors thought enough to preserve our rights through
this treaty and our council is selling it,'' said Dorothy Thoms, a
tribal member who lives on the reservation in northwestern
Wisconsin.
   Tribal Chairman Mike Allen ordered the tribal center secured by
officers, saying the action was ``due to numerous threats to
disrupt the referendum election or take over the building.''
   Allen said he received a death threat after he left a meeting on
the reservation Tuesday night.
   ``They threatened me last night after the meeting and we've had
numerous threats and calls,'' Allen said. He said the death threat
was made in person, although he declined to identify the individual.
   About 10 officers from tribal police, the Great Lakes Indian
Fish and Wildlife Commission and Vilas County Sheriff's Department
patrolled near the center.
   Ms. Thoms said the protesters were prepared to go to jail if
tribal officials tried to quash their last-ditch efforts. ``I've
got my medicine and my toothbrush in my purse,'' she said.
   The state's six Chippewa bands retain spearfishing, hunting,
food gathering and timber cutting rights under court-affirmed 19th
century treaties that ceded northern Wisconsin to the federal
government.
   The Lac du Flambeau, with about 2,500 members, is traditionally
the most active of the state's Chippewa bands during the
spearfishing season.
   In recent years, opponents of the treaty rights have staged
large and sometimes violent protests at lakes where the Indians
have spearfished. Last spring nearly 200 protesters were arrested.
   The settlement with the Lac du Flambeau would have established a
$35.6 million trust fund from which individual tribal members would
have been paid. If it had been approved, it would have advanced to
the Wisconsin Legislature, where it faced opposition.
   Before the vote, Allen said the plan would advance no further if
it were defeated and the band is unlikely to continue negotiations
with the state.
   Opponents had thought there was little hope the agreement would
be voted down. They said a plan to give each tribal member $1,800
in the first year of the agreement would probably ensure its
passage.
   ``The Great Spirit won over tonight,'' said Thomas Maulson, an
organizer of the off-reservation spearfishing. ``The Lac du
Flambeau people came through.''

   A judge sent evangelist Jim Bakker
directly to jail to start a 45-year sentence for defrauding
followers of millions of dollars, saying people were ``sick of
being saps for money-grubbing preachers.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Tuesday also fined the
defrocked PTL founder $500,000, concluding that Bakker had
continued to milk the faithful even after his conviction for
overselling memberships in a Christian vacation retreat.
   The 49-year-old television evangelist left the courtroom in leg
irons and handcuffs on his way to federal prison in Alabama.
Depending on the outcome of an appeal, he will serve at least 10
years before being eligible for parole.

   John Poindexter's daily meetings with
President Reagan on Iran-Contra may entitle the former national
security adviser to subpoena some of the ex-president's notes and
diaries, a federal judge says.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene on Tuesday gave
Poindexter the go-ahead to seek ``relevant'' documents from Reagan.
He set Jan. 22 for Poindexter's trial on charges of conspiracy,
making false statements and obstructing Congress in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Greene said Poindexter will assert in his defense that his
activities were authorized by Reagan, contentions that suggest that
Reagan was far more deeply involved in details of the Iran-Contra
scandal than he has acknowledged. Greene rejected a request by
Poindexter for permission to subpoena notes of then-Vice President
Bush, saying Poindexter failed to show that Bush might have
authorized his activities.

   While applauding the Soviet admissions of past
mistakes, some Bush administration officials are concerned that the
Kremlin may be engaged in a sophisticated campaign to weaken U.S.
resolve on key foreign and defense policies.
   The administration's public response Tuesday to the speech by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was decidedly
favorable. In a speech Monday, Shevardnadze condemned the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and, in effect, said the United
States was correct in contending that a controversial radar station
in Siberia violated bilateral agreements.
   But one U.S. official, speaking anonymously, said Shevardnadze's
statements on Afghanistan may have been aimed at rallying U.S.
public opinion against continued U.S. military involvement in
Afghanistan.

   A century after the Vatican lost control of Rome,
politicians are accusing it of still trying to control the city's
politics.
   The charge stems from a speech by a top church administrator,
the papal vicar for Rome, suggesting that the city's voters choose
the Christian Democrats _ Italy's only church-linked party _ in
mayoral elections this weekend.
   The appeal by Cardinal Ugo Poletti has sparked a national outcry
about Roman Catholic Church involvement in Italian politics. ``We
seem to have returned to the Rome of the popes,'' commented Bettino
Craxi, leader of the Socialist party.

   After a week of closed-door bargaining with
the White House, Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd stepped before
television cameras to announce a compromise adding $1.1 billion to
President Bush's anti-drug program.
   His Republican counterpart, Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon,
quickly cautioned that they still needed to make sure Senate
leaders would accept the deal.
   ``I don't have to,'' the courteous, white-haired Byrd informed
Hatfield quietly _ but not so quietly that reporters couldn't hear.
``He kinda left it up to me.''
   A year after he relinquished his powerful post as Senate
Majority Leader, much of what happens in the Senate still is up to
the 71-year-old sixth term Democrat from West Virginia.
   _When Byrd believed lobbyists were getting out of hand, the
Senate approved his bill restricting their activities. It may well
be the only ethics legislation enacted this year.
   _When Bush proposed a drug initiative Byrd considered
inadequate, Byrd used his post as Senate Appropriations chairman to
force negotiations with the White House on expanding the program
and give Democrats a legislative success on a high-profile bill.
   _As the Senate's senior Democrat, he also claimed the title of
president pro tempore, third in line to the presidency. It's been
mostly a ceremonial post until now, but Byrd is overseeing a near
doubling of its budget for staff and other support and
strengthening his influence in the process.
   _He has been unabashedly funneling federal dollars into his
poverty-stricken home state. The 1990 military construction bill
orders the Pentagon to accelerate spending on West Virginia
projects to $49 million this year _ more than 10 times what the
Defense Department proposed.
   Until Byrd stepped down after six years as majority leader, the
Senate's top official had never before given up the job and
remained in Congress.
   Byrd's decision reflected in part a dissatisfaction with his
old-school, formal and sometimes quirky approach to the job.
Procedure often seemed more important than policy.
   In the wake of another presidential loss, the Democrats also
wanted someone who could better counter the White House on
television.
   There was much speculation that Byrd would simply take care of
home-state concerns and attend to his cherished study of Senate
history.
   But that is not his way.
   ``Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might,''
Byrd says, precisely quoting Ecclesiastes 9:10, the King James
Version. ``I have that sense of duty. I follow it meticulously.''
   ``I think he's been freed'' by giving up the role of party
leader, says Linda Peek, his former spokeswoman. ``Anybody who knew
him, knew that he wasn't going out to pasture,'' she said.
   Byrd was known for seemingly endless meetings as majority
leader, hoping to enlist as many Democrats as possible on any given
issue. He says he still tries to be fair, but, ``I don't have to
concern myself with developing a consensus.''
   Beyond his titles, Byrd's influence permeates the institution
he's called home since 1959.
   Many of the people he appointed when majority leader stayed
behind to oversee a broad swath of the machinery that operates the
Senate.
   In real estate alone, Byrd probably reigns over more of the
Senate wing of the Capitol than anyone else, with his two suites of
offices and support staff rooms. When Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, goes to work in the morning, it's in the Robert
C. Byrd Rooms.
   Both Byrd and Mitchell say there's no friction between them,
although others point to some instances.
   For example, on the Senate floor Mitchell looked up from some
work and asked Byrd if he needed a vote on one of his bills, a
motion the leader would make. Byrd politely told him he already did
it.
   Republicans note that Byrd's drug plan was developed almost
entirely within the appropriations committee, implying it was
foisted upon Mitchell. The two Democrats deny that too.
   Byrd brushes aside suggestions that personal clout is what gave
his drug plan priority over those of others who sought to take on
Bush on the politically popular topic. He just knows how to work
the system and line up support, he said.
   ``One could not be expected to walk into the Senate as a
freshman and do that kind of work,'' he said. ``There has to be
some knowledge of how this machine operates, and some experience in
dealing with other senators.
   ``And I've had ample experience,'' he says.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., says what Byrd has done so far is
``just the tip of the iceberg.''
   ``I think now he has the time and the position to focus his
attention on creating legislation,'' he said. Byrd is a powerful
presence for his party, Sasser said, who ``by force of personality
is very intimidating to members on the other side of the aisle.''
   Away from the spotlight, Byrd has been using his position as
appropriations chairman to take care of the folks back home, as his
work on the military spending bill shows.
   He's also made clear that he will represent West Virginia
interests without any help from intermediaries. His anti-lobbying
bill was a reaction against the hiring of consultants by West
Virginia University to seek a government grant.
   But he's never far from the center of action.
   North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, reacting to a federally
supported exhibit including homosexual photographs, was tying the
Senate into knots in his effort to prohibit spending by the federal
arts agencies on anything that might be considered offensive.
   But when Helms tried to get the Senate to pass an amendment
instructing Byrd's committee against compromising with the House,
Byrd put his foot down.
   ``I am not going to follow the instructions of this amendment or
any other amendment or resolution that might be introduced on this
subject,'' Byrd declared. The Senate then tabled, or killed, the
Helms amendment.
   A House-Senate compromise emerged, much watered down from what
Helms wanted, which would establish a panel to oversee federal arts
endowment policy.
   A third of that panel will be appointed by the president, a
third by the speaker of the House, and a third by the president pro
tempore of the Senate _ Robert C. Byrd.

<HEAD>The Good and Bad of Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Junk bonds often get a bad rap from people who
forget that on occasion such financing tools have helped new
companies get started, weak companies grow strong, and small
companies grow big.
   But, as happens eventually to everything in the world of
creative finance, the notion has been abused. Rather than financing
sound enterprises, junk bonds often became vehicles for the pursuit
of greed, power and fanciful schemes.
   They have made certain individuals enormously and quickly
wealthy. They have put once-sound companies on the edge of
financial disaster. They have thwarted the growth of many
companies, and they've all but destroyed others.
   They have also shattered the dreams of many of those who bought
them in expectation of big profits, because now they must sit and
wait and wonder if the companies in which they invested will ever
be able to repay them.
   Default rates are rising, and conceivably could mount into still
another national financial disaster should a deep recession occur.
   There are about $200 billion of them out there, and they are
widely held. If a recession should occur it could ruin some
overleveraged companies and destroy values in pension funds,
stocks, mutual funds and college endowments.
   Short of a recession, there still could be serious problems for
holders. The junk bond market isn't as liquid as other markets;
there is no assurance that buyers are out there at any given time.
Given that, prices could fall.
   Several large issuers of junk bonds already are in default,
among them Dart Drug Stores and LTV, while others are in deep
trouble: Griffen Resorts, Seaman Furniture, Resorts International
and Integrated Resources.
   Defaults and moratoriums total $4 billion this year. The
nation's largest retailing empire, Campeau Corp., has come apart
only a year after it was put together with junk financing. Other
issuers survive by selling off parts.
   The picture needn't be painted entirely in somber tones of gray,
however, because some companies are bound to thrive, continue to
pay the high interest on their bonds and still have enough left in
the kitty to finance growth.
   Growth is the secret by which issuers of junk bonds hope to cast
off the burden of debt, but that growth has to be vigorous. Within
months, some issuers have discovered that the growth they
envisioned just wasn't there.
   When that happens, the company must think of cannibalizing
itself, or selling off parts to meet financial obligations. But the
consequence of that is often to further erode growth, thus
threatening a downward spiral.
   Prime Computer Inc., a Massachusetts computer maker that went
from sales of about $8.5 million in 1978 to about $1 billion 10
years later, was acquired in a leveraged buyout earlier this year
for $1.3 billion cash and junk bonds.
   With its growth record, its products, its reputation and its
ability to keep abreast of developments in its field, Prime
appeared to be a safe risk, a company capable of generating enough
cash to keep bondholders happy.
   This week the new owners of Prime, J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., sought to
slash costs by dismissing 2,500 workers, or 20 percent of Prime's
payroll, setting off speculation in the industry about the
company's future.
   If Prime cannot support good workers, how will it support good
products? Can it service its customers? Gain new ones? Can it
create new products to match the innovative equipment from its
vigorous competitors?
   Conceivably, Prime could get its big bills paid down in four or
five years, and then turn its energies to growth and greater
profitability. But until then, it will be carrying an interest-rate
burden that's like a dead-weight anchor.

   Tourists to Amish country often return
home with simple notions of the Amish as merely quaintly dressed
people who drive buggies.
   Their secluded ways have opened the Amish for decades to such
misconceptions and unchallenged commercial exploitation.
   As an antidote, a visitors center opened last year to offer
tourists a self-guided lesson of Amish and Mennonite church history
and culture.
   Perhaps surprisingly, the center has become a learning place for
Amish children and even adults. The founders had hoped this would
happen, but feared the secluded Amish would shun the modern
facility. The more worldly Mennonites have been strong supporters
of the project since the beginning.
   About half the Amish children in this region go to public
schools, with the other half attending much smaller Amish schools
where one instructor teaches first through eighth grade.
   Neither the public nor the Amish schools offer reliably thorough
training in Amish history, said Samuel Yoder, a former Amishman who
joined the Mennonite Church and now teaches at Goshen College.
   The result, he said, is that most Amish children have only
spotty knowledge of their cultural history of persecution in Europe
and the flight to religious freedom in the New World.
   ``They know a few facts, but not so much,'' Yoder said.
   So in small but growing numbers, Amish are visiting the center
to learn about their past.
   ``They say that this is a good program, and they have a real
appreciation for the accuracies of it,'' said Dan Beachy, a guide
at the center.
   In the 17th century, Mennonite Jakob Amman split from the
established church with his followers, the Amish, over doctrinal
matters. Both groups resisted the enforced teachings of the German
state-controlled church and state militarism, and members found
themselves persecuted for their beliefs.
   They began emigrating to North America, settling largely in
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.
   While the Mennonites have become known for their international
missions and disaster relief, the Old Order Amish have maintained
their separateness from modern society. They continue to wear plain
clothing and speak a dialect of German; they shun modern
conveniences such as electrical appliances, engined-powered farm
machinery and automobiles.
   These Amish ways caused their leadership to waver in its support
for the visitors center.
   ``Initially, before the design was finalized, there was a fair
amount of support from Amish leadership,'' said Tim Lichti, a
former Mennonite preacher who directs the center. ``Once they
discovered it was going to cost $1 million and have enough
bathrooms for 10 (people), they began to wonder if our commitment
to be non-commercial could be held.
   ``The official stance was a wait-and-see attitude. Since they
have toured the facility, they have become much more supportive.''
   Still there is ambivalence, and some resistance.
   The center uses audio tape and visual aids, modern devices
disapproved by the Amish, to tell its story.
   ``But they realize that's about the only way you get the story
across,'' Yoder said.
   Nevertheless, the reliance on tapes and slides puts Amish
leaders in an awkward position, Beachy said. While they may approve
of the center's mission, openingly supporting it could be
interpreted as an implicit endorsement of the modern devices, he
said.
   ``Individually, they feel good about it, but then to go out and
promote it _ they go pretty low-key on that,'' he said.
   Only one or two groups of children from the area's all-Amish
schools have been among the 67,000 visitors who have toured the
center since it opened last year. Most of the Amish student
visitors have come from public school groups. Lichti nevertheless
expects a growing number of Amish in the coming months.
   In response to the growing Amish acceptance of the center, the
board of directors is prepared to make a crucial modification in
the asphalt parking lot, Yoder said.
   ``We're now talking about putting in hitching racks, so that
when they come in their buggies, they can tie the horses.''

   Democrats have launched an autumn political
offensive, accusing President Bush of timidity _ which is a
slightly kinder way of saying wimp.
   It's a label Bush confronted and overcame when he was a
candidate. Now there is a toughening tone at the White House, and
from Bush's Republican allies in Congress, against the risk that
Democrats can revive the image as an issue by calling him a
hesitant, timid leader.
   Among other things, the president is vowing to stand, lobby and
fight for a capital gains tax reduction, something the leader of
Senate Democrats says he will not get.
   The House passed the tax measure as part of a budget bill, but
the Senate stripped it away and differences between te two bills
now are under negotiation. The White House said Bush will look for
the first opportunity to push the issue to a vote in the Senate,
where the administration claims it can get majority support in an
up or down test. Bush is expected to contact as many as 20 senators
in a personal lobbying drive for the tax cut he advocated as a
candidate.
   ``He's going to press for it and it's not the greatest issue of
our times, but it sure as hell is a campaign promise that he kept
and I think that's what people admire about him,'' said Sen. Alan
K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip.
   Another challenge to the Democrats: Vice President Dan Quayle
said Bush may pick an issue and try to veto one item in a composite
bill, thus claiming a power of line-item veto both he and Ronald
Reagan have sought.
   ``We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test
case,'' said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   With that power, Bush could, for example, have vetoed only the
abortion language in the appropriations bill he rejected last
Saturday because it provided federal funds for Medicaid abortions
in cases of rape or incest.
   The idea of forcing a legal challenge and a court decision on
whether a president already has the power to veto specific items is
not new business. It was discussed during the Reagan years, but
never pushed to a test.
   And nobody said it was going to happen this time. But raising
the prospect fits the strategy of counterattack, drawing a line
against the Democrats running Congress, where the power to build
hostage items into hard-to-veto bills always has been guarded
against administration inroads.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader,
sounded the Democratic offensive:
   ``The key to the current Republican strategy has been to
perpetuate a precarious status quo. Any great changes, even those
that might inure to America's benefit, are avoided at all costs.
Change is to be put off. The status quo is to be preserved.
   ``George Bush appears to be determined to go down in history as
the hesitation president,'' Gephardt said in a speech at the
National Press Club a week ago. ``At least his first year in office
could be entitled `The Year of Living Timidly.'''
   Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, leader of the Senate's Democratic
majority, already had accused Bush of ``timidity'' in dealing with
the opportunities opened by the move toward democracy in eastern
Europe.
   The House has voted to approve nearly twice as much aid for
Poland and Hungary as the administration proposed.
   Democratic leaders and more than a few Republicans complained at
administration inaction in the brief and futile Panamanian coup
against Manuel Noriega.
   Congress forced Bush into an abortion veto that could hurt
Republicans; the Democrats outmaneuvered him on flag-burning by
passing a law he didn't want and rejecting a constitutional
amendment he sought.
   ``For the last three weeks, as it becomes more and more obvious
that the Democratic leadership of the Congress can't get their job
done, they have been attacking President Bush more and more
aggressively,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip.
   For all of that, the Democrats have had trouble finding the
voices and the themes to compete with the White House. Gephardt
acknowledged the problem, saying that congressional Democrats must
present a cohesive program, not a batch of unconnected issues. He
said they're still trying, and hope to put together a consensus
Democratic agenda to be presented next year.
   First, Congress and the president will have to settle the
capital gains fight along with other major issues _ their rival
child care programs; a minimum wage bill to replace one Bush vetoed
as too high and might veto again because of his insistence on a
lower training wage for new workers; differences on how and how
much to spend fighting drugs; the stalled budget bill that has
forced automatic, if probably temporary, spending cuts.
   There's plenty there to test who's timid and who isn't.

   And who but Julia Child could get away with explaining yeast
dough in terms of burps: ``The main ingredients of flour are starch
and gluten. It's the starch in the dough that feeds upon the yeast,
belching forth gas that pushes up the gluten.''
   Child nurtures you through bread-baking, explaining how yeast
works, what flour to buy, what kneading is all about. Photographs
make it clear just how the dough should look along the way.
   And how can anyone resist trying a souffle when she writes:
   ``The souffle is undoubtedly the egg at its most magnificent,
the egg in all its puffing power. How impressive is the chocolate
or cheese souffle, its head rising dramatically out of its dish,
and swaying ever so slightly as it is borne to the table.''
   In a bow to health, she includes ``cream'' soups made with
pureed rice. But she also suggests adding heavy or sour cream ``if
you like.'' She also offers a fat-free ``heaven-sent'' poached
chicken and recommends a cast-iron grill to cook meat without fat.
   But she writes: ``I, for one, would rather swoon over a few thin
slices of prime beefsteak, or one small serving of chocolate
mousee, or a sliver of foie gras than indulge to the full on such
nonentities as fat-free gelatin puddings.''
   Child grew up in Pasadena, Calif., in a home with a hired cook,
and did not take a cooking lesson until she was in her 30s.
   She graduated from Smith College in 1934 and after writing
advertising copy for a short time, joined the Office of Strategic
Services, the forerunner of the CIA. She was sent off as a clerk to
Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where she met Paul Child, a career diplomat
10 years her senior, in 1943.
   They married in 1946 and remain very close; she often talks in
terms of ``we.'' He recently moved to a nursing home near their
Cambridge, Mass., home. They have no children.
   ``They just never came,'' she said matter-of-factly. ``I would
be very happy to be a grandmother at this point.'' But in addition
to her book, Child is busy these days working to improve the status
of food professionals through the American Institute of Wine and
Food, which she co-founded, and the James Beard Foundation in New
York.
   Two years after their marriage, the Childs were sent to Paris,
where she enrolled at the Cordon Bleu cooking school. She was
considered a bit odd by her friends, who all had hired help in the
kitchen.
   ``I'd been looking for my life's work all along. And when I got
into cooking I found it. I was inspired by the tremendous
seriousness with which they took it.''
   In France she also met Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, who
needed an American collaborator for the first volume of ``Mastering
the Art of French Cooking.'' Nine years in the making, it was
published in 1961 with a foreword that began: ``This is a book for
the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion
with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children's meals, the
parent-chauffeur-den mother syndrome, or anything else which might
interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to
eat.''
   And it ends: ``Above all, have a good time.''
   Two years later, when Child was 51, WGBH in Boston launched
``The French Chef'' series, and for 206 meals, she entertained and
cajoled and encouraged viewers to do as she did.
   ``I happened to be the right woman at the right time,'' she said
with modesty, noting that John F. Kennedy had a French chef at the
White House and more Americans were traveling abroad.
   ``Suddenly people began considering food with a capital `F'.''
   Besides, she was fun to watch, perhaps partly because of the
on-air disasters, the first of which occurred with an apple
charlotte.
   ``As I was looking, it did a slow collapse. You could hear the
tears in my voice.'' To cover, she told viewers: ``You don't want
it too stiff.''
   But the mistakes taught viewers how to make repairs, and made
her more familiar.
   And since it's the good company that counts, her advice to
others who make mistakes: ``Don't apologize ever. It's very bad to
apologize because people will say, `That wasn't very good, was it?'

<HEAD>Abortion: America's No-Win Political Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is America's most divisive social issue,
one that stirs the soberest reflections of private conscience, the
shrillest voices of public debate.
   So polarizing are the arguments over abortion, whether personal
or political, they can separate the warmest of lovers, young adults
from parents and grandparents, priests from their parishioners,
officeholders from their jobs.
   Some women, even some men, are separated from their sanity.
Suicide or years of melancholy are not unheard of, either as the
consequence of a lamented abortion or of a struggling mother's
anguish over her inability to provide for a child, perhaps woefully
deformed or handicapped, that she has brought into the world.
   The ethical complexities wear thick for some Americans, thin for
others. Some find their answers in faith, some in science, and some
in lonely desperation. At the heart of the furor is the question of
whether human life begins with a baby's first breath, or nine
months earlier with the microscopic conjunction of sperm and egg,
or somewhere in between with the emergence of a ``viable'' fetus.
   At the fringe of that theological and scientific riddle are the
ironies of fervor _ ``pro-life'' fanatics, for example, who risk
murder by bombing abortion clinics; or militant mothers, children
proudly in tow, marching for abortion rights.
   Each side claims the truth as its ally, and thus they agree on
precious few facts. But there is little argument about this:
Millions of American women, about one-fifth of those older than 15,
have had, and will have, abortions. According to the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a birth-control research group in New York
City, 1.6 million abortions are performed annually. Nearly
one-third of all pregnancies end in abortion.
   The issue separates the president of the United States from the
mainstream of public opinion, from the Congress and even from his
personal physician, Burton J. Lee III, who believes each woman is
entitled to decide for herself whether to bear a child.
   It also separates President Bush from the George Bush of a
decade ago, before he got religion from Ronald Reagan. In 1980, he
opposed Reagan's idea of a constitutional amendment to overturn the
Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision. Now, against all political
odds, he supports such an amendment.
   Other conservatives aren't waiting for a constitutional revision
_ which, to be realistic, is nowhere on the political horizon.
Instead, Reagan's Supreme Court has itself begun chipping away at
the ``Roe'' decision, the 1973 effort by Justice Harry Blackmun to
balance the government's interest in protecting life and a woman's
right to determine when _ and whether _ to have a child. At least
six states have new anti-abortion laws ready to take hold, pending
a go-ahead from the court.
   As a quiet battle rages within the justices' chambers, the
skirmishes outside the door are deafening. Advocates on either side
have marched by the tens of thousands upon the court, Congress,
state legislatures and even city halls. They wave blue-and-white
placards, with black-and-white aphorisms, frequently more insult
than idea. It is a single-issue crusade: Neither side much concedes
voters should judge anyone, president or sheriff or dogcatcher, by
any other standard. To one side, you are either ``pro-life' or you
condone or commit murder. To the other, you are either
``pro-choice'' or you are willing to trample a woman's rights and
threaten her health or even life.
   The Roe decision entitled all women to have abortions for any
reason within the first three months of pregnancy. In upholding a
restrictive Missouri law last summer, one declaring that life
begins at conception, the latest court re-opened the door for a
cornucopia of state efforts to legislate the issue.
   George Bush would allow only those women whose lives are
threatened by pregnancy, or those who are the victims of rape or
incest, to have abortions. But he will not sign federal legislation
to enable the poorest of sexually assaulted women to abort their
fetuses at government expense. In his view, tax dollars should not
be used to ``compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn
life.''
   Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, bitterly summarized the
president's position this way: ``He would give his daughter _ or
yours or mine _ every option. ... But if they cannot afford a
doctor, they must carry the unborn of that hateful act to term _
they have no choice.''
   Sadly, even the most destitute women do have an abortion choice
_ of sorts. It is essentially the same desperate option exercised
by many young, unmarried women back in the days when most states
banned abortions _ and when unwed mothers faced ostracism and could
be forced to turn their babies over for adoption. For them, an
abortion meant squalid procedures, sometimes self-administered,
with knitting needles, bleach and coat-hangers. For some, it meant
death.
   ``Women will have abortions, legal or not,'' says Molly Yard,
president of the National Organization for Women. ``The question is
whether they will be legal, medically safe and available to every
woman who needs one.''
   The vast majority of abortions are performed within the first 12
weeks of pregnancy, at walk-in clinics charging an average of only
$225 or so. Despite the modest cost, many women appear to be
resorting even now to amateur methods. Health officials in big
cities are finding that some are intentionally using crack cocaine
to induce uterine contractions. Others are trying megadoses of
vitamin C, exotic herbs, and a menstrual extraction method using a
Mason jar, aquarium tubing and other paraphernalia.
   Today's do-it-yourself techniques can be as hazardous as the old
coat-hanger abortions, physicians say. Moreover, they sometimes
damage the fetus rather than kill it. Drug-induced contractions can
separate the placenta from the uterine wall, causing oxygen
deprivation and a brain-damaged, rather than aborted, fetus.
Cocaine can trigger a heart attack in the mother, or cause the baby
to be born a drug addict.
   A woman who has plenty of money needn't worry about either her
safety or legal risk, no matter what course local jurisdictions
take. Some states, like New York, California, Washington and
Hawaii, seem certain to keep abortion legal for the indefinite
future. And there are always clinics to be found overseas; in
France, for example, a simple pill, known as the RU-486, can be
used to end pregnancy within five weeks of conception.
   But the travel alternative, while easy enough for the career
woman or affluent housewife with a pocketbook full of credit cards,
is out of the question for ghetto teen-agers, or welfare mothers
already struggling to support a roomful of kids. Thus the abortion
debate, while usually couched in medical or theological terms, has
a number of troubling class and racial overtones.
   According to the Guttmacher Institute, women below the poverty
level are more than three times as likely to have abortions as
women whose incomes exceed $25,000. An astonishing number, about
500,000 a year, are teen-agers. And because many lack access to
medical care early in pregnancy, they are more prone to seek
abortions in later stages _ when more legal restrictions are now
possible.

   The jitters that triggered the stock market
plunge on Friday the 13th crept back into financial markets,
causing wide price swings in stocks, depressing the dollar and
boosting demand for U.S. Treasury bonds.
   Speculation that a collapsed deal to buy United Airlines parent
UAL Corp. signaled a continued ebbing of the takeover tide that has
helped boost stock prices, and that a slowing economy would mean
weaker corporate profits, helped set the tone for the market
gyrations Tuesday, analysts said.

   UAL Corp. stock plunged again on word that United
Airlines' parent had backed away from an employee-management buyout
proposal, but rebounded as the stock market staged a volatile, late
rally.
   UAL finished down $8.37{ at $170 a share Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange, rallying on late buying interest after having been
down more than $32 early in the day. The closing price represented
just over half the $300-a-share amount offered in the buyout
group's original proposal.

   Car and truck sales in the United States
continued a slump, falling 20.5 percent in mid-October compared
with the same time last year.
   The eight major automakers with U.S. plants reported Tuesday a
19 percent decline in car sales and a 22.8 percent drop in light
truck sales in the Oct. 11-20 period. The reports were seen as
further evidence that strong sales in August and September came
partly from fear of 1990-model price increases and from incentives
designed to clear dealer lots for the new vehicles.

<HEAD>Report: Securities Commission To Fine Drexel Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Securities Commission has
decided to issue its largest-ever fine for fraud against the
defunct Spanish unit of the U.S. securities firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., a newspaper reported.
   Madrid's El Mundo daily said Tuesday the commission's directors
recently approved a 70-million-peseta, or $615,000, fine against
DBL Capital Markets Espana SA for ``very serious'' civil
infractions of trading rules.
   The paper said the commission must receive government approval
before issuing the fine, which at five times the illicit profits
earned represents the maximum penalty permitted under law.
   A spokesman for New York-based Drexel said: ``There's been no
official decision. It's still under consideration and obviously we
can't comment.''
   But sources said they believed the fine would be lower and that
a final decision was still some time away.
   Drexel, which recently pleaded guilty to unrelated fraud charges
in the United States and has pledged to toughen securities law
compliance, closed the 27-employee Spanish unit in July,
acknowledging ``improper behavior.''
   A Spanish commission probe confirmed that the Drexel unit
fraudulently made 400 applications for shares worth $59 million in
the April 20-May 6 partial privatization of the state-controled
Repsol S.A. oil firm, the paper said.
   The probe showed the Drexel unit used the names of private
citizens without their authorization to circumvent restrictions
designed to assure the widest distribution of shares, then sold the
acquired shares to 17 foreign institutional investors for a profit
of $123,000.
   The commission began its investigation in June after a private
individual said his bank had authorized the purchase of Repsol
shares without his knowledge.
   El Mundo said the U.S. parent company would be legally
responsible for paying the fine since the Spanish unit has been
liquidated.
   Drexel in September pleaded guilty to six U.S. felonies and
began paying $650 million in penalties to settle a range of
criminal securities fraud charges.

   The federal government has been too slow to
decide on proposals for stronger automobile safety standards, says
President Bush's choice to head the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   Jerry R. Curry, a retired Army major general and former deputy
assistant defense secretary, said at his Senate confirmation
hearing Tuesday he would set a goal of 18 months for the agency to
approve or reject new safety regulations.
   ``One area where I have been disappointed is in the length of
time it takes to complete a rulemaking action _ two years on the
average from start to finish,'' Curry told the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation, which took no vote on his
confirmation. In some cases it has taken years longer, he said.
   But Curry, who has been a consultant to the agency since March,
said its career employees were doing their jobs well. He backed the
Bush administration's opposition to pending legislation that would
set time limits for rulemaking on some transportation-safety issues.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, charged with
ensuring that vehicles meet minimum safety standards, drew
bipartisan accusations of laxity during the Reagan administration.
   ``It seemed to us in the past that oftentimes NHTSA has been
most subservient to ... ideological positions which seemed to say
`why should safety stand in the way of profit,''' Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., said.
   Committee chairman Richard D. Bryan, D-Nev., described the
agency in recent years as ``lethargic ... and some would say
derelict.''
   Senators closely questioned Curry about whether he had any
philosophical aversion to government intervention in the automobile
industry to promote safety.
   ``I bring nothing in the ideological nature to this job,'' Curry
said. ``To me, ths job has a very narrow focus. That focus is
saving lives.''
   Curry promised if confirmed to push the agency to conclude by
next summer its decade-long consideration of an improved
side-impact standard for passenger cars. Senators cited the delay
as the most flagrant example of what they called the agency's
foot-dragging.
   The agency began studying a side-impact standard in 1979 but
suspended action in 1982, only to renew its work last year,
Danforth said. An estimated 10,000 Americans are klled in
side-impact crashes each year, he said.
   Curry also promised action by the end of 1990 on proposals to
toughen standards for multipurpose vehicles such as small trucks
and minivans, for child booster seats, for improving pedestrian
safety, and for reducing head injuries caused by bumping into
interior components.
   Curry, 57, of Virginia Beach, Va., retired from the Army in
1984. Over the next two years, he was president of a non-profit
think tank on national issues. In 1988, Curry tried unsuccessfully
to unseat Rep. Owen B. Pickett, D-Va.
   If confirmed, Curry would be the first black administrator of
the agency, created in 1966.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate Agriculture subcommittee chairman has
accused the Agriculture Department of not sufficiently warning
farmers about the dangers of fertilizers and pesticides to
groundwater.
   The department's Extension Service ``calculates that 46 percent
of U.S. counties contain groundwater susceptible to contamination
from pesticides and fertilizers,'' said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.,
chairman of the subcommittee on conservation and forestry.
   He said Tuesday that wells are not systematically tested,
research is not keeping up with the problem and national data on
fertilizer and chemical damage to groundwater in each of the states
is not available.
   ``It should come as no surprise then, that farmers have poor
information on the consequences of the practices they employ _
beyond this year's yield,'' Fowler said.
   ``The U.S. Extension Service, which our farmers rely on for so
much of their information, has not taken adequate steps to educate
them about the possible consequences of polluting our water
supplies with pesticides and fertilizers,'' he said.
   Furthermore, he said, the extension service is not providing
much guidance to farmers about alternatives to chemical use.
   During a hearing on water quality, Fowler said he had recently
been informed that extension service agents were getting paid by
chemical companies to be consultants.
   Jay Vroom, of the National Agricultural Chemical Association,
said he had not heard of that happening, but said that the chemical
manufacturers have long relied on information from extension agents
and land grant universities.
   Terry Nipp, director of the water quality initiative at the
National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges,
said it's widely known that fertilizer and pesticide dealers have a
great deal of influence with how farmers use chemicals.
   ``Yet there is no national program to certify, train or provide
educational materials to the dealers,'' Nipp said in testimony to
the Fowler's subcommittee.
   He said the extension services would like to do more, but don't
have the money or personnel.
   Fowler asked Nipp why extension agents were criticizing the
system known as low intensity sustainable agriculture, which relies
on organic procedures for increasing yields and controlling pests.
   ``Like all institutions, there is a certain amount of inertia,''
said Nipp. But he said there have been some ``fairly religious
conversions'' by extension agents to organic methods.
   Fowler said he called the hearing to help determine what kind of
regulations pertaining to groundwater should be in the 1990 farm
bill.
   ``We simply cannot continue to encourage farmers to maximize
program benefits at the expense of the environment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A House committee has approved legislation
requiring the Federal Trade Commission to adopt new rules designed
to stem multibillion-dollar telephone sales fraud.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a voice vote
Tuesday, approved a bill by Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, that
would order the FTC to establish a minimum set of standards on
so-called telemarketing within 180 days.
   The rules must give buyers the right to change their minds
within a certain time after placing a phone order and require
refunds if the goods aren't delivered by a specified date.
   The FTC also must establish restrictions on the time of day when
phone solicitations may be made.
   In addition, the bill allows private citizens and state
officials to sue in federal court anyone who violates the new FTC
rules or commits telemarketing fraud; prohibits ``harassment'' of
customers by telemarketing firms and directs the commission to set
up an office to answer consumer questions.
   A nearly identical measure passed the House last year on a voice
vote but died in the Senate.
   Telephone fraud has grown widely in recent years as hustlers
offer phony prizes or try to sell goods such as gemstones and rare
coins or shoddy merchandise.
   Luken said the FTC had estimated there is $1 billion a year in
telemarketing fraud. Private estimates have put the figure much
higher, Luken added.
   ``The telephone is becoming an instrument to reach out and rob
someone,'' Luken said.
   The bill was designed to make telemarketing rules conform with
15-year-old FTC restrictions on door-to-door and mail-order sales,
said Benjamin Cohen, an aide to Luken.
   The commission earlier this month began formal proceedings to
extend the mail-order regulations to telephone sales.
   The bill had the support of the banking industry this year,
which has asserted it is losing several hundred million dollars a
year when dissatisfied customers stop payment on Visa or MasterCard
purchases made by phone, Cohen added.
   Before it approved the bill, the committee gave voice-vote
approval to an amendment offered by Rep. Thomas J. Manton, D-N.Y.,
that specifies that the new FTC rules will not apply to securities,
which are covered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The SEC two months ago adopted a ``penny stock'' rule requiring
that the buyer must give the seller written confirmation before the
sale is consummated.
   ``That's tougher than anything in our bill,'' Cohen said.
   In other action Tuesday, the committee, on a voice vote,
authorized $109.8 million for the Federal Communications Commission
in the 1990 fiscal year, the year that began Oct. 1, and $121.5
million next year, up from $99.6 million in the 1989 fiscal year.
   The FCC authorization was amended by Rep. Bill Richardson,
D-N.M., to allow the FCC to consider what impact its rulings may
have on U.S. trade.
   Richardson said the provision was a response to the decision
last month of the European Common Market to urge its 12 member
nations to broadcast television programs made in the market at
least 51 percent of the time, ``where practicable.''
   He said amendment was a ``strong signal'' that until foreign
telecommunications markets are completely open to U.S. companies,
the United States will be watching its own interests carefully.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee
earlier this month authorized $109.8 million for the FCC in 1990,
but only $119.8 million for 1991.
   The House committee also authorized $29.3 million for the
Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration for 1990 and 1991.

<HEAD>Americans in Moscow Will Be Able to Sleep at a Sheraton</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sheraton Moscow, a $75 million luxury
hotel, is slated to open by 1992, a few minutes away from from Red
Square, Soviet and U.S. officials announced.
   The hotel will be built in a ``privileged zone'' in the city
center, Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin said Tuesday at the
signing of a joint venture contract by Pan American World Airways,
ITT Sheraton, the Soviet airline Aeroflot and the Moscow city
government.
   The city will provide a piece of choice real estate, Sheraton
will supervise the construction and management of the hotel, and
Pan Am and Aeroflot hope to stimulate business.
   ``We look forward to flying many planeloads of customers to the
beautiful Moscow Sheraton,'' said Thomas G. Plaskett, chairman of
Pan Am Corp., parent of the airlines.
   In return, the city of Moscow will get a badly needed luxury
hotel, plus access to Western hard currency. Sheraton, a division
of ITT Corp., gets its foot in the door of a potentially large
Soviet market; the deal also gives Sheraton rights to renovate the
Bucharest, an older, smaller hotel on Petrovsky Street in Moscow.
   And the U.S. government is happy to have Sheraton Moscow as a
very visible American commercial enterprise on Gorky Street, one of
the main commercial thoroughfares in the Soviet capital.
   President Bush ``has said he wants perestroika to succeed,''
said Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, the senior U.S.
government official at the ceremony. ``This is an example of what
is needed to make perestroika succeed,'' he said, using the Russian
word for Soviet reforms.
   With 450 rooms at $200 a night or more, the hotel is meant
largely for American and European business travellers who until now
have had to choose between the worn but well-located hotels run by
the Soviet Intourist travel agency and the U.S.-built
Mezhdunarodnaya, several miles from the city center.
   The service and ambiance of the Intourist hotels are the subject
of frequent complaints from Western travellers.
   The Sheraton Moscow will employ about 650 people, most of them
Soviets who will be trained in hotel services by Westerners drawn
from Sheraton's network of Western European hotels, said John
Kapioltas, head of the ITT-Sheraton Corp.
   The hotel, to include an English pub and Italian, Japanese and
Russian restaurants, and a discoteque, will accept Western
currencies rather than the Soviet ruble, which on the black market
is worth about six times less than the conversion rate offered by
state-owned banks.
   The arrangement allows Sheraton to finesse an aspect of Soviet
law that has hampered previous such joint ventures, that Western
firms may repatriate only Western currency, and may not convert
rubles into hard currencies for transfer outside the Soviet Union.
   Sheraton and the city of Moscow each hold a 40 percent stake in
the joint venture, and Pan Am and Aeroflot hold 10 percent apiece,
officials said.
   Neogotiations are still under way to determine the exact amount
that each partner will invest in the construction, said Plaskett.
The Soviets are expected to supply workmen and raw materials, but
Sheraton will supervise construction and have the right to import
skilled craftsmen as needed, he said.
   The hotel will be located on Gorky Street in a block currently
occupied largely by residential units, Soviet officials said.
   Contractors will preserve the facade of the existing buildings,
and ``the street will be preserved to take into account the
architectural character'' of the district, one of most historic in
Moscow, said Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin.

<HEAD>Government Officials Cool to Airline Takeover Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alfred A. Checchi, who headed a group that
acquired the parent of Northwest Airlines Inc., says the fear that
debt-financed airline takeovers sacrifice safety is ``misleading.''
   Testifying before a House panel Tuesday, the Los Angeles
investor said ``a well-maintained fleet is in fact a far more
cost-effective fleet to operate.''
   His testimony came before a subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee that is looking into the tax policy aspects of
mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in the airline industry.
   Earlier in the day, senior Transportation and Treasury
department officials told a House panel that proposed legislation
to restrict airline takeovers wouldn't be good for the industry or
the country.
   Checchi added that every deal is different and one
across-the-board rule would be ``naive and short-sighted.''
   He said that ``the kind of person who would _ if he could _ cut
back on maintenance procedures to save money would do this
irrespective of what his company's capital structure might be.''
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the oversight
subcomittee, said the panel was looking into whether ``tax
provisions have made the airlines more desirable and more
susceptible to takeover activity.''
   To combat that, another subcommittee member, Rep. Byron L.
Dorgan, D-N.D., introduced legislation that would prohibit airlines
purchased in leveraged buyouts from deducting interest payments
from their taxes.
   Last week, a House committee voted to give the Transportation
Department the authority to block a major airline takeover if it
would jeopardize safety, hinder the company's ability to compete or
put it in the hands of a foreign carrier.
   But a top Transportation Department official said the agency
``neither needs nor wants such authority.''
   Patrick V. Murphy Jr., deputy assistant secretary of
transportation for policy and international affairs, said the
department ``would object strongly to any legislation that might
inappropriately interfere with the free flow of capital in the
airline industry or with allowing the dynamics of the marketplace
to determine the capital structure of airlines.''
   Murphy said his boss, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner,
has told Congress that senior advisers ``will recommend to the
president that he veto any such legislation.''
   Another government official, John G. Wilkins, said the Treasury
Department opposes ``any legislative attempt to single out and
address concerns regarding leveraged buyouts in a specific
industry.''
   ``The tax code is generally too blunt an instrument to draw
distinctions between good and bad debt or between good and bad
LBOs,'' said Wilkins, a senior economic adviser in the Treasury's
Office of Tax Policy.
   He added that his department does not favor ``special income-tax
rules for airlines or for any other specific industry.''
   In his testimony, Checchi said the $4 billion takeover of NWA
Inc., the parent of Northwest, was not motivated by tax factors.
   ``If the tax treatment of debt had been changed to make the
after-tax cost of interest greater, I do not necessarily feel that
this would have discouraged the acquisition of Northwest,'' he
said. ``The fundamental attractiveness of Northwest as a business
would remain unchanged.''
   Checchi also said that while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was part
of the group that bought NWA, ``We ceded no control of Northwest to
KLM.''
   He noted that KLM got only 5 percent of the voting stock and one
out of 12 seats on the board of directors.
   ``Each acquisition and acquirer should be evaluated
individually,'' he told the panel.

<TEXT>
   A plunge, and then a late rally, in UAL Corp.
stock is keeping many eyes on the parent company of United
Airlines, despite its board's insistence that it is backing away
from an immediate sale.
   In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL
finished down $8.37{ at $170 a share, rallying on late buying
interest after dropping more than $32 early in the day.
   The closing price represented just over half the $300 a share
originally offered by a buyout group that included UAL's management
and pilots.
   The United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association said
Tuesday it was undaunted in its quest for an employee-owned airline.
   ALPA spokesman Hank Krakowski said the late rally in UAL's stock
price might be a sign of possible takeover interest from outside.
   ``We told our pilots tonight on the telephone hotline that we
know, from sources, that someone is accumulating UAL stock, but who
that is we do not know,'' Krakowski said.
   The company's board said late Monday the Chicago-based airline
would remain independent while directors examine alternatives to
the $6.75 billion offer that collapsed earlier this month.
   Pat Friend, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight
Attendants, another union involved in the original buyout attempt,
said her union was not happy with the board's stand.
   ``We don't know what anyone's going to do at this point in
time,'' Friend said. ``All we're saying is that we believe the
board of directors have made a mistake because they have not taken
any action to protect the company from hostile takeovers.''
   Airline analyst Stephen Dexter with Kemper Financial Services
Inc. said the UAL board's statement gives the pilot-management
group breathing room to regroup and possibly come back with another
buyout proposal.
   ``All the messages here are, `Let's take a breather, stand back,
let management run the company.' It's a holding pattern until a
firm bid hits the table,'' Dexter said.
   Krakowski said the pilots continued to work behind the scenes in
an attempt to put together another package.
   ``The players, the pilots, their financial advisers ... haven't
packed up their bags and gone home by any means,'' he said. ``We'll
just regroup and see what we can do in the future.''
   Robert Decker, an airline analyst with the Chicago investment
firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., said the decline in UAL's stock is
``making any potential bid cheaper all the time. It's just a
reaction to the board's decision to do nothing.''
   And the more the stock price falls, the more attractive UAL is
to hostile raiders, Decker said.
   Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading early Tuesday, in
part due to concerns about UAL, though there was some recovery
after noon. The pilot-management group's announcement Oct. 13 that
it was unable to obtain financing for its bid helped trigger a
190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average and launched
the downward slide for UAL.
   The widely followed market index finished down 3.69 Tuesday at
2,659.22 after a day of volatile movement.
   In addition to the inability to raise financing, the buyout
suffered another major setback last week when British Airways PLC _
which was to contribute $750 million in equity in exchange for a 15
percent stake in UAL _ pulled out of the buyout group.

   Speculation that the hot pace of car and truck
sales in late summer would cool is coming true, with automakers
reporting a 20.5 percent drop in vehicle sales in mid-October
compared with the same period last year.
   Part of the analysts' predictions of weak sales in October came
from consumers' fear of price increases for 1990-model cars, which
were introduced this month, and attractive buyer incentives in
August and September.
   The combination apparently proved too much to resist for some
consumers who had planned to buy cars this fall. Car sales reported
Tuesday by the Big Three automakers fell more than 20 percent each,
with light truck sales not far behind.
   The eight major automakers with U.S. plants said they sold
vehicles at an average daily rate of 28,156 during Oct. 11-20,
compared with a rate of 35,407 during the same time last year.
Overall car sales were off 19 percent while truck sales were down
22.8 percent.
   As the 1990 model year opened, automakers announced price
increases they blamed mostly on federal safety requirements,
including driver-side air bags or automatic safety belts.
   General Motors Corp. announced a 3.4 percent average price
increase for its 1990 model cars, Ford Motor Co.'s prices rose an
average of 4.9 percent and Chrysler Corp.'s went up 5 percent on
average.
   The manufacturers also carried over cash rebates or low-interest
financing packages to some 1990 cars and trucks, but they didn't
match the level of incentives on 1989 models.
   Some dealers still have 1989 cars and trucks in stock, but the
majority sold now are 1990 models.
   The mid-October sales decline, when tacked on to the 11.9
percent drop in early-October sales figures, worked out to a 16.5
percent decline in vehicle sales during the first 20 days of the
month compared with the same period last year.
   ``We borrowed some business from October, November and
December,'' said Herb Adcox, owner of Herb Adcox Chevrolet in
Chattanooga, Tenn., and the incoming treasurer of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. ``That usually happens when you
have a strong close (to the model year) like this.''
   In September, car and light truck sales by the eight companies
were up 8.2 percent over the same month last year. In August,
vehicle sales were up 13.1 percent compared with August 1988.
   So far this calendar year, car and truck sales are running 2
percent behind the last year's pace, the second-best on record. Car
sales are down 3 percent and light-truck sales were down 0.2
percent.
   GM reported its car sales were down 24.8 percent during
mid-October compared with last year, while GM's light truck sales
were off 26 percent. For the year-to-date, GM's car sales were down
6.8 percent while truck sales were up 1.4 percent.
   Ford said its mid-October car sales ran 21.2 percent behind last
year and truck sales were down 24.2 percent. For the year, Ford's
car sales were 0.6 percent behind last year and truck sales were
down 2.7 percent.
   Mid-October car sales at Chrysler were down 23.7 percent and
truck sales were off 17.5 percent. Since the first of the year,
Chrysler's car sales were 11.5 percent behind last year and truck
sales were down 0.4 percent.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for the second period of October 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year, and 247 selling days so far this year,
compared with 248 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Ford Files Notification That It May Go After All of Jaguar</HEAD>

   Ford Motor Co. says it's ready, more than a year
early, to bid for all of Jaguar PLC's outstanding stock, but that
it may not go after the British luxury carmaker when the time comes.
   Ford apparently will have to wait until the end of next year
before it could move to acquire more than 15 percent of the company
because of an ownership roadblock written into Jaguar's bylaws.
   A suitor can acquire more than 15 percent of the stock before
then, but it must be approved by Jaguar's board of directors. And
that seems unlikely in Ford's case.
   The notification by Ford on Monday to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it was prepared to bid for all of the
stock stemmed from an SEC requirement, said Ford spokeswoman Lin
Cummins.
   ``It is a legal requirement by the SEC that once you became a 5
percent stockholder in the company, you have to disclose your
intentions concerning the issuer, which is Jaguar,'' she said.
``It's not saying that we are going after it.''
   Ford and General Motors Corp. have made separate moves to
acquire chunks of Jaguar _ Ford through stock purchases that Jaguar
has called unwelcome and GM through friendly negotiations with
company.
   GM and Ford, the nation's Nos. 1 and 2 automakers respectively,
apparently want a luxury automobile to add to their stables, and
Jaguar, which has fallen on tough financial times, seems to fit the
bill.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Ford stock fell 75 cents a share
to close at $49.125 Tuesday, and Jaguar's American depositary
receipts rose 12.5 cents to close at $11.25 in over-the-counter
trading.
   On Tuesday, Ford reported a 22.4 percent decline in sales of its
cars and light trucks during mid-October compared with the same
time last year. Jaguar, like other overseas automakers, won't
report U.S. sales until the first of next month.
   Because of Jaguar bylaws, no outside individual or company may
acquire more than 15 percent of its stock before Dec. 31, 1990,
without a vote by Jaguar's board of directors. After that date,
there are no provisions in place that would thwart a hostile
takeover through stock purchases.
   Jaguar has said it wants to remain independent.
   Ford announced Sept. 19 that it planned to acquire 15 percent of
Jaguar's stock, and received U.S. regulatory approval for the
purchase. By Monday, Jaguar said Ford had accumulated 21.9 million
shares, or about 12 percent, of the company's outstanding stock.
   A Ford move to acquire all of Jaguar's stock may be dealt a blow
sooner than the end of next year.
   Jaguar Chairman John Egan has said he hopes to make an
announcement to shareholders within a month about the matter,
spokesman Tom McDonnell of Jaguar's U.S. subsidiary said Tuesday.
   It is possible that such an announcement would involve GM, which
reportedly has been negotiating to buy up to 30 percent of Jaguar
stock within the next few years.
   ``We are continuing in our discussions with Jaguar regarding
several possible business arrangements, including manufacturing,
marketing and other activities,'' GM spokesman Ron Theis said
Tuesday. He said Egan said last week the discussions included a
product for the European market.
   ``We have declined to get any more specific than that,'' Theis
said.

   Nintendo of America Inc. will get a hand from
Pepsi-Cola Co. in promoting its portable video ``Game Boy'' that
analysts say could be one of the most popular presents under
Christmas trees this year.
   But Nintendo says the transistor radio-sized, handheld device
has such blockbuster potential that the company won't have enough
of them this Christmas to meet even half of the projected demand.
   ``We expect to sell out,'' said Bill White, director of
advertising and public relations for the U.S. subsidiary of Japan's
Nintendo Co. Ltd.
   White said Nintendo forecasts the holiday demand for Game Boy at
2 million to 2.5 million units. Nintendo will ship just over 1
million units, and another 4 million to 5 million next year, he
said.
   Pepsi and Nintendo announced Tuesday they would team up in a
two-month promotion starting Nov. 1 during which Pepsi will award
more than 4,000 Game Boys to consumers.
   For Pepsi, the campaign could be a bonanza if it encourages many
more consumers to buy Pepsi beverages for a chance to obtain what
could become a hard-to-find holiday gift.
   ``We hope to be in the forefront of consumers' minds during the
holidays,'' Pepsi-Cola spokesman Tod MacKenzie said Tuesday. ``We
hope to make the Pepsi brand name synonymous with the hottest toy
of the holiday season.''
   Toy industry analysts agree that Nintendo appears to have
another big hit on its hands with Game Boy, which retails for
$89.95. Nintendo's entertainment system that turns a television
into a game screen dominates the home-computer-game business.
   Angela Bourdon, spokeswoman for retailer Toys R Us, said Game
Boy has been a strong seller since its release in August.
   ``It's the No. 1 best seller for Christmas,'' she said. ``Hands
down.''
   Kathy Ellis, a retail analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York, had a similar view. ``The Game Boy is going to have a
tremendous Christmas,'' she said.
   Added Frank Reysen, editor of Playthings Magazine, ``People are
asking if this is the next Cabbage Patch,'' referring to the dolls
that were a toy industry sensation in the mid-1980s.
   Reysen said he doubts Game Boy will achieve megahit status in
the same league as the Cabbage Patch dolls. With such a hefty
pricetag, Game Boy won't be for everyone.
   But Reysen said Game Boy could trigger a turnaround in the
handheld video game category, which has been in the doldrums for
several years. Game Boy uses interchangeable cartridges _ but not
the same ones as used on Nintendo's regular TV-based system.
   Pepsi's $10 million promotion with Nintendo will be supported by
radio and television advertisements plus in-store,
point-of-purchase displays. Pepsi said it would create special TV
and radio ads for network and local broadcasts.
   Customers will have a chance at winning a Game Boy or certain
other items through an instant-win, under-the-cap giveaway on
specially marked packages of Pepsi products. The other prizes
include Nintendo Action Sets, U-Force Remotes for use with the
Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Game Paks, $5 Nintendo
vouchers and free coupons for two-liter Pepsi products.
   The contest will be featured on 16-oz. non-returnable,
one-liter, two-liter and three-liter packages of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi,
both diet and regular Caffeine Free Pepsi, Moutain Dew and
Lemon-Lime Slice.
   Pepsi is hoping this year's holiday promotion will have results
similar to last year's, when Pepsi sponsored the home video release
of MCA-Universal's ``E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial'' and offered
special $5 rebates.
   According to Pepsi, the 1988 promotion generated a record 1.6
million rebates and helped ``E.T.'' become the highest-selling home
video in history.

   The dollar was mostly lower in early European
trading today. Gold prices rose.
   Trading was quiet, and foreign currency dealers said the market
was waiting to hear what U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan would say about monetary policy in testimony before the
U.S. House banking subcommittee later in the day.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 141.55 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 141.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.8374 West German marks, down from 1.8390;
1.6121 Swiss francs, up from 1.6120; 6.2415 French francs, down
from 6.2475; 2.0723 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0860; 1,347.75
Italian lire, down from 1,349.00; 1.1712 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1723.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6080 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6065 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $368.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $367.75. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $368.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $368.30 compared with $367.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.72 to close at a bid $386.63.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.14 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.12.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Down In Tokyo</HEAD>

   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today and stock prices fell in afternoon trading, erasing
earlier gains.
   The dollar finished trading at 141.55 yen, down 0.55 yen from
Tuesday's close of 142.10 yen. After opening at 141.57 yen, it
stayed in a narrow range between 141.40 and 141.79 yen.
   ``Recently the U.S. currency hasn't been falling much in Tokyo
because Japanese investors still have large dollar demands,'' said
Yuji Nakao, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   But he said traders in other countries had become less
interested in the dollar because of recent declines in U.S.
interest rates.
   Lower interest rates in a country tend to make its currency less
attractive to investors.
   Japanese participants also were concerned about recent losses on
the New York Stock Exchange following its big plunge two weeks ago,
he said.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed
84.15 points, or 0.24 percent, ending the day's trading at
35,442.40. The index, which lost 58.97 points the previous day,
gained 71.90 points in the morning, but fell back in afternoon
trading.
   The index started falling as investors began selling issues to
take profits from the morning gains, dealers said.
   ``Many participants also stepped off to the sidelines to wait to
see the performance of the New York market tonight,'' said Kazuhiro
Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co. Ltd.
   The New York Stock Exchange's Dow Jones industrial average of 30
major issues lost about 80 points on Tuesday, its largest tumble
since Oct. 13, when it fell more than 190 points.
   Nomura said arbitrage deals by some participants to make profits
from price gaps between the spot and futures markets also helped
cause the Nikkei's afternoon fall.
   But he said there were no negative economic elements in the
Tokyo market discouraging participants.

<HEAD>Oversupply of New Cars Won't Affect Saturn, Company President Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A projected glut of new cars over the
next two years won't affect production plans at General Motors
Corp.'s Saturn plant because the compact model will attract buyers
of imports, Saturn's president said.
   ``We're not after people who are already driving Chevrolets.
We're after the import buyers,'' R.G. ``Skip'' LaFauve said Tuesday.
   LaFauve refused to provide production figures for the new car,
but said its design had been refined and it will compete directly
against the Toyota Corolla.
   LaFauve and Richard Hoalcraft, international representative for
the United Auto Workers, participated in the state Department of
Labor's second annual Labor-Management Conference here Tuesdy.
   They spent much of their time talking about the company's
relationship with its workers. The Saturn plant, which is scheduled
to begin production next summer, will operate under an innovative
labor-management agreement.
   The new approach includes union participation in much of the
decision-making involved in plant operations, LaFauve said. Union
members participated in decisions on equipment design, suppliers,
and even the selection of Saturn's advertising agency.
   At full capacity, about 3,000 people will work at the plant,
under construction in Spring Hill, about 40 miles southwest of
Nashville.
   Hoalcraft said the labor-management arrangement is
``participatory membership where I look out for your stakes and
equity as a member of the union and you look out for my stakes and
equity.''
   ``We have geared ourselves to do what's right for the business _
none of this wrangling,'' Hoalcraft said.

<HEAD>Two New Roadsters Introduced by Mercedes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GROSSE POINTE SHORES, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of new two-seat
roadsters and a new four-wheel-drive sedan and station wagon will
lead Mercedes-Benz's fight to hold its share of the growing luxury
car market, a company executive says.
   Eric Krampe, president and chief executive officer of
Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., said Tuesday he expected the
luxury market to grow to about 840,000 cars next year, about 10,000
more than 1989 sales.
   Krampe also said he expected the company to keep or slightly
increase its 75,000-car-a-year sales pace of 1989. The four cars
that the West German automaker introduced will lead a list of 17
models into the next decade.
   The 300SL, with a base price of $73,500, and the 500SL, which
costs $10,000 more, replace the Mercedes 560SL, a roadster the West
German automaker had been producing for 18 years.
   Mercedes also is selling a sedan and a station wagon, carrying
300E and 300TE designations respectively, with automatically
engaging four-wheel-drive, a first for the company.
   Some of the competition Mercedes will face in 1990 will come
from Japan.
   Toyota Motor Corp. last month began selling its Lexus luxury
cars and next month, Nissan Motor Corp. will begin selling its
Infiniti line.
   ``They will try to take customers from the United States
(automakers) as well as Europeans,'' Krampe said. ``What the effect
will be still has to be seen. There is no clear picture yet.
   ``We do view them with a lot of respect,'' he said. ``We believe
they will be worthy competitors.''
   The median price for a Mercedes in 1989 was about $45,000,
Krampe said, slightly above the $40,000 price for the
top-of-the-line Lexus or Infiniti model. Krampe doubted speculation
that the Japanese companies were keeping their prices low in order
to grab larger shares of the U.S. luxury-car market.
   ``They are certainly out with an interesting price,'' he said.
``I think it would be very disrespectful to say they buy market
share. I'm not happy that they're around at these prices, but I
understand why.''
   Krampe said he expected the two new SL models to account for
about 8,000 in sales apiece and the four-wheel-drive cars, called
4Matic, will account for about 1,000 in sales each.
   The four-wheel-drive system is a complex series of sensors that
automatically add front-wheel-drive to existing rear-wheel-drive
when certain limits of wheel spin, engine speed and other factors
are passed. Drivers have to do nothing for the system to engage or
disengage.
   Next year, Mercedes plans to introduce two new turbodiesel cars,
which should amount to about 4,000 in sales in 1990. Krampe
acknowledged reports that the new turbodiesels do not meet
stringent California air quality standards, meaning that the state
with some of the company's largest markets will be off limits for
the diesel cars.
   The rest of the country, he said, accounts for 75 percent of
Mercedes sales.

<HEAD>Japanese Officials Oppose U.S. Proposals for Free Farm Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry and
fisheries on Wednesday opposed new U.S. proposals for the
liberalization of farm trade, saying they were impractical.
   Michihiko Kano told a Parliament committee, ``We believe there
are some problems in the realization of the U.S. proposals from a
standpoint of the world agricultural situation and the position in
which Japanese farmers are being placed,'' a parliamentary official
said.
   ``Japan will maintain its current stand,'' particularly its
policy of self-sufficiency in rice, the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, quoted Kano as saying.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter announced in Washington Tuesday a four-point
package calling for all farm trade import barriers to be turned
into tariffs and gradually reduced over 10 years, and for the
abolishment of all export subsidies in five years.
   Under the proposals, to be submitted Wednesday to international
farm trade liberalization talks in Geneva, Japan would be able to
protect its rice production with a high tariff at first, but would
have to gradually lower it to nearly zero in 10 years.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told the parliamentary committee
the government would continue to implement a policy of
self-sufficiency on rice.
   Japanese officials maintain that rice, as a staple food, should
be protected, and that Japan should continue its policy for
security reasons.
   The Japanese government regulates the domestic rice market,
buying much of the rice produced by Japanese farmers and reselling
it to consumers at lower prices, which are still several times the
world market level.

   Statistics showing that black mortgage
applicants are rejected twice as often as whites indicate federal
regulators aren't trying hard enough to enforce discrimination
laws, a Senate Banking subcommittee chairman says.
   ``The problem today is not lack of laws, it is lackluster
enforcement,'' said Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., chairman of the
consumer and regulatory affairs panel.
   Blacks applying for mortgages at savings institutions are
rejected approximately twice as often as whites, according to data
collected since 1978 by the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   However, Robert J. Herrmann, senior deputy at the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, said only 16 of the 37,000 written
complaints received by his agency between January 1987 and August
1989 alleged racial discrimination in mortgage lending.
   All 16 were investigated and no violations were found, he said.
   Studies by the Federal Reserve Board show that predominantly
black neighborhoods in Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland and Detroit
received fewer home purchase loans than white neighborhoods with
similar income levels.
   ``I'm not a statistician, but when blacks are getting their loan
applications rejected twice as often as whites ... I conclude that
discrimination is part of the problem,'' Dixon said Tuesday.
   Regulators told his panel the data doesn't prove violations by
financial institutions, which are prohibited from discriminating
against potential borrowers on the basis of race, sex, religion,
national origin or family status.
   Jonathan L. Fiechter, senior deputy director of the thrift
office, said the statistics ``only suggest the possibility of
unequal treatment'' because they don't include information on the
income or credit worthiness of mortgage applicants.
   John P. LaWare, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said
differences in lending to black and white neighborhoods could be
explained in part by differences in demand for mortgages.
   Moreover, regulators said their examinations find few banks not
living up to their obligations.
   John F. Bovenzi, deputy to the chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., said only 21 of 6,515 banks examined for redlining
violations in 1986, 1987 and 1988 received less than satisfactory
ratings.
   Herrmann and LaWare said discrimination is often difficult to
detect because it can occur when institutions subtly discourage
loan applications from minorities. When there are no applications,
there are no audit trails for examiners to follow, they said.
   Allen J. Fishbein, general counsel for the Center for Community
Change, an activist group in Washington, said the Department of
Housing and Urban Development could remedy that by expanding its
use of ``testers.''
   ``Testing'' is an investigative technique using matched pairs of
homeseekers _ minority and non-minority _ who are otherwise
similarly qualified. Financial institutions have resisted the use
of that tactic even though it is already used to detect
discrimination by real estate and rental agents.

   The stock market was mixed today in an
atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's volatile session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.35 to 2,652.87
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in the early tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 497 up, 461 down and 479
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.95 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in
early trading Tuesday, and then rebounded to recoup most of its
loss.
   Analysts said that typified the recent volatile behavior that
has put many investors on their guard.
   In addition, traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in
advance of the government's report Thursday morning on the gross
national product for the third quarter of the year.
   The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic
growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but
also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped \ to
44\; McDonald's slipped ] to 32]; General Electric lost [ to 55|,
and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up [ at 43[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.23 to 189.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .18 at 376.18.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished with
a loss of 3.69 at 2,659.22.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 7 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 360 up, 1,213 down and 381 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 237.96 million shares, against 135.86
million in the previous session.

   The new head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission told a congressional panel today the handling of Wall
Street's 190 point plunge on Oct. 13 shows ``the value of the
market improvements adopted during the past two years.''
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who noted ``I was sworn into
office just two weeks ago today,'' was the star witness before a
House panel on market reform, his first public appearance since
taking office.
   It also was Breeden's first public questioning since the Dow
Jones industrial average plunged 190.58 points on Oct. 13.
   The Dow Jones average, a key market indicator, rebounded to
close up 88.12 points the following Monday. After a week of gentler
fluctuations, it seesawed again Tuesday, finishing the day with a
slight decline of 3.69 points at 2,659.22.
   ``We learned important lessons from the market turbulence of
Oct. 13 and Oct. 16 and the market's responses to it,'' Breeden
said in testimony prepared for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee's telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
   ``The volume surges and volatility experienced on those two days
exemplify fundamental changes in our markets; they were not
isolated instances. We should not panic in the face of these
events, however. For what was demonstrated on Oct. 13 and 16 was
the strength and resiliency of the nation's markets.''
   He noted that more shares were traded in one hour during the
Oct. 13 slide ``than were traded on the average full day in 1985''
and three times the market's average daily volume 10 years ago.
   Breeden also said communication among the financial markets was
excellent and circuit-breakers, temporary trading halts in options
to slow market volatility also worked well.
   Legislation is pending in both the Senate and the House that
would expand the SEC's powers to monitor the markets in several
ways, some of them opposed by various segments of the industry and
one _ giving the SEC the power to halt trading in emergencies _
opposed by Breeden himself.
   The other proposed changes include giving the SEC authority to
request reports on large securities and options trades. This power
would enhance the SEC's surveillence abilities to track who's
trading what to whom. Another would require rules for assessing the
financial soundness of holding companies that are the parent
companies of broker-dealers.
   The other witnesses slated to testify are: Edward I. O'Brien,
president of the Securities Industry Association, a trade
association representing 600 securities firms; and George S.
Bissell, chairman of the Boston-based Keystone Group of mutual
funds.
   The market reforms proposed by Congress include giving the SEC
chairman the authority to halt trading for up to 24 hours in
emergenies. Currently, only the president can order such a shutdown.
   But Breeden has said he does not want that power and does not
think it should be exercised.
   In written answers to Senate staffers' questions during
confirmation hearings for the SEC post, Breeden said such authority
would create too much uncertainty about when the markets would
close and for how long.
   ``In a crisis, this uncertainty and the related rumors
concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse
consequences,'' he wrote last month.

   Wall Street took on a calmer tone today
following Tuesday's roller-coaster ride in which stock prices swung
wildly, depressing the dollar and boosting demand for U.S. Treasury
bonds.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 6.35 to 2,652.87
in the first half hour of trading today. But in the broader market,
rising stocks held a small edge over losers.
   The Dow average plummeted as much as 85 points on Tuesday before
rebounding and closing down 3.69 points at 2,659.22.
   Analysts said the tone for Tuesday's market gyrations was set by
two factors: speculation that a collapsed deal to buy United
Airlines parent UAL Corp. signaled a continued ebbing of the
takeover tide, and concern that a slowing economy would lead to
weaker corporate profits.
   On Wall Street, program trading strategies involving millions of
shares of stock helped accentuate wild declines and rebounds in
stock prices, some analysts said.
   ``It was almost all computerized program trading that gave us
tremendous violent price swings,'' said Dennis E. Jarrett, a
technical analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``I don't think you
could put your finger on any underlying economic statistic.''
   In other financial markets Tuesday, the dollar ended lower
against most major currencies, moving in tandem with the stock
market and reflecting concern from foreign investors about the
shakiness of the U.S. financial markets.
   But U.S. Treasury bonds posted moderate gains, with the
bellwether 30-year bond up { point, or $5 per $1,000 face amount.
Treasury bonds, which are guaranteed by the government, are
considered a safe haven at times of financial instability.
   Stock market observers initially attributed the downturn to the
decision late Monday by UAL to forego an employee-management buyout
for the time being, and a surge Tuesday in computerized program
selling involving stock-index futures.
   In such program selling, traders using sophisticated computer
programs take advantage of minute price discrepancies between
stock-index futures and the actual stocks on which the futures
contracts are based.
   The UAL buyout group's Oct. 13 announcement that it couldn't
raise financing for its $6.75 billion bid, and program selling that
followed, were considered key factors in the Dow's 190-point plunge
that day. Stocks regained much of their losses last week, however.
   ``It's certainly reminiscent of Friday the 13th ... although
it's not a replay,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer
for First Albany Corp. in Albany.
   Analysts said program trades dominated Tuesday's buying and
selling.
   ``I didn't see a lot of individuals, or even institutions,
participating,'' said Johnson. ``By and large they seemed to be
fence sitting.''
   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and director of technical
research at Gruntal Financial Inc., said program trading was
accelerating the current bearishness apparent in the stock market.
   ``What we have here is an intermediate correction in an
otherwise bull market,'' he said. ``(But) we've just seen it happen
in a matter of days instead of weeks as we normally do.
   ``We're getting compressed moves both on the upside and the
downside ... due to program trading.''
   Johnson said the fixation on the collapse of the UAL buyout
represented concerns about the future of leveraged buyouts.
   ``It's not the final nail in the coffin of leveraged buyouts or
acquisitions, but it's pretty darn close to it,'' he said. ``The
LBO business had been the principal drive of the stock market for
most of 1988 and 1989.''
   Analysts also pinned the blame on the lower stock prices on
weakness in the economy and its effects on corporate profits. Those
concerns were magnified by a government report Tuesday showing that
orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods declined 0.1 percent during
September.
   ``The economy's heartbeat is not very strong and that isn't good
news for stocks,'' said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus
Research in New York.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today he opposes a bill that would subject the central bank to more
supervision from Congress and the administration.
   However, congressional supporters of the measure said it was
needed to make the secretive central bank more accountable for its
actions, which can have enormous impact on the $5 trillion U.S.
economy.
   ``The Federal Reserve must take actions that, while sometimes
unpopular in the short run, are in the long-run best interests of
the country,'' Greenspan said, adding that ``the independence of
the Federal Reserve has, in practice, served the country well.''
   Greenspan was the lead-off witness as a House Banking
subcommittee opened hearings to examine how the central bank and
its chairman, often called the second most powerful man in America,
reach decisions on setting interest rates.
   Greenspan said the Fed was opposed to a bill sponsored by Reps.
Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., which would require
Fed officials to meet at specified times with the administration
and release immediately results of its closed-door deliberations.
   While rejecting these proposals, Greenspan did endorse another
measure sponsored by Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., that would write
into law that the Fed's chief mission is to eliminate inflation and
establish a deadline of 1994 for having done so.
   Greenspan said, however, that wringing inflation out of the
economy over the next five years would have short-tem costs in
terms of slower growth.
   The Hamilton-Dorgan proposal also calls for the Fed's budget,
which currently is not reviewed by either Congress or the
administration, to be subject to review and would require that the
Fed's books be audited each year by congressional auditors. It also
would make the chairman's term start one year after the start of a
presidential term.
   Greenspan said all those changes would compromise the political
independence of the Fed, which he said was essential to the central
bank's main role of fighting inflation.
   In arguing for his proposal, Hamilton said, ``The purpose of our
bill is to increase the accountability of the Federal Reserve to
the American people by making the workings of the Fed more open and
by establishing a formal channel of communications between
policymakers.''
   The Hamilton-Dorgan measure originally called for the secretary
of the Treasury to be added to the Fed's key policy-making body,
the Federal Open Market Committee.
   That panel, composed of members of the Federal Reserve Board and
presidents of the Fed's regional banks, meets secretly eight times
a year to set interest rate policies. Decisions aren't made public
for six weeks after a meeting, and even then only abbreviated
minutes of the closed-door sessions are made available.
   The revised Hamilton-Dorgan bill drops the effort to put the
Treasury secretary on the Fed's policy board and instead calls for
the Fed panel to meet twice each year with the Treasury secretary
and other top administration officials. It also calls for the
immediate release of the minutes of the meeting.
   Neal's measure does not include any penalties if the Fed fails
to meet the five-year deadline for eliminating inflation.
   Consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 4.4
percent through the first nine months of this year.
   Current law directs the Fed to ``promote effectively the goals
of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term
interest rates'' but says nothing about the trade-offs between
these sometimes-conflicting goals.
   ``The law as it is presently written is so broad that the Fed
can do anything and say that they are following the law,'' Neal
said in arguing for his proposal.
   Neal's original legislation was much more specific in calling on
the Fed to reduce by 1 percent a year until it had reached zero
inflation.
   His new version, revamped to meet Greenspan's objections, simply
calls for the elimination of inflation in five years and
paraphrases language Greenspan has used to say that ``inflation
will be deemed to be eliminated when the expected rate of change of
the general level of prices ceases to be a factor in individual and
business decisions making.''
   Even the revised bills are given little chance of passing
Congress, especially in light of objections from key members of the
Senate Banking Committee.

<HEAD>Soviets Announce Big Decrease in Ruble's Value For Travel</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with details of devaluation. ADDS byline.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Bank announced today that it was
dramatically devaluing the ruble for people and businesses needing
convertible currency to travel abroad.
   The new rate of 6.26 rubles to the dollar is a tacit admission
that the ruble is not worth anything near the existing official
rate of .6277 per dollar.
   It means that Soviet travelers, instead of receiving $1.59 per
ruble, will instead get about 16 cents.
   The announcement, reported by the official Tass news agency,
indicated the standard rate will remain in effect for most
transactions, such as for foreign firms doing business in the
Soviet Union and for most international trade with the West.
   ``The special rate will be used by banking institutions in the
U.S.S.R. when selling hard currencies ... to citizens traveling
abroad on personal matters and when purchasing such currencies,''
Tass said.
   ``It will also be used when selling hard currencies ... to
state, cooperative and other public and other enterprises for
business trips of their workers abroad.''
   One Western diplomatic analyst, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the announcement could mark ``an initial step
toward eventual convertibility of the ruble'' on international
currency exchanges. But the source called it too small a step to
have any obvious effect on the Soviet Union's foreign trade status.
   Because the ruble cannot be freely exchanged for dollars, yen,
marks and other hard currencies, it has virtually no value outside
the Soviet Union.
   Soviet citizens have long been allowed to exchange just 200
rubles for travel abroad. Tens of thousands of Soviets making trips
to the West thus trade rubles for dollars on the black market and
smuggle cash out of the country.
   A tremendous increase in the number of Soviets being permitted
to travel abroad under the more open climate created by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms has been blamed by Western observers
for a sharp decline in the black-market value of the ruble.
   A spokesman for the Council of Ministers, which approved the
measure, characterized the change as an attempt to attract more
foreign tourists, curb the black market and encourage Soviet
citizens with hard-currency bank accounts to exchange them for
rubles, thus increasing the state bank's hard-currency reserves.
   The announcement did not indicate foreign tourists would be
allowed to buy rubles at the new rate, so it was not clear how the
move could affect foreign tourism.
   The spokesman, Valery Ovcharenko of the Council of Ministers
press office, told The Associated Press the new rule would take
effect Nov. 1.
   The new rate, if accompanied by a lifting of the limit on
official exchanges, would give Soviet travelers a more attractive,
legal alternative than the black market for buying hard currency.
   The growing disparity between the official rate and black-market
rates tends to feed anxieties about the nation's tenuous economic
condition.
   Tass gave no explanation for the devaluation, and Igor
Kozlovsky, deputy chief of the joint currency economics department
of the Finance Ministry, refused to give more details on the
decision. He would say only that it had been approved by the
Council of Ministers.
   The Council of Foreign Ministers in December ordered up a plan
for partial convertibility of the ruble, beginning with a 50
percent devaluation on Jan. 1, 1990.
   Making the ruble convertible would destroy the Soviet pricing
system, under which industrial goods and raw materials are cheap
and consumer goods are expensive.

<TEXT>
   Cineplex Odeon Corp. Chairman Garth Drabinsky is
planning a bid worth $666.8 million to buy his company, the firm
said today.
   Drabinsky and his long-time partner, Myron Gottlieb, are trying
to arrange financing for a $14 per share cash offer, Cineplex said.
   Cineplex's biggest shareholder, Los Angeles-based entertainment
giant MCA Inc., has agreed to sell its stake _ worth $330 million
under the proposed bid _ if Drabinsky can arrange financing and
mail the offer by Nov. 22, Cineplex said in a statement.
   The other big shareholder, Claridge Inc. of Montreal led by
Charles Bronfman, has also agreed to tender its $94.7 million stake
under the same conditions, Cineplex said.
   Cineplex owns more than 1,800 screens in about 500 locations in
North America. Drabinsky founded the chain a decade ago.
   A special committee of the Cineplex board would continue to meet
with other interested bidders until the Drabinsky offer is firm,
company spokesman Brian Hemming said.
   Cineplex stock was down 37{ cents to $10.87{ a share in early
New York Stock Exchange trading today.
   Drabinsky's proposed bid is less than the nearly $15 a share he
originally offered to buy out the Claridge stake and gain control
of the company piecemeal several months ago.
   MCA had objected to that move and regulators quickly quashed the
bid, saying Drabinsky was required to make the same offer to all
shareholders.
   Under their agreement with Drabinsky, MCA and Claridge retain
the right to pull out of any deal with him and tender their shares
to a higher competing bid, Cineplex said.
   The Cineplex statement also said MCA and Claridge have agreed to
buy the Universal City 18-screen complex in Los Angeles and lease
the facility back to Cineplex if the Drabinsky bid goes through.
   Cineplex also said it would sell its 51 percent stake in Film
House to joint-owner Rank Organization PLC of Britain.

<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Companies Inc. on Wednesday
announced it has adopted a poison pill defense against unfriendly
takeover attempts.
   Philip Morris said it was not aware of any takeover attempt, but
said the plan would guard against ``abusive tactics to gain control
of the company without paying all shareholders a premium value.''
   Philip Morris is the world's largest tobacco company. It also
owns Kraft, General Foods and Miller Brewing Co., making it the
world's largest consumer products concern.
   Shareholders will receive one common share purchase right for
each share they own. Under certain conditions the right entitles
them to buy shares of an acquiring company or of Philip Morris
itself at a discount.
   The board of directors of Philip Morris, if it approves of a
takeover offer, can anull the rights at any time by redeeming them
at 1 cent apiece.
   ``The rights will not prevent a takeover, but should encourage
anyone seeking to acquire the company to negotiate with the board
prior to attempting a takeover,'' Hamish Maxwell, board chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement.
   Critics of poison pills and other defensive measures say they
insulate management and can prevent takeovers that would be good
for shareholders.

<HEAD>Detroit's Convertible King, a Transplanted Michigander from Bavaria</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a 22-year-old exchange student, Heinz Prechter
decided to stay in the United States to pursue an auto sunroof
business.
   His decision grew into the ASC Inc. car conversion empire, and
at age 47, Prechter is spending weeks at a time at a new ASC
facility, back in his native West Germany.
   The man who left boyhood in rural Bavaria to chase the American
dream now has a foothold for expansion in the European Economic
Community of 1992 and beyond.
   ``We are a company with truly worldwide activities. For a small
company like ours, that's unusual,'' he said.
   Prechter, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1972, has
built a reputation in Detroit economic development circles and a
role in Republican politics that includes advising the president on
international competitiveness.
   He said he realized early that stability for ASC would depend on
international marketing, in Japan and in Europe. A recession in
Detroit earlier this decade punctuated the lesson.
   Between jet trips to West Germany, Prechter recently led a
visitor through a chrome-decorated studio at ASC's Southgate
headquarters.
   Getting his hands on the cars still makes him smile, and he
showed how the convertible top drops into concealment on a gold
special-edition Ford Mustang.
   Also gleaming under the lights were Audi, Porsche, Acura, Toyota
convertibles made by ASC, and a bright yellow soft-top Jeep.
   Raised in rural postwar West Germany, ``I grew up as a farm boy
and of course there were no cars,'' Prechter said.
   He left home at 13 to work as an apprentice in his uncle's auto
coach-building shop in Nuremburg, attending high school at night.
He went on to engineering school, and traveled to the United States
in 1963 to attend San Francisco State University as an exchange
student in engineering.
   In 1965, he quit school but decided to stay in the United
States. He moved to Los Angeles and opened American Sunroof Co.
with $750 worth of tools in a two-car garage rented from custom car
designer George Barris.
   Prechter began selling hand-cut, hand-formed metal sunroofs, new
to the United States at the time. A visiting Ford Motor Co.
executive asked him to do prototype work for Ford, and Prechter
soon moved his business to Michigan.
   ASC Inc. now has about 30 facilities and employs about 3,000
people crafting special editions, convertibles and prototypes for
the Big Three U.S. carmakers and overseas makers including Toyota,
Porsche and Saab.
   The newest plant, in Heilbrun, West Germany, does the
convertible conversion of the Porsche 944 Cabriolet. Prechter also
owns an interest in Karosserie Werke in Weinsberg, which does
advanced bodywork for makers such as BMW, Porsche, Ford,
Volkswagen, Opel and Fiat.
   In the industrial area south of Detroit, Prechter is dubbed the
``Duke of Downriver'' because of his holdings.
   He owns Heritage Network Inc., including a chain of 16 suburban
newspapers; the Heritage Development Corp. real estate company; the
Presidential Inn near the ASC complex in Southgate; and the
Portside Inn restaurant in Wyandotte. He owns a 5 percent interest
in Security Bancorp Inc. He doesn't reveal figures on his privately
held enterprises.
   Prechter said he allocates one-fourth of his time for community
and political affairs. He is chairman of the Downriver Metroplex
Alliance, a business and community leaders' group.
   He is active in Detroit economic development groups as well. He
was one of about a dozen investors who saved Detroit's London Chop
House from closing by purchasing the culinary landmark in January.
   Prechter is a busy Republican fund-raiser. He was active in
fund-raising events that brought in nearly a million dollars for
President Bush's campaign.
   ``It's now day one after the election and I'm dead tired,''
begins a handwritten note of thanks from Bush that Prechter keeps
on his desk.
   ``He was very active in raising money for the president and for
the state party, in 1988 in particular,'' Michigan Republican Party
Chairman Spencer Abraham said. ``He's clearly somebody who has a
real, honest, philosophical commitment to the political process.''
   His opinion appears to matter, though he has no interest in
seeking office himself. The Prechters attended a White House state
dinner for the visiting prime minister of Australia, and Prechter
was seated next to Secretary of State James Baker III.
   ``My vision always was to make a difference in what I do,'' he
said. ``I first and foremost want to be a businessman.''
   That means pursuing international ties he began establishing in
1971, when few courted Asian business.
   Now he tries to unravel European import restrictions and other
red tape, to prepare for the planned integration of the European
Economic Community in 1992, when trade barriers theoretically will
be abolished.
   European business leaders rely more heavily than Americans on
business and social contacts within a rigid old boy network,
Prechter said. ``We are not used to the strict conformist
orientation of society there.
   ``America is such a flexible place, and such an easy place. That
is one of the reasons we are not an export-oriented country.''

<TEXT>
   Sara Lee Corp. reported record first-quarter
earnings Wednesday, a 24.1 percent increase over the year-ago
period.
   Earnings for the three months ending Sept. 30, the company's
first fiscal quarter, rose to $93.8 million from $75.6 million for
the same period last year, the Sara Lee said in a statement.
   Earnings per share increased 15.4 percent to 75 cents, compared
with 65 cents a year ago. The lower percentage increase in earnings
per share is due to a higher level of preferred dividends and more
common shares outstanding in the current quarter, the Chicago-based
company said.
   Quarterly sales totaled $2.7 billion, down 0.1 percent from last
year's level, due to the disposition of Sara Lee's food service
business at the beginning of their 1990 first quarter.
   ``Earnings growth remained strong during the quarter,'' said
John E. Bryan, chairman and chief executive officer. ``In spite of
restructuring our foodservice business which resulted in an annual
loss of more than $1 billion in sales, our core operations reported
solid results, with outstanding performance in our personal
products businesses.''
   Sara Lee makes and sells packaged food and consumer products
such as printed T-shirts and hosiery.

<UNK>Norfolk Southern Reports Third Quarter Earnings Down 16.1 Percent</UNK>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norfolk Southern Corp. reported Wednesday
that third-quarter earnings declined 16.1 percent because of a
decrease in non-coal revenues and rising expenses.
   Earnings for the third quarter was $150.5 million or 87 cents a
share, the railroad and transportation company said. Earnings for
the third quarter of 1988 totaled $179.4 million or $1 a share.
   Arnold B. McKinnon, the company's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the decline in merchandise revenues
reflected a flattening of the economy.
   ``There were some bright spots,'' he said. ``Strong exports and
utility markets produced a 2.4 percent growth in coal revenues,
while increased production at the new auto plants on our lines
accounted for a 2.4 percent increase in automobile revenues.''
   Earnings for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $458 million
or $2.61 a share, up 0.4 percent from the first nine months of 1988
when earnings totaled $456.1 million or $2.51 a share.
   Transportation operating revenue was down 1.8 percent to $1.14
billion for the third quarter of 1989 when compared to the third
quarter of 1988. Of that amount, railway revenues declined 1.8
percent to $903.3 million and motor carrier revenues dipped 1.7
percent to $238.8 million.
   Total transportation operating expenses increased 5.4 percent in
the third quarter, to $941.4 million, and 7.9 percent for the first
nine months, to just under $2.8 billion.
   For the nine months, total transportation operating revenues
were $3.43 billion, up 3.8 percent from $3.30 billion a year
earlier. Railway operating revenues rose 3.9 percent and motor
carrier revenues rose 3.2 percent.
   Nine-month transportation operating expenses rose 7.2 percent,
with railway expenses up 7.9 percent and motor carrier expenses up
4.9 percent.

<HEAD>Big Drop At Bethlehem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said Wednesday that
weakening steel markets helped cut its third-quarter earnings by
more than half to $46.9 million, or 53 cents per share.
   In the 1988 third quarter, Bethlehem earned $101.4 million, or
$1.18 per share.
   Sales fell 7.9 percent from $1.32 billion to $1.22 billion in
the comparable three-month periods.
   ``We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a
further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive
sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories,''
said Walter F. Williams, chairman of the nation's second-largest
steelmaker.
   The company's steel-related segment operated at a loss of $8
million during the quarter and $128 million loss for the first nine
months. Operating losses were $80 million and $97 million
respectively in the 1988 periods.
   Nine-month profits fell nearly 42 percent from $337 million, or
$4.17 per share, to $196 million, or $2.28 per share. Sales slid
slightly from $4.16 billion to $4.10 billion.

   The stock market edged upward today in an
atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's volatile session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.38 to 2,666.60 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 754 up, 661 down and

   The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic
growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but
also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits.

gain, climbing 3] to 118\. The company reported higher
third-quarter earnings, raised its dividend and disclosed plans for

   The U.S. dollar firmed against most foreign
currencies in European trading Wednesday. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said trading was directionless in the absence of any
fresh market-moving news.
   ``The market has been quiet, the dollar seems to show a tendency
to rise a little bit,'' said a trader at a large U.S. bank in
Frankfurt.
   Traders said they are awaiting Thursday's U.S. third quarter

<HEAD>Sears to Produce TV Show Featuring Ex-Host of `This Old House'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. announced plans Wednesday
to finance a television show featuring home repair expert Bob Vila,
who was forced to leave a similar program in a conflict of interest
dispute.
   The new television show, tentatively named ``Home Again with Bob
Vila,'' will be co-sponsored by Sears and syndicated nationally,
said Kathy Gucfa, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based retailer.
   Ms. Gucfa said she believes it's the first time the retail giant
has sponsored and syndicated a television show.
   Vila, longtime host of the Emmy Award-winning Public
Broadcasting Service show ``This Old House,'' also has been signed
as the exclusive spokesman for all Sears home improvements
products, the retailer said in a news release.
   The new weekly half-hour show will feature do-it-yourself
remodeling jobs the average consumer can afford. It's scheduled to
begin airing in the spring of 1990.
   Vila was host of ``This Old House'' from its national debut in
1979 until early last spring, when his annual contract was not
renewed.
   Vila had been doing commercials for a competitor of a major
local underwriter of the show, which is produced by WGBH-TV in
Boston, said Daphne Noyes, publicist for ``This Old House.''
   ``He had agreed to give up some of his commercial activities, if
we could indemnify him for the loss of income,'' she said by
telephone Monday. The station chose not to do so and decided not to
renew his contract, she said.
   Vila has appeared in advertising as a spokesman for a number of
commercial enterprises, including Time-Life home repair books;
American Electric Power, a heat pump maker; Amerock Corp., a
cabinet and storage hardware maker; and Boyle-Midway Household
Products, Inc., makers of Easy Off oven cleaner.
   ``The vast majority of his prior endorsements have been
terminated,'' said Vila's agent, Ron Feiner, but he declined to say
whether that was a provision of his deal with Sears.
   Vila will continue to appear in Time-Life ads, Feiner said.
   The new show is not designed to be a competitor with ``This Old
House,'' said Feiner.
   ``It's going to be a show that's absolutely going to stand on
its own,'' he said.
   Vila's production company, B.V.T.V., will create 39 original
programs for the new show, with 13 reruns making up the balance of
a full-year schedule, Sears said.
   Commercial time for the half-hour segments will be divided
between Sears and non-competing advertisers, the retailer said.
   Feiner said the bitterness Vila felt after being forced to leave
PBS has disappeared.
   ``He's looking to the future now,'' Feiner said.

<TEXT>
   Calling it toxic waste dumping and the
second Opium War, anti-smoking crusaders in Asia have accused
American tobacco interests of moving to reverse victories scored
against the cigarette by targeting the booming Pacific Rim as a key
market.
   The American companies, faced with anti-smoking regulations that
depress profits in the United States, say the budding anti-smoking
movement in Asia is an excuse for trade protectionism.
   American cigarettes entered the once closed markets of South
Korea, Japan and Taiwan in 1986 and now tobacco companies are
trying to penetrate Thailand. American cigarettes historically have
been hot sellers in Hong Kong.
   Asian smoking opponents claim the American hard sell and slick
ads equating smoking with the good life will create a new
generation of smoking addicts, especially women and teen-agers.
   ``Smoking foreign cigarettes has become a symbol of money and
social status,'' the China Pictorial Magazine stated recently,
noting the price of a couple of cartons of Marlboros equal a
Chinese professor's monthly salary.
   In Taiwan, an anti-smoking group called John Tung's Foundation
claims smoking has soared among teen-agers because of hard-sell
tactics by American tobacco companies. Eight-five percent of
youthful puffers prefer imports, the Tung group says.
   In a letter to President Bush earlier this year, health groups
from nine Asian countries described the American push as ``a
mockery of your country's efforts to curb the export of other
addictive drugs into your country.''
   Activists have likened the American blitz to last century's
Opium War when Britain forcefully flooded China with opium from its
colony India and made addicts out of millions.
   Those favoring increased exports, such as Congressman Robin
Tallon of South Carolina, a major tobacco-growing state, contend
Asians will continue to buy cigarettes with or without American
presence.
   ``The real issue is whether American companies will be allowed
to compete, or if the playing field is abandoned to other foreign
manufacturers and local monopolies,'' he said.
   The U.S. Cigarette Export Association notes as part of its
argument that cigarettes contributed a record $3.5 billion to help
reduce the U.S. trade deficit in 1988.
   The U.S. Trade Office is threatening Thailand with trade
penalties if it does not lower its import tax and other barriers to
American cigarettes. It is seeking the reversal of laws under which
cigarette advertising was sharply restricted in 1979 and virtually
eliminated from mass media this year.
   Thai anti-smoking lobbyists, some of whom recently testified in
Washington, say their stand against American cigarettes is not a
smokescreen for protectionism.
   ``My bottom line is anti-smoking. I don't care if it's Thai or
American cigarettes,'' said Dr. Prakit Vatee-Satokit of the Thai
Anti-Smoking Campaign Project. ``I see people die of smoking every
day.''
   Prakit said he is concerned that a full-scale American entry
will target youth and women. In a smoking profile typical of many
Asian nations, only 3.5 percent of Thai women were said to smoke in
1988 vs. 46.6 percent of males.
   Led by 250 million Chinese, Asians remain among the world's most
prolific puffers and account for 44 percent of global cigarette
production. Governments take in hefty revenues from state
monopolies and cigarette import taxes and thus are reluctant to
take too tough a stand against their domestic industries.
   But private pressure groups and governments in some Asian
countries, inspired partly by the American anti-smoking movement,
have made some notable gains in the tobacco war.
   Led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a doctor turned
politician, Malaysia banned smoking in government offices in 1982
and all hospitals this year. Cigarette advertisements on television
and radio, both government controlled, have been replaced by
messages about smoking's harmful effects.
   But the Asian-Pacific Conference on Cigarette Smoking and
Health, which sent the letter to Bush, said American cigarette
promoters in Malaysia still place television ads for such things as
``Kent Travel Bags'' and ``Tours of Marlboro Country'' in which
viewers are asked to call a local travel agency if they wish to
visit ``Marlboro Country.''
   Prakit says the number of Thai smokers has fallen sharply since
1976, partly because of an increased awareness of the health risks.
The country beat the United States in forbidding smoking on all
domestic airline flights, a regulation that took effect this year.
   Anti-smoking campaigners got to Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan who gave up his trademark cigars recently. He's joked
that his sex life has since improved.
   Other Asian leaders have set examples. Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew
abhors smoking in his presence and Philippines President Corazon
Aquino has banned it at Cabinet meetings.
   Those who light up on Singapore's buses, trains and taxis face
fines of up to $250. But in the Philippines the macho Marlboro Man
still rides tall as television audiences are bombarded with this
and other American cigarette ads long banned in the United States.
   Hong Kong, where American smokes dominate 70 percent of market,
cigarette advertising is banned on prime time TV and will be banned
from all programming by 1990. Controversy continues in the British
colony and elsewhere in Asia over tobacco industry sponsorships of
sports and cultural programs.
   Anti-smoking has made little headway in Japan and China and only
some in South Korea, where critics say American cigarettes are the
most heavily advertised products in the country although the market
share of imported cigarettes is still only about 4 percent.
   In China, where relatively expensive American cigarettes have
captured only a miniscule percentage of the market, the government
has not even imposed health warnings on packs. Top leader Deng
Xiaoping is a prolific smoker and is often photographed puffing on
a domestic `Panda'' brand.
   One flicker of interest was Beijing's participation in the first
World Anti-Smoking Day last April. Stalls in the city sold
``anti-smoking ointments,'' ``quit smoking mouth gargles'' and
battery powered electrodes attached to the cheeks and activated
each time the user gets an urge to smoke.
   In Japan, where more than 60 percent of the people smoke, among
the few places where smokers cannot indulge are underground
platforms of Tokyo's subway system. The sides of cigarette packs
carry the faintly printed admonition: ``Be careful not to smoke too
much for your health.''
   Japan remains one of the few industrialized nations to allow
cigarette advertising on TV, where popular foreign actors such as
James Coburn and Roger Moore promote smoking's glamorous image.
   The American incursion does not appear to have significantly
affected smoking in Japan. But the Asian-Pacific conference claimed
that since the market was opened to Americans in 1987, cigarette
ads on Tokyo television rose from No. 40 to second place in total
air time.
   Japanese companies, the conference reported, have responded to
stepped-up competition by copying Western-style advertising and
concocting new products. These include a women-oriented brand,
``Misty,'' and another called ``Dean,'' named after deceased
American actor James Dean, an idol among Japanese youth.

   The aim was admirable: Scratch extraneous
words from a tongue-twisting trade code.
   But by deleting three, a government agency has mistakenly opened
the nation's borders to cheap brooms _ and U.S. makers of a witch's
favorite ride fear their sturdy, corn-bristle sweepers may never
stroke another dirty floor.
   ``It's thrown our industry into turmoil,'' says Tim Monahan of
Arcola, Ill., president of Thomas Monahan Co., the world's largest
supplier of corn-broom materials. ``We've seen them gearing up
heavily in Mexico.''
   ``It's absolutely unbelievable,'' adds Bill Libman, who runs an
Illinois corn-broom company founded by his grandfather in 1896.
   The industry, which includes approximately 50 major producers
making at least 20 million corn brooms a year, from whisk to floor
models, says it's been dusted by the U.S. International Trade
Commission.
   In an effort to simplify language, the commission changed the
section that put import restrictions and costly tariffs on brooms
made ``wholly or partly of broom corn.''
   The rules now apply only to brooms made ``of broom corn.''
   The change got little attention until the Customs Service was
recently asked to interpret the new code. Is a broom that is 28
percent to 43 percent corn bristle subject to the government's
import limit?
   The Customs Service said no.
   And with that green light, foreign producers now can stuff their
brooms with cheap material such as grass or vegetable fibers, ship
them to the United States and market them as dependable corn brooms
_ even though they are not the real thing, Monahan said Wednesday.
   Libman said his company makes more than 1 million brooms a year
at prices ranging from $6 to $8.
   Foreign brooms ``are selling for less than half,'' he said.
``It's not a good product. It lasts for a month and you throw it
out. The consumer doesn't know the difference.''
   ``We're just a small industry,'' Monahan said. ``We can't afford
to educate the public.''
   A Washington attorney who represents Mexican broom exporters
said the American makers ``just don't want competition.''
   ``It's just hysteria,'' attorney Leslie A. Glick said,
dismissing claims that his clients make inferior brooms. ``My
clients call them natural-fiber brooms. The Mexican industry isn't
that big.''
   A trade commission official acknowledged the mistake in a Oct.
13 letter to the Customs Service, which enforces tariff policy.
   ``There was no intention on the commission's part to change the
tariff treatment of whisk brooms and other brooms containing broom
corn,'' David B. Beck wrote.
   ``The consequences this would have on the tariff treatment of
these products were never brought to our attention ... when we
could have done something about it,'' he said.
   ``So we understand that your hands are somewhat tied in
interpreting the essential character of these products,'' Beck
wrote.
   Some angry members of Congress are pledging to rescue U.S.
corn-broom makers.
   Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., whose district includes Arcola,
introduced a bill Tuesday to correct the error. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, the chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee,
is pushing similar legislation.
   Ironically, the corn-broom rule and other code changes were
approved by Congress.

   Du Pont Co. reported Wednesday that it's
third-quarter profit jumped 19 percent over a year ago despite a
stronger dollar and weaker housing market.
   The chemical giant said that net income for the three months
ended Sept. 30 totaled $547 million, or $2.36 a share, compared
with earnings of $461 millin, or $1.91 a share, the same time last
year.
   Sales rose 9 percent to $8.6 billion from $7.9 billion.
   ``We are pleased with third quarter results, which were achieved
despite a stronger dollar and a weaker housing market,'' Du Pont
Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. said in a statement.
   ``Most businesses in our portfolio continue to out perform
prior-year levels ... We expect 1989 to be our fourth consecutive
year of increased earnings.''
   For the first nine months of this year, Du Pont's profit rose 18
percent to $1.9 billion, or $8.46 a share, from $1.6 billion, or
$7.03 a share, in 1988.
   Sales were up 10 percent to $26.5 billion from $24.1 billion.

   GM Hughes Electronics Corp., builder of the
Galileo Jupiter probe released last week, said Wednesday that
employment cuts and lagging General Motors Corp. auto production
cut its third-quarter earnings 18 percent.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp., the automaker's finance and
mortgage arm, said an interest pinch cut its July-September
earnings 3 percent from the third quarter of 1988.
   Electronic Data Systems Corp. said new data processing contracts
with savings and loan associations helped boost its earnings by 12
percent.
   GM's major subsidiaries reported their earnings Wednesday. GM is
scheduled to report consolidated earnings Thursday, as are Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   GM Hughes Electronics reported net income of $147.8 million, or
37 cents per share of GM Class H stock _ the issue dependent on its
performance _ down from $179.6 million, or 45 cents a share, in the
third quarter of 1988. Revenue for the quarter was $2.58 billion,
down from $2.63 billion a year earlier, the company said.
   The company said an 8.4 percent decline in domestic GM vehicle
production cut use of its Delco electronics products. It reported
$24 million in retirement, severance and other costs for the
quarter in connection with an 8 percent employment cut announced in
June at Hughes Aircraft.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company said it had
net income of $598.2 million, or $1.48 a share, on revenue of $8.47
billion, compared with $632.6 million, or $1.58 a share, on revenue
of $8.19 billion in the 1988 period.
   GM Hughes Electronics had 1988 revenue of $11.2 billion.
   GMAC, the largest unit with 1988 revenue of $13.5 billion, said
net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 dropped to $234.5
million from $241.9 million in the third quarter of 1988. GMAC
doesn't report earnings per share; it doesn't have a separate stock
issue dependent on its performance.
   GMAC said it financed or leased 676,000 new cars and trucks in
the United States in the quarter, up 35 percent from a year
earlier, but borrowing costs averaged 9.38 percent, up from 8.45
percent.
   Net income for the first nine months was $859.5 million, down
from $930.2 million in the first nine months of 1988, GMAC said.
   EDS reported quarterly net income of $110.9 million, or 93 cents
per share of GM Class E stock, up from $95.9 million, or 79 cents a
share a year earlier. Revenue was $1.37 billion, up from $1.22
billion a year earlier, the company said.
   For the first nine months, EDS reported net income of $315.8
million, or $2.62 a share, on revenue of $4.03 billion, up from
$280.7 million, or $2.30 a share, on revenue of $3.54 billion in
the first nine months of 1988.
   EDS had 1988 revenue of $4.84 billion.

   Oil Minister Golamreza Aqazadeh predicted
Wednesday that world oil demand would grow so strongly in the next
two years that OPEC would abandon its current system of production
limits.
   In a news conference with foreign reporters, Aqazadeh also said
Iran would seek compensation for the destruction of offshore oil
platforms by U.S. forces near the end of the Gulf war.
   Aqazadeh did not give any specific growth rate predictions for
world oil demand, but contended it would ``increase substantially''
over the next two years.
   ``We anticipate this demand will reach such a level that the
OPEC quota system will be abandoned altogether,'' Aqazadeh said.
   ``As a result all members will be able to produce as much as
necessary to meet demand, and the OPEC quota system will be
abandoned.''
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries now attempts
to support a price of $18 a barrel for its crude oil through a
system of voluntary production limits, or quotas, imposed on each
of its 13 members.
   Prices have hovered somewhat below that level, partly because
overproduction by some member nations has pushed OPEC's output
above the official ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day.
   Asked how prices would be set once the quota system was
abolished, Aqazadeh said ``there will be a long-term production and
price strategy and by controlling production OPEC will be able to
control price.''
   ``Some very serious discussion over long-term strategy is taking
place among OPEC members,'' Aqazadeh said. He gave no details on
how long-term production would be controlled without quotas.
   William Veno, director of oil market analysis for Data Resources
Inc. in Boston, said demand in non-communist nations grew by 2.3
percent _ about 1.2 million barrels a day _ in the first three
quarters of 1989 for total daily consumption of 51.2 million
barrels.
   OPEC's average production during that time was 21 million
barrels a day, he said.
   Data Resources projects that worldwide demand growth will slow
to 1.3 percent in 1990 and about 1.2 percent annually in the next
three years.
   Aqazadeh also said Iran intends to seek compensation from the
United States for destroying Iranian offshore oil platforms during
the Gulf war.
   He did not say how much the compensation should be, but said
total damage to his country's offshore oil installations during the
eight-year war was $1.5 billion. Most of the damage resulted from
Iraqi air raids.
   U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf attacked a number of Iranian
oil platforms, which Iranian forces used as bases for attacks on
neutral shipping.
   Aqazadeh said Iran's main oil loading platform on Kharg Island,
which was raided repeatedly by Iranian jets, sustained $300 million
worth of damage.
   He said Iran planned to invest $8.4 billion in hard currency on
petrochemical expansion projects over the next five years. If
spending in local currency is included, total investment in such
projects could reach two to three times that amount, he said.
   Aqazadeh said Iran now earns $12 billion annually from oil and
expects to earn $70 billion over the next five years. The current
earnings were based on a daily production of about 3 million
barrels per day, some 2 million barrels of which are exported.
   Aqazadeh said current production capacity was 3.5 million
barrels a day, but it was not fully used, to conform to Iran's
production quota of 2.92 million barrels a day set by OPEC.
   He said expansion and reconstruction would increase capacity to
4 million barrels a day within three years, compared with pre-war
capacity of 6 million barrels.
   Aqazadeh said Iran's current total refining capacity is 730,000
barrels per day.

   A burly bearded man uses sign language to
communicate with his pal as they belly up to the bar in a beer
advertisement.
   An ad for laundry detergent shows a man in a wheelchair
sky-hooking a soap packet into the washing machine. An ad for a
Southern bank shows a mother getting her children off to school and
settling down to ``read'' her bank statement, written in braille.
   Advertisers have been making greater use of people with
disabilities in mainstream commercials, designed to show the wide
appeal of their products and services.
   Advocates for the more than 37 million ``physically challenged''
Americans have welcomed this increased visibility. But they say the
disabled still are under-represented.
   ``Advertisers have been a bit timid,'' said Arney Rosenblat,
spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and an
advocate of more disabled people in advertising. ``They always try
to get sexy girls and project a mainstream idea of what everyone
wants to look like using their product.''
   But she said a growing awareness of the economic clout of the
disabled and pressure on Congress to forbid discrimination against
the disabled are having an impact.
   She said the disabled have an estimated $40 billion a year in
spending power, an appealing target for manufacturers who have
shown keener interest in getting messages to narrowly defined
audiences.
   ``Five years ago, you couldn't name one company (using disabled
people in commercials) but now there are 10 or more,'' Ms.
Rosenblat said.
   They include Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc., Colgate-Palmolive
Co., Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., Ralston Purina Co., Apple Computer
Inc., Citicorp, Nike Inc. and General Motors Corp.
   Athletes in wheelchairs have been popular, including a Nike
commercial that featured racer Craig Blanchette.
   But advocates for the disabled say they are even more encouraged
by ads that integrate average people with disabilities into
real-life vignettes.
   Ralston, for instance, showed a blind man and his guide dog in a
recent commercial for Purina Dog Chow; Citicorp cast a businessman
in a wheelchair with a briefcase on his lap in an ad that showed
people hurrying to work; and a Dayton Department Stores ad included
a boy in a wheelchair among a half-dozen youngsters trimming a
Christmas tree.
   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the apparel maker from San Francisco, was
among the first to integrate disabled people into general
advertising.
   In 1984, Levi used a man in a wheelchair as one of several
people shown in a commercial for Levi's 501 blues, and has used a
woman in a wheelchair, a hearing-impaired woman using sign language
and an amputee on crutches.
   ``We have never used them deliberately except when it seemed
appropriate for the situation,'' said Alan Jewett, an executive at
the Levi ad agency, Foote Cone &amp; Belding.
   Fast-food leader McDonald's Corp. has made prominent use of the
disabled.
   Its captioned ``Silent Persuasion'' ad a few years ago showed
two deaf students using sign language on a study break. Another ad
called ``Best Friends'' showed a typical day for two junior high
girls, one in a wheelchair.
   ``Our view is that since a large percentage of our commercials
deal with `slice of life' situations, you don't ignore people who
are a large part of society,'' said Chuck Ebeling, spokesman for
the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company.
   In an ad for Budweiser that ended an 18-month run late last
year, Anheuser-Busch showed a dozen scenes of friends enjoying a
beer _ a group of graduates in their gowns, some aging veterans at
a reunion, a father and son on a porch.
   In one shot of a crowded bar, a bearded man can be seen using
sign language as he talks with a pal standing beside him.
   ``Great catch!'' the admakers said the deaf man tells his friend
as they watch television. ``Want another Bud?''
   Colgate-Palmolive admakers cast a man in a wheelchair for a Fab
One Shot commercial that ran last year. The commercial showed
people tossing the detergent packet into the washing machine from
odd angles to the tune ``Sweet Georgia Brown.''
   Ariel Allen, vice president of creative services at Colgate,
said she previously had received letters encouraging her to use the
disabled in ads, and felt it would be appropriate for this
commercial.
   The man selected for the ad played in a basketball league for
the disabled, she said, and he provided ``something extra that
happens from both a human and a selling point of view.''
   Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Winston-Salem, N.C., has been
running ads for months that draw attention to its services. The
bank has been printing bank statements in braille for blind
customers since the 1970s but had not advertised it until earlier
this year.
   The commercial shows a woman at her door as her children leave
for school. She turns back into the house and takes some papers off
a table. But it is only when she is seated and scanning the papers
that viewers see they include a statement written in braille which
the woman reads by passing her fingers over the raised dots. She is
blind.
   Advocates for the disabled say they want to see more. Disabled
people make up 15 percent of the population but far fewer in ads.
   Laura Slutsky, founder of Peoplefinders Inc., a New York-based
agency that specializes in finding non-professional talent for
commercials, said none of the 50 or so advertisers she works for
have asked for disabled people, although she expects that to change.
   Jerry Saviola, director of casting services at Grey Advertising
in New York, said advertising agency people may simply not be
``sensitive enough to the whole situation'' to request disabled
people for roles.
   Sometimes even when a disabled person is required for in a
commercial, admakers can stumble.
   Bill Demby, the Vietnam vet who lost both legs in the war and
starred in a commercial that showed him playing basketball with
artificial legs made by DuPont Co., said he almost backed out of
the commercial.
   He said one person involved in making the ad indicated he would
manipulate a camera to make it appear Demby could jump much higher
than he actually could.
   In a telephone interview from his home near Washington, Demby
said the comment upset him because he didn't want to mislead
anybody about what artificial legs could do for an amputee.
   ``But they assured me they would try to keep a reign on'' the
offending admaker, Demby said, and he made the ad.
   He said he's happy with the result and thinks it reflects well
on both the disabled and veterans. ``The only difference between
disabled people and others are what we use as transportation,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Surge; Wheat Sags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of corn and soybeans shot higher,
but wheat prices sagged at the close of trading Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   This week's light trading continued for a third day, with little
outside news of any consequence affecting prices, said Susan
Leighty, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Lack of export demand and beneficial rains for both the South
American and U.S. winter crop was hurting wheat prices, Ms. Leighty
said.
   Supporting futures prices was new Soviet interest in the
agricultural markets, as the Soviet Union purchased 50,000 metric
tons of Argentine meal and 350,000 metric tons of corn from
Yugoslavia since Tuesday, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 5} cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.03} a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2{ cents higher, with December at $2.42{ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1\ cents lower, with December at $1.45} a bushel;
and soybeans were 2{ cents to 5} cents higher, with November at

   The stock market was mixed today in an
atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's volatile session.
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in
early trading Tuesday, and then rebounded to recoup most of its
loss.
   Analysts said that typified the recent volatile behavior that
has put many investors on their guard.
   In addition, traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in
advance of the government's report Thursday morning on the gross
national product for the third quarter of the year.
   The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic
growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but
also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits.

   The United States on Wednesday confronted 16 allies
pressing to ease controls on sensitive high technology sales to
Communist governments in light of rapid changes in the Soviet bloc.
   A U.S. source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged
before the meeting that Washington was all but isolated by allies
who want greater trade with fewer restrictions.
   At the same time, the source said, the U.S. delegation feels
that some countries, including West Germany and Italy, have not
strengthened export controls as promised.
   The meeting of COCOM, the Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls, was expected to end Thursday. Until
then, not even its location was to be disclosed.
   COCOM, comprised of the 15 NATO nations and Japan and Australia,
regulates trade in items to Soviet bloc nations.
   The U.S. Embassy said three issues would dominate the agenda:
streamlining the list of restricted items, improving export
controls and discussing political developments in the East.
   COCOM's list of restricted items threatens to drive a wedge
between the United States and its European allies.
   U.S. officials contend that, in a new atmosphere of openness,
Soviet engineers are acquiring restricted Western technology at
what may be an unprecedented rate.
   European governments insist the Bush administration is dragging
its feet, reviewing the list item-by-item and retaining simple
items that reached Moscow long ago.
   They argue that changing philosophies in Eastern Europe put
political and economic pressure on them to expand trade.
   Increasingly, COCOM partners accuse the United States of using
the list to stifle foreign competitors of American manufacturers.
They say that some U.S. companies are also guilty of infractions.
   Recent U.S. intelligence findings report that more than 5,000
machine tools have been sold illegally to the Soviet Union over the
past five years. The Kremlin depends on Western high-precision gear
for manufacturing military equipment.
   Before the meeting Wednesday, Reginald Bartholomew, U.S.
undersecretary of state for security assistance, visited Rome to
warn that Olivetti might be banned from selling some items in the
United States.
   The Italian manufacturer was alleged to have exported to the
Soviet Union machine tools used for making fighter aircraft
engines. Olivetti also was reported to have sent technicians to the
Soviet Union.
   In a well-publicized case last year, Japan's Toshiba Machine Co.
was accused of selling sophisticated equipment to the Soviet Union
in violation of COCOM regulations.
   The United States claimed the equipment helped the Soviets build
quieter, harder to detect submarines, and it slapped severe
sanctions on Toshiba Machine and prohibited it from exporting to
the United States for three years.
   On Wednesday, another Japanese firm, Tomei Shoji, was convicted
of exporting electronic products to communist North Korea in
violation of COCOM rules. The trading firm and one if its employees
were fined a total of $4,900. Two other employees were given
six-month prison terms.
   Specialists say part of the problem is the political role of
export industries in national economies.
   Earlier this year, Defense Department officials showed The
Associated Press an internal report identifying West Germany as
``the greatest single source of transfers of sensitive technology''
to the East.
   The report blamed pressure from German business on a government
eager for links to East Germany and the Soviet Union.
   Even France, regarded as a relatively effective COCOM partner,
has allowed serious leaks.
   Earlier this year, French officials said they were investigating
the apparent role of a government adviser in illegal sales to
Moscow of machine tools used in making warplanes.

<HEAD>U.S. Oil Companies Continue Reshuffling As Domestic Reserves Dwindle</HEAD>

   Mobil Corp.'s plan to trim its U.S. exploration
and production business reflects an industry-wide trend toward
bolstering their shrinking reserves by boosting overseas
exploration, analysts said Wednesday.
   Mobil's announcement on Tuesday followed similar restructurings
earlier this year by other major oil companies, including Texaco
Inc., Amoco Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company after Exxon
Corp., said in its third-quarter earnings report that it had taken
a $40 million provision for the restructuring costs.
   The oil giant said it planned to transfer and terminate
employees over a two-year period ``to reduce costs and focus
efforts in areas where the projected financial returns are most
attractive.''
   Details of the reorganization were not immediately available,
but Mobil spokesman John Lord said an announcement was planned for
Friday.
   ``Mobil has been selling off a great number of small properties
since the early 1980s,'' Lord said. ``This (restructuring) is part
of that.''
   Analysts familiar with Mobil's strategy said the announcement
was not a surprise given the general industry trend to cut U.S.
drilling costs and focus exploration overseas, where the
probability of finding large reserves is greater and financial
exposure is lower due partly to more favorable tax and royalty
rates.
   ``We're going to see more and more announcements by other
majors,'' said Paul Ting, analyst with the investment firm
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Low crude oil prices over the last few years and heavy
exploration costs in the United States have discouraged many
companies from pumping more money into domestic oil drilling.
   Crude prices have hovered in the $18 to $20 a barrel range in
recent months, and as low as the $12 range last year.
   More importantly, analysts say, the U.S. oil patch may be nearly
bone dry, with little oil left outside of the Gulf of Mexico,
Alaska and offshore California. The last major U.S. oil find was in
the late 1960s in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.
   Industrywide, domestic production fell by more than 500,000
barrels a day during the first nine months of this year compared
with a decline of about 200,000 barrels a day during 1988.
   ``Basically, the U.S. has been drilled over for oil. The large
deposits are in geologically hostile areas or off limits due to
environmental concerns,'' said Philip J. Kehl, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Most oil companies, including large independents, are
reshuffling assets abroad because of declining U.S. output, Kehl
said.
   ``Areas outside the U.S. are considered a more cost-effective
use of oil drilling funds,'' he said.
   In 1986 Mobil announced a major restructuring of its upstream
operations _ exploration and production _ as part of an
industry-wide shakeout due to plummeting oil prices.
   Last March, Texaco announced the reorganization of its U.S.
upstream operations into two regions as part of an overall
restructuring to increase the company's profits worldwide. The move
included the streamlining of regional and divisional offices and
trimming of management.
   Amoco followed with an announcement in late March that it was
cutting its U.S. exploration and production workforce by 800. Amoco
said at the time that its domestic operations would continue to
shrink through divestment of marginal and non-strategic properties
while international activities would grow.
   Occidental continued the trend in recent weeks with the
announcement that it had ceased all U.S. exploration and was
expanding its drilling overseas.

<HEAD>Takeover Era Irony: Deal That Inspired the Biggest Fear is Doing

<TEXT>
   Wall Street was stunned. Bond brokers froze.
Doomsayers talked of financial disaster.
   That was the scene a year ago, as the biggest takeover battle of
all time consumed RJR Nabisco Inc. When it was over, the investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. had defeated the food and
tobacco giant's top management, paid a record $24.53 billion in
borrowed money and put the company heavily into debt.
   Critics of the 1980s takeover era said RJR Nabisco would be
crushed by the weight of its debt load and jeopardize the banks
that financed the deal. The bond market, already reeling from a
rash of high-priced takeovers, was traumatized because investors
thought the buyout binge had gone too far.
   What a difference a year makes.
   Despite a debt of $23 billion, RJR Nabisco now is seen as a
relative rock of stability while the financial markets are buffeted
with uncertainty raised by smaller takeovers.
   ``I think the company is doing tremendously well,'' said Kurt
Feuerman, a securities analayst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Jack Maxwell of Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va., said,
``It's a good company and they've got a good team.''
   Investors also praise the new RJR Nabisco. Confidence in the
company was evident in the recent performance of the company's
high-yield ``junk bonds'' that were used to finance the takeover.
Prices skidded on the high-yieother big buyouts ran
into trouble recently. RJR Nabisco's didn't.
   There are two reasons why.
   Because of the nature of RJR Nabisco's business, the company is
considered inherently more stable than other companies. Investors
also have confidence in its management.
   The biggest worry for highly leveragedld market after  companies like
RJR
Nabisco is cash flow _ without a strong, steady influx of money,
they can't pay their interest bills.
   Several buyouts have stumbled because cash flow hasn't matched
projections. The most notorious case has been Campeau Corp.'s $6.6
billion takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc., a wobbly
transaction that jolted the stock and bond markets a few weeks ago
because Campeau couldn't pay its interest.
   Kohlberg Kravis, the acknowledged leader plan to shed any major divisions,
Gerstner
said in an interview.
   Individual product lines are the most likely to go. Gerstner
said the Butterfingers and Baby Ruth candy bar business is under
consideration, but he declined to name any other possible
candidates.
   Maxwell, the Wheat First analyst, said he was pleased by cost
and inventory reductions and by the company's plans for boosting
tobacco sales. In recent years, R.J. Reynolds has turned around its
once-lagging Camel brand, and is focusing on revitalizing Winston
and Salem sales, Maxwell said.
   The battle for RJR Nabisco marked a quantum leap in the scope of
the takeover trend reshaping American business. For the first time,
it seemed to raise the possibility that any company could be
acquired with borrowed money.
   The company announced on Oct. 20 that its chief executive, F.
Ross Johnson, was considering a bid of about $17 billion.
   That kind of money was beyond comprehension on Wall Street. But
four days later, Kohlberg Kravis announced a $20.25 billion offer,
signaling the start of a bidding war that for a while included the
investment firm First Boston Corp.
   The RJR Nabisco fight not only dwarfed all records for
takeovers, it came against a background of brawls for two other big
food companies.
   Just days before, Philip Morris had launched an $11 billion
offer for Kraft Inc. and Pillsbury Co. had rejected a $5.23 billion
bid from the British firm Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   In both cases the suitors won. And late in the evening of Nov.
29, RJR Nabisco announced that Kohlberg Kravis had emerged the
winner.
   Johnson was vanquished but still rich from a severance package
and the sale of his own RJR Nabisco stock when he resigned in early
February. He took several top RJR Nabisco managers with him, but
analysts said they were satisfied with Gerstner's replacements.
   Kohlberg Kravis is also said to be happy with RJR Nabisco's
performance. The investment firm is smarting from Seaman's problems
and reports that it has been disappointed by other investments, and
its reputation rests on the outcome of its biggest takeover.
   For Gerstner, the outside world's obsession with the size of the
takeover is irrelevant. It's running the business that's most
important.
   ``You've got to separate that financial transaction from the
great marketing strength and production strength of this company,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. said Wednesday
its third-quarter profit rose 5.2 percent from a year ago on a
revenue increase of 6.1 percent, but warned that price cutting
could slow future earnings growth.
   The company, which is the world's largest brewer and also makes
snack foods, said earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $238
million, or 83 cents per share, up from $226 million, or 78 cents
per share, last year.
   Sales in the quarter rose to $2.70 billion from $2.55 billion in
1988.
   The company said it sold a record 21.4 million barrels of beer
in the quarter, up 4.2 percent from a year ago.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company said its beer
sales accounted for 41.9 percent of the industry's sales, up from
40.6 percent as year earlier.
   But August A. Busch III, chairman and president, said
Anheuser-Busch is being challenged by competitors who have begun to
heavily discount their premium brands.
   ``We have been very reluctant to discount our high quality
premium brands to the same extent as our competitors,'' Busch said.
But he said some discounting is required to avoid further losses in
sales volume.
   Busch said the financial impact of the price cuts will be lower
earnings growth than anticipated for the last half of 1989 and the
year 1990. But he said the move should eventually pay off in an
even stronger market position and in higher earnings.
   For the first nine months, the company earned $639 million, or
$2.23 per share, up 8.2 percent from $590.4 million, or $2.01 per
share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales of $7.3 billion in the first three quarters of
last year.
   The company recently agreed to purchase four Sea World Parks,
two other theme parks and certain land near the parks from Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc. for $1.1 billion. The deal is expected to be
closed in November, Anheuser-Busch said.

   The stock market drifted through a mixed session
Wednesday in an atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's dramatic
swings.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.94 to 2,653.28.
   But advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
784 up, 700 down and 474 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.65 million
shares, down from 237.96 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 184.54 million shares.
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in
early trading Tuesday, and then rebounded to recoup most of its
loss, finishing down 3.69 points.
   Analysts said that typified the recent volatile behavior that
has put many investors on their guard.
   In addition, traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in
advance of the government's report Thursday morning on the gross
national product for the third quarter of the year.
   The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic
growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but
also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits.
   The brokerage firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. estimates
that third-quarter GNP will show an increase at an annual rate of
1.5 percent to 2 percent, after adjustment for inflation, down from
2.5 percent in the April-June quarter.
   DuPont turned in one of the best performances among the Dow
Jones industrials, climbing 2{ to 117]. The company reported higher
third-quarter earnings, raised its dividend and disclosed plans for
a 3-for-1 stock split.
   Among other blue chips, Philip Morris dropped 1 to 43{;
McDonald's lost 1\ to 31{, and International Business Machines fell
1[ to 101~, while American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up ] at 43{.
   UAL fell 9 to 161. The stock has gyrated wildly in recent
sessions after plans for a buyout by a labor-management group ran
into trouble.
   Computer Associates International led the active list, down } at
12~. On Tuesday the company reported lower earnings for the quarter
ended Sept. 30.
   Comprehensive Care tumbled 4} to 3|. The company posted a loss
for its fiscal quarter ended Aug. 31 and said it was negotiating an
extension of its bank debt.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.27 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .53 to 189.52.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.91 to 390.92, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.20 at 342.50.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.19 to 462.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 375.92, down .44.

   The dollar ended mostly lower Wednesday against
major foreign currencies in thin, narrow trading following a mixed
performance overseas.
   Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369.10 a troy ounce,
down $1.10 from Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a late bid for gold at $368.50 an ounce, off 20 cents.
   Currency dealers said the dollar got an early lift from comments
from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan but edged lower mainly
on technical factors. They said many dealers were awaiting
Thursday's release of third-quarter gross national product data,
which should shed more light on the direction of the economy and
interest rates.
   In testimony before Congress, Greenspan hinted that the central
bank was unlikely to ease credit by lowering interest rates any
time soon because the current inflation rate of 4.4 percent was too
high to be ignored.
   Firm rates are seen as bullish for the dollar partly because
they make dollar-denominated securities more attractive to
foreigners, thereby increasing the need for those investors to
convert their money into the U.S. currency.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to 141.55 Japanese yen from 142.10 yen
Tuesday. It traded at 141.60 yen in London, and at 141.57 yen in
New York, up from 141.50 Tuesday.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound. In London, the
pound rose to $1.6090 from $1.6065 late Tuesday. Later, in New
York, sterling fetched $1.6143, up from $1.6075.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
quotes, included: 1.8350 West German marks, down from 1.8358;
1.6075 Swiss francs, down from 1.6095; 6.2270 French francs, down
from 6.2370; 1.17545 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17135; and
1,345.00 Italian lire, down from 1345.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, vs. Tuesday: 1.8410 West German
marks, up from 1.8390; 1.6129 Swiss francs, up from 1.6120; 6.2520
French francs, up from 6.2475; 2.0740 Dutch guilders, down from
2.0860; 1.1745 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1723; and 1,350.00
Italian lire, up from 1,349.00.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368.25 an ounce, up
from $367.75 bid Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $368.70 an
ounce, up from $367.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.72 to settle at $386.63 an
ounce.
   Silver prices lost ground. On New York's Comex silver bullion
for current delivery dropped to $5.114 a troy ounce from $5.148.
Silver fell in London to $5.11 an ounce from $5.12.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a drizzly morning when traffic was snarled by
an overturned nail truck, Seattle residents on Wednesday learned
their fast-growing home had been named the nation's best place to
live for the second time this year.
   The 1989 edition of the Places Rated Almanac picked Seattle tops
among 333 cities in terms of climate, transit, crime, education,
health care, environment, jobs, arts and recreation.
   While Seattle struggles with explosive growth, schools that
don't seem to live up to expectations and the pervasive problems of
drugs and crime, attorney Margaret Pageler sees a special brand of
optimism in the city.
   ``What I love about Seattle is the optimism of Seattle people
about our future,'' she said. ``There's that sort of progressive
spirit of optimism. Perhaps it's what's left of the Western can-do
spirit that's still here.''
   Others who take a less spiritual view might cite Mount Rainier's
glacial peak, the ferries plying Puget Sound, fresh salmon and
Dungeness crabs stacked in the public market or ski slopes amid
forests of Douglas fir.
   Runner-up on the almanac's list was San Francisco, followed by
Pittsburgh, Washington and its Maryland-Virginia suburbs, San
Diego, Boston, New York, Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., Louisville,
Ky., and New York's Long Island.
   The lowest ranking went to Pine Bluff, Ark., where Chamber of
Commerce President Jim Berry tried to put a better spin on the
ratings.
   ``You could look at it as being the 333rd strongest city in the
country,'' Berry said. ``There are at least 4,000 to 5,000 other
cities in the United States.''
   Joining Pine Bluff at the bottom of the list were, counting from
332nd up: Odessa, Texas; Laredo, Texas; Yuba City, Calif.; St.
Joseph, Mo.; Victoria, Texas; Greeley, Colo.; Gadsden, Ala.;
Casper, Wyo.; Albany, Ga.; and Naples, Fla.
   Earlier this year, Money magazine also rated Seattle the
nation's most livable city.
   The announcement caused some Seattle movers and shakers to note
that while the city is a wonderful place to live its urban woes _
principally growth _ are mounting. Publicizing the city may only
make problems worse, they say.
   ``Seattle does have a lot of elements people seem to be paying
attention to,'' said Dennis Ryan, chairman of the Department of
Urban Design and Planning at the University of Washington.
   ``It may be lacking elements people are not paying attention to
_ the ability of a city to deal with hard social problems.''
   In the survey, Seattle was rated tops in the nation for
recreation, which comes as no surprise to the hundreds of thousands
of residents who ski, hike, climb mountains, fish, hunt, sail,
kayak or bicycle within minutes or, at most, a couple of hours of
their homes.
   The city is home to the University of Washington and the
nationally renowned Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It has
more than half a dozen professional theaters staging plays. The
local economy is diversifying, tourism and trade are up and the
jobless rate was a relatively low 4.1 percent as of August.
   The Cascade Mountains to the east and the Olympics to the west
across the Puget Sound provide beautiful sunrises and sunsets, when
the sun finds its way through the normally gray skies.
   Growth and popularity haven't changed Seattle's legendary damp
climate, but longtime residents worry about what it's doing to a
town they knew for its close neighborhoods and relaxed pace.
   Crime has grown, with an influx of drug-dealing gangs and the
stigma of the nation's worst known serial murder case, the string
of at least 41 slayings of young women attributed to the Green
River Killer.
   Seattle's schools have seen declining test scores, a flight of
students to suburban and private schools, and an agonizing debate
over revamping school busing for desegregation.
   A commute that used to take 20 minutes from the suburbs now
takes an hour or more. Smog hovers over Elliott Bay and collects in
the valleys south of the city, on some days veiling all but a
yellowed outline of Mount Rainier.
   On Wednesday, however, the semi-truck that dumped the nails on
Interstate 5 north of the city was cleared before the commute was
over, and the clammy weather gave way to crisp blues skies by noon.

<HEAD>IBM Opens Advanced Chip Laboratory; Will Add X-Ray Etching</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. dedicated
a $500 million computer chip laboratory Wednesday and said it would
share its research on X-ray etching with another U.S. chipmaker,
Motorola Corp.
   IBM spokesman Paul Bergevin said the Advanced Semiconductor
Technology Center in East Fishkill, N.Y., was ``the nation's most
advanced semiconductor development laboratory and on a par with any
anywhere in the world.''
   The upstate New York laboratory will eventually house the
nation's first privately owned machine for etching computer chips
with X-rays, IBM said.
   IBM scientists are already experimenting with X-ray etching at
Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y. Motorola will pay an
undisclosed amount of money to send its engineers to Brookhaven to
participate in the IBM research for 21 months.
   The X-ray work at Brookhaven will be transferred to the new
laboratory in East Fishkill in 1991, at which time the investment
in the laboratory will total about $500 million, Bergevin said.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher attended Wednesday's
dedication ceremonies, along with Robert Noyce of Sematech and
Sanford Kane of U.S. Memories Inc. The two organizations are
intended to bolster America's standing in computer chips.
   Bergevin said IBM was discussing sharing its X-ray etching
research with other U.S. companies out of an interest in
strengthening the overall U.S. semiconductor industry.
   Scientists say future generations of computer chips will be so
densely packed with circuitry that regular light will be too fuzzy
to etch the circuit lines. X-rays have shorter wavelengths, so they
can draw finer lines.
   Japanese companies are working intensively in X-ray etching.
Bergevin said ``we're certainly on a par with the very best
efforts'' of the Japanese.
   The East Fishkill laboratory will consolidate semiconductor
research now done at chipmaking plants in East Fishkill and Essex
Junction, Vt., and at IBM research headquarters in Yorktown
Heights, N.Y.

<HEAD>Discounter Aims at Strong Retailing Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Ames Department Stores Inc. decided to
bring Zayre stores into the corporate fold, there were doubts that
the discounter had selected an acquisition that would fit in easily
or enhance its operations.
   A year later, Ames is putting the finishing touches on what it
calls the single largest U.S. retail conversion ever. On Thursday,
254 former Zayre stores will open their doors under the Ames name.
   The 12-month process has turned Ames into a dominant discounter
in the Northeast and the fourth-biggest discount retailer in the
country with expected sales this year of $5 billion. The three
leading discounters are K mart Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the
Target Stores division of Dayton Hudson Corp.
   Peter B. Hollis, Ames president and chief executive officer,
said integrating Zayres has demonstrated Ames' ability to handle
change, a necessary skill for mass merchants to have in a business
where prosperity depends on being able to adapt to shifting
consumer tastes and shopping habits.
   ``Retailers who fail to change will fall by the wayside,''
Hollis said in an interview.
   Ames had considerable experience with acquisitions before it
bought Zayre Corp.'s discount store division in October 1988 for
$778 million. About 500 of Ames' 693 stores in 20 states and
Washington were the products of acquisitions; Ames has doubled its
size twice in the past 4 years.
   ``We are a company that are accustomed to acquisition. And we
are accustomed to change,'' said Hollis.
   Retail analysts say Zayre posed a tough challenge for Ames.
   At the time Ames came on the scene, Zayre stores in some areas
were suffering from a reputation for shoddy merchandise and poor
service. Under Zayre Corp., which has restructured the retail
operations it retained and changed its name to TJX Cos. Inc.,Zayre
stores weren't making money.
   Also, Zayre was technologically behind Ames, lacking the
advanced cash registers and other hardware needed to accomodate
computerized inventory controls.
   Industry analysts say the use of sophisticated inventory
management techniques _ employing state-of-the-art technology _
might be even more important for discounters than for regular
retailers. Discounters must carefully monitor costs to maintain
their slimmer profit margins.
   Ames went in and refurbished Zayre stores to give them a more
customer-friendly layout and a better merchandise mix. Staff had
the concept of customer service drilled into them.
   Technology was upgraded. Ames made a $30 million investment in
cash registers and back-office equipment to speed customer
check-out, streamline store data collection and provide the
foundation for further improvements, such as bar-code scanning.
   Hollis said the use of scanning had to be postponed within Ames
for a year while the Zayre stores were being made compatible. It is
being tested now and should be in place next year.
   As in Ames' original stores, the former Zayre stores are
carrying more national brands in apparel, for instance.
   ``We have completely remerchandised everything carried in Zayres
stores,'' said Hollis.
   Retail analysts generally give Ames high marks for its long-term
strategy but have taken a wait-and-see attitude about the near
future.
   Ames lost $20.7 million, or 72 cents a share, in the first half
of this year due to the costs of transforming Zayre and
disappointing retail sales. Hollis has said the full year will turn
out to be profitable.
   Retail analyst Elizabeth Armstrong of Prescott Ball &amp; Turben
said the ``acquisition of Zayre will test their ability for some
time because it was a major acquisition.''
   But she said it could pay off.
   ``The combination with Zayre is going to give Ames quite a lot
of power,'' she said. ``The environment is competitive and will
continue to get more competitive but good management can do well.''
   Henry Jicha Jr., an analyst with Wood Gundy Corp., thinks Ames
can thrive under its current management.
   ``Ames prides itself on its management capability, I think
justly so, '' said Jicha.
   Ames' performance in the fourth quarter, by far the most
important time for retailers, will provide an indication if
customers like what Ames has done.
   ``The proof of the whole pudding is going to come in the fourth
quarter,'' said Jicha. He is recommending purchase of Ames stock
based on a projected return to profitability this year and a sharp
jump in earnings next year.
   In addition to the 254 renamed Zayre stores, Rocky Hill,
Conn.-based Ames owns 61 others that are retaining the Zayre name.
Ames said its research indicated that the markets in which the 61
operate _ mainly Miami, Chicago, Washington and Baltimore _ had
strong customer loyalty to the Zayre name.

<TEXT>
   Midway Airlines Chairman David R. Hinson is
behind the wheel of his company car _ a late-model domestic station
wagon _ snaking through a single lane of rain-soaked traffic slowed
by construction.
   The contractor widening the roads outside Midway Airport had
promised to keep two lanes open. Hinson picks up his car phone and
orders a secretary to complain.
   ``You've got to stay on top of these contractors all the time,''
he says.
   Hinson's conservative car and attention to detail reflect the
attitude that has made this scrappy regional carrier survive the
past decade, to become what the 56-year-old chairman and former
fighter pilot calls ``an airline airline.''
   Midway, the last U.S. airline certified in the era of regulation
and first new one to fly under deregulation, marks its 10th
anniversary Wednesday.
   Although it has less than 1 percent of the national air-travel
market, Midway's business is expanding quickly at a time when
rivals are worried about keeping passengers. In November, the
carrier is opening a second hub in Philadelphia and offering
first-class service.
   Midway also is unencumbered by the kind of takeover trauma
preoccupying its larger Chicago neighbor, United Airlines parent
UAL Corp.
   ``We realize that even though we're growing rapidly, we're
smaller than most of the carriers _ but we're an airline airline,''
Hinson said in an interview.
   An original investor in Midway, Hinson sees the airline as a
regional carrier providing many of the same services offered by
larger competitors: flights to many cities, a frequent-flier
program and international links.
   ``It's a nice little airline, no doubt about it,'' said John V.
Pincavage, a partner at The Transportation Group Ltd., a New
York-based investment bank that specializes in airline securities.
   Midway has achieved that status through attention to customer
service, a conservative balance sheet and avoiding direct
competition with large airlines, Hinson said.
   Department of Transportation figures on domestic airlines for
the first nine months of 1989 show Midway ranks among the top 10
for the fewest passenger complaints, at an average 1.46 per 100,000
passengers, and in honoring reservations, bumping an average 1.6
passengers per 10,000 boarded.
   Midway started as a cut-rate airline offering penny-a-mile fares
in its first promotion on Nov. 1, 1979, when three DC-9s flew to
Cleveland, Detroit and Kansas City.
   The carrier now serves 51 cites with a fleet of 64 planes from
Midway Airport, 11 miles southwest of Chicago's Loop. That is about
half the distance from downtown to O'Hare International Airport.
   Earlier this year, Midway signed a $2 billion deal with
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. for 74 new jets and agreed to pay $244
million for 33 twin-engine turbo-prop commuters from a West German
manufacturer.
   While its capacity has steadily increased, earnings have varied.
Two years of modest profits followed a first-year loss. Midway then
logged three losing years through 1985, when Hinson became chairman
and chief executive officer.
   The company since has since reported three consecutive
profitable years, although earnings fell last year. One explanation
for the slump was a drop in passenger traffic blamed on Midway's
slow response to triple-mileage frequent flier incentives offered
by other airlines.
   ``We made a mistake,'' Hinson said.
   Midway earned $6.5 million, or 60 cents a share, on revenues of
$412 million in 1988, vs. $18.6 million, or $1.70 a share, on
revenues of $346.9 million in 1987.
   The airline earned $8 million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of
$233 million for the first six months this year, vs. $4.3 million,
or 27 cents a share, on $192 million in revenues for the
year-earlier period.
   Analysts who follow airline stocks see Midway as a solid
performer in a volatile industry. But the airline's $205.6 million
acquisition of Eastern Airlines assets at Philadelphia
International Airport could hurt Midway's financial performance in
the next two years.
   Hinson is counting on the airline's lock on Midway Airport to
help pay the cost of developing the Philadelphia hub.
   ``We have this chasm to get across, but we can fund that out of
Chicago,'' he said. ``It would be a big mistake for us to go to
Philadelphia and try to be successful if we didn't have a pretty
good airline here in Chicago.''
   In an increasingly competitive industry, Julius Maldutis, an
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York, said Midway has a
strong future.
   ``They have a very important market niche in terms of the Midway
Airport dominance that they have successfully developed,'' he said.
   ``I think more importantly, they have one of the strongest
managements in the airline industry in terms of developing that
niche, because it basically boils down to management.''
   Midway's success has spawned persistent rumors of a takeover,
but no deal has surfaced. Midway management treats the 9.6 percent
stake purchased earlier this year by Ampco-Pittsburg Corp. as a
``normal business investment,'' said airline spokeswoman Sandra
Allen.
   But when its crosstown neighbor UAL was in the midst of takeover
negotiations in August, Midway's board strengthened the company's
``poison-pill'' defense against hostile suitors.
   ``I mean prudent boards do those things,'' Hinson said. ``But
the board's instructions to me and my feeling as well is that we're
going to operate Midway like any business.
   ``If somebody insists on buying the company and they offer a
price that's so high that the board feels they must accept it, then
we'll sell the company, obviously.''

<HEAD>Once Flamboyant, Ex-RJR Boss Now a Low-Key Executive</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-RJR Nabisco</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after starting and losing the fight over
RJR Nabisco Inc., F. Ross Johnson has all but disappeared from
public view. But he lacks neither money nor activity.
   In the aftermath of the $24.53 billion battle for the food and
tobacco giant, the Johnson era is a memory at RJR Nabisco.
Acquaintances and associates say it's also history to the man who a
year ago was president and chief executive of the company.
   RJR Nabisco, now owned by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., has moved its headquarters from suburban Atlanta to
midtown Manhattan and is headed by former American Express Co.
president Louis Gerstner.
   The once flamboyant Johnson, 57, meanwhile, is the low-key
chairman of RJM Group, an Atlanta-based international management
advisory company organized in February when Johnson resigned from
RJR Nabisco.
   He took a fair amount of money with him when he left. Johnson,
who earned a $1.8 million salary in his final year with RJR
Nabisco, received $7.2 million in continued pay to see him through
1991, when he will be eligible for retirement benefits.
   His ``golden parachute'' included nearly $2 million to help
Johnson pay his taxes. He also received $19.2 million worth of RJR
Nabisco stock.
   Johnson would have been even wealthier had his bid for the
company prevailed. He said during the height of the RJR Nabisco
fight that, if successful, he could expect to make $100 million in
seven or eight years.
   ``But making $100 million was not my motive by any stretch of
the imagination,'' he said then.
   Nonetheless, Johnson was seen as pursuing a buyout purely for
his own greed. He was criticized for his initial low $17 billion
bid and his own built-in rewards in the offer.
   His plans to sell off all of the company's non-tobacco
businesses and disregard of RJR Nabisco employees also rankled many
people _ including the firm's board of directors _ and although his
$25.2 billion final bid was higher than the Kohlberg Kravis offer,
it wasn't enough to win.
   The record size of the RJR Nabisco deal also brought
unprecedented public attention to the phenomenon of leveraged
buyouts, takeovers largely accomplished through the use of borrowed
funds.
   After Kohlberg Kravis' victory in early December, Johnson issued
a statement wishing the new owners good luck and maintaining that
his initiation of the takeover process benefited the company's
stockholders. He has offered no further public post-mortems.
   ``I think he's put that in the past,'' said William Liss, an
Atlanta consultant who was a senior vice president at RJR Nabisco
under Johnson.
   Liss said he understood that Johnson has discussed the takeover
battle with several authors in an effort to ensure that books about
the deal are accurate. Joel Koblentz, a partner at Egon Zehnder
International Inc., an Atlanta executive search firm that has dealt
with several former RJR Nabisco employees, said Johnson sits on
eight or nine corporate boards and also has been exploring various
investment opportunities.
   Johnson has stepped out of the public spotlight by his own
choice, Koblentz said.

<HEAD>LIN Says McCaw Will Have To Extend Partial Tender Offer for LIN Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp. said Wednesday that McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc. will have to extend its $2.75 billion
offer for about 40 percent of LIN's shares.
   The McCaw offer of $125 a share for 22 million of LIN's shares
is currently scheduled to expire Friday, but LIN said McCaw will
have to extend it because McCaw has failed to announced sufficient
committed financing for the deal.
   LIN said federal securities regulations would require McCaw to
keep its offer open five days after announcing fully committed
financing.
   McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone company that has
been pursuing LIN since June, said in a statement that it was
``moving forward with our financing beyond the initial round of
commitments.''
   The Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw said last week that it had
received $1.2 billion in financing commitments from three banks
that are highly confident they could arrange a syndicate of banks
to commit the balance of the $4.5 billion in financing needed
within a few weeks.
   McCaw wants to arrange financing for more than the costs of the
tender offer alone because it intends to buy Metromedia Co.'s
half-interest in a cellular franchise in New York City for $1.9
billion as well.
   ``The issue now at hand is will LIN conduct a fair auction,''
McCaw said in Wednesday's statement.
   New York-based LIN has taken no position on the McCaw offer, and
won't do so until it hears from BellSouth Corp., the regional
telephone company based in Atlanta with whom it has a separate deal
to merge cellular telephone operations.
   A spokeswoman for BellSouth said the company expects to respond
to the McCaw offer for LIN soon, but could not say when.
   In national over-the-counter trading Wednesday, LIN rose 50
cents a share to $109.25 while McCaw rose 50 cents a share to
$40.50.

<HEAD>Oil Futures End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices ended mixed Wednesday with
the crude oil market under pressure from growing concern about
excess OPEC production.
   Analysts said the crude market largely ignored an American
Petroleum Institute report that showed a decline in oil inventories
last week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude,
finished 10 cents lower at $19.62 a barrel. January crude ended
down 3 cents at $19.52 a barrel while contracts for later delivery
advanced.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also closed mixed. The
November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.61 cent to
53.40 cents a gallon and later contracts also rose.
   November heating oil lost 0.1 cent to 58.44 cents a gallon and
December declined 0.20 cent to 58.67 cents a gallon, while
contracts for later delivery showed gains and losses.
   Analysts said API statistics released after the close of trading
on Tuesday showed that inventories of crude and products declined
in the week ended Oct. 20. Although the data should have been
bullish, concern about rising oil production dampened the markets'
enthusiasm, traders said.
   ``The markets sagged as traders continued to express some
concern over higher OPEC production as well as evidence of sluggish
U.S. demand,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The API data showed that crude stocks fell 6.3 million barrels
to 336.5 million barrels; total gasoline supplies were down 2.1
million barrels to 223.2 million; and heating oil declined 374,000
barrels to about 120 million barrels.
   Industry estimates suggest that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is continuing to increase production. OPEC
output recently swelled to more than 22 million barrels a day, well
above its official quota of 20.5 million barrels a day.
   Various OPEC members also have suggested recently that the
cartel will raise production further as worldwide demand for OPEC
oil increases in coming years.
   Nevertheless, U.S. demand is expected to decline, putting
downward pressure on oil prices.

   The Chicago-based money manager on Wednesday cited what it

<HEAD>Machinists Union Swings Into High Gear in Boeing Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A production-halting strike against Boeing Co. is
only strengthening the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers, union president George Kourpias said Wednesday.
   Addressing reporters at the District Lodge 751 hall after two
days of visiting picket lines in Wichita, Kan., Portland, Ore., and
the Seattle area, Kourpias vowed the union would spare no effort or
expense to win.
   ``I am here to tell you personally that the international union
is totally committed to seeing this strike through to victory,''
Kourpias said.
   In a room containing 20 eight-foot tables loaded with bread,
canned goods and other food, plus a wall lined with food cartons
five to six high, all donated, he cited similar support for
striking Pittston Co. coal workers and Eastern Airlines employees.
   Carla Bowman, a striker and union volunteer worker, said food
donations amounted to $5,000 to $10,000 at the district lodge alone.
   ``I am certainly proud to be associated with the working people
here at Boeing who are leading the fight for fairness and justice
for working families here and throughout the land,'' Kourpias said.
   The union represents 57,800 Boeing workers nationwide, including
43,300 in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in Portland,
and a few hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Utah,
Montana, Wyoming and other states.
   Union members voted 85 percent to strike rather than accept a
three-year contract.
   The contract offers pay increases of 4 percent the first year, 3
percent the second and 3 percent the third; bonuses of 8 percent of
gross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second;
cost-of-living increases to cover inflation; a 20 percent reduction
in mandatory overtime; and higher benefits.
   Since the strike began Oct. 4, Boeing has announced orders for
68 aircraft worth $4.3 billion and has delivered 11 planes, all of
which were virtually complete before the walkout.
   The only talks during the strike collapsed after less than four
hours Oct. 18, and no more meetings have been scheduled.
   Major issues are wages, mandatory overtime, pensions, health and
welfare payments and standards for promotions.
   Distribution of strike pay of $100 a week per striker begins
Thursday. The last paychecks for work done before the strike were
issued last week.
   Neither Kourpias nor district lodge president Tom Baker would
predict how long the strike could last.
   Kourpias said fewer than 1 percent of union-covered workers were
crossing picket lines.
   With a strike fund of $95 million and 850,000 members paying
into the fund weekly, strike pay of $100 a week could be maintained
``as long as it takes,'' he said.

   Soviet workers at six mines called strikes
Wednesday in Arctic Circle coalfields that were hit by large-scale
walkouts last summer, the region's strike leader said.
   About 5,000 miners had voted for walkouts by Wednesday evening
and up to 20,000 at 12 mines were expected to strike, said Valentin
Kopasov, chairman of the Vorkuta area strike committee.
   The strike violated a law passed this month by the Soviet
legislature setting arbitration procedures for would-be strikers
and banning walkouts in such vital areas as energy, defense and
transportation.
   First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin said this month that power
stations and public utilities had 4.5 million fewer tons of coal on
hand than at the same time last year due to the summer strikes.
   He said miners would have to work harder to avoid rationing of
heat, light and electricity this winter.
   This summer, strikes in virtually all the Soviet Union's major
coalfields, from Central Asia in the south to the Vorkuta fields in
the far north, paralyzed much of its coal industry. The miners, who
demanded better working conditions and consumer supplies as well as
more financial independence for their mines, went back to work
after the government conceded to almost all their demands.
   But this week, miners in Vorkuta and in the western Siberian
mining town of Mezhdurechensk declared the government had failed to
come through on some of the promised benefits.
   About 20,000 Mezhdurechensk miners staged a two-hour warning
strike Monday despite officials' protests that they were showing
disrespect for the new law.
   The Vorkuta strikers demanded the government fulfill its
promises of this summer and punish officials who had gone back on
their word. They also wanted official status to be granted to new
committees formed to defend workers' interests, Kopasov said.
   As he spoke Wednesday by telephone from Vorkuta, word arrived at
strike headquarters that the town's chief prosecutor had ordered
officials at one of the striking mines to give him a list of the
walkout's organizers, Kopasov said.
   He said that made the strike leaders expect a crackdown from
local authorities.
   At a news conference Tuesday, the head of the Interior Ministry
troops that have been sent in to quell major unrest around the
Soviet Union in recent months said his soldiers would not be called
on to repress any renewed strikes.
   ``That is a political-legal question. We handle only massive
disorders,'' said Col.-Gen. Yuri Shatalin.
   This summer's coal strikes involved virtually no violence.
Strikers policed their own ranks and the authorities generally
refrained from intervening.
   But that was before the new law on strikes, when the strikers'
legal status was unclear. The government has not indicated what its
response to such open defiance of the new law will be.
   There has been no report of reprisals against the Mezhdurechensk
workers who struck Monday.
   Kopasov said the Vorkuta strikers also were demanding
publication of an appeal to the country's workers that called for
solidarity and condemned the new strike law.
   The law ``is aimed at depriving workers of the right to the
extreme measure of striking, and at distancing the worker from the
process of democratization,'' it said in part.
   The strikers also put forth several political demands, including
that the country's legislature consider doing away with the article
in the constitution that makes the Communist Party the ``leading
and guiding force of Soviet society,'' Kopasov added.

<HEAD>Class-Action Suit Filed Against Retail Empire</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A class action lawsuit was filed Wednesday on
behalf of a group of Campeau Corp. shareholders alleging officials
of the struggling real estate and retailing giant misled them about
its ability to repay a huge debt.
   The lawsuit was brought in U.S. District Court against the
Toronto-based Campeau, chairman Robert Campeau and other top
executives.
   Campeau owns a range of department stores in the United States
and is perhaps best known for its purchase of Bloomingdale's, the
swank East Coast retailing chain.
   The company's $11.5 billion debt has injected uncertainty into
the corporate bond market and raised the likelihood that
Bloomingdale's and other valuable Campeau assets will have to be
sold.
   The lawsuit seeks to determine whether the price of Campeau's
common stock was artificially inflated by alleged
misrepresentations about the company's financial situation. A
damage amount isn't specified.
   ``Although Campeau Corp. incurred significant debt in connection
with its massive acquisitions throughout 1988 and until
mid-September 1989, it made positive statements regarding its
financial condition and it repeatedly reassured the investing
public that it would be able to repay its debt,'' the suit said.
   ``The motivation for this deceit was that Campeau needed
additional financial capital from private and public sources,'' it
said.
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of all people who purchased
Campeau stock between April 1 and Sept. 19, when the company
disclosed it reached an agreement with one of its major
stockholders, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., on a $250 million
loan to help the company meet interest payments due on its bonds
and help its stores pay for winter and spring merchandise.
   The lawsuit said news of the company's financial restructuring
sent the price of Campeau stock tumbling and caused substantial
losses to shareholders.
   The loan from Olympia &amp; York was be used to provide cash for
Campeau's two retail units, Allied Stores Corp. and Federated
Department Stores Inc.
   Besides Bloomingdale's, Campeau's U.S. retail operations include
the Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Ralphs, Lazarus, Burdines and
Rich's-Goldsmith's chains.
   Campeau said last month that Bloomingdale's probably would have
to be sold as part of a restructuring to reduce the company's debt
exposure.
   A Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday that Tokyu Department
Stores Ltd., a large Tokyo-based retailing chain, had offered $1.3
billion to buy Bloomingdale's. Campeau declined to comment on the
report in the daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun.

   Grand pianos and haute cuisine.
Mahogany and gold. A Florida company is bringing European-style
luxury trains to the U.S. rails _ for a price.
   Refurbished Pullman cars will carry passengers coddled by an
on-board staff between Chicago and Washington, D.C., beginning Nov.
15. The cars will be pulled behind Amtrak's regularly scheduled
train over the route.
   A preview excursion between Panama City and Atlanta is set to
leave Friday with about 55 passengers for a one-time trip.
   American-European Express Railway Co. patterned the luxury
service after the storied Orient Express and its modern-day
recreation. Edy Zuger, chief executive officer of Nostalgie
Istanbul Orient Express of Zurich, Switzerland, which operates
luxury trains in Europe and Asia, is a partner in the $15 million
venture.
   Ten refurbished Pullman cars dating to the 1930s have been given
leather and mahagony interiors trimmed with brass and 24 karat
gold. Two club cars feature grand pianos. Dining cars will serve
seven-course meals on fine china.
   Passengers will have access to a fax machine and telephone along
the Chicago-Washington route that was picked in part for its
scenery, said Bill Spann, president of the Florida company. No
single seats will be available _ only sleeping compartments.
   ``Businessmen holding meetings, newlyweds, people having
affairs'' are some of the intended passengers, Spann said.
   The luxury cars will be hitched to regular Amtrak trains.
One-way fares for the cabins along the Chicago-Washington route
will range from $695 for a single to $1,450 for the biggest cabin,
called the ``Presidential.''
   Amtrak charges $103 to $356 one way between Chicago and
Washington, depending on whether the passenger is traveling in
coach or a sleeping car. Travelers on the Panama City-Atlanta
preview will pay $425 a person.
   It cost the company $1 million each to refurbish the Pullman
cars. All but one are completed.
   Spann, also president of Bay Point Yacht and Country Club in
Panama City Beach, said the service is the result of a chance
encounter he had with Zuger three years ago.
   Zuger had been looking for an American partner to set up a
luxury train operation in the United States. While vacationing at
Bay Point, he mentioned his plan to Spann, who said he would be
interested.
   Spann said he lined up investors to go into partnership with
Zuger's company, obtained the cars and made a deal to pay Amtrak up
to $5.6 million a year to pull them behind its regular Capitol
Limited.

<HEAD>Delta's Profit Up 33 Percent in Quarter; America West Up 30 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines on Wednesday reported a 33 percent increase in
quarterly net income to a record $133.1 million, attributing the
jump in part to the continuing strike against rival Eastern
Airlines.
   America West Corp., meanwhile, said its earnings increased
nearly 30 percent in the third quarter compared with the same
period in fiscal 1988.
   Atlanta-based Delta, the nation's fourth-largest airline, said
its earnings per share were $2.53 for the quarter ending Sept. 30,
compared with net income of $100 million, or $2.03 a share, a year
earlier. The period is the first quarter of the airline's fiscal
year.
   First-quarter revenue rose to $2.2 billion from $1.8 billion in
the same quarter of 1988.
   Net income for the nine months ending Sept. 30 was $408.9
million, or $8.11 a share, up 58 percent from the same period in
1988. Nine-month revenue rose 19 percent to $6.52 billion from
$5.47 billion.
   Delta's senior vice president, Thomas J. Roeck, said revenue
passenger miles for the quarter were up 14 percent over the same
quarter last year.
   He credited the increase to a more effective hub system and ``a
reduced level of service by a major competitor,'' an apparent
reference to Miami-based Eastern, where unions representing pilots,
mechanics and flight attendants have been on strike since March 4.
   Atlanta was Eastern's busiest hub before the strike.
   America West, an aggressive regional airline based in Phoenix,
Ariz., reported profit of $5.7 million, or 28 cents a share, in the
third quarter, up from $4 million, or 24 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue for America West increased to $243.4
million from $201 million.

<HEAD>Thrift Known for Junk Bond Investments Takes Huge Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association
said Wednesday it lost $226.3 million in the third quarter because
it was forced by new laws to record $357.5 million in losses
related to its huge junk bond holdings.
   Columbia, the biggest junk bond investor among the nation's
thrifts, earned $16.3 million in the same period last year. For the
three months ended Sept. 30, losses amounted to $11.57 per share,
compared with earnings of 37 cents per share in the same quarter in
1988.
   Under the leadership of Chairman Thomas Spiegel, a close friend
of junk bond wizard Michael Milken, Columbia for years angered
federal thrift regulators by amassing a huge portfolio of the
high-yield, high-risk securities.
   Unlike some thrifts, however, Columbia in 1986 and 1987 made big
profits on the investments, which now constitute about 30 percent
of its $12.7 billion in total assets.
   On Wednesday, the thrift reported an accounting loss of $130.2
million resulting from the savings and loan bailout bill signed in
August by President Bush, which requires thrifts to get rid of all
their junk bond investments by 1994.
   Columbia said it also added $227.3 million to its reserves for
losses on its junk-bond portfolio, bringing those reserves to $300
million, or about 6.7 percent of its total investment in the
securities.
   The market for high-yield, high-risk securities has weakened
severely in recent months, and the accounting loss of $130.2
million could be revised for the better if it improves, the company
said.
   In the future, thrifts will have to invest in such bonds through
separately capitalized affiliates rather than using
government-insured deposits.
   Spiegel said that as Columbia refocuses on its lending business,
``we remain one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the
industry.''
   Under the bailout bill, S&amp;Ls were required to have tangible
capital _ the excess of real assets over liabilities _ immediately
and reach 3 percent tangible capital by the end of 1994.
   Columbia had tangible capital of 6 percent before Wednesday's
writeoffs. After taking them it has 3.6 percent, spokeswoman Lenore
Hatch said.

   Zenith said its consumer electronics operations, which also
posted losses, were affected by a variety of factors.
   The company said it reduced distributor inventory levels of
color television sets, which undercut sales. It said it also shared
in the industrywide softness in the sales of video cassette
recorders.
   The quarterly loss of $24.1 million, or 90 cents a share,
compares with a $3 million profit, or 11 cents a share, during the
same quarter a year ago. Higher prices per unit helped sales
increase to $376.8 million from $360.7 million.
   Zenith announced earlier this month it is selling its computer
business to Groupe Bull of France, subject to stockholder approval.
It said the third-quarter loss from this operation was $15 million,
compared with a profit of $1 million during the 1988 period.
   Its quarterly loss from continuing operations _ its remaining
operations minus the computer business _ was $9.1 million, or 34
cents a share.
   For the first nine months, Zenith reported a net loss of $41.1
million, or $1.54 a share, compared with a $8.7 million loss, or 34
cents a share, during the year-ago nine-month period. Sales
improved to $1.11 billion from $961.2 million.
   ``Full-year 1989 consumer electronics operating profits are
expected to be better than last year's, but not as much as the $15
million improvement we forecast earlier,'' said Jerry K. Pearlman,
chairman and president.

<HEAD>SCI Television Proposes Exchange Offer for Bondholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SCI Television Inc., a privately held TV station
company struggling to meet payments on its $1.3 billion debt, said
Wednesday it was proposing a sweeping capital restructuring plan.
   The plan includes an offer to exchange about $665 million in
public and privately held bonds for a combination of stock and new
debt, and a deferment of a $153 million scheduled repayment of
principal due last month on $650 million in bank loans.
   SCI, which owns six television stations, said the ``overall
objective'' of its plan to realign its capital structure was to
reduce scheduled debt service requirements by an unspecified amount.
   In addition, it said the plan would give the company a chance
``to implement an orderly asset sales program.''
   A call was placed to a New York law firm said to represent
bondholders, but it was not returned.
   SCI Television, which was once part of the cable and TV company
Storer Communications, was created in 1987 when it was acquired in
a leveraged buyout.
   The company is 45 percent owned by the former shareholders of
SCI Holdings Inc., which had been organized in 1985 by the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. to buy the stations
from Storer, and 55 percent owned by Gillett Corp., controlled by
Nashville, Tenn.-based entrepreneur George Gillett.
   If bondholders and bankers accepted the plan, it would result in
current bondholders owning about 30 percent of the equity in the
company, Gillett with 41 percent, banks with 5 percent, the former
SCI Holdings shareholders with 15 percent and 9 percent to be
apportioned.
   Gillett would continue to manage the stations.
   The exchange offer is scheduled to expire at midnight Nov. 22.
   SCI said it must be tendered at least 90 percent of principal
amount of each series of previously issued securities under the
exchange offer for it to be obligated to make the exchange.
   The company said that in the event that the restructuring is not
completed, there ``can be no assurance that the company will not
elect to file for protection under applicable bankruptcy laws.''

<HEAD>Group Proposes Reorganization of Troubled Sharon Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARRELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group and the largest
unsecured creditor of Sharon Steel Corp. said Wednesday they have
agreed to co-sponsor a plan to buy the company's steel operations
and bring the company out of bankruptcy proceedings.
   The investment group, including New York-based Castle Harlan
Inc. and two former Sharon executives, proposes to acquire Sharon's
steel operations by paying cash and assuming liabilities in a deal
valued at more than $300 million.
   Quantum Fund, Sharon's largest creditor with claims exceeding
$100 million on the company's bonds, would purchase up to $50
million in equity in the new company.
   ``We're hoping and offering that other creditors join with us in
that infusion,'' said Raymond Wechsler, financial adviser to
Quantum, an investment fund, and co-chairman of the committee of
unsecured creditors.
   Sharon's profitable non-steel businesses, Mueller Brass Co. in
Port Huron, Mich., and coal, copper and gold properties, would be
shifted to a new company that would be owned by creditors.
   The plan, to be filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court within 60 days,
is contingent on financing.
   Sharon Steel filed for reorganization under Chapter ll of the
U.S. bankruptcy code on April 17, 1987, listing debts of $740
million. The company employs about 2,400 workers producing a
variety of carbon and specialty steel products.
   Despite the reorganization, Sharon has had to depend on its
non-steel operations to turn a profit.
   Walter Sieckman, former chief operating officer of Sharon and a
member of the Castle Harlan group, said another major creditor, AFC
Corp., has approved the plan. Quantum and AFC together control
about 40 percent of Sharon's debt to bondholders, he said.
   The bank group also includes former Sharon Executive Vice
President Wolfgang Jansen.
   Sieckman said the bidders assume there will be a mild recession
in the steel industry continuing through 1990. The company would
need about $100 million in capital improvements.
   He said he saw no reason to streamline Sharon's varied lines of
carbon and specialty steel products.
   ``We would like to make it bigger, more viable,'' he said.
   Herbert Minkel, a New York attorney representing unsecured
creditors, said the proposal dispels pessimistic predictions by
Sharon Steel's chief operating officer, E. Leonard Kern, who
replaced Sieckman.
   ``If you'd read some of his comments, you'd think there was no
one in the western world that would be interested in buying Sharon
Steel,'' he said.
   Kern has said Sharon Steel is losing money on its steel
operations and that unless production costs are reduced it might
not survive without continued support from its profitable non-steel
operations.
   Kern and United Steelworkers Local 1197 President Howard Clark
were not available for comment, their secretaries said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Kemper Financial Services Inc. said Wednesday it
had stopped doing business with four Wall Street firms involved in
computerized program trading, saying the strategy had scared away
investors by increasing stock market volatility.
   The Chicago-based money manager cited what it called the
``disruptive and destabilizing influence'' of the trading strategy,
which some blame for worsening the 1987 crash and the recent Friday
the 13th plunge.
   Kemper, which has about $7.5 billion in its stock portfolio out
of $57 billion in total assets under management, said it had ended
equity business with four firms that conduct program trading for
their own accounts. It did not identify the firms.
   The practice of trading millions of shares of stock in seconds
via computerized buy and sell programs _ which are used mainly by
huge institutional investors _ has been accused of heightening
stock market price swings. That volatility is seen as frightening
individual investors out of the market.
   After the 1987 crash, most major brokerages curtailed program
trading for their own accounts _ so-called proprietary trading _
but use of the strategy recently has increased.
   The New York Stock Exchange said program trading accounted for
13.8 percent of its average daily volume in September, up from 10.3
percent in August and the highest percentage since the exchange
began the calculation in July 1988.
   Some experts recently cited program trading as a factor when the
Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than 190 points in the
final hours of trading on Oct. 13 and 85 points this past Monday
morning.
   ``We believe that in the present environment, index arbitrage
generally increases intraday market price volatility, which
undermines investors' confidence in the fair functioning of
markets,'' said Stephen Timbers, Kemper's chief investment officer.
   ``We hope that this practice stops and prefer to conduct our
business with brokerage firms who do not engage in this trading
strategy,'' he said.
   Index arbitrage is a form of program trading that employs
computers to rapidly buy and sell huge blocks of stocks in New York
and stock-index futures in Chicago in an attempt to profit from
minute differences in prices on the two markets.
   In September, Salomon Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. conducted the most
program trading of Wall Street firms, according to the NYSE.
   Goldman and Salomon said they were not among the four cut off by
Kemper. Kidder, Peabody and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., another major
program-trading firm, declined to comment.
   A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, which resumed program trading
in February, said the firm does business with Kemper but had not
yet been informed whether it was one of the four.
   ``We believe that our position is reasonable,'' said the
spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. ``During periods of market
stress we will suspend proprietary arbitrage trading to avoid
contributing to intraday volatility.''
   Kemper's announcement was praised by several other money
managers, who said they also would consider discontinuing placing
stock orders with brokerages that engage in program trading for
their own accounts.
   ``I think those guys are terrific,'' said New York money manager
James Cramer of Cramer &amp; Co.
   ``We didn't have this horrible kind of volatility when these
firms were refraining from it,'' Cramer said. ``Now that they're
back we have the volatility.''
   ``Nobody needs that kind of volatility when there's nothing
different in the companies' outlook,'' said David Dreman, a
managing director of Dreman Value Management, which has $4 billion
in assets, about 85 percent in stocks.
   ``These methods work absolutely independent of the fundamentals
in the economy and the stock market.''
   Dreman said a boycott of firms that conduct index arbitrage
would be ``very effective'' and said his firm would consider one if
clients agreed to it.
   Defenders said program trading has been made a scapegoat for
often-normal market fluctuations. They blame market volatility not
on progam trading but on an overdependence on intermediate dealers
whose job is to bring together buyers and sellers.
   ``It's a shoot-the-messenger issue,'' said R. Steven Wunsch,
vice president for financial futures at Kidder, Peabody.
``Arbitragers do bring selling pressure from one market to another
market. But the selling pressure came first. They didn't cause it.''

<HEAD>Cineplex Odeon Founder Plans Bid for Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The feisty founder of Cineplex Odeon, North
America's second-biggest theater chain, plans to make a
multi-million-dollar bid to reclaim his company, Cineplex said
Wednesday.
   Garth Drabinsky, in concert with longtime partner Myron
Gottlieb, is putting together a deal already accepted in principle
by the company's two biggest shareholders, who together own a
majority of the stock.
   The proposal is worth 16.40 Canadian dollars a share, or about
781 million Canadian dollars for the 47.6 million shares
outstanding. However, Drabinsky and Gottlieb already control
between 7 percent and 8 percent of the stock and could join another
shareholder to make the bid, lowering their financing hurdle.
   In a statement, Cineplex said financing is still being arranged
and that the bid may not proceed. Under an agreement, the pair must
make a formal offer by Nov. 22.
   Drabinsky, who turns 41 on Friday, began his career as a lawyer
specializing in entertainment law. He founded the company a decade
ago in Toronto by building a pioneering multi-screen movie theater.
   Cineplex now owns 1,870 screens at 500 locations, all but one of
them in North America. It's the biggest chain in Canada, with 560
screens.
   The company is saddled with about 750 million Canadian dollars
in long-term debt, making the buyout package worth more than 1.4
billion Canadian dollars.
   ``We thought it was an appropriate and fair bid,'' said Sandra
Kolber, a member of a special committee of the Cineplex board
examining offers, from Montreal.
   The committee was formed following an abortive attempt by
Drabinsky in May to seize control by buying out the second-biggest
shareholder, Claridge Inc., controlled by Montreal-based
businessman Charles Bronfman.
   That move enraged MCA Inc., the Los Angeles-based entertainment
giant which owns the biggest block of Cineplex stock _ 23.6 million
shares. MCA succeeded in getting Canadian regulators to stay
Drabinsky's hand by insisting he make the same $17.50-a-share offer
to all shareholders.
   The Cineplex board then created the special committee to seek
buyout offers for the entire company. Wednesday's announcement _
with details of a bid in the works _ caps weeks of speculation,
although it left unanswered the big questions of financing and
whether there are other serious bidders.
   Neither Drabinsky nor Gottlieb responded to requests Wednesday
for comment.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Announces $9 Million Tax Settlement with Mercedes-Benz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. has paid $9.1
million in corporate taxes on its Massachusetts earnings, settling
a case Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said will be a landmark for other
states.
   The settlement ended a nearly 5-year fight between the state and
the Montvale, N.J.-based company that had argued it did not owe the
state a dime and had failed to contest a lawsuit in Massachusetts
courts seeking the payment.
   The state won a default judgment against the company in May in
Suffolk County Superior Court and seized a company-owned car from a
Mercedes executive this summer. The $74,000 car was auctioned by
the state and sold for $50,000, Dukakis said.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James M. Shannon said the
settlement was the single largest tax judgment in state history and
came about when he took steps to seize New Jersey property of
Mercedes.
   ``We're going to make sure the big guys pay their fair share of
taxes, not just the working men and women of Massachusetts,''
Shannon said.
   ``I hope it is a clear and concise message to all taxpayers,
especially corporate taxpayers, that it's not just the little guys
who pay taxes,'' said Dukakis, who has made collection of
delinquent taxes a priority in his administration.
   ``Mercedes-Benz is pleased that its tax dispute with the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts has been resolved in an equitable
manner through good-faith negotiations initiated by
Mercedes-Benz,'' company spokesman Bob Neary said in Montvale.
   Revenue Commissioner Stephen W. Kidder said the case began in
1985 when his department investigated six foreign car companies. He
said five were cooperative and paid $10 million in taxes, but
Mercedes declined until last month.
   ``Since then, they have been completely cooperative. We are
delighted they have seen the light,'' Kidder said.
   Mercedes-Benz had argued it did not owe Massachusetts any taxes
since it had no property in the state and since the imported German
cars were sold directly to dealers as they left ships in states
other than Massachusetts.
   But Kidder and Shannon said the company had employees based in
Massachusetts to handle warranty matters, state Lemon Law issues
and to work with dealers.
   In order to have to pay corporate taxes in Massachusetts, a
company must have some form of connection to the state, what tax
officials call a ``nexus.''
   Kidder said in most cases, it is clear whether or not a company
must pay.
   A chain of retail stores with headquarters in another state owes
Massachusetts corporate taxes on its income from Massachusetts,
Kidder said, while a company that does strictly mail-order business
from another state does not.
   Kidder said Wednesday's settlement covers Mercedes taxes from
1966, the year the state adopted a corporate excise tax, through
1985, the period covered by the lawsuit.
   Mercedes intends to file tax returns for the remaining years, he
said.
   ``It was a total victory,'' Kidder said.

the carrier announced Wednesday.
   Beginning Oct. 29, Pan Am will start three daily non-stop
flights from Miami International Airport to Philadelphia; two daily
non-stops to Boston, and a daily flight to Raleigh, N.C., and
Charlotte, N.C.
   In addition, the New York-based carrier plans to add a third
daily flight between Miami and Washington, D.C. Service from New

Sunday.
   In the Caribbean, Pan Am plans to begin daily flights to the
Cayman Islands, St. Maarten and Antigua.
   Also, Pan Am plans to resume a weekly flight between Miami and
Frankfurt, West Germany, that was suspended several years ago.
   By mid-December, Pan Am is scheduled to increase the number of
daily flights out of Florida to about 140.
   Pan Am presently operates 96 daily flights from Florida,
including 46 from Miami, the carrier's busiest hub.
   Miami-based Eastern is entering the ninth month of a strike by
Machinists, flight attendants and pilots.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. announced a 51 percent
increase in earnings for the third quarter, due partly to higher
sales and investment earnings.
   The Houston-based company's net income totaled $87 million, or
$2.02 per share, on sales of $683 million, compared with earnings
of $58 million, or $1.40 per share, on sales of $502 million in
last year's third quarter.
   ``In the U.S., Compaq market share is at an all-time high,''
said Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive officer.
   International sales accounted for 43 percent of the quarter's
sales, and were up 74 percent from a year ago, he added.
   For the first nine months of this year, Compaq reported earnings
of $254 million, or $5.94 per share, a 56 percent increase over the
$163.3 million, or $4.06 per share, last year. Sales totaled $2.1
billion, up from $1.4 billion.
   Compaq said the earnings for the quarter and nine months include
a non-recurring, pretax gain of $13.7 million resulting from an
increase in the carrying value of the company's investment in
Conner Peripherals Inc. The gains resulted from Conner's issuance
of additional common stock at prices higher than the carrying value
of Conner common stock owned by Compaq.
   During the quarter, Compaq purchased the former Wang
Laboratories manufacturing plant in Stirling, Scotland, which will
be used for international service and repair operations.
   Compaq makes desktop, portable and laptop personal computers
that are sold in 56 countries through a worldwide network of more
than 3,000 authorized dealers.

   Investigators searching for the cause of
a huge plastics plant explosion discovered three more bodies in the
twisted rubble Wednesday and continued the search for 17 others
presumed killed.
   In all, five bodies have been found since a series of explosions
ripped through the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant on Monday.
   Company officials learned that one man who had been listed as
missing was not at the plant at the time, plant manager Robert Benz
said.
   Assistant Secretary of Labor John Scannell, who heads the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, toured the plant
Wednesday with other federal investigators sent in by U.S. Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   ``It's total devastation,'' Scannell said. ``In 30 years of
experience in the chemical industry, I've never seen such massive
equipment twisted and strung about.
   ``It's still a very hazardous situation with twisted steel and
columns, the total destruction of some parts _ you can only imagine
the force of the explosion. Bolts were sheared right off and
twisted like pretzels.''
   The plant, which produced 4.5 million pounds of plastics a day,
exploded in a series of blasts Monday afternoon, throwing metal and
concrete debris as far as six miles. Miles of twisted strings of
pipe are piled haphazardly around the plant. Some buildings are
gone and eight giant chemical reactors vessels look like huge,
battered tin cans.
   OSHA had a team of 15 investigators, including chemical and
structural engineers, at the site. Scannell said they will help
with recovery operations and offer technical assistance and advice.
   ``And then we want to determine a cause,'' Scannell said. ``We
want to come up with prevention efforts to keep this from occurring
again.
   ``Virtually every piece of material is being looked at as a
piece of the puzzle,'' Scannell said, adding the OSHA crew expects
to remain at the site for several days. ``We'll be here as long as
it takes.''
   The area where authorities believe most of the 18 missing
workers are is a twisted jumble of rubble and debris. Scannell said
the recovery of victims ``could be days, could be weeks. It's very
complicated.'' Part of the problem is that when one piece of
wreckage is moved, it sets off a chain reaction of falling debris,
Scannell said.
   On Wednesday, the body of one of three contract workers
unaccounted for since the explosions was found in a maintenance
area in the morning. The two other bodies were found separately
later in the day, but both were in the same vicinity near a storage
area for poly-ethylene pellets, said Bill Wicker, another company
spokesman.
   Two other bodies were located earlier in the week. The
identities of the dead have not been released.
   Officials don't know yet exactly what caused the explosions.
Flammable ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking
chemical reactor, but Phillips officials said they don't know how
the gases were ignited.
   The plant manager repeated previous comments that the plant had
an excellent safety record that included a 5 million-man-hour
stretch with no safety-related work injuries that cost an employee
work time. That would cover a period of some 2{ years, Benz said.
   But union officials say they are questioning work schedules that
may have left less experienced or tired employees on the job.
   ``Our members tell us of long hours, cutbacks on staff and the
utilization of subcontractors within the plant,'' said Bob Wages,
national vice president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
union. ``We'd like to know if these were contributing factors to
the accident.''
   Phillips spokesman Jere Smith said the company likely will
rebuild at the site, but he was uncertain what type of facility
would replace the plastics plant.
   The plant's 900 workers will continue to be paid for at least
two months, he said, but some may be laid off later. Phillips will
try to find work for some of them at the company's other operations
in Houston and Sweeny.

<HEAD>Investors Group Offers $205 Million for Arby's Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investment group on Wednesday offered
to buy Atlanta-based Arby's Inc. for $205 million, despite
assertions by Arby's parent company that the fast-food chain is not
for sale.
   The offer came from Stevric Equity Ventures Inc. of Mineola,
N.Y., an investment group headed by brothers Richard E. and Steven
H. Buckley, two former officers of the Nathan's Famous Inc. hot dog
chain.
   Stevric's offer is the second bid for Arby's since August.
   The earlier offer of more than $200 million came from R.B.
Partners Ltd., a group formed by eight large Arby's franchisees,
part of a larger group known as A.P. Association Inc., which is
trying to force financier Victor Posner to sell the company.
   But DWG Corp., a publicly traded company controlled by Posner
that owns Chesapeake Financial Corp., Arby's parent, stressed again
Wednesday that Arby's is not for sale.
   An Arby's franchisee in Youngstown, Ohio, Joseph G. Smaltz, who
is part of R.B. Partners, said the group might find a deal with
Stevric acceptable.
   ``If these people would be successful in buying Arby's from Vic
Posner, that could be a step in the right direction,'' Smaltz said.
   The franchisee group has raised more than $1 million to fund its
efforts and is led by ousted Arby's president Leonard H. Roberts.
   Granada Investments Inc. of New York is waging a hostile, $572
million fight for Posner to take over all of DWG and has filed a
federal lawsuit against the company, based in Miami Beach, Fla., in
the hopes of having a trustee appointed to consider its offer.
