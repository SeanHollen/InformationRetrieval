   A convict serving a life sentence for drug
smuggling and the helicopter pilot who tried to spring him from
prison but crashed were charged Tuesday with conspiracy and
attempted escape.
   Ben Kramer, a nationally known powerboat racer serving a life
sentence for marijuana smuggling, and sea-urchin diver Charlie
Stevens, both 34, were charged Tuesday afternoon as they
recuperated at Jackson Memorial Hospital.
   Stevens crashed Monday as his two-seater Bell helicopter snagged
on a 14-foot wire security fence around the Metropolitan
Correctional Center during an attempt to take Kramer out of a
recreation yard.
   Kramer suffered a compound fracture to his left ankle and was
listed in satisfactory condition.
   Stevens, with two broken legs and injuries to the head, neck and
back, was in good condition.
   A court appearance has not been scheduled yet.
   ``Stevens started to take off from the compound with Kramer
hanging to the helicopter skids attempting to enter the cockpit,''
marshal Thomas Figmik wrote in the arrest affidavit. ``The
helicopter's blades became entangled in a security fence and the
helicopter crashed.''
   Authorities say Stevens, who most recently lived on the Oregan
coast, was an amateur pilot just learning to fly helicopters. In
December, he paid $35,000 in cash for the chopper from a California
flight instructor and got four hours of flying instruction.

<HEAD>Dartmouth Students Appeal Federal Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Dartmouth students have appealed the
dismissal of their lawsuit against the college, which they claim
discriminated against them because of their race and conservative
beliefs, a lawyer said Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Shane Devine last month dismissed a lawsuit
filed by the three white students, who were suspended after a
February 1988 classroom confrontation with William Cole, a black
music professor.
   Christopher Baldwin of Hinsdale, Ill., John Sutter of St. Louis
and John Quilhot of Fort Wayne, Ind., worked for The Dartmouth
Review, a conservative off-campus weekly newspaper that had
described Cole as part of ``Dartmouth's Dynamic Duo of Mediocrity.''
   They accused Cole of grabbing Quilhot by the arm and breaking
the flash on his camera during the encounter, but a campus
disciplinary board found them guilty of harassing Cole, and they
were suspended in March 1988.
   ``It's in our best interest to go through with the appeal,''
Baldwin said Tuesday.
   The student's lawyer, Francis Murphy Jr., said the three
disagreed with Devine's ruling that, even if the students
demonstrated that they were treated unfairly because of their
conservative politics and affiliation with the Review, they would
not have a case under the racial discrimination statutes they cited.
   The appeal was filed Monday in the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston, Murphy said.
   Sutter and Baldwin successfully sued the school in state court
to have their suspensions lifted in December, but Sutter dropped
out last month, four months before he was to graduate.
   State Superior Court Judge Bruce Mohl ordered Baldwin and Sutter
reinstated on the ground that one member of the panel that
disciplined them had been biased against the Review.

<HEAD>Principal Vetoes Article About Pregnant Valedictorian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school principal has pulled a story from
the school newspaper about the senior class valedictorian, a
straight-A honors student who is pregnant with her second child.
   Chester Smith, principal of Jack Yates High School, vetoed an
article by a student reporter about Carrie Mae Dixon, who is five
months pregnant and carries a full load of classes, including
physics, calculus and economics.
   The story, titled ``Against all odds ... Student becomes
valedictorian despite motherhood,'' details Miss Dixon's first
pregnancy, how she was shuffled among relatives after her mother
died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings, and her
dream of a ``middle-class home and a middle-class life.''
   Miss Dixon, who spends two to five hours a night with her books,
has no one to baby-sit her 18-month-old daughter, Terrisha
KeAndrea. She keeps the child occupied with paper and a pencil, and
``she writes while I write.''
   Miss Dixon, 17, has been accepted to the University of Houston
and has two scholarships. She plans to major in chemical
engineering.
   A school reporter first tried to do a story about Miss Dixon
last year after she was spotted on a cold, rainy day standing at a
bus stop, holding an umbrella over her daughter, while studying a
math text. A school official blocked the story.
   According to newspaper editor Shuronda Robinson, Smith rejected
the story Thursday when she submitted the newspaper for approval.
   Smith told reporters Tuesday that he thought the article was too
personal to be printed in the newspaper, and Houston Independent
School District Superintendent Joan Raymond agreed.
   ``In his judgment, the article was too highly personal,
sensitive to the young lady, and he did not permit it to be
published,'' she said. ``I have read the article myself, and I will
further tell you that I would have made the same decision.''
   Miss Robinson said the newspaper staff offered to edit the story
to satisfy Smith, but the offer was rejected. He also rejected a
request to run a blank space or the word ``censored'' in place of
the story.
   Although Miss Dixon has worried the school officials will bar
her from giving her valedictory address on graduation night June
10, Ms. Raymond said she will be allowed to speak and participate
in any graduation activity.

<HEAD>France Sends Arms To Cambodian Resistance For The First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France for the first time has sent arms
to guerrillas fighting Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, newspapers
today quoted a senior Thai officer as saying.
   The shipments are going to the forces of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, president of the three-party guerrilla coalition, said
Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong, the armed forces chief of staff.
   The latest shipment arrived a few days ago, Sunthorn was quoted
as saying Tuesday, according to The Bangkok Post, Thai Rath and
other newspapers. The arms are being shipped through Thai territory
to the guerrillas on the Thai-Cambodian border, the newspapers said.
   The reports said Sunthorn dismissed concerns the aid may affect
Vietnam's plan to and withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by
Sept. 30, ending a 10-year military occupation. Vietnam has
demanded a simultanous halt in outside military aid to the
guerrillas.
   Sunthorn said the Soviet Union, Vietnam's main source of foreign
aid, will continue to pressure Hanoi for a pullout.
   The resistance receives the bulk of its weapons from China.
   The strongest Cambodian resistance group, the Khmer Rouge,
seized power in Cambodia in 1975 and over the next four years
killed hundreds of thousands of people as they tried to create a
primitive agrarian society.
   Vietnam invaded in December 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge.
   France has been a strong diplomatic supporter of the resistance
and has played host to talks between Sihanouk and Hun Sen, the
prime minister of the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia.
   The French made Cambodia a protectorate in 1864 and granted
independence in 1953, with Sihanouk as its leader.

   A United Airlines Boeing 747 en
route to Sydney, Australia turned back to Auckland today when an
engine overheated soon after takeoff, the airline said.
   The plane landed normally with one of its four engines shut
down, said Wayne Dodge, United's manager for New Zealand.
   He said the pilot shut down the engine down when he realized it
was overheating. The plane was carrying 173 passenger and 18 crew
members.
   The passengers were transferred to an Air New Zealand flight,
which left soon after.
   ``It was a non-emergency. The pilot didn't have to dump fuel,''
Michael Merlini, United's manager for Australia, told The
Associated Press.
   United has had a rash of problems in recent weeks. In February,
a cargo door blew out on a jumbo flying the 811 route from Honolulu
to Auckland, sweeping nine people to their deaths.
   Late last month, a United 747 turned back to Auckland 45 minutes
after takeoff when an engine failed, and earlier this month a jumbo
damaged its undercarriage during a heavy landing at Sydney on the
flight from Auckland.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was quoted today
as saying an aide who demanded a policy decision at 2 a.m. probably
saved her life in 1984 when the IRA blew up the hotel where she was
staying.
   She was quoted as saying in an interview with Readers Digest
that she was about to go bed after working in her hotel suite until
2:45 a.m. when her private secretary, Robin Butler, insisted upon a
decision.
   She had been up polishing her keynote address to her
Conservative Party's annual conference.
   ``He thrust a set of papers into my hand and while I was reading
them, the explosion went off,'' Mrs. Thatcher was quoted as saying.
   ``Had I not been reviewing those papers, I would have gone
straight into the bathroom. Another person whose bathroom was a few
floors above mine had done exactly that and was virtually blown to
bits.''
   The Oct. 12, 1984, explosion wrecked the hotel where Mrs.
Thatcher and most of her Cabinet were staying for the convention in
Brighton, killing five people and injuring 30.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to push the British out of
Northern Ireland, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up
an all-Ireland socialist state.

   Put some racy, glittery commercials with lots of
naked bodies on movie screens in France and the audience goes wild.
   But do the same thing in the United States _ with the glitz but
without the nudity _ and the ads go over as big as sticky floors,
stale popcorn and overpriced candy.
   Richard Dodderidge, senior vice president for corporate
marketing at AMC Entertainment in Kansas City, Mo., said when AMC
tried the ads in theaters, audiences went beserk.
   ``There was public displeasure indicated by throwing popcorn
boxes at the screen and people wanting their money back,'' he said.
``They left home to avoid commercial television. They paid money
and expected relief.''
   ``I've been in theaters where people booed,'' said Barbara
Lippert, advertising critic for Ad Week magazine. ``On paper they
sound great ... but they can only be successful if they're really
artfully done and surprising.''
   In France, audiences get about 30 minutes of commercials, which
must by law be 90 percent entertainment. In American theaters,
though, audiences who are often asked to pay as much as $10 a
ticket, resent the intrusion.
   The ads would have more staying power if they helped lower
ticket prices, said Ed Swanson, senior vice president of sales and
marketing for Modern Talking Picture Service in Chicago, which
distributes corporate-sponsored films. He recalled a recent movie
outing with his family in which he paid $22 for four tickets _
after a $50 dinner check. ``If I'd have sat there and seen a
commercial I'd have been peeved.''
   ``Nobody likes commercials,'' said Terry Laughren, president of
Screenvision Cinema Network, a New York-based company that
distributes commercials. ``But there's a tremendous fascination in
this country for good advertising.''
   The clutter of commercials on television has been one force
behind the advertisers' quest for a more captive audience. Toyota
Motor Corp., General Motors Corp., 7-Up, Dr Pepper, Lee jeans,
Pepsi Co., Memorex and the U.S. Marines, have reeled out dollars to
give movie advertising a try.
   ``It seems to be growing pretty steadily,'' said Larissa
Alexandra, vice president of Screenvision in Los Angeles. ``With
TV, what you are trying to do is talk through clutter to get some
attention. There's no chance to get the emotional aspects of the
product.''
   Creators insist the ads are distinctly different from typical TV
commercials, and some of them can be edited for television.
   Dave Danzer, national advertising manager for Toyota, said the
directors hired to do the ads often have experience with feature
films and stunts such as car chases. He refused to divulge how much
Toyota spends on theater ads.
   One of Screenvision's most recent commercials features Toyota.
   ``It is hard to find anybody who reacts negatively,'' said
Laughren about the ad. ``To the concept, yes, there is negative
reaction, but then they say, `Oh god! That was a great
commercial.'''
   In the Toyota ad, which Danzer likens to the adventure formula
of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' a man dreams he's being chased
through a jungle in his Toyota four-wheeler by an imaginary threat.
There's no dialogue until he wakes up, looks out his window and
sees his Toyota sitting outside. Then an announcer says: ``Toyota's
new V64X4. Get it ... before it gets you.''
   Danzer didn't know if the ads helped sales, but he said they
were especially good at reaching males 18 to 34 years old, who are
typically light TV viewers.
   ``In the theater 95 percent of the people see your ad,'' Danzer
said. ``They might be eating popcorn, but they see the ad. With
television you have no idea whether they are going to look at it.''
   Michael Bernacchi, a professor of marketing at the University of
Detroit, has studied theater advertising and thinks companies
increasingly will want to see their products featured on the big
screen.
   ``Right now it's an outstanding way to communicate with
consumers,'' he said. ``Viewers will tend to ... receive them with
more interest and maybe chagrin. They may reject them in their
hearts, but they are probably going to stay in the saddle and
witness them.''
   The reason is a moviegoer's state of mind. Bernacchi said the
expectation is much different when people actually seek
entertainment.
   ``Few people go to the movies with the idea of just sitting and
casually attending. You go there with a purpose,'' he said.
   Bernacchi thinks the ads will thrive because in theaters there
is much less competition for a viewer's attention, and because the
cinema, unlike VCRs, don't offer the option of hand-held controls.
   However, some theater chain executives are less optimistic. They
say reaction from audiences has been so overwhelmingly negative
they risked losing business if they didn't pull the ads.
   ``We've tried it from time to time in different parts of the
country,'' said Russ Duncan, Chicago regional manager for General
Cinema. ``The company felt the good will between the patrons and
the company was somewhat compromised, and we valued the good will
of the patrons more than running the ads.''
   Duncan and Dodderidge said they weren't aware of any plans by
their respective companies to try the ads again, but that's not to
say their theaters are without commercials. Both General Cinema and
AMC feature ads on slides.
   ``The slides are very low key,'' said Neil Katcher, Detroit
district manager for AMC. ``You don't have to watch them if you
don't want to. Nobody complains about them.''

   Many Japanese workers transferring to
their companies' U.S. branches have a problem: American schools
don't prepare their children for the tough competition to get into
a Japanese university.
   Japan's solution _ and a testament to the growing Japanese
presence in this country _ is Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School,
which will be the first fully accredited Japanese high school in
America when it opens May 10.
   ``Our goal is to give education to the children of overseas
assigned business people,'' though the first class of 25 includes
only one student whose family lives in the United States, said
director Hiroshi Jo.
   ``Although we said it will be for American-based people, it will
be two to four years before we have enough enrollment to operate
that way,'' Jo said. He said families in Japan may have been more
familiar with the parent school, Meiji Gakuin University, than
workers already in the United States.
   ``Nothing is more important to Japanese families than the
education of their children,'' said former Gov. Lamar Alexander,
president of the University of Tennessee and scheduled keynote
speaker for the opening. ``College entrance is very competitive and
determined almost exclusively by results.
   ``If they fall behind while they're in the U.S., that is a very
dramatic problem for a Japanese family.''
   Owned and operated by the Tokyo university with the support of
Japan's Ministry of Education, the coed school will open with
grades 10, 11 and 12 on the Japanese school year, April through
March with 250 days of class.
   School was to start Saturday, but students and teachers ran into
problems getting visas, Jo said. ``I think maybe because this is
the first Japanese high school, (immigration officials) are
carefully handling reviewing this matter.''
   Sending a student to TMG, as it's called, will cost about
$19,000 a year.
   ``It may be more expensive than some can afford, but many send
kids to colleges that are quite expensive,'' Jo said. ``I also
think some companies will begin to subsidize overseas education.
That need is more and more confirmed by both the people of Japan
and the government.''
   The academic life will be pretty restrictive, he said. ``They
will have to check out of the dorms if they want to leave. And they
will have a lot of study requirements that will take a lot of their
time.''
   But the students, expected to number around 200 within two
years, will be encouraged to take advantage of being in another
country. They will go to class six days a week, as in Japan, but
the sixth day will be for outside activities.
   ``The students will certainly have a lot of contact with the
community,'' Jo said. ``The students can do regular high school
studies, plus have such a valuable experience as living in this
country.''
   For Sweetwater, a town of 5,310 between Knoxville and
Chattanooga, it could be sort of a stay-at-home cultural exchange
program.
   ``It will be a culture shock both ways, for the Japanese coming
here and for the community. Their philosophies of education and
living are different, so I think it will be an educational
experience for all of us,'' said Sweetwater Chamber of Commerce
President Charles Chamberlain.
   Meiji Gakuin paid $2.4 million for 144 rolling acres and 13
buildings, including two gymnasiums, a library and three
dormitories that can house a total of 220 students. It spent $1.5
million on renovation.
   TMG recruited in Japan and hired 12 teachers, four of whom _ two
single people and a married couple _ will live on campus. The
teachers will be paid what their counterparts in Japan are paid.
``There were many applications for every subject,'' Jo said.
   Alexander, who as governor from 1979-1987 heavily recruited
Japanese businesses, said the school ``could be a magnet for
industry, and I think it will be a wonderful thing for our own
educational system because it will give us a basis for comparison.
I think it's healthy to have. It means we don't have to go half way
around the world to discover what the competition is doing.''
   There are 71 Japanese-owned businesses in Tennessee employing
12,600. The largest is the Nissan truck plant in Smyrna. Others
include ACOM, which makes Panasonic electric components in
Knoxville; Sharp; Matsushita; and Komatsu.
   TMG will employ 12 people from Sweetwater and the surrounding
area, eight of them full-time _ including two cooks.
   ``They are in America,'' Jo said, ``So they should eat some
American food. Spaghetti. Cheeseburgers.''

<TEXT>
   After years of preaching racism and
hatred, the Rev. Richard Butler has lost some of his fire and
brimstone.
   At 71, he walks slowly and breathes with difficulty, still weak
from a heart attack suffered two years ago while awaiting trial on
charges of scheming to overthrow the U.S. government.
   Many followers of his white supremacist Aryan Nations church
have been jailed, or scared off by FBI investigations and publicity
from civil rights organizations.
   But this aging ``Aryan warrior'' hangs onto his dream of an
all-white homeland in the Pacific Northwest, seeking inspiration
from an unlikely source _ skinheads.
   ``They're the last hope, the only hope, of the white race,'' he
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Where others see menacing young thugs who shave their heads and
tattoo their bodies with swastikas, Butler sees the next
torch-bearers of racism. Butler is sponsoring the first national
neo-Nazi skinhead conference here this weekend to mark the 100th
birthday of Adolf Hitler, on April 20.
   The meeting worries law officers and rights activists, who until
recently were noting with satisfaction that membership in racist
hate groups seemed to be declining nationwide.
   ``Now, with skinheads, you have a pool of violence-prone,
ideologically sympathetic people who are being courted to join the
mainstream of the right-wing movement,'' said Marvin Stern,
northwest regional director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith.
   The Jewish group notes that many skinheads band together without
racist motivation. Those who can be classified as neo-Nazis,
however, number about 2,000 in 21 states, with the greatest
concentrations in Southern California and the Northwest, Stern said.
   In Portland, Ore., skinheads are awaiting trial in the death
last November of an Ethiopian man, who was fatally beaten with a
baseball bat. Another skinhead is accused of stabbing a black man
in Spokane, Wash. Swastikas painted on synagogues and assaults on
Jews, homosexuals and other minorities have additionally been
linked to skinheads in the region.
   Butler is not alone in courting skinheads. He's competing with
groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, led
by Tom Metzger in Fallbrook, Calif.
   ``Until now, skinhead groups have been mostly autonomous and
localized,'' Stern said. ``Any network Butler puts together bears
watching.''
   The network-building was visible last week as Butler and his
followers prepared for this weekend's conference at his northern
Idaho compound, 20 wooded acres tucked away on a gravel road near
the resort town of Hayden Lake.
   Two men hammered away in one of several rustic guest cabins. A
barefoot young woman leaned over a long canvas banner, stenciling
in ``Aryan Nations Now.''
   Taking time for an interview in the compound's modest church,
Butler resembled not at all the tough, urban youths he is wooing.
Dressed in a sweater vest, wool slacks and loafers, the
gray-haired, bi-focaled Butler played the part of a kindly country
preacher.
   Butler shrouds his racist message in religion, using scripture
to support his claims of white supremacy. He conceded that Biblical
quotations may turn off skinheads, not known for steady church
attendance.
   Many skinheads listen to the racist lyrics of Skrewdriver, an
industrial-grade British rock band. Butler wishes they would listen
to Beethoven.
   ``We want them to be able to think,'' he said. ``You can't think
if you're listening to the hard-rock jungle beat.''
   Despite the generation gap, Butler feels he offers something
these alienated youths can understand: a call to power in the name
of racial pride.
   ``The white male, through affirmative action, has been made a
non-citizen,'' he said. ``This is why you have skinheads. They're
beginning to wake up to the fact that they've been conquered and
that the land their fathers bled and died for has been taken away.''
   His little church in the pines has a guard tower that's higher
than the steeple. Inside, sunlight filters through stained glass
onto a huge Nazi flag. A poster showing a young man with an assault
rifle exhorts, ``Join Us, Aryan Freedom Fighters.''
   ``Kids like that kind of stuff _ it gives the idea that they're
in battle,'' Butler said, quickly adding that talk of battle was
only talk.
   Butler moved to Idaho in 1973 and over the years built up a
following based on his dream of a ``territorial imperative'' for
whites. He considered the Northwest an ideal homeland: rural,
conservative and lacking many blacks, Jews and other minorities.
   His dream was blocked not only by resistance from local
authorities but also by the violence of his own followers.
   Some former members, impatient with waiting for revolution,
formed a group known as The Order. The group's founder, Robert
Mathews, died in a fiery shootout with FBI agents in 1984 on an
island in Washington's Puget Sound. Ten Order members have been
convicted of racketeering, and 12 more pleaded guilty to various
crimes in a scheme that included murder, armored-car robberies and
plots to overthrow the U.S. government.
   Two years ago, Butler and 14 other white supremacists were
charged with plotting to overthrow the government. They were
acquitted last April, but Butler's arrest and the costly trial
crippled his already-weakened organization.
   Butler said weekly church attendance, which once peaked at 60,
now hovers around 40. Outside observers put the number even lower.
An Aryan Nations computer billboard, once touted as a high-tech
communications network for white supremacists, was discontinued
after the computer was stolen, Butler said.
   But just when his opponents figured he was washed up, Butler
announced plans for this weekend's skinhead conference. At first,
officials expected up to 250 skinheads, and Butler promised a march
down the streets of nearby Coeur d'Alene.
   In the face of fierce opposition from locals, Butler backed off.
He said he didn't want his supporters catching AIDS from
counter-demonstrators. And now he says he's expecting just 75 to
100 skinheads.
   He's planning a weekend of lectures, karate workshops and
campfire ``fellowship.'' He said lawyers will offer the skinheads
tips on how to build power legally.
   ``I hope to keep them from going to prison or getting killed.
They can do a lot more for the cause on the streets,'' Butler said.
``I want them to become a political force. That can come when they
have knowledge. When you have knowledge, you have power.''
   The idea of a white homeland in the Northwest is little more
than rhetoric bandied about by ideologues doomed by their own
extremism and violence, said Norman Gissel, president of the
Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations. The group is among
several planning civil rights activities this week to counter the
skinhead gathering.
   ``These people are their own worst enemies,'' Gissel said. ``Now
they're down to a church that has about 10 members and a handful of

<TEXT>
   This quiet resort town may have been
slow to recognize the racist threat of Richard Butler's neo-Nazi
sect, but civil rights leaders say their vigilance is now wide-eyed
and alert.
   Butler targeted the Northwest for an all-white Aryan Nations
homeland partly because of the region's conservative politics and
tradition of tolerance.
   ``The Aryan Nations miscalculated,'' said Tony Stewart,
president of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment.
``They did not find acceptance in the Northwest.''
   This week, as Butler prepares for a neo-Nazi skinhead conference
at his compound a few miles from Coeur d'Alene, civic leaders in
northern Idaho are planning a march, a picnic and an inter-faith
church service to celebrate cultural diversity.
   Butler's activities did not always provoke such responses. His
Aryan Nations church, established in 1973, was all but ignored for
years.
   ``You have a lot of kooks and nuts anywhere you go,'' said
Norman Gissel, president of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human
Relations. ``In north Idaho, especially, the sentiment is that you
leave your neighbor alone if he wants to be left alone.''
   That started to change in 1981, when swastikas appeared on a
Jewish-owned restaurant in Hayden Lake. The task force was formed,
but community participation remained low until 1985, when court
trials revealed ties between Butler's Aryan Nations and The Order,
a violent group that masterminded murder, bombings and armed bank
robberies.
   Coeur d'Alene's live-and-let-live demeanor changed forever the
morning of Sept. 29, 1986, when three bombs exploded in town,
planted by white supremacists as a diversion during a foiled bank
robbery.
   The next summer, when Butler held his annual Aryan World
Congress for about 200 white supremacist leaders, a civil rights
rally in Coeur d'Alene drew 1,000 people.
   The task force on human relations has served as a model for
about a dozen watchdog groups now operating in the Northwest,
Gissel said. The coalition Stewart heads is another offshoot,
monitoring hate crimes throughout the region.
   State lawmakers have also joined the fight against racism.
   ``Idaho now has the most comprehensive anti-hate crime
legislative package in the United States,'' said Stewart.
   Idaho is one of 18 states, and the only one in the Northwest,
with laws against paramilitary training. A ``malicious harassment''
law makes it a felony to assault someone on the basis of race,
religion or ethnic background. And that law will be strengthened by
another measure passed last month. It calls for an annual report on
hate crimes and requires law officers investigating any crime to
note whether harassment was involved.
   Civil rights leaders are confident the white supremacists will
never find their ``promised land'' in the Northwest. But they do
not plan to relax their vigilance.
   ``As long as they exist in any organized form, there is going to
be harassment to people of color, Jews and other minority groups,''
Gissel said. ``We're going to do whatever we can to hasten the day
when those types of activities cease to occur.''

   A federal agency defended the state's
bridge inspection program, despite the collapse of two Tennessee
bridges in two weeks.
   ``They have a good program with solid routine,'' Ira Deggs,
assistant director of the Federal Highway Administration's state
office, said Tuesday.
   Eight persons died in the collapse of a U.S. 51 bridge over the
Hatchie River near Memphis on April 1. A teen-ager was killed when
a railroad bridge collapsed near Oliver Springs in east Tennessee
on Saturday.
   An inspector four years ago urged repairs to the east Tennessee
bridge, but authorities never recommended that it be closed.
   An inspection of the U.S. 51 bridge also warned of problems.

   A little-known early 16th-century German sculptor,
Niclaus Weckmann the Elder, became a major figure in art history
when a woodcarving of his sold at auction for $423,000, Christie's
said.
   ``The price was a very high one for such a work,'' said Mark
Wrey, a spokesman for the auction house, after the sale Tuesday of
the Weckmann's Adoration of the Magi.
   The seller was described only as a continental nobleman.
   The buyer was anonymous but Charles Avery, the firm's head of
sculpture, said the work ``may be going back to south Germany,
which would be appropriate as that was Weckmann's homeland.''
   The limewood carving, more than five feet tall and four feet
wide, was once part of an altarpiece and depicts the wise men
presenting their gifts to the infant Jesus.
   ``It had been in the private chapel of a noble family in Styria
(Austria) for 100 years or so and probably no one else saw it,''
Avery said. ``If we knew where it had been for the 300 years before
that it would been even more costly as a complete antique
provenance adds to value,'' he said.
   Weckmann lived from about 1460 to 1520. His works were
attributed to other artists until 1968, when he was identified as
one of the greatest sculptors working in the town of Ulm around
1500.
   Avery said he was so impressed by the unsigned carving when it
arrived for auction that he asked for a study of it from Alfred
Schaedler, chief curator of sculpture at the National Bavarian
Museum in Munich.
   ``Schaedler is the expert on Weckmann and he attibuted it to him
on grounds of style and type. It is one of the largest and most
splendid pieces of Gothic German wood sculpture to be auctioned in
recent times,'' Avery added.
   As nothing identified as Weckmann's work had been auctioned
before, Christie's said they were uncertain how to estimate the
carving's price, at first setting it at $172,000 and then thinking
it might go up to $344,000.

   A Satanism expert is teaching police at a
five-day seminar that has drawn about 80 participants to recognize
signs of devil worship.
   The State Police-sponsored seminar on cults and the occult was
planned before the discovery earlier this month of a ritual mass
slaying blamed on drug smugglers in Matamoros, Mexico.
   Even before that discovery, ``we had inquiries from law
enforcement groups from throughout the state wanting to know if we
had any seminars on the topic,'' State Police Lt. Dan Ducote said
by telephone from Baton Rouge, where the seminar is being held.
   ``There's a lot of interest. A lot of officers had read in the
news media about areas with animal mutilations and such. They
wanted some knowledge on how to recognize the signs,'' said Ducote.
   The five-day seminar, which began Monday and involves law
enforcement officers from around the state, is taught by Tom Wedge,
author of ``The Satan Hunter.'' He has been a guest on several
national television talk shows.
   ``I wanted to know the difference between fact and fiction,
what's rumor and what's fact in what's occurring in Satanism,''
said Trooper Bob Buckley, a homicide investigator.
   ``I have felt that on two or three major crimes, there was a
possiblity the suspects were involved in Satanism. I want to be
able to go to a scene and tell,'' Buckley said.
   Ducote said devil worship is not illegal. ``But most of the
activity is a front for dealing in drugs,'' he said.
   Some ministers and businessmen recently announced plans to ask
the Legislature to outlaw Satanism.
   Businessman Fred Huenefeld, a bankruptcy trustee from Monroe,
said the interest in satanic worship stems from drugs and
Louisiana's poor economy.
   ``I'm handling 600 bankruptcies and I can tell you the impact on
the family unit,'' he said. ``The poor are looking for a way out
and a few misguided ones are looking to these cults. And, drugs
tend to get kids involved in these things.''

   Burt Reynolds, who couldn't make it
to a weekend barbecue for Vice President Dan Quayle, isn't really a
member of the Republican Party after all.
   In fact, The Palm Beach Post reports he hasn't voted since 1980
and is a registered Democrat.
   ``The issue is: What does a person consider himself?'' said
Reynolds' agent David Gershenson. ``If he's technically registered
as a Democrat, I know he considers himself a Republican.''
   Reynolds was invited to the Quayle barbecue in North Palm Beach
but sent his regrets because he was taping his ``B.L. Stryker''
television series.
   Despite a Post story saying Reynolds was a Democrat, he told
Jupiter Mayor Mary Hinton that he was a Republican.
   Publicist Kenny Miller said Reynolds registered in Palm Beach as
a Democrat in 1980 to vote for Jimmy Carter because he got to know
the former governor while making movies in Georgia.

   Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose insists he
has kept most of his baseball memorabilia, but admits he sold the
bat he used in 1985 to break Ty Cobb's record.
   Rose sold the bat, along with a Corvette he received from Reds
owner Marge Schott, to his insurance agent, Steve Wolter, for
$175,000. Rose still owns the bat he used for his 4,256th and final
hit, which he said he considers more significant than the one he
used for No. 4,192, which broke Cobb's record.
   ``I've got the bat that broke the record _ it's 4,256,'' said
Rose. ``The last hit I got is the record. And it will be the record
until somebody gets 4,257.''
   Rose put his three World Series championship rings on display
Monday to counter what he says are erroneous reports that he gave
his 1975 World Series championship ring to a convicted
Massachusetts bookmaker.
   A Boston newspaper reported Sunday that Rose gave the ring to
bookmaker Joseph Cambra, of Somerset, Mass., as payment for a
gambling debt. Rose said the 1975 ring that Cambra has is a replica
that Rose had authorized for him.
   The baseball commissioner announced last month he was
investigating allegations involving Rose, reportedly his gambling
activities and whether he has bet on baseball games.

   Actor James Woods is getting married next month
after a long romance with a woman he met at a gas station.
   ``He said he liked my truck,'' said Sarah Owen, 26, of their
chance meeting at a Chevron station on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles several years ago.
   Woods, 42, a rising star of movies and television, pulled up in
his black Porsche while Miss Owen said she drove her ``old pickup
truck with a bale of hay in the back.''
   ``He said he was thinking of getting a truck and he liked mine
... a really bad line,'' said Miss Owen, a co-owner of an import
business.
   ``I mean I had about as much need for a truck as a platypus has
for jumping shoes,'' Woods recalled during a stop in New York this
week to preview ``My Name is Bill W,'' a made-for-TV movie about
the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous that will be broadcast April 30
on ABC-TV.
   The couple already has moved the date of the wedding several
times and has yet to commit to an exact date or location. It will
be the second marriage for Woods but the first for Miss Owens.
   ``I always let my car go right down to empty now because its
good luck to me, obviously,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reserve Officers Say They Feel Like `Stone Fodder' In Uprising</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli army officers serving in the occupied
lands complain of feeling like ``stone fodder'' thrown into a
futile battle with Palestinians and say settler and army brutality
have corrupted Israel's morals.
   ``I am reaching the end of my thoughts about Zionism in this
country. My next war will be against Jews. That's what I feel,''
said one officer, Uri Dan.
   His comments and those of 10 other reserve officers appear in
``Commanders' Reflections,'' a 34-page booklet published by the
Kibbutz Artzi movement that unites 85 of Israel's 160-odd
kibbutzim, or communal farms.
   The booklet, released on Tuesday, quotes remarks made by the
officers, members of kibbutzim, in a February conversation with
Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, head of the army's central command. Their
ranks were not given.
   The officers single out army regulations on opening fire, lack
of proper ammunition, pressure of increased reserve duty and their
feeling of futility in dealing with the Palestinian revolt.
   The 16-month uprising _ known to Arabs as the ``intefadeh'' _ in
the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip has claimed at least 439
Palestinian and 18 Israeli lives.
   ``Once in four, five months you are called to intefadeh, and you
see that nothing has changed, maybe it only got worse. I can even
say that ... in a certain way, you feel like stone fodder,'' said
Omri Frish of the kibbutz Mesilot.
   Army rules on opening fire, which forbid troops to shoot live
ammunition unless a danger to life exists, still ``leave the final,
last and only consideration to the lonely soldier in a side
alley,'' Frish said.
   Frish said that as to the alternative plastic or rubber bullets,
these may be hard to find.
   ``The means we have at our disposal ... are very poor. A soldier
asks his commander, why we have no rubber bullets, or helmets, or
this, or that, and it's a problem,'' he said.
   Other officers criticized even the use of plastic bullets.
   Avi Ofer of kibbutz Maanit in central Israel said rules allowing
such bullets to be fired for riot dispersal were ``illegal.''
   ``There are so-called `plastic bullet ambushes.' One soldier
provokes the residents, one of the duped residents hurls a stone,
and another (soldier) is ready with a plastic bullet,'' said Dani
Gal of the Kfar Menahem kibbutz.
   Elisha Shapira of Ein Hashofet said he complained to army
authorities who took action against two lieutenant-colonels posted
in Nablus, the largest West Bank town.
   ``They engaged in manhunting ... they were just driving around,
looking for a possibility to harm an Arab,'' Shapira said, without
elaborating.
   Some officers said they reached a breaking point during night
search-and- arrest raids.
   ``I don't think I can enter at 2 o'clock at night into a house
where 10 small children are crying, and take people away, their
father or somebody ... This is not my job, this is not what I was
trained for in the army,'' said Yehiam Yogev of Kfar Menahem. ``I
just cannot do this.''
   An army spokesman, asked for comment, said the military had ``no
opposition to the expression of officers' opinion, as long as it's
done by proper channels.'' He said no official statement on the
booklet was expected.
   The spokesman, who commented anonymously in keeping with
military rules, said that in specific cases, when the reservists
``see something that is not acceptable in society or in the
framework of army rules, they can complain through the many
existing channels, and many have done so.''
   However, one senior officer indicated the army establishment was
worried by the appearance of groups ``that used their military
ranks for political statements.''
   The booklet was especially painful for the military. Although
Israel's kibbutz movement is traditionally leftist, many of its
members volunteer for service in elite army units, seeing it as a
supreme value.
   The booklet also contains strong attacks on some of the 70,000
Jewish settlers living in the occupied territories among 1.7
million Palestinians.
   ``We have encountered ... several events in which the settlers
took the law in their hands, made a real pogrom, beat the Arabs,''
said one participant, identified only as Yair.
   Others spoke of the existence of armed settler militias.
   ``I know these exist. I personally spoke to a man who told me he
was organizing 40 boys with ammunition belts and radios, so they
respond properly,'' said Dan, of Nir Oz kibbutz.
   The commanders said they opposed refusal to serve in the
occupied territories, but expressed fear about the implications of
the continuing conflict there on the army and on Israeli society as
a whole.
   ``They make us kill them. The Jewish people will not be able to
withstand this,'' said Elie Ben-Gal of Baram. ``I am telling you,
they will not be able to withstand this.''

<TEXT>
   Contra rebels attacked a rural house
in southeastern Nicaragua, killing three people and injuring two,
the Defense Ministry announced.
   The attack, announced by the government Tuesday, occurred Monday
night in the Rio Kama area in the Zelaya Sur province, 400 miles
southeast of Managua.
   A military source said the attack was launched by ``mercenary
forces loyal to the terrorist policies of former Somoza colonel
Enrique Bermudez.''
   Bermudez, head of the Miami-based Nicaraguan Resistance, said
during talks with Nicaraguan opposition political leaders last week
in Guatemala that he had ordered his forces to observe a cease-fire.
   Gustavo Tablada, a Socialist leader in Nicaragua who met with
Bermudez last week, said Bermudez told him some rebels might be
working in concert with common criminals.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance, which heads up the Contra rebels, has
received U.S. backing to fight the leftist Sandinista government
since 1981, but the Contras now receive only non-lethal aid and are
mostly in Honduran camps.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 popular revolution by
defeating former President Anastasio Somoza.

   Gov. George Deukmejian is urging
Californians to listen to their mothers.
   The governor joined Jackie Stallone and Georgia Holt, the
mothers of actors Sylvester Stallone and Cher, in kicking off a
campaign on Tuesday to promote ride sharing and van-pool programs
to help unclog freeways.
   But he was a little late because of traffic congestion.
   The campaign will feature the theme of rather universal motherly
sayings. One advertisement depicts a woman who says: ``We're not
the first one to try to talk some sense into you about sharing.''
   Other celebrity moms taking part include Laurie Williams, mother
of comic Robin Williams, and Christine Johnson, mother of Los
Angeles Lakers basketball star Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson.
   ``Your mother, as this (campaign) says, always told you to share
and it was good advice then and I think it's very good advice now,
and it's going to help us to meet our transportation challenges,''
Deukmejian said.
   Deukmejian said California is the sixth-largest economic power
in the world but each day workers lose about 400,000 hours of
productivity while stuck in traffic.
   Last year, 22.4 million vehicles were in the state and there
will be 23.8 million by the century's end. There is an average of
1.2 persons per vehicle in peak hours, but congestion could be
eliminated if that improved to just 1.4 per vehicle, Deukmejian
said.

   State Sen. Bob Swain got little attention
when he introduced a bill to designate an official state dog, but
now the ``Plott'' has thickened.
   The Senate Rules Committee quickly endorsed the bill to make the
Plott hound North Carolina's official dog. Lucy, a 10-year-old
Plott owned by former Rep. Hugh Lee, wagged her tail in silent
approval.
   ``All other breeds pale in comparison,'' said Swain, a Democrat
who said the hound is the only dog indigenous to North Carolina.
It's a favorite of mountain bear hunters, he said.
   ``It's the only dog I think would be proper for a state dog,''
Lee told reporters after the meeting Tuesday.
   ``You talk about a Plott, you're talking about the Kit Carsons,
the Davy Crocketts and the Daniel Boones of the dog world,'' Lee
said. ``They were frontier people, they went out hunting and lived
by their instincts ... and they were from western North Carolina.''
   The Plott hound is a descendant of a German breed used for boar
hunting, Swain said. An immigrant named Jonathan Plott brought it
to North Carolina in the mid-1700s.
   The Plott hound is an officially registered breed, Swain said.
The typical Plott has brown-black coloring and weighs about 75
pounds.
   ``I think without any question it has all the qualities of a
good North Carolinian,'' Swain said. ``He's loyal, he is fearless,
he has perseverance.''
   The Rules Committee approved Swain's bill without dissent. It
now goes to the Senate floor.

   The Missouri Senate passed a bill
making the 250-million-year-old remains of a plantlike animal the
official state fossil.
   But some senators objected to spending time on the matter with a
May 12 adjournment and several major bills pending.
   ``Is it any coincidence that you are trying to make the state
fossil a spineless animal?'' Sen. Jay Nixon asked Tuesday. ``What's
next? Perhaps the bat will be the state bird because it's blind.''
   The state bird is the bluebird.
   Nixon said the crinoid fossil bill ``reflects the quality of
legislation so far this session.'' He said he was concerned the
headlines would read, ``Senate spends afternoon making spineless
wimp the state fossil.''
   But the bill's sponsor, Sen. Robert Johnson, called the measure
an important civics lesson for an eighth-grade science class in his
district that first proposed it.
   ``Now they've seen an idea from their classroom go through both
chambers for a possible signing by the governor,'' he said.
   Crinoids, commonly known as sea lillies, flourished 250 million
years ago when most of Missouri was covered by shallow seas. They
are found throughout the state, mainly in limestone deposits.

<HEAD>Closed Lab told To Pay For Millions Of New Pap Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State health officials ordered a laboratory
to offer to pay for repeat Pap smear tests for more than 3 million
women diagnosed as cancer-free after learning the lab's error rate
was greater than 20 percent.
   Central Pathology Services Medical Group of Tarzana, which has
performed 3.3 million Pap smears over the past five years, was
ordered closed last week after a state audit showed an error rate
of 21.2 percent among 1,103 tests selected at random.
   ``It was a sloppy operation,'' said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, state
health services director. ``It was totally unacceptable that they
had such a high error rate.''
   The lab, which also worked under the name Central Diagnostic
Laboratory, processed nearly 700,000 smears last year, more than
half of all of the tests in Southern California.
   Pap smears from California, Arizona, Chicago and Philadelphia
were processed at the company's Tarzana area lab.
   In its order delivered to the lab Monday, the health department
said all women in California and other states who had received
reports indicating no abnormalities from either Central Pathology
or Central Diagnostic within the last five years needed to be
offered the opportunity for a repeat Pap smear.
   The lab, which closed Monday, was given 30 days to contact the
women and recommend they see their doctors about retaking the tests
elsewhere.
   Central Pathology said in a statement it was ``a 27-year-old
facility with a perfect inspection record to this point'' and that
it had recently instituted what it called ``the most stringent
quality-control standards in the nation.''
   The Pap smear, which costs about $25, is a routine test used to
detect cervical cancer and other medical abnormalities.
   The industry average for misdiagnosing Pap smears is about 5
percent, but some pathologists said top labs make even fewer
mistakes.
   Kizer said state officials plan to inspect 10 other Pap smear
laboratories within the next six weeks. He did not identify them.
   ``We need to get an idea of the other labs' error rates and set
some kind of standard,'' Kizer said.

<HEAD>Barry Manilow Opens for Month on Broadway</HEAD>

   Barry Manilow, master of the big ballad, brought
his talent for showmanship to Broadway on Tuesday night for a
month-long engagement.
   Mixing show-biz sophistication with pure corn, ``Barry Manilow
at the Gershwin'' is strong entertainment.
   The production is sleek, with costumed backup singers and
projections on the back wall. Manilow inserts a rock beat in a few
numbers, tackles the Motown sound a couple of times, and does one
superfast Lambert Hendricks and Ross jazz number, ``Cloudburst,''
that he admired early.
   Though he's no slouch with those styles, the lengthy romantic
ballad, given a big buildup to an emotional finish, is his
strongest suit. He started the second half of the evening with
three new songs of that type, pointing up once again that his style
is grounded in a performance tradition older than rock.
   In an autobiographical portion of the show, the singer-pianist
picked up the accordion, which he said he learned (and hated) at
age 11, two years before he learned piano. In front of a set
representing the Brooklyn apartment where he grew up, he
demonstrated that even Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.''
sounds old-fashioned on an accordion.
   He also talked about being a pianist for singers auditioning for
Broadway, but didn't mention his hitch as musical director on Bette
Midler's 1973 tour, after which he got a recording deal and had his
first hit, ``Mandy.''
   Manilow ended the evening with a medley of many hits, including
``One Voice,'' ``The Old Songs,'' ``I Don't Want To Walk without
You,'' ``Copacabana,'' ``This One's for You,'' ``Tryin' To Get the
Feeling Again,'' ``It's a Miracle,'' ``Somewhere in the Night,''
and ``I Write the Songs.''

<HEAD>Air Pollution Bill Aims at Broader Variety of Toxics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate sponsors of a compromise bill to
control airborne toxic chemicals say they expect stiff opposition,
despite growing information on poisons in the nation's air.
   ``This bill will be critized by some for going too far, and by
others who don't think it has gone far enough,'' Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said Tuesday after he and 11
other senators introduced the legislation.
   The bipartisan and diverse group said their language remains
subject to hard bargaining, but emphasized they have a consensus on
how to control the estimated 2.7 billion pounds of poisonous
chemicals released into the atmosphere each year.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, in its first such
compilation, said April 12 that the toxic air emissions are among
more than 22 billion pounds of toxic wastes sent into the air,
water and land each year.
   The legislation to control toxic emissions into the atmosphere
represents a major compromise for lawmakers pushing for new clean
air legislation this year. Senate clean air sponsors said they will
introduce the other components of their legislation in coming
months: proposals to bring metropolitan areas in compliance with
air quality standards, and language to control acid rain.
   The air toxics compromise would require companies emitting 10
tons or more of any airborne toxic chemical to install the best
available control technology.
   The Environmental Protection Agency would set emissions
standards for industries releasing the chemicals. But to encourage
polluters to make immediate and large-scale reductions, they would
be granted exemptions if they used technology that achieves a 90
percent cutback in emissions by the end of 1992.
   If technology did not achieve the required reduction, a company
would have to meet tough emissions limits based on a chemical's
risk of causing cancer or other illnesses.
   The legislation would replace a system that has regulated only
seven toxic chemicals out of nearly 300 emitted into the air.
   The EPA is currently required to assess the risk of each
chemical, and then develop chemical-by-chemical emissions standards
designed to protect public health, with an ample margin of safety.
   The assessment for each chemical takes several years. And when
the EPA has made proposals, the agency has been sued on grounds it
went too far _ or not far enough.
   The bill also would direct EPA to establish a national urban air
toxics program to reduce the release of toxic chemicals from motor
vehicles, wood stoves, dry cleaners and gas stations.
   In a provision to prevent catastrophic accidents, the bill would
require EPA to list 50 extremely hazardous substances. Facilities
handling those materials would have to complete reviews to identify
potential accidents. A Chemical Safety Board would be established
to investigate accidents and make recommendations for preventive
measures.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the manager of Senate clean air
legislation this year, told reporters, ``There is a public health
crisis that will worsen if we don't act.''
   Ed Barks, spokesman for the National Clean Air Coalition, said
the environmental groups in the organization believe the bill needs
improvements.
   He said that under the bill the EPA could take between five and
13 years to set standards for emission reduction for polluters who
fail to qualify for the exemption. That timetable is too long, he
said.
   Announcing the compromise were Sens. David Durenberger, R-Minn.;
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.; John Breaux, D-La.; Baucus; John Chafee,
R-R.I.; Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.;
Mitchell; John Warner, R-Va.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., and James Jeffords, R-Vt.

<HEAD>Nation's Leading Little Cities Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small communities like Gallup, N.M., and
Greenwood, Miss., should flourish in coming years as people flee
both big cities and suburbs while businesses seek out new markets,
says population researcher G. Scott Thomas.
   Although attention and headlines focus on the major metropolitan
areas, ``micropolitan'' America may become increasingly popular,
Thomas says in the May edition of American Demographics, a magazine
focusing on population issues.
   ``An increasing number of people are growing tired of central
cities where crime rates are getting out of sight,'' Thomas said
Tuesday in a telephone interview. ``In the suburbs as well, housing
prices are getting extremely high, schools are crowded, people are
showing an interest in getting away to areas where they have more
control of their lives.''
   ``Smaller cities are as influential in their regions as
metropolitan areas are on a larger scale,'' reported Thomas, who
operates the research firm Niagara Concepts in Tonawanda, N.Y., a
suburb of Buffalo.
   Thomas defines a micropolitan area as a county with a population
of at least 40,000 people, with a core city including at least
15,000 _ but not a part of a metropolitan area. Metropolitan areas,
which are officially designated by the federal Office of Management
and Budget, are economically related counties generally focusing on
a central city of 50,000 people or more.
   He reports that between 1980 and 1986 some 83 micropolitan areas
grew faster than the nation as a whole. That amounted to 38 percent
of micropolitan areas, he said. In the same period 45 percent of
the larger metropolitan areas were growing faster than the national
rate.
   Many of these communities are already showing their popularity.
   Leading the small city growth was Rio Rancho, N.M., which
increased by 48.6 percent over the six years. Helping was that
city's nearness to fast-growing Albuquerque, Thomas reports.
   Like metropolitan areas, the fastest growing micropolitans
tended to benefit from Sun Belt locations. Indeed, of eight that
increased by more than 25 percent over the six years, seven were in
the Sun Belt.
   Quick growers between 1980 and 1986, besides Rio Rancho, were
Bullhead City-Lake Havasu, Ariz., 37.1 percent; Vero Beach, Fla.,
35.2; Hilton Head Island, S.C., 31.0; Huntsville, Texas, 29.4;
Myrtle Beach, S.C., 28.8; San Luis Obispo-Atacasdero, Calif., 26.5;
and Fairbanks, Alaska, 25.3.
   Torrington, Conn., had the highest per capita income of the more
than 200 micropolitan areas studied by Thomas.
   Torrington reported incomes of $13,381 per resident, he said.
Fairbanks was second at $13,079, followed by Bartlesville, Okla.,
$13,035; Key West, Fla., at $12,319; and Vero Beach, Fla., $12,155.
   Many micropolitan areas are the homes of major universities,
Thomas observed, resulting in several communities with high median
educational levels.
   Corvallis, Ore., and Pullman, Wash., led that list with 14.2
years of schooling completed for the typical resident aged 25 and
over. Bozeman, Mont., was next at 13.5, followed by Ames, Iowa, at
13.4. Others with medians of 13 years of schooling or more were
Ithaca, N.Y., and Logan, Utah, 13.2, and Manhattan, Kan., 13.0.
   Here is a quick look at the top five micropolitan areas in other
categories measured by Thomas:
   _Oldest Median Age:
   Vero Beach, Fla., 39.4; Prescott, Ariz., 39.0; Hot Springs,
Ark., 37.2; Bullhead City-Lake Havasu, Ariz., 37.0; Pottsville,
Pa., 36.8.
   _Youngest Median Age:
   Gallup, N.M., 22.0; Hinesville, Ga., 22.1; Mount Pleasant,
Mich., 22.5; Manhattan, Kan., 22.6; Radcliff-Elizabethtown, Ky.,
23.0.
   _Percent Black:
   Greenwood, Miss., 59.1; Orangeburg, S.C., 56.0; Greenville,
Miss., 55.6; Selma, Ala., 54.6; Roanoke Rapids, N.C., 47.1.
   _Percent Hispanic:
   Alice, Texas, 67.2; Del Rio, Texas, 62.9; El
Centro-Calexico-Brawley, Calif., 55.8; Carlsbad, N.M., 30.7;
Roswell, N.M., 30.6.

<HEAD>Positive Outlook Promotes Killer Cell Activity, Studies Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A positive outlook on life appears to promote
natural killer cell activity for fighting disease in certain cancer
patients as well as healthy individuals, according to studies
presented today.
   ``It doesn't seem to be so much whether one is exposed to stress
or not, but how people are reacting to similar types of stress,''
said Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute and part of the research team.
   ``If they're not as well adjusted ... we have indication that it
has health consequences.''
   Herberman and Dr. Sandra Levy, an associate director at the
institute, say they have found that colon and skin cancer patients
who combine standard medical care with psychotherapy have higher
natural killer cell activity than those who do not undergo
counseling.
   In a separate study being presented at a medical symposium at
Johns Hopkins University, they said healthy people with positive
outlooks have higher natural killer cell activity than physically
fit complainers.
   The upbeat subjects suffered fewer colds and other viral
infections. Their ailments also did not last as long as illnesses
suffered by those expressing ``more hostility and anger about their
life,'' said Herberman, who followed the subjects for six months.
   These findings, based on an analysis of 120 men and women
between ages 18 and 45, confirm the results of a smaller pilot
study conducted by Herberman and Levy three years ago at the
National Cancer Institute.
   ``We were looking at how serious the stresses were to them ...
their hassles, things that happen to all of us, fights with the
boss, that kind of thing,'' Levy said in an interview Tuesday night.
   James Zabora, director of patient and family services for the
Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore and the symposium's
co-director, called the findings ``interesting'' but said they must
be kept in perspective.
   ``They're moving into a very difficult area,'' Zabora said.
``The immune system is an incredibly complicated system and maybe
to this point in time we have examined 1 percent or 0.5 percent of
what the immune system is all about.''
   Researchers currently can only speculate why happiness seems to
promote activity of natural killer cells, which comprise 5 percent
to 10 percent of all white blood cells, according to Herberman. One
theory is that a positive perception of stress produces certain
hormones that affect the body's immune system.
   ``It isn't clear what's going on,'' Levy said. ``All we're
asking is whether behavior or central nervous system-mediated
factors play some role for some tumors. If they do, that's
important because behavior can be changed.''
   To test that notion, Herberman, Levy and Dr. Judith Rodin,
professor of psychiatry at Yale University, followed 30 people
between ages 18 and 45 with colon cancer or malignant melanomas.
All had had their tumors surgically removed, and the disease had
not reached advanced stages.
   Eighteen received individual counseling once a week for eight
weeks. The remaining 12 received only standard medical care. Both
groups were identical in background.
   By the end of psychotherapy, the 18 with counseling showed
significantly higher natural killer cell activity than those
without, Levy said. The counseled group reported less depression
and anger and seemed better able to cope with their lives, she said.
   The 12 who did not undergo psychotherapy tended to blame
themselves for their problems, Levy said.
   ``We don't believe ... that your psychological status is going
to make the difference as far as whether the disease is present or
not,'' Herberman said. ``But on top of all the physical issues, the
nature of the disease and the body's immune response to it, the
psychological factors can have a significant effect.''
   Additional studies are needed before any recommendations can be
made regarding psychotherapy.
   ``Time will tell as to how much that is going to make a
difference as far as survival or staying tumor-free,'' Herberman
said.

<HEAD>Bush Says Spring Payments Will be Faster, Other Programs Face Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says farmers who signed up in
this year's crop programs will soon get speeded-up payments
totaling about $850 million to help them with spring planting.
   But Bush also warned Tuesday that ``perilous budget-deficit
times'' will mean cuts in other farm programs. He did not say what
other cuts may be involved.
   Bush and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter participated in a
telephone interview program with a group of farm broadcasters. The
president said he authorized the acceleration of price-support
payments ``to provide some extra money to farmers early in the crop
year.''
   The $850 million in payments will be made after May 15 to
producers of wheat, feed grains, rice and cotton who signed up in
the 1989 programs and requested advance payments.
   While Bush said the speeded-up payments show that ``we are with
the American farmer in these tough times,'' a principal goal of the
change is to reduce the red ink in his fiscal 1990 budget.
   The payments now shift the $850 million out of fiscal 1990,
which begins on Oct. 1, and into the current fiscal year.
   About $3.13 billion in advance payments were already paid to
farmers during the program signup period, which ended on April 14.
The $850 million will be on top of those advances.
   Bush, putting on headphones in a small USDA broadcast booth,
answered questions from agricultural broadcasters for about 15
minutes. The program was sent out over the agency's agricultural
radio network.
   The president also announced creation of a working group on
rural development to be headed by Yeutter. He said the group would
evaluate existing federal rural-development programs and make
recommendations.
   ``Events such as last year's drought reinforce the need to
develop and diversify the rural economy in the years ahead,'' Bush
said.
   The price announcement made by Bush makes an additional 10
percent available to farmers in so-called advance deficiency
payments.
   Tuesday's action raised the size of advance payments wheat and
feed-grain farmers can collect from 40 percent to 50 percent, and
the share rice and cotton farmers can collect in advance from 30
percent to 40 percent.
   The advances are against anticipated government subsidies to
help farmers recover the difference between market prices and
federally set target prices.
   One interviewer asked Bush how he reconciled heavy cuts in farm
programs under the budget compromise recently negotiated by the
White House with his campaign vow not to balance the budget on
farmer's back.
   ``We are in perilous budget-deficit times. We've got to get the
deficit down. And the best thing we can do to help the American
farmer is to get these interest rates down. And the best way to do
that is to make the tough decision on the spending side of our
budget,'' he said.
   ``Yes, `ag' is taking a hit. But so is a wide array of programs
across the board.''
   Asked if the speedup in payments would be the sum total of
federal help for producers who are being hurt by the drought
gripping Kansas and much of the winter wheat area, Bush said:
``This should not be viewed as the definitive answer. We hope it is
something that will help the farm family.''
   Yeutter added: ``Clearly we don't have an open spigot that just
spits out federal dollars in any situation today. But we'll be as
sympathetic and as accommodative as we can be within rather severe
budgetary restraints.''
   After Bush left to return to the White House, Yeutter continued
taking questions from the broadcasters. Asked about reports that
the government's program to subsidize exports of wheat and other
farm commodities is being scuttled, Yeutter said no such plan is in
the works. However, Yeutter reiterated that the USDA's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP, will come under review.
   But no EEP allocations now in effect will be curtailed, he said.
The program provides subsidies to private exporters for the sale of
designated commodities to specific countries at reduced prices. The
object is to make U.S. products competitive with those from other
foreign suppliers, notably the European Economic Community.
   ``All that is at issue at the moment is any future allocations
that might be made'' under EEP, he said. Those will be considered
on a case-by-case basis ``primarily because of our stocks (of
grain) condition and the weather conditions that now prevail.''
   Some consumer advocates have urged cancellation of EEP because
drought-reduced production last year helped trigger a heavy drain
on U.S. grain stockpiles. Moreover, with drought persisting in some
areas, particularly in parts of the Great Plains wheat belt, there
is much uncertainty about 1989 production.

<HEAD>Senators Ask if Reagan Withheld Iran-Contra Documents</HEAD>

   President Bush is being pressured by two
senators to investigate whether the Reagan administration failed to
turn over documents detailing secret arrangements to help the
Contras, including Bush's involvement.
   The White House said Tuesday that the Reagan administration had
made the documents ``available'' in 1987, but did not specifically
say whether they had been turned over to Congress.
   The documents, which emerged at Oliver North's criminal trial,
spell out President Reagan's approval of a deal in which Honduras
got more than $110 million in extra U.S. aid as payment for
supporting the Contras in 1985.
   Bush informed the Honduran president of the extra aid, but it
isn't clear whether the then-U.S. vice president knew the
assistance was a payoff for Contra backing. Bush has refused to
comment on what he knew.
   ``We address this letter to you personally to underscore the
gravity of the matter if there has been, in fact, a failure to
produce these documents to Congress,'' said the letter, released
Tuesday. It was written the previous day by Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   Inouye was chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra committee and
Mitchell was a member.
   ``We respectfully request that you direct an immediate and
thorough investigation and report to determine whether any
documents were not provided to the Senate Select Committee,''
stated the letter.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater responded Tuesday that
all documents identified in the letter from Mitchell and Inouye
``were available to the independent counsel and the Iran-contra
investigating committee.''
   He added that ``all such documents related to the Iran-contra
case were certainly accessible to the independent counsel, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Iran-contra committee.''
   The congressional Iran-Contra committees uncovered third-country
support for the Contras, but it didn't turn up the quid pro quo
arrangements which helped secure the foreign Contra backing.
   The Honduran deal was part of a secret approach the Reagan
administration made to at least 11 countries in which it sought
help for the rebel force due to a congressional cutoff in U.S.
military aid.
   Another document sought by the senators describes Reagan's
apparent approval of airdropping intelligence and rifles to the
Contras to destroy arms-bearing ships headed for Nicaragua. The
document, dated Oct. 30, 1985, also concerns reconnaissance
overflights of Nicaragua.
   Another document sought by Mitchell and Inouye spells out
Reagan's phone call to Honduran President Robert Suazo Cordova
which resulted in the release of a Contra-bound arms shipment the
Honduran military had seized.
   Mitchell and Inouye also asked for ``other documents related to
these matters.''
   Documents on Honduras which emerged at North's trial describe
how the Reagan administration conditioned extra aid to Honduras on
Contra support and the lengths to which the administration went to
keep such arrangements secret from Congress.
   An interagency Crisis Pre-Planning Group on Feb. 7, 1985,
approved an agreement under which Reagan would send a letter to the
Honduran president urging Contra support and offering several
inducements.
   The enticements included speeded-up deliveries of military
supplies, release of economic assistance and CIA support.
   Reagan's letter urging Contra support was to be followed by the
visit of an emissary who would orally outline the conditions
attached to the extra aid. The CPPG didn't want to include the
detail of the quid pro quo arrangement in writing.
   North and NSC staffer Raymond Burghardt subsequently became
concerned over how the plan was to be carried out.
   There was to be no special emissary conditioning the extra aid
on Contra support. Instead, U.S. Ambassador to Honduras John
Negroponte was to deliver the text of Reagan's letter and to take a
softer approach, saying that Reagan had directed extra assistance.
   ``To date, all administration officials have been able to state
to the Congress that we have not approached any other government to
support the resistance,'' North and NSC colleague Raymond Burghardt
said in a Feb. 20, 1985, memo. The memo to then-national security
adviser Robert McFarlane is one of the documents the two senators
want included in a review by Bush.
   If the State Department's approach is carried out, ``we will no
longer be able to make such a claim and any of the appropriate
committees may place a call for all relevant cables on this matter
at any time,'' said the memo.
   ``Amb Negroponte, who will be called upon to testify during his
confirmation hearings for assistant secretary, will undoubtedly be
queried on whether or not such overtures were made to the
Hondurans.''
   The North-Burghardt memo said that ``notwithstanding our own
interpretations'' of the Boland amendment cutting off military aid
to the Contras ``it is very clear from the colloquy during the
debate ... that the legislative intent was to deny any direct or
indirect support for the military-paramilitary operations in
Nicaragua.'' The amendment had gone into effect in October 1984.
   ``In short, the decision to proceed without an emissary places
both Amb Negroponte and our hopes with the Hill at increased
jeopardy. We still believe that our original concept of an emissary
is the proper way in which to proceed.''
   North and Burghardt apparently prevailed.
   North wrote a followup memo on Feb. 25, 1985, saying that
Reagan's signed letter urging Contra support ``will be delivered''
to Suazo by Burghardt.

   President Bush is exercising one prerogative
of being president: changing his mind.
   But when a president changes his mind, the ramifications can be
far-reaching and sometimes costly.
   For instance, Bush planned to spend last weekend at his vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   He was to make a four-day event of it, with education speeches
in Union, N.J., on the way up and in Rochester, N.Y., on the way
back.
   Bush delivered the speech in New Jersey on Thursday, but
scrubbed the long vacation weekend in Maine so he could be on hand
for Friday's unveiling of a budget compromise with congressional
leaders.
   Then he added a new destination for Monday, scrapping upstate
New York for Hamtramck, Mich., where he announced a package of
economic incentives for Poland.
   White House aides wanted a locale with a large Polish-American
population, and Rochester didn't quite fit the bill.
   Canceling the Kennebunkport trip meant dozens of reserved hotel
rooms _ obtained by White House aides, security agents and
reporters _ had to be ditched at the last minute, and a fleet of
five dozen rental cars returned.
   It also meant elaborate advance and security preparations in
Rochester, where Bush was to visit an Eastman Kodak plant and speak
at a school, went for naught.
   ``The White House goes where the president goes,'' said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Last month, a planned trip to California and other Western
states was scheduled, then postponed and finally canceled. Now, the
West Coast trip is on again _ but in modified form, for later this
month.
   In the meantime, another Kennebunkport trip scheduled for May
5-6 was scrapped. And, a presidential visit to Lockerbie, Scotland,
site of last December's Pan Am Flight 103 disaster, was penciled
onto the president's itinerary for his four-nation European trip in
May, then suddenly taken off.
   Bush flip-flops, of course, include more than trips.
   On semiautomatic assault rifles, Bush initially said he opposed
any attempts to control or restrict them. But he later moved to
suspend imports of these weapons.
   Then, he tightened that ban, angering congressional gun-control
opponents in the process, amid hints that the administration would
come out with permanent new restrictions on both domestic and
foreign-produced assault weapons.
   He admitted to ``a pulse change'' on the subject of gun control.
   Bush also did an about-face on federal involvement in cleanup
operations in the Alaska oil spill, first praising Exxon for the
job it was doing and voicing opposition to a federal takeover; then
moving a week later to put one in effect.
   Bush also executed a turnabout on U.S. funds for the Nicaraguan
Contras. First he echoed the Reagan administration position
favoring continuing military support for the anti-government
rebels. But he wound up going along with a bipartisan agreement
sharply scaling back U.S. support for the Contras.
   He also has seemed to come down on both sides of the issue of
tuition tax credits.
   When a student at a White House session on March 29 asked him if
the parents of a child in private school should get a federal tax
credit for the tuition they pay, he said, ``No, they shouldn't.''
   But he told a group of conservatives and evangelical Christians
this week that he supports the idea of tuition tax credits,
although budget constraints prevent him from proposing one at this
time.
   Bush's flips and shifts prompted Washington Post political
cartoonist Herblock to depict him as a gaunt figure atop a
weathervane, flopping one way then the other, a finger jutting up
to catch the shifting winds of public opinion.
   But Bush, after all, is the president. And there's no
prohibition against changing his mind, either on trips or on issues.
   And kinder and gentler only goes so far. ``If you're too polite
in life, you get stomped on,'' Bush told a youngster who was
hesitant in raising her hand at a question-and-answer session at
the White House.

   Rain, lightning and 125 years have taken such
a toll on the giant bronze Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol dome
that it will be removed _ probably by helicopter _ and restored,
the Capitol architect says.
   The operation will leave a large hole in the top of the lantern
which supports the statue on top of the dome. The hole will be
fitted with a temporary cover to keep out rain during the six-month
long, $250,000 restoration project, according to Architect George
White.
   But White said the iron dome itself is in excellent condition
and needs no major repairs.
   The 14,985-pound figure which rises 19 feet six inches from the
top of the soaring dome is a symbolic cast-bronze image of a female
warrior draped in flowing robes and clasping a sheathed sword.
   It has been a Capitol symbol since its head, the last of five
sections, was hoisted aloft and bolted in place on Dec. 2, 1863.
   ``It hasn't been touched since that time,'' White said. ``When
we had the dome repainted last summer we confirmed that the statue
is in very serious condition.''
   White said cracks had developed in some of the interior
fastenings of the statue and that an exterior chunk of its robes
fell out last year. The statue consists of five separate pieces of
cast bronze bolted together and attached to a cast-iron base.
   ``The whole thing is in really bad condition,'' White said.
``Bronze does deteriorate.''
   In preparation for removing the statue a protective cage will be
built around it, White said and added: ``We'll probably take it
down by helicopter.''
   The project could begin soon although no firm date has been set.
   The statue is the finishing flourish of the soaring dome which
was completed during the middle of the Civil War. Although the iron
of which it is crafted could have been used for the war effort,
President Lincoln ordered work on the dome to continue as a symbol
that the national union of states was also continuing.
   Many of the 15 million tourists who see the statue from a
distance mistakenly believe it depicts an American Indian because
of its elaborate headdress.
   Actually, the statue's head is covered by a helmet circled with
stars and topped with a crest composed of an eagle's head and
decorative feathers.
   White disclosed the renovation project at a ceremony launching a
multimillion-dollar fund-raising effort seeking private donations
for restoration work at the Capitol and to create a fund to buy art
works associated with its past.
   In another project, the parking lot which has covered the
Capitol's East Plaza since the beginning of the automotive age will
be closed and the space filled with decorative stone paving.
   Two marble fountains, carved during Lady Bird Johnson's
beautification campaign in the late 1960s but never installed
because of a lack of funds, will be placed in the center of the
plaza.
   The newly created U.S. Capitol Preservation Commission will
coordinate the fund raising and restoration under the direction of
Former Postmaster General Preston Tisch.
   Tisch said the aim of the new organization will be similar to
that of the foundations created to refurbish Blair House, the
president's guest house, and to acquire historic objects for the
White House and the State Department's reception rooms.
   The commission also will receive half the profits from the sale
of special coins to be issued later in the year to commemorate the
bicentennial of Congress.
   Tisch said the first fund-raising effort will be a bicentennial
banquet on June 20, which is intended to raise at least $1.5
million.

<HEAD>Government Intensifies 1985-1986 Fiero Fires Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Nearly 150,000 Pontiac Fieros may be in danger
of catching fire from oil that escapes if owners fail to keep the
crankcase filled, according to complaints that prompted an
intensification of a federal safety probe.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday
it had upgraded a preliminary evaluation of the General Motors
Corp. cars to an engineering analysis. Investigations are typically
raised to the higher level when engineers see reason to believe
there might be a safety problem with vehicles.
   GM in 1987 agreed to recall 126,000 1984-model Fieros after
similar reports of fires, NHTSA said. The 1985 and 1986 Fieros had
the same oil-system design as did the 1984 models, said David
Hudgens, a GM spokesman in Detroit.
   According to the complaints, driving the Fieros with low oil
levels can cause a connecting rod to break.
   Oil escaping from the resulting hole ``would catch on fire when
it contacted the exhaust manifold or hot exhaust components,'' the
agency's engineers said in summarizing the alleged defect.
   The agency said it has received 148 complaints regarding the
Fieros, including reports of six injuries.
   The engineering analysis affects 147,571 1985 and 1986 Fieros,
NHTSA said.
   Hudgens said failure of drivers to maintain their cars properly
may be part of the problem.
   ``If you ran out of oil, and then that coupled with some
aggressive driving perhaps and maybe not changing the oil very
often, you end up with a broken rod, and that's where the
connecting rod came in,'' Hudgens said. ``It is still the owner's
responsibility to check the oil.''
   The Fiero went out of production in 1988 in what was ``strictly
a marketing decision,'' Hudgens said.
   NHTSA also opened a new preliminary evaluation into unconfirmed
reports of power-steering loss in GM's 1987 A-body cars with
4-cylinder engines.
   The A-body cars are the Buick Century, Chevrolet Celebrity,
Oldsmobile Ciera and Pontiac 6000.
   NHTSA said it had received nine complaints, including one
accident with an injury, of fluid leaking from the power-steering
pressure hose, which resulted in a sudden loss of steering
assistance.
   That investigation involves 527,459 cars, NHTSA said.
   Nine other preliminary evaluations were opened by the agency
into:
   _Erratic cruise control in about 10,000 1987 Chrysler Jeep
Cherokees.
   _Windshield wiper failure in 300,000 1988-model GM Corsica and
Beretta vehicles.
   _Erratic cruise control in 1988 GM Suburban and Jimmy vehicles
with 5.7 liter or 7.4 liter engines.
   _Excessive windshield fogging in 115,000 1986 Hyundai Excel GL
vehicles.
   _Gasoline splashing from the filler pipe due to alleged faulty
venting in 180,000 1988 Ford Town Cars.
   _Rear-brake jamming due to a faulty retaining ring in 900,000
1986-1987 GM Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville.
   _Jamming of the steering mechanism in 800,000 1985 and 1986 GM
G-body cars. The models using the now discontinued G-body were the
Chevrolet Monte Carlo and El Camino, Pontiac Grand Prix and
Bonneville, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Brougham, and Buick
Regal.
   _Rear-axle seal failure in 576,000 1985 through 1988 GM Astro
and Safari vehicles.
   NHTSA also raised two preliminary evaluations to the engineering
analysis level. They involved jamming of the front-seat lap belt in
394,500 1987-1988 Toyota Camry vehicles, and windshield-wiper
failure in 465,500 1986 through 1988 Ford Aerostar Minivans.
   The agency closed three investigations, finding there was ``no
defect trend.'' The investigations were into complaints of:
   _Tail-light wiring fires in 1987-1988 Chrysler Omnis.
   _Air-brake emergency valve defects in the Navistar 1988 S-series
school bus.
   _Engine surge in 1983-1986 Ford cars with 3.8-liter and 5-liter
fuel-injected engines.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush Has to Give First On Minimum Wage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats leading the effort to raise the
minimum wage say they are willing to make concessions but only if
President Bush does the same.
   ``Nothing is concrete,'' Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., said
Tuesday. ``Just about every provision in this is negotiable.''
   But Murphy and other lawmakers on a conference committee to
resolve differences between House- and Senate-passed minimum wage
bills said they will not offer any concessions unless Bush drops
his repeated veto threats and first offers a compromise of his own.
   The prospects for such a development appear slim. Knowing that,
the Democrats intensified their efforts to portray Bush as turning
his back on the working poor, a pitch that itself is part of an
effort by the Democrats to make political hay of any Bush veto of
minimum wage legislation.
   ``We will send you this bill and we will send you another bill,
and we will make you wish that you didn't have the power to veto,''
said Murphy. ``We're asking for some leadership, not the threat of
a veto.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., questioned the motives of
Bush's refusal to negotiate by pointing to a number of recent
agreements between Congress and the White House on issues ranging
from Contra aid to the savings and loan crisis.
   ``Why not on the minimum wage?'' Kennedy said. ``To millions of
low-income Americans the answer must seem obvious: the
administration doesn't care enough about them to listen to their
position. Kinder and gentler does not mean you.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell compared Bush's stance on
the minimum wage with his proposal to expand capital gains tax
breaks that would be enjoyed predominantly by wealthy Americans.
   ``The president ought to have as much concern for the poor as he
does for the rich,'' Mitchell said.
   The conferees said they hope to have a final product in about
two weeks and indicated it would be stripped of a number of Senate
amendments unrelated to the minimum wage, including one that would
raise the outside earnings limit for Social Security recipients.
   Bush has repeatedly said the only minimum wage bill he will
accept is his own, an offer to raise the minimum from its current
level of $3.35 an hour to $4.25 by January 1992, provided employers
can pay all new workers less than the minimum for up to six months.
   Both the House and Senate measures would raise the minimum wage
to $4.55 by October 1991 and allow a ``sub-minimum'' to be paid to
some newly hired workers for just two months.
   Murphy said that if no compromise is reached, he is considering
a number of other approaches to raising the minimum wage, including
a simple one-year increase of the base wage instead of the
incremental boosts contained in the current measures.

<HEAD>Philippine Vice President Says Marcos Should Be Allowed to Die at
Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel, who
met recently with Ferdinand Marcos at his sickbed, says the exiled
former president should be allowed to leave Hawaii and return home
to die.
   ``I think he should be allowed to return _ not only to die in
his own country, but to face whatever charges will be filed against
him. Let the Philippine people decide the case,'' Laurel said
Tuesday in an interview.
   The vice president, who has broken politically with President
Corazon Aquino, was meeting this week with several members of
Congress during a private visit to the United States. He was
scheduled to deliver an address today before the Center for
Democracy, a private research group.
   Laurel's position is in direct opposition to Mrs. Aquino's.
   The mere idea that the former dictator might return to the
homeland he ruled for 20 years is an extremely sensitive national
question. Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly rejected Marcos' requests,
citing security concerns.
   But the vice president dismissed the idea that Marcos' return to
his homeland _ dead or alive _ would spark unrest.
   ``I don't buy that. I think they are overrating Marcos,'' Laurel
said. ``I don't think his return would cause that kind of
destabilization.''
   The vice president's trip to Marcos' bedside in February was the
subject of some speculation in the Philippines that he was looking
for support from Marcos supporters as he began to work with an
opposition party in advance of the 1992 elections.
   As a former opponent of the Marcos regime, Laurel said he was
surprised to receive the invitation from Imelda Marcos to go to
Hawaii. He said he returned to the Philippines with a message for
Mrs. Aquino from the dying former president, but Mrs. Aquino
refused to see him.
   Laurel said his interest was ``national reconciliation.'' He
said Marcos' message, which he would not reveal, did not involve a
``deal'' but ``was something that might straighten out things.''
   Marcos has been hospitalized in Honolulu since Jan. 16,
suffering from bronchial asthma and pneumonia. In December, he was
hospitalized twice with congestive heart failure.
   Marcos was ousted in 1986 in a popular uprising that later swept
Mrs. Aquino and her running mate, Laurel, into office.
   In September 1987, Laurel resigned as foreign secretary, citing
widespread differences with Mrs. Aquino on the 20-year battle
against a communist insurgency and other issues such as the
country's economic development.
   The Marcoses are under indictment in New York on racketeering
charges. The couple would need permission from the U.S. attorney
general and the U.S. District Court in New York to leave the United
States.
   The indictment accuses the ousted Philippines dictator and his
wife of stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine
treasury to buy real estate and expensive art objects in New York.
   Overall, the Philippines says the couple took $3.5 billion in
cash and property.
   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in the
U.S. indictment. Marcos has said he is too ill to appear in New
York for legal proceedings.
   Laurel argued that as a man who is charged with looting the
Philippines, Marcos should face charges there first.
   ``The Philippines has a prior claim over the United States. ...
It may be that the U.S. has a valid case against him ... but
offenses committed against the Filipino people should be decided by
the Philippine courts,'' Laurel said.

   In a cost-cutting move, the Soviets are bringing
their cosmonauts home from their space station Mir next week and
leaving it unmanned until August, the station's deputy flight
director says.
   Viktor D. Blagov said no technical problems had cropped up in
the 3-year-old orbiting complex that is the showcase of the Soviet
space program.
   His comments Tuesday came a day after the magazine Aviation Week
and Space Technology reported in the United States that Mir had
developed a serious electrical power problem.
   Mir's solar batteries, Blagov said, were experiencing some power
loss but that it was within expected levels and was not causing any
problem.
   Blagov said plans to keep Soviets aboard the station
continuously were abandoned for several reasons.
   ``By this action, we are of course economizing some sum which
can be used for other purposes,'' he said by telephone from the
Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad, north of Moscow.
   He did not identify the other purposes, but the public has
called for the untold millions of rubles spent on space to be
diverted toward ending chronic shortages of consumer goods and food.
   Blagov said Soviet scientists were swamped analyzing information
gathered from Mir, which was launched Feb. 20, 1986. They now must
pause to review ``what we have accomplished and decide what's
next.''
   Tentative plans call for a module the same size as Mir to be
attached to the station at year's end, and until then there is no
need for a crew, Blagov said. A launching of a replacement crew
originally scheduled for today has been canceled.
   Cosmonauts Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov
are to mothball the Mir and return to Earth on April 27. A new crew
will be sent up in mid-August to prepare for the attaching the new
module, Blagov said.
   The attachment contains a space bicycle for cosmonauts, a solar
battery to supplement that of the Mir, an East German optical
experiment and an airlock through which cosmonauts can pass to take
spacewalks.
   One module, a space laboratory, was attached to Mir in April
1987 and three others are planned, including one to be put up at
the end of this year or early next year in which crystals will be
grown for semiconductors, electronic parts used in computers and
other devices, Blagov said.
   One reason for putting Mir on automatic mode is to give a rest
to its support staff at mission control and tracking stations that
have been working continuously for three years, Blagov said.
   ``People are tired. They haven't had vacations. We owe them
this,'' he said.
   Officials have said a ground controller sent an erroneous
command to an unmanned Mars probe, Phobos I, in September, leaving
it useless. A sister ship, Phobos II, was lost for still
undetermined reasons last month.
   Blagov said Mir uses different controllers than those who worked
on Phobos, but indicated all are susceptible to fatigue.
   ``Tiredness can lead to an increase in mistakes, and a break
gives a positive effect to a person's work,'' Blagov said.
   During the three-month break, he said, scientists will continue
to gather data from automatic Mir instruments studying a supernova,
photographing the ocean shelf and monitoring meteorites.
   Engineers are boosting the Mir to a higher orbit to keep its
orbit from decaying, Blagov said.
   In 1974, the vacant American Skylab 4 space station fell into
the Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated upon re-entry.

   Environmentalists are gearing up for an
international ``Earth Day 1990'' that they hope will dwarf the
original of 20 years ago, an event that helped make U.S. laws more
sensitive to environmental concerns.
   ``The purpose of Earth Day in 1970 was to organize a nationwide
grassroots demonstration of public concern for the environment,''
former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, who founded the event, said Tuesday.
``Though much has been achieved in many areas in the past 20 years,
we continue to lose ground in the fight to improve our
environment.''
   Denis Hayes, coordinator of the first Earth Day, and Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass. and Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y, who were local Earth Day
activists 20 years ago, joined Nelson at a news conference to
announce plans for the April 22, 1990, event.
   Nelson, who now is counselor to the Wilderness Society, called
on President Bush to lead other heads of state into a ``battle to
save the Earth.''
   Hayes said the observance is meant to start a decade of
environmental concern showing that countries throughout the world
have a ``shared set of values and commitment to save the planet.''
   He said that organizers have talked to members of the White
House staff, but have not yet approached Bush directly.
   Nelson said no president campaigns against environmental
policies, but none since Theodore Roosevelt has understood what
needs to be done. Leaders of other nations have been similarly
shortsighted, he said.
   ``In the leading industrial nations Prime Minister Thatcher and
President Mitterand have joined President Bush in paying lip
service to global environmental problems,'' Nelson said. ``None has
yet said anything important about their plans for resolving these
problems or made any serious proposals for addressing them.''
   Green said the United States has adopted laws to begin cleanup,
but isn't keeping up with the problems.
   ``Of 1,200 major hazardous waste sites, just 34 have been
cleaned up,'' he said. ``And while Congress in 1980 allocated $1.6
billion to help clean up such sites, estimates of the federal share
now range up to $300 billion.''

<HEAD>Official Ceremony Honors Massacre Victims But Does Not Assign Guilt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official ceremony honored the more than
4,300 Polish officers killed in the World War II Katyn massacre and
a new inscription didn't blame either the Nazis or the Soviets for
the atrocity.
   Instead, the tablet that was unveiled Tuesday at Warsaw's
Powazki Cemetery said only: ``To Polish officers killed in Katyn.''
The previous inscription blamed ``Hitlerite fascists.''
   Polish generals speaking at the ceremony indicated the issue of
determining guilt for the massacre _ a highly emotional issue in
Polish-Soviet relations _ has not yet been resolved to Poland's
satisfaction.
   After the ceremony ended, some people among the several thousand
spectators placed a sign on the granite memorial reading: ``Soviet
murder.''
   Up until this year, Poland's Communist governments officially
accepted Soviet claims that the Polish officers shot at Katyn, near
the Soviet city of Smolensk, and buried in mass graves were killed
by the Nazis after Germany invaded Russia in 1941.
   Western historians have concluded that the massacre was
committed by Soviet secret police on Josef Stalin's order in 1940.
   The officers, the cream of Polish society called up from the
reserves, were among about 15,000 interned by the Soviets when they
occupied eastern Poland in 1939. The fate of the other 11,000 is
not known.
   Polish members of a joint Polish-Soviet commission investigating
the massacre say they have tentatively concluded that the Soviets
were to blame, but the Soviets have not acknowledged that account.
   Speakers at the ceremony did not speak of Soviet culpability but
made it clear the issue remains open.
   ``This event indicates a victory of new thinking in Poland,''
said Gen. Roman Paszkowski, who led the official delegation.
``Although you know your husbands and sons are not alive, please
remember they will stay forever in our hearts and minds.''
   Gen. Franciszek Skibinski said: ``It is not possible to change
the course of history, but it is necessary to reveal the whole
truth. I hope the Polish-Soviet commission will soon complete its
work and the whole truth will be made public.''
   During the ceremony an urn of soil from the graves of the
massacred officers was embedded in the monument.
   An official delegation that included relatives of the victims
had gone to Katyn and brought back two urns. On Tuesday, one urn
was brought to the cemetery and the other placed at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
   Soldiers lined the cemetery walkways and an honor guard of boy
scouts stood at the flower-covered memorial.
   A woman whose husband and brother-in-law were killed at Katyn
said she expected ``the whole truth will come out now.''

<HEAD>Court Asked to Rule on High Liability Awards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's second-largest waste hauler is
asking the Supreme Court to reverse a $6 million jury verdict
against it as an example of ``bloated, irrational and excessive
awards'' in liability lawsuits.
   In a case that businesses say could have an enormous impact on
their insurance costs and the overall competitiveness of American
industry, Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. argued Tuesday against
what it called huge punitive damage awards.
   BFI attorney Andrew L. Frey told the high court that enormous
punitive damage awards violate the Constitution's Eighth Amendment
prohibition against excessive fines, as well as due process rights
and common law.
   The case centers on a lawsuit brought by Kelco Disposal Inc. of
Burlington, Vt., againt Houston-based BFI, accusing the Texas
company of predatory pricing to drive Kelco out of business.
   A Vermont jury awarded Kelco $51,146 in compensatory damages, in
contrast to the much larger punitive total.
   Kelco lawyer H. Bartow Farr III argued the Eighth Amendment's
prohibition against excessive fines does not apply to punitive
damages ``awarded in a private state court tort action,'' and
applying it would be ``intrusive second-guessing'' of jury verdicts.
   Farr said state laws provide for punitive-damage awards to be
reviewed by the courts, and such awards are ``routinely reduced.''
   ``The courts below upheld this award under traditional common
law standards,'' Farr said. ``Damages are simply not fines.''
   Dozens of ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs were filed as
manufacturers, publishers, insurers, broadcasters, pharmacists, the
Red Cross, defense attorneys and U.S. Chamber of Commerce officials
all urged the justices to place some limits on punitive damages.
   They say unfettered jury decisions allowing huge penalty awards
are driving up insurance rates and discouraging the marketing of
products from medical equipment to football helmets.
   Trial attorneys and consumer groups, who argue punitive damages
are the best protection against bad business practices, have sided
with Kelco, which survived BFI's price cutting and in 1985 forced
the larger company out of town.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor questioned whether ruling for BFI would force the court to
review all future punitive-damage awards that someone considered
excessive.
   Frey said that applying the excessive-fines provision in such
civil cases would sharply curb a growing trend toward excessive
awards that has prompted ``tort reform'' by state legislatures.
   Justice Antonin Scalia insisted Frey was seeking a national
standard that all 50 states would have to follow, rather than
allowing each state to set its own punitive-damage limits.
   The court is expected to announce its decision by July.
   The case is Browning-Ferris Industries of Vermont Inc. vs. Kelco
Disposal Inc., 88-556.

<HEAD>House Committee Passes $4.7 Billion Measure, Bush Threatens Veto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1990 budget plan reflecting the deal reached
between the White House and Congress is working its way through the
Senate Budget Committee, but a separate $4.7 billion spending bill
for this year is ruffling Republican feathers.
   The Senate Budget Committee began debating the fiscal 1990
budget resolution on Tuesday and hoped to finish its work today.
   On Tuesday, it voted 19-4 to reject an amendment by Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., to institute deep across-the-board
spending cuts in place of the compromise reached last week.
   Johnston, complaining that the bipartisan pact ``does not cut
the budget at all,'' said his plan would sent a message ``to start
all over again, to do a real job of budgeting.''
   Joining Johnston was Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., who said, ``If
anyone thinks Rosemary's Baby was ugly, I suggest taking a close
look at this newly hatched baby.''
   Administration officials and congressional leaders ended a month
of negotiations last Friday by announcing a deal for $1.2 trillion
budget that claims a deficit of $99.4 billion.
   The budget committee is charged with producing a congressional
resolution that will guide later spending and tax bills for fiscal
1990, which begins Oct. 1. Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said he
would oppose any plan that did not follow the White House pact.
   But trouble was brewing across Capitol Hill on a so-called dire
emergency spending bill for this year.
   The House Appropriations Committee approved a $4.7 billion
supplemental spending bill for fiscal 1989, a measure that if
approved could put Congress on a collision course with President
Bush.
   On a unanimous voice vote, the House appropriations panel sent
the wide-ranging spending bill to the House floor.
   But first, in a party-line 28-18 vote, the committee's majority
Democrats rejected a Republican effort that would have shaved about
$1.5 billion in new spending from the measure.
   ``The worst thing we could do here is report a bill perceived to
be fiscally irresponsible and a budget buster,'' said Rep. Silvio
Conte, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the appropriations panel.
   The Bush administration renewed its threat to veto the so-called
``dire emergency'' bill, stating in a letter that the president
favored the less expensive GOP alternative.
   ``In my view, fiscal responsibility requires that we go no
further,'' administration budget director Richard Darman wrote to
Conte.
   Last month, Bush had asked Congress to approve a $2.2 billion
version of the measure. The committee more than doubled its size.
   As passed by the committee, the bill provides $1.2 billion for
veterans programs, $892 million for the Guaranteed Student Loan
program for college students, $822 million for drug efforts, $600
million to fight last summer's forest fires, $423 million for
foster care and adoption programs, and $100 million to pay for the
costs of immigration increases from the Soviet Union, Southeast
Asia and Africa.
   The measure also contains $127 million for workers whose jobs
are lost due to foreign competition; $71 million for the Federal
Aviation Administration to hire more air traffic controllers,
inspectors and security officers; and $35 million to prosecute
fraud cases involving the financially reeling savings and loan
industry.
   Amendments Tuesday added $153 million for programs for the
homeless; $88 million to help subsidize public housing projects;
and $200,000 to provide aid to Poland for upcoming elections.
   One provision would prohibit the Interior Department from
spending money to make the Chicago home of mobster Al Capone a
historic site.
   With the 1989 deficit already projected at more than $163
billion, the spending measure would push the government's shortfall
$1.3 billion deeper, the White House's Office of Management and
Budget said. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, this
year's deficit was not supposed to exceed $146 billion.
   Because the deficit figures reflect overall outlays, the bill's
impact on the deficit is different from the spending authorized in
the bill.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Law Giving Contras $50 Million; Rights Violation Investigated</HEAD>

   President Bush signed into law a bipartisan
plan to give the Contras non-military aid, even as State Department
officials looked into human rights allegations that could block the
$49.8 million package.
   The administration was trying to determine the veracity of a
report Tuesday in The Washington Post that the Nicaraguan rebels
failed to expel a commander who was convicted of covering up a
murder. The story said the rebels ignored a warning by a top State
Department official that they were required to take such action in
order to remain eligible for the new U.S. aid.
   The new aid, the product of a March 24 bipartisan agreement
between the administration and Congress, calls for cutoff of the
money if there are human rights abuses by the Contras.
   The State Department said the Contras' own military tribunal on
March 23 expelled six Contra members for human rights violations,
including the rebels' head of intelligence, known as Commandante
Mack.
   But The Post, citing rebel sources, reported that Mack was still
working at Contra headquarters despite his conviction and expulsion.
   ``His attendance at any official resistance function would be
forbidden under the expulsion order,'' said a State Department
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official said that Commandante Mack and a regional commander
known as Commandante Nolan both had appealed their convictions to
the Contra directorate.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Chris Arcos confirmed
Tuesday that he had made clear to the rebels during a meeting
within the last three weeks that they were expected to remove the
violaters from their ranks.
   ``Legally we would have the basis,'' to halt the aid if they did
not, Arcos said. He said the admininistration was trying to find
out if the newspaper report were true.
   He said the Contra military tribunal last month had convicted a
commander with the nom de guerre Commandante Mack, but that the
leader was seen in the Contra camps subsequent to the time he
should have been expelled.
   Arcos said that he was ``reassured'' then by the Contra
leadership that they did intend to expel anyone convicted of human
rights abuses, and now he was trying to find out if that had
occurred with Commandante Mack.
   Bush signed the legislation on Tuesday that will provide $49.8
million in non-military aid to sustain the rebels until Nicaragua
holds elections early next year. The legislation was hammered out
after two months of negotiation between administration officials
and congressional leaders.
   Bush restated his backing for a diplomatic solution in Nicaragua
after years of a pro-military policy advanced by President Reagan.
   Bush also repeated his call for the Soviet Union to help bring
peace to the region by ending its military aid to Nicaragua's
leftist government.
   ``The Soviet Union must match its rhetorical support for the
peace process with concrete action to halt military aid, to end
subversion in that region and to promote genuine democracy in
Nicaragua,'' Bush said Monday.
   In brief remarks in a Rose Garden signing ceremony, Bush was
flanked by Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and
Senate.
   He said that prospects for peace ``depend on full and honest
Sandinista compliance with their repeated pledges of democracy and
freedom.''
   ``It's clear that close international scrutiny and sustained
pressure will be critical to induce Sandinista compliance,'' he
said.
   The package calls for non-lethal aid to the rebels until the
Nicaraguan elections scheduled for next February.
   The money, administered through the State Department's Agency
for International Development, also can be used to repatriate the
Contras.
   The package also includes $4.2 million, to be administered by
the Roman Catholic Church in Nicaragua, in medical assistance for
civilian victims of the civil war.
   The Contras, whose numbers are estimated at 11,000, are encamped
along the Honduran border.

<HEAD>Smithsonian TV Exhibit Draws Original `Lassie' Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jon Provost, child star of the ``Lassie''
television show of three decades ago, will soon start filming a new
version of the long-popular TV series for broadcast next fall,
playing an uncle of the dog's young masters.
   Now 39 and a real estate agent in Santa Rosa, Calif., Provost
was a surprise visitor at the preview Tuesday of a new exhibition
celebrating 50 years of American television. The yearlong show
opens today at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
American History.
   Touring the exhibit of 200 artifacts and more than 100
photographs tracing the history of U.S. television, Provost paused
for a nostalgic look at the costume he wore as Timmy in the
original ``Lassie'' series.
   Provost had made a gift to the Smithsonian of the red-checkered
sports shirt, blue jeans and black-topped tennis shoes he wore on
the show from 1957 until 1964. The actor was 7 years old when he
began filming the series, and quit the show when he was 14.
   ``It really was a thrill to be asked to donate them to the
Smithsonian,'' he said.
   Provost said he will play an uncle on the new syndicated
``Lassie'' show, which will star Dee Wallace Stone and her
real-life husband, Christopher Stone, as the parents. The new TV
family's pet collie will be the eighth generation descendant of the
original Lassie, he said.
   Last week, during preliminary filming in Los Angeles with the
full cast, Provost said ``it really brought back memories'' to make
friends with the new Lassie. ``We definitely will be building a
relationship, I think,'' he said.
   The museum exhibit, underwritten by the consumer electronics
group of the Electronic Industries Association, traces the history
of American television from its inauguration at the New York
World's Fair in April 1939.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt's speech at the opening
ceremonies was broadcast to about 200 TV receivers in metropolitan
New York, marking the start of regular television service in the
United States.
   Highlights of the show include the RCA television receiver,
encased in Lucite, which was displayed at the World's Fair and
other early TV sets.
   Memorabilia on display include Archie Bunker's wing chair from
``All In The Family,'' the pith helmet worn by Marlin Perkins, host
of the ``Wild Kingdom'' show, J.R. Ewing's cowboy hat from
``Dallas,'' the Howdy Doody marionette, the leather jacket that
Henry Winkler wore as the Fonz on ``Happy Days'' and a stainless
steel coffee pot used on the soap opera, ``The Guiding Light.''
   At the preview Tuesday, museum director Roger G. Kennedy said
the exhibition seeks to illustrate the dramatic growth of
television's influence on American society since World War II.
   ``Aside from instruments of mass destruction,'' he said,
``television is probably the most significant lever of change in
the American psyche in the past two generations.''

<HEAD>Coalition Fights to Keep Syndication Rules Intact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of television producers, unions
and station owners says it will fight any attempt by ABC, CBS and
NBC to re-enter and dominate the lucrative syndicated TV market the
networks were forced to leave in 1983.
   The Motion Picture Association of America on Tuesday announced
that a 207-member coalition would stand in the way of the networks
if they attempt to ``gut'' the so-called financial interest and
syndication rule.
   MPAA President Jack Valenti said the coalition was putting the
networks on notice that ``we will not lag or hesitate to defend the
rule and hold it in place.''
   A 1983 consent decree between the networks and the Justice
Department forced the networks out of the syndication business.
That agreement expires in 1990, and the networks and producers have
been negotiating to try to reach a new accord without further
government intervention.
   But the talks have reached an impasse, the Coalition to Preserve
the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules said.
   Independent producers say they owe their very existences to the
1983 decree, under which the networks were allowed to keep the
programs they broadcast for four years and then return them to
producers for sale to independent TV stations and network
affiliates.
   Hit programs such as ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Miami Vice'' can
make many millions of dollars in this syndication market.
   Unlike before, the networks were barred from holding any
financial interest in programs they license from outside producers.
But the networks take all advertising revenues from a program's
network run.
   The program producers, on the other hand, are paid a licensing
fee by the networks _ typically $1 million to $1.5 million for an
hourlong program _ that usually doesn't meet the total costs of the
production.
   But the producers can profit enormously in syndication with a
hit show.
   ``The rule is working,'' the coalition said. ``The number of
independent TV stations has grown; so has the number and quality of
producers creating programming for network and syndicated
exhibition. ... Meanwhile, the three major networks remain
profitable and dominant.''
   An NBC spokesman in New York, Joe Rutledge, said the rules,
which first were adopted by the Federal Communications Commission
in 1970, have ``had exactly the opposite effect from what was
intended.''
   He said the FCC in 1983 recommended the rules be repealed
because the rules ``had concentrated power in the hands of a small
number of studios rather than adding to diversity.''
   Jay Kriegel, senior vice president at CBS in New York, said he
hoped the addition of independent producers to the studio-network
negotiations ``will be good for the talks.''
   He said the Hollywood studios, who are in the present coalition,
were trying to consolidate their gains against the networks in
numerous areas. ``Half the MPAA members are in direct competition
with the networks,'' Kriegel said. ``Every leader in that community
is now going into our business very aggressively.''
   The coalition includes the MPAA, the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers, the Association of Independent Television
Stations, the Communications Workers of America, the Directors
Guild of America, General Mills, the International Alliance of
Theatrical Stage Employees, the Screen Actors Guild and the
Consumer Federation of America.

<HEAD>Cheney Takes First Overseas Trip as Defense Secretary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush was presented a wide
range of options for modernizing America's nuclear arsenal and
pursuing Star Wars research, but made no immediate decisions,
according to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The Pentagon chief, who arrived here this morning for his first
NATO meeting since assuming office, told reporters he didn't expect
to learn of Bush's decisions on those two critical issues until the
end of the week.
   Cheney said some of his own decisions about where to cut the
Pentagon's fiscal 1990 budget would depend on what the president
decided.
   Bush is grappling with whether he can afford the type of
financial commitment to Star Wars made by former President Ronald
Reagan, and with whether the United States should build a small
mobile nuclear missile or place the giant MX missile on rail car
launchers.
   Congressional and administration leaders agree the United States
needs a mobile missile to better deter a Soviet attack, but not on
which missile is best.
   Cheney, appearing relaxed on his Air Force jet as he embarked on
what he called his ``maiden voyage'' to NATO, refused Tuesday to
discuss his own recommendations to Bush.
   But the Washington Post reported today that Cheney told Bush he
favors building a railroad-based version of the MX nuclear missile
and scrapping the planned Midgetman missile.
   Both weapons are designed as successors to the Minuteman, which
has formed the heart of the nation's land-based atomic missile
force for two decades. The Pentagon has built 50 MX weapons for
deployment in silos in Nebraska and Wyoming.
   If Cheney favors the rail-based MX over the Midgetman, he would
be taking the position long favored by the Air Force. The Midgetman
has chiefly been supported by Democrats, who control Congress.
   But the defense secretary acknowledged there were still sharp
divisions within the administration on how best to proceed and that
Bush had received ``a wide range of opinions'' during a closed-door
National Security Council meeting at the White House Tuesday.
   ``Obviously, there are strongly held views within the
administration on these questions,'' Cheney said. ``And there are
different views within the administration on these questions.''
   While Bush is still debating nuclee Pentagon's original 1990
budget proposal by $10 billion.
   Bush and congressional Democrats agreed last week on that cut,
which will force the Pentagon to settle for a budget that fails to
match the inflation rate. The new total for military spending is
$305.5 billion.
   While Cheney declined to discuss any of his specific budget
decisions, an aide who demanded anonymity said the defense chief
planned to kill the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey aircraft program and
force the Navy to accept a cut in its aircraft carrier fleet.
   The V-22 is a high-tech ``hybrid'' aircraft that can take off
like a helicopter and fly like an airplane, thanks to engines that
swivel at the ends of its wings.
   At a cost of more than $20 million per plane, however, ``Cheney
has a hard time accepting this as a cost-effective way to carry 20
Marines into combat,'' the aide said.
   As for the NATO meeting, Cheney said it was important that the
alliance proceed with modernizing its Lance short-range nuclear
missiles, now that all intermediate-range missiles had been
abolished by treaty with the Soviet Union.
   But the defense secretary added he expected no final decisions
at this week's meeting on the timetable for replacing the Lance.
   West Germany has expressed reservations about the issue,
dividing the alliance by suggesting further arms-control talks with
the Soviet Union might obviate the need for modernizing the Lance.
The issue is particularly sensitive in West Germany, since most
short-range nuclear missiles are deployed there and would be used
there in the event of war.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Pushes For Fat and Cholesterol Labeling To Fight Heart Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., has proposed
requiring that food products include easily understood details of
fat and cholesterol content to help consumers reduce their chances
of heart disease.
   ``You could starve to death in the supermarket just reading the
labels,'' complained the 61-year-old lawmaker.
   Under the measure, the Food and Drug Administration would
require food manufacturers to list the different types of fat _
saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated _ and their amounts.
Federal regulations now require food producers to list only the
total fat content.
   The ninth-term Boston Democrat said the current labeling
provision ``is particularly disturbing since some fats increase
blood cholesterol and other types of fat actually lower one's
cholesterol.''
   The bill also would require food manufacturers to specify
amounts of dietary cholesterol, which also has been linked to heart
disease. There currently is no cholesterol labeling requirement.

   The Tax Court has turned thumbs down on a
Minnesota undertaker who took a business tax deduction for $11,000
of expenses of wedding receptions for two daughters.
   William L. McReavy of Minneapolis and his wife, Kathleen,
claimed the receptions as an advertising-entertainment expense,
contending that 82 percent of the people invited were clients or
referral sources for his Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels, Inc.
   ``The personal element of the expenses for the McReavys'
daughters' weddings was so prominent that we believe that even a
person not versed in the tax law would know that the corporation
could not deduct them,'' the court held on Tuesday.
   The court was so unimpressed by the argument that it allowed the
Internal Revenue Service to add a negligence penalty to the
McReavys' bill.

   A group of House Republicans are hoping to
repeal parts of the new catastrophic health expansion of Medicare _
mainly the income tax surcharge imposed on the well-to-do elderly
to help finance the program.
   The proposal, unveiled at a news conference Tuesday, would keep
most major benefits of the program, but revamp a prescription drug
benefit and make its more generous provisions apply only to
low-income Medicare beneficiaries not poor enough to qualify for
Medicaid.
   The law passed by overwhelming margins in both the House and
Senate last year _ despite vocal opposition from opponents of the
surcharge _ and was signed into law by then-President Reagan with
great fanfare.
   The surcharge has provoked a barrage of letters to lawmakers
even though it does not apply to 60 percent of all 32 million
Medicare beneficiaries who do not have enough income to pay federal
taxes.
   Of the 40 percent subject to the surcharge, only those couples
with annual incomes of $100,000 or so would be subject to the
maximum surcharge of $800 a person.
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, D-Fla., a lead sponsor of the
legislation, acknowledged that many of his own constituents who
have complained mistakenly believe they will be subject to an
income tax surcharge.

   The Bush administration says it wants to
preserve the right to control entry to the United States of anyone
who ever was a Communist.
   The stance was spelled out in a letter to Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass, who has led a six-year fight to change the current law and
limit the power of the government to keep out visitors from abroad.
   The National Education Association, a private group, distributed
a letter to Congress in support of Frank's bill. It said the
present law has been used to keep out Primo Levi, the Italian
chemist and novelist, Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez and
Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes.
   The letter from the administration, signed in the name of Joe D.
Whitley, acting associate attorney general, said, ``Unless our
reservations are addressed, the department cannot support the
enactment of this proposed legislation.''
   He asked for changes to Frank's bill that would permit the
attorney general to set conditions for the visit to the United
States of anyone who has ever belonged to a Communist party or to
one of its affiliates.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower Against Yen, Shares Hit New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar ended lower Wednesday against the
Japanese yen, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
finished at yet another high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished at a
record 33,363.83, gaining 42.17 points, or 0.13 percent. The index
had gained 13.33 points to a 33,321.66-point close the previous day.
   The dollar closed at 131.88 yen, down 0.22 yen from Tuesday's
132.10-yen finish. The currency started trading lower at 131.38 yen
and moved in a range of 131.35 yen to 131.95 yen.
   Traders attributed the dollar's decline in Tokyo to a similar
trend overnight on overseas markets following the release of U.S.
economic indicators believed to show a slowdown in the nation's
economy. The dollar closed at 131.41 yen in New York overnight.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Tuesday the nation's consumer
price index in March rose 0.5 percent, up from February's 0.4
percent, while the Commerce Department on the same day said U.S.
housing starts in March fell 5.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.397 million.
   But the U.S. currency gradually moved upward from its opening as
speculative investors began buying dollars due to expectations of
higher interest rates in the United States, a trader at Bank of
Tokyo said on condition of anonymity.
   ``There is no new reason or economic factor to encourage the
dollar-buying in Tokyo, but as long as there is an interest rate
gap between the United States and Japan, demand for the dollar
remains stronger,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei rose following a 41.61-point
overnight gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, the
largest increase this year, driven by the U.S. economic indicators.
   ``The figures were taken positively by participants and
encouraged their purchases,'' said Yoshiro Inouye of Nomura
Securities in Tokyo.
   He said the market's main barometor was mainly helped by
institutional investors' purchases of steels and chemicals.
   ``But the index didn't rise as much as it should due to
political uncertainties still lingering in the market,'' he added.

<HEAD>Post-Strike Violence Leaves Two Dead, 138 Arrested, Blackouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A general strike against the military
government turned violent as police battled demonstrators in
Santiago and other cities and about 50 bomb attacks blacked out
much of the capital.
   Police said they killed two ``extremists'' and arrested more
than 130 demonstrators on Tuesday before calm was restored at
midnight. Large areas of the capital and other cities had been left
without power for several hours.
   Demonstrators fought police in downtown Santiago during daylight
Tuesday and then at night in the slums that ring the city.
   The strike, called by the nation's largest union to protest the
incarceration of two labor leaders, failed to generate support from
workers but there were clashes between helmeted riot police and
demonstrators in Santiago and other cities.
   Police said six officers and a security agent were injured in
clashes but they did not report injuries among protesters.
Hospitals reported receiving ``numerous'' injuries.
   The Interior Ministry said 138 protesters were arrested
nationwide and that police resorted to using tear gas and water
cannon to scatter the mostly young demonstrators.
   At night, demonstrators blocked traffic at intersections in
Santiago's slums, erecting fire barricades. Local radio stations
said unidentified gunmen in speeding cars were seen shooting at
demonstrators manning the barricades.
   In the most serious incident, police said two ``extremists''
were killed in a clash with security forces when they were caught
planting a bomb near an electrical tower in northern Santiago.
   The strike was called by the opposition United Workers Central,
Chile's largest labor federation with 300,000 members. The union
said the strike was to press for the release of its president,
Manuel Bustos, and its vice president, Arturo Martinez.
   Both leaders have been banished in small provincial towns since
September after a court sentenced them to 541 days' internal exile
for calling another general strike in 1987.
   Tuesday's strike, however, seemed to have little effect as most
factories and businesses operated near normalcy, although school
attendance was notably lower than normal.
   The government pronounced the strike ``a total failure.''
   Labor Minister Guillermo Arthur said, ``There has been no strike
in Chile today.'' He said around 95 percent of the nation's 4.5
million workers were on the job in spite of a cutback in the public
transportation system.
   Several of the bomb blasts destroyed or damaged power towers,
blacking out large areas of Santiago and several other cities for
several hours until power could be restored.

<HEAD>Researchers in Italy Report New Approach To Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists Umberto Colombo and Francesco Scaramuzzi
say they achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using a
different technique than the recent cold fusion experiments which
prompted their tests.
   Colombo, head of the National Agency for Alternative Energy at
Frascati, just outside Rome, and Scaramuzzi, who performed the
experiments at the agency, both emphasized that it was too early to
say if their process would prove practical for generating energy.
   Their experiments produced large emissions of neutrons but too
little energy to register, the two men reported.
   A neutron is an uncharged elementary particle of an atom.
Emissions of neutrons are evidence of fusion.
   Fusion produces energy when the cores of two hydrogen atoms
fuse. It is the process that powers the sun. Fission is
atom-splitting, the method employed by conventional nuclear power
plants.
   The Italians began their experiments after Stanley Pons, a
chemistry professor at the University of Utah, and his British
colleague, Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton,
announced to the world on March 23 that they achieved nuclear
fusion at room temperature using common laboratory equipment.
   Researchers have long sought a way to harness nuclear fusion.
Standard experiments have used extremely high temperatures.
   Pons and Fleischmann said their experiment ran for more than 100
hours and produced four times as much energy as it used.
   Their experiments used electrolysis, in which an electrical
current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes,
where the atoms were apparently forced to fuse because of proximity.
   Researcher Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in Utah says
he found evidence of only very low energy output in a similar
experiment.
   Scaramuzzi told reporters on Tuesday, ``After Jones' experiment,
I asked myself, how important is electrolysis? There must be more
than one road to fusion.''
   The Italian experiments did not use electrical current to
trigger the reaction, nor did they use ``heavy water,'' which
contains a heavy version of hydrogen called deuterium.
   Colombo reported, ``The experiment is totally different from
former ones. We have paved the way for a new road to fusion
research. What we don't know yet is if the energy generated is
sufficient to justify practical application.''
   Scaramuzzi, 60, said, ``If this experiment were not of such
great importance to the public, we would never have announced the
discovery at this point. We are still in a very preliminary phase.''
   He said that on two occasions they measured high emissions of
neutrons after placing a sample of the element titanium and
deuterium gas in a special metal tube and subjecting it to various
pressures and temperatures.
   The neutrons appeared in one case after applying high pressure
and low temperature, and in another at low pressure and room
temperature.
   Scaramuzzi said the energy output of his experiment at this
scale was too low to be registered.
   Pons meanwhile said Monday that further experiments yielded even
more energy than the earlier Pons-Fleischmann efforts and ran more
efficiently. He said a controlled fusion reaction was sustained for
more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy water and a
palladium electrode and that recent tests produced roughly eight
times the energy consumed.
   Pons said researchers measured the production of 20 to 30 watts
of electricity from the experiment, or about 67 watts per cubic
centimeter of electrode, compared to 26 watts per cubic centimeter
in the earlier experiments.
   He reported that more than 60 university and private
laboratories partly verified the claims he made last month with
Fleischmann.
   The official Czechoslovak news agency CTK said Tuesday that a
team of Czechoslovak physicists led by Pavol Povinc also produced
room-temperature fusion through the electrolysis method.
   The team, from the Comenius University's faculty of mathematics
in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, said they achieved fusion on
Monday.

   Descriptions of dismemberment and a
skull being split open were read in court from statements of
accused members of an occult group of drug smugglers that
authorities said killed 15 people.
   Separately, the ``godfather'' of the group and his girlfriend
were among 11 people indicted Tuesday by a grand jury in McAllen,
Texas.
   Alfonso de Jesus Constanzo, Sara Aldrete and the others were
charged with conspiracy to import marijuana, importing marijuana,
conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and possession with
intent to distribute, authorities said.
   Constanzo, Aldrete and four others remained at large.
   With Judge Francisco Salador Perez of the Fourth Federal Court
presiding late Tuesday, court officials here read aloud from the
statements given by the five men arrested in connection with the
killings. The victims included Mark Kilroy, a Texas student
abducted during a spring-break outing to Matamoros in March.
   The five stood together, handcuffed and silent during the
preliminary hearing.
   They smoked occasionally as they listened to the description of
the horrors that occurred during ceremonies in a wooden shack on a
ranch near where most of the killings took place.
   The accused said those ceremonies were part of a ritualistic
cult.
   Four of the men refused to corroborate or deny the written
statements, arguing that their attorney was not present. They
declined a court-appointed counsel's help.
   Defendant Elio Hernandez told reporters near him that the
statement read to him ``did not agree entirely with what I
declared.''
   The judge said that the accused can submit additional statements
or have their own attorneys later. He now has three days to
consider the evidence and decide whether to continue to hold them
without bail.
   The accused have identified Constanzo as the group's leader who
offered them ``luck and protection'' in exchange for the human
sacrifices.
   Besides Hernandez, those under arrest are his brother, Serafin
Hernandez; Sergio Martinez; David Serna; and ranch caretaker
Domingo Reyes.
   Reyes was the only person who ratified his original statement
that led police to the ranch and the discovery of the bodies.
   ``The godfather asked us for a gringo for a sacrifice,'' read
the statement by Serafin Hernandez.
   ``He said the brains had to be placed in a pot.''
   Serafin Hernandez described how they picked up Kilroy by
offering him a ride. The student later tried to escape, but was
caught and taken to the ranch blindfolded.
   Also described was how Kilroy was killed with a machete blow to
the back of the head:
   ``We called the godfather at the hotel and told him what he
wanted was ready. He came in the next day ... the godfather and
Elio and others were inside (the shack). We heard a noise like a
coconut being cut open and ... they took out his brains ... and
part of the spine, and they cut his legs.''
   Serna's statement described how the group once raided another
ranch, stealing nearly 660 pounds of marijuana and abducting three
people.
   They were brought back to the ranch tied and blindfolded.
   ``We dug a hole and the godfather threw them in still alive and
machine-gunned them.''
   Juan Benitez Ayala, commander of the Federal Judicial Police in
this border city, said four of the 15 men found buried were
randomly chosen human sacrifices. The rest probably were drug
traffickers the organization found necessary to eliminate, he said.

<HEAD>NBC Keeps Ratings Lead Amid Slumping Viewer Numbers</HEAD>

   NBC captured its fourth straight ratings
victory but the broadcast networks' audience continued to dwindle.
The networks blamed the scriptwriters' strike, cable and
independent TV stations, and negative reviews.
   The three networks' combined share of the prime-time TV audience
was 68 percent _ the lowest in television history and about 3
percent below last season, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Last year's five-month Writers Guild of America strike delayed
the usual September start of almost every series, forcing NBC, ABC
and CBS to produce ``writerproof'' programs such as news specials
and new productions of old scripts from series like ``Mission:
Impossible.''
   NBC escaped the brunt of the strike because it broadcast the
1988 Summer Olympics and the World Series, popular sports specials
unaffected by the labor dispute.
   It won all 30 weeks of the September-to-April season, the first
time any network has done so since 1963-64, and claimed three of
the four most popular series, Nielsen said Tuesday.
   The network's margin of victory _ 24 percent _ was the
second-largest in Nielsen ratings history, the network said. For
the 1956-1957 season, CBS had a 25.6 rating, 27 percent ahead of
NBC, which had a 20.1 rating.
   ``It's something we're all very proud of,'' said Robert Wright,
NBC's president and chief executive officer.
   ``What the writers' strike did is hurt the new product,'' said
David Poltrack, CBS' senior vice president of planning and
research. ``The strike had an impact. It was not an even impact. It
helps the established competition.''
   The strike also boosted the performance of the Fox Broadcasting
Corp., Poltrack said. ``It was during the strike period that
`Married With Children' and `America's Most Wanted' started to
produce big numbers,'' he said.
   Boosted by its situation comedy ``Roseanne,'' the season's
highest-rated new series, ABC finished in second place. CBS came in
last among the Big Three for the second consecutive year.
   ABC and CBS disputed NBC's calculations, saying the television
season really began Oct. 24. Although both networks reported the
same order of finish, their numbers depicted NBC's victory in less
overwhelming terms.
   Based on NBC's figures, the network had a yearly rating of 16.0,
followed by ABC with 12.9 and CBS with 12.6, or a combined 41.5.
Last year, the combined rating was 42.8. Since each rating point
equals the 904,000 households with televisions, the networks' loss
was an estimated 1.175 million homes.
   Led by No. 1 hit ``The Cosby Show'' and the situation comedies
``A Different World,'' ``Cheers,'' ``The Golden Girls'' and
``ALF,'' NBC had 13 of the top 20 programs last season.
   The ratings for the week ending April 16 _ the end of the TV
season _ had NBC as the winner with a 14.5 rating, followed by CBS
with 12.7 and ABC with 12.1.
   NBC has won 43 ratings weeks in a row and is just four weeks
from CBS' all-time consecutive win record. NBC last lost a week in
the ratings in June 1988.
   ``What we have now is one No. 1 and two No. 3s,'' said Werner
Michel, senior vice president for Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt
advertising agency.
   ``It's never good for the industry to have one network so
dominant,'' he said. ``It limits your programming choice and your
media choice. You can't put everything on NBC.''
   But NBC, once the media's darling, came under attack from many
television critics who believed the network had turned to the
tawdry.
   Among the targets: the racy miniseries ``Favorite Son,'' the
lurid movie ``Full Exposure'' and Geraldo Rivera's sensational
documentary on devil worship.
   The season's most-watched miniseries was CBS' ``Lonesome Dove,''
the adaptation of novelist Larry McMurtry's account of a cattle
drive. In second was ABC's ``Women of Brewster Place,'' starring
Oprah Winfrey, and NBC's ``Brotherhood of the Rose.'' ``War and
Remembrance,'' ABC's $100 million epic miniseries, finished in
fourth.
   Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior vice president of marketing and
research services, said his network was encouraged by its strong
showing on Friday and Tuesday nights, the latter anchored by
``Roseanne.''
   Still, he said the networks' overall losses likely will
continue. ``I expect we'll see a fairly similar decline next
year,'' he said. ``The loss will be consistent until the mid-'90s
when cable penetration levels off.''

   Ruth Berle, wife of comedian Milton Berle,
has died at age 67.
   Mrs. Berle died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Tuesday
evening, said Tim Scerba, a publicist for the 80-year-old comedian.
She had suffered from cancer, he said.
   Mrs. Berle began work in the public relations field in New York
in the 1940s, taking on work for motion picture studios such as
Samuel Goldwyn Productions, United Artists, RKO and Eagle-Lion.
   She was involved in many philanthropic causes in Los Angeles,
including Democratic politics and S.H.A.R.E., an organization
working with mentally handicapped children.
   In 1968, she was a delegate from California to the Democratic
National Convention.
   She met Berle in 1951 and they were married two years later.
   ``Ruth has settled me down,'' Berle once said. ``I call her
Rocky _ my rock of Gibraltar.''
   Born May 14, 1921, in Portland, Maine, she grew up in Paterson,
N.J. During World War II, she served as a first lieutenant in the
Women's Army Corps and by war's end was a company commander and
captain.
   Milton Berle, known as ``Mr. Television,'' was host of ``Texaco
Star Theater,'' and ``The Milton Berle Show.'' His films include
``Tall, Dark and Handsome'' and ``It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.''
   In addition to her husband, survivors include an adopted son,
Bill; stepdaughter, Vicki Walton; mother; and brother.
   The family planned a private burial, with a memorial service to
be announced later.

   House Democrats, looking warily toward the
task of judging Speaker Jim Wright's ethics, have heard his defense
and now turn their ears to their constituents.
   ``When this hits the (House) floor, it's not going to be about
justice,'' lamented Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif. ``It's going to be
about how it will play in Peoria.''
   Members began spreading across the nation to their home
districts after the House adjourned Tuesday for a long Passover
holiday weekend.
   Before they left, Wright worked hard to fortify Democrats for
the inevitable onslaught of questions they will face during the
town meetings, picnics and barbecues of hometown politics.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Times reported today that Wright is
considering repaying $145,000 he is accused of receiving through
improper gifts. The paper quoted an unidentified House Democratic
leader as saying the suggestion had been made to Wright and that
the speaker apparently was considering it. The paper said Wright's
office declined comment on whether he would repay any money.
   Wright, knowing he had to talk to his members before they hit
the road, had committee chairmen cancel any meetings that
conflicted with a special caucus of all House Democrats.
   He spoke for 40 minutes in the closed session, disputing the
ethics committee charges that he violated House rules in 69
instances involving his unusual book publishing deal and his
benefits from a business partnership.
   ``I told them I intend to fight and I intend to win,'' he said.
   Supporters were charged up. ``There's a lot of outrage about how
this whole process has become a Frankenstein'' that's consuming
Congress, said Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y. ``There's never any
allegation that he did anything with corrupt intent.''
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., a second-term member, said
Wright's speech was ``a very important first step in gaining the
confidence of the members.''
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., said he would remain a staunch
supporter of the speaker unless the facts show he did something
wrong. Constituents might not understand at first, he said.
   ``You get beyond the beltway, what have they got besides a
perception?'' he asked. For some members, public perception would
be the only issue, he said with a tone of disapproval.
   ``You know who they are,'' he said, licking his finger and
raising it in the springtime air.
   Along with his appeal to his members, Wright has begun an effort
to win support in the general public through careful management of
his public statements.
   In fighting a charge that he accepted improper gifts from Fort
Worth developer George Mallick, a longtime friend and business
partner who the committee suggested had interest in legislation,
Wright has focused his defense on the $18,000 salary his wife
received from the partnership _ a salary the ethics committee
labeled a gift.
   ``The fact is my wife worked. She earned her pay,'' he told
reporters at a news conference, at which he refused to answer
questions which might dilute his message that he was a proud
husband.
   Wright said he would spend more time later discussing his book
publishing deal, which the ethics committee said appeared to be a
scheme to evade limits on outside income from speaking fees.
   The speaker received 55 percent royalties on his $5.95
paperback, ``Reflections of a Public Man.'' The committee found
that 98 percent were sold in bulk to interest groups who bought the
book instead of paying him a speaking fee.
   Wright's supporters told reporters that it was unfair to
criticize the speaker for taking advantage of House rules, which
clearly exempt book royalties from the limits. They compared it to
the average citizen's right to take advantage of every break in the
tax code.
   ``Do I think the speaker found a quite inventive way to finagle
the rule? Yeah,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the
committee that wrote the royalty rule 12 years ago but who now
criticizes the committee's interpretation.
   Several Democrats said the speaker's troubles could remain even
if there's no major sanction from the committee. The committee
could recommend anything up to an expulsion from the House,
although that's not now contemplated.
   Of course, the general public gets its perceptions from a wide
variety of sources besides their lawmakers and new reports. Wright
could not have been cheered that he made the monologue of NBC's
``The Tonight Show.''
   ``A lot of people don't realize it, but Jim Wright is a very
gifted guy,'' host Jay Leno said Monday night. ``The trouble is, a
lot of the gifts haven't been reported.''
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said ethics is a very serious issue
with the public and Wright's toughest challenges lie ahead. ``I
think the speaker is in hip-deep water and the white rapids are
straight ahead of him,'' he said.
   Ethics committee members said Tuesday the committee's work might
last into June. House Republicans, with few exceptions, have
adopted a strategy of refraining from criticizing the speaker's
ethics while the case is still undecided.
   But the GOP is hoping Wright's troubles make the public more
receptive to its message that it is time to make Republicans the
majority party for the first time since President Eisenhower's
first term.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., and Rep. Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla., held a news conference Tuesday to announce their
party's agenda and complain about the pace of legislation this year.
   ``It's time for Democrats to help govern or get out of the
way,'' Edwards said.

<HEAD>Dollar Off, Nikkei Hits Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against the Japanese
yen, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose slightly to
another record high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
33,363.83, up 42.17 points, or 0.13 percent. The index set its
previous high of 33,321.66 points on Tuesday, when it edged up
13.33 points.
   The dollar closed at 131.88 yen, down 0.22 yen from Tuesday's
132.10-yen finish. It opened at 131.38 yen but generally moved up
during the day, while ranging from 131.35 yen to 131.95 yen.
   Traders said the currency's lower opening in Tokyo followed a
drop on overseas markets, where discouragement over U.S. economic
figures released late Tuesday in Washington led to dollar-selling.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Tuesday that the nation's
consumer price index in March rose 0.5 percent, up from February's
0.4 percent, while the Commerce Department said U.S. housing starts
in March fell 5.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.397 million.
   ``But market players (in Tokyo) began buying back the dollar
toward the end of the morning session for their position
adjustments because they thought they had sold too much ahead of
the report,'' said a trader with Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   There were not enough dollar-buying incentives to push the
dollar above 132 yen, he added.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started higher following a
41.61-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York
overnight, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Participants took the U.S. economic indicators positively as
showing a slowdown in the nation's economy,'' he said.
   Such a slowdown now would ease fears of inflation, prompt
expectations of lower interest rates and encourage stock
investment. Lower U.S. interest rates, however, make the dollar
less attractive to foreign investors.
   The dealer added that Japan's political uncertainties ``have
largely discouraged foreign and institutional investors, who hardly
participate these days. Major players are only individuals.''
   Today's trading was active, with first section volume estimated
at 1.4 billion shares, up from Tuesday's 1.1 billion. Among gainers
were steel and chemical issues.

<TEXT>
   Scientists at Stanford University say
their experiments with cold fusion prove the energy generated could
not have come from a chemical reaction as some skeptics have
suggested.
   The researchers revealed their findings Tuesday, one of several
announcements made around the world related to the discovery of
University of Utah chemist Stanley Pons and British colleague
Martin Fleischmann.
   _In Rome, Italian scientists said they achieved fusion at room
temperature with a different process than the one in the Utah
experiments, which used electrical currents in ``heavy water'' to
trigger the reaction. ``We have paved the way for a new road to
fusion research,'' said Umberto Colombo, head of the National
Agency for Alternative Energy.
   _In Czechoslovakia, a team of physicists said they also produced
room-temperature fusion.
   _In New Mexico, Pons said he wants to help Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientists duplicate his cold fusion experiments so the
lab will collaborate with him on research.
   The apparent discovery of cold fusion was announced March 23 by
Pons and Fleischmann, who set off an international debate about
whether the process was indeed fusion.
   Pons and Fleischmann said they had achieved fusion using
ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperatures. Standard
experiments have used extremely high temperatures, making them
impractical for large-scale energy production because they use more
energy than they produce.
   Since the announcement, scientists have been trying to duplicate
the experiment and its results. If fusion can be created as easily
as Pons and Fleischmann claim, scientists say, it could be a
relatively inexpensive and virtually inexhaustible energy source.
   The Stanford finding came from a team of seven researchers led
by Roert A. Huggins, professor of material sciences.
   Displaying a simple experiment with palladium electrodes in
tubes of heavy water and plain water in a plastic picnic basket,
Huggins said the energy generated was not the result of any known
chemical reaction.
   Huggins wouldn't speculate on why the experiment produced a 50
percent energy gain in heavy water, but he acknowledged the most
likely cause was some kind of fusion process.
   ``We're seeing excess heat that's above and beyond any possible
chemical reaction,'' he said. ``It means the effect is real and is
substantial.''
   The energy may result, however, from a different type of fusion
than is commonly known, he said.
   Huggins' team ran five experiments over two weeks, using a tube
of deuterium oxide, or heavy water, and a tube of plain water. If
the experiments produced the same results, they said, it would
indicate the energy was not from fusion.
   Instead, they found much higher temperatures from the heavy
water, which meant the energy was not a chemical reaction because
there is no essential chemical difference between the two kinds of
water.
   Last week, two graduate students at the Univeristy of Washington
said they had detected cold fusion in an experiment conducted with
heavy water, but they could not get the same results using ordinary
water.
   On Monday, Pons said the apparent cold fusion discovery had been
partly verified by more than 60 university and private
laboratories, but none has reported observing both the production
of neutrons and the high level of heat that he and Fleischmann
produced. The experiment at Stanford was not designed to measure
neutrons.
   Neutrons are a tell-tale sign of fusion, the process powering
the sun, in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when
hydrogen atoms fuse. In contrast, conventional nuclear power plants
use fission, the splitting of atoms.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large numbers of U.S. diplomats canceled seats on
Pan Am flights in the weeks before the bombing of Flight 103,
according to a U.S. Congressional panel that saw internal Pan Am
documents, a British newspaper reported today.
   The Independent, a respected daily, said documents sent to a
House of Representatives panel probing the Dec. 21 bombing show
that Christmas holiday traffic for U.S. embassies had been heavily
re-booked prior to the bombing.
   The report noted that relatives of those who died in the bombing
have been angry that warnings of a possible bombing of a Pan Am
flight from Frankfurt to the United States were not made public.
   All 259 people on Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 on the ground were
killed when the New York-bound Boeing 747 was blown up over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie. The flight had originated in Frankfurt,
West Germany.
   ``A private House of Representatives transportation subcommittee
memorandum on the documents, which has been seen by The
Independent, said that it had asked Pan Am for all internal
documents relating to security procedures and for information about
who knew of the threat,'' the paper wrote.
   ``Included among the documents it received were internal company
telegrams and memoranda. The subcommittee memo said that one Pan Am
internal request read that `specific details on lost revenue for
U.S. State Department officials' were required. A second was a
request for `public information guidelines' in view that about 80
percent of holiday traffic of embassy is re-booking.
   ``The subcommittee memo, dated 13 March, goes on to say that Pan
Am needed to be asked what were `the details of lost revenue since
Pan Am was obviously keeping track of threat-related
cancellations.'''
   The U.S. government has denied that its officials, acting on the
warnings, had thus avoided Pan Am flights, the report said.
   Copies of what The Independent described as a ``supposedly
secret'' alert bulletin from the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration were posted on notice boards at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow on or around Dec. 13.
   The FAA bulletin was drawn up after an anonymous caller to the
U.S. Embassy in Helsinki said a bomb attack would be made in the
two weeks after Dec. 5. The FAA bulletin was sent to embassies so
that they could inform foreign governments.
   Since the Lockerbie bombing, the United States and the Finnish
police have maintained that the telephoned warning was a hoax. But
no attempt was made to withdraw the bulletin in the days before the
bombing, The Independent said.
   Relatives of those who died on Flight 103 have maintained it was
inevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin, warning
friends and relatives and canceling Pan Am reservations.
   On April 7, Clayton McManaway, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for
counterterrorism, told the U.S. Senate: ``That is not true,'' the
newspaper note.
   The report said McManaway pointed out then that 31 U.S.
government personnel died in the bombing.
   He added that the decision of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to post
copies of the warning was not in accordance with U.S. government
policy and that steps were being taken to prevent it happening
again.

<HEAD>Contras Charge Sandinistas Slaughter Rebel Backers</HEAD>

   Nicaraguan rebel leaders say the leftist government
has broken recent peace accords by killing dozens of Contra
supporters. The allegation received backing from the human rights
group Americas Watch.
   ``The Sandinista government is massacring supporters of the
resistance,'' Contra director Aristides Sanchez said at the group's
Miami headquarters Tuesday. ``They are wiping out our entire social
base.''
   With elections approaching, the Contras charged that the
Nicaraguan military has been slaughtering between 40 and 50
civilians during the past two months in northern Nicaragua, where
the U.S.-backed rebels once found their strongest support.
   Sandinista soldiers, the Contras said, killed 13 rebel
supporters in the town of Apantillo alone.
   In Washington, Americas Watch, which has frequently criticized
the Contras, backed up the Contra version of events.
   ``We have written the Nicaraguan government and are waiting to
see what they are doing about this,'' said spokesman Juan Mendez.
``We cannot dismiss them as isolated incidents any more.''
   The Contras withdrew from the northern region after a recent
series of peace accords, said Adolfo Calero, another of the seven
rebel leaders.
   But that withdrawal left rebel supporters open to repression, he
said.
   ``They are taking advantage of the truce and the peace
agreements to eliminate all our supporters,'' Calero said.
   Another charged raised at the Contra news conference was that
the Sandinistas have mined roads along the Honduran and Costa Rican
borders.
   Calero said Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council, set to
oversee planned national elections next year violates Sandinista
promises made at a meeting of Central American leaders in El
Salvador that a ``balanced'' commission would be created.
   He said Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and the national
assembly controlled by the Sandinistas are planning to appoint and
approve all five members. Two members were to be chosen by the
opposition.
   ``This is no way to initiate the electoral process in
Nicaragua,'' Calero said. ``And we expect the Central American
presidents to demand it be changed.''
   In Managua, Nicaragua, the defense ministry reported Tuesday
that Contra forces killed three people and injured two in an attack
on a home in the Rio Kama area, 400 miles southeast of Managua.

<HEAD>Junior High Girls Make Superballs, Check Rooster Pulses In Day At
College Lab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Junior high school girls played with
polymers, peered at a horse embryo and checked animal pulses in a
day-long laboratory visit that Hampshire College teachers hope will
persuade them to seek careers in science.
   ``We never did all this stuff in class,'' Tasha Galbreath, 13,
of Springfield said Tuesday in a break from comparing a rooster's
pulse with her own. ``My mother even wanted to come today, but I
told her she's not coming.''
   The annual ``Day in the Lab'' at the private college was started
four years ago by women faculty members concerned about statistics
showing fewer girls were choosing math and science courses.
   ``We wanted to show them science is something that women indeed
do and something exciting and personal, not separated from their
lives,'' said Merle Bruno, dean of natural sciences.
   This year's program was dedicated to Denice O'Neill, a pre-med
student who played an integral part in the event until her death
Dec. 22 in the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland on her return
from a semester abroad.
   All three floors of the science building were decorated with
balloons and turned over to the girls, who jumped rope and ran on
treadmills to check their pulses, chewed gum to measure the rate at
which sugar dissolves, heard lectures on AIDS and saw a horse fetus
through an ultrasound machine at the nearby school farm.
   Bruno said the college expected 30 girls in the program's first
year but got 117. This year, the number of preregistrations climbed
over 200 as word spread about such seminars as ``Superballs and
Slime'' and ``Blood 'n Guts.''
   Several girls returned from previous years, bringing along
friends, sisters and parents. East Longmeadow science teacher
Richard Roz, who has participated three years, accompanied three
students from his eighth-grade class, his daughter and two friends
from her second-grade class.
   ``I've never worked with slime before,'' said Gina Potorski, one
of Roz' students, who mixed liquid polyvinyl alcohol and sodium
borate into a putty. ``It's cool.''
   She later mixed sodium silicate and ethyl alcohol to make a
high-bouncing polymer called a superball.
   The college sends notices about the program to public and
private schools in Hampden, Hampshire and Franklin counties. The
event falls during spring break for most junior highs.
   Bruno said the college geared the program to junior high girls
because they were at a crucial age in their education. ``Before
junior high, all students test out the same in levels of
performance, enthusiasm, aptitude,'' she said. ``In junior high,
differences appear between boys and girls.''
   One factor in the difference, she said, could be that girls are
subtly discouraged from studying math and science, a pattern the
program is intended to break.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market has surged to a post-crash
high, sparked by news that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in
March.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials shot up 41.61 points to
close Tuesday at 2,379.40. It was the highest close since the
October 1987 stock market crash. The Dow's previous post-crash high
was 2347.14 on Feb. 7.
   Tuesday's move also was the sharpest one-day rise since Oct. 20,
when the blue-chip indicator rose 43.92 points.
   The consumer price increase in March was slightly below market
expectations, cheering investors. The report also raised the
prospect that the Federal Reserve would avert further credit
tightening.
   ``The market is still concerned about inflation but the figures
were encouraging,'' said Jack Garry, equity analyst with Butcher &amp;
Singer Inc. ``The economy appears to be headed in the right
direction.''

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' ``official witch'' has begun a
letter-writing campaign to protest what she and other witches
believe are violations of their civil rights.
   Letters of complaint, stemming from news reports linking a
``witch'' to a cult of drug smugglers connected with the
ritualistic deaths of 15 people found near the Texas-Mexico border,
have been sent to major newspapers and television networks from
Laurie Cabot's Salem-based group, Witches League for Self-Awareness.
   ``We are not satanists, we do not do black magic or any evil
magic,'' said Cabot, who formed the 900-member group in 1986,
shortly after the filming of ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' a movie
witches said made them appear ``stupid.''
   In group literature, the league is described as a ``national and
international anti-defamation organization which is working to
protect the civil rights, dignity and public portrayal of over six
million Witches, Pagans and Pantheists.''
   The witches complained they have been ``portrayed in an
inaccurate, offensive and libelous manner which is in violation of
our constitutionally guaranteed civil right to practice religious
freedom, as well as freedom from harassment, discrimination,
persecution, or the incitement of the public to form adverse
opinions of members of a religious community.''
   Cabot, dubbed the ``official witch'' by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
in 1975, said Tuesday that she and other witches are part of a
legally recognized religion that is ``peaceful'' and devoid of the
evil doings associated with witchcraft stereotypes.
   The recent complaints sent to news organizations such as The New
York Times and NBC News stemmed from news reports about the
murderous cult of drug smugglers in Texas.
   Mexican police have termed Sara Aldrete, the missing 24-year-old
college student believed to be one of the cult leaders, a ``witch.''
   She has been linked to the 15 victims of the cult, some of which
were unearthed at a ranch south of the U.S. border last week.
   ``It's very loose terminology,'' said Cabot. ``These were drug
runners. What they were doing had nothing to do with witchcraft.
Witchcraft has no evil gods.''
   Cabot described witchcraft as a ``nature religion'' that uses a
mixture of astronomy, astrology and psychic powers to heal and make
things better. She said they use potions and cast spells to promote
well-being and general good.
   ``We have families, we have children, I belong to Kiwanis and
the Chamber of Commerce, you know,'' said Cabot, who once owned a
witchcraft store in Salem and is now writing books.
   She said the group hopes to ``re-educate'' people through the
complaints but added that they could someday take court action if
they believe their rights have been seriously violated.

   A man dismantling a 180-foot radio tower
fell from the top but landed without breaking a bone after grabbing
guy wires on the way down, authorities said.
   Ivan Glaze, a foreman on a steel crew assigned to take down the
tower, slipped Tuesday when hooking up his harness, said Associate
State Forester Bill Mercer.
   Glaze fell 10 feet to a guy wire and slid down it for about 30
or 40 feet before he lost his hold again, Mercer said.
   Witnesses said he fell straight down another 40 feet to a second
guy wire.
   ``He hung onto it and rode it down,'' Mercer said.
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``If he had to slip, that's the way
to fall.''
   Glaze, a Forestry employee, ``was pretty cut up and beat up''
but didn't break any bones, Mercer said.
   Glaze was listed as stable late Tuesday at Baton Rouge General
Medical Center.

<HEAD>Court Removes Asthmatic Child From Home of Smoking Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENTON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old girl with chronic asthma is
living in a foster home because a judge ruled her parents weren't
doing enough to keep her away from cigarette smoke.
   Caroline County social workers removed the girl from her
parent's home last month and she remains in a foster home. The
girl's name was not released.
   ``It's a critical situation,'' Circuit Judge J. Owen Wise said
during a juvenile court hearing March 17. Wise placed the child
under the authority of the social services department.
   ``It is not something that the social services or the medical
people are doing on a whim or caprice. They're afraid she's going
to die prematurely and unnecessarily if something isn't done,''
Wise said.
   Wise said the parents could regain custody of their daughter if
they make changes in their lives. He granted them full visitation
rights.
   The child was admitted to a hospital near her home on Maryland's
eastern shore, across the Chesapeake Bay from Baltimore, at least
half a dozen times over the past year or so, and on two occasions
was transferred to Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore.
Once, she was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of
serious respiratory problems associated with asthma.
   The child lived with her great-grandmother, her legal custodian
from March 1987 to March 1988. Delaware authorities had granted
custody to the relative while the family was living in that state
because the girl's parents could not afford to properly care for
her.
   But in March 1988, Caroline County authorities returned the
child to her parents, who had moved to Denton.
   In January, the child's father lost his job and the family moved
in with the great-grandmother. Until recently, the girl's parents
and great-grandmother smoked.
   Andrea Allen, a physician with Caroline County Health Services,
testified that on at least two occasions, the girl was in severe
respiratory distress when brought to the hospital.
   Ms. Allen said that tobacco, which can bring on an asthma
attack, may have been a critical factor.
   ``My particular concerns about this child include that the
family continued to smoke despite many warnings that this was not
appropriate,'' Ms. Allen said. ``I do know that they tried to smoke
outside the home or at least they were reporting that to us. But
because the smoke is carried on clothing and other articles and in
the car, this simply is not measure enough.''

   The dollar rose against nearly all major
currencies in light European trading early today. Gold bullion fell.
   Barring any unexpected events, dealers said they expected little
movement in exchange rates throughout the day.
   The dollar fell Tuesday in reaction to a U.S. Labor Department
report that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in March, which was in
line with expectations and diminished concern of a rise in U.S.
interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.22 Japanese yen to a closing 131.88 yen.
Later, in London, it edged up to 131.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _ 1.8572 West German marks, up from 1.8528
   _ 1.6320 Swiss francs, up from 1.6283
   _ 6.2885 French francs, up from 6.2750

   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7120 from $1.7185 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $383.15 a troy ounce,
down from $383.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $382.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $382.70, down from $384 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.43 to close at a bid $384.25.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $5.77 a troy

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Freed After 18-Month Detention Without Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Kit Siang comments, details.

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's leading opposition
politician, Lim Kit Siang, was released from prison today after
being held without charge for 18 months.
   With the release of Lim and his son Lim Guan Eng from Kamunting
Detention Camp, 120 miles north of this capital, the
Malay-dominated government has freed all 106 people it arrested
during an October 1987 crackdown.
   The government that year angered many ethnic Chinese, who
generally maintain their separate culture and language, by
assigning non-Chinese speaking teachers to Chinese primary schools.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, himself a Malay, has said the
1987 arrests of opposition politicians, environmentalists, trade
unionists, church workers, educators and others was necessary to
prevent Malay-Chinese rioting.
   But Kit Siang described the last 18 months as ``a nightmare for
democratic rights in Malaysia.''
   His primary concern now, he said, ``is to do all I can to
restore public confidence in democracy and restore Malaysia's image
abroad.''
   Both Kit Siang, who is Secretary-General of the opposition
Democratic Action Party, and his son are members of Parliament and
ethnic Chinese.
   Fellow Parliament members Vethamuthu David and Karpal Singh were
released a few months ago but were told they could not speak to the
press, that they have to report to police if they leave their
hometown, are prohibited from addressing public gatherings and must
report to the authorities every month.
   Mahathir has said that through their actions and speeches those
arrested in 1987 had increased racial tension in Malaysia, where
government policy promotes Malays' economic standing in a country
long dominated by Chinese businessmen.
   Every business in the country must be partially owned by Malays,
who also are given tax breaks for starting their own companies.
Universities teach in Malay, which has been named the national
language, and Islam has been named the state religion.
   The country's 17 million population is 55 percent Malay and 37
percent Chinese, with most of the remainder Indian.
   The races in this former British colony have argued periodically
over language, cultural and other differences, but there has been
no major unrest since 500 people died in Malay-Chinese rioting in
1969.
   When Mahathir became prime minister in July 1981, 550 people
were being held under the Internal Security Act, which allows
imprisonment without trial. Mahathir called for a review and
released most of them.
   Deputy Home Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayub says 70
people are still held without trial under the act.
   Lee Lam Thye, also an ethnic Chinese and a member of parliament
who has been the acting leader of the opposition and secretary
general in Kit Siang's absence, called on the government ``to
release all the other internal security act detainees or charge
them in an open court of law.''

<TEXT>
   While the effort to clean oil-drenched
beaches sputters to life, volunteers armed with dish soap are
wearily trying to save birds marked for death by sticky goo from
the Exxon Valdez.
   Outside a makeshift rehabilitation center in a college
dormitory, already cleaned cormorants gingerly spread their wings
to dry in the sun. Ducks bob in plywood-sided tanks. The smell of
fish used as food permeates the air.
   ``The ones that make it this far, into those tanks, usually make
it,'' said Mike Masson, a volunteer from Cullowhee, N.C. ``If
they're in there they'll probably be OK.''
   Many do not survive after reaching the center, run by the
International Bird Rescue Research Center, a California-based
non-profit corporation.
   The center's executive director, Alice Berkner, said 349
oil-coated birds have been brought in since the tanker rammed Bligh
Reef on March 24, spilling more than 10 million gallons of North
Slope crude into Prince William Sound.
   Of the 349, 136 died from the oil's toxic effects, exposure,
dehydration or loss of bouyancy. Twenty-two have been returned to
the wild. Many are being held at the center because they might
return to the oil-contaminated areas.
   By Tuesday, the Coast Guard had logged 1,850 birds found dead in
the sound since the spill. But the true number of dead birds and
animals will never be known because of the sound's vast distances
and remote shorelines.
   Ms. Berkner said as the oil has spread, the effort to save birds
has widened. She said the organization has opened a cleaning center
in Seward and she was going to Kodiak to open another.
   Luckily, there were few ducks and shorebirds in the sound when
the tanker hit the rocks. It was before the spring arrival of
waterfowl.
   Ms. Berkner was unsure how birds migrating into the sound now
might be affected.
   ``I think right now, let's wait and see,'' she said. ``We're
hoping the slick will break up. ... We're preparing for the worst
and hoping for the best.''
   For Ms. Berkner, this spill is not the first.
   Her first was in 1971, after two Chevron tankers collided in San
Francisco Bay.
   ``I just went down and helped for two weeks. That two weeks
turned into 18 years,'' she said.
   In Prince William Sound, the birds are picked up in the sound by
43 boats under contract to Exxon. The vessels also pick up dead
birds for disposal.
   Once aboard the vessels, the birds are kept warm and given
liquids. Each night, the day's haul is transferred to the cleanup
center.
   In Valdez, the birds are checked for injuries, banded and held
for washing.
   The workers use a popular dishwashing liquid.
   Inside the center, activity seems constant as seven paid staff
members and the 20 or so volunteers rush to clean birds.
   Carpeted floors are covered with plastic. Notes are taped to
walls.
   In the ``dirty bird'' room, candidates for cleaning wait in
plywood enclosures with coarse wire floors. The boxes are covered
with sheets to give the birds privacy.
   ``It takes two to 12 tubs of water to clean the birds,'' said
Mary Scott, coordinator for the volunteers. Just rinsing the birds
can take 45 minutes, she said.
   In the ``clean bird'' room, the birds are held in covered
enclosures warmed by commercial pet dryers.
   Then they are observed in the tanks outside to ensure they can
float and will not succumb to hypothermia.
   The tanks are an attraction for visitors and workers.
   ``This is what makes it worthwhile _ coming out here and
watching the silly birds eating and splashing around,'' Ms. Scott
said.

   Soldiers shot and wounded at least 17
Palestinians in clashes today, including 11 children who suffered
mostly head injuries from rubber and plastic bullets, Arab hospital
officials said.
   Today's violence occurred as soldiers and police beefed up
security in the occupied lands and inside Israel to prevent riots
or attacks on Jews during the seven-day Jewish Passover holiday,
which begins tonight.
   A public opinion survey published by a newspaper indicated 65
percent of Israelis supported a peace plan by Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir that calls for Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
to elect representatives for peace talks.
   However, the Al Hamishmar newspaper said that Jewish settlers in
the occupied lands have formed a committee seeking to stop the
election plan, which they claim would ``bring about a Palestinian
state.''
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers clashed with stone-throwing youths
today in the Khan Yunis and Nusseirat refugee camps, the village of
Beit Hanoun and a neighborhood in Gaza City.
   Arab hospital officials said the wounded included six chidren
age 14 or younger who were hit with rubber bullets in the head and
face. Five other youths were struck with plastic or rubber bullets
in other parts of the body.
   The officials said six people ages 17 to 30 also were injured
with plastic bullets.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police detained 27 Palestinians accused
of involvement in stone-throwing riots after midnight, in which
three policemen and two Arabs were injured, said the Jerusalem
police spokesman, Uzi Sandori.
   In the 16-month uprising, 439 Palestinians have been killed,
most shot by soldiers quelling stone-throwing protests. Eighteen
Israelis also have died.
   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said it conducted the public
opinion survey on Shamir's plan April 12-16 in face-to-face
interviews with a random sample of 656 Israelis. Sixty-five percent
said they supported the elections plan and 31 percent were opposed,
while 4 percent said they had no view, the newspaper said. No
margin of error was given for the poll.
   A Western relief official in Gaza City said that about 40
percent of the wounded in the Palestinian revolt are now 15 and
younger.
   ``In the beginning of the uprising, the average age of those
getting shot was much higher,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

   A man who claimed he could breach President
Bush's security was freed on $50,000 bond and ordered to undergo a
four-month psychiatric review.
   U.S. Magistrate Steven Pepe on Tuesday scheduled Richard
Gregory's arraignment on a federal misdemeanor charge for May 3.
   Gregory, 37, of Macomb County's Clinton Township, was arrested
Monday when he showed up at Selfridge Air National Guard Base near
Mount Clemens. Bush had departed from there after speaking in
Hamtramck that day.
   Gregory had called the White House earlier and left his car
telephone number, said Jim Hughes, head of the Detroit Secret
Service office. He said he could breach Bush's security and that it
``involved a man wearing a business suit and carrying a cellular
telephone that would actually be an explosive device,'' Hughes said.
   Police traced the telephone number and were on the lookout for
Gregory when he showed up at the gate wearing a suit and carrying a
car phone and briefcase, Hughes said. Neither the briefcase nor the
telephone contained explosives.

   A Christian Science couple was found
guilty of murder for allowing their 7-year-old diabetic daughter to
die without medical attention because of their religious beliefs.
   William Hermanson, 42, and his wife, Christine, 38, could be
sentenced to three to seven years in prison under state sentencing
guidelines. They were allowed to remain free until sentencing. No
sentencing date has been set.
   A jury found the Hermansons guilty Tuesday of third-degree
murder and child abuse in the 1986 death of their daughter, Amy.
They had rejected a plea bargain agreement for 15 years' probation
in exchange for a plea of guilty or no contest.
   ``We will be filing motions for a new trial,'' said defense
attorney Charles Arnold. He said he was ``disappointed and
surprised'' at the verdict.
   The Hermansons were the first Christian Scientists in 20 years
prosecuted in the United States for denying a child medical care
for religious reasons, church representatives said. Five other
religious exemption cases are pending, three in California, one
each in Arizona and Massachusetts.
   The defense said the case was about religious freedom and cited
a 1975 Florida law that protects parents who withhold medical
treatment from their sick children if they are ``legitimately
practicing'' their religious beliefs.
   Prosecutors contended it was murder, saying the girl died after
her parents ignored pleas to take her to a doctor and relied
instead on prayer to heal her untreated diabetes.
   Christian Scientists rely on prayer instead of medicine to care
for the ill and may call on church-accredited ``practitioners''
with expertise in spiritual healing. However, members may seek
medical assistance without fear of sanctions.
   Nathan Talbot, church spokesman from Boston, said the conviction
would tend to unify Christian Scientists.
   The church must ``do a fuller job of helping society understand
that it has a wonderful gift in spiritual healing and it would be a
loss for all of us to prosecute out of existence spiritual
healing,'' he said.
   But Rita Swan, a former Christian Scientist from Iowa who began
a campaign to fight religious exemption laws after losing a son to
meningitis 12 years ago, called the verdict significant.
   ``It signals to the nation that society does not approve of this
behavior, and Christian Scientists had better wake up and listen,''
she said. ``These jurors could not accept the notion that a child
should be allowed to die of diabetes for which, everybody knows,
there is a standard, very effective treatment.''
   Last week, with the jury out of the room, a witness testified
that both parents had sought medical treatment for themselves but
not for their daughter. The jury never heard that testimony because
the judge ruled that prosecutors had improperly withheld the
information from defense attorneys.

<HEAD>Alert To Prevent Guerrilla Attacks During Passover</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel placed its security forces on high alert
today to prevent guerrilla attacks during the Passover holiday, and
thousands of Israelis traveled to beach resorts or headed home to
be with relatives.
   The weeklong Jewish holiday commemorates the exodus of the
ancient Israelites from Egypt and begins at sundown Wednesday with
a traditional meal known in Hebrew as a Seder.
   Thousands of police and border patrol reinforcements were
deployed across the country, and police maintained a large presence
in Jerusalem's walled Old City to prevent disruptions of religious
services, a police spokesman said.
   The 16-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip has increased the concern in Israel about attempts by
Palestinian guerrillas to carry out attacks during the holidays.
Police appealed to the public in a statement published in all
newspapers to report suspicious people or packages.
   The army increased its forces to prevent guerrilla infiltrations
across Israel's borders, especially the northern frontier with
Lebanon. So far this year, 31 guerrillas have been killed in a
dozen attacks on the northern border.
   An army spokesman would not give out details of troop
deployments.
   The army organized Passover meals in military bases, but
soldiers serving in the occupied lands will celebrate the meal in
shifts and will be given grape juice instead of the traditional
four cups of wine, an army spokesman said.
   Budget restrictions forced the army to cancel the headquarters
Passover feast, which is traditionally held at a different base
each year and is attended by the chief of staff and dignitaries.
   The army took austerity measures after asking the government for
an additional $138 million to covere increased costs of quelling
the uprising.
   In Tel Aviv, U.S. Ambassador William A. Brown participated in a
symbolic Passover Seder organized by Soviet Jewish activists to
thank the United States for its efforts on behalf of Soviet Jews
being refused permission to emigrate.
   Organizers set up a table on the sidewalk across the street from
the embassy, serving wine and traditional Passover dishes.
   Israelis headed home to their families today, while others
planned to spend the holiday weekend in resort areas such as the
Sea of Galilee and the Red Sea port of Eilat.
   Passover is Israel's equivalent of the Christmas shopping
season, and Israelis crowded shopping centers and supermarkets to
do their last-minute shopping before stores closed this afternoon.
   During the holiday, many Jews abstain from eating bread or
consuming other leavened products such as beer to identify with the
ancient Israelites, who fled Egypt so quickly they had no time to
leaven yeast for bread.
   Many Israelis have carried out traditional spring cleaning,
removing all bread and leaven from their homes. This morning,
religious Jews performed the tradition of burning the last
remaining bread crumbs outside their homes.
   In Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood, children
built a bonfire on the main street and dozens of young boys, most
in shorts with their side-curls flying, were seen tossing bags of
bread onto the fire.
   In Tel Aviv's Bnai Brak neighborhood, ultra-Orthodox Jews
carried plastic bags of bread to barrels or open fields and set
them alight. Others dunked pots and pans in barrels of boiling
water to purify them of any bread.

   Attackers ambushed the first U.N. convoy
bringing relief supplies to rebel-held southern Sudan, destroying
the lead vehicle and reportedly killing eight rebel escorts, U.N.
officials said today.
   Diane Weathers, a U.N. World Food Program spokeswoman, said a
driver and two assistants also were wounded in the Tuesday
afternoon attack 14 miles west of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army base at Kapoeta.
   The 14-truck convoy was carrying 100 tons of food and relief
supplies to the town of Torit, 100 miles west of Kapoeta.
   It was the first relief convoy to Torit under Operation
Lifeline-Sudan, the U.N.-organized effort to stock more than
100,000 tons of food and supplies in southern Sudan before rain in
May makes transportation virtually impossible.
   The effort is intended to avert another tragedy like that in
1988, when relief officials say about 500,000 people died from
drought.
   The operation began April 1 after the government and the rebels
agreed to allow aid to move unhampered through rebel-held and
government-controlled land.
   U.N. officials in Nairobi did not say who they believed was
responsible for Tuesday's ambush, but they said it was unlikely
Sudan People's Liberation Army rebels would attack their own
members.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms against the
Moslem-dominated government in 1983, demanding greater autonomy and
economic development for the predominantly Christian and animist
south.
   A French monitor for the World Food Program was riding with the
convoy when it was attacked and reported the incident Tuesday night
to U.N. officials, said Ms. Weathers.
   Eight rebel escorts, members of the People's Liberation Army's
Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association, were killed by
automatic weapon fire, and the lead vehicle was destroyed by ``some
sort of missile,'' said Paul Mitchell, a U.N. spokesman. Mitchell
did not know whether the rebel escorts were armed.
   He said that because of the attack, Operation Lifeline's
overland route to Torit from Kapoeta would be suspended. He said an
airlift from the Ugandan city of Entebbe would begin Friday to
Torit, which was captured by rebels in March.
   Ms. Weathers said in the last three weeks, Torit's population
has soared from 3,000 to 25,000 as displaced Sudanese seeking
shelter and food pour in. She said the U.N. expected the population
to grow to as many as 50,000.
   Ms. Weathers said that while Tuesday's attack interrupted the
overland relief operation to Torit, the remainder of the aid
operation would continue.
   The United Nations planned to move 25,000 tons of food and
supplies before rains begin in mid-May, but to date U.N. convoys
have moved only 120 tons of food to Kapoeta from Kenya, said Ms.
Weathers.
   The Norwegian People's Aid, in conjunction with the
California-based World Vision relief agency and the U.S. Agency for
International Development, has trucked several thousand tons of
relief supplies to Kapoeta since October in another relief
operation.
   From Uganda, a joint World Food Program-Catholic Relief Services
airlift has carried 3,000 tons of relief supplies to the city of
Juba, home to an estimated 300,000 war refugees and residents.

   About 70 protesters disrupted a City
Council meeting to denounce a proposed immigration service
detention center before police broke up the demonstration.
   The protesters were in the council chambers when members arrived
Tuesday night, and the meeting was recessed until about 20 police
officers led the demonstrators away.
   No arrests or injuries were reported, but debris was strewn on
the floor and signs were plastered on the walls.
   A private firm, working with the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, has asked Oakland officials for permission
to renovate a warehouse to serve as a detention facility. The
council is considering the proposal, but the issue was not on
Tuesday night's agenda.
   It was unclear if the protesters belonged to an organization. A
police dispatcher who answered the phone this morning said no one
was available for comment.

   The state of Mississippi and two
foundations have linked up to fight one of the country's highest
illiteracy rates by putting teaching computers into every public
elementary school within four years.
   Gov. Ray Mabus said Tuesday that the Riordan Foundation of Los
Angeles and the Rord Foundation of New York will make an initial
investment of $1.5 million to begin installing computers this fall.
   He said the foundations would raise an additional $5.5 million
over the next three years. He said the state would provide about
$1.5 million a year in matching funds.
   The computer learning system would be made available to
kindergarteners and first-graders in the state's approximately 500
schools.
   ``We have a goal in Mississippi for everybody to read and write.
I think today we are taking a big step in that direction,'' Mabus
said.
   Mabus said he hoped to get the computer labs _ which include the
computer work stations, listening library station and other working
areas _ in place in about one-third of the state's 150 school
districts by this fall.
   Mabus and his wife, Julie, have promised to fight illiteracy in
the state. Based on 1980 census data, state officials estimate that
as many as 400,000 adults in Mississippi have fewer than nine years
of formal education and most of them are functionally illiterate.
The state's population is 2.3 million.
   ``Mississippi will be the first state in the country, to our
knowledge, to have such an extensive computer literacy system for
its children,'' Mabus said. ``Every child in Mississippi should,
when this program in place, leave the first grade knowing how to
read and write.''
   Dick Riordon said his foundation has provided for similar
computer learning systems in several California cities, and in
Kansas City, Mo., Chicago and New York. But he said this was the
foundation's first statewide effort.
   The project is to use IBM's ``Writing to Read'' systems. The
computers allow children to write anything they can say and read
what they write. It also lets students learn at their own pace.
   ``If they are slow, it doesn't criticize them,'' Riordan said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa flashed the victory
sign as he arrived today to meet with countryman Pope John Paul II
and seek Western aid for Poland in the wake of the historic
reconcilation with his government.
   The pope, speaking to a group of Polish pilgrims at his general
audience, hailed the accords legalizing Walesa's mass labor
movement. He offered prayers to the Madonna of Jasna Gora, Poland's
holiest shrine, so that all Poles will have the ``courage, wisdom
and calm'' to forge Poland's new course.
   Leaders of Italy's three main trade unions met Walesa at Rome's
Leonardo da Vinci Airport along with the ambassador, Josef Wiejacz,
who presented Walesa with a bouquet of red and white roses, the
colors of Poland.
   Noting the presence of the ambassador, Walesa said, ``This is a
sign of the accord and should be a good sign so that we can go
forward together.''
   The Italian trip came a day after Walesa held a symbolic
reconciliation with Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who
declared martial law in December 1981 to crush the Solidarity labor
movement.
   Walesa will meet John Paul on Thursday and also will meet with
the Italian president, premier and foreign minister during his
three-day stay. Walesa is expected to ask for aid to help rebuild
Poland's battered economy.
   On Monday, a court in Warsaw restored the legal status of
Solidarity after a seven-year ban.
   ``For this victory to be complete, we now have to take care of
real issues and to get down to work together,'' the gray-suited
Walesa told a throng of journalists and well-wishers at the airport
today.
   Walesa flew in on a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw,
accompanied by his wife, Danuta, and the Roman Catholic bishop of
Gdansk, Tadeusz Goclowski.
   It was a triumphal return for Walesa, who last visited Rome in
January 1981, in Solidarity's heyday, when the pope gave his warm
endorsement to Solidarity, the first independent labor movement in
the Soviet bloc. The two men met again in 1983 and 1987 during
pilgrimages by John Paul to his homeland.

   Thousands of students demanding the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo battled riot police today with
firebombs and rocks in at least 10 cities, and protesters attacked
a U.S. military base in Seoul.
   Police firing tear gas battled students in campus and street
clashes marking the anniversary of the April 19, 1960, student
revolt that toppled the Syngman Rhee government. Violent protests
were reported in Seoul, Kwangju, Chonju, Chungju, Pusan, Taejon,
Wonju, Kangnung, Chunchon and Iri.
   ``Execute Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!'' students
screamed as they beat drums and brass gongs.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said about 37,000 students
took part in protests at 112 colleges nationwide, but it did not
say how many were violent. Police said they had no overall figures
on the protests.
   Several police officers and students were injured, but police
officials in Seoul said they had no details on injuries or arrests.
The protests appeared to be the most serious in recent months.
   A band of protesters hurled about 20 firebombs into the U.S.
Army's Camp Isabell in Seoul during the night but caused only minor
damage, police and U.S. military officials said. The protesters
fled before they could be caught.
   Radical students claim the United States helps keep the Roh
government in power and are demanding withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops based in the nation. Students have staged a series of
attacks on U.S. facilities in recent months.
   More than 1,000 students at Hankook University in Seoul staged a
furious battle, pelting police with hundreds of firebombs and
rocks. Police in fatigues and visored helmets fired scores of tear
gas canisters and made several charges to force the protesters back.
   Similar clashes occurred at at least 12 other Seoul colleges
after police blocked students from marching into the streets.
   But a student call for evening protests in the center of Seoul
was mostly ignored with just a few protesters yelling slogans on
sidewalks before being quickly swept away by thousands of riot
police.
   Student leaders urged students to imitate the example of the
1960 revolt.
   ``We must strike down the Roh dictatorship and establish true
democracy in Korea,'' a leader at Hankook said as students cheered.
   The government put riot police on top alert nationwide to block
protests. At least 20,000 riot police were deployed in Seoul. Riot
units guarded key government buildings and some major intersections.
   Police officials also said security was increased near
government buildings and embassies.
   The radicals frequently stage violent demonstrations and attack
government offices. They lack popular support because of their
extreme views, and they are not seen as a serious threat to the Roh
government.
   The radical students, who represent a small, but powerful
minority on college campuses, are trying to form an anti-government
alliance with militant trade union groups campaigning for major
wage increases and other concessions.
   About 1,000 striking electronic workers clashed today with riot
police in the southeastern city of Changwon after a protest march.
   A major crackdown was launched on labor strikes after Roh warned
last week that strikes threatened to hamstring the economy. Roh
said strikes had cost $2.4 billion in lost production and reduced
exports by $600 million this year.
   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in December,
1987 and has helped introduce broad democratic reforms, but many
Koreans still identify his government with his authoritarian
predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan.

   A man was charged with murder after the
bodies of his wife and three children were found with their throats
slashed in their home, authorities said.
   The bodies of Nell Virginia Carter, 35, and her children,
Shameka Davis, 13, Natasha M. Carter, 8, and Lee Artis Carter Jr.,
7, were found early Tuesday by family members and police after Mrs.
Carter's brother became concerned that he could not contact her.
   Lee Artis Carter, 36, was jailed without bond. Carter, said by
neighbors to be the father of the two younger children, was first
taken to a hospital for cuts on his wrists caused by a razor blade,
fire department medics Chief T.L. Bryant said.

<HEAD>67 Killed As High-Speed Train Jumps Rails</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The death toll reached 67 today from the
derailment of a high-speed passenger train in which 12 cars jumped
the rails and tumbled down a rocky embankment, officials said.
Another 137 people were injured.
   Twelve cars on the New Delhi-bound express derailed Tuesday 280
miles south of the capital near Lalitpur while the train was
traveling at up to 70 mph, said Mathew John, the chief of railway
safety.
   John said the two diesel-powered engines, first eight cars and
the guards' car on the Karnataka Express remained upright on the
rails. Authorities said the train began its journey Monday from
Bangalore, 820 miles south of the accident site, and was running
several hours late.
   Press Trust of India, quoting survivors, said the cars
overturned when the speeding train braked sharply near a bridge.
About 1,000 people were on board the train.
   ``The train was at a very high speed when I suddenly heard
wheels screeching. Then there was a series of thuds and we found
our coach overturning,'' passenger V.N. Murthy was quoted as
telling the news agency.
   Murthy, 36, said a child was heading toward the restroom when
the train derailed. ``She just got crushed,'' Murthy told the news
agency.
   About 20 victims were killed instantly and the rest died shortly
after arrival at Lalitpur Civil Hospital, two miles from the
accident site, John said. He said 137 people were seriously injured.
   The dead included four men from a 14-member Karnataka
``kabaddi'' team. The team was traveling to Haridwar in north India
to participate in a tournament for the sport, a sort of
rough-and-tumble version of tag.
   John said an inquiry into the cause of the derailment will begin
Friday.
   More than 100 people were killed July last when a high-speed
train ran off the rails on a bridge and fell into a river in the
southern state of Kerala.

<HEAD>Principal Vetoes Article About Pregnant Valedictorian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An article about a high school valedictorian who
has one child and is pregnant with another has been vetoed for the
school newspaper, but the student will be allowed to speak at
graduation, school officials said.
   Chester Smith, principal of Jack Yates High School, said Tuesday
he refused to approve the story about Carrie Mae Dixon, 17, because
it was too personal.
   The article, written by a student reporter is titled ``Against
all odds ... Student becomes valedictorian despite motherhood.'' It
documents Miss Dixon's personal life and scholastic achievements.
   Miss Dixon is a straight-A student who carries a full load of
honors classes, including physics, calculus and economics. After
graduation, she plans to study chemical engineering at the
University of Houston. She has two scholarships.
   She has been shuffled among relatives since her mother died and
her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings. Since she has no
one to baby-sit her 18-month-old daughter while she studies two to
five hours a night, she said she keeps the child occupied with
paper and pencil.
   ``She writes while I write,'' she said.
   Now, at five months pregnant, Miss Dixon dreams of a
``middle-class home and a middle-class life.''
   Miss Dixon said she doubted she would be allowed to give the
valedictory address June 10 because of her pregnancy. But Houston
Independent School District Superintendent Joan Raymond said
Tuesday that Miss Dixon can make the speech and participate in any
graduation activity.
   Newspaper editor Shuronda Robinson said Smith rejected the story
Friday after meeting with Miss Dixon, Miss Dixon's guardian, the
journalism teacher and others from the newspaper.
   Ms. Raymond said Tuesday she agreed with Smith's decision.
   ``Mr. Smith made the decision not to print the article in the
student newspaper about the valedictorian because, in his judgment,
the article was too highly personal, sensitive to the young lady,''
she said.
   ``I support his decision completely and it will stand and I
believe he did the appropriate thing. I have read the article
myself, and I will further tell you that I would have made the same
decision,'' Ms. Raymond said.

   Guards today pushed back about 1,500 students who
tried to storm Communist Party headquarters to demand democracy,
and tens of thousands of protesters later called for political
freedoms during a nearby rally.
   An estimated 15,000 students, workers, peasants, and others
rallied late today in central Beijing's Tiananmen square with
banners eulogizing reformist leader Hu Yaobang and carrying slogans
such as ``Long live democracy and freedom!'' It was the third day
of such protests.
   One student speaker shouted, ``let Cixi retire,'' a reference to
China's 19th century Empress Dowager who continued to exercise
autocratic rule even though in name she had retired. Students said
he was really calling for the ouster of 84-year-old senior leader
Deng Xiaoping.
   ``The old views and system can't satisfy the people anymore,''
one student yelled from a ledge on a monument to revolutionary
heroes in the center of the vast square.
   In Shanghai, more than 1,000 students marched for the third time
in four days and campus walls were plastered with posters demanding
freedom of speech and of the press, witnesses said.
   The demonstrators who tried repeatedly to enter party
headquarters _ engaging plainclothes police in shoving matches _
dispersed before dawn today after about 500 police linked arms and
marched toward them.
   The show of force by police appeared aimed at ending
round-the-clock demonstrations since Monday by thousands of
students in front of Zhongnanhai, the party headquarters, and the
nearby Great Hall of the People, the seat of government.
   The demonstrations are the largest in Beijing since
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung greeted huge rallies of radical
leftist students in the late 1960s in adjacent Tiananmen Square,
where about 10,000 people gathered Tuesday.
   There have been no reports of arrests.
   However, three student representatives who were allowed to enter
Zhongnanhai early in the nighttime protest did not come out,
students said. The compound houses party offices and official
residences for China's leaders.
   Students sitting outside the compound's ornate red-lacquered
gate chanted, ``Come out, Li Peng!,'' a reference to China's
premier. They also chanted slogans heard throughout the protests:
``Down with corruption, overthrow bureaucracy, long live the
people!''
   The official Xinhua News Agency later said some people in the
crowd threw bottles and shoes at Zhongnanhai guards and that one
was bruised in the cheek by a flying bottle.
   One student leader, Wang Dan of Beijing University, said the
students planned further actions every day through Saturday, when
the government will hold a funeral in the Great Hall for ousted
party chief Hu, a reformer who died Saturday of a heart attack.
   Protesters in Tiananmen Square had draped the monument to
revolutionary heroes with wreathes and banners eulogizing Hu from
about 20 Beijing universities and two newspapers.
   The demonstrators demand a party reassessment of Hu, who was
forced to resign in 1987 for failing to be tough on pro-democracy
student demonstrators in 1986-87. Those were the last major
demonstrations in China and triggered a political backlash against
liberalism.
   The students also demand that top leaders publish statements of
their personal wealth and incomes, abolish a Beijing ban on marches
without police permission, increase money for education, allow a
free press and repudiate past anti-liberal political campaigns.
   In Shanghai, more than 1,000 students from Fudan University
marched toward People's Square, said Jason Hurtado of Portland,
Ore., an American teacher at the university.
   An Italian student at the school confirmed reports of a march
and said school loudspeakers were urging students not to go into
the streets, saying their actions were illegal.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump, the billionaire developer who's
been called a few names himself, has called real estate executive
Leona Helmsley a disgrace and a destroyer of her husband's
reputation, a newspaper reported today.
   The New York Post quoted an anonymous source close to Trump as
saying the impetus for the attack was a dispute about a
Helmsley-owned piece of property in Atlantic City.
   The Post said Trump wrote Mrs. Helmsley on April 5:
   ``When God created Leona, the world received no favors. Without
the veil of Harry Helmsley, you would be a non-entity. You would
not be able to randomly fire and abuse people in order to make
yourself happy. ...
   ``Over the last number of years I have watched as you have
virtually destroyed my friend, and a once-great and respected man,
Harry Helmsley.''
   Mrs. Helmsley, who styles herself ``The Queen'' in ads for
Helmsley hotels, and her husband, Harry, are awaiting trial on tax
evasion charges.
   She cited the pending criminal case in declining to comment, the
Post said.
   The paper said Trump would not elaborate on his attack, other
than to add: ``She's a disgrace to the industry and a disgrace to
humanity in general.''
   The Post reported its source said Mrs. Helmsley has refused to
transfer to Trump the lease on a small parcel amid other property
in Atlantic City recently bought by Trump.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other
NATO defense ministers today began talks likely to center on the
politically sensitive issue of upgrading short-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.
   Cheney, attending his first gathering of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, was expected to press the allies for
a new _ and stronger _ commitment to U.S. plans to modernize the
weapons.
   ``I think it is important that we go forward to modernize that
force,'' he told reporters aboard his Air Force jet en route
Brussels. He reiterated American opposition to East-West
negotiations on reducing short-range weapons in Europe.
   ``Now is the time, I believe, to move forward on conventional
(non-nuclear) forces,'' he said.
   Germany, Belgium and some other European nations want NATO to
indicate its willingness to open talks on short-range nuclear
weapons with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Officials said it was unlikely the defense ministers would
discuss the matter in any depth at this two-day meeting. There
appears to be a desire on the part of the allies, officials said,
to show cohesion in advance of a May summit between President Bush
and other NATO leaders.
   The ministers also were not scheduled to make any key decisions
on modernization, which is strongly opposed in some European
countries. But they will be asked to reaffirm their backing to
plans to upgrade the current Lance surface-to-surface missile.
   The United States contends it needs a strong signal from the
allies to lobby Congress for money to continue a
research-and-development program for the weapon.
   Bush and other NATO leaders will meet at the end of May and
discuss the modernization plans as part of a blueprint designed to
guide the alliance in arms control and force planning in the coming
years.
   The modernization issue has become increasingly sensitive in
recent months.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has said he wants to
delay a decision on deployment of the new missile until 1991 or
1992 _ after elections in his country.
   Belgium recently added to the uncertainty by saying it, too,
wanted decisions put off until the early 1990s.
   A U.S. diplomat said decisions on producing and deploying the
missile were not expected for several more years.
   The Lance missile, introduced in 1972, will become obsolete in
1995.
   The missile has a range of 60 miles and its replacement would be
extended to more than 250 miles, just under the limits of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. The accord eliminates
U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to
3,400 miles.
   There are currently 88 Lance launchers, most of them in West
Germany.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, commander of NATO's European forces,
argued for modernizing the short-range missile force in an article
Tuesday in the International Herald Tribune.
   He said the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact ``has undertaken an extensive
modernization program for (short-range nuclear) forces during the
1980s.''
   Galvin has drawn up a report that says replacing the missile
will allow the Western alliance to make substantial reductions in
nuclear artillery. The study was to be discussed by the defense
ministers.
   NATO contends it needs a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent to
offset the enormous superiority the East has built up in
conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons.
   The NATO members are Canada, the United States, Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Turkey.
   France, which is not part of NATO's integrated military
structure, does not attend the nuclear discussions. Iceland takes
part as an observer.

<HEAD>Volkswagen Racial Discrimination Case Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black former employees of a closed Volkswagen
plant have until May 26 to file a claim to participate in a
proposed $718,000 settlement of a 6-year-old racial discrimination
suit.
   Volkswagen of America Inc. and the United Auto Workers agreed to
settle a racial discrimination lawsuit without admitting any of the
allegations filed on behalf of about 800 former employees.
   U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond scheduled a June 13 hearing
to consider approving the settlement.
   Under terms reached March 24, the American subsidiary of the
West German auto company would pay $670,000, and the union would
pay $48,000 without admitting any guilt, said Tom McDonald, VW
spokesman in Troy, Mich.
   Volkswagen also agreed to pay $250,000 in lawyers' fees.
   Citing declining sales of its Golf and Jetta models, Volkswagen
last year closed the Westmoreland County facility, its lone U.S.
assembly plant.
   If the plaintiffs accept the settlement, individual payments
would range from $70,000 to a supervisor who said he was harassed
on the job, to $200 for hourly workers who were fired before their
90-day probations expired.
   The plaintiffs had been seeking $70 million under the class
action suit, filed in 1983.

<HEAD>Mass. High Court Says Paramount Not Liable for Post-Film Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramount Pictures and a movie theater can't be
held responsible for the death of a teen-ager stabbed by a young
man who had just seen a 1979 film about city gangs, the
Massachusetts Supreme Court has ruled.
   The victim's family sued Paramount and Saxon Theater Corp.,
seeking damages on the grounds of wrongful death. It charged that
Paramount and the theater knew ``The Warriors'' was inciting
violence around the country.
   Three days before the Boston slaying, according to court
records, two other youths were killed near theaters showing the
film in Palm Springs and Oxnard, Calif. That same week, Paramount
officers advised theaters showing the film to hire security guards
and offered to pay for them.
   The Massachusetts high court upheld the dismissal of the
family's lawsuit by a lower court on the ground that the
movie-maker and theater company had no ``special relationship'' to
the dead youth and therefore had no duty to protect him from his
attacker. In addition, the court rejected the family's contention
that ``The Warriors'' was an incitement to violence.
   ``Although the film is rife with violent scenes, it does not at
any point exhort, urge, entreat, solicit or overtly advocate or
encourage unlawful or violent activity on the part of viewers,''
Justice Francis O'Connor wrote. ``It does not create the likelihood
of inciting or producing `imminent lawless action' that would strip
the film of First Amendment protection.''
   William Yakubowicz filed the lawsuit in 1981 on behalf of his
dead son, Martin, 16. The youth was stabbed Feb. 15, 1979, at a
subway station several miles from the theater by Michael Barrett,
who was returning from seeing ``The Warriors'' at the Saxon Theater.
   Barrett, who sat through two showings of the movie, taunted
Yakubowicz on the subway, imitating a line from the movie _ ``I
want you, I'm going to get you.''

<TEXT>
   Dame Daphne du Maurier, who became one of the
century's most popular writers by mixing romance and the
supernatural in ``Rebecca'' and other novels, died in her sleep
today at age 81.
   The author of such popular classics as ``Frenchman's Creek'' and
``The Birds'' died at her home in the village of Par, in Cornwall,
southwest England, said Monty Baker-Munton, her executor. He did
not know the cause of death.
   ``Rebecca,'' her most famous work, was published in 1938. It was
filmed starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, and was
reprinted 39 times, selling more than 1 million copies in hard
cover alone.
   Born in London on May 13, 1907, du Maurier was one of three
daughters of the renowned actor Sir Gerald du Maurier. She was
educated by tutors in Paris and at 21 published her first articles
and short stories. Her first novel, ``The Loving Spirit'' in 1931,
captivated a young British army major, Frederick A.M. Browning, who
courted and married her in 1932.
   Widowed in 1965, du Maurier had for many years lived a secluded
existence on the wild Cornish coast that inspired the settings for
many of her works. She shunned publicity. She spent the better part
of her life writing best-sellers in Menabilly, the family mansion
on the Cornish coast.
   Baker-Munton said that at du Maurier's request her funeral would
be private, with no memorial service or flowers, and only close
family and friends attending. He said she would be cremated.

   Kevin Bower was near his 5-year-old daughter
when a pipe bomb hidden in a toothpaste container blew up, and he's
thankful her injuries were not more severe.
   ``We're very lucky,'' he said. ``We have a daughter. Many people
have gone through much worse than this.''
   Two men seen leaving the K mart store after the explosion were
being sought for questioning. Police also interviewed employees and
former employees of the store to try to find out why someone
planted the bomb in the store.
   Authorities also were on the lookout for a second bomb.
   ``The potential for it happening again is always there, either
through a copycat situation or the same individual again,'' said
Detective Sgt. Mike Kouns of the Marion County Sheriff's Department.
   Erin Bower lost her left hand and may recover only partial sight
in her left eye as a result of the Monday's explosion, doctors at
Methodist Hospital said.
   She was listed in fair condition today and ``more than likely
will move out of pediatric intensive care to a regular ward,''
hospital spokesman David Richards said. Her mood was quiet, he said.
   ``There may be some vision left in the left eye. The right eye
appears to be all right, but the left eye has been cut open by the
force of the blast and by flying debris,'' said Dr. William Nunery,
a specialist in ophthalmology, plastic and reconstructive surgery.
``Those injuries can heal with time and they can sometimes be
repaired.''
   Erin's left hand could not be saved, but the muscles and nerves
in the forearm are intact, said Dr. Michael Levine, a plastic
surgeon.
   ``I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility or
probability that she will ultimately have a prosthesis and be
fairly successful with it,'' Levine said.
   The girl's mother, Maurine, 31, was slightly wounded by flying
bomb fragments, but no others were hurt in Monday night explosion
at the store on Indianapolis' northeast side.
   The bomb, hidden in a pump-type toothpaste dispenser, was
concealed among packages of trash bags in the hardware section
toward the rear of the store. The men wanted for questioning, both
believed to be about 20 years old, drew police attention with their
nonchalant response to the explosion.
   ``Usually people want to rush to see what's going on. These two
gentlemen apparently left while everybody else was going in the
opposite direction,'' Kouns said.
   Police released sketches of the men compiled from employees'
descriptions.
   The bomb, which was made of a pipe three-quarters of an inch
thick and apparently filled with black powder, may have been
powered by a battery and detonated when it was picked up from a
store shelf, said Charles A. Petersen, resident agent in charge of
the Indianapolis office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   K mart has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the
bombing.

<TEXT>
   An apparent attempt to cover up a drug trafficking
probe involving a former Metro-Dade police officer is suspected of
setting off Everglades brushfires that shrouded Miami in smoke last
week, officials said.
   Charred documents found by firefighters at the source of the
12,000-acre blaze that started April 8 have been linked to Alex
Marrero, 34, according to Joe Subic, an investigator with the
Florida Department of Agriculture.
   Nine years ago, the acquittal of Marrero and three other
Metro-Dade officers charged with beating a black man to death in
Miami launched three days of riots that left 18 dead and an
estimated $80 million of property damage in Miami's black
neighborhoods.
   The documents, soaked in gasoline, belonged to Eastern Security
and Investigations Inc., a Miami-based company owned and operated
by Marrero. Police suspect the documents were burned in connection
with Marrero's arrest in a sting operation earlier the same day.
   The fire broke out only hours after Marrero's arrest, along with
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Jorge Villar, on cocaine
distribution and bribery charges. They could face up to life in
prison if convicted.
   Subic acknowledged that Marrero's arrest made it impossible for
the former Metro-Dade police officer to have started the fire. But
the investigator speculated that Marrero could have passed an order
to an associate to burn the company records.
   According to Subic, arson charges will be brought against
whoever started the fire.
   State and federal firefighters worked for more than three days
to control the blaze, which shrouded Miami and much of South
Florida in a dense cloud of smoke. It caused $100,000 in damage,
Subic said.

   The Bush administration faced sharp criticism
today for not acting decisively enough in taking control of the
Alaska oil spill, as senators called for new laws that would
require the president to direct such cleanup efforts.
   ``There has never been a time when this situation was under
control,'' declared Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the
Senate environmental protection subcommittee, which convened a
hearing on the oil spill recovery effort.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said that President Bush
was ``slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster'' and
valuable hours were lost after the March 24 spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound when the spill might still have been
controlled.
   Mitchell, of Maine, said federal environmental laws need to be
changed to require the president to either take over oil spill
cleanup efforts or specifically to declare that the cleanup is
being conducted properly through private efforts.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, the president's point
man on the oil spill recovery, who was scheduled to testify before
the Senate panel later, has said that Bush rejected a
federalization of the Alaska cleanup because of concern that such a
move might affect Exxon's financial liabilities.
   The president has said the U.S. Coast Guard is coordinating
cleanup efforts.
   But in a round of opening statements, one senator after another
criticized everyone involved in the cleanup, especially recovery
efforts in the first days after the Exxon Valdez tanker ran
aground, spilling 10 million gallons of oil into the pristine
waters.
   ``From all accounts the cleanup crews initially ... acted more
like the Keystone Cops,'' declared Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   Chafee said the recovery effort demonstrated ``fundamental
shortcomings'' in state and federal government agencies as well as
Exxon. But he said he understood Brush's reluctance to take a more
aggressive role, saying he had been told it stemmed from disputable
legal advice and not from White House disinterest.
   But Baucus said the Bush administration as well as the industry
``have been unbelievably slow to appreciate the magnitude of the
response'' needed to deal with the spill, the worst in U.S. history
which now affects thousands of square miles.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, although not critical of Bush
directly, has repeatedly called for greater federal involvement
immediately after the accident occurred. ``I'm disappointed the
president didn't see it that way,'' said Stevens.
   But Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said that Bush appeared to
have made a decision early on to leave the cleanup effort to Exxon.
``The magnitude of this disaster didn't strike Washington until it
was way too late,'' he added.
   Stevens said the effects of the spill will last many years and
that the total price tag coud exceed $1 billion in cleanup and
recovery. In an attempt to demonstrate the magnitude of the spill,
Stevens said the area threated with oil contamination is the size
of three Great Lakes systems and if it had occurred in Portland,
Maine the oil today ``would be almost down to Washington D.C.''
   In addition to Skinner, the subcommittee also was scheduled to
hear from William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection
Agency, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, who has been critical of Exxon's
handling of the spill, and Lawrence Rawl, chairman of the giant oil
company.
   Meanwhile, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., was scheduled
later today to fly to Alaska for a four-day tour, his first visit
to the area contaminated by the March 24 spill. Lujan's department
is charged with planning long-term recovery efforts for the
region's wildlife and public lands.
   On Tuesday, Lujan announced a joint $6 million, three-year
research program with the petroleum industry to develop better
recovery and cleanup equipment and methods for large oil spills.
   The interior secretary has characterized the recovery equipment
in Alaska as little more than ``tinker toys'' and totally
inadequate for dealing with a spill of the magnitude that occurred
in Prince William Sound when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground.
   He said the inadequacies of the recovery equipment were
demonstrated when containment booms broke repeatedly from the force
of the waves and syphoning equipment was so slow it hardly made a
dent in the amount of oil in the water.
   Lujan said the department and the American Petroleum Institute
would evenly divide the cost of the three-year research effort,
which is aimed at developing and testing new oil burning
techniques, new high-speed steerable booms, and more advanced
skimmer technology for clearing oil from ice-laden waters.
   Various chemicals, some of which are supposed to disperse oil
and some to keep it together, also will be tested under the
program, department officials said.
   Meanwhile, the Interior Department said it was planning to step
up inspections at offshore oil drilling platforms to check whether
the industry ``is prepared to respond'' to an oil spill emergency.
A report on the inspections is to be presented to Lujan late next
month.

   MA`AN, Jordan (AP) _ Police and soldiers fanned out across south
Jordan today to restore order after rioters battled police, looted
buildings and erected stone barricades on a main highway.
   Residents blamed the outbreak on price increases mandated by the
International Monetary Fund. King Hussein, in Washington for a
meeting with President Bush, told reporters ``everything is under
control.''
   He said the disturbances were the result of the austerity
measures.
   At least 18 people were reported injured in the rioting that
broke out Tuesday in Ma`an, a city of 25,000 about 120 miles south
of Amman, and spread to other towns along the highways linking the
capital with the Red Sea port of Aqaba. The violence continued
Tuesday night, but police and soldiers moved into the region today
and restored order with a curfew in Ma`an.
   On Tuesday, thousands of rioters in the city attacked banks,
burned tires, smashed cars and battled police. Minor demonstrations
were reported today in the city of Kerak and at the University of
Jordan in Amman.
   In the capital, Crown Prince Hassan told foreign reporters at
the palace that six civilians and 12 policemen were wounded Tuesday
in Ma`an.
   The crown prince, King Hussein's brother, is acting head of
state while Hussein is visiting Washington.
   Yousef al-Azem, who represented Ma`an in Jordan's now-suspended
Parliament, said from Amman that about 25 people were wounded.
   The crown prince indicated there had been some arrests but gave
no number.
   Tanks, armored vehicles and police cars were parked every few
miles along the important north-south Desert Highway leading to
Ma`an. At several checkpoints, police stopped all vehicles to
question drivers.
   On Tuesday, protesters blocked the highway north of Ma`an at
several spots with piles of rocks.
   ``Civilians here have called it Jordan's intefadeh of prices,''
said a security officer in Ma`an, using the Arab term for the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   However, the crown prince suggested the riots were a product of
``extremist exploitation.'' He identified the instigators as ``some
of the bearded gentlemen'' _ an apparent reference to Moslem
fundamentalists _ who are ``very influential over the groups in the
street.''
   Demonstrators said the protests were triggered by a government
announcement Sunday that prices of gasoline, vehicle fees,
telephone calls and other items would rise by 10 percent to 50
percent immediately.
   The increases are part of an economic accord with the IMF to
restructure the country's $6 billion foreign debt.
   Last month, similar IMF-mandated price increases in Venezuela
led to rioting in Caracas and its slums that left at least 300
people dead.
   ``The main reason for this rioting is because of the price
increases,'' said a hotel worker in Ma`an. ``The government had
better believe that we are starving. The people of the south are
starving.''
   The price increases followed months of deteriorating economic
conditions caused by a foreign exchange crisis that last year
forced the government of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai to devalue the
currency.
   The price increases are part of a government effort to trim
spending.
   Gasoline prices rose by 25 percent to $1.65 a gallon, and the
cost of cigarettes jumped more than 40 percent to $1.57 a pack.
Cooking gas, alcoholic beverages and telephone service also rose.
   Some workers make as little as $93 a month, although wages of
$185 to $370 are more common. Many Jordanian families have six to
10 children.

<TEXT>
   Bureaucracy, slow donor support, bad
planning and the civil war have forced organizers to scale down a
U.N. relief effort to save millions of people in the south from
starvation or malnutrition.
   Attackers on Tuesday ambushed the first convoy bringing supplies
to rebel-held southern Sudan, destroying the lead vehicle and
killing eight rebel escorts, U.N. officials in Nairobi, Kenya,
reported today.
   Even before the ambush, organizers said Operation Lifeline-Sudan
now expects to provide less than half the 100,000 tons of relief
goods believed to be necessary if a second consecutive summer
disaster is to be avoided.
   When the relief effort began April 1, the United Nations planned
to stockpile supplies at strategic points in southern and
southwestern Sudan for people escaping famine caused by the
6-year-long civil war in the region.
   Relief goods must be in place before the summer rains turn much
of the rural south into lakes and isolate areas where the refugees
gather.
   Almost three weeks after the starting date, no deliveries have
been made by trains or Nile River barge convoys, the project's bulk
carriers. Airlifts have been delayed because planes promised by the
United States and other Western donors have not arrived.
   Diane Weathers, a U.N. World Food Program spokeswoman, said the
14-truck convoy to the town of Torit was attacked Tuesday afternoon
14 miles west of a rebel base at Kapoeta.
   U.N. officials in Nairobi did not say who they believe was
responsible for the ambush, but they said it was unlikely rebels
were responsible because of the rebel escort.
   The officials said that overland route would be suspended but
other relief operations would move forward.
   U.N. organizers have given up their original goal of completing
the $132 million operation by the end of April and say it will
continue as long as allowed by the rains, which normally begin in
May.
   Food has been stored in some areas of the three southern
regions, but supplies in other towns are precariously low and the
possibility of replenishing them appears slim.
   Project director Bryan Wannop, local head of the U.N.
Development Program, insisted ``there are signs of momentum
gathering'' and expressed hope that half the 100,000 tons of food
and medicine would be within reach of 2.3 million southerners by
the end of April.
   Only about 26,000 tons are in the stockpiles now, he said.
   U.N. officials say 100,000 face starvation without emergency
supplies. Relief agencies estimated 250,000-500,000 southerners
died in 1988 from the war and the famine it created.
   To attract international attention, the U.N. Children's Fund
flew in actress Audrey Hepburn, its goodwill ambassador, and some
of the bad planning became evident.
   In Khartoum, she was driven around aimlessly for an hour by
escorts who had not been told her schedule.
   Operation Lifeline-Sudan sometimes appears to face an endless
list of problems.
   After promising two military C-130 transport for the airlift,
the United States backed out because American officers thought the
planes might be exposed to hostile fire.
   The Khartoum office of the U.S. Agency for International
Development said it would charter two of the cargo jets but there
is no indication when that will be done.
   Shortages of fuel have grounded available planes and disabled
trucks.
   Bureaucracy contributes to the bottlenecks with such policies as
requiring relief workers to obtain travel permits.
   Customs problems continue despite Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's
promises at the March conference to eliminate them.
   Sudan's cumbersome bureaucratic pace was slowed even more by the
advent April 7 of Ramadan, the holy month when Moslems abstain from
food and drink in daylight hours.
   Khartoum and the rest of northern Sudan are Arab and
predominantly Moslem. The civil war grew out of demands by black
southerners, most of whom are Christians or animists, for autonomy
and a better economic deal.
   Richard Reid, regional director of UNICEF for the Middle East
and North Africa, said: ``There have been lots of disappointments:
that the donor community has been slow in responding, that the
military actions have not diminished, disappointments with the
logistical and mechanical obstacles.''

   Two crewmen missing since their freighter sank
Monday morning might still be alive because the area they are
believed to be drifting in is warmed by the Gulf Stream, Coast
Guard officials said today.
   Twenty-three sailors were rescued after the Star of Alexandria
sank in story seas about 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod. A U.S.
Coast Guard cutter was to continue searching for the two men at
least through the day, said Petty Officer Jeff Crawley.
   On Tuesday, a search plane reported spotting one missing
crewman, but it was not clear whether he was alive. Crawley said
rescuers have not found any further sign of him.
   ``We feel they're still out there or else we wouldn't be
searching,'' said Chief Petty Officer Joe Gibson of the Coast
Guard's New York headquarters.
   Crawley said officials believe the men may still be alive
because of warm currents. One of the men was wearing a life jacket
when he was swept out of a life raft, survivors said. They said the
other man may have injured himself jumping from the ship.
   It was unclear what caused the ship to sink, said Petty Officer
Gary Rives.
   The Ravenscraig, a freighter, picked up the 23 multinational
crew members Monday after rescue planes spotted a lifeboat and a
life raft and guided the 950-foot vessel to them, Gibson said. An
empty life raft also was recovered.
   The men suffered only minor injuries.
   The 500-foot Star of Alexandria was bound for New York City from
Athens, Greece, when crew members reported about 9 a.m. that it
began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds of 30-35 mph,
Gibson said.

   Two Roman Catholic high school seniors
were reprimanded by their principal for hoisting a pro-choice sign
during President Bush's visit here.
   Their sign, raised during Bush's appearance Monday, read: ``My
body. My choice. My right.''
   Amelia Sabornido, 18, said she and Jill Skalski, 17, were called
to the office of Hamtramck St. Florian High School on Tuesday and
told they were in big trouble.
   St. Florian Principal Sister Mary Ann Smith declined to say what
action would be taken against the girls.
   Jay Berman, a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit,
said there would be no expulsion, but it was a serious matter
because the sign associated the school with a position morally
unacceptable to the church.

<TEXT>
   A councilman in Liverpool said today that police,
who have largely blamed the weekend's soccer disaster on
hooliganism and drunkeness, are trying to cover up their own
incompetence.
   The charge came while police and government officials launched
inquiries to determine how a surging crowd was allowed to crush and
suffocate people at the soccer match, leaving 95 dead.
   The Times of London today quoted police officials as saying they
were disgusted by reports portraying Saturday's disaster at
Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield as a consequence of their failure
to control the crowd.
   Paul Middup, chairman of the South Yorkshire Police Federation,
the local police union chapter, claimed drunkenness contributed to
the uncontrolled crush of Liverpool fans outside the stadium just
as the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was beginning.
   South Yorkshire police said today that some fans were arrested
before the game for public order offenses but refused to give any
details.
   To relieve the dangerous crush outside the stadium, police
ordered that a locked gate be opened. The fans poured into a
standing-room ``terrace'' area already crowded with other Liverpool
fans, and victims were trampled or crushed to death against a
10-foot-high steel-mesh fence.
   ``We are quite convinced that a lot of the fans _ many, many
hundreds of them outside that gate _ had been drinking very
heavily,'' he said on British Broadcasting Corp. television.
   Given the behavior police faced outside the stadium, Middup
said, ``I don't know what we are supposed to do and why it should
all be our fault.''
   He also said officers saw people picking up victims' belongings.
The Times said other police officers reported seeing Liverpool fans
picking the pockets of the dead.
   Liverpool City Council leader Keva Coombe called the police
allegations ``baseless, malicious and wicked'' and said they ``are
contradicted by the observations of thousands of people who were
present, from all sections of society.''
   ``None of these allegations were made at the time and any lawyer
will know that they have the hallmarks of an attempt to create a
cover story to cover for their incompetence,'' he said.
   In another development today, Soviet soccer star Oleg Blokhin,
who plays for an Austrian team, condemned the ``deplorable
conditions'' of the Sheffield stadium, the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported from Moscow.
   ``I believe it is an outright crime to pack spectators into
standing sectors like sardines in a can,'' Blokhin was quoted as
saying.
   The disaster has focused attention on England's antiquated
soccer stadiums and the riot fences located in standing-room-only
areas near the soccer goals. News reports have centered on
speculation the deaths may have been caused by the decision of
South Yorkshire police Supt. Roger Marshall to order the gate
unlocked.
   Nine survivors of Saturday's disaster are suing South Yorkshire
police and the owners of the stadium, alleging negligence.
   Police officials quoted by The Times expressed disgust at the
behavior of Liverpool fans as officers attended to the victims.
   The paper quoted one unnamed senior police officer as saying:
``As we struggled in appalling conditions to save lives, fans
standing further up ... were openly urinating on us and the bodies
of the dead.
   ``As policemen on the pitch tried to save the injured, they were
hampered by other Liverpool fans running up, kicking and punching
them,'' the officer said.
   On Tuesday, a senior judge, Sir Peter Taylor, began a
government-ordered inquiry into the disaster by touring the stadium.
   Taylor said it was too early to pinpoint major issues of the
inquiry but said he would look at the effect of liquor on the fans'
behavior.
   The death toll rose Tuesday to 95 with the death of a
hospitalized 14-year-old boy. Nineteen injured fans remained
hospitalized today, nine in intensive care, hospital officials said.
   British soccer fans have a reputation for violence _ rioting
Liverpool fans are blamed for Belgium's 1985 Heysel stadium
disaster when 39 mostly Italian fans died. As a result, rival fans
have been segregated and fenced in at Hillsborough and other
British grounds to keep them from fighting and running onto the
field.

science instructors probably will continue into the next century,
but alternative teacher training programs help offset the
shortfall, a study has found.
   The United States will need about 20,000 new math and science
teachers each year for the next decade, says Linda Darling-Hammond,
lead author of a Rand Corp. study on teacher education, which was
released Tuesday.
   The study found that postgraduate training programs for career
switchers, retirees and other non-traditional teacher recruits
produce about 2,000 science and math instructors a year, or 10
percent of the shortfall.
   Less than half of the demand will be met by graduates of
traditional education programs by 1992, the study adds.
   Ms. Darling-Hammond noted that the National Science Teachers
Association estimates that about 30 percent of the people teaching
math or science are not fully prepared.
   ``Quite often a physical education teacher will be asked to
teach biology because some administrators view the curriculum
requirements as similar,'' she said.
   This produces recurring problems with poor student achievement
in the sciences and math, she said.
   ``Our very best math students, the top 5 percent of our
students, score below the average for students in Japan and
China,'' Ms. Darling-Hammond said.
   ``If we don't improve our ability to produce large numbers of
well-trained people in scientific and technical fields, we will not
be able to compete economically in the international marketplace,''
Ms. Darling-Hammond said.
   The biggest obstacles reported in recruiting and retaining good
science and math teachers are similar to those for teachers in
general: relatively low pay, student disciplinary problems, poor
student motivation, excessive paperwork and assignment to
non-teaching chores.
   The Rand study, ``Redesigning Teacher Education: Opening the
Door for New Recruits to Science and Mathematics Training,''
generally found that there are two ways to increase the supply of
entrants to an occupation.
   ``Increase the benefits or attractions to the field or reduce
the costs of entry. Efforts to improve teacher salaries and working
conditions are intended to address the first of these ... (and)
non-traditional programs attend to the second of these strategies:
They aim to lower the financial and opportunity costs of preparing
to teach.''
   Non-traditional programs focus on training people who did not
consider math or science teaching while they were in college.
   But a Rand survey of 64 such programs, comprising most of the
programs nationwide, found significant differences. In some cases,
programs have been closed for lack of funding since the survey was
done two years ago.
   The extent of study required varied from as few as 16 weeks to
two years or more, requiring completion of as few as nine course
credits to as many as 45. Some provide student teaching experience,
but not all.

<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
arrived today to oversee a new round of peace talks between Iran
and Iraq, but negotiators for both sides said they are not prepared
to compromise.
   At an airport press conference, Perez de Cuellar acknowledged
that the adversaries are ``are still rather far apart'' but said it
is important to keep the eight-month process going.
   The two countries have been trying to work out a permanent peace
accord since they signed a cease-fire in August, ending eight years
of war that killed or injured at least 1 million people.
   Perez de Cuellar declined to predict the outcome of the new
negotiations. However, he said the mere fact that the foreign
ministers of Iran and Iraq agreed to come to Geneva showed their
interest in reaching an agreement.
   Before leaving Tehran early today, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said Iran would not yield in its demand that Iraq
first withdraw its troops from Iranian territory.
   Iran claims that Iraqi forces still hold 1,065 square miles of
Iranian territory. By U.N. estimates, however, only about 260
square miles remain under Iraqi control.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq accused Iran of
sabotaging the talks by ``procrastination, maneuvering and
insincerity'' and warned that the negotiations ``could eventually
collapse.'' He was due in Geneva today.
   The talks are scheduled to start Thursday afternoon at the
Palais des Nations, the U.N. Office in Geneva, after separate
meetings between Perez de Cuellar and each of the two ministers.
The U.N. chief said the duration of the talks depended on the two
sides.
   Iraq has been pressing for early dredging of the Shatt-Al-Arab
waterway along the border. The channel, Iraq's outlet to the sea,
is clogged by sunken ships, weapons, and silt.

   The Long Island Lighting Co. expects to write
off about $2.8 billion in losses if shareholders approve a deal to
scrap the controversial Shoreham nuclear power plant.
   The utility announced Tuesday that it had received permission
from the Internal Revenue Service to deduct such losses. The IRS
had earlier permitted such a deduction under a deal that collapsed
last year.
   The IRS ruling came one day after the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission staff reported that the $5.5 billion plant meets all
federal safety requirements and is ``operationally ready.'' NRC
Chairman Lando Zech tentatively set a vote on the full-power
license for Thursday and all indications are the license will be
granted.
   However, the action may be largely symbolic. Under the latest
shutdown plan, LILCO has agreed not to put the license to use until
its shareholders vote on the negotiated settlement with the New
York state Public Service Commission, the New York and Long Island
Power Authorities, and LILCO's board of directors.
   Under the new agreement, Shoreham would be sold to the state for
$1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of up to 5
percent to ensure financial stability for the company.
   The shareholders must vote on or before June 15, and LILCO
Chairman William J. Catacosinos told the NRC Monday that the
utility's board will recommend that shareholders approve the deal.
   LILCO and the state would then seek to have Shoreham's license
transferred to the Long Island Power Authority. The New York Power
Authority would oversee decommissioning and dismantling of the
plant.
   The plant was begun more than 20 years ago and finally completed
in 1985. Opponents have battled it, with both New York and Suffolk
County officials refusing to participate in emergency planning.
   The state and county officials contended that no emergency plan
would have been workable on Long Island, where the plant is
situated, because of the geography, highway system and population
concentration.

   A North Sea oil field was closed following a gas
leak and explosion at a Shell platform that forced evacuation of at
least 170 workers and halted production of 472,000 barrels of oil a
day, the company said today.
   A spokeswoman for Shell U.K. Exploration and Production said
there were no injuries in Tuesday's explosion on Shell's Cormorant
Alpha platform.
   She said the affected Brent field produces about a quarter of
the British sector's daily oil production.
   Shell U.K. Exploration and Production is the unit of the Royal
Dutch-Shell Group of Companies that operates the Brent oil
production and transport system.
   The Brent system, which is made up of seven platforms, including
Cormorant Alpha, was producing 472,000 barrels of oil a day that
moved through the Cormorant Alpha platform to a loading terminal
off the coast of Scotland, Shell said.
   The Cormorant Alpha platform itself produces 40,000 barrels a
day.
   The leak on the Cormorant Alpha platform, which lies about 100
miles northeast of Lerwick in Shetland, occurred during
installation of an emergency shutdown valve.
   A Shell spokesman said he didn't know how long the field would
be shut down. He said an investigation into the cause of the
explosion was under way.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men believed to be planning a terrorist
attack on Atlantic City have prompted a full-scale alert by state
and local police, a newspaper reported today.
   The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unidentified sources in the
casino industry and law enforcement, reported that the FBI advised
local authorities that the men were being dispatched from an
unspecified Arab country to launch a terrorist assault on an
unspecified target in Atlantic City.
   The attack reportedly was to be a retaliation against the United
States for its April 14, 1986, bombing of Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi's headquarters. The attack killed Gadhafi's infant daughter.
   Sources told the newspaper that the terrorists were supposed to
be traveling from New York to the casino resort with accomplices
ready to help them escape through Mexico.
   The ``operating window'' for the assault was reported to be
April 14 through April 20 _ Thursday.
   State Police Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano refused to
confirm or deny the alert.
   However, marked State Police cars have taken up positions on the
three main entrance roads into Atlantic City and nonuniformed State
Police detectives strengthened their surveillance at the city's 12
casinos, the newspaper reported.
   The FBI and Atlantic City Police Chief Joseph Pasquale would not
comment.
   ``The industry has no comment on any law enforcement activities
in and around Atlantic City,'' said Thomas Carver, president of the
Atlantic City Casino Association.
   Carver refused to say whether casinos had beefed up security or
police had added patrols. He would not speculate on the effects the
newspaper report would have on visitors.
   ``I think the weather has more to do with the attendance in
Atlantic City that anything else,'' Carver said.

   A 105-story hotel with more than 3,000 guest rooms

   The Ryugyong Hotel, being built on Sojang Hill overlooking the

said.
   Builders aim to complete the entire framework before July, it
said.
   The hotel will have five revolving restaurants, a main

   Los Angeles Times on House Speaker Jim Wright:
   House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) stands accused by the House
Ethics Committee of 69 violations of the rules, including an
alleged ``scheme to evade'' the limits on outside earnings.
   To be sure, Wright has only been accused. He has not been
convicted of anything. But that is not the point. The point is that
as a leader of the House, Wright has failed the ... standards of
ethical conduct (that Congress set) for its members.
   By failing that test, Wright has broken the bond of trust and
confidence he needs to continue as an effective officer of the
House. ...
   Wright should resign his speakership now. ...
   These are not idle charges. If they were, 12 members of the
Ethis Committee _ six Democrats and six Republicans _ would not
have voted unanimously to issue its report finding reason to
believe Wright violated the rules. ...
   Most important to him, Wright said, is to defend his personal
reputation and personal honor. ... But only by resigning the
speakership can he conduct that battle without paralyzing the work
of Congress for weeks and months to come.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on President Bush's education proposals:
   For someone who wants to be known as the education president,
George Bush has pretty feeble proposals in his first education
budget.
   Both in his inaugural address and again last week, the president
declared that the nation has more will than wallet, but when it
comes to making progress in education, Washington will have to open
its wallet wider than ... Bush proposes.
   The administration's education package has worthwhile goals. ..
. Unfortunately, to pay for these aims, the president proposes $441
million _ not much by Washington standards and certainly not enough
to make a dent in any of his targeted areas, much less in all of
them.
   Instead of throwing pennies at such problems, ... Bush would be
better advised to restore some of the cuts made by the Reagan
administration. ...
   But if ... Bush wants to make his mark on education, he will
have to rethink how much the nation can spend on improving its
schools _ and whether it can afford not to.

   Aberdeen (S.D.) American News on the minimum wage:
   When we first considered the minimum wage issue, we thought it
was obvious that the wage should be raised. After reading articles
from several sources, however, we discovered there is no easy
answer. ...
   An American Economics Association survey found that 90 percent
of its members agree that a minimum wage increase results in more
unemployment among young and unskilled workers.
   These jobs will be lost because employers will decide to have
fewer employees since their wages will be higher. ...
   The worst part of this situation is that those the higher wage
is intended to help _ those with the fewest job skills _ will be
the first to be unemployed. ...
   It is impossible to tell those earning minimum wage that they
are making enough money, but the decision may easily turn into a
choice between a low-paying job or no job. Either way, no one wins.

   The News-Review, Roseburg, Ore., on housing policies:
   There is ample evidence that Secretary Jack Kemp's Department of
Housing and Urban Development is fostering a new and important
spirit of cooperation with Congress. ...
   For instance, ... Kemp has expressed great interest in a
comprehensive housing bill introduced in the Senate earlier this
month with broad bipartisan support. ...
   HUD's new policies emphasize the importance of helping
low-income families to work actively toward solving their own
housing problems, rather than being the passive recipients of
federal largesse.
   Part of (Kemp's) master plan is the creation of federal
enterprise zones to attract businesses to poverty-stricken inner
cities and rural areas. ...
   Another important part of the overall housing plan is the
concept of urban homesteading, which enables people living in
public housing to buy their own homes. ...
   HUD is now working on a plan to provide temporary accommodation
for the homeless in unused federal buildings throughout the nation.
...
   These common-sense policies bring self-respect, dignity, and
above all, hope, to a section of the population which too often
finds itself trapped in a cycle of despair and poverty.

little thing who knew what he did was ``wrong but didn't know it

is the fall guy in the Contra case.
   While it's true that others are still to be tried, the top of
the administration, such as former President Ronald Reagan, has
wiggled out of it. The same might be said for President ... Bush,
who, while not a major villain in the case, apparently had some
involvement.
   (North) probably didn't know that his blind loyalty would leave
him holding the bag. But the choice was his and none of his
powerful friends will step forward to serve his time or pay his
fines if he is convicted.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Mexico's drug war:
   It's been nearly four years since the mutilated body of U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agent Enrique Camarena was found in a shallow
grave on a remote ranch 60 miles southeast of Guadalajara, Mexico.
   Overwhelming evidence suggests that ... Camarena's kidnapping,
torture and murder were masterminded by one Rafael Caro Quintero,
reputed to be the boss of one of Mexico's five largest drug
families. After many delays, the wheels of justice are about to
catch up with this notorious drug kingpin. ...
   Although the Mexican federal police considered him a prime
suspect in ... Camarena's death, ... Caro Quintero was permitted to
flee to Costa Rico four years ago after bribing the regional police
commander who headed the investigation.
   Even after he was captured and imprisoned, he was treated more
like a visiting dignitary than a dangerous felon. His prison cell
resembled a hotel suite, complete with room service and a telephone
with which to conduct his business. It was a travesty.
   The Mexican government, which has repeatedly vowed to crack down
on murderous drug dealers, can do just that by making an example of
... Caro Quintero _ provided he is convicted. ...
   Camarena's grieving family, which has been patiently waiting for
his killers to be punished, deserves at least that much.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on Mexico's corruption:
   Toppling one reputed Mexican drug kingpin will only be valuable
if it signals a long-term commitment by the Mexican government to
fight corruption and drugs. Otherwise, the names will simply change
as the status quo continues.
   It would clearly be in U.S. interests for Mexico to wage a
continued assault; a recent report by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III cited Mexico as the United States' top source for heroin
and its No. 2 source for marijuana.
   But it is in Mexico's interests as well _ not just to win
favorable treatment over international debts and such, but because
of the tremendous social and political costs of corruption. All
nations in which drugs have become big business must fear the sort
of stranglehold that drug traffickers achieved over the Colombian
government.
   Elements in the recent arrest of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo
offer the kinds of encouraging signs the United States has been
looking for from Mexico.
   In the past, Mexican government officials frequently have
responded testily to U.S. charges of official corruption in
connection with drug trafficking. But (last) week, several
officials were arrested, and Mexican Attorney General Enrique
Alvarez del Castillo discussed the corruption aspect.
   Mexico's president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has frequently
spoken out against drug trafficking.
   But one of Mexico's frequent responses to criticism has been
that it is the United States' consumer demand for drugs, especially
the popularity of cocaine, that drives the trafficking.
   In Mexico, it will take a great deal of political will _ and
skill _ for President Salinas' anti-corruption efforts to succeed
in the face of longtime practice. If they do work, however, they
will benefit both countries _ institutions and citizens alike.

   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on needle-exchange programs:
   (Baltimore) Mayor (Kurt) Schmoke was probably braced for a
pummeling when he told a Washington audience that he favored
experimental needle-exchange programs for drug addicts as a way of
slowing the spread of AIDS.
   Predictably, ... national drug director William J. Bennett
obliged by jumping on Schmoke's remarks with both feet.
   ``It very clearly muddies the message,'' Bennett said, because
it sends an ``ambiguous and ambivalent'' message about drug use.
   While that concern undoubtedly is widely shared, Bennett is
hardly the one to complain about officials sending ``mixed
messages.''
   As of last week he had not only snubbed D.C. Mayor Marion Barry
by not including him in the announcement of new federal anti-drug
efforts in the nation's capital, but also planned to exclude
Schmoke from a meeting of local officials called ... to discuss
overall policy in the Baltimore-Washington region.
   How Bennett expected to run an effective regional campaign
without the mayors of its two largest cities is anybody's guess.
Ultimately even he was forced to recognize the inconsistency of his
position and open the gathering to both Barry and Schmoke.

   The ugliness of fan hysteria in Britain and other countries
where soccer excites mindless rivalry contrasts sharply with the
wholesome youth soccer being developed in America.
   Here participants are many but spectators few and the big noise
on the sidelines is parents urging youngsters to greater toughness.
   Wrong decisions by police were the immediate cause of the
Sheffield disaster, but poor stadium design and bad spectator
habits were the larger culprits.

   The Milwaukee Journal on the British soccer tragedy:
   A soccer match, a time for recreation and merriment, instead
turned into a maelstrom, as nearly 100 persons were killed in the
crush of spectators at a match Saturday in Sheffield, England.
   The episode teaches important lessons about both the importance
and danger of sports, and it demonstrates the need for measures to
prevent a recurrence.
   It occurred as fans surged forward in overcrowded stands. The
victims were crushed and suffocated in a ``terrace,'' or
standing-room-only pen, at the end of the stadium. Thousands of
eager, excited fans had gathered at the stadium hoping to watch the
game. ...
   For too many Britons, sports is also something to fight about.
English soccer clubs were banned from European tournaments in 1985
after 39 people were killed in Belgium when backers of a British
team rioted during a match with an Italian team.
   If U.S. sports has been marred by drugs (and, now, possibly,
gambling), British soccer has been marred by violence.
   While hooliganism in the stands has been an occasional problem
during football, baseball and other games in this country, crowd
control is taken seriously by most big-time sports executives here,
as it should be. It obviously needs to be taken more seriously in
Britain.

   Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal on the British soccer tragedy:
   The carnage is senseless, and the immediate reaction to such
devastation is to seek out someone to blame.
   The finger has been pointed first at the guards who opened the
gates to the fans. Certainly hindsight raises questions about their
decision, although there is evidence that the decision was made out
of fear of a similar crunch at the turnstiles.
   England has demonstrated the ugly consequences when crowds get
out of hand.
   The lesson should serve as a reminder that patience is important
in wait-your-turn situations. It also should make officials
involved in such operations re-examine the way crowds are handled
and accommodated.
   It may save lives.

   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on Pentagon procurement:
   The conviction ... of two Teledyne Electronics executives for
their roles in the Pentagon procurement scandal sends a clear,
strong signal to other corporation officials: They will be held
accountable when they know about wrongdoing and allow it to
continue.
   The executives, found guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud, face
long prison sentences _ up to 40 years _ and large fines.
Prosecutors argued that the two were aware a consultant was paying
a Navy procurement official for inside information that led to
Teledyne landing a $24 million contract.
   The significance of the conviction, according to assistant U.S.
attorney Joseph Aronica, is that it tells executives ``they cannot
put things into motion and feign ignorance and attempt to wash
their hands of guilt.''
   Although the company itself already has agreed to pay $4.3
million in penalties, this kind of corruption can best be addressed
by holding the top people personally accountable. Shareholders end
up footing the bill for fines; prison time, however, is a real
attention-getter.

   Hattiesburg (Miss.) American on school drinking water:
   A report on the safety of school drinking water released last
week by the Environmental Protection Agency gives every one of us
reason for concern. Federal studies suggest that water from at
least 10 percent of faucets in each school contains high lead
levels; 20 parts per billion poses a health risk.
   What's more, the EPA said at least 1 million lead-contaminated
drinking fountains may be operating in U.S. schools _ some with up
to 400 times the amount of lead considered safe by the EPA.
   The culprits are old and new plumbing and drinking fountains
that are lead-lined or have lead solder. The danger is particularly
great in fountains or faucets that are used intermittenly and thus
allow the water to stand in the pipes, as in the case in schools.
The EPA is recommending that at least some of the fountains in
every school in the nation be tested. ...
   This is a potentially serious problem, but it is a problem that
can be dealt with. The answer lies in testing those fountains now
and taking quick action to remove any that reveal dangerous levels
of lead.

   Owatonna (Minn.) People's Press on smokers suing tobacco
companies:
   Smokers who die from lung cancer and their survivors may sue
tobacco companies, the Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled. ...
   That is not to say these suits have particular merit, however,
or that the plaintiffs should be awarded any damages.
   John Forster, 46, died of lung cancer in 1985, but not before
suing R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for causing his cancer.
   The truth of the matter is that John Forster had 25 years of
warnings before he finally died of cancer. ...
   R.J. Reynolds took certain actions that may have led to his
death, it's true. But so did John Forster. There is an element of
personal responsibility here.
   Perhaps it was not his fault that he became addicted. To be
sure, it is not his widow's fault. We would not deny him or his
family human compassion.
   But we cannot use lawsuits to vent our frustrations or anger at
the hand we are dealt in life, or the hand we draw.
   We make mistakes, and we live with them _ and sometimes, sadly,
we die with them.

   Members of a private commission that
recommended federal pay increases said Wednesday they are glad
President Bush has proposed a raise for judges but disappointed he
did not also call for more money for members of Congress and top
government officials.
   ``We were disappointed by what he decided to do right now,''
political scientist Norman Ornstein told the House Committee on
Post Office and Civil Service at a hearing on recommendations of
the National Commission on the Public Service.
   ``It is quite clear the president doesn't want to grapple with
the situation in the aftermath of what happened in January and
February,'' Ornstein said. ``He is trying to find ways simply not
to look at the mess right now.''
   Before leaving office in January, former President Reagan
approved a government commission's recommendation calling for a 50
percent increases for judges, members of Congress and high federal
officials. The proposal aroused a storm of public criticism and was
rejected by Congress in February.
   The private commission also recommended raises for all three
branches of government in a report submitted to Bush on March 29.
The president, however, proposed a 25 percent hike for judges only,
in an ethics proposal he unveiled April 12. He put off the question
of other increases.
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, now chairman of
the private commission, said, ``We welcome the president's
initiative in respect to raising the pay of federal judges. We
believe, however, that increases are essential for the other
branches as well.''
   ``Pay for the public servants of government must rank
substantially higher in the range of government's budget
priorities,'' Volcker told the committee.
   Ornstein said that on the basis of the commission's meeting with
Bush when they submitted their report he believed that ``before
long he will want to work out something that will cut across all
branches.''
   Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., chairman of the House committee,
said, ``While much debate has focused on the role which
compensation plays in the government's ability to recruit and
retain, the recommendations of the commission are much broader in
scope than a single plug for a pay raise for executives, judges or
anyone else.''
   Volcker told the committee that ``it would be a misreading of
our intention and conclusions to place undue emphasis on one area _
such as pay _ to the exclusion of others.''
   One of the most important things, he said, is a recommendation
that Cabinet officers and agency heads be given ``greater
flexibility to administer their organizations. ... In short, we
urge greater delegation of personnel authority and easier
procedures for hiring and firing.''
   The commission also called for ``a partial, but decisive,
reversal of the trend extending over many years for an increased
number of political appointees _ now standing at over 3,000'' in
the executive branch.

<HEAD>Fish Oil Lowers Mild High Blood Pressure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release at 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Large doses of fish oil can relieve mild high
blood pressure and may work as well as some commonly used
prescription drugs, a study concludes.
   Many claims have been made about the seeming benefits of fish
oil on the heart and circulatory system, but convincing data to
back up these beliefs have been scarce and many experts remain
dubious.
   The latest study, conducted on 32 white males, provides some of
the strongest evidence yet to support at least one of fish oil's
reputed merits.
   Fish oil seemed to work about as well as two mainstays of blood
pressure therapy _ diuretics and the beta-blocker drug propranolol.
   However, the amounts taken were much higher than the doses
usually suggested by manufacturers of widely advertised brands of
fish oil capsules. In fact, when taken at the recommended doses,
the oil did not change the subjects' blood pressure.
   Other studies have suggested that fish oil can prevent heart
disease by repairing damaged arteries, lowering dangerously high
cholesterol levels and slowing the blood's tendency to clot.
   Drs. Howard R. Knapp and Garrett A. FitzGerald, the researchers
who conducted the latest study at Vanderbilt University, have been
among fish oil skeptics.
   Both said they were surprised to find that it seemed to work.
But they cautioned that people should not exchange their blood
pressure pills for fish oil until doctors know more about its
effectiveness and safety.
   ``For the time being, we are taking a cautious approach and not
recommending it as a therapy for high blood pressure,'' Knapp said
in an interview. ``Certainly I wouldn't throw away my propranolol
and start taking fish oil instead.''
   At Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, Dr. Richard Pasternak said
doctors should wait for the results of several large studies now
under way before making up their minds about fish oil.
   However, he added, ``This research is consistent with other
experimental evidence, and this is an important break in that
regard.''
   ``Fish oil is not not the drug of choice for treating
hypertension, but the study shows that that dietary change can
markedly reduce our risk of high blood pressure,'' said Dr. Mark
Milner of Washington Hospital Center.
   According to the latest report, published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine, a month of fish oil lowered the men's
average blood pressure from the starting point of 139 over 94 to
132 over 90.
   However, to achieve this, they had to take three tablespoons of
herring oil daily. The oil, which caused belching and a lingering
fishy aftertaste, is not widely available because it spoils quickly.
   The amount taken is the equivalent of 50 fish oil gel capsules,
like those sold in supermarkets and drug stores. Knapp said taking
this many capsules is not practical because big doses of them often
cause stomach upset.
   The doctors also caution that people should not substitute cod
liver oil, which contains too much vitamin A and D and not enough
omega-3 fatty acids. Oily ocean fish, such as herring and mackerel,
are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the particular variety of fish oil
that appears to be good for the heart.
   The herring oil used in the study was about 30 percent omega-3.
The doctors noted that more concentrated kinds of fish oil are
becoming available that may allow people to get fish oil's benefits
while taking less.
   The latest research ``opens the possibility that this type of
therapy may ultimately find a place in the treatment of high blood
pressure,'' said FitzGerald. ``It's an important first step in that
direction.''
   The researchers cautioned that more study will also be needed to
see if fish oil lowers blood pressure for blacks and women as well
as for white men.

   West German media have stumbled
through an awkward observance of Adolf Hitler's birth 100 years
ago, reflecting a hesitance among many to come to grips with the
once-revered Fuehrer.
   The unsavory anniversary has been noted in a disjointed series
of newspaper portraits, historical analyses and opinion polls that
explain only pieces of the phenomenon that brought death for
millions during World War II and the Holocaust, and the enduring
division of Europe.
   One radio network in Hesse state planned a discussion of
residual right-wing extremist tendencies for Thursday's anniversary
of Hitler's birth in the Austrian village of Braunau, on West
Germany's southern border.
   But other media seemed more poised to react to expected
demonstrations by the neo-Nazi fringe than to put the occasion into
perspective for a nation still branded by crimes committed before
many people were born.
   The ZDF television network announced two months ago it would not
have any documentaries on the anniversary, which it said was ``not
the right day to remember a criminal.''
   Newspapers and magazines across the entire political spectrum
have made virtually no mention of plans by neo-Nazi leaders like
Michael Kuehnen to celebrate Hitler's centennial.
   Federal officials in the capital have been careful to avoid
discussion of the infamous occasion.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Michael-Andreas Butz was asked what
steps federal forces have taken to ensure the safety of potential
targets of neo-Nazi actions. ``We have taken adequate precautions
where needed,'' he replied, declining to elaborate.
   Among the press reviews of Hitler's role in German history, the
most comprehensive and critical analysis has been offered by Der
Spiegel magazine.
   The glossy weekly devoted its April 10 cover and 20 pages to try
to explain ``The terrorist of the century'' and how he has affected
today's Germany.
   Spiegel published in detail the results of a nationwide opinion
poll conducted in March by the respected Emnid Institute of
Bielefeld.
   Responses by the 2,200 West Germans polled indicated widespread
uncertainty about how to assess Hitler, as well as some worrisome
indications of latent anti-Semitism and positive views toward the
dictator.
   An astounding 38 percent of those polled replied ``yes'' to the
question: ``If not for the war and the Holocaust, would Hitler have
been a great German statesman?''
   The poll also revealed that 46 percent of the respondents, said
by the Emnid Institute to represent accurately West German voters,
consider the Third Reich to have had some positive influences.
   Asked to evaluate their attitude toward Jews in West Germany, 18
percent described their views as negative and 33 percent chose zero
on the scale that ranged from minus 5 for very negative attitudes
to plus 5 for very positive.
   The complex bundle of nationalist feelings carried by many West
Germans was illustrated by reaction to the statement ``I am proud
to be a German,'' to which only 27 percent of the respondents fully
agreed.
   The poll also suggested that most West Germans believe the
division of Germany is permanent, and that more than two thirds of
the respondents would like to be done with ``the past.''
   Quick, a weekly picture magazine, also carried a photo essay on
Hitler and his legacy, with similar poll results indicating strong
pockets of right-wing extremism in West Germany and substantial
numbers of citizens _ 18 percent _ who believe their nation was
better off under the Third Reich.
   Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported a few days earlier that
two West German journalists have written the first book since the
fall of the Nazi dictatorship to examine how the German press aided
Hitler's rise to power and his march through Europe.
   Other prominent newspapers carried recent articles by historians
and jurists recounting Hitler's dictatorship and contrasting it
with a recent rise in ultra-rightist politics.
   The left-leaning magazine Tempo reported Wednesday it had
learned of plans by extremists to break windows at Jewish-owned
businesses, send aloft a helium balloon emblazoned with the
forbidden swastika and to lay a wreath at the Moenchengladbach
birthplace of Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels.
   Tempo spokesman Carl-Eduard Meyer told The Associated Press the
magazine decided to report the details to alert possible victims,
not to inform would-be agitators.
   Austrian police prepared to seal off access to Hitler's
birthplace in the village of Braunau to prevent incidents.
   But Butz, the West German Interior Ministry spokesman, said
police reported only throngs of journalists at the scene as of
midday Wednesday.

   Calling for ``fresh thinking'' on resolving
the Middle East conflict, President Bush said today that he and
Jordan's King Hussein agreed to work toward the structuring of a
``serious negotiating process'' to achieve an Arab-Israeli
settlement.
   Bush issued the statement after a meeting of more than an hour
with Hussein.
   The two then traveled by helicopter to Mount Vernon, Va., for a
tour of the home of George Washington and a boat ride on the
Potomac River.
   With Hussein standing at his side, Bush said, ``His Majesty
committed Jordan to this task and I commit the United States to
this task.''
   ``The time has come to encourage fresh thinking, to avoid
sterile debate and to focus on the difficult but critical work of
structuring a serious negotiating process,'' he added.
   Bush said that during the meeting he reaffirmed his view that
``properly designed and mutually acceptable elections'' in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip could, as an initial step, help lead to
negotiations on the final status of the territories.
   He added that the United States remains committed to bringing
about a comprehensive settlement through negotiations based on U.N.
resolutions which establish the principle of peace for Israel in
return for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories.
   Hussein, in turn, praised the United States for opening a
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization and said that
this, coupled with the PLO's renunciation of terrorism last
December, had improved prospects for peace.
   He expressed hope for more flexibility on Israel's part.
   ``Peace can neither be negotiated nor achieved without PLO
participation,'' Hussein said.
   Both leaders expressed support for the concept of a United
Nations-sponsored conference on Middle East, with Bush emphasizing
the long-standing U.S. view that any such conference should
facilitate direct negotiations between the parties.
   Earlier, while the two posed for photographers in the Oval
Office, Hussein was asked whether the time is ripe for a
breakthrough in the peace process.
   ``I believe it is,'' he said. ``It's never been as ripe as now.''
   Before the talks, Bush was hopeful that Hussein would show
interest in an Israeli proposal for ending the negotiating impasse
through elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Asked whether his optimistic statements meant he was supporting
the Israeli plan, Hussein said, ``Not necessarily.''
   Later, a senior administration official said Hussein ``certainly
did not rject the idea'' of Palestinian elections in the occupied
territories.
   The official, who declined to be identified, said Hussein
expressed ``some concerns'' about the Israeli proposal but ``felt,
however, reassured and encouraged about the directions'' after Bush
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III explained the U.S.
approach.
   Jordan's role in the Middle East peace process has diminished
considerably since last summer, when Hussein severed administrative
and legal ties with Palestinians living in the West Bank.
   But a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on Tuesday said
Jordan's proximity to the West Bank makes a Jordanian role in
resolving the Palestinian issue inevitable.
   ``There is no way in the world that one can conceive of a peace
process moving forward without the active involvement of King
Hussein,'' said the official, insisting on anonymity.
   After a morning meeting with Bush and a luncheon with Vice
President Dan Quayle, Hussein was to be guest of honor at a White
House dinner tonight. Meetings with congressional leaders also were
on his schedule.
   Two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir proposed
during a visit here that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip elect representatives to negotiate with Israel on limited
self-government.
   The Bush administration has endorsed the proposal on the
condition that the elections lead to negotiations on the final
status of the two territories.
   The senior U.S. official said the proposal represents an attempt
to end the impasse in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``We're talking about trying to get things off dead center,
which is where we find the situation in the Middle East at the
present time,'' the official said. ``And we see, in the elections
proposal, depending on how it is developed and fleshed out, the
possibility of turning a situation from a conflict situation to one
of greater political dialogue.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has expressed support for
elections only if they are preceded by the withdrawal of Israeli
troops.
   The senior official described Hussein as a ``valued friend'' of
the United States and noted that the administration has proposed an
increase in military sales to Jordan from $10 million to $48
million next year. Economic assistance would rise from $15 million
to $35 million.
   Jordan administered the West Bank until 1967, when Israel seized
the territory during the Middle East war. But until last summer,
Jordan continued to play a dominant role in the area, paying the
salaries of thousands of municipal employees there and funding a
sizeable aid program.
   Hussein's decision to dismantle Jordan's ties with the West Bank
was widely interpreted as a challenge to the PLO, which has long
demanded total control of the territory.

   A cruise ship rammed into a
boardwalk, crunching a 35-foot section and damaging a waterside
restaurant.
   No injuries were reported in Tuesday's accident, which sent
dozens of people scrambling to safety.
   It was the second time in two months that a ship owned by Europa
Cruise Line Inc. was involved in an accident in the same area.
   ``There was mass hysterics,'' said Tom Murphy, who was sitting
with his family at the Fisherman's Landing restaurant when they saw
the ship headed for them. ``I said: Everybody, let's get out of
here,' and we just dove out of the way.''
   Seconds later, their corner table was crushed beneath pilings
and planks. The Europa Sun pulled away from the boardwalk and
docked safely within a few minutes.
   Europa officials said strong currents contributed to the crash,
just as they said currents contributed to a March 11 accident
involving the Sun's sister ship, the Europa Star. That accident
damaged a commercial fishing boat.
   The Coast Guard found no mechanical problems with the vessel and
allowed it to leave on an evening cruise a few hours later, Coast
Guard Lt. Charles Brantley said. An investigation should take about
a week, he said.

<HEAD>Third Bomb Found In Germany; Possible Link To Flight 103</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that a third
bomb has been found in the investigation of two alleged Palestinian
terrorists and that the case may be linked to the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103.
   The federal Parliament's news service said in a brief report
that the latest bomb discovered in the probe was hidden in a
television set in an apartment in the Duesseldorf suburb of Neuss.
   ``There is a possible connection between the bomb found
(Thursday) and the crash of the jet over the Scottish city of
Lockerbie on Dec. 21,'' the news report said without elaborating.
No one answered the telephone at the Parliament information office
tonight when the AP called for more details.
   The bomb was found by police in a followup search of the
apartment Thursday, said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the
federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe. But he said suggestions
linking the Palestinian case and the Pan Am bombing that killed 270
people are ``nothing but speculation.''
   The bomb discovered in the television set was seized from the
same apartment where two other explosive devices disguised to look
like electronics equipment were found last week, Prechtel said.
   One of those bombs, hidden in a radio, blew up Monday at the
Wiesbaden headquarters of the federal police force while two
disposal experts were trying to disarm it. Officer Hans-Juergen
Sonntag, 35, died of his injuries from the blast, and a 29-year-old
colleague who has not yet been publicly identified remained in
critical condition at a Frankfurt hospital today.
   An employee of the federal police force, the Bundeskriminalamt,
said there was no one available tonight to answer questions about
the case.
   The Palestinians, alleged members of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, were arrested in October
in what police called the biggest weapons bust in the nation's
history.
   British investigators probing the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland, have said the plane was blown up in the sky by plastic
explosives hidden in a radio-cassette player.
   A radio-bomb containing the same Czechoslovak-made plastic
explosives was among the weapons seized during the October raid,
and authorities confirmed that the bomb that blew up Monday also
appeared to have been hidden in a radio.
   The Pan Am investigation has been handled by West German
officials with extreme caution because of persistent British and
U.S. media reports saying that the bomb was planted on the aircraft
in Frankfurt.
   Asked about the Parliament news service report, Prechtel
disputed its suggestion that the probe of the two suspected agents
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command has turned up indications those suspects were involved with
the Lockerbie disaster.
   ``I know about that being said, but that is nothing but
speculation,'' he said. ``They can't say it's not connected, so
they speculate that it is. But we have no evidence that it is
connected to Lockerbie _ only the theoretic possibility exists.''
   Police arrested 14 suspects in the October raids but only two,
Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni and Abdul Fattah Ghandanfar, remain in
custody.
   Prechtel said authorities expected to file charges against the
two within a few months. They are suspected of forming terrorist
cells in West Germany, illegal possession of weapons and bomb
attacks on U.S. military trains in August 1987 and April 1988,
Prechtel said.

<TEXT>
   Security forces this year have caught 300
mainland Chinese who sneaked into Taiwan in search of a better
life, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
   Lt. Gen. Lee Chen-lin, deputy chief of the armed forces general
staff, told the lawmaking Legislative Yuan all of the Chinese were
sent back to China on fishing boats they used to enter Taiwan after
officials determined they weren't spies.
   Most of the Chinese were caught after authorities received
reports from villagers of suspicious strangers, he said.
   On Tuesday, police reported the arrest of 58 Chinese who said
they came to Taiwan to look for jobs.
   Taiwan is suffering from an acute labor shortage, and a worker
can earn the equivalent of $555 a month, compared with about $25 in
China.
   Lee said there also has been an increase in the number of
Chinese fishing boats that have entered Taiwan's territorial waters
since July 1987 when the Nationalist government ended 38 years of
martial law.
   The Nationalists, defeated in a civl war on the China mainland
in 1949, are technically still at war with the Communists.

<TEXT>
   Some victims of a clash between Georgian
protesters and Soviet troops were poisoned by an ``unknown chemical
substance,'' the official government daily Izvestia reported today.
   Izvestia quoted a commission investigating the April 9 clash,
which left at least 20 pro-independence demonstrators dead in the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi.
   The report followed widespread allegations that poison gas was
used to crush the demonstration.
   The Georgian health minister, Irakliy Menagarishvili, told
Izvestia the country's leading toxicologists believed the substance
used on protesters had ``an irritating and atropine-like effect.''
   Atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid that in large doses
can induce nerve paralysis and delirium. It can cause death through
combined cardiac and respiratory failure.
   But a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri Gremitskikh, asked at a
briefing today whether nerve gas was used, said that was impossible
because it is a ``combat weapon.''
   Izvestia did not specify how many of 138 patients still
hospitalized Tuesday had symptoms of poisoning, nor did it say if
any of the deaths were caused by chemicals.
   Georgian activists claim several people have died from the
effects of poison gas. They also allege military authorities
refused to identify the substance or tell doctors how to treat
affected patients.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda quoted an Interior Ministry
official today as saying soldiers used tear gas in the clashes. It
said the official, who was not identified, made the acknowledgement
on Georgian state television.
   ``Unfortunately, this crucial admission came several days late
and was made only after the level of passions had reached the
highest degree,'' Pravda said.
   But Pravda also quoted a military spokesman as saying troops
could not have used tear gas because it is not part of their
standard equipment.
   Six newly elected deputies to the Congress of People's Deputies
called today for the Soviet Union to develop better laws to control
troops and public officials to prevent a repeat of the tragedy.
   The six, whose joint letter was published in the weekly Moscow
News, had just returned from a trip to Georgia.
   Under the headline, ``What has happened once should not be
repeated,'' the letter called for material gathered by a commission
investigating the incident to be released to the new Congress of
People's Deputies, which meets for the first time May 25.
   The commission's findings could become ``the basis for laws that
truly, genuinely, will be defending perestroika,'' it said,
referring to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform drives.
   The deputies also criticized the strict censorship that was
imposed on journalists in Tbilisi.
   ``Why and by whom is the decision always taken that at moments
of sharp confrontations, it's appropriate to turn off glasnost,
just like you turn off the electricity when there's an emergency?''
the letter asked.
   Foreign reporters have been barred from Georgia since the clash.
   The deputies accused officials of covering up soldiers' use of
gas. They also said local leaders failed to adequately warn
protesters that troops were about to move in, and failed to brief
soldiers on how to behave.
   The deputies, all elected from the Union of Cinema Workers, are
Mikhail Belikov, Boris Vasiliev, Alexander Gelman, Dmitry Lunkov,
Eldar Shengelaya and Yegor Yakovlev, the editor in chief of Moscow
News.

   Striking workers and radical students
fought police in at least 10 cities Wednesday and protesters in
Seoul threw a score of firebombs into a U.S. military base.
   Thousands of students hurled rocks and firebombs at police on
the anniversary of a student uprising April 19, 1960, that brought
down the authoritarian government of President Syngman Rhee.
   Police responded by firing tear gas at waves of student shouting
for the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and ``Yankee go home!''
   News reports from Changwon, a southern industrial city, said
about 10,000 workers rallied at three factories and many responded
with firebombs and bricks when police stopped a march by 5,000
strikers.
   Confrontations between riot police and students opposed to Roh's
government were reported at 13 schools in Seoul. Police charged
into attacking crowds and made arrests during hit-ant-run battles
after nightfall.
   Authorities said more than 40,000 students demonstrated on the
anniversary at colleges and universities around the country, but
did not say how many observances became violent.
   Several injuries of protesters and police were seen in Seoul.
Police said they had no figures on injuries and arrests.
   Before dawn Wednesday, protesters hurled about 20 firebombs into
Camp Isabell, a U.S. Army storage facility in eastern Seoul.
American military officials reported minor damage.
   Students attack U.S. facilities to dramatize demands for the
withdrawal of the 43,000 American troops based in South Korea under
a mutual defense pact.
   The government had put police on top alert to block anniversary
protests. At least 20,000 riot officers were deployed in Seoul.
   Radical students, a small but vocal minority, are trying to make
an alliance with militant workers to oust the Roh government, but
lack broad public support because of their extreme views.
   Government officials have said strikes threaten to disrupt
economic and political stability. Labor unrest has spread to nearly
all industries in recent weeks and the government says it will use
military personnel to keep vital industries running if necessary.
   Dozens of labor activists have been arrested since a crackdown
on violent labor actions began last week. Officials accused
militant unions of trying to create a general strike for higher pay.
   At least 59 militant unions in Seoul decided on Wednesday to
call a joint strike Friday in protest of the crackdown on labor.
Union leaders said they would seek an alliance with students.
   Roh, a former general inaugurated in February 1988, has
introduced broad democratic reforms but dissidents associated his
government with the authoritarian regime of Chun Doo-hwan, another
general who preceded him.

   The nephew of a Protestant
militant who turned police informer was found shot to death today,
and gunmen seriously wounded a Roman Catholic man in another part
of city, police said.
   Authorities declined to speculate on whether the attacks were
linked, and no group immediately claimed responsibility for them.
   A passerby found the body of Francis Galbraith on the edge of
Victoria Park near the shipyards of East Belfast, police said. He
had gunshot wounds in the head. Galbraith, 29, was a nephew of Joe
Bennett, a former high-ranking officer in the outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force, police said.
   Bennett, who left Northern Ireland after turning state's
evidence against 16 suspected paramilitary associates in 1983, is
serving a prison sentence in England for armed robbery. Fourteen of
the men were convicted on a range of charges including murder, but
all were freed on appeal.
   Police said the shooting of the 24-year-old Catholic man by two
unidentified gunmen in a side street off north Belfast's Antrim
Road bore the hallmarks of an attack by militant Protestants. The
victim was not identified.

   A newspaper said today that the army
commander opposed a call by Christian parliamentarians to halt
weeks of fighting between Moslem and Christian gunners.
   Battles raged through the night. However, no new casualties were
reported from the exchanges between Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000
Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   By police count, 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded
since the current round of hostilities broke out March 8.
   The French navy ship Rance, carrying 78 wounded in the Lebanon
fighting, arrived in Larnaca, Cyprus, today. The casualties were
being flown from Cyprus to Paris for treatment.
   French sailors carried the wounded down a gangplank to
ambulances. The patients, lying under white sheets, crossed their
arms over their eyes to block the brilliant Mediterranean sunshine.
   ``I was sitting at home and a shell just smashed into our
house,'' said Hammed Khalil, a 22-year-old student from Beirut
University College. He suffered a fractured shoulder.
   In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand was calling world
leaders in an effort to generate international pressure for a
cease-fire.
   Mitterrand spoke Tuesday with President Bush, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of Britian, President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria
and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He planned to speak later
today with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain.
   France has encouraged U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to make a trip to Syria or Tunisia to negotiate a
cease-fire, officials said.
   The French take a special interest in Lebanon because they ruled
it from the end of World War I until independence in 1943.
   In Beirut, a police spokesman said an unidentified assailant
fired a rocket-propelled grenade overnight at the residence of
Christian parliamentary deputy Edmond Rizk in Christian east Beirut.
   The grenade damaged Rizk's apartment, but no casualties were
reported, said the spokesman.
   The attack came a few hours after Rizk, a Maronite, read a
statement issued by 23 Christian legislators demanding a cease-fire.
   It did not set a deadline for the proposed truce but said Aoun's
army would be ``responsible for implementing it in areas under its
control...and the Syrian army would be responsible for implementing
it in its areas of deployment and control.''
   Beirut's daily paper An-Nahar, in a front-page report, said Aoun
opposed the cease-fire. Aoun was quoted as saying in response to
Rizk's statement: ``The people are best represented by the people.
Ask the people.''
   An-Nahar said Aoun, a 53-year-old Maronite, believes that
parliamentary deputies ``do not represent the people.''
   Lebanon's unicameral 99-seat house was elected in 1972 for a
four-year term. The civil war, which erupted in 1975, has prevented
parliamentary elections, and only 75 of the seats are filled.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet
in Lebanon's dual government, welcomed the statement by the
Christian parliamentarians, saying he hoped it ``would lead to
further positive steps.''
   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet, has rejected several
cease-fire appeals because they did not include direct reference to
Syria's 40,000 troops as a main party to the present conflict.
   An-Nahar said Aoun ``insists that the battle is against
Damascus.''
   A Christian government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Aoun was prepared to ``accept a security committee
to oversee a cease-fire only if it included a Syrian
representative.''
   The cease-fire call also was rejected by the Lebanese Forces
alliance of right-wing Christian militias.
   ``One cannot compare between freedom and humiliation,'' the
militia said in a statement. ``Our right in regaining our freedom
and sovereignty is sacred.''
   The latest battles broke out shortly after Aoun ordered a
blockade of Moslem militia-run ports.

   Fairfax County officials hope a plan to
offer free rent to police who agree to live in public housing
projects will help fight drug activity in the units.
   Housing officials fear a crackdown on drug dealers in nearby
Washington, D.C., will drive illegal drug trade into the county.
``We saw the increased drug activity in the district and were
concerned about the spillover into our public housing,'' said Mary
A. Stevens, spokeswoman for the county housing department.
   ``Several months ago, we felt the need to develop a program.
This is an ongoing response, and if we can think of something good
tomorrow, we'll add it to our list,'' she added Tuesday. She said
at least one police officer has moved into one of the 900 public
housing units.
   The housing authority began hiring off-duty officers in October
to patrol the grounds of the projects, at a cost through February
of $38,000. Housing officials have asked the county supervisors to
approve $250,000 to hire more off-duty officers and improve
security around the complexes.

   Dame Daphne du Maurier, who became one of the
century's most popular writers by mixing romance and the
supernatural in ``Rebecca'' and other novels, died today. She was
81.
   Monty Baker-Munton, a family friend, trustee and executor, said
he did not know the cause of death. ``For the last fortnight (two
weeks) she'd just been in a gentle decline,'' he said.
   The author, who also wrote such popular classics as
``Frenchman's Creek'' and ``The Birds,'' died in her sleep at her
home in the village of Par, in Cornwall, southwest England,
Baker-Munton told The Associated Press.
   Baker-Munton said that at the novelist's request, her funeral
would be private, with no memorial service or flowers and only
close family and friends attending. He said the venue was not being
disclosed.
   He said she would be cremated.
   Widowed in 1965, Mrs. du Maurier for many years lived a secluded
existence on the wild Cornish coast that inspired the settings for
many of her works.
   She remained fit enough until a few weeks ago to take her dog
for daily walks at the beach.
   Friendly and kind to her neighbors, she shunned publicity.
   ``She was a wonderful person with a great sense of fun. She
never took herself too seriously. There was no grandeur about her
famousness,'' said Baker-Munton's wife, Maureen, who knew her 44
years.
   ``I can't say I really like people,'' Mrs. du Maurier once
remarked. ``Perhaps that's why I always preferred to create my own
instead of mixing with real ones.''
   She spent the better part of her life producing bestsellers in
Menabilly, the mansion on the Cornish coast where the family lived.
   Many of her novels were filmed, including ``The Birds,''
directed by Alfred Hitchcock. But she herself waited until the age
of 64 before consenting to face a television interviewer.
   Born in London on May 13, 1907, Daphne du Maurier was one of
three daughters of the renowned actor Sir Gerald du Maurier.
   She was educated by private tutors in Paris and at age 21
published her first articles and short stories. Her publisher told
her: ``Write a novel,'' so she produced ``The Loving Spirit'' in
1931.
   The novel captivated a young British army major and led to a
storybook courtship.
   The officer, Frederick A. M. Browning, resolved to meet the
author and journeyed to Par to find her. They met in 1932, married
a few months later, and in the same year she published her second
novel, ``I'll Never Be Young Again.'' She was just 25.
   ``It was rather woman's magazine-y,'' she remarked afterward.
   ``Jamaica Inn,'' another hit, followed in 1936, and then came
``Rebecca,'' her most famous work. Published in 1938, it became an
instant hit, was turned into a film by Hitchcock starring Laurence
Olivier and Joan Fontaine, and was reprinted 39 times, selling more
than 1 million copies in hard cover alone.
   The story is about a young woman who marries an enigmatic
widower and moves to his large country house, where she discovers
that mystery surrounds his first wife's death. Trying to solve the
mystery against the wishes of a sinister housekeeper, she is drawn
into a terrifying psychological labyrinth.
   Histories, biographies, two plays and more novels followed, and
altogether six of her novels were filmed.
   Browning became commander of British Airborne Forces in World
War II and then treasurer to Prince Philip, husband of Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Lady Browning, as she became known when her husband was made a
lord, wrote much of her work at Menabilly, the ancient Georgian
manor the couple rented.
   Menabilly inspired Manderley, the name of the mansion in
``Rebecca.'' Oliver Cromwell's troops gutted the house during the
English Civil War, and legend had it that a cavalier was bricked up
alive in one of Menabilly's gray stone buttresses.
   Her favorite hideaway was a gardener's hut, where, she said,
``I'd sit for hours on end, chain-smoking, chewing mints and
tapping away at my typewriter.''
   Angular, sharp-eyed, usually wearing slacks and sweaters, she
would prowl the grounds of Menabilly or answer stacks of fan mail.
   After her husband died in 1965, she lived alone at Menabilly
except for two Yorkshire terriers. Her son and two daughters
visited frequently.
   In 1969 the queen made her a Dame Commander of the Order of the
British Empire, entitling her to call herself Dame Daphne.
   That year she had to leave Menabilly when its owner returned,
and she rented Kilmarth, her home in Par. There she wrote ``The
House on the Strand.''
   Menabilly still stands and is inhabited.
   In 1971 she published ``Not After Midnight,'' a collection of
five novellas containing her special mix of romance and the eerie.
   In 1981 she published an autobiography, ``Growing Pains.''

   King Mswati III celebrated his 21st

and topping the day off at a party complete with a 2,750-pound
birthday cake.
   As the young king emerged from his limousine at Somhlolo
National Stadium, the crowd of 60,000 gasped, then cheered at his
garb. Mswati wore a purple suit with polka-dot sleeves and black
hat, instead of the traditional leopard-skin loincloth and red
feather in his hair.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, who had attended Mswati's
coronation in 1986, delivered a congratulatory speech and sat next
to the young monarch and his wives at the stadium.
   Representatives of 20 other African nations also attended and
were invited to a party afterward at the Lozitha Royal Palace,
which featured the huge cake that was able to feed 4,000 people.
   In his speech, King Mswati congratulated South Africa, Angola
and Cuba for their agreement providing for withdrawal of foreign
troops from Angola and independence for Namibia.
   He said he would seek to implement his country's long-standing
policies of good neighborliness and non-interference in the
internal affairs of other countries, and said he was praying that
God would give him wisdom to rule the 6,946-square-mile nation of
750,000 people located between South Africa and Mozambique.

<HEAD>Seven Detainees Freed in South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven prominent anti-apartheid
leaders detained for almost three years without charge were
released today from a prison in the southern city of Port Elizabeth.
   Some of them were taken into custody at the beginning of the
current state of emergency in June 1986, and the rest were detained
later that year. All had joined hunger strikes by detainees earlier
this year.
   Among those released today were the Rev. Sipho Gogola of the
Interdenominational Ministers Association of Southern Africa; Lulu
Johnson, former president of the Congress of South African
Students; and Denis Neer, an official with the Congress of South
African Trade Unions.
   All seven have held top positions in anti-apartheid groups
around Port Elizabeth, one of the most militant black areas in the
country. However, the highest-ranking opposition leaders in the
area remain in detention.
   Since detainees began a hunger strike in January, the government
says it has freed more than 800 people detained without charge and
that less than 100 remain imprisoned.
   The government said previously that all emergency detainees had
given up their hunger strikes. There was no way to independently
confirm that report.
   More than 400 of the released detainees have been placed under
restriction orders limiting their activities, according to human
rights groups.
   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been held
without charge for varying lengths of time under the state of
emergency.
   The anti-apartheid activists are fighting a system that
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs. The country's 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration should create a
special agency to steer high-priority energy projects, such as
power plant or pipeline construction, around legal and regulatory
obstacles, an energy organization said Wednesday.
   In a broad assessment of American energy prospects, the United
States Energy Association said the special agency could enhance the
nation's energy security by eliminating what it called
unnecessarily long lead times for major projects.
   It said the agency could be fashioned along the lines of the
energy mobilization board proposed by then-President Carter as part
of a 1979 energy program. The board was never created.
   Jack Bowen, first vice chairman of the energy association, said
in presenting the proposal to the group's annual meeting that a
mobilization board would enable project developers to sidestep
unnecessary legal and regulatory obstacles.
   ``What it means is that no one can kill you with regulatory
delays,'' he said. ``It goes up or down on its merits. The lawyers
may not like it, but it's something we've got to do.''
   Bowen's group is comprised of about 100 private and public
energy-related organizations whose members represent virtually
every segment of the energy industry.
   Among the group's other recommendations:
   _Develop an integrated national energy strategy.
   _Increase energy conservation, encourage greater energy
efficiency and expand the use of renewable energy sources.
   _Increase domestic oil and natural gas production and increase
the use of natural gas and coal as a means of reducing the nation's
reliance on foreign oil.
   _Encourage the construction of nuclear power plants.
   Henson Moore, the Energy Department's deputy secretary, said in
a speech to the association that the department was moving to
fashion a comprehensive energy strategy but that it might not be
ready by the target date of April 1990.

   The State Department condemned the
assassination of El Salvador's attorney general on Wednesday as a
``brutal, despicable killing'' and charged that the act was
designed to provoke further violence.
   ``We condemn this terrorism,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   The official, Roberto Garcia Alvarado, was assassinated by
unidentified assailants as he drove to his office in the capital of
San Salvador. A bomb was placed on the roof of Garcia's Jeep
Cherokee when it stopped at a traffic light.
   Although Ms. Tutwiler noted no one had claimed responsiblity for
the attack, she said leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed
government have ``engaged in many acts of terror in recent months.''
   ``This brutal, despicable killing follows by five days the
bombing attack upon the home of Vice President-elect (Francisco)
Merino,'' Ms. Tutwiler said, adding that bombing injured a child in
the home.
   Ms. Tutwiler said such attacks amounted to ``a campaign of
terror against the people and democratic instutitions of El
Salvador.
   ``We condemn this terror, as should all civilized peoples and
nations. This campaign is clearly designed to provoke a violent
reaction,'' she said.

failure to fie currency reports and violating arms export
regulations.
   Cole, a self-described financial consultant, also pleaded guilty
to attempting to launder $2 million in cash he was waiting to pick
up at Philadelphia International Airport when he was arrested Dec.
1.
   The government, in return for Cole's agreement to cooperate with
the investigation and testify, dropped charges of money laundering
and interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
   U.S. District Judge Jan E. DuBois did not set a date for
sentencing.
   Also charged in the case are: Bahrudin Bijedic, the Yugoslav
consul general in Chicago; Vjekoslov Spanjol, a naturalized U.S.
citizen from Plano, Texas; Vinko Mir of New York, chairman of the
board of LBS Bank of New York Inc., the U.S. branch of a major
Yugoslav bank; and the bank itself.
   The defendants are charged for their alleged participation in a
scheme to launder $1.4 million supplied by undercover agents posing
as mobsters in 1987 and 1988. Bijedic allegedly supplied consular
seals that prohibited officials from examining bundles of cash.
   On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asked that a
federal judge privately review surveillance tapes of conversations
between Bijedic, Mir and Spanjol. Thornburgh argued that public
disclosure of the tapes would harm national security since they
contained ``sensitive information concerning United States
intelligence sources and methods.''
   In December, Cole and Spanjol were denied bail after prosecutors
played a tape recording made by an undercover customs agent in
which Cole boasted of his ability to tap into the computers of
defense contractors.
   Cole also described Spanjol as the second-ranking Yugoslavian
intelligence agent in the United States.

<HEAD>Ladies' Night Promotions Are Discriminatory, Iowa High Court Rules</HEAD>

   Ladies' nights, which offer women
reduced prices to attract business, violate laws against sex
discrimination, the Iowa Supreme Court said Wednesday.
   Although the ruling was based on a promotion at a greyhound
racing track, legal experts said the ruling could have major
implications for restaurants, theaters and other businesses that
offer discounts to members of one sex.
   The high court ordered the reinstatement of a lawsuit against
Bluffs Run, a Council Bluffs dog racing track.
   ``By giving women free admission and discounted prices on
concessions, Bluffs Run discriminated against men in the furnishing
of its facilities and services,'' the court said in its unanimous
opinion.
   The Iowa West Racing Association, operator of Bluffs Run,
offered a ``Ladies' Day'' promotion every Wednesday from June to
September 1987. Women received free admission into the grandstand
and got discounted prices on food, drinks and souvenirs.
   A track customer, Charles Ladd, sued the track after he was
refused the same discounts. He sought an injunction forcing the
track to halt Ladies Night promotions, but it resisted.
   Track officials argued that the promotions were simply to
attract business. They said Ladd wasn't denied services but simply
required to pay the normal price.
   The high court dismissed that reasoning, saying lawmakers were
clearly trying to ban unfair discrimination and courts should
interpret that broadly. It conceded that the intent of the
promotions wasn't to discriminate.
   ``We can conceive of no way to differentiate between an
accidentally discriminatory promotional scheme and a prohibited
discriminatory practice without eviscerating the statute,'' the
court said.
   The Iowa high court said other states have addressed the issue.
Such promotions have been banned in California and allowed in
Illinois, it noted.
   A spokeswoman at the Council Bluffs track said Wednesday no one
was available to comment on the decision.
   Women's rights activists praised the decision.
   ``If we want to be equal, we've got to pay our way,'' said state
Rep. Minnette Doderer, D-Iowa City.
   Lawrence Pope, a Drake University law professor, said the ruling
could be applied to ``theaters, restaurants, all kinds of places.''

   Abbie Hoffman's brother, insisting the
1960s radical's death was an accident rather than suicide, headed a
peace march and memorial service today in the family's native city.
   Folk singer Pete Seeger helped lead the festive noon march by at
least 250 people holding white dove placards and singing ``Down by
the Riverside.'' The march spanned four blocks from the Hoffmans'
childhood home to the service at Temple Emanuel, which the activist
attended as a child.
   On arrival at the synagogue, the marchers were met by nearly
1,000 people who filled the building, with the overflow listening
outside via loudspeakers.
   Seeger opened the service with a reprise of ``Down by the
Riverside,'' changing the first line to ``Abbie's spirit is living
still.''
   Jack Hoffman, 49, wore what he called his brother's most prized
possession, a green Boston Celtics jacket, and among the marchers
was Hoffman's close friend, basketball star Bill Walton.
   A coroner said Wednesday that Hoffman, 52, died from a
combination of drugs and alcohol. He was found dead at his home
near New Hope, Pa., on April 12.
   ``I just think he took a little too many (pills) and he took a
good slug of booze,'' Jack Hoffman said after hearing the coroner's
ruling. ``My brother had a very strong love and affection for me
and he wouldn't have left me alone like this.''
   Friends began gathering on the front porch of the Hoffman home
this morning, including Eron Kay, a Yippie who made a name for
himself by throwing pies in faces of public officials, and Jay
Severan, a Republican political consultant who had come from New
York City.
   ``Abbie was my hero.'' said Severan, in a gray suit and
overcoat. ``He was the first and best media consultant I ever
knew.''
   A balding Jerry Rubin, also wearing a gray suit, said before the
march, ``I feel very sad of course. But Abbie's spirit lives on.
Abbie was an unbelievable person.''
   ``I think Abbie's beliefs will prevail,'' said Rubin, who like
Hoffman was one of the Chicago Seven defendants. ``What Abbie
believed in the '80s was empowerment. Too bad he won't be around to
see it.''
   ``Abbie was a man who had guts,'' said Kay, attired in tie-dyed
T-shirt, with a Yippie pin stuck in his hat, knit of
rainbow-colored wool. ``He was a true patriot.''
   Kay also said he found it hard to accept a coroner's ruling that
Hoffman died of an overdose of barbituates mixed with alcohol.
   ``It's the same line they gave for Jimi Hendrix and Janis
Joplin,'' he said.
   Coroner Thomas Rosko said the autopsy uncovered the residue of
about 150 pills, several times the lethal dose even without the
presence of alcohol. In addition, Rosko said, Hoffman's blood
alcohol level was .20, twice the legal limit in Pennsylvania.
   ``I think it is likely that he literally fell asleep and died in
his sleep. Other than that, what occurred in his last hours is
strictly speculation,'' the coroner said.
   Phenobarbital is a long-acting sedative and an anticonvulsant.
   But Jack Hoffman denied his brother was suicidal, despite having
earlier admitted that founder of the Yippie movement had been
showing signs of disenchantment in recent months.
   Hoffman was a manic-depressive who often washed down medication
with whiskey, his brother said.
   ``Abbie, as many of you know, was somewhat careless with pills
and we always warned him about this kind of thing,'' he said.
   Hoffman said the family has received hundreds of letters,
telegrams and condolence calls from friends, entertainers and even
foreign embassies, but declined to identify individuals.
   Abbie Hoffman rose to prominence with the Chicago Seven, a group
of radicals tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the 1968
Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
   He went underground in 1974 to avoid trial on cocaine possession
charges and emerged nearly seven years later, saying he had lived
in upstate New York and undergone plastic surgery.

   Oscar-winning singer Carly Simon will open an
art gallery May 2 with a benefit exhibition featuring three of her
favorite artists.
   Riverrun Gallery, which shares its name with Simon's recent hit
single ``Let The River Run,'' will donate funds from the opening to
the Hazelden Foundation in Minneapolis and the Association to
Benefit Children in New York.
   Hazelden is a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation center;
ABC takes care of children who are homeless or afflicted with AIDS.
   The gallery in Manhattan is expected to put on four shows per
year, said Gina Silvester, one of two friends working with Simon on
Riverrun. The debut exhibition will feature artists from Martha's
Vineyard, where Simon has a home.
   ``The concept for the first show is Carly Simon's. These are the
artists she's collected for 10 years,'' said Silvester. ``This
gives them a chance for a New York City exhibition.''
   Simon captured an Academy Award last month for ``Let The River

<HEAD>Kasparov Wins Adjourned Game, Moves a Half-Point Behind Ljubojevic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov won
his adjourned 16th round game Wednesday in the Chess World Cup and
closed to a half-point of the leader, Ljubomir Ljubojevic of
Yugoslavia, with one round left.
   In the endgame, Kasparov, playing black, outmaneuvered Spanish
grandmaster Miguel Illescas. Facing an unstoppable checkmate,
Illescas resigned.
   With the 17th and final round scheduled for Thursday, Ljubojevic
has 10{ points out of a possible 15 and may become the first player
in 7{ years to score more points than Kasparov in a competition.
   Kasparov, 26, is in second place with 10 points. Another Soviet
grandmaster, Valery Salov, is third with 9{ points.
   ``Before the tournament the big question was whether Kasparov
would put in a wonderful performance and push his rating above
Bobby Fischer to become the highest ranked player in history,''
said Leontxo Garcia, a Spanish chess commentator. ``Now the
question is whether Kasparov will be able to catch Ljubojevic.''
   In the final round, Ljubojevic, 38, will play with the
disadvantageous black pieces against British grandmaster Nigel
Short, the third-ranked player in the world, while Kasparov will
face off with white against former world champion Boris Spassky of
France.
   But Kasparov is likely to face difficulties in facing Spassky,
who has the reputation of one of the hardest players to defeat. A
win scores one point and a draw a half point.
   The World Cup, a series of six tournaments held over two years
featuring a prize fund of $1.2 million, is regarded as the second
most important event in chess after the individual world
championship.
   Each of 25 eligible grandmasters plays in four of the six
competitions. The Barcelona event is fourth in the cycle.
   Kasparov won the second and thrid events in Belfort, France, and
Iceland, and is leading the competition. Former world champion
Anatoly Karpov, who won the first tournament in Brussels, Belgium,
is in second place.
   If Kasparov defeats Spassky and Ljubojevic only draws with
Short, they will tie for first place in the tournament.
   But a draw in his game Thursday will be enough to give
Ljubojevic a victory in the separate World Cup points table,
because Illescas is only competing in Barcelona as a representative
of the host country and is not eligible for the World Cup.
   When the World Cup calculations are made, all results against
Illescas will be taken out. Ljubojevic, who drew Illescas in the
eighth round, will have a half-point deducted from his final score,
and Kasparov will lose a whole point.
   Kasparov has trailed in Barcelona from the start. He scored only
two draws in his first three games, going down in the third round
to Soviet grandmaster Artur Yusupov.
   In the other game completed Wednesday, Alexander Belyavsky of
the Soviet Union defeated U.S. grandmaster Yasser Seirawan.
   The final round will feature a battle between Salov, 24, and
Viktor Korchnoi, a 58-year-old Soviet defector who plays for
Switzerland. Korchnoi is fourth with nine points, a half-point
behind Salov.

<HEAD>Bush, Hussein Agree to Work on Mideast Negotiating Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein
agreed Wednesday to strive for ``a serious negotiating process''
for Middle East peace, and the United States said the monarch did
not reject an Israeli proposal for Palestinian elections in the
West Bank and Gaza.
   After the two leaders talked for more than an hour at the White
House, the administration expressed satisfaction over Hussein's
statment to Bush that ``I fully support you and all your efforts.''
   Hussein's visit marked the end of the first round of Middle East
diplomacy for Bush, following talks earlier this month with Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   As he had done with the two others, Bush played tour guide for
the king.
   He took Hussein by helicopter to Mount Vernon, Va., to visit the
home of George Washington overlooking the Potomac River. They
returned to the capital on a yacht confiscated from drug merchants
and now owned by the Navy.
   Standing alongside Hussein in a Rose Garden ceremony, Bush said,
``The time has come to encourage fresh thinking, to avoid sterile
debate and to focus on the difficult but critical work of
structuring a serious negotiating process.
   ``His majesty committed Jordan to this task and I commit the
United States to this task,'' Bush said.
   The administration said the next step was to develop Shamir's
proposal for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied
territories to elect representatives to negotiate with Israel on
limited self-government.
   The United States has endorsed the proposal on the condition
that the elections lead to negotiations on the final status of the
territories.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Ned Walker told Congress
that the United States wants a timetable from Israel by July for
the elections.
   But he said that ``serious difficulties'' remain over what kind
of elections would be held and which Palestinians would agree to
take part.
   Walker said it should not matter to Israel whether candidates
are card-carrying members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Shamir has ruled out negotiating with the PLO, which he holds
responsibile for the violence that has wracked the occupied
territories.
   ``It shouldn't matter what the labels are,'' Walker told the
House foreign operations subcommittee, as long as the participants
are willing to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict with Israel.
   In his public remarks, Bush said that ``properly designed and
mutually acceptable elections could, as an initial step, contribute
to a political process leading to negotiations on the final status
of the West Bank and Gaza.''
   Bush also reiterated his guarded support for an international
peace conference as a step toward direct negotiations.
   Hussein did not publicly mention the Israeli election proposal,
but a senior administration official said, ``He certainly did not
reject the idea.''
   The official, who declined to be named, said Hussein expressed
``some concerns'' about the elections.
   The official said, however, that the king felt ``reassured and
encouraged about the directions after having heard the president
and secretary (of State James A. Baker III) explain our approach.''
   The official said Hussein said he would ``try to work with
others in order to ensure that ideas which could advance the
prospects for peace in the Middle East were not dismissed
prematurely.'' The PLO said any elections must be preceded by the
withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories.
   In his remarks, Hussein praised the United States for beginning
a dialogue with the PLO late last year.
   ``I hope this will prompt Israel to respond similarly to the
requirements of peace and recognize the legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people.
   ``Peace can neither be negotiated nor achieved without PLO
participation,'' Hussein said.
   The king's involvement in the peace process has diminished
considerably since last summer, when he severed administrative and
legal ties with Palestinians in the West Bank.
   On Capitol Hill, Walker said Hussein would have to be an
integral part of future peace talks because of his country's
geographic, historic and demographic links with the West Bank.
   The United States continues to believe that ``the most
realistic'' solution for the future of the West Bank, which Jordan
and Israel have each governed at different times over the last 40
years, ``is some sort of association with Jordan.''
   The United States, which opposes Israeli sovereignty over the
land but also rejects establishment of a Palestinian state there,
proposed in 1982 that the West Bank become a Jordanian-Palestinian
confederation.

   Soldiers shot and wounded 23 Palestinians in
the occupied Gaza Strip on Wednesday, and 11 of the victims were
children, most of whom were hit in the head, hospital officials
said.
   Soldiers and police increased security in the occupied
territories and in Israel to prevent riots or attacks during the
seven-day Jewish Passover holiday that started at sundown Wednesday.
   Violence erupted in four locations in the Gaza Strip _ the Khan
Yunis and Nusseirat refugee camps, the village of Beit Hanoun, and
a neighborhood in Gaza City.
   Arab doctors said the wounded included six children aged 14 or
younger who were struck with rubber-coated metal bullets in the
head and face. Five other youths were struck with plastic or rubber
bullets in other parts of the body, they said.
   The doctors said 12 people between the ages of 15 and 30 also
were injured with plastic bullets.
   Those wounded with rubber bullets were treated and released, the
doctors said.
   A Western relief official in Gaza City said about 40 percent of
the wounded in the Palestinian revolt are now 15 and younger.
   ``In the beginning of the uprising, the average age of those
getting shot was much higher,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Since the start of the revolt in December 1987, 439 Palestinians
have been killed, most shot by soldiers during stone-throwing
protests. Eighteen Israelis have died.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police detained 27 Arabs accused of
involvement in stone-throwing riots in which three policemen and
two Arabs were injured, Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   A public opinion survey published Wednesday in the daily Yediot
Ahronot said 65 percent of Israelis support a peace plan by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir that calls for Palestinians to elect
representatives to negotiate autonomy in the occupied territories.
   The Al Hamishmar newspaper, however, said Jewish settlers in the
occupied territories have formed a committee to try to stop the
election plan, which they claim would ``bring about a Palestinian
state.''
   Yediot Ahronot said it conducted its opinion survey from April
12 to April 16, conducting face-to-face interviews with a random
sample of 656 Israelis.
   It said 65 percent of those questioned said they supported
Shamir's election plan, 31 percent were opposed, and 4 percent said
they had no view.
   No margin of error was given.

   Capitol Records won the right to begin
exclusive distribution of a new ``comeback'' album by Donny Osmond
in a court dispute between the record company and another record
producer.
   Former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, head of Curb Records, had contended
he gained exclusive rights to distribute the song ``Soldier of
Love'' and other songs Osmond recently recorded.
   But U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi ruled Tuesday that a
March 6 agreement gave Capitol the right to distribute the new
album.
   Distribution will begin this week, said Capitol attorney Howard
King.
   He argued Osmond's attempt at a music comeback would be
jeopardized if distribution were delayed.
   Osmond, as part of the Osmond Brothers and later with his
sister, Marie, became a teen idol in the 1970s with such songs as
``Puppy Love,'' ``I'm Leaving It All Up to You'' and ``Paper
Roses.''

   Amid emotional scenes, the audience at London's
Covent Garden Royal Opera House welcomed back Spanish tenor Jose
Carreras after his recovery from leukemia.
   The audience rose and cheered Tuesday night as Carreras, 42,
appeared on stage for a two-hour song recital. The crowd demanded
encore after encore, stamped and applauded and showered the stage
with flowers.
   Carreras, who says he is fully recovered and ``100 percent
perfect,'' was clearly affected by the warmth of his reception.
   His leukemia was diagnosed in 1987. At one time doctors gave him
a 10 percent chance of recovery, but after bone marrow transplants
and chemotherapy he was pronounced fit and made his comeback before
150,000 opera lovers in Barcelona last July.
   Carreras, who now devotes part of his income to an international
foundation he has set up to fight leukemia, bowed out with a
bouquet of red roses presented on stage by Royal Opera chief Jeremy
Isaacs.

   Six-year-old Barbara Bush can't yet read,

arrived from the White House.
   ``She was just tickled to death,'' said the child's grandmother,

   The Owensboro youngster wrote first lady Barbara Bush in March

   Barbara can write her name, but she can't read yet, said Terri
Hanley, home-school coordinator at Foust Elementary School, where
Barbara attends kindergarten.
   To compose her letter, Barbara dictated its contents to her

   What did she say to the first lady?
   ``I love her,'' Barbara said. ``She's sweet and pretty.''
   She also told Mrs. Bush she hopes they can meet one day.
   Mrs. Bush's letter read: ``Dear Barbara, How much I appreciated
your nice message of support and friendship. Your words mean so
much to the President and me. We are both very grateful.''
   It was signed: ``Warmly, Barbara Bush.'' A personal message was
handwritten across the bottom: ``How wonderful to have the same
name. I loved your picture.''
   Barbara said she knows that the first lady works. Her
occupation? ``Shopping,'' Barbara said.

   A California winery worker wanted in the
slaying of seven people, including his wife and two of his three
little daughters, was arrested in Mexico, a U.S. Embassy source
said today.
   Ramon Salcido, 28, was arrested in a rural area around Ciudad
Obregon, 900 miles northwest of Mexico City in Sonora state, said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``He is in the custody of the Federal Judiciary Police. Salcido
was arrested in a rural area around Ciudad Obregon, that's my
understanding. We have no other details,'' the source said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Graves said he had no details around
the arrest and didn't know if Salcido is an American citizen. ``We
don't know for the moment what his citizenship is,'' he said.
   Vicente Mendoza, a spokesman for the attorney general's office,
said he could not confirm or deny the report. The Federal Judiciary
Police is a branch of the attorney general's office.
   ``We have no information for the time being,'' he said.
   Ciudad Obregon is 120 miles north of Salcido's hometown of Los
Mochis.
   The arrest came a day after California authorities reported
numerous possible sightings of Salcido.
   Services were being held in Glen Ellen, Calif., today for some
of the six members of Salcido's family who were killed. About 300
people attended a memorial service Tuesday for another of the
victims, Tracy Toovey. Twenty sheriff's deputies attended to keep
an eye out for Salcido.
   Authorities in California also said Salcido, a forklift operator
who worked with Toovey at a winery, may have been spotted in San
Francisco sometime after the slayings began Friday morning.
   Salcido's mother, Valentino Bojorquez Armendariz, said her son
called her on Friday and told her ``Mama, this is last time you
will hear my voice.''
   Ms. Bojorquez said her eldest son was sobbing in the brief phone
call to her home in Los Mochis, the Los Angeles Times reported in
today's editions. Ms. Bojorquez said her memory of the conversation
wasn't clear, but she remembered that Salcido said, ``I have
problems and I'm going to kill myself,'' or ``I have problems and
they're going to kill me.''
   He then hung up, and Ms. Bojorquez said she had not heard from
him since.
   Sometime between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Friday, the fugitive's wife,
mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and Toovey, were butchered, shot
or both. On Saturday, three of Salcido's daughters were found with
their throats cut, two of them dead.
   The surviving girl, 3-year-old Carmina, is recovering in
Petaluma Valley Hospital, where she underwent a tracheotomy and is
breathing through the hole in her throat to give the cut a chance
to heal. She told investigators her father cut her and her sisters,.
   Salcido's friends said the binge began Wednesday night, a day
after Salcido had been served with Fresno County, California, court
papers ordering him to pay $511 a month support for a 4{-year-old
daughter from another marriage, plus nearly $6,000 to the county
for back payments.
   Salcido has been charged with four of the killings and is sought
on a federal warrant for flight to avoid prosecution.
   In San Francisco, affidavits filed against Salcido in U.S.
District Court this week revealed he left a note asking God's mercy
and blaming the law for the bloody rampage, apparently referring to
the court order in the child-support case.
   In Glen Ellen, residents said they were keeping loaded guns at
the ready. Teen-agers hanging out on the corner of Shone's Grocery
peer sharply at every car going by. Deputies in their patrol cars _
their dashboards plastered with enlarged photos of Salcido _ do the
same thing.
   At El Verano, down the road from Boyes Hot Springs, where
Salcido lived, Abbie Thomas was nervous that the suspect was still
on the loose. Her children, she said, were ``freaked out ... all of
us _ we're keeping our kids close. Who knows what he can do next?''
   ``I hope they torture him, string him up,'' said 77-year-old
Lela Schaefer. ``I can't think of anything bad enough.''

   Public broadcasting is a highly cost-effective
way of helping solve national problems, Corporation for Public
Broadcasting officials said Wednesday in defending a request for
increased program funds and money to replace an aging satellite.
   Corporation president Donald Ledwig told a House Appropriations
subcommittee that every dollar of federal funding to the
organization now attracts nearly $6 in donations in corporate and
audience donations.
   Ledwig also cited educational programs on public radio and
television and the 13,000 hours a year in programming for the
classroom that now reach 101 million TV viewers and more than 10
million radio listeners each week.
   ``Now is not the time to retreat,'' he said, when ``the public
looks increasingly to public broadcasting to meet its needs for
quality programming.''
   He said that each federal dollar spent on an AIDS awareness
program, for example, ``might save this committee thousands of
dollars treating that patient.''
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a private, nonprofit
organization created by Congress to support public broadcasting. It
passes on about 71 percent of its operating budget to public radio
and television stations. It gets its federal money two years in
advance and is seeking $265 million for fiscal 1992.
   The Bush administration wants to freeze the corporation's
appropriation at the 1991 level of $242 million and not provide any
new money to replace a 10-year-old satellite that is expected to
die in 1991.
   Congress has authorized $200 million for the satellite, but has
appropriated just $56.8 million of that amount, in 1991.
   Ledwig said failure to replace the satellite would have a severe
impact on programming funds that would have to be diverted to
satellite construction.
   He also said congressional support for the full $265 million
request ``is critical if CPB is to continue to increase the high
standards of public broadcasting and to tap deeper into the
potential that it holds for addressing many of this nation's most
pressing problems.''
   If the budget is frozen _ which means a cut, when inflation is
counted _ the corporation loses the $6 in donations for each dollar
cut, Ledwig said.
   Federal funds ``are the key dollars that bring in the others''
he said.
   Outlining something of a domino effect, Ledwig said that if the
corporation's budget is cut, ``We start losing quality of the
programming, we start losing audience, and we start losing
contributions.''
   The three subcommittee members in attendance each praised public
broadcasting, but said it would be very difficult to increase
spending given the current federal budget pinch.
   Subcommittee chairman William Natcher, D-Ky., asked how Ledwig
could justify a request for a 9.5 percent spending hike.
   Ledwig said the corporation was ``acutely aware'' of the
competing demands on Congress for federal dollars.
   ``I believe, however, that federal support for public
broadcasting is one of the most cost-effective means to address a
number of critical problems facing the nation today.''
   He said the corporation's 4.3 percent for administrative costs
was the lowest of any agency in the government.
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, said he thought public broadcasters may
be trying to mimic commercial television by paying high salaries to
on-air personalities and $15,000 appearance fees to guests.
   Smith was particularly concerned that Louis Rukeyser, host of
the popular ``Wall Street Week'' program, was being paid in six
figures.
   ``Can you justify giving sombody three times as much salary ...
than we pay a Supreme Court justice?'' Smith asked.
   Ledwig said the show does not receive any funds from the
corporation.

   Five days of factional
fighting in Natal Province has killed 14 blacks, including four who
were ambushed by gunmen after getting off a bus, police and
witnesses said Wednesday.
   More than 1,200 people have died during fighting between black
factions since mid-1987, according to local groups. They say 165 of
those victims were killed in the first three months of this year.
   Six people were killed Tuesday night in Shongeni Valley between
the southeastern cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, the
provincial capital, police said without providing details.
Journalists saw three of the bodies.
   Two men and two women were killed Monday night in Taylor's Halt,
a township outside Pietermaritzburg, police also said.
   Witnesses and families said those victims had just alighted from
a bus when gunmen sprang from the bush and fired at them. They said
several other people were wounded.
   Residents said a man and a 13-year-old boy were shot in the same
area Monday night and two other teen-agers were shot to death in
their home outside Pietermaritzburg on Friday.
   The main combatants in the fighting are the banned United
Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition,
and Inkatha, the political group of Zulu leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but their tactics differ. The
front favors protests, boycotts, sanctions and other
confrontational methods that Inkatha does not endorse.
   Some anti-apartheid activists accuse Buthelezi of collaborating
with the white-run government because he participates in the black
homeland system.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II prayed for Poland on Wednesday as
Lech Walesa, his Solidarity union made legal again by the communist
government, arrived to seek economic aid for his country and thank
the pontiff for his help.
   At his public audience, John Paul said in a prayer for success
of his homeland's new political course:
   ``I pray to you, Lady of Jasna Gora ... the country will have
new possibilities and that transformations will take place in the
social, political, economic and moral life of the entire society.''
His reference was to Poland's holiest shrine.
   Solidarity, which Walesa founded in 1980 as the Soviet bloc's
first independent trade union, regained official status Monday.
   Walesa had a symbolic reconciliation Tuesday with the Polish
leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who declared martial law in
December 1981 to crush Solidarity.
   At Leonardo da Vinci Airport, he told reporters: ``There is a
great accord between society and the government. It is a political
victory for all of us in Polish society, but for this victory to be
complete we now have to take care of real issues and to get down to
work together.''
   The Polish government agreed in two months of negotiations with
an opposition delegation led by Solidarity to legalize the union
and create a freely elected Senate as a second house of the Sejm,
or parliament.
   Poland hopes the result will be financial help from the West and
Solidarity's cooperation in confronting the national economic
crisis.
   Walesa met with Bishop Fiorenzo Angelini, chief of the Vatican
medical mission, and thanked him for aid the office gave Solidarity
medical programs. Angelini pledged another $30,000.
   Later, Walesa attended a crowded Mass celebrated by four Polish
bishops at St. Marian in Trastevere church. As the faithful
received communion, two people unfurled a red-and-white Solidarity
banner.
   The Solidarity leader has said he wants to encourage Western aid
for Poland during his three-day visit to Italy, which includes
meetings with politicians and labor leaders.
   In John Paul's first public comment on the legalization of
Solidarity, the pontiff prayed Wednesday that all involved in
Poland's new political course would ``continue to demonstrate the
courage, wisdom and calm indispensable to serving the public good.''
   Addressing the Madonna of Jasna Gora, he said: ``Today I want to
thank you, oh Mother, for all the good that has grown from the
experiences of that period'' when Solidarity was suppressed and
outlawed.
   ``I give to your maternal care Solidarity, which today, after
the new legalization of April 17, can return to activity.''
   Walesa said he would ask John Paul on Thursday ``to give his
blessing to this difficult task of reform'' and said the pope ``has
always been with us.''
   John Paul warmly endorsed Solidarity when he met Walesa in
January 1981 at the Vatican. The pontiff and the shipyard
electrician met again during papal trips to Poland in 1983, the
year Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize, and 1987.
   The church is a major force in Poland, a devoutly Roman Catholic
country despite its communist government, and church
representatives participated in the negotiations.
   In a clear illustration of Solidarity's change in status, the
Polish ambassador to Italy met Walesa at the airport.

   A man has been charged with shooting at the
windows of an Exxon service station in an apparent protest against
the company's handling of the giant crude-oil spill in Alaska.
   Stephen Hugo Rice, 45, a University of Washington student from
Ballard, was charged Tuesday with two counts of malicious mischief.
He faces up to 60 days in jail. Arraignment was set for Thursday.
   No one was hit, but the shootings caused $1,000 damage.
   In an affidavit, King County Deputy Prosecutor Jonathan Love
said Rice admitted firing at the windows of the Seattle station
March 31 and April 14. Rice said he was protesting ``Exxon
negligence in cleaning up the oil spill,'' Love alleged. The spill
occurred March 24 in Prince William Sound.
   ``The defendant stated he would continue to shoot at Exxon
stations until they did something in Alaska about the oil spill,''
Love told the court in requesting bail of $5,000. ``At the rate
Exxon is progressing, it is best that Mr. Rice remain in jail.''

<TEXT>
   The Christian army commander, Gen. Michel
Aoun, said Wednesday the United States was involved in ``a
conspiracy of silence'' by failing to halt Syrian attacks on
Lebanon's Christian heartland.
   Aoun addressed about 1,200 Christians who braved intermittent
rocket and artillery barrages and marched to the presidential
palace in suburban Baabda to support Aoun's ``war of liberation''
against Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   Christian parliamentarians have called for a cease-fire in the
fighting with the Syrians and their Druse Moslem militia allies.
   But the demonstrators rejected the suggestion, highlighting a
split in the Christian camp. The demonstrators burned an effigy of
Syrian President Hafez Assad and chanted ``Death to Assad!''
   Police say 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded since the
latest round of fighting flared March 8. Most victims have been
civilians.
   Several rounds of rocket and mortar fire struck Christian east
Beirut and Moslem west Beirut on Wednesday, but there were no
reports of casualties.
   Only a handful of people ventured outside, and radio stations
said the relative calm was no more than a ``warriors' rest.''
   ``America's secretary of state says the United States is
incapable of doing anything to help Lebanon. This is the plot.
America is not incapable, but America is taking part in a
conspiracy of silence regarding the destruction of Lebanon by
Syria,'' Aoun said.
   He was commenting on Secretary of State James A. Baker III's
remarks Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Baker said: ``We make a lot of statements and sometimes it is
frustrating to think that is really about all we can do.
   ``I don't know what else, frankly, we can do. We have scant
influence with the Syrians,'' Baker said.
   Aoun said sarcastically, ``Maybe Syria has become so powerful
that America is scared of it.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States would support ``any efforts'' by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to help negotiate a
cease-fire.
   France, which has close ties to the Lebanese and ruled the
country until 1943, suggested Perez de Cuellar travel to Syria or
Tunisia to work out a cease-fire. The U.N. chief said he was not
considering any such initiative as long as efforts by the 22-member
Arab League continue.
   The latest hostilities broke out after Aoun ordered a blockade
of militia-run ports that deprive the treasury of $100 million a
year in tax revenue.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the
310-square-mile Christian enclave. The Syrians later joined the
shelling.
   Beirut and its surroundings have been without electricity since
Sunday, when power plants ran out of fuel oil. The stations also
have been severely damaged in the bombardments.
   Water supplies also have stopped. Bread and other vital
commodities have become scarce. The shortages and shelling have
forced thousands of people to flee to south and east Lebanon or
leave the country altogether.
   The French navy ship Rance carried 78 severely wounded Lebanese
to Larnaca, Cyprus, on Wednesday. Fifty-three of the casualties
were flown to Paris aboard a special French hospital plane. The
others needed another day of quiet before they could be moved,
doctors said.

<HEAD>Chairman of House Panel Questions Aid to Israel Because of Shootings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House foreign operations
panel on Wednesday questioned U.S. aid to Israel in light of
incidents in which Israeli soldiers have shot fleeing Palestinian
demonstrators in the back.
   ``When is that stupid practice going to end?'' asked David Obey,
D-Wis., who heads the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations,
which appropriates foreign aid money.
   ``I don't want to take responsibility for giving one dime to a
country whose military forces are firing at people in retreat,''
Obey said angrily at a hearing on the Bush administration's 1990
aid request for Israel and other Middle Eastern countries.
   It is rare for a congressman to make such bluntly critical
comments in public about Israel.
   The administration is asking to maintain the same level of aid
to Israel _ $3 billion, the most of any foreign nation.
   Obey said he had raised his concerns with the Bush
administration and with Israel and all he had received were
``words.''
   A State Department official who handles U.S. ties with the
Middle East, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Ned Walker, said
the administration continues to urge Israel to stop the practice.
``We're not satisfied,'' he said.
   But Walker also expressed sympathy for the Israeli soldiers,
saying he had been in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and seen them
having to deal with violent Palestinian demonstrators. ``It's
difficult for them,'' he said of the soldiers.
   More than 400 Palestinians have been killed in a violent
uprising launched 17 months ago to protest Israel's 21-year rule of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Walker praised some recent Israeli measures such as the release
of more than 450 Palestinian inmates, the unsealing of some houses
blocked by Israeli forces as punitive measures, and the restoration
of loudspeakers to Arab mosques. But he said Israel's ``record is
still mixed,'' as shown by last week's shooting by security forces
of at least five Palestinians in the West Bank village of Nahalin.
   Israeli military regulations allow soldiers to shoot plastic
bullets at demonstrators fleeing the scene of a violent
demonstration. Israeli spokesmen say plastic bullets are less
lethal than other ammunition, but dozens of Palestinians have been
killed _ some shot in the back _ because soldiers fired from closer
than the required distance.

<TEXT>
   More than 60 national organizations announced
plans Wednesday for a huge march on Washington Oct. 7 to demand
more federal housing assistance for the nation's homeless.
   ``This isn't a march so much as it is a calling forth of the
human spirit,'' declared a tearful Valerie Harper, the actress and
longtime homeless activist. ``It's an expression of who we are as
human beings.''
   She addressed a marathon news conference at which dozens of
prominent civil rights, labor, church and anti-poverty leaders
announced the creation of a ``Housing Now!'' umbrella organization
and plans for the march in October.
   At least 63 nationwide organizations are participating. They
include the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the YWCA of the
United States, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the
National Urban League, the National Organization for Women, the
National Senior Citizens Council and the National Rainbow
Coalition, headed by The Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Barry Zigas, a principal organizer of the march and president of
the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, predicted that
``hundreds of thousands'' of people would participate.
   Famed homeless activist Mitch Snyder noted that ``I was 6 years
old when Congress passed legislation calling for safe and
affordable housing for all Americans. Well, I'm 45 now. And it's
time to remind one another that the wealthiest nation on Earth has
the resources, but simply lacks the will, to get the job done.''
   Alexandria, Va., Mayor James P. Moran Jr., speaking for the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, blamed the homeless problem on the
abandonment of the federal housing assistance policies of the 1960s
and 1970s. ``If we had continued those policies,'' he said, ``about
1.8 million more households would be receiving housing assistance _
or enough to accommodate 4 million people. It's no coincidence that
there are 3 million homeless in this country,'' he declared.
   Since 1981, budget authority for all federal housing assistance
programs has been cut by more than 75 percent _ from $32 billion to
less than $8 billion a year, according to the new coalition. It
said only about 1 out of every 4 eligible poor renters actually
receives a federal housing subsidy.
   Moran noted also that the Department of Housing and Urban
Development estimates than more than 24 million people spend more
than half of their income on housing. ``That's a disgrace,'' he
said.
   The joint ``call to action'' issued by the coalition complained
that ``Congress hides behind the budget deficit when it comes to
housing our people. We call on Congress to recognize housing as the
immediate national priority it must become.''
   ``We cannot deny,'' said actor Jon Voight, ``that wherever we
step, we step over a human being lying helplessly in our streets.
Unless we act now, our streets will be littered with them.''
   ``We are sitting on our hands, and more and more people are
suffering,'' said Louisa Stark, president of the National Coalition
for the Homeless. She cited a recent MIT study which indicated that
by the year 2,000, there will be an estimated 19 million homeless
Americans, barring a change in policy.

<HEAD>HHS Official Says Medicare Computer System Could Guard Against Drug
Reactions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new prescription drug benefit program being
readied for 32 million Medicare beneficiaries offers a golden
opportunity to include safeguards against adverse reactions that
hospitalize at least 200,000 elderly people a year, witnesses told
a House panel Wednesday.
   Richard Kusserow, inspector general for the Department of Health
and Human Services, told the committee that it would be ``stupid''
for Congress to be so insistent on enforcing an arbitrary deadline
for setting up a computer-based billing system that it closes off
the possibility of building in the safeguards.
   The idea, he said, is to program the Medicare computer system
that will link the nation's pharmacies so that the pharmacist
filling a doctor's prescription will be able to tell on the spot
whether the patient is taking another drug that could react with
the new one.
   Some private pharmacy chains already use such programs, often
citing them in advertising as a reason to shop at a particular
pharmacy.
   Kusserow was called before the subcommittee of the Select
Committee on Aging to elaborate on a study that has found the
Medicare program paid at least $500 million in 1987 for hospital
admissions that were related to an adverse prescription drug
reaction or an overdose.
   He told the panel that is a conservative figure because
hospitals do not always flag drug reaction cases in the records
they submit for Medicare reimbursements.
   Preliminary results from the report released previously found
that the elderly account for 200,000, or 39 percent, of all
hospitalizations from drug reactions and half of deaths from such
reactions.
   Kusserow, who has referred to the situation as ``America's other
drug problem,'' said he is concerned that the Health Care Financing
Administration is feeling so much congressional pressure to meet
have a prescription drug billing system up and running well before
the 1991 startup of the program that it will design a system that
precludes adding computerized crosschecks of various medications a
Medicare beneficiary may already be taking.
   ``I think that would be stupid and I would hate to see that
happen,'' he said.
   Beginning in 1991, Medicare will pay 50 percent of drug costs
after a $600 annual deductible. The government payment rises to 60
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 _ also after a
$600 deduction.
   Suggesting that Congress was not entirely clear in the
instructions it gave HCFA on how to set up a national system to
keep track of Medicare drug claims, Kusserow said, ``My concern is
that we will rush ahead to create a data base driven solely by
financial record-keeping concerns and neglect the quality of care
issue.''
   Heading off drug reactions before they occur would save money in
the long run by cutting down hospitalization costs for treating the
victims of such episodes, he said.
   Almost all adverse prescription drug reactions stem from
patients not properly following directions for taking the medicine
or taking different medicines that can react with each other _
either drugs they are prescribed by different physicians or by a
single physician who doesn't know any better.
   Food and Drug Administrator Frank Young supported Kusserow in
calling for a HCFA computer system that provides a way to
crosscheck prescriptions.
   ``We think this is a golden opportunity,'' said Young. ``We fear
it may be implemented without including a way to do this.''

<HEAD>City Board Has Authority To Close Down Houses, Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials appointed a citizens
board with the authority to close buildings or businesses where
drug activity has become entrenched.
   City General Counsel James L. Harrison described the power of
the Drug Nuisance Board as ``pretty drastic,'' but also called it
``one of the most significant'' steps taken by the city to fight
drug dealing.
   The five-member board can order landowners to make changes in
their buildings, or the activities that go on there, to prevent
drugs from being sold.
   It also has the power to close businesses entirely in cases
where members think the owners are unable or unwilling to do
anything to stop drug dealing.
   The board, which met for the first time Tuesday, will hear
evidence presented by the General Counsel's Office about buildings
where drug deals are known to have taken place at least three times.
   The City Council authorized the board last July, but it was not
formed until recently because of questions of its constitutionality.
   Steve Rohan, an attorney with the General Counsel's Office, said
police and private citizens can recommend that buildings be
targeted for the board's review.
   Sheriff's Lt. David Sembach said police have been mailing
notices to property owners for several weeks advising them drug
deals are taking place on their land.

   U.S. officials Wednesday stepped up
efforts to convince European allies that NATO must improve its
short-range nuclear weapons by offering intelligence information on
how the Soviets are boosting their arsenal.
   Defense sources said, however, that it remained unclear how the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization would handle the
politically sensitive issue.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, attending his first NATO meeting,
presented what was described as an unexpectedly extensive
intelligence briefing behind closed doors, stressing the Soviet
Union's efforts in the past five years to modernize its own arsenal
of short-range nuclear missiles and artillery shells.
   ``Our evidence is overwhelming that this has been an on-going
process and will continue to be an on-going process,'' said one
senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The decision to offer the briefing was prompted by a growing
split within the Western alliance, in which West Germany, Belgium
and some other European countries have expressed doubt about moving
now to replace the Lance nuclear missiles deployed with NATO
forces. Those missiles are expected to become obsolete by the
mid-1990s and American officials say NATO has no choice but to
replace them and maintain some nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Belgium, West Germany and a few other NATO members also have
questioned the wisdom of proceeding now with modernization when it
might be possible to open new arms control talks with the Soviets
on the issue.
   The United States counters that negotiations should be completed
on reducing long-range nuclear missiles and conventional forces
before NATO worries about short-range battlefield missiles.
   At the conclusion of the first day of NATO consultations, the
American defense source said the United States was convinced the
modernization issue had been spawned by internal politics within
individual countries, and not by any real split between the United
States and its allies.
   While final decisions on production and deployment schedules are
not necessary right now, the source continued, the U.S. government
does need some broad language of support for nuclear modernization
in order to win funding from Congress to start missile development
work.
   ``No specific decisions on specific weapons in specific numbers
in specific locations are required now,'' said the U.S. source.
   ``But it is clear that Congress will not support programs that
they believe that the alliance is not prepared to see become a part
of our deterrent. And that's a problem. So there is no doubt that
Congress will be looking to see if there is a proper expression of
support.''
   The NATO allies agreed Wednesday that nuclear weapons cannot be
withdrawn from Europe given the current arms balance with Russia
and the Warsaw Pact, and thus Cheney hopes to win the expression of
support he wants, the source concluded.
   ``NATO is 40 years old this year. It has gone through many
crises and we will also overcome this one,'' said Dutch Defense
Minister Frits Bolkestein.
   The first day of discussions ran longer than expected. Officials
described the talks as businesslike, with no voices raised in the
closed-door meetings.
   Officials said the allies appeared in agreement that the defense
ministers should not do anything that would be seen as upsetting in
the next few weeks before a summit of President Bush and other NATO
leaders. That gathering will be held at the end of May in Brussels.
   The officials were continuing to discuss the wording of a public
statement that will be released at the end of talks on Thursday.
   Belgium's defense minister, Guy Coeme, said, ``There is still
ennormous work to be done.''
   At issue is how clear the statement expresses support for the
modernization program.
   ``You don't design a missile to European standards, based on the
recommendations of the Europeans, with the understanding that
they're not going to deploy it,'' the U.S. source said.
   However, officials of other European delegations have said it
was unlikely that the language would go beyond that of previous
statements when the allies have said their forces ``will be kept
up-to-date where necessary.''
   Belgium has said it wanted to hold off decisions on modernizing
short-range nuclear weapons until the early 1990s and agree to open
East-West arms talks on the arms as soon as possible. The
government also expressed concern about extending the range of the
new generation Lance.
   Coeme said, ``The process is still ongoing but I can say on the
range issue and on the wish to open negotiations, Belgium is
certainly not alone.''
   German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz reiterated his country's
view that no decisions on production or deployment of new weapons
were required immediately.
   ``The if, how and when (of production and deployment) are not
necessary to decide now, here,'' Scholz said.
   The NATO members are Canada, the United States, Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Turkey.
France, which is not part of NATO's integrated military structure,
does not attend the nuclear discussions. Iceland takes part as an
observer.

<HEAD>Jury Weighs Life Or Death For Shopping Center Killer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor asked jurors Wednesday to
reject defense claims of temporary insanity and recommend the death
penalty for a man convicted of killing six people in a shopping
center shooting spree.
   William Cruse left ``a killing field'' behind him in the two
Palm Bay shopping centers where he also tried to kill 24 others in
1987, State Attorney Norm Wolfinger told jurors.
   ``May God have mercy on the defendant's soul for his cruel and
atrocious and uncaring acts,'' Wolfinger said in his final
argument. ``Evidence has shown that this defendant has forfeited
his right to live on Earth.
   ``He is a cold, calculating killer. He deserves to die.''
   Cruse demonstrated that he was in total control of his mental
faculties when he methodically tracked down and shot at his victims
repeatedly, some of them while they lay wounded and moaning,
Wolfinger said.
   There was premeditation because ``his plan was to kill, kill,
kill. He meant to do it and he did it,'' he said.
   Public defenders representing the 61-year-old former librarian
were to present their final arguments later.
   The jurors who convicted Cruse on April 5 of 32 counts of
murder, attempted murder and kidnapping now have to recommend his
punishment: death or life in prison without possibility of parole
for 25 years. The verdict can be by simple majority rather than
unanimously.
   Circuit Judge John Antoon said he would give ``great weight'' to
the panel's recommendation, but he does not have to accept it in
passing either sentence.
   The state attorney held up a shotgun used in the wounding of a
teen-ager across the street from Cruse's house. Wolfinger pumped
the weapon several times in front of the jury. He then held up the
semiautomatic assault rifle used in the shopping center rampage,
popping in a 30-round clip several times.
   Anticipating defense arguments that Cruse was insane at the time
of the April 23, 1987, shootout, the prosecutor said: ``There has
never been any disagreement over mental illness. The only
disagreement is its effect'' and how much of a role it played in
the crimes.
   The defense tried to present ``every conceivable, so-called
bizarre incident'' in Cruse's life, Wolfinger said, and it wanted
the jury to feel that ``he should be relieved of all responsibility
for that crime.''
   As to arguments about the defendant's delusions over
homosexuality, Wolfinger said: ``What we have here is a man who
can't accept the doubts of his own masculinity ... and blamed it on
everyone else.''

   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said
Wednesday he thinks central charges dropped from the Iran-Contra
case of Oliver North are ``salvageable'' against former National
Security Adviser John Poindexter.
   In a court session before U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson,
Walsh said U.S. intelligence agencies are showing greater
flexibility than they did previously in regard to what classified
material may be declassified for trial.
   Walsh also said some classified documents which caused the
intelligence community concern in the North case aren't relevant in
the Poindexter case. He said he was willing to make the documents
available so that the defense can see for itself the ``lack of
relevance.''
   ``I think they are salvageable,'' Walsh said of conspiracy,
theft and wire fraud counts. ``There has been a softening in the
position of the intelligence agencies.''
   Due to national security concerns, conspiracy and theft counts
against North were dismissed Jan. 13. Earlier, a charge of wire
fraud against him also was dismissed.
   North, who worked under Poindexter at the White House, has faced
trial on 12 remaining felony charges over the past 12 weeks. His
case is expected to go to the jury Thursday.
   North, Poindexter and businessmen Richard Secord and Albert
Hakim were indicted March 16, 1988,in the Iran-Contra affair. All
were charged with conspiracy, theft of government property and wire
fraud, as well as other crimes.
   The conspiracy and theft counts accused them of illegally
diverting more than $14 million in Iran arms-sale proceeds to the
Nicaraguan rebels. The wire fraud count accused them of carrying
out the diversion through telephone calls and other communications.
   In court, Robinson said Poindexter's attorney Richard Beckler
should submit a discovery request by May 15 for material he wants
to use.
   Christian Mixter, an attorney in Walsh's office, asked that the
date be moved up, a request which made Poindexter, sitting at the
defense table, shake his head in displeasure. Robinson agreed to
give the defense until May 15.
   The conspiracy and theft counts in the North case foundered
after U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled Dec. 12 that
significant amounts of classified information could not be deleted
from 300 documents Walsh wanted to use against North at trial.
   Among the items the judge said would have to be disclosed in
order to ensure a fair trial were verbatim texts of intelligence
reports and names of Central American countries.
   The judge also insisted on including references to foreign
officials by their general importance and function, and also
references to CIA officials and sources.
   Faced with the refusal of intelligence agencies to declassify so
much information for use at North's trial, Walsh went into court
and asked Gesell to dismiss the charges.

   Oliver North's lawyer pleaded for acquittal
today, telling jurors the former White House aide ``doesn't want to
be a hero. He just wants to go home.''
   In an emotional closing argument, Brendan Sullivan said North
became a ``sacrificial lamb'' in the Reagan White House and was
fired to spare the former president political harm.
   ``Now he cries out,'' Sullivan said as the 12-week Iran-Contra
trial wound toward its conclusion a few blocks from the White House
where North once worked. ``In a sense he has been a hostage. I ask
you on the evidence to set him free.''
   In his hour-long rebuttal, prosecutor John Keker put down
Sullivan's closing argument with the Shakespearian line: ``It was
all sound and fury, signifying nothing.''
   ``You have heard a lot about courage at this trial,'' said
Keker. ``There's another kind of courage: courage to admit when you
are wrong; courage to admit personal responsibility, courage to
admit guilt where appropriate. He (North) has not admitted any of
those things; it's time for you to do it for him.''
   North, a former Marine, is charged with 12 criminal counts of
lying to Congress and the attorney general, illegally converting
travelers checks to his own use and conspiracy to defraud the
Treasury through a tax scam to support the Contra rebels fighting
the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   If convicted, he could receive prison terms totaling 60 years
and fines of $3 million.
   Prosecutor John Keker was permitted time to address the jury a
final time after Sullivan concluded. Judge Gerhard Gesell is
expected to give the case to the jury on Thursday.
   Sullivan, who has North's defense lawyer through tumultuous
congressional hearings and tedious courtoom maneuvering, seemed to
grow emotional as he summed up the defense for the last time.
   ``Greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down his
life for another,'' the lawyer read from a Bible in his hand.
   ``That's the kind of man Ollie North is,'' said Sullivan. ``Now
he cries out. In a sense he has been a hostage. I ask you on the
evidence to set him free.''
   ``Ollie North doesn't want to be a hero,'' the attorney
declared. ``He just wants to go home.''
   Sullivan described the Reagan administration and the Iran-Contra
affair this way:
   ``It's like a big octopus. The president, McFarlane, Poindexter,
Casey ... they are all reaching out to get Ollie North to run
something. ... They are all reaching out to get him.''
   Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter were national security
advisers to President Reagan, and the late William Casey was CIA
director.
   Earlier, Sullivan said it was ``natural instinct'' for North to
destroy documents because he was engaged in some of the
government's most secret operations.
   ``It's a reasonable thing to do,'' Sullivan said of North's
decision to destroy records as he prepared to leave the National
Security Council staff in November 1986. ``The act of destroying
documents'' would be the ``natural instinct of anybody running a
covert operation.''
   ``Colonel North had charge of running some of the most secret
operations'' in the government, Sullivan said as North's
Iran-Contra trial approached its end.
   The former NSC aide is accused of altering, destroying,
concealing and removing documents as the Iran-Contra affair emerged
publicly in November 1986.
   North testified that among the documents he destroyed were memos
reflecting the diversion of funds from the sale of weapons to Iran
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. One memo reflecting a planned
diversion that North neglected to shred was found in his files on
Nov. 22, 1986 by an aide to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Elsewhere in his closing arguments, Sullivan said highly
sensitive information distributed to CIA Director Casey and
national security adviser Poindexter in November 1985 showed that
Hawk missiles were aboard a flight to Iran.
   Sullivan referred to the foreign intelligence data to bolster
his defense against charges that North prepared a false chronology
of events that prompted Casey and Poindexter to mislead Congress in
November 1986.
   North is accused of preparing documents stating that no one in
the U.S. government knew until January 1986 that Hawks were aboard
an aircraft to Iran on the November 1985 flight assisted by the
CIA. A CIA proprietary airline carried the shipment.
   Sullivan held up a notebook stuffed with 417 pages of 168
top-secret intercepted messages that pertained to the Hawk shipment.
   The intelligence data was distributed immediately to Casey and
Poindexter hours after it was gathered, he said.
   Any accusation ``based on the charge that Ollie North was the
repository of special information is wrong, false, inaccurate,
misleading and unfair,'' Sullivan argued.
   Referring to Casey as ``the master spy,'' he said: ``Is anybody
to believe he didn't know what was in the intercept book?''
   Sullivan said the material is so sensitive that the jurors won't
be permitted to see it. He held up a brief summary of the
information culled from the intercepts.
   When Casey testified to Congress on Nov. 21, 1986, he gave no
indication that the CIA and National Security Council staff knew
the November 1985 shipment contained arms. Poindexter testified
that the U.S. government didn't learn until January 1986 that
Israel had transferred 18 Hawk missiles to Iran.
   The November 1985 Hawk shipment was of questionable legality. It
was been retroactively legalized by a ``finding'' that President
Reagan signed in December 1985.

<HEAD>Sign Saying `Woody Guthrie Was No Hero' Torn Down in Singer's Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKEMAH, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tearing down of a sign declaring
``Woody Guthrie Was No Hero'' in the folk singer's hometown has
refueled longstanding debate over how locals should remember
Okemah's most famous native son.
   David Cox, a reporter for the weekly Okemah News Leader, faces a
$54 fine for tearing down the sign last week on the American Legion
building across the street from the newspaper office.
   The sign was put up by funeral director Bart Webb, a former city
councilman and a member of the Legion. Webb filed the municipal
complaint against Cox alleging destruction of private property.
Cox, 26, said he plans to represent himself at a May 8 hearing.
   The incident is the latest in a dispute that has raged for years
in the town of 3,500, with Guthrie's detractors saying he was a
Communist and his admirers saying the man who penned ``This Land is
Your Land'' ought to be honored.
   Tensions are expected to heighten with the scheduled appearance
of Guthrie's son, Arlo, in an April 29 concert at Okemah's Crystal
Theater. Arlo Guthrie has never performed in his father's hometown.
   Webb's 2-foot-by-3-foot sign reprints a recent editorial from
The Oklahoma Constitution, a conservative Oklahoma City tabloid.
The newspaper, under the headline ``Woody Was No Hero,'' calls
Guthrie a ``militant atheist.''
   The sign was replaced after it was torn down, but it was gone
again Wednesday. Cox said he doesn't know who removed it this time.
   Patricia Cheatham, wife of American Legion commander Max
Cheatham, said the Legion post will meet Thursday to discuss
whether the sign should be displayed at the Legion hall. The sign
also was posted elsewhere around town, she said, but Cox said he
hadn't seen it anywhere else.
   Webb would not consent to a telephone interview, a spokeswoman
at his funeral home said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Cheatham described Webb as ``very patriotic.'' He was
defeated in his bid for a second city council term earlier this
month.
   Mrs. Cheatham said until recent years most townspeople ignored
Guthrie, who died in 1967. A movie about his life, ``Bound For
Glory,'' rekindled some interest, she said.
   Guthrie's house was demolished years ago and remains a pile of
debris on an overgrown lot a few blocks from downtown. But a town
water tower visible from Interstate 40 proclaims Okemah as the home
of Woody Guthrie.
   Arlo Guthrie's appearance coincides with the release of an album
taped in December by local musicians and school children as a
tribute to the Dust Bowl balladeer.

   A high school bodybuilder with a history of
violent crimes was sought Wednesday for stabbing his former
girlfriend, the girl's mother and a 2-year-old child.
   The girl's mother and the child were in critical condition
Wednesday. The mother was in a coma; police said they were unable
to estimate how many times she had been cut.
   Police said the suspect, Carlos Frederick Yeazel, walked away
last week from a group home where state authorities recently placed
him.
   Yeazel, 18, was being sought for the stabbing Tuesday of Kathy
Mitchell, 50; Connie Mitchell, her 17-year-old daughter; and
2-year-old Rachelle Pottorf, who was staying at a day-care center
Kathy Mitchell ran in her home.
   The attack occurred after Yeazel and Connie Mitchell broke off a
months-long relationship, said police in this bedroom community
northwest of Denver. Connie Mitchell had cuts on her arms and legs,
officials said.
   ``He (Yeazel) has an extensive history of violent crimes,'' said
Lt. Ted Mink, adding that he could not disclose the charges because
they were brought against a juvenile.
   Yeazel, who was born in Colombia and was adopted by an American
family in 1985, told his friends that while in Colombia he used
cocaine ``because it was easier to get than food,'' said Teresa
Salins, mother of an Arvada High School student.
   Mink said there was no evidence that Yeazel used cocaine in the
United States.
   He also said there was no evidence Yeazel used steroids,
although several high school students told authorities he was an
enthusiastic bodybuilder and they believed he used them. Friends
said Yeazel gave up using cocaine because of his passion for
bodybuilding, but said they believe he began using steroids, a drug
used by some athletes to build muscle bulk.

   Lucille Ball's fans from around the world
flooded a hospital with cards, flowers and phone calls Wednesday
after the queen of comedy emerged from emergency heart surgery in
serious condition.
   ``Her Irish eyes are smiling,'' husband Gary Morton said after
Miss Ball awakened at 9:45 a.m. Wednesday, just 14 hours after
surgeons finished the operation. She was alert and looked well, he
said.
   Surgeons said she should recover from the seven-hour operation,
during which they replaced her aorta and aortic valve with the
donated organ tissue of a 27-year-old man.
   Miss Ball, 77, who reigned for decades as the zany,
rubber-mouthed queen of comedy, had her heart stopped for two hours
during Tuesday's procedure, which was described as surgery with a
``substantial mortality rate.''
   ``Lucille Ball spent an uneventful night, which is a very good
sign. The two surgeons who worked on her continue to be optimistic
that she is moving toward a recovery,'' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
spokesman Ron Wise said.
   ``All indications continue to be positive,'' he said.
   Morton said he told his wife about the hundreds of good wishes
from fans and friends, but she was unable to speak because of an
oxygen mask over her mouth.
   ``The smile in her eyes were sentences,'' the beaming Morton
said.
   The hospital has received hundreds of telephone inquiries, ``as
many calls as the switchboard can handle,'' from fans and the news
media worldwide, particularly Australia and Europe, Wise said.
Flowers were also coming in.
   ``The best thing you could do to get in touch with her is to
send cards to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,'' Wise said, noting Miss
Ball would spend several days in intensive care, where flowers are
banned.
   Robert Kass, the surgeon who performed the operation, said Miss
Ball suffered a tear in her aorta, the main artery in the body.
   ``The fact that she came through this leaves me optimistic,''
Kass said. ``The major risk is in the operating room, at least
initially.''
   Miss Ball, who had been in ill health in recent years, suffered
a mild heart attack about a year ago.
   The redhaired entertainer and her late former husband, Desi
Arnaz, starred in ``I Love Lucy,'' one of the most popular TV shows
of all time, from 1951 to 1957. The show is still seen around the
world in syndicated reruns.
   Miss Ball was last seen in public introducing the Young
Hollywood production number with Bob Hope at the 61st Academy
Awards on March 29. The two comics received a standing ovation.
Wearing a fashionably slit skirt, Miss Ball appeared to be in good
health and giggled freely throughout a brief routine with Hope.
   ``There's only one Lucy. You don't meet many people like her,''
Hope said. ``Like the rest of the world, Dolores (Hope's wife) and
I are praying everything will be all right.''
   Miss Ball went solo in 1962 with ``The Lucy Show.'' The name was
changed to ``Here's Lucy'' in 1968. The show went off the air in
1974.
   The Arnazes had two children, Lucie and Desi Jr.
   Miss Ball married nightclub comedian Morton in 1961. He became
her executive producer.

<UNK>Drug Dealer Nabbed When He Insists On Selling To Police Detectives</UNK>
<DATELINE>MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detective Robert Pyle had to turn down his
police radio so he could hear the man outside his unmarked car
offering to sell him cocaine.
   Pyle, a Delaware County police officer, and Muncie police Lt.
Anthony Mench, who was riding with him, chuckled and followed the
man to a house, where he went inside and came out with drugs.
   Then they arrested Larry Dewayne Wilkerson, 30, on a charge of
cocaine dealing.
   The two officers were patrolling a neighborhood about 11:30 p.m.
Tuesday when they dispersed some teen-agers loitering at a liquor
store parking lot. Soon afterward, Wilkerson began following them
in a car, blinking its headlights, Pyle said.
   Pyle pulled over; the other car pulled over, but nobody got out
of either car. Pyle headed on, and Wilkerson started blinking his
lights again.
   The detective said he turned around and pulled up alongside
Wilkerson, who asked who they were looking for.
   Pyle mentioned the name of a suspected drug dealer; Wilkerson
said he knew where Pyle could get cocaine.
   Pyle and Mench said they followed Wilkerson, chuckling most of
the way. They thought Wilkerson would eventually figure out they
were in a police car, but Wilkerson ``pulled over and hopped out of
his car and got into ours.''
   The two officers concealed their police radios and shotguns and
gave Wilkerson $20.
   Pyle said Wilkerson had them drive to a house; Wilkerson went
inside and emerged with the cocaine. Pyle grabbed the cocaine;
Mench pulled his gun on Wilkerson.
   Wilkerson couldn't believe he was being nabbed, Pyle said. He
kept insisting he was just ``a nice guy who was trying to help you
guys out.''

<HEAD>Government To Prosecute Labor Leaders Who Called General Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government on Wednesday said
it is prosecuting the labor leaders who called a general strike
that prompted bombings, demonstrations, and hundreds of arrests.
   Organizers called Tuesday's strike, which the government
labelled ``a total failure,'' to demand the return of two other
labor leaders banished to provincial towns for helping to organize
a similar protest in 1987.
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said Wednesday the government
is asking a Santiago court to try the labor leaders because ``we
cannot allow this kind of actions.''
   Named in the government's legal action were the acting president
of the United Central Workers, Diego Olivares; and four other
leaders, Nicanor Araya, Sergio Aguirre, Manuel Jimeenez and Moises
Labrana.
   The labor federation called the general strike. It failed to
attract major support from workers but prompted daylong
demonstrations in downtown Santiago and widespread violence in its
slums.
   Police on Wednesday corrected an official report, saying one
suspected guerrilla _ not two _ were killed Tuesday night in a
clash with security agents. Police said the second man is at a
local hospital in critical condition.
   The secret police said the clash occurred when agents caught the
men as they planted a bomb to blow up an electric power pylon in a
working-class district on the outskirts of Santiago.
   Police spokesman Gabriel Ormenno said 412 people were arrested
around the country in the demonstrations. Most of them were to be
released, but 157 remained jailed Wednesday. Officials said 12 were
charged with breaking anti-terrorist law and will be tried.
   Some Santiago neighborhoods remained without power Wednesday
because of the bombing of at least 13 electric towers the day
before. Police said more than 50 bombs went off in Santiago alone,
leaving two men injured and damaging banks, government buildings, a
telephone company office and other facilities.
   Olivares said his labor movement was not responsible for the
violence, which he said had ``dubious origin.'' Leftist groups
opposed to the military government of President Gen. Augusto
Pinochet have bombed power facilities in the past.
   The labor leader said he and his colleagues ``will face with
responsibility any actions by the government against our
organization.''
   The sentence they face will depend on the charges a prosecutor
files within the next few days. They could face banishment like
their two colleagues.

<HEAD>Federal Prison Tightens Security After Copter Escape Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A web of overhead cables covered some open areas of
a federal prison Wednesday as the warden sought to tighten security
in the wake of a failed escape attempt by helicopter.
   Warden John Clark ordered the cables strung over the
high-security exercise courtyard at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center where drug smuggler Benjamin ``Barry'' Kramer hopped on a
hovering helicopter Monday. The aircraft snagged a 14-foot security
fence around the courtyard and crashed.
   Kramer was in satisfactory condition Wednesday at Jackson
Memorial Hospital and the pilot, Charles Clayton Stevens, was in
good condition. Both suffered broken legs. They have been charged
with escape-related counts.
   In the next few months, the entire 48-acre complex which holds
about 1,000 prisoners southwest of Miami will have cables strung
between the roofs of buildings and utility poles.
   ``If a helicopter tries to land, it will be tangled in the
cable,'' Clark said.
   Money to secure the prison against aerial escapes had been
requested from the Department of Justice before Kramer's attempted
breakout, Clark said.
   ``It's an expensive proposition, but after this, I think we'll
get the money for it,'' Clark said.
   Clark said the crash that foiled the escape was caused by the
novice pilot's miscalculation in trying to fly out of the 50-foot
by 200-foot exercise yard.
   Two inmates jumped over the fence to help pull Stevens from the
rubble, Clark said.
   ``At first, we thought they may have been involved in the escape
attempt and (they) were placed in lock-up,'' he said.
   Stevens and Kramer would not have gotten far if the 37-year-old
helicopter had not crashed because U.S. Customs and police planes
would have been sent after them immediately, Clark said.
   The U.S. Marshal's Office was trying to determine how Kramer, of
Hallandale, a champion offshore powerboat racer convicted of drug
smuggling, got in touch with Stevens, a diver in Gold Beach, Ore.
Stevens was just learning to fly a helicopter and had less than 40
hours flying experience on an airplane.

   Oliver North's lawyer, in an emotional final
argument Wednesday, portrayed the former White House aide as a
sacrificial lamb, a scapegoat and a hostage, and implored jurors in
his trial to ``set him free.''
   ``Oliver North never wanted to be a hero,'' said Brendan
Sullivan. ``He just wants to go home.''
   But prosecutor John Keker, having the last word, asked the jury
to ``return a verdict of guilty in each and every one of the 12
charges.''
   With that, the nine women and three men who will decide North's
fate were sent home. They will return Thursday to begin their
deliberations after instructions from U.S. District Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell. During deliberation, the jury will be sequestered for
the first time since the Iran-Contra trial began.
   In his hour-long rebuttal, Keker said it had been an ``unhappy,
unpleasant, miserable criminal trial,'' and dismissed Sullivan's
closing argument with a Shakesperian touch: ``It was all sound and
fury, signifying nothing.''
   ``You have heard a lot about courage at this trial,'' Keker
said. ``There's another kind of courage: courage, to admit when you
are wrong, corage to admit personal responsibility, courage to
admit guilt where appropriate. He (North) has not admitted any of
those things; it's time for you to do it for him.''
   It was the end of two tough days for North, a former Marine
lieutenant colonel whose power while he was at the National
Security Council was substantial. His face paled and he busied
himself with writing while Keker denounced him; he looked at the
jury while Sullivan pleaded for him.
   ``The government has not shown criminal behavior,'' Sullivan
said. ``The man who held the lives of others in his hands, now puts
his life into yours.'' The reference was to North's protecting
names of people he dealt with by shredding or altering documents,
which Sullivan saw as ``a reasonable thing to do.''
   Keker had another explanation: ``He was destroying documents
deliberately so they wouldn't find what he didn't want them to
find.''
   After the arguments, North's mood brightened and he joined his
wife, who was speaking with a minister in the front row of
spectators.
   Sullivan, choked with emotion throughout much of his three-hour
closing argument, mentioned President Reagan's telephone call on
the day North was fired, a call in which the president called North
``a national hero,'' and also a postcard North got from then-Vice
President Bush thanking him for his work.
   ``All these people who went to Ollie North for help, where are
they now?'' Sullivan asked.
   Summing up North's defense in the trial's 12th week, Sullivan
said he had done his job well as a White House aide, following
superiors' orders to help the Nicaraguan rebels, then was thrown
overboard as Reagan sought to escape political heat over the affair.
   Sullivan told the jury that North, who had worked to free
American hostages in Lebanon, has been, in a sense, a hostage
himself.
   ``I ask you, on the evidence, to set him free,'' said Sullivan.
   In the spectator section, behind North at the defense table,
were his wife and three of his four children. Betsy North had been
at the trial before, but it was a first for the children. During a
recess, North took their youngest daughter by the hand and walked
with her down the courtroom corridor.
   North is charged with 12 criminal counts, including lying to
Congress and the attorney general, illegally converting traveler's
checks to his own use and conspiring to defraud the Treasury
through a tax scam to support the rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government. If convicted, he could receive prison terms totaling 60
years and fines of $3 million.
   Sullivan sought to persuade the jurors that the government had
presented only weak evidence to back up the charges against North,
whom he described as caught ``between a rock and a hard place'' in
trying to keep state secrets while he was asked by Congress to tell
all.
   ``He was fired from the White House, offered as a sacrificial
lamb so to speak to the raging Congress,'' Sullivan said, referring
to the day North was fired in November 1986.
   Leaning forward and almost whispering to the jury, Sullivan
asked, ``What do you think was happening? I draw the conclusion the
president was using Ollie North as a scapegoat and threw him
overboard to escape some political heat.''
   Sullivan said North was innocent of the charges that he lied
about raising funds for the Contras, saying there was no evidence
that North ever raised the subject with a contributor or that money
was given in his presence.
   He said Reagan had met with contributors, including one who soon
after donated $1 million worth of stock.
   ``What is the difference between what the president did and
Oliver North did?'' Sullivan asked. ``The president is happily
retired in California and Ollie North has been in Washington 2{
years fighting for his reputation.''
   Sullivan noted that Keker had used a biblical quotation in his
final argument Tuesday, and said he had one of his own.
   ``Greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down his
life for another,'' Sullivan said.
   ``That's the kind of man Ollie North is,'' he said. ``Now he
cries out. In a sense he's been a hostage. I ask you, on the
evidence, to set him free.''
   The Iran-Contra affair was ``like a big octopus,'' said
Sullivan. ``The president, McFarlane, Poindexter, Casey ... they
are all reaching out to get Ollie North to run something. ... They
are all reaching out to get him.''
   He referred to former National Security Advisers Robert
McFarlane and John Poindexter and the late CIA Director William
Casey.

<HEAD>Soviet Says Moscow Will Open Airways to Foreign TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union promised a 35-nation East-West
conference on press freedom Wednesday that it would review working
conditions for Moscow-based journalists and open its airways to
foreign TV programs.
   The chief U.S. delegate accused four of the communist
participants _ Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany and Czechoslovakia _
of ignoring the agreement on press and other freedoms that the 35
countries signed in January at the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   The signatory countries varied from the United States, where
press freedom is enshrined in the constitution, to Romania, where
typewriters have to be licensed and police keep records of the
typefaces.
   The aim of this week's meeting, Information Forum, is to monitor
compliance with the agreement.
   Ambassador Leonard H. Marks, a former director of the U.S.
Information Agency and head of the American delegation, said the
Soviet Union had made substantial progress, including stopping
jamming foreign broadcasts, but its media remained only
``semi-free.''
   ``The concept that the East Europeans and the Soviets had that
the government controls the press is now disappearing ... some
(non-official) viewpoints are presented, not all,'' Marks said in
an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``But we're going to be behind them. The objectives are to have
a free press, not a semi-free press.''
   Soviet deputy foreign minister Vladimir Petrovsky, questioned by
reporters at a news conference on why foreign correspondents were
banned from the Soviet republic of Georgia during nationalist
unrest this month, said, ``We will take this (criticism) very
seriously.''
   ``We will work very hard to provide international standards for
the working of journalists,'' said Petrovsky.
   He said foreign reporters were banned from Georgia, where 20
people were killed in disturbances, ``because it could be dangerous
for the correpondents.''
   In an address to the conference Wednesday, Petrovsky said
foreign correspondents can now travel more freely in the Soviet
Union and were allowed more contact with Soviet citizens.
   ``Glasnost means that every citizen should have the right to
receive complete and reliable information on any public issue,''
said Petrovsky. ``There are no limits to improving reporters'
working conditions.''
   He added that ``extensive work is under way in the Soviet Union
to create optimal conditions to ensure free access to information
... including arranging subscriptions to foreign periodicals and
reception of foreign TV broadcasts.''
   He acknowledged difficulties remained about receiving foreign TV
signals in the Soviet Union, using copying equipment, access to
audio and video information and buying foreign periodicals.
   ``The existing obstacles and restrictions in this area will be
removed as the overall democratization process in the U.S.S.R.
further unfolds.''
   Marks said the four East bloc states he singled out have
recognized the obligations of January's Vienna agreement, ``but
they have not fulfilled them.''
   He said the U.S. delegation will press specific cases during
closed sessions, which start next week after four days of opening
speeches by delegation chiefs.
   ``Our objective is not to be confrontational,'' said Marks. ``We
want to try to solve problems ... we don't need any more
(agreements on) principles, we need action.''
   The Vienna agreement was the outcome of East-West talks on human
rights and free speech that began in Helsinki in the 1970s.

<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese boat suspected of illegal
salmon fishing off the Aleutian Islands steamed toward home
Wednesday, trailed by a Coast Guard cutter seeking permission from
Taiwan to board the vessel.
   ``It's going its way, and we're following,'' said Greg Robinson,
a Coast Guard spokesman in Juneau.
   Because the boat, the Cyi Yang No. 1, is in international
waters, the Coast Guard can't board it without permission, Robinson
said.
   The incident began Sunday when the crew of the Cyi Yang warned
the Jarvis, a Coast Guard cutter on patrol five miles away, that
driftnets were in the water and that it should stay away, said Bill
Woolf, an aide to Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
   Upon learning that it had communicated with a Coast Guard
vessel, the squid boat abandoned its nets and headed southwest,
toward Taiwan, Woolf said. The Jarvis pursued the boat, which did
not respond to demands that it stop.
   Robinson said the encounter took place about 450 miles from
legal fishing waters, about 400 miles southwest of the far end of
the Aleutian chain. By midday Wednesday, the vessels were 1,100
miles southwest of Adak, he said.
   Woolf said Wednesday that a Taiwanese government official had
called the senator to apologize for the incident and to say that
Taiwan will allow the vessel to be boarded.
   The official told Murkowski the Taiwanese government is
attempting to contact the ship's owner to order it to stop, Woolf
said. Robinson said that information had not been relayed to the
Coast Guard by midmorning.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Norm Bangerter signed legislation on
Wednesday appropriating $5 million for cold fusion research and
creating a nine-member committee to oversee the work and its
potential practical application.
   Bangerter charged the panel, comprised of members representing
industry, law, education and the state, to ``make a hard-nosed
evaluation of this process, to make sure the money, when it's
spent, is spent wisely and prudently.''
   At the same time, the governor asked committee members to use
their resources to protect Utah's investment in the research.
   The committee was formed following the March 23 news conference
in which University of Utah researcher B. Stanley Pons and his
British colleague, Martin Fleischmann, announced they had sustained
a room temperature fusion reaction.
   A special session of the Legislature appropriated the $5 million
for further research and development.
   Committee Chairman Raymond L. Hixson, chief executive of the
Bonneville Pacific Corp., said the committee would meet Wednesday
to set an agenda.
   ``Our task is to try to move (cold fusion) from basic research
to practical application,'' he said. ``But first, we need to get as
broad an understanding of this process as we can.''
   It was too soon to say when funds would begin to be released, or
where, Hixson said.
   He said the committee hoped to meet with Pons and Fleischmann to
discuss their research, and eventually with scientists from other
institutions conducting similar work.
   Bangerter said he had recently returned from a tour of Japan,
Taiwan and Korea, where he found a great interest and enthusiasm
for the fusion research.

<HEAD>Liverpool Officials, Soccer Fans Deny Drunkenness Played Part in
Crush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Liverpool officials and survivors of a stadium
crush that killed 95 soccer fans denied police reports Wednesday
that hooliganism and drunkenness were factors in the disaster.
   Police in the northern city of Sheffield said more than a dozen
supporters of Liverpool's soccer team were arrested before
Saturday's game for public order offenses.
   Irvine Patnick, the governing Conservative Party's lawmaker in
Sheffield, said police told him ``they were hampered, harassed,
punched, kicked and urinated on by Liverpool fans'' as they
struggled to help the injured and dying.
   Eric Heffer, an opposition Labor Party member from Liverpool,
called Patnick's charges ``absolutely degrading and disgusting.''
   ``Mr. Patnick is suggesting that Liverpool people did the most
despicable things to their own people, when the whole of the
television (coverage) showed to the contrary,'' Heffer said in the
House of Commons, his voice trembling. Patnick was not in the house.
   Police have come under attack in the aftermath of the disaster
for unlocking a gate and allowing several thousand fans to pour
into an already crowded standing-room section at Hillsborough
stadium in Sheffield.
   The victims were trampled or crushed to death against an
anti-riot fence. Nineteen remained hospitalized Wednesday, nine in
intensive care. Most of the victims were fans of the Liverpool
team, which was playing a team from Nottingham Forest.
   Paul Middup, chairman of the South Yorkshire Police Federation,
the local police union chapter, told BBC-TV: ``We are quite
convinced that a lot of the fans _ many, many hundreds of them
outside that gate _ had been drinking very heavily.''
   But Dr. John Ashton of Liverpool University medical faculty, who
was at the match and attended the dying, said on TV Channel 4 News:
``I saw no evidence whatsoever of drunkenness, nor of looting nor
of people urinating on policemen.''
   The chief constable of South Yorkshire police, Peter Wright,
refused comment on the argument, saying he had ordered his officers
not to pre-empt an inquiry into police control of the crowd.
   A small crowd of Liverpudlians burned a stack of newspapers
Wednesday with the police claims on the front page.
   The team's stadium was carpeted with flowers, scarves and other
soccer memorabilia as scores of people continued paid tribute to
the dead.
   Liverpool City Council leader Kevas Coombes accused police of
spreading ``baseless, malicious and wicked'' allegations.
   ``None of these allegations were made at the time and any lawyer
will know that they have the hallmarks of an attempt to create a
cover story to cover for their incompetence,'' he said.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, whose department is in charge of
the police, and lawmaker David Blunkett, whose constituency
includes Sheffield stadium, both appealed for an end to
recriminations.
   ``It is sad and wrong that there were 24 hours of great dignity
and mourning _ and now as a country we seem to be plunging downhill
into a mess of accusations and counteraccusations which changed
that right atmosphere to the wrong,'' said Hurd.

   The search for two crewmen swept into the sea
after their ship sank continued a third day Wednesday, with
rescuers holding out hope that the temperate water of the Gulf
Stream might help the men survive.
   Spotters aboard a Coast Guard airplane were directing the Coast
Guard cutter Chilula in an area about 400 miles southeast of Cape
Cod, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Jeff Crawley.
   The cutter was carrying the 23 sailors who were rescued after
the freighter Star of Alexandria sank in stormy seas Monday morning.
   The crew of a search plane reported spotting one of the missing
crewmen Tuesday, but found no further signs, Crawley said.
   ``Both crewmen are being presumed to be alive,'' he said.
``They're near the Gulf Stream. The water temperature isn't that
cold.''
   Survivors said one of the missing men jumped overboard from the
sinking ship and appeared to be injured. The other was wearing a
life jacket when he was washed off a life raft.
   The 23 multinational crew members were picked up by the
freighter Ravenscraig, which was diverted to the scene the after
rescue planes spotted a life boat and a life raft. A second life
raft was recovered but was empty, Crawley said.
   The Chilula arrived at the search area Tuesday to collect the
rescued crewmen from the 950-foot Ravenscraig.
   Crawley said officials still didn't know what made the Star of
Alexandria sink.
   ``They had reported they were taking on water, why we don't
know,'' he said.
   The 500-foot freighter was bound for New York City from Athens,
Greece.
   The Star of Alexandria was registered in England and designed to
carry bulk freight. The ship is owned by Caribene Investments Ltd.
of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping
registry.

   A 34-year-old woman who disappeared
last summer may be the 11th victim of a serial killer or killers,
Bristol County authorities said Wednesday.
   The remains of eight women between the ages of 25 and 36 have
been found since July along highways near this port city 40 miles
south of Boston. Two other women are missing and feared dead.
   ``We are looking at the possibility of there being another
victim,'' said Jim Martin, spokesman for Bristol County District
Attorney Ronald Pina.
   Pina previously identified two of the missing women as Christina
Monteiro, 20, who vanished last May, and Sandra Botelho, 25, who
disappeared Aug. 11.
   The Boston Globe, citing unnamed sources, reported Wednesday
that the third missing woman was Marilyn Roberts, daughter of a
retired New Bedford police officer. Martin would not confirm the
identity but said the woman's family had provided information to
the district attorney.
   ``The family has said they have not seen or heard from her since
last summer,'' Martin said. ``They filed a missing person report
with the New Bedford police.''
   The Standard-Times of New Bedford reported that 34-year-old
Marilyn J. Roberts was initially reported missing in April 1988,
but was seen in the city in June. Her family reported her missing
again in December after reports of the highway killings.
   Roberts had ties to the city's drug community, as did the eight
victims and the two other missing women, The Globe and The Standard
Times reported.
   The Standard-Times said Roberts was a heroin addict and had been
arrested on drug charges in 1984 and 1985, but unlike some of the
other victims, she had no record of prostitution.
   A grand jury, which was first convenced in February to hear
evidence in the case, is scheduled to reconvene on April 27.
   The investigation has produced four suspects, but no arrests
have been made.

<TEXT>
   The federal government is shortchanging the
nation's second-largest city in the fight against drugs because of
an East Coast bias, officials based here said.
   ``The West Coast has not been heard politically as much as the
East Coast,'' John Zietner, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's Los Angeles office, said Tuesday in a presentation
before the Board of Supervisors.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner called for more federal resources,
saying that Los Angeles has become one of the nation's main sources
for drugs.
   He noted that he has 141 lawyers on his staff, compared to 240
in metropolitan New York, and the DEA has 83 agents in Los Angeles
County, compared to 341 assigned in Miami and 301 in New York.
   Supervisor Deane Dana criticized drug czar William Bennett's
selection of Washington as a test case for the Bush
administration's anti-drug efforts.
   ``They are doing it because Congress is there hearing the
gunshots. But the gunshots are no less deadly here in Los
Angeles,'' said Dana.
   Bennet's spokesman, Larry Cirignano, responded, ``It didn't make
any sense to fly to Los Angeles to look at the drug problem when we
have one in our own back yard.''

   The Senate Labor and Human Resources approved
a bill Wednesday to require large employers to provide up to 10
weeks of unpaid leave for parents of new babies.
   The vote was 10-6.
   The bill, similar to a measure awaiting House floor action, also
would require employers to make 10 weeks available for workers to
care for a seriously ill child or parent.
   And it would require them to grant up to 13 weeks a year unpaid
leave in the even of serious illness of the employee.
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., would apply to
employers of 20 or more people.
   Similar Dodd legislation cleared the committee last year, but
failed to overcome an informal filibuster mounted by Republican
opponents on the floor.
   Parental leave legislation is a main part of the overall
Democratic domestic agenda this year _ along the minimum wage,
federal child care and health care for the uninsured.
   Party leaders have agreed informally that the House will go
first this year with its version of the parental leave bill.
Parental leave legislation was not considered by the full House
last year.

   The National Institute of Standards and
Technology burned 500 pounds of wood in an old Capitol Hill hotel
Wednesday in an experiment to help decide whether it's worthwhile
to try to control smoke in building fires.
   The institute's system confined smoke from the fire to one floor
of the seven-story brick building, which was studded throughout
with more than 100 temperature-measuring devices and other
instruments measuring air pressure and gas concentrations.
   The institute, known until recently as the National Bureau of
Standards, is part of the Commerce Department.
   Smoke control systems have come into increasing use in office
buildings over the past decade, but officials of the institute said
such systems had not been challenged extensively by real fires.
What systems there are have been constructed according to
theoretical calculations and rules of thumb drawn up by fire
experts.
   The cause of many fire fatalities is listed as ``smoke
inhalation,'' which frequently may be carbon monoxide from
incomplete combustion or other toxic gases given off by a fire.
   Much of the $40 billion in annual property damage from fires
also results from smoke, and ``it doesn't take much to gum up your
computer disks'' even if the flames never get close, observed Jack
Snell, director of the institute's Center for Fire Research.
   ``The big question in the fire protection field is, Does smoke
control work? And under what circumstances does it make sense to
add it to building requirements?'' Snell told reporters attending
the demonstration burn at the old Plaza Hotel between the Capitol
and Union Station. The building is to be demolished.
   Some experts question whether sprinkler-protected buildings need
a smoke control system. To work properly, such systems must supply
air to the fire, which may make it grow ``and these are the
tradeoffs,'' said Snell.
   Smoke control works by using a building's existing air-handling
system to pressurize the stairwells and the floors above and below
the fire floor. Existing fire sensors can be used to trigger the
proper arrangement of fans.
   In Washington, the Senate Hart Office Building and the Madison
Building of the Library of Congress have smoke control systems.
John Klute, director of Wednesday's experiment, said such systems
should add ``a small fraction'' to the cost of ventilation systems.
   In Wednesday's test, 2,000 cubic-feet-per-minute fans pumped air
into the first and third floors of the hotel while a fan of the
same size withdraw air from the second floor, where a pyre of 2
inch-by-2 inch fir sticks burned in a fireproofed room about 10
feet by 11 feet in front of an open windown about four feet square.
   A fan of 9,000 cubic feet per minute pressurized the single
stairwell in the building.
   The open window made it ``the most severe test so far,'' said
Klute. This meant the difference in air pressure between the fire
floor and the adjacent floors would be about half the difference
recommended for current smoke control schemes.
   Flames and black smoke denoting incomplete combustion poured out
of the open window and licked the window above. At one point, the
temperature sensor closest to the fire indicated 2,696 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the carbon monoxide content of the hallway was
shown as almost 0.5 percent _ half what it had been in previous
tests of fires in the hallway with all windows closed.
   But television monitors on every floor and every landing of the
stairwell showed no smoke throughout the test, even though the
second-floor hallway was full of opaque smoke above a few inches
off the floor at 6 minutes 43 seconds after ignition, and
completely full shortly after that.

<HEAD>New Ad Campaigns in Abortion Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One week before the Supreme Court hears
arguments in a key abortion-rights case, an abortion rights group
Wednesday took to the airwaves with a $2 million ad campaign while
an anti-abortion group said it plans to run newspaper ads next week
to stir America's grass roots.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League Wednesday began
running television, radio and newspaper ads to present their side
and build on the energy displayed at an abortion-rights march that
drew at least 300,000 to the nation's Capitol earlier this month.
   Meantime, the American Civil Liberties Union plans on Thursday
to deliver more than 200,000 letters to the Justice Department on
Thursday asking the department to drop its attempt to persuade the
Supreme Court to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   The NARAL ads are designed ``to awaken America's pro-choice
majority _ the sleeping giant that is just now hearing the alarm,''
said Kate Michelman, executive director of NARAL.
   The ads were being run in four state capital cities _
Sacramento, Calif.; Des Moines, Iowa; Raleigh, N.C.; and Austin,
Texas. On Sunday, the ads will begin in Washington, D.C., and
nationally on Cable News Network, she said.
   NARAL's ads warn that without safe, legal abortions, women will
be forced to turn to ``back alley'' abortions, and say the choice
of whether to have an abortion should be made by women and their
families, not the government.
   Michelman said the ad campaign is a first of its kind for the
group, warranted by the imminent danger to abortion rights posed by
a Missouri case that will be heard by the high court.
   Though many doubt the court in this case will reverse its
landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized first-trimester
abortions, many say the court could allow states to impose more
restrictions on abortions.
   Oral arguments are scheduled for April 26.
   The National Right to Life Committee said it is planning to run
a four-page insert in USA Today on April 25 and to run the ad in
other papers around the country after that, said Dan Donehey, a
spokesman for the group.
   Donehey, who estimated the cost of the campaign at $150,000,
said the ads will include information on the types of abortion
procedures performed, the developmental characteristics of a fetus,
the effect of abortion on women and profiles of women who carried
babies to term instead of aborting them.
   Michelman said her group's ad campaign is not intended to lobby
the Supreme Court, but she said the court ``is not immune to the
social values and political environment of the country.''
   Leonard Dinegar, a National Right to Life Committee spokesman,
said his group isn't trying to sway the high court, but wants to
take advantage of the attention it has focused on the abortion
issue.
   ``This is the best time to educate people on the issue because
it's so hot right now,'' he said. etters,xxx

   The Justice Department filed a brief with the Supreme Court
regarding the Missouri case of Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services that not only asked the top court to uphold a Missouri law
but asked that it upend the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision as well.
   Actor Ed Asner, actress Polly Bergen, Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo, and ACLU executive director Ira Glasser will present the
letters to the Justice Department on Thursday, Colleen O'Connor of
the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday.
   The ``extraordinary outpouring'' of 200,000 letters ``represents
a public uprising against the notion of an established right being
taken away,'' Glasser said in an interview from his New York office.
   ``When you have as many people as this willing to put themselves
on the line to resist the taking away of their rights, it is a
political uprising that they ought to pay attention to and be
sensitive to,'' Glasser said. ``We hope that they'll let this case
be decided on the merits and not make what we believe is a narrow
and partisan-based political decision.''

<HEAD>Academy Members Criticize Georgia Clash, Law on Dissident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov's campaign speech before fellow
Soviet scientists was upstaged Wednesday when one of his colleagues
publicly apologized for denouncing the nuclear physicist nine years
ago.
   Sakharov is running for one of the seats in the new Soviet
parliament reserved for the Academy of Sciences. He and other
reformist candidates at Wednesday's election meeting criticized a
new decree on dissent and authorities for the deaths of 20
protesters in a clash in Soviet Georgia.
   The scientist who followed the human rights activist to the
podium at Moscow State University, however, was the one who
electrified the hall.
   The elderly man, who identified himself only as Vonsovsky, said
he was ashamed to admit that he signed a letter to the Soviet
Presidium denouncing Sakharov after the physicist criticized the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979.
   ``I committed a very bad act,'' Vonsovsky said in front of
hundreds of top Soviet scientists. ``I am offering a profound
apology.''
   ``I would like to say that Sakharov is our honor, our pride, and
our conscience,'' Vonsovsky said.
   The Presidium cited such letters when it stripped Sakharov of
his numerous awards and accused him of subversion in early 1980. He
was exiled from Moscow to the provincial city of Gorky. In 1986, he
was freed when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power and
began releasing dissidents.
   The academy is scheduled to vote Thursday to fill the 12 of its
20 seats in the Congress of People's Deputies that were left empty
after its first round of voting last month.
   In his speech, Sakharov said an April 8 decree barring ``insults
and discrediting'' of the government should be rescinded. He also
criticized laws that allow authorities to use special troops to
clear demonstrations.
   Critics charge that by banning statements that discredit Soviet
officials, the new decree threatens citizens with prison or fines
for speaking the truth about officials who do their jobs poorly.
   Sakharov also blamed the April 9 tragedy in Tbilisi, the capital
of Soviet Georgia, on such laws and on forces opposing perestroika,
Gorbachev's drive to restructure Soviet society.
   Hundreds of academy members voted to support a resolution of its
branch in Georgia that termed the April 9 clash an ``unprecedented
massive beating of innocent people.''
   At least 20 people died when soldiers moved into a crowd of
demonstrators on Tbilisi's main street. A commission is
investigating charges that soldiers used poison gas, shovels and
clubs.
   The academy holds 20 seats in the Congress of People's Deputies
that will meet for the first time on May 25.
   Of the congress' 2,250 seats, 750 will be held by members
elected from the Communist Party and its affiliates, trade unions,
social and professional organizations like the Academy of Sciences.
   Elections in 1,500 geographical districts were held March 26.
   Sakharov's supporters organized a campaign against the 23
candidates chosen by the academy's election commission for the 20
seats and in voting last month succeeded in preventing 15 of them
from getting 50 percent of the vote.
   The academy was required to organize a second election, and last
week Sakharov was chosen to be among the 28 nominees.

<HEAD>Judge Allows New Witness at Hijacker's Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge delayed final arguments
Wednesday in the trial of confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali
Hamadi and allowed his attorney to call a new witness to the stand.
   Rainer Hamm, lawyer for the family of Robert D. Stethem,
objected to bringing in the new witness and accused defense
lawmakers of intentionally delaying the trial, which began July 5,
1988.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger dismissed the objection and
scheduled testimony from the witness, a reporter for the BBC, for
Monday and postponed the trial until then.
   The judge at the courtroom in Preungesheim Prison in Frankfurt
had hoped to begin hearing closing arguments by the prosecution
Wednesday.
   Hamadi's lawyer, Hans-Burkhardt Steck, told the court he wanted
BBC reporter John Simpson, who was in Algiers, Algeria, during the
hijacking of TWA Flight 847 in June 1985 ``to give an account of
what went on in Algiers'' when the plane was forced to land there.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with air piracy and
murder in the hijacking in which 23-year-old Stethem was shot to
death and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   The plane, seized on a flight from Athens to Rome on June 14,
1985, shuttled between Beirut and Algiers before returning to the
Lebanese capital for the third time.
   Stethem, the only casualty, was shot when the plane landed the
second time at Beirut.
   Hamadi's lawyer said Simpson was in Algiers during both landings
of TWA Flight 847.
   He said the defense hoped Simpson could refute earlier testimony
by a West German federal police investigator that Hamadi and his
accomplice ``made threats and had a heated argument with Algiers
control tower to obtain fuel'' for a return flight to Beirut.
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem of Waldorf, Md.,
have attended the trial since it began.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka Cease-Fire Ends, No Accord with Sinhalese Radicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's weeklong cease-fire
ended Wednesday with Sinhalese radicals demanding a pullout of
Indian troops and new elections before any peace talks.
   ``It is pointless carrying a gun in one hand and calling for
peace talks with the other,'' said a statement issued by the
People's Liberation Front, the main militant group of the majority
Sinhalese.
   The government extended the cease-fire to both ethnic Tamil
rebels fighting for a homeland and militant Sinhalese who want
tougher measures against the Tamils. Despite escalated violence
that left 100 people dead over the past week, Tamil militants said
Saturday they were ready for talks on ending their six-year-long
insurgency.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa ordered suspension of military
operations against the extremists to give them a chance to
surrender and join the political mainstream.
   Militant Sinhalese said talks should wait until new
parliamentary and presidential elections are held and Indian troops
leave the country. They also demanded disbanding of vigilante
groups blamed for killing suspected militants in the
Sinhalese-dominated south.
   The government reacted by calling on the militants to hold
preliminary negotiations anyway.
   ``It is appropriate that an informal discussion is held on
preliminary issues that would ... create a basis of trust as a
prerequisite for a dialogue,'' said Foreign Minister Ranjan
Wijeratna. He made no comment on the militant demands.
   The Tamil militants have appointed Anton Balasingham, a Sri
Lankan-born Tamil who is a British citizen, to start the peace
talks. Balasingham, the recently named head of the rebels'
political section, is expected to arrive soon from London,
according to presidential spokesman Evans Cooray. No date has been
announced for the talks.
   Military officials said 233 Sinhalese radicals surrendered
during the cease-fire. No Tamil militants surrendered, they said.
   Sinhalese extremists launched their anti-government campaign in
1987 after former President Junius R. Jayewardene signed an
India-sponsored peace accord with Tamil rebels. The Sinhalese
radicals said the pact, which called for greater Tamil autonomy,
made too many concessions to the Tamils.
   The rebels later renounced the accord and began fighting Indian
peacekeeping troops sent to Sri Lanka to promote the plan. India
became involved in the ethnic tensions of this island off its
southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million
Tamils for the rebels.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They complain of discrimination in jobs and
education and demand a northeastern homeland.
   Sri Lanka's government and military has been dominated by the
Sinhalese since the island, formerly called Ceylon, became
independent from Britain in 1948. Sinhalese, who are predominantly
Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the population.
   About 12,600 people have died in the ethnic violence over the
past six years.

<HEAD>Optimism on US Base Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Pacific Command said
Wednesday he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the Philippines will
agree to a new pact on U.S. bases there but acknowledged that
political sentiment against the facilities is growing.
   Adm. Huntington Hardisty, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific
Command, said he believes the two countries can agree on an
extension to the pact when the lease expires on the six bases
expires in 1991.
   ``Everyone has an interest in the United States remaining in the
Philippines,'' Hardisty told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
``We're good friends, we're good allies and I hope that
relationship will continue.''
   The admiral said he was ``cautiously optimistic that in 1991 we
can reach a favorable renegotiation of the military base
agreement.''
   But under questioning from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Hardisty
said he concurred with Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel's
statement that political opposition to the bases is increasing.
   ``I don't disagree with that assessment but I think reason will
prevail in 1991,'' he said. ``I think we've seen a lot of rhetoric
and a lot of posturing against the Aquino government.''
   Hardisty added that Laurel ``has a political agenda as well.''
   Laurel resigned as foreign secretary in September 1987, citing
differences with President Corazon Aquino over the 20-year battle
against a communist insurgency and other issues, including economic
development in the poor nation.
   Laurel, who was in Washington this week, said that although the
public favors the U.S. presence, a strong anti-American sentiment
is growing in the Philippine Senate. According to law, two-thirds
of the 23-member Senate must ratify a U.S.-Philippine treaty on
military bases.
   Presently, the United States maintains Clark Air Base and Subic
Bay Naval Base, two of its largest facilities overseas, and four
smaller installations. More than 60,000 Filipinos are employed at
the bases, where about 40,000 U.S. troops and their dependents are
stationed.

   John Goodman, who plays the husband on the
television show ``Roseanne,'' will get some real life experience
for his role.
   ``He is officially engaged and has been since Saturday when John

Stan Rosenfield, Goodman's agent, said Wednesday from Hollywood.
   The bride-to-be is Annabeth Hartzog, a model and college student

Louisiana filming ``Everybody's All American,'' Rosenfield said.
   The wedding will be in October in New Orleans. However,
``because of the enormous amount of curiosity about them, they will
not announce the date. They don't want a recurrence of the Sean

   Reporters and photographers disrupted that wedding when they

   An Amoco Corp. jet carrying the company's
president and five other people landed safely Wednesday after
circling for nearly five hours because of a problem with its nose
landing gear, officials said.
   The Gulfstream III twin-engine jet took off about 5:30 a.m. from
Midway Airport with three company executives, including President
H. Laurance Fuller, and three crew members en route to Asia by way
of Anchorage, Alaska, said Amoco spokesman Mike Thompson.
   ``It landed without incident at 10:32 a.m.,'' at O'Hare
International Airport, said Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   ``The nose gear never retracted,'' Edelstein said. ``They
requested a flyby from the control tower, and they looked with
binoculars and said `no, it has not retracted.'''
   The $19 million jet circled Midway for about 4{ hours in 40-mile
circles to burn off fuel before heading to O'Hare for the landing,
Edelstein said.
   ``It's a standard thing to do,'' he said. ``In the case of a
crash, there's a better chance for survival'' if the fuel tanks are
empty.
   He said pilots prefer the additional emergency equipment and
longer runways that make O'Hare safer for emergency landings.
   Edelstein said the nose-gear failure could have been caused by a
mechanic forgetting to take out a pin.

<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officials refused
Wednesday to confirm published reports of a planned terrorist
attack here, but some resort patrons said they noticed tighter
security in the city's 12 casinos.
   Casino operators and Boardwalk vendors reported business as
usual despite reports that police were looking for two Arab men
planning a terrorist attack. The reports were linked to anonymous
sources in Wednesday's editions of The Star-Ledger of Newark and
The Press of Atlantic City.
   State police on Wednesday monitored the three main roads into
Atlantic City. Plainclothes State Police detectives increased their
surveillance of casinos, according to the two newspapers.
   The assault was scheduled sometime from April 14 to April 20,
the newspapers said. Authorities said the attack was to be in
retaliation for the U.S. bombing on April 15, 1986, of Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi's headquarters, according to the newspapers.
   Two weeks ago, a British newspaper reported that Libya planned
attacks on U.S. airlines and other American targets to mark the
anniversary of the bombing.
   Libya's news agency JANA has denied the reports, which were tied
to a senior U.S. intelligence official.
   Spokesmen for the FBI and Atlantic City Police Chief Joseph
Pasquale declined to comment on the case. State Police
Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano refused to comment on whether
his force was on alert.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito declined comment Wednesday, but
noted that one year ago, alleged terrorist Yu Kikumura was arrested
on the New Jersey Turnpike.
   In February, Kikumura was sentenced to 30 years in prison on
explosives and weapons charges.
   ``I think we showed he was going to carry out his bombing
mission on April 14,'' Alito said. ``We are now just about a year
later. Whatever inferences anybody wants to draw from that they
can.''
   Thomas Carver, president of the Atlantic City Casino
Association, refused to say whether casinos had increased security
or police had added patrols. He also declined to speculate on the
effects the newspaper report would have on visitors.
   ``I think the weather has more to do with the attendance in
Atlantic City than anything else,'' Carver said.
   Operators of some Boardwalk businesses and casinos said the
customer flow was normal Wednesday.
   Circe Stein, manager of Duke Mack's, a popular restaurant on the
Boardwalk, said some of her customers noticed additional security
measures at casinos and on the highways. But she said there was no
decrease in patrons.
   ``We're still working our tails off,'' she said.
   At TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort, business was
``absolutely status quo for Wednesdays,'' said casino spokesman Jim
Wise.
   ``It's absolutely business as usual,'' said Trump Plaza
spokesman Gary Selesner. ``We are not aware of any cancellations
due to the bomb threat.''

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Students at the North Carolina School
of the Arts staged a ``Bard-a-thon'' as well as mime and dance
shows and an oboe concert to demonstrate their unhappiness with the
school's chancellor.
   After months of complaints by faculty and students, Chancellor
Jane Milley has resigned, effective June 30, from the top job at
the school, part of the University of North Carolina System.
   The school's Faculty Council voted 11-0 last March to call for
her resignation; the council had taken a no-confidence vote in
November, too, in which it was joined by 85 of 89 faculty members.
   The university system's Board of Governors voted this month to
give Ms. Milley, 48, a paid leave of absence and then appoint her
as a music instructor, beginning Jan. 1, at a salary of $58,600, or
$6,000 higher than the music dean's. Her chancellor's salary is
$86,000.
   However, students at the school said they didn't like the deal;
this week, they took to the streets.
   First, a student sat in the chancellor's parking space and
played an oboe.
   Next, students staged the ``Bard-a-thon'' _ a reading of
Shakespeare's 154 sonnets and 13 plays. Other performance protests
included chamber music concerts, interpretive dance in front of a
banner proclaiming ``Milley Must Go,'' and juggling.
   On Tuesday, Peter Hedges, a former drama student at the school,
stood on a outdoor stage and read telegrams from Oscar-nominee Tom
Hulce, television star Tim Guinee and Broadway actress Joan Allen
in support of the students.
   ``We're not trying to railroad her out of town,'' said Nathan
``Cory'' Seymour, 26, a graduate student in technical direction and
production management and one of the organizers of the protest.
``We just want her to relinquish her power now.''
   In 1984, Ms. Milley was named chancellor, the first non-composer
to hold the post. Soon after her appointment, her management style
came in for criticism as being abrasive and crisis-oriented.
Critics also said she wouldn't delegate authority.

<TEXT>
   Salvador Laurel, the Philippine vice president
at odds with President Corazon Aquino, described himself on
Wednesday as being in ``a state of suspended animation'' as he
prepares a bid for his nation's top office.
   Laurel, who spoke with reporters at the National Press Club, is
visiting Washington to meet with congressional leaders and
highlight his views in advance of next month's national convention
of the opposition Nacionalista Party.
   He has said he expects to be one of several candidates who are
going to ``throw their hat in the ring'' for the 1992 presidential
elections. Although Mrs. Aquino has said she will not seek
re-election, it is possible that she may be drafted to run again.
   Relations are so poor between Mrs. Aquino and her vice president
that they do not speak.
   Although Laurel said his visit was not geared around criticism
at Mrs. Aquino, the majority of his statements found fault with her
government's battle against the nation's 20-year-old communist
insurgency, as well as the approach to economic and political
development.
   In contrast to the U.S. system of government, the Philippine
vice president has no duties under the constitution unless
appointed to a position by the president. After a political falling
out in 1987, Laurel resigned his post as foreign minister and
lately has been organizing an opposition party.
   ``I'm in a state of suspended animation,'' he said.
   Still, he quipped, ``as a jobless vice president, I'm able to
travel more than others'' and visit with citizens.
   As for the insurgency, Laurel said rebel numbers have ballooned
from 14,000 to 33,000 in the past three years.
   ``If we don't put up a responsible, democratic opposition, the
alternative we face is a violent opposition,'' he said.
   A State Department official familiar with the situation in the
Philippines said, however, that the insurgency was not that large
and that it ``hasn't made any particular progress'' over the past
several years. The official commented on condition he not be named.
   The vice president also said he differed with Mrs. Aquino on the
issue of the negotiation of the future of U.S. bases in the
Philippines and he criticized a lack of movement on the issue.
   He argued that the Philippine government should enter into
negotiations with the United States as soon as possible, since the
pact expires in 1991.
   Laruel did say Mrs. Aquino deserved credit for helping the
nation through a rocky three years since former dictator Ferdinand
Marcos left the country. A civilian-military uprising in February
1986 ended Marcos' rule and swept Mrs. Aquino and Laurel into power.
   But Laurel argued that ``the transition from dictatorship to
democracy'' won't be complete without the formation of a
``responsible, legitimate, organized opposition,'' which he said
his party intends to be.

<HEAD>Truckers Group Says Many International Containers Overweight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overloaded container trucks carrying European
beer, paper products and ceramic tiles are violating U.S. highway
regulations and endangering trucking safety, a truckers group told
Congress Wednesday.
   Thomas J. Donohue, head of the American Trucking Associations,
said the heavy containers packed in Europe increase stopping
distances, decrease vehicle control and put additional stress on
American trucks.
   Donohue said beer imports from Holland top the list of
potentially overweight containers, followed by paper products and
ceramic tile imported from various countries.
   ``By allowing imports such as beer to move at higher weights
than those allowed domestic products, the U.S. is, in effect,
providing an economic subsidy to foreign competitors,'' Donohue
told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
   He said the Federal Highway Administration lacks authority to
regulate the containers because they are only illegal when they are
carried on the highways, where enforcement agents fine truckers for
the overweight cargoes.
   Donohue said a recent study by the highway administration
indicates that a third of all import and export containers moving
through U.S. ports are in possible violation of federal highway
weight limits. The top violator among shipments for export is waste
paper, he said.

   Soldiers fired on protesters who defied a
military curfew Wednesday night and demanded the resignation of
Jordan's prime minister. Witnesses said three people were killed.
   Officials said at least 18 people have been injured in two days
of rioting in the city of Maan, 120 miles south of Amman. The
rioting, prompted by price increases and an economic austerity
agreement with the International Monetary Fund, spread to at least
three other towns.
   The violence appeared to be the worst in Jordan since the army
crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1970-71 and drove them from the
country.
   A police source said a 21-year-old army soldier on leave was
fatally wounded in Maan. The source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, identified the man as Ahmed Matlab Saudi.
   Saudi was on the roof of his house, watching protesters stoning
government buildings and destroying police cars, when he was hit by
a stray bullet, the source said.
   The source could not confirm the two other deaths.
   But residents in Maan, also speaking privately, said the two
were among the protesters who took to the streets despite the
curfew to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai.
They would not give details.
   King Hussein and Rifai were in Washington to discuss
Arab-Israeli peace efforts with President Bush. Asked about the
disturbances, the monarch told reporters, ``Everything is under
control.''
   Earlier Wednesday, the government deployed a massive force of
police and soldiers, some in armored cars and wearing riot gear,
along major highways.
   But the unrest spread to Tafilah, 80 miles south of Amman, and
Husnyeih, 95 miles from the capital. These two cities and Maan
remained under curfew, but residents reached by telephone said
gunfire could be heard all afternoon.
   Witnesses said hundreds of rioters on Wednesday attacked at
least seven banks in Kerak, 50 miles south of Amman. The streets of
the city were filled with army officers, lined with charred
buildings and littered with metallic debris.
   Windows of several government offices were smashed, and at least
three burned cars lay at the entrance of the city.
   Crown Prince Hassan, acting as head of state in the king's
absence, told reporters that 12 policemen and six civilians were
injured in Maan. He said arrests were made but did not say how many.
   Jordan has experienced little turmoil for 15 years, in large
measure because of a rapid increase in living standards and
education financed by aid from Arab oil states. That aid has
declined recently, and the country has a $6 billion debt.
   Officials said trouble began when taxi drivers roused students
to riot on Tuesday because the drivers were angered by a 25 percent
increase in the price of gasoline, to the equivalent of $1.65 a
gallon, and a doubling of the annual license fee to $370.
   Tires smoldered in Maan's streets and young men changed demands
for the resignation of Rifai, whose government announced price
increases Sunday for gasoline, auto licenses and other items.
   Some chanted: ``This man must resign or we will burn the
country!''
   ``This govenment is all thieves!'' declared a youth who gave his
name as Mahmoud, face shrouded by an Arab scarf and hands black
with the soot of burning tires.
   Price increases are part of a deal with the IMF to reduce budget
deficits and reschedule the foreign debt. They follow a year of
rising unemployment and rapid inflation in which the dinar lost
nearly 40 percent of its buying power, often doubling the prices of
such imported goods as cars and appliances.
   Wages have not risen to compensate and the government also has
cut overtime and other benefits for public employees. Most
Jordanians earn between $185 and $370 a month.

   A plan to integrate Louisiana's public
universities has the potential to halt generations of racial
disparity, state officials said Wednesday.
   A special master appointed by a panel of federal judges
recommended Tuesday that the state set up a single governing board
for higher education, raise admission standards for some schools
and make Louisiana State University the primary research school.
   The proposal also called for establishing a community college
system and providing a specific percentage of each year's higher
education budget for predominantly black colleges.
   The plan generally was well received by state officials. ``I
think the students won,'' said Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   ``I'm for it if it will improve the education of our students in
Louisiana, if LSU will be enhanced as the flagship university and
if we can provide a good education for our young people at a
reduced cost,'' said Jack Andonie, chairman of the LSU Board of
Supervisors.
   Louisiana currently has four boards of higher education
overseeing 17 institutions. Under the plan proposed by Special
Master Paul Verkuil, president of William and Mary College in
Virginia, those boards would merge into one unified governing body
with 17 voting members and a student member.
   Verkuil was appointed after black leaders, educators and
politicians were unable to reach an agreement to end a 15-year-old
lawsuit brought against the state by the U.S. Justice Department.
   Since December 1987, the state of Louisiana, the Justice
Department, Southern University and the Grambling Alumni
Association have been trying to come up with a desegregation
proposal after an earlier settlement expired.
   Black leaders had feared a single higher education board would
be insensitive to the needs of Louisiana's two major predominantly
black universities, Grambling State University in north Louisiana,
and the Southern University System based in Baton Rouge.
   Grambling is governed by the Board of Regents and Board of
Trustees, which oversees most of the predominantly white
institutions. Southern has its own governing board.
   A three-judge federal panel that appointed Verkuil will have the
final say on the proposal.
   The plan rejected the notion of closing or merging state
universities for the time being, perhaps the most dreaded aspect of
the desegregation talks.
   The governor got much of what the state wanted from the
negotiations, including the superboard, which he was unable to push
through the Legislature last year.
   ``We asked that the schools not be closed, but that the boards
be merged, and the master has done this,'' Roemer said. ``He gave
us some guidelines. Now we'll have to work with the Legislature to
see how much and how far he has gone.''
   ``It may do for Louisiana what we could not do because of the
politics of the circumstances,'' namely the competition among the
college systems, said state Sen. Armand Brinkhaus, chairman of the
Senate Education Committee.
   Brinkhaus compared the situation to the public school
desegregation fights of the 1960s when federal court orders
overrode state law.
   ``We need to integrate our colleges. All of our citizens need to
have the same opportunities,'' Andonie said. ``But I don't know if
the plan is going to work.''
   A representative of the Board of Trustees for State Colleges and
Universities said Verkuil has given the state an opportunity to
properly integrate its higher education institutions.
   ``He has done it very wisely,'' said David McCormick, vice
president for academic and research affairs. ``He did what the
governor asked. He said, `Let me get my one board in place and give
that board the responsibility for doing these things.'''
   Sally Clausen, commissioner of higher education, said, ``My
initial reaction is this is probably the least disruptive set of
recommendations that holds promise for desegregation and increased
accessibility.''

<HEAD>Investigations Ordered Into Reports of Intimidation in Namibia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. officials and the South
African-appointed territorial administrator ordered separate
investigations on Wednesday into reports of intimidation of
civilians in northern Namibia.
   Reports said security forces and supporters of the South-West
Africa People's Organization were harassing villagers in the area
of heavy fighting between the South African-controlled police and
military and the black nationalist guerrillas. Most allegations
dealt with security forces.
   Martti Ahtisaari, who heads the U.N. operation in Namibia,
ordered an inquiry because of ``increasing numbers of allegations
of intimidation, assault and other misconduct,'' said U.N.
spokesman Cedric Thornberry. He would not elaborate.
   Later, Louis Pienaar, who will administer the South-African
controlled territory until completion of a U.N.-supervised
independence process next year, said he also would set up a
commission to investigate the allegations.
   U.N. police monitors are to be deployed in northern Namibia this
week and residents have been urged to report incidents of
harassment or brutality.
   South Africa, which has ruled the territory for 74 years, has
agreed to implement a U.N. independence plan in Namibia, Africa's
last colony.
   South Africa says about 1,600 SWAPO guerrillas entered Namibia
starting April 1 in violation of an agreement that they remain at
their bases in Angola until at least mid-May. According to South
Africa, 279 guerrillas were killed; 32 captured; about 380 returned
to Angola, and about 900 remain in Namibia.
   The deputy commander of the U.N. forces, Brig. Gen. Daniel
Opande, said up to 800 insurgents have withdrawn to Angola.
Thornberry said the United Nations now has personnel at SWAPO bases
in Angola.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Tuesday that
unless all SWAPO guerrillas withdraw from Namibia by the end of
April, the timetable for removing South African troops from the
territory will be abandoned.
   He said the U.N. plan for bringing independence to Namibia was
still on schedule.
   SWAPO has fought South African rule since 1966.
   South Africa agreed to implement independence in exchange for
Cuba's withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.

   President Bush the tourguide was at it again
Wednesday, this time taking his guest for a spin on the Potomac
River in a yacht _ snatched from drug dealers and fit for a king.
   Continuing a practice of taking Middle Eastern leaders on
sightseeing trips around Washington, Bush hosted Jordan's King
Hussein by making use of a yacht, now owned by the U.S. Navy. Bush
has shown a penchant of late for making sure his foreign guests get
a taste of the tourist sights.
   The president took Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to the
season opener baseball game in Baltimore two weeks ago. Bush then
showed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir the Air and Space
Museum, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the capital.
   Hussein's tour began with a historical tone.
   Before their cruise, the king and Bush flew by helicopter to
nearby Mt. Vernon, the sprawling Virginia riverside estate of
George Washington. There, with an entourage of about 30 people,
they toured the home while tourists waited outside on the spacious
grounds.
   Then Bush and Hussein, trailed by a column of aides whose dark
suits contrasted with the flowering trees and springtime greenery,
descended a brick walkway to the Potomac River where they received
a lively sendoff from the Fife and Drum Corps of the Old Guard, 3rd
U.S. Infantry. The fife and drum band was dressed in American
Revolution costumes, with three-corner hats and red jackets.
   As how he liked his Mt.Vernon tour, Hussein smiled broadly and
said, ``I enjoyed it very, very much.''
   The two leaders boarded a 61-foot yacht named the Cinclantflt
Barge for the 10-mile ride back to Washington. Confiscated from
drug dealers in Florida, the craft, equipped with a bar and other
luxuries, is used for special functions of the chief of naval
operations, according to Coast Guard crew members who accompanied
the Bush tour.
   Bush and Hussein remained inside the yact, seated around a
conference table bedecked with a bowlof red roses and pink
carnations. Among those accompanying Bush were Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   If Hussein glanced out the porthole, he could have seen the
luxurious homes along the riverbanks, the Revolutionary War-era
Fort Washington and the historic harbor of Alexandria, Va.
   The sceneary Wednesday also included a burning automobile on the
Wilson Bridge, just about wheere the Cinclanflt passed.
   A handful of police boats, including a District of Columbia
fireboat called the John Glenn, shooed away fishing and
recreational boats and kept two large tour boats at dock until the
presidents passed.
   After more than an hour of 12-knot travel, the Bush yacht
anchored at Bolling Air Force Base, just south of the capital, and
Hussein headed off for lunch with Vice President Dan Quayle and
Bush returned to meetings at the White House.

   When Paul Glaros arrived for a convention this
week, he made sure he had the right equipment: magic wands, fake
flies and red noses.
   More than 1,000 amateur and professional pranksters from North
America and Europe were expected to attend the World Clown
Association's national convention, which began Wednesday, and runs
through Sunday.
   ``Look!'' Glaros, 65, said in a child's voice as he reached into
a big paper bag. ``I brought my peanut-buckle-and-jerry sandwich.
   ``Owwwwww!'' he cried as he removed his hand, to which an
oversized mousetrap was attached.
   Glaros and his 34-year-old wife, April, are proprietors as well
as performers.
   The Snap-Trap painless mousetrap is one of the premier products
sold by the couple's Norfolk, Va., business, Mirth For All Reasons.
   Other silly supplies include plastic whistles, magic hats,
flowers-from-a-hanky kits, and color-changing balls.

   Everybody gets a date to the prom at tiny
Aquin Central Catholic High School, but the ordeal of picking your
partner is replaced by the luck of the draw.
   Aquin's 63-year-old Prom Draw gives every girl a shot at going
to the prom with the football captain and every boy a chance to
date the head cheerleader. Boy's names, each in a sealed envelope,
are drawn from a plastic milk crate, then matched with girl's names
drawn from another crate.
   The parochial school's version of ``The Dating Game'' started
late last week with 32 junior and senior boys bunched anxiously on
wooden bleachers at the gym.
   ``For some of you, this will be the most agonizing 45 minutes
you'll go through in a while _ enjoy it,'' said Bill Pospischil,
athletic director at the 113-student school.
   After the drawing, he said, each boy should go to the cafeteria,
where 32 Aquin girls waited, and ask for a date from the girl they
draw.
   ``What if they say no?'' asked junior Jeff Franz, a bunch of
flowers by his sneaker-clad feet.
   ``They will not say no,'' replied Pospischil, as he reached into
a crate to draw the first name.
   The system sounds like one that teen-agers might hate, but every
time students get a chance to vote on it, they overwhelmingly
approve it, said school officials in this northwestern Illinois
city.
   ``The good thing about it is it's exciting and everyone gets a
chance to go,'' said Amy Schopf, a junior. ``Besides, I got a good
one this year and last year, too.''

   Stanford University students gave a
``B-minus'' Wednesday to the first computerized election in
California, but state officials graded it ``incomplete'' for a
general election.
   A few hardware problems _ laser printers that sometimes ``forgot
all their fonts'' and couldn't record coded versions of the ballots
_ caused some long lines when some polling places shut down briefly.
   But no hackers appeared to break into the system, as student
election officials feared.
   ``We were anticipating a lot of cracker jacks trying to get into
it, but we haven't noticed anything,'' said student elections
commissioner Steve Krauss.
   The estimated turnout of more than 6,000 voters over two days
easily surpassed the 3,159 voters at a similar election last week
at Boston University. The Stanford vote thus became the nation's
largest test yet of whether computer terminals can replace paper
ballots.
   ``It was very simple to use and much easier than pressing the
pins in the little holes on punchcard ballots,'' said sophomore
Tammy Svoboda, a member of Stanford's women's basketball team.
   ``I think it would be good for general elections, especially for
the younger generation,'' she said. ``It might be a little bit
scary for the older generation who haven't used computers, but once
someone showed them they'd be all right.''
   Most students rated the system, which used Macintosh computers
made by Apple Computer Inc. and software developed by sophomore
Sandy Aronson, as very ``user friendly.''
   Votes for the nearly 100 candidates for student senate and
council of presidents were expected to be tallied within two hours
of the closing of the polls Wednesday night. Last year, it took
five days to get official results.
   In addition, this year's election cost about $3,000 less than
the $13,00 price tag a year ago.
   State officials, observing the vote as a possible forerunner of
general elections in the 21st century, came away impressed but not
yet convinced that the voting public is ready to pick its leaders
by computer ``mouse.''
   General elections would require a direct record of a person's
vote, not data on a hard disk that could possibly be altered or a
coded printout that might not reflect the voter's choice, said John
Mott-Smith, coordinator of voter outreach programs for the
California Secretary of State's office.
   Despite the problems, Krauss said he would give the computerized
system a B-minus. ``There's plenty of room for improvement. We're
not making any pretense about its ability to handle a general
election.''
   Paper ballots didn't vanish completely. They were still used for
voting by students at Stanford's three overseas campuses, for
absentee ballots and for those who simply refuse to use the
computers.

<TEXT>
   Some New Hampshire residents will have a
long weekend thanks to a state holiday born in 1681 out of fear
that its first governor was going to die. Monday is Fast Day.
   Until four years ago, the fourth Monday in April was observed
widely as a spring Thanksgiving, with all state offices closed. But
the state's contract with its workers now has made Fast Day a
``floating holiday,'' an optional day off that allows state offices
to stay open.
   Although state offices will be open, some city and town offices
will close, schools and banks will close, federal offices will be
open and stores will have sales.
   Fast Day began with John Cutt, about whom little is known other
than he was ``President of the Royal Province of New Hampshire by
grace of Charles II,'' and that he sometimes spelled his name Cutts.
   Cutt was the richest merchant in Portsmouth, the colonial
capital. On May 6, 1680, when he was 60, he had a foreboding of his
death and wrote his will. By next year, the Welsh immigrant was so
ill that the colonial General Assembly declared a day of ``fasting,
humiliation and prayer'' for his recovery.
   It was a peculiarly New England custom to declare days of
fasting and prayer whenever the colonists felt threatened by
catastrophe.
   The first known fast day was observed by Massachusetts after the
drought of 1622. In 1894, Massachusetts substituted Fast Day with
Patriots Day to observe the start of the Revolutionary War.
Massachusetts and Maine observe Patriots Day on the third Monday in
April.
   New Hampshire's theological cure for Cutt failed. He died on
April 1, 1681.
   New Hampshire used to observe as many as three Fast Days a year.
By 1899, the Legislature decided on one and in 1949, with a view
toward a three-day weekend, the Legislature settled on the fourth
Monday in April.
   The nature of the observance has changed. Church attendance used
to be mandatory.
   The 10-shilling fine against those taking part in ``labour,
business or work of their ordinary calling'' was lifted long ago.
Recreation no longer is forbidden.
   Now the holiday comes as New Hampshire's long winter gives way
to spring, when snow tires and storm windows are packed away in
garages, when schools begin a week of vacation, and when golf
courses become snow-free.

<TEXT>
   El Salvador's attorney general
was killed Wednesday by a bomb that his driver said was placed on
top of his car at an intersection. The rightist president-elect
blamed leftist guerrillas.
   Roberto Garcia Alvarado, 53, was killed instantly by the blast,
said Oscar Orellana, the driver. The explosion ripped a hole
through the roof of the attorney general's Jeep Cherokee.
   Garcia is the highest-ranking government official slain since
the civil war began in 1981. An estimated 70,000 Salvadorans, most
of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict.
   Neither the driver nor a bodyguard in the jeep was visibly
wounded, but both complained of partial deafness from the blast.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. President-elect
Alfredo Cristiani blamed leftist guerrillas battling the
U.S.-backed government.
   In Washington, the State Department called the assassination a
``brutal, despicable killing'' and said the act was designed to
provoke further violence. ``We condemn this terrorism,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front last month
accused the attorney general's office of ``covering up for
murderers.'' Garcia was a militant of Cristiani's rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   El Salvador's attorney general, the government's chief
prosecutor, is not a Cabinet official and is appointed by Congress,
which is controlled by Arena. Garcia had held the post since
December.
   Orellana told journalists the jeep stopped at a downtown San
Salvador traffic light at 7:45 a.m. when a young man placed
something on the roof. The driver said he immediately tried to
accelerate, but the bomb exploded.
   Cristiani, who was having breakfast with foreign correspondents
when the attack occurred, condemned what he termed ``the brutal
assassination by Marxist guerrillas.''
   He said, ``This kind of act goes to show they (the rebels) are
not looking for peace, but rather trying to provoke a vengeful
response by security forces.''
   Cristiani said the guerrillas hoped to prompt an increase in
abuse of human rights by security forces that guerrilla
sympathizers could use to isolate his government.
   El Salvador depends heavily on U.S. economic and military aid.
U.S. officials have said continued aid will depend on the new
government's human rights record.
   The guerrillas, in a March 17 broadcast on their clandestine
Radio Venceremos, accused the attorney general's office of
``covering up for murderers.''
   The broadcast did not refer to any specific incidents and
contained no explicit threat against Garcia.
   Also Wednesday, President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is dying of
liver cancer, left El Salvador for a week's analysis and treatment
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.
   Duarte's health is deteriorating, but he is expected to be able
to personally hand over power to Cristiani on June 1. Cristiani was
elected on March 19.
   The armed forces and the rebels meanwhile announced that
government forces killed an Argentine doctor, identified as Gustavo
Islas Caceres, and a French nurse, Madelaine Languedoc, on Saturday
along with Salvadoran guerrillas.
   Rebel radio said the two foreigners and three rebels were killed
after being captured in an army attack on a rebel field hospital in
San Vicente province.
   An armed forces communique said the foreigners were armed
guerrilla fighters killed in combat along with seven Salvadoran
insurgents.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker told journalists the embassy
concluded the foreigners were killed in combat. Walker said no
field hospital existed at the battle site 30 miles east of San
Salvador.
   Walker said the two were medical workers with the guerrillas but
noted such personnel frequently double as combatants. The embassy
based its conclusions on armed forces information, he said.

   Israelis gathered for festive meals Wednesday
to begin Passover, the holiday commemorating the liberation of the
ancient Israelites from slavery. Security forces were on high alert
in case of guerrilla attacks.
   Thousands of people went to resorts on the Red Sea,
Mediterranean and Sea of Galilee. In Tel Aviv, secular Israelis
jammed beaches and outdoor restaurants.
   Army and police alerts were ordered because the 16-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories increased fear of
guerrilla attacks during the holiday.
   The army stepped up its forces to prevent infiltrations across
Israel's borders. Since January, 31 guerrillas have been killed in
a dozen attacks along the border with Lebanon.
   Police were out in force in Jerusalem's walled Old City to
prevent disruptions of religious services, a national police
spokesman said.
   In downtown Jerusalem, police discovered a small explosive
device in a paint bucket left on the sidewalk near a cafe, but
experts defused it, police spokesman Uzi Sandori reported.
   Passover, which commemorates the flight of the Israelites from
Egypt, began at sundown Wednesday with a traditional meal known as
the seder. It includes such symbolic foods as bitter herbs to
remind Jews of the harshness of their enslavement, and an
unleavened bread called matzoh.
   During the week-long holiday many Jews abstain from bread, beer
and other products made with yeast to remember the Israelites, who
left Egypt so quickly they had no time to leaven their bread.
   The holiday derives its name from the book of Exodus, which
recounts that God ``passed over'' the homes of Israelites when
meting out the worst of 10 plagues, and killed the first-born of
every Egyptian. The plagues forced the pharaoh to let the Jews
leave Egypt.
   In Tel Aviv, U.S. Ambassador William A. Brown participated in a
symbolic outdoor seder organized by Soviet Jewish activists to
thank the United States for supporting Soviet Jews who have been
refused permission to emigrate.
   Organizers set up a table on the sidewalk across the street from
the embassy, serving wine and traditional Passover dishes.
   The army served Passover meals at military bases, but soldiers
serving in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were given grape
juice instead of the traditional four cups of red wine, an army
spokesman said.
   In a goodwill gesture for the holiday, more than 700 prisoners
serving time for criminal offenses were given forloughs of two to
four days, said Shuli Meiri, a prison services spokeswoman.

<HEAD>Rules Proposed to Speed States in Child-Support Enforcement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed regulations Wednesday
designed to force states to pursue child support more vigorously by
requiring them to supply information for collection orders promptly.
   ``In the past, some states have not given sufficient attention''
to such efforts, said Health and Human Srvices Secretary Louis
Sullivan. ``Millions of children have suffered because of this lack
of attention.''
   Delay in action by the states, he said, has prevented children
from receiving financial support they are due.
   The regulations, which implement the Family Support Act passed
last year by Congress in a major welfare overhaul, sets time limits
for states to respond to requests for assistance in establishing
and enforcing child support orders.
   Limits would be established for opening and maintaining case
records, locating absent parents, establishing paternity, enforcing
support obligations and receiving and distributing support
payments. The regulations also provide criteria for states to use
in determining whether to close a child support case.
   States would be required to comply with those time limits by
Oct. 1, 1990.
   The regulations were published in Wednesday's Federal Register.
The Department of Health and Human Services set a 60-day comment
period, after which the department will issue final rules.

   Thousands of police rushed a crowd of 3,000
pro-democracy activists on Beijing's main boulevard early Thursday,
beating some protesters and taking away others.
   ``Fascists, dogs!'' members of the crowd yelled at police as
they ran to safety. ``Hoodlums and bandits!''
   Police by the thousands charged the crowd at 3:30 a.m., sending
protesters fleeing east past Tiananmen Square, the site of three
days of rallies calling for political reform and commemorating the
death of purged Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang.
   At one corner about eight police officers grabbed a woman in her
20s. One officer ripped off the sleeve of her coat. Other officers
slapped her face.
   Another protester on a bicycle also was hit. Three officers
knocked him to the ground and began kicking him. Chinese protesters
said they saw at least six other people being beaten.
   Some protesters threw bottles at police.
   There were no figures on arrests, but an Associated Press
reporter saw two people being put into a police jeep. Chinese
witnesses said they saw about eight people being taken away.
   About 200 police also rushed a crowd of several hundred
protesters in the western section of the city, kicking and beating
demonstrators who did not run quickly enough.
   Another group of about 150-200 students who had been blocking
the front of the Communist Party's headquarters at Zhongnanhai were
taken away in a bus. Its destination was not known.
   In Shanghai, about 1,000 students and workers marched Wednesday
to the central People's Square. One worker was arrested after
speaking to the crowd about ``the destruction of my life by the
Communist Party.''
   Police surrounded the square to keep onlookers away, and the
demonstration broke up about 7 p.m., foreign and Chinese sources
said.
   In both Beijing and Shanghai the demonstrations _ the largest
since nationwide student protests in the winter of 1986-87 _ were
triggered by Saturday's death of Hu at age 73.
   Hu, acclaimed by students for protecting the rights of
intellectuals, was forced to resign in January 1987 after being
blamed by conservatives for failing to take a harsh line against
the student demonstrations.
   The marchers in Beijing demanded freedom of speech and press and
more money for education. They also said that ``people who don't
understand science should not hold high office.''
   ``Down with dictatorship!'' the students chanted. ``Long live
freedom, long live democracy!''
   More than 15,000 people watched activists lead a rally Wednesday
evening from atop a monument to revolutionary heroes on Tiananmen
Square, the hallowed symbolic center of communist China.
   The monument was draped with dozens of wreaths and banners
eulogizing Hu and carrying slogans such as ``long live democracy
and freedom.''
   About 10:30 p.m., students led a march to Zhongnanhai, 300 yards
to the west of the square. About half the crowd gathered in front
of the red-walled compound, while thousands stood in the back with
their bicycles.
   About 6,000 participated, double the number of Tuesday night
when about 500 police finally dispersed the crowd with a show of
force.
   ``We don't need to go in, just let Li Peng come out!'' students
in the back shouted.
   Li, who became premier a year ago, is regarded as being cool
toward rapid economic and political reform. He said recently that
``excessive democracy'' is bad for China and stressed that the main
priority was social stability.
   As midnight neared, police succeeded in splitting most of the
crowd from Zhongnanhai, sending several hundred fleeing west, and
several thousand east.
   Students to the east of the compound staged a sit-in on Changan
Jie, the city's main boulevard.
   Initially, the atmpsphere was festive, with youths waving
two-fingered peace signs and offering soda to the phalanx of
officers blocking them from the party compound.
   At 3:20 a.m., after police loudspeakers urged the 3,000
remaining protesters to disperse. At least 2,000 officers locked
arms and ran into the crowd, forcing it to flee east along the
boulevard.
   Within 30 minutes, most of the protesters had disappeared.
   Just before 5 a.m., several hundred police adopted the same
tactic to the west, dispersing the several hundred students who had
gathered there.
   One student leader, Wang Dan of Beijing University, said the
students would hold actions every day through Saturday, when the
government will hold Hu's funeral in the Great Hall of the People.

   Attackers ambushed and shot up the first
truck convoy of a U.N. famine relief effort intended to save
100,000 lives in the southern Sudan war zone, killing seven armed
escorts, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
   They said a civilian driver and two assistants were wounded, and
radio reports from the scene identified the slain escorts as
members of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   U.N. officials in Nairobi did not affix blame for the attack on
the 14-truck convoy, but speculation centered on nomadic tribal
warriors, army soldiers or government-sponsored militias operating
against the rebels.
   The attack occurred Tuesday about 20 miles west of Kapoeta, a
rebel base in southeastern Sudan, 50 miles north of the Kenya
border. It was another setback for Operation Lifeline-Sudan, the
$132 million U.N. relief program plagued by delays caused by
bureaucracy, bad weather and equipment shortages.
   Relief officials said the trucks were carrying 100 tons of food,
medicine and other supplies to Torit, 100 miles west of Kapoeta,
when they were halted by rocket and automatic weapons fire.
   It was the first convoy to Torit under the U.N.-sponsored effort
to stockpile more than 100,000 tons of supplies in southern Sudan
before heavy rains beginning next month make transport virtually
impossible.
   Even before the attack, U.N. officials had conceded they
probably could not meet their goals before the rainy season, which
lasts until November.
   ``We think it is an isolated incident. We don't think it
represents a breach of agreement on the part of either party,''
said Diane Weathers, a U.N. World Food Program spokeswoman in
Nairobi.
   A statement issued in New York by James P. Grant, personal
representative of Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for the
project, said the United Nations ``would like to draw the world's
attention to the dangerous consequences that repetition of such
action could have on the future of Operation Lifeline-Sudan.''
   Operation Lifeline began April 1 after agreement in March by the
Sudanese government and rebels to allow relief supplies through
their lines for a month. Western relief organizations say up to
half a million people died in southern Sudan last year of
starvation caused by the 6-year-old civil war, drought and floods.
   Rebels led by former army Col. John Garang demand greater
autonomy and more economic help for the blacks of the south, most
of whom are Christians or animists, from the Arabs in the Moslem
north who control the government.
   A French monitor for the World Food Program was riding with the
convoy and reported the attack Tuesday night to officials
coordinating the relief operation from Nairobi.
   Paul Mitchell, a U.N. spokesman, said the lead vehicle was
destroyed by ``some sort of missile'' and the rebel escorts came
under fire from automatic weapons.
   He said the escorts were believed to be members of the Sudan
Relief and Rehabilitation Association, an agency of the rebel army.
Ms. Weathers said they were armed.
   Mitchell said use of Operation Lifeline's overland route to
Torit from Kapoeta would be suspended indefinitely but an airlift
to Torit from Entebbe, Uganda, would begin Friday.
   Operations officer Vincent O'Reilly said Torit's population had
grown from 3,000 to 25,000 as displaced southern Sudanese seeking
food and shelter arrived from the bush, and was expected to reach
50,000 in a few weeks.
   The United Nations had planned to move 25,000 tons of food and
supplies from Kenya to southern Sudan before the rains, but convoys
have taken only 120 tons to Kapoeta so far.
   Norwegian People's Aid, in conjunction with World Vision of
Monrovia, Calif., and the U.S. Agency for International
Development, has trucked several thousand tons of food to Kapoeta
since October in another relief effort.
   An airlift from Uganda operated by the World Food Program and
Catholic Relief Services has carried 3,000 tons of food and other
supplies to Juba, the southern provincial capital swollen by
refugees to a population of 300,000.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told
the Senate Wednesday that industry plans for responding to
catastrophes such as last month's Alaskan oil spill were ``zero''
and said federal and state officials should have required
improvements.
   Skinner also said he was ``disappointed'' in Exxon's response to
the 10-million gallon oil spill that occurred when a tanker
collided with a well-marked reef in Prince William Sound on March
24.
   Testifying before the same Senate subcommittee, a top Exxon
official acknowleged that industry plans for so massive a spill
were inadequate. But William Stevens, president of Exxon Company
USA, disputed any claim that his company's response had been slow.
   Yet, one Republican senator, John Chafee of Rhode Island,
ridiculed Exxon's early efforts to deal with the environmental
damage.
   ``From all accounts, the cleanup crews initially responding to
this spill acted more like the Keystone Kops than the well-trained
oil spill response team described in the industry's contingency
plan,'' he said.
   Most witnesses before the Senate's environmental protection
subcommittee _ from federal officials to Alaska's governor and
industry executives _ said that plans for dealing with a spill of
oil from the Alaskan pipeline had not imagined an accident on the
magnitude of the spill that followed the grounding of the Exxon
Valdez.
   Skinner, asked to evaluate the plan developed by a consortium of
oil companies that ship oil from Alaska's North slope through the
pipeline and Valdez harbor, said the document should not have been
approved by the state and should have brought warnings from the
federal government that the plan was inadequate.
   ``On the scale of one to 10, it was a zero,'' Skinner said of
the standby procedures.
   The secretary told the panel that, before the tanker ran
aground, everyone had ``assumed that this would never happen.''
   ``I don't think anybody was ready to deal with a spill of this
magnitude,'' said Skinner, whose department oversees the Coast
Guard.
   The subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
complained that ``there has never been a time when this situation
was under control.''
   He said the response to the spill has demonstrated ``a complete
breakdown'' of the procedures that were supposed to have been in
effect since the federal government approved the Alaskan pipeline
16 years ago.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper blamed complacency at all levels for
the poor preparedness, but also said that there had not been
adequate equipment on hand, that channels of authority were unclear
and that a lack of leadership and direction in the critical hours
after the spill further delayed cleanup efforts.
   He suggested that Alaskans had trusted the oil industry, which
accounts for 85 percent of the state government's revenue, to take
precautions. ``We feel like we've been assaulted,'' he told the
senators.
   Skinner said the Bush administration's decision to leave the
primary responsibility for the cleanup in Exxon's hands stemmed
from a belief that the company had committed itself to the cleanup
and ``had the technical expertise to deal with the problem.'' He
said he has been ``disappointed'' that the giant oil company has
not been able to assemble resources more effectively to better
protect the Alaska coastline.
   Exxon President Stevens said that before the March 24 accident,
such a severe accident was viewed as ``so highly unlikely that the
consequences of it ... were viewed as acceptable.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said that the effects of the spill
will last many years and that the price tag could exceed $1
billion. Suggesting that many Americans still cannot comprehend the
extent of damage, he said the area touched by contamination is the
size of three of the Great Lakes and that if the spill had occurred
in Portland, Maine, the oil today ``would be almost down to
Washington, D.C.''
   Some members of the committee complained about President Bush's
reaction, with Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine saying Bush
had been ``slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster.''
   Although the Coast Guard has been involved in the cleanup since
the start, Bush did not provide for stepped up federal
participation until April 7, two weeks after the spill, when he put
Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard commandant, in charge and committed
military assistance to the effort.
   Stevens, the Alaska senator, said he too had been disappointed
that the president did not act more quickly, telling the committee,
``If a sea fence had been deployed within a matter of hours, this
would have been a containable spill.''
   Bush himself has said he may have acted too slowly, telling the
American Society of Newspaper Editors last week that, as for the
commitment of federal assistance, ``maybe I should accept some
criticism on whether I should have done this a week before we did.
... If there's a lesson here that one agency or another might have
moved faster, I will be the first to learn from that.''

<HEAD>Georgia Clash Victims Suffer from Poison Resembling Nerve Toxin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said
Wednesday that some victims of a clash between soldiers and
protesters in Soviet Georgia are suffering from a poison resembling
a nerve toxin.
   Izvestia's interview with Georgia's health minister, Irakliy
Menagarishvili, appeared to bolster charges by activists in the
southern republic that soldiers used a toxic substance to break up
a nationalist demonstration April 9 on Tbilisi's main street.
   The clash killed 20 people.
   Izvestia did not say how many of the 140 people still
hospitalized after the confrontation were suffering from symptoms
of poisoning.
   The new Georgian Communist Party chief, Givi G. Gumbaridze, said
in an interview on Soviet television Wednesday that the situation
remained tense in Georgia despite lifting a curfew and withdrawing
soldiers.
   ``A wall of alienation remains,'' he said. ``It is necessary
that the people discover the truth.''
   Gumbaridze, the former KGB chief of Georgia, last week replaced
Dzhumber I. Patiashvili, who accepted responsibility for the
bloodshed and resigned.
   Menagarishvili told Izvestia leading toxicologists believed the
substance used on protesters had ``an irritating and atropine-like
effect.''
   He said scientists in Tbilisi, Moscow and Leningrad were
involved in diagnosing the cases.
   Atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid. In large doses it
can induce nerve paralysis and delirium. It can cause death through
combined cardiac and respiratory failure.
   Georgian activists claim that people died after being gassed,
but officials have not confirmed this.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Wednesday said Interior
Ministry officials acknowledged tear gas was used in two places to
break up protesters. But Pravda quoted the unidentified spokeman as
saying regular army soldiers could not have used gas because it is
not standard issue.
   ``Unfortunately, this crucial admission came several days late,
and was made only after the level of passions had reached the
highest degree,'' Pravda said.
   The Tass news agency said failure to promptly acknowledge what
was done ``led to fantastic rumors and allegations which made
people ... mistrust official reports.''
   When asked at a briefing Wednesday whether nerve gas was used in
Georgia, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh replied that
was impossible because it is a ``combat weapon.''
   Six newly elected deputies to a national parliament asked
Wednesday that better laws be developed to control troops and
public officials so demonstrations do not repeatedly end in tragedy.
   The six returned from a visit to Georgia and included their
findings in a letter to the weekly Moscow News.
   They demanded that material gathered by investigators be turned
over to the new Congress of People's Deputies parliament when it
meets for the first time next month.
   ``The absence of precise legal norms in the event of extreme
situations creates unlimited possibilities for the taking of
arbitrary, uncontrollable decisions, which can have unpredictable
consequences,'' their letter warned.
   They scolded officials for refusing journalists access to
Tbilisi and accused them of covering up the soldiers' use of
shovels as weapons and of gas.
   Foreign reporters have been barred from Georgia since the clash.
   Almost 5,000 civilian volunteers now patrol the streets of
Tbilisi and maintain order in place of departing troops, media
reports said.
   Reports from the Georgian capital said no serious incidents
followed lifting of the curfew there Tuesday morning.
   Tass said streets were patrolled by members of a public order
squad wearing red arm bands, and more police than usual were on the
streets.

   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the Gulf Coast
states Wednesday and rain fell in the Northwest, but most of the
rest of the nation had mild, sunny weather.
   A cold front extended from North Carolina to the middle of
Texas, separating cool, dry air to the north from warm and humid
air to the south.
   Along the front, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over
the South and were most widespread in southern Texas.
   Morning thunderstorms were heaviest on the west side of San
Antonio, Texas, where hail up to an inch in diameter was reported
and some roads were closed by high water, the National Weather
Service said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. CDT included
2.57 inches at Kelly Air Force Base at San Antonio, Texas.
   Wind gusted to 46 mph during a thunderstorm at Beeville, Texas,
the weather service said.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also occurred over northeastern
Mississippi, northwestern Alabama and along the Mississippi Gulf
Coast.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms developed during the
afternoon over the Florida Peninsula.
   In the Northwest, scattered afternoon showers developed from
western Montana to eastern Washington state.
   Elsewhere, the sky was clear from the Great Lakes across the
central Plains to the Southwest.
   Most of the western half of the nation had afternoon
temperatures in the 60s and 70s, up into the 90s in the desert
Southwest.
   Behind the cold front, temperatures were in the 40s and 50s from
the upper Mississippi Valley across the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes
to New England, and scattered frost was forecast overnight in
northern Kentucky.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 99 at Gila Bend, Ariz.
Wednesday's low in the 48 contiguous states was 19 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
along the Carolina coast, across southern Georgia and over much of
Florida, and over the upper Mississippi Valley. Rain was forecast
across the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 50s and 60s were predicted over the Great Lakes
region and New England, with some 40s in extreme northern sections;
in the 60s in the Appalachians and along the mid Atlantic Coast,
and along much of the Pacific Coast; in the 90s in southwestern
Texas and sections of New Mexico; around 100 in the desert
Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s across most of the rest of the
nation.

<HEAD>State To Pay For Premier's Libel Suit Against Time Magazine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state will pay for Premier Andreas
Papandreou's libel suit against Time magazine for publishing
accusations by a Greek fugitive banker that Papandreou received
millions of dollars in payoffs, a government spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said at his daily news briefing
that Papandreou sued the American newsmagazine ``as premier of
Greece ... so all expenses incurred by this suit will be paid by
the Greek state, which will be reimbursed from the damages received
from the positive outcome of the trial.''
   Kostopoulos confirmed that New York attorney Leonard Boudin
already has been paid $100,000 through the Greek Embassy in
Washington to handle the suit. He did not disclose how much money
Papandreou seeks in damages.
   Boudin said in New York Monday that the suit was brought against
Time in London because in Britain he need show only that the story
written about Papandreou was libelous and damaged his reputation,
without regard to whether he is a public figure.
   Time ran an interview with George Koskotas, former chairman of
the Bank of Crete, in its March 13 issue. Koskotas alleged that
Papandreou and senior members of his governing party, the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, received millions of
dollars in payoffs in return for political favors.
   Time officials said attempts were made to obtain Papandreou's
and the government's side of the story before it was published, but
they were rebuffed.
   Koskotas arrived in America days after he fled Greece in
November. He was arrested and jailed in Salem, Mass., where he has
granted interviews to the media. He awaits hearing on a Greek
petition for his extradition.
   The $200 million embezzlement scandal at the Bank of Crete has
been front page news in Greece since it broke last October.
   Eight ministers resigned and eight PASOK-appointed officials
from state enterprises were accused of accepting ``stolen money''
from the Bank of Crete and were imprisoned.
   Koskotas' bodyguards told investigators they personally
delivered cartons stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars to a
close friend of the premier's.
   At an earlier news briefing this month, spokesman Kostopoulos
branded Koskotas a ``swindler'' who had connections with
high-ranking American officials and alleged that they were behind
the scandal.
   He echoed Papandreou's repeated charges that foreign
decision-making centers initiated the campaign to undermine Greece
and smear the premier's name.

   On the day Ramon Salcido allegedly began a
deadly rampage through the California wine country, he called his
mother in Mexico and sobbed: ``Mama, this is the last time you will
hear my voice.''
   Valentina Bojorquez Armendariz could not recall exactly what her
oldest son said Friday, but remembered him saying ``I have problems
and I'm going to kill myself,'' or ``I have problems and they're
going to kill me.''
   Ms. Bojorquez, 49, was interviewed at home in Los Mochis,
Mexico, by the Los Angeles Times before Salcido's arrest Wednesday
by Mexican federal agents outside Guasave, a village in Sinaloa
state just north of his hometown.
   Salcido has been sought by California authorities since Friday's
discovery of the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, two young
sisters-in-law and a co-worker at the Sonoma County winery where he
was employed.
   Three of his little daughters were found with their throats
slashed the next day. Two were dead but one survived and has begun
to recover.
   Ms. Bojorquez said her son hung up and she had not heard from
him again, but she learned from news accounts that he was wanted
for the slayings.
   She said before his arrest that she believed it would be best
for him to give up.
   ``If he's not guilty, he should have nothing to fear. ... He
believed in his family,'' she said. ``He loved them and was very
proud of them. I don't believe that Ramon could have done this.''

   President Bush told a group of congressional
leaders Wednesday that he hasn't decision on future development of
the MX nuclear missile, the legislators said.
   ``He's indicated he's working on the MX issue and he's anxious
to receive the input from a wide variety of individuals on Capitol
Hill,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. ``He did not in any way strike
a note of finality.''
   Warner and other legislators said they didn't know whether Bush
would support building a mobile version of the MX, would back the
smaller Midgetman missile, or some combination of the two.
   Bush discussed the issue with House and Senate members of both
parties. He convened the group, along with his top foreign policy
advisers, in what he intends to use as an occasional chance to
consult with them on general foreign policy, his staff said.
   The missile question is part of an effort to build new weapons
for the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Bush's options
are to base new 10-warhead MX missiles on rail cars, a system
favored by Air Force generals, or develop a new single-warhead
missile known as the Midgetman, to be housed on trucks.
   The Midgetman is far more costly, with a price tag of nearly $24
billion for 500 single-warhead missiles, compared to $5.4 billion
for the same capability on the multi-warhead MX, according to Air
Force estimates.
   The United States currently has 50 MX missiles based in silos in
Wyoming and Nebraska, in addition to the multi-warhead Minuteman
missiles.
   The Soviets have deployed two mobile systems, the SS-25 with one
warhead and the SS-24, with 10 warheads.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said ``Those of us who think it's important to have a
Midgetman in the package got to make our case. If the president's
made his mind up, he didn't reveal it.''
   Aspin said he argued that the issue is ``critically important''
for achieving a strategic arms reduction treaty with the Soviets.
   The Bush administration is engaged in an overall review of
national security and foreign policy.
   Members of Congress who met with Bush didn't fault the White
House for that long process.
   `This is a new administration. It's a new Congress. I don't know
who came up with the idea that President Bush could just simply
move in and everything would be right on track and there would be
no review no slowdown,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``They're not taking
anything at face value or past value. I find that very comforting.''

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Wednesday eased
away from a commitment by the Bush administration to replace
expiring housing subsidy certificates with vouchers.
   While not announcing a policy reversal, Kemp told a House
subcommittee that the Department of Housing and Urban Development
was looking ``for some way to take the best characteristics of the
Section 8 certificate and the voucher and marry them.''
   ``I don't want to be the secretary of vouchers. I really,
strongly believe we need housing and economic development and
vouchers are a tool to give people a choice,'' said Kemp.
   Kemp's comments came in an apppearance before the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on HUD and independent agencies where
he presented the agency's 1990 budget request a day after the full
committee voted to add $153 million under the McKinney Homeless
Assistance Act to the agency's 1989 budget. department's 1990
budget request.
   Replacement of certificates with vouchers originated with former
President Reagan's 1990 budget proposal and was retained in the
revisions Bush submitted to Congress in February.
   About 1 million low-income households receive rental assistance
subsidies through the two programs.
   Subsidies in the HUD section 8 certificate are based on the
difference between 30 percent of a family's adjusted monthly income
and actual rent, which cannot exceed the fair market rent for the
area in which the family lives.
   Beginning in 1989, subsidies for 780,000 certificates will
expire over a 12-year period.
   A recent study by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, concluded that ``with HUD's 1989
budget request, about 9,500 or 6 percent fewer families can be
assisted with vouchers than with certificates.''
   The report also said it would cost an additional $208 million to
assist the same number of families with vouchers.
   ``They are ... more expensive than the certificate, but the
purpose was not to compete against the certificate. The purpose was
to give choice, ... give people a chance to upgrade,'' Kemp told
the panel.
   But he said he was open to looking at a mix of both as a part of
HUD's housing subsidy program.
   ``I'd also like to have somebody think of how we can take a
voucher or a certificate and have an element in there that would
give people some equity, some chance of maybe using it as a
potential for making a down payment someday,'' Kemp added.
   ``I commend Secretary Kemp for taking a fresh look at this
issue. The recent GAO report showed that the housing voucher
program hasn't lived up to expectations. I stand ready to work with
Secretary Kemp to develop a program that will provide
moderate-income pepole with the housing they need and at a price we
can afford,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairman of
Senate's HUD Appropriations subcommittee that had requested the GAO
study.

<HEAD>Senate Approves S&amp;L Bailout Bill, 91-8</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: To update, adds 4 grafs of administration reax after 3rd graf
previous ``The legislation''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved a record $157
billion bailout and reform bill for the savings and loan industry
after toughening provisions that would require S&amp;L owners to put
more of their own money at risk to stay in business.
   The 564-page bill was approved on a 91-8 vote two months after
President Bush called for emergency legislation to stop the
hemorrhaging of the federal S&amp;L insurance fund from the failure of
500 thrifts, more than 200 of them in 1988, and another 350 at or
near insolvency.
   The legislation reprsents the biggest government financial
rescue in history, dwarfing five times over the combined costs of
the New York City, Penn Central, Chrysler and Lockheed bailouts of
the 1970s and early 1980s.
   The administration praised the Senate's action, particularly
after it rejected an alternative financing scheme to put the
immediate $50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout on this year's
budget and create the potential for the biggest federal deficit in
the nation's history.
   ``The Senate deserves a great deal of credit for acting
swiftly,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. ``In fending off
amendments to the financing mechanism, the Senate has upheld the
integrity of the Gramm-Rudman (deficit reduction) process. We also
applaud the Senate's efforts to maintain strong capital
requirements.''
   The Bush plan avoids swelling the budget deficit by creating a
new quasi-government corporation to issue $50 billion in 30-year
bonds. The savings and loan industry will pay off the principle on
the bonds but tax dollars will be used to pay virtually all of the
$4 billion to $6 billion annual interest costs.
   Democrats had contended those interest costs could be reduced
$150 million a year or by a total of $4.5 billion over the 30-year
life of the bonds through direct borrowing by the Treasury.
   Similar S&amp;L legislation is moving through the House but at a
slower pace. Final congressional action is expected before July.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, had threatened to delay passage
and force the Senate to cut short its 11-day recess for Passover if
it did not adopt a tougher capital standard and mandate that banks
and S&amp;Ls provide a series of free and low-cost consumer services.
   After lengthy negotiations, members of the Senate Banking
Committee agreed to make S&amp;Ls have at least 1.5 percent so-called
``tangible'' capital in relation to their total loans that could be
seized in the future before federal insurance funds are tapped to
pay off depositors in failed thrifts.
   Bush's proposal would have required S&amp;Ls to double their
capital-loan ratio from the currently required 3 percent to 6
percent by 1991. But it would have allowed thrifts to meet the new
requirements entirely through the use of an accounting technique
that allows non-money ``good will'' as capital.
   The new 1.5 percent requirement for ``tangible'' capital _ cash,
stocks and property that could easily be converted to cash _ also
was adopted by the House Banking Committee's financial institutions
subcommittee last week.
   But the House panel weakened other capital requirements in
Bush's proposal, according to consumer group critics.
   The Senate Banking Committee's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle,
D-Mich., promised Metzenbaum speedy hearings and efforts to write
bills to address changes in banking laws sought largely by consumer
groups.
   Among them are measures that would require banks and S&amp;Ls to
cash all government checks, provide low-income people with low-cost
checking and publish data on their lending for improving low-income
neigborhoods and loans to minorities.
   ``It isn't all that I would like in the bill, but we've come to
an understanding,'' Metzenbaum said just before the vote.
   The bill tracks the proposal presented in February by Bush,
pledging $157 billion over the next 10 years _ two-thirds of it
from taxpayers _ to cover depositors against losses and calling for
widescale reforms.
   Chief among them was that S&amp;L owners be required to effectively
double their own investment to remain in business. Because many
operators of failed S&amp;Ls had little of their own money at risk,
they had little incentive to refrain from making risky loans using
federally insured deposits, according to Bush.
   The package includes money to pay for some $38 billion committed
last year to close or subsidize the mergers of more than 200 S&amp;Ls,
$50 billion to be spent over the next three years for rescuing 350
more institutions and $33 billion to handle new insolvencies
expected to arise before the year 2000.
   To fulfill Bush's promise of ``never again,'' the legislation
also effectively replaces the agency that oversees federally
insured thrift institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which has been widely criticized as being too close to the
industry, with a new regulatory authority to be established under
the Treasury Department.
   The S&amp;L deposit insurance program would be transferred to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which now guarantees bank
deposits. Both programs guarantee depositors against losses up to
$100,000 each.
   And the legislation establishes a new agency, the Resolution
Trust Corp., to dispose of some $400 billion in real estate and
other property that is falling into the government's hands through
defaults on bad loans made by failed S&amp;Ls.
   The package also increases from $10,000 a day to $1 million a
day the possible fines for S&amp;L operators convicted of fraud, which
has been cited by government auditors as the single biggest
contributor to the crisis, and provides $50 million to the Justice
Department to pursue criminal charges.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Senate rejected on a 61-38 vote an effort
aimed at the bank board's chairman, M. Danny Wall, who has been
widely criticized as minimizing the escalation of S&amp;L problems last
year.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., complained that Wall's reassuring
comments, as late as one month before the presidential election in
November, amounted to ``an intravenous shot of morphine that would
have numbed anyone to the crisis.''
   Wall was an aide to Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the banking
committee's ranking Republican and former chairman, for 17 years
before assuming the top S&amp;L regulatory post in July 1987.
   The administration and Garn want to guarantee Wall the right to
serve out his term through June 1991. Graham would have required
Bush to reappoint him, forcing a likely confirmation fight with the
Senate.
   On passage of the bill by the Senate, all the no votes were cast
by Democrats: Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, James Exon of Nebraska, Ernest
F. Hollings of South Carolina, Robert Kerrey of Nebraska,
Metzenbaum, and David Pryor of Arkansas. Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn., did not vote.

<TEXT>
   Under the bright lights of a tent often
used for basketball games in this seaside town, about 1,700 Jewish
emigres celebrated their first Passover outside the Soviet Union.
   For many who could not learn the rudiments of their faith in
their officially atheist homeland, the ceremony Wednesday was the
first real experience the holiday commemorating the release of the
ancient Israelites from bondage in Egypt.
   The emigres, who await visas for the United States or other
countries, were guided through the service by Rabbi Hirsch Rabiski,
who emigrated from the Soviet Union 15 years ago and now ministers
to the estimated 4,000 Jews in Ladispoli.
   He carefully explained in Russian the significance of the
Passover meal, the seder, and introduced the rituals. The refugees,
at small tables with their families, listened politely and some
whispered questions to neighbors.
   ``This is all so difficult to take in,'' said a doctor from Baky
in Azerbaijan province who identified herself only as Yana. She
said she felt overwhelmed by so much knowledge about a faith she
had always identified with but had not learned well.
   The seder was paid for and organized by the American Jewish
Joint Distribution Committee, which cares for the emigres from
arrival in Austria through the transfer to Italy, the main U.S.
visa processing point, to their departure weeks or months later.
   It gives them money, provides information about life in the West
and teaches the customs and history of the Jews.
   Many of the emigres living in holiday accommodations at
Ladispoli, a seaside resort 25 miles from Rome.
   Rabiski said Wednesday night the Passover at Ladispoli was
particularly poignant because those who attended were in flight
like the Israelites from Egypt.
   Gail Cohen, a representative of the Joint Distribution
Committee, said many of the emigres had attended lectures about the
ceremony and helped set up tables in the tent, which often is used
for basketball games.

   A retired librarian convicted of shooting
six people to death and trying to kill 24 others in a 1987 shopping
center rampage deserves the death penalty, a jury recommended
Wednesday.
   William Cruse, 61, sat hunched over the defense table and showed
no emotion as the recommendation was read to Circuit Judge John
Antoon after 1{ hours of deliberations.
   Antoon, who is not bound by the recommendation but said he would
give it great weight, set sentencing for July 28.
   The jury, which could have recommended a life prison sentence
instead of death, convicted Cruse on April 5 of 32 counts of
murder, attempted murder and kidnapping.
   The rampage occurred on April 23, 1987 at two shopping centers
in Palm Bay 30 miles south of Cape Canaveral on Florida's east
coast. The dead included two policemen.
   ``Cruse declared war on the community of Palm Bay,'' State
Attorney Norm Wolfinger said after Wednesday's decision. ``The jury
verdicts were very appropriate.''
   Jury foreman Wayne Hogan said a videotape of Cruse's police
interrogation strongly influenced the 12-member panel's decision.
Juror Edward Cook said, ``We all felt the same. He knew what he was
doing.''
   Defense attorneys refused to comment. They had contended Cruse
was insane at the time of the slayings.
   In closing arguments earlier Wednesday, State Attorney Norm
Wolfinger ridiculed the insanity defense.
   ``Evidence has shown that this defendant has forfeited his right
to live on Earth,'' the prosecutor said. ``He is a cold,
calculating killer. He deserves to die.''
   Wolfinger held up a shotgun and a semiautomatic assault rifle
used in the rampage. He pumped the shotgun several times and popped
an ammunition clip into the rifle repeatedly.
   ``He was going to kill as many people ... as he could,'' he said.
   Despite evidence of mental illness, Cruse showed he was in total
control of his faculties when he methodially tracked down his
victims and shot at them repeatedly, some as they lay wounded and
moaning on the ground, Wolfinger said.
   Assistant Public Defender Paul Arlt argued that the rampage
would never have happened if Cruse had not been suffering from
mental or emotional disturbance.
   ``Mr. Cruse that day was a bubbling cauldron'' that finally
exploded, Arlt said in his closing argument.

   Well-wishers flooded a hospital with stuffed
animals and other gifts Wednesday for a 5-year-old girl who lost
her hand when a pipe bomb concealed in a toothpaste dispenser
exploded at a K mart.
   Erin Bower lost her left hand and may recover only partial sight
in her left eye, Methodist Hospital physicians said.
   Erin, who was shopping with her parents at the K mart Monday
night, was holding the pump-type toothpaste dispenser when it blew
up.
   Her condition was upgraded Wednesday from serious to fair, and
she was moved from the pediatric intensive care unit to a
children's room, hospital spokesman David Richards said.
   ``That's really good news,'' Richards said. ``She's taken some
7-Up and apple juice and her mood is quiet.''
   ``She's in a lot of pain, so I'm not sure how much hassunk in at
this point,'' said hospital social worker Lynn Young. ``A lot of
the questions (about the explosion) haven't come yet.''
   The hospital has received a flood of balloons, plants and
stuffed animals and hundreds of calls expressing sympathy for Erin
and her parents, who have another daughter.
   ``The first thing they say is, `This was so horrible, I just
wanted to let the parents know I'm praying for them,''' said Mrs.
Young. The bombing makes people feel ``so vulnerable, like this
could happen to anybody,'' she said. ``A nice family goes to K mart
and their life changes forever.''
   A trust fund for paying Erin's medical expenses was set up at
the First National Bank branch where her 31-year-old mother,
Maureen, is manager.
   ``People are dropping off checks and cash,'' said bank Assistant
Manager Judy Bandy. ``Everyone is concerned for the well-being of
Erin.''
   Mrs. Bowers was slightly injured by shrapnel from the bomb. No
one else was hurt.
   Investigators have received more than 200 phone calls from
people who think they can identify two men wanted for questioning
who are depicted in composite sketches circulated by the Marion
County sheriff's department.
   The men, both believed to be about 20 years old, drew police
attention because they were seen nonchalantly leaving the store
immediately after the explosion as other people reacted to the
blast.
   Authorities have been contacted by former Indianapolis residents
from as far away as Alaska, Canada and Florida, said detective Sgt.
Mike Kouns of the sheriff's department.
   ``I've got more information than I know what to do with,'' Kouns
said.
   Police and two agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms spent Wednesday cross-checking names reported
by callers.
   Kouns said the bombing could have stemmed from a vendetta
against a K mart employee or the store itself, or may have been a
random attack.
   K mart offered up to $5,000 for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of those responsible, but sheriff's
department spokesman Scott Minier said store officials would be
urged to raise the reward to at least $10,000 ``because of the
senselessness of the crime.''
   Several Indianapolis radio stations urged listeners to
contribute to reward funds. K mart spokeswoman Leslie Kota at the
chain's Troy, Mich., headquarters, said company officials had not
discussed raising the reward.

   The USS Iowa was steaming for
Puerto Rico hours after a gun turret explosion and fire Wednesday
that killed 47 sailors, trailed by the Coral Sea, an aircraft
carrier with full medical facilities.
   No damage could be seen from a chartered jet.
   Svend Ovesen, the pilot, said the Navy had told aircraft to stay
25 miles from the Iowa, but we moved in close for a better view.
Our plane approached at 500 mph, then Ovesen lowered the landing
gear and circled the battleship at 130 mph.
   Two jets took off from the USS Coral Sea, but there was no
effort to interfere with us.
   The explosion in one of the Iowa's three turrets occurred during
a gunnery exercise 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico, the Navy
said.
   By 4 p.m. EST, the 887-foot vessel was 205 miles north of Puerto
Rico, heading south toward the island's Roosevelt Roads naval base.
Whitecaps dotted the calm blue of the Caribbean.
   Three other Navy ships besides the Coral Sea could be seen in
the area.
   At an altitude of 500 feet and an equal distance from the Iowa,
no signs of exterior damage could be seen and no one appeared to be
on deck.
   In two forward turrets, the guns pointed off to the right, but
the three 16-inch guns of the rear turret were pointed straight
astern.
   ``Those turrets normally should be pointing straight when
they're not being fired,'' said George Tomlinson of Bholke Int.
Airways, owner of the plane, who accompanied the reporter and Tito
Guzman, a photographer for the daily El Nuevo Dia.
   ``Their being in all different directions like that, off to one
side, means something's wrong,'' said Tomlinson, a former Marine.
   Navy officials said the explosion occurred in the second of the
two forward turrets, which normally is manned by 27 sailors but can
hold 60 or 70. A huge U.S. flag is painted on the top surface of
the turret.

   Daphne du Maurier, author of ``Rebecca,'' died
Wednesday at her home in Cornwall, the wildly beautiful English
province in which she set many of her celebrated novels of romance
and the supernatural. She was 81.
   Her novels like ``Rebecca,'' ``Frenchman's Creek,'' ``My Cousin
Rachel,'' and ``Jamaica Inn'' were household names in popular
fiction and became hit movies.
   The du Maurier style, vivid and gothic, made for spine-chilling
films like Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds,'' from her short story,
and Nicolas Roeg's ``Don't Look Now,'' from her novella.
   Dame Daphne, as she was known after being honored by Queen
Elizabeth II, died in her sleep, said her friend and legal
executor, Monty Baker-Munton.
   Until about two weeks ago, she had been fit enough for daily
walks with her dog around Par, the Cornish village where she had
lived in widowed seclusion for 20 years.
   Daphne du Maurier was born in London on May 13, 1907, one of
three daughters of the renowned actor Sir Gerald du Maurier.
   Educated by private tutors in Paris, she was 21 when she
published her first articles and short stories. Her first novel,
``The Loving Spirit,'' appeared in 1931.
   The novel captivated a young British army major and led to a
storybook courtship.
   The officer, Frederick A. M. ``Boy'' Browning, resolved to meet
the young woman and journeyed to Par to find her. They met in 1932
and married a few months later.
   ``It was rather woman's magazine-y,'' she remarked afterward.
   In the same year she published her second novel, ``I'll Never be
Young Again.'' ``Jamaica Inn,'' a big seller, followed in 1936, and
then came ``Rebecca.''
   ``Rebecca,'' about a young bride whose probing into the death of
her husband's previous wife leads her into a frightening
psychological labyrinth, was published in 1938 and sold 1 million
copies in hard cover alone. It was reprinted 39 times, launched
Laurence Olivier's movie career opposite Joan Fontaine, and was
translated worldwide.
   She became Lady Browning with the ennoblement of her husband,
who had been commander of British Airborne Forces in World War II
and then treasurer to Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II.
   In 1943, they rented Menabilly, the rambling, often fog-shrouded
Georgian manor which had inspired Manderley, the fire-doomed
mansion in ``Rebecca.''
   Oliver Cromwell's troops gutted the house during the English
Civil War, and legend had it that a cavalier was bricked up alive
in one of Menabilly's gray stone buttresses.
   The writer's hideaway was a gardener's hut, where, she said,
``I'd sit for hours on end, chain-smoking, chewing mints and
tapping away at my typewriter.''
   She would prowl the grounds of Menabilly or answer stacks of fan
mail when not at work on her writing.
   Her husband died in 1965. In 1969, Dame Daphne, as she had
become that year, moved from Menabilly to Par with her two
Yorkshire terriers and rented another mansion, Kilmarth. ``It is
rather like death to have to leave,'' she said. Despite her wealth,
she never owned a home.
   At Kilmarth she wrote ``The House on the Strand.'' Her last
novel was ``Rule Britannia,'' published in 1972. ``Growing Pains,''
a memoir of her early years, appeared in 1981, and her introduction
to a new book on Cornwall will appear in the fall.
   Although always cheerful and kind to friends, she preferred a
secluded life. ``I can't say I really like people,'' she once
remarked. ``Perhaps that's why I always preferred to create my own
instead of mixing with real ones.''
   She waited until age 64 before consenting to be interviewed on
TV.
   Baker-Munton said she would be cremated later this week at a
private ceremony with no flowers and only family friends, her son
and two daughters, in accordance with her wishes.

<HEAD>Rangoon Says 600 Karens Killed in Battle for Major Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers toppled a major Karen rebel
stronghold and killed more than 600 of the insurgents during a
two-month government offensive near the Thai border, a government
spokesman said Wednesday.
   In Rangoon, a grenade exploded Wednesday outside the home of an
opposition leader, injuring two teen-agers, witnesses said.
   At a news conference, Col. Than Tun said 177 government
soldiers, including some officers, were killed and 377 were wounded
in the battle for the Maela camp.
   The bodies of 466 guerrillas were counted but he said more than
600 were killed during the offensive.
   Maela, near the Thai border, was regarded as one of the two
major Karen strongholds. The other, Maw Poh Kay, fell to government
forces March 26.
   The colonel claimed the government victory broke the backbone of
the Karen insurgency, which began in 1949, a year after Burma
achieved independence from Britain.
   Thai police officers and Karens who fled the base also reported
its seizure but gave much lower casualty figures.
   The Karens said Wednesday about 40 camp defenders were killed,
including 10 students who joined the rebels after fleeing last
year's government crackdown on the student-led protests for
democracy.
   They said 180 to 200 government troops were killed.
   The base is 135 miles northeast of the capital, Rangoon.
   Than Tun said government forces fought 66 major engagements with
the rebels since operations against Maela began Feb. 18. The
Karens, an ethnic minority, charged the government has reneged on
promises of greater regional autonomy.
   The Karens are allied with nine other guerrilla groups in the
National Democratic Front, which claims to field 35,000 fighters
and control half the country.
   In Rangoon, a hand grenade exploded 20 yards from the house of
opposition leader Aung Gyi, witnesses said. They said it injured
two 16-year-old boys who found the grenade while playing in front
of the house.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
explosion damaged the walls of a nearby house. Aung Gyi was not at
home at the time.
   Aung Gyi was one of the original leaders of the leading
opposition party, The National League For Democracy. But he was
removed from the party when he asked another leader, Aung San Suu
Kyi, to expel communists from her faction.
   Aung Gyi later formed his own party to contest an election that
military authorities have promised to hold next year.

<HEAD>Gypsy Monarch Baron Demeter Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MULHOUSE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dominitchi Demeter, considered a king
among Gypsies, died at a hospital where hundreds of his followers
flocked upon hearing of his illness, police and hospital officials
said.
   Demeter, 57, was admitted last week to the Mulhouse Hospital
Center, suffering from cerebral congestion. He was in a coma when
he died Tuesday night, a hospital spokesman said.
   About 700 Romany Gypsies of Hungarian origin had gathered in the
Mulhouse region in eastern France when they heard that the Gypsy
leader, known as Baron Demeter, was ill. More than 100 caravans
were parked Wednesday at an unused mine in nearby Wittenheim.
   The hospital spokesman said hundreds of Gypsies filed through
the hospital over the last few days to pay respects to Demeter. A
special telephone line was installed to take care of phone calls by
followers in France and abroad inquiring about his condition, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   ``Baron Demeter had a considerable audience among the Gypsy
diaspora,'' said a police official, also speaking anonymously.
``The entire community, from all continents, was following the
agony of the patriarch.''
   A police spokesman said Demeter's body would be transported
Thursday to the Paris region, accompanied, in the Gypsy tradition,
by an all-male escort. The body was to be buried on Friday, but the
exact burial site was not immediately known.

<HEAD>Paper Prints Picture Of U.S. House Speaker And Woman in Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British tabloid, serializing the sex and scandal
memoirs of a former call girl who later worked as a government
researcher, printed a picture of her with U.S. House Speaker Jim
Wright in Thursday's editions.
   Early editions of the Daily Mail said the picture of Pamella
Bordes and the Texas Democrat, now under investigation for alleged
unethical conduct, was taken during a 1983 meeting in Wright's
office on Capitol Hill.
   The London tabloid, which bought the rights to Ms. Bordes'
story, said at that time she was working for the Indian mystic and
businessman Chandra Swami. The meeting was arranged by the Swami,
who had business connections in Washington, the paper reported.
   ``Among the things discussed, according to those close to the
Swami, was the possibility of obtaining a `green card' permit for
Pamella officially to become an American resident,'' the newspaper
said.
   ``Unknown to Jim Wright, this was at a time when she was, in her
own words, working as `sex bait' for the Swami's international
business deals. At the meeting, the Swami presented Mr. Wright with
some ceremonial gifts and pleaded with him to help Pamella.
   ``His (Wright's) staff sent a copy of this picture to Pamella
signed with his best wishes.''
   The newspaper said a spokesman for Wright said the office
remembered the meeting with Swami's group but ``did not recall
doing anything to help her obtain a green card.''
   Wright has denied charges by the House Ethics Committee that he
violated House rules in 69 instances involving an unusual book
publishing deal and his benefits from a business partnership.
   The first installment of Ms. Bordes' memoirs printed in
Wednesday's Daily Mail contained lurid tales of sex with financier
Adnan Khashoggi, with a Saudi prince and with a top aide to Libya's
Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   The Daily Mail quoted her as saying she was introduced to life
as a jet-set call girl by Khashoggi, the Saudi billionaire arms
dealer, whom she met in Paris in 1983.
   The Mail said it was sending all its material on Miss Bordes and
Khashoggi to the FBI.
   Khashoggi was arrested Tuesday in Switzerland on a U.S.
extradition request connected with allegations he helped hide
assets belonging to deposed President Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines and his wife, Imelda.
   In its story, the Daily Mail quoted her as saying her bedmates
included Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia, with whom Khashoggi was
brokering an arms deal. The newspaper did not identify the prince
further except to say he was a senior member of the ruling family.
   The newspaper reported that she was flown to Tripoli, Libya in
1984 in the private jet of Ahmed Gadaff Al Diam, whom the Mail
identified as a cousin of the Libyan leader, second-in-command of
Libyan intelligence, and Libya's top arms buyer in Europe. She was
quoted as saying she had sex with Al Diam in Tripoli.
   Miss Bordes, 26, who was Miss India in 1982, was quoted as
saying she got money from Al Diam and stayed in touch with him
until shortly before she got a job last year as a researcher in the
British Parliament.
   It was that job that led to the British press's discovery of her
background and raised questions about whether national security was
compromised by allowing free movement in the House of Commons to a
woman with high-level Libyan connections.
   Miss Bordes fled to the island of Bali, was tracked down by
British reporters and offered her story to the highest bidder.

   A huge gun turret packed with gunpowder
exploded in flames on the battleship USS Iowa near Puerto Rico on
Wednesday, killing at least 47 sailors in one of the worst naval
disasters since the Vietnam War.
   The death toll from the accident during a gunnery exercise,
``could go higher, but we don't know at this point,'' said Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet, based in
Norfolk. The death count was taken from a list of sailors assigned
to the position rather than a body count.
   The number of crewmen injured had not been determined, he said.
   Two ships participating in the same exercise collided Wednesday
afternoon about 500 miles east of Jacksonville, Fla., causing one
minor injury, said Archie Galloway, a civilian public affairs
officer at Norfolk.
   Neither the USS Platt, a fleet oiler, nor the frigate USS Tripp
was in danger of sinking, Galloway said. The ships were not in the
same area as the Iowa.
   The explosion occurred in one of the Iowa's three heavily
armored turrets, each of which supports three of the ship's nine
16-inch guns. The turret was ``full of gunpowder,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Chris Baumann, another fleet spokesman.
   Iowa crewmen put out the fire in 80 minutes, flooded several
magazine compartments holding explosives as a precaution and
declared the ship out of danger, Baumann said.
   The Iowa rendezvoused at midafternoon with the nearby aircraft
carrier USS Coral Sea, which carries three doctors and has full
medical facilities, Baumann said. Helicopters from the Coral Sea
brought medical equipment to the Iowa and transferred some injured
crewmen to the carrier.
   ``The ship has not sent a list of the wounded. They have other
things more pressing to worry about,'' said Lt. Russ Grier, an
Atlantic Fleet spokesman.
   The Iowa will arrive Thursday at Roosevelt Roads, a Navy base in
Puerto Rico, said Cmdr. Robert Franzmann of the Atlantic Fleet. The
46-year-old ship, one of the four largest in the fleet, is based at
Norfolk.
   Burn victims from the Iowa were being evacuated to Brooke Army
Medical Center specialized burn unit in San Antonio, Texas,
according to medical official in Puerto Rico.
   Navy officials were notifying relatives personally of the
deaths, Baumann said. Several family members gathered at a
gymnasium in Norfolk to await word.
   ``The longer we hear nothing, the better it is,'' said Sandy
Tate of Charleston, W.Va., a relative of crewman Jonathan Tate.
   The explosion occurred during a gunnery exercise about 330 miles
northeast of Puerto Rico, Burnett said. The ship's 16-inch guns can
fire 2,700-pound shells a distance of 23 miles.
   The fire was in the second of the two forward turrets, at the
loading position of the middle gun, said Bruce Nason, a Navy
spokesman at the Pentagon. There also is a turret at the back of
the Iowa. Each turret is protected by armor that is 17{ inches
thick.
   There was no sign of the accident visible during a flyover of
the ship.
   A gun turret is normally occupied by 27 people, but can hold 60
or 70 people, Baumann said, but, ``We don't know how many people
were in there at the time.''
   Mark Newton, a former Marine who spent a week as a guest on the
Iowa in 1987 and now is curator of the permanently docked USS
Massachusetts in Fall River, Mass., explained how a shell is loaded.
   After the shell is placed in the gun, a door is opened to the
gun room from the powder hoist room, he said. Cylindrical powder
bags, containing about 110 pounds of powder, are then rammed in
behind the shell and what is called a breech plug is sealed to
prevent the leakage of powder gases.
   Newton said there were ``at least five'' stages in the firing
process when the explosion could have occurred but would not
speculate further.
   The training exercise to improve fleet readiness began April 13
and involved 19,000 people aboard 29 U.S. ships, three allied ships
and shore-based aircraft, Baumann said.
   There were 1,600 people aboard the Iowa, including Vice Adm.
Jeremiah Johnson, commander of U.S. 2nd Fleet.
   It was believed to be the worst loss of life involving a Navy
ship since June 2, 1969, when the destroyer USS Frank E. Evans
collided with the Australian aircraft carrier Melbourne in the
South China Sea, killing 74 people. An Iraqi missile attack on the
USS Stark in May 1987 killed 37 crewmen and wounded 21.
   A similar explosion occurred in the center gun turret aboard the
heavy cruiser USS Newport News during the Vietnam War in October
1972, killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36.
   ``It is a great tragedy and a matter of terrible sadness,''
President Bush said in Washington. ``I will take this opportunity
to express my regrets, especially to the families of the kids that
were killed.''
   In addition to its massive 16-inch guns, the 887-foot Iowa is
equipped with 12 five-inch guns and Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles.
It was the model for three other Iowa-class battleships and is
among the most heavily armored of U.S. warships.
   The Iowa and its sister ships, the New Jersey, the Missouri and
the Wisconsin, are the largest battleships ever built except for
two Japanese ships of the World War II era, the Yamato and the
Musashi.
   The Navy, in accordance with policy, would not confirm or deny
whether the ship carried nuclear weapons.
   The Iowa was built during World War II, mothballed until the
Korean War, and mothballed again. It was modernized and reactivated
in 1984, at a cost of $409 million, and returned home last year
after service escorting Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf.
   The Navy provided the following hot line numbers for people to
call for information about relatives on the ship: inside Virginia:
800-572-2126; outside Virginia: 800-368-3202 or 800-523-2975.

<TEXT>
   Seven students were arrested Wednesday
after refusing to budge from a University of Massachusetts
laboratory where they were protesting against Defense
Department-funded research.
   Campus Director of Public Safety Arthur Hilson said the three
women and four men were removed, and in some cases dragged, from
the Marcus Hall laboratory, when they remained in the building
after closing hours. He did not release their names, but said they
were being booked on trespassing charges.
   The occupation, which started at 1 p.m., stemmed from a campus
rally earlier in the day against such projects as the university's
quest for an anthrax vaccine.
   The university maintains the research focuses on a non-virulent
strain and is for peaceful purposes, but students and members of
the local chapter of the American Friends Service Committee want
the research moved off campus.
   ``It's kind of a leap to say basic research on the university
campus is somehow directly supporting a war in El Salvador,'' said
university spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins. ``Our research here is all
basic. It's all non-classified.''
   Hilson said the students were repeatedly warned that they were
violating the student code of conduct by staying in the building
after hours. He said he consulted with school Chancellor Joseph
Duffey before ordering the arrests.

<HEAD>U.S. Citizens Must Now Have Special Visas To Travel To Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has told airlines and
travel agencies that beginning Friday all U.S. citizens must have
visas approved by the government to visit Panama.
   The Panamanian Institute of Tourism said in a statement that
each visa must be stamped by a Panamanian consul that recognizes
the government of acting president Manuel Solis Palma.
   The majority of Panamanian consulates do not recognize the Solis
Palma government, continuing to recognize the government of
President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was ousted in February 1988.
   Previously, U.S. citizens traveling to Panama needed a tourist
card, available at any Panamanian consulate.
   The institute, in a statement distributed to the tourist
industry, said U.S. citizens wishing to visit Panama on business
dealing with Panama Canal accords between the Panamanian and U.S.
governments must still have official permission from the Panamanian
government to enter and leave the country.
   The official permission must be sought by U.S. officials and
will remain valid as long as a U.S. citizen works with the Panaama
Canal Commission, the statement said.
   The U.S. and Panamanian governments have been at odds for more
than a year, ever since Panama's de facto leader, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, orchestrated the ouster of then-president Delvalle.
   Delvalle was ousted after he tried to fire Noriega, the Defense
Forces chief, following Noriega's indictment by a federal grand
jury in Florida on drug trafficking charges. Solis Palma was later
appointed acting president.
   The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Panama in an
attempt to force Noriega out and continues to recognize Delvalle
and reject Solis Palma as the country's legal president.

   Families of crew members aboard the USS Iowa
gathered Wednesday at a Norfolk Naval Station gym to await word
about loved ones who were on the ship when a gun turret packed with
gunpowder exploded in flames.
   ``The major problem is lack of information,'' said Navy Chaplain
Barry Brimhall, who was with the families. ``They are very, very
frustrated. For those who had husbands or sons in the area of the
explosion, they are wondering, `Was it my husband, my son?'''
   ``The longer we hear nothing, the better it is,'' said Sandy
Tate of Charleston, W.Va., a relative of crewman Jonathan Tate.
   Navy policy requires that families of dead or injured sailors be
notified before any list of victims is released to the news media,
and not all families had been notified by mid-evening Wednesday,
officials said.
   Brimhall was one of many Navy chaplains, social workers, and Red
Cross personnel called in to deal with the families' grief.
   ``The first thing we did was establish a place for them to
gather,'' said Master Chief Billy Kinder, an Atlantic Fleet
spokesman. ``We provide a place for them to be. The chaplains,
social workers, Red Cross and others are there to help them in any
way possible.''
   ``Our primary purpose,'' Brimhall said, ``is to help them air
their feelings, talk about their fears to reassure them, but be
honest. Some are going to loose a loved one. It is a ministry of
presence.''
   The families were helping each other, Brimhall said.
   ``There is a lot of support within the group. I saw
relationships develop right before my eyes as women put their arms
around those who were having touble,'' he said.
   He described the mood in the gym as varied.
   ``There are those who are really struggling and those who are
really stoic,'' he said.
   Ann Quagliotti of Brownton, W.Va., said she and her husband
hadn't been able to reach Navy officials to find out about her son,
Mark Quagliotti, a dentist on the Iowa.
   ``I have no idea where our son could be,'' Ms. Quagliotti said.
``Anything is possible.''
   The Navy's contingency plan for such tragedies was worked out
long before the accident, Kinder said.
   ``We take this very seriously. Family response crisis is a very
major issue with us,'' he said.
   Kinder said the families are given updates at least every half
hour, and more often as developments warrant.
   ``Right now, for some of these families, they would rather have
bad news than no news at all,'' Brimhall said.

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 Americans are hospitalized
annually with a split wall in the body's major artery, an ailment
that sent Lucille Ball into emergency heart surgery, a heart
specialist said Wednesday.
   ``It's one of the most severely painful diseases a human has to
suffer,'' although not everyone who gets an ``aortic dissection''
experiences extreme pain, said Dr. Thomas Robertson, chief of
cardiac diseases at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in
Bethesda, Md.
   The condition, also called a ``dissecting aortic aneurysm,''
involves a tear that splits the wall of the aorta, the main artery
connecting the heart to smaller arteries that carry blood
throughout the body.
   Although 2,000 Americans reach hospitals and are diagnosed with
a split aorta each year, an unknown number of others suffer the
ailment and have it misdiagnosed as a heart attack or die before
they arrive at an emergency room, Robertson said during a telephone
interview.
   He estimated aortic dissection kills about half of those it
afflicts, often when the split aorta wall ruptures to cause
internal hemorrhaging.
   Of those who reach hospitals and undergo surgery, about
three-fourths survive hospitalization. Death is most likely during
the operation itself, he added.
   The aorta emerges from the left ventricle _ the heart's main
pumping chamber _ passes upward and arches over the top of the
heart, then passes down behind the heart and into the abdomen.
   During aortic dissection, a tear suddenly develops in the tissue
that makes up the wall of the aorta. The layers of tissue separate,
allowing blood to flow into the gap, which then painfully expands
like a balloon. The pressure can make the tear spread up or down a
greater length of the artery.
   An aortic dissection is different than the much more common and
conventional aortic aneurysm, in which the artery wall is weakened
and balloons outward, but layers of the artery wall don't split.
   ``In Miss Ball's condition, the beginning portion of her aorta
(near the heart) began to tear apart, and that tearing progressed
all the way down into her abdomen,'' her surgeon, Dr. Robert Kass,
said Tuesday night.
   The split wall ``involved essentially her whole aorta,'' he
added.
   During the six-hour operation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
Kass said, he removed the 77-year-old Miss Ball's ascending aorta _
the short stretch of aorta that emerges from the ventricle _ and
the aortic valve. He replaced them with those taken from the
cadaver of a 27-year-old.
   The aortic valve controls the flow of blood from the ventricle
into the aorta. Kass said the expansion in Miss Ball's split artery
wall ``unroofed the aortic valve'' to make it leak. A leaky valve
can cause heart failure because blood can't be pumped out of the
heart efficiently.
   During a news conference, Kass didn't explain why the rest of
the aorta wasn't replaced.
   But Robertson said many arteries branch off the aorta, so it's
safest to replace only the part where the tear started.
   A surgeon can ``tack'' together the place where the split wall
continues, preventing ballooning by blocking blood from flowing
into the gap, he said.
   Kass also said he detached the ends of Miss Ball's coronary
arteries where they connected to her ascending aorta, then
reattached them to the newly implanted aorta, restoring blood flow
that nourishes the heart.
   Sometimes an aorta with a split wall isn't replaced, but is
repaired with synthetic materials, such as by inserting a knitted
Dacron tube inside the defective section of aorta.
   Doctors don't know why aortic walls sometimes split. Hardening
of the arteries and congenital artery weakness have been suspected.
But the risk is increased by high blood pressure, which Kass said
Miss Ball has suffered for several years.

   Police and U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents raided a remote ranch and seized 1,375 pounds
of refined cocaine, the largest ever seized in Bolivia, U.S.
Ambassador Robert Gelbard said Wednesday.
   The cocaine was found Monday at a ranch 330 miles to the
northeast of La Paz, near the town of San Ramon, said U.S. DEA
agents involved in the seizure. Authorities said one person was
apprehended during the raid, which was first disclosed Wednesday.
   ``This is far and away the largest single amount ever caught in
Bolivia,'' Gelbard said in an interview. He said the amount _ more
than double the cocaine seized in Bolivia all last year _ indicated
a capacity of producing refined cocaine much greater than
previously estimated by U.S. authorities.
   Bolivian police authorities believe the cocaine belonged to
Carmelo Rodriguez, considered to be one of Bolivia's biggest
cocaine traffickers.
   A relative of Rodriguez owned the ranch, officials said. The DEA
said a cocaine processing lab was found and destroyed at the same
ranch in August. They said it apparently was awaiting shipment to
Colombia.
   The cocaine was seized during an operation involving 20 Bolivia
narcotics police and DEA agents who flew to the jungle ranch on
four Huey helicopters donated by the U.S. government.
   Authorities said a ranch employee was being held for questioning
at a police base in Trinidad, about 250 miles northeast of La Paz.
They said the cocaine was being held by authorities under the
supervision of the attorney general's office, which is seeking a
court order to burn it.
   During all of 1988, authorities seized 546 pounds of refined
cocaine in Bolivia, U.S. officials said.

   A Soviet ship that can skim oil on the
high seas joined the war against the nation's worst oil spill
Wednesday, docking in a town named for the man who bought Alaska
from Russia for $7.2 million.
   The 11,400-ton Vaidogubsky, 425 feet long, steamed 30 miles up
fjord-like Resurrection Bay under a cloudy sky, flying the Soviet
hammer and sickle from its stern and an American flag from its
towering white superstructure.
   It tied up at a railroad dock, its decks strewn with heavy
equipment, smoke spewing from its stacks.
   About 100 yards away, crews unloaded oil-soaked booms and
absorbent material from the cleanup at Nuka Bay, one of the most
polluted sites on the southern coast of the Kenai Peninsula.
   ``It's pretty impressive for a skimmer,'' said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Ken Safford, who snapped photos as the ship arrived a
little before 8 a.m. ``It's huge.''
   By midmorning, a stream of tourists were driving up to the dock
to take pictures and wave to the crew.
   The ship came to Seward for refueling, and probably would be in
port all day, said Coast Guard Capt. Rene Roussel.
   The oil spilled March 24 by an Exxon tanker is becoming very
thick and difficult to deal with as it weathers, Roussel said.
   ``We don't know how it (the Vaidogubsky) is going to work in the
kind of oil we're skimming,'' he said. ``Our goal is to get in the
oil. We'll probably use it in Resurrection Bay for awhile.''
   The Vaidogubsky works with two motorboats that drag a boom to
corral the oil. Then two pipes working like 100-foot straws dip
into the oil and suck it onto the larger ship, said a Soviet
crewman who spoke in halting English.
   The vessel is capable of gulping 200,000 gallons per hour, and
has a storage capacity of 2 million gallons.
   If there's not enough oil there to justify its continued use,
the Coast Guard will move it ``to where the oil is. Nuka Bay is our
most likely plan,'' he said.
   The Vaidogubsky probably will be available for 30 days, Roussel
said. It's unclear who will pay its fuel and operating costs, he
said.
   Exxon has promised to pay the costs of the total cleanup effort.
   The Soviets have had an interest in Alaska's fisheries for more
than a decade, with U.S. fishing boats delivering cod and flounder
to Soviet processing ships.
   Though the joint venture is expected to phase out over the next
few years because of ``Americanization'' of the bottomfish catch,
the Soviets received 176,000 tons last year and are expected to
take less than 110,000 tons this year, said Bert Larkins, general
manager of Marine Resources Co. in Seattle, the Soviets' U.S.
partner in the joint venture.
   In Washington, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told the
Senate on Wednesday that industry plans for dealing with an Alaskan
oil spill had been a ``zero'' on a scale of one to 10, and one
senator said the initial response to the March 24 disaster reminded
him of ``the Keystone Kops.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the environmental
protection subcommittee, said the response to the spill has
demonstrated ``a complete breakdown'' of the procedures that were
supposed to have been in effect since the federal government
approved the Alaskan pipeline 16 years ago.
   William D. Stevens, president of Exxon Co. USA, denied that his
company has been slow in responding to the crisis, but acknowledged
that the industry's preparedness was inadequate. This type of
accident was ``so highly unlikely that the consequences of it ...
were viewed as acceptable,'' he told the subcommittee.
   Seward this week became the first town outside Prince William
Sound to have oil wash up on a beach.
   ``If they (the Soviets) can capture oil out there and pick it up
before it blows on shore, that's much to our advantage,'' Seward
deputy city manager Darryl Schaefermeyer said.
   ``Our goal is to get the oil picked up and not wait until it
gets on beaches, and then have to clean beaches.''
   The oil that washed ashore near Seward was a taffy-like goop
mixed with seaweed, and was cleaned up Tuesday. But more oil was in
Resurrection Bay, and still more reported on nearby islands and
headlands of the Kenai Peninsula, including at Kenai Fjords
National Park.
   The oil has been streaming into the Gulf of Alaska from Prince
William Sound where the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef and spilled
10.1 million gallons of North Slope crude oil.
   Skimming in the often stormy gulf has been hampered by high seas
because small boats in operation can handle seas only to about 5
feet. Seas recently have run as high as 12 feet.
   Cleanup contingency planners didn't expect oil to get outside
Prince William Sound, which is largely protected from rough waves
by a series of islands.
   Exxon has about 20 skimmers working in the sound and the gulf.
Two operate out of Seward, ``and of course we have several booming
operations involving a whole armada of fishing vessels,'' said
Coast Guard Lt. John Kwietniak.
   It was the second time in less than a year that a huge Soviet
ship aided rescue efforts in Alaska. Last October the Soviet
icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev smashed its way through the frozen
waters off Point Barrow to help free two California gray whales
trapped in the ice.
   Seward is named for former Secretary of State William Seward,
the man who bought yet-unexplored Alaska from Russia for $7.2
million in 1867. Doubters dubbed it ``Seward's Folly.''

   U.S. diplomats apparently heeded an official
warning and canceled seats on Pan Am flights in the weeks before
the bombing of Flight 103 last Dec. 21, according to airline
documents quoted in a congressional memorandum.
   The House Government Operations transportation subcommittee
staff memo says Pan Am documents indicate that Christmas holiday
traffic for U.S. embassy personnel had been heavily re-booked
before the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.
   Relatives of those who died in the bombing have been angry that
a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warning of a possible
bombing of a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt, West Germany to the
United States was not made public. They say diplomats would have
acted on the warnings and canceled Pan Am flights.
   The subcommittee memo, made available to The Associated Press,
notes that Pan Am has denied that there were any threats aimed
specifically at Flight 103 in the two weeks before the bombing.
   According to the memo, one of the Pan Am documents, barely
legible, says: ``Of course, we are telling pax (passengers) of PA
security measures FRA (Frankfurt).''
   Another document involves a request ``for public information
guidelines in view that about 80 percent of holiday traffic of
embassy is rebooking.''
   But there is no further explanation of that statement, nor is
there any indication that the rebookings specifically involved
Flight 103. The statement does not say which U.S. embassy is meant.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said there was
``no basis at all for the allegation that the U.S. Department of
State officials systematically canceled reservations on Flight 103
based on the FAA aviation security bulletin.''
   ``There is no evidence whatsoever of any systematic pattern of
canceled reservations for this flight by anyone or any group,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   But when asked if she had any information on whether
cancellations had occurred involving other flights, Ms. Tutwiler
said she could not immediately answer that question.
   In New York, Jeff Kriendler, vice president of corporate
communications for Pan Am, when asked if there had been large
numbers of diplomats canceling flights on Pan Am, said, ``There is
no indication that that was the case.''
   In Albany, N.Y., Paul Hudson, chairman of Victims of Flight 103,
said, ``We knew that diplomats had information regarding the
threats to Pan Am Flight 103. We are outraged at the cover-up and
apparent lies of the State Department.''
   ``We have felt from the beginning that government officials were
informed of the terrorists' threats and were able to change their
travel plans,'' said Hudson.
   The subcommittee has asked Pan Am for all internal documents
relating to security measures, to threats about Flight 103, and
information about who in Pan Am knew about any such threats.
   Contents of the March 13 subcommittee memo were first reported
by a London newspaper, The Independent. The memo says Pan Am should
be asked to provide details of lost revenue ``since Pan Am was
obviously keeping track of threat-related cancellations.'''
   The Federal Aviation Administration warning was prepared after
an anonymous caller to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland said a
bomb attack would be made in the two weeks after Dec. 5. The FAA
bulletin was sent to embassies so they could inform foreign
governments.
   Since the bombing of the New York-bound Boeing 747 over
Lockerbie, the United States and the Finnish police have maintained
that the telephoned warning was a hoax.
   Relatives of those who died on Flight 103 have maintained it was
inevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin, warning
friends and relatives and canceling Pan Am reservations.
   On April 7, Clayton McManaway, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for
counterterrorism, told the Senate: ``That is not true.''
   McManaway pointed out then that 31 U.S. government personnel
died in the bombing. He said the decision of the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow to post copies of the warning was not in accordance with
U.S. government policy.

<HEAD>DeConcini's Longtime Campaign Treasurer Under Investigation For Theft</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini's longtime campaign
treasurer has admitted taking some $500,000 from re-election bank
accounts, the senator's spokesman said Wednesday.
   U.S. Attorney Stephen M. McNamee wouldn't say whether charges
would be filed against accountant Thomas Karlsen of Mesa, who
joined the Arizona Democrat's campaign staff in 1974.
   McNamee took depositions Wednesday from other workers in the
Arizona Democrat's office here Wednesday. ``We just had a meeting
where they presented their evidence,'' McNamee said.
   In a telephone interview from Washington, Bob Maynes,
DeConcini's press secretary, said Karlsen promised to pay back the
money which he admitted to taking.
   ``But I think that to repay implies an ability that I do not
know is there,'' Maynes said. ``He said he would do everything he
could to make restitution, and he does have some financial
resources.''
   He said DeConcini was saddened by what he viewed as betrayal by
an insider.
   Karlsen has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached
for comment. Maynes said the Tempe resident was still in the
Phoenix area, but had ``left town'' April 10, leaving behind a note
that he didn't plan to return.
   ``He changed his mind and came back to the Phoenix area Sunday,
and he called Monday and admitted that he had done this,'' Maynes
said.
   He said it wasn't known how much money was missing. ``We're in
the process of trying to reconstruct the events,'' Maynes said.
   The funds apparently were withdrawn from certificate-of-deposit
accounts after they had been recorded, Maynes said.
   The first thefts took place about 1981, he said. Since then,
Karlsen has been divorced twice and had a series of business
reversals through his Karlsen &amp; Karlsen firm, Maynes added.
   Karlsen has been treasurer for several other Democrats,
including Richard Kimball, who ran unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate
seat, and Gov. Rose Mofford.
   Mofford campaign finance committee Chairwoman Lorraine Frank
said Karlsen resigned last week. She said no money was missing from
the governor's coffers.
   State Board of Accountancy records show Karlsen was certified as
a public accountant in 1972. Two years later, he met DeConcini and
became treasurer in time to help in DeConcini's successful 1976
campaign.
   A survey by the Common Cause organization showed DeConcini had a
$502,000 campaign surplus as of Dec. 31. The survey also said
DeConcini, whose 1988 campaign raised $3.3 million, had the
sixth-largest surplus among incumbent Senate candidates.

   Two jurors and an alternate juror in the
Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North did not tell the truth when they
said they had never been involved in court proceedings, ABC-TV news
reported Wednesday.
   The three could be disqualified, the network reported on ``World
News Tonight'' on the eve of jury deliberations in the trial of the
former White House aide.
   The jury is expected to begin deliberating Thursday after a
rebuttal argument by prosecutor John Keker and final instructions
from U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   ABC said the jurors apparently did not give full answers in a
questionnaire in which they were asked whether they or any member
of their families had ever been involved in civil or criminal court
proceedings.
   One juror answered ``no'' even though he was sued for $100,000
in 1981 as a result of an auto accident, and another juror said
``no'' even though she was sued in 1982 for $50,000 following a car
crash, ABC said.
   Both lawsuits were settled but constitute court proceedings
anyway, according to ABC.
   If Gesell decided to disqualify either or both jurors, the first
alternate would be named to take their place.
   That juror also answered ``no'' to the question but, ABC said a
computer check at Superior Court showed that the alternate was
arrested twice on drug charges and was put on probation for a year.
   Gesell was told of the findings but declined to comment, the
network said.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was a major figure in
the Iran-Contra scandal. He is charged with 12 criminal counts. The
charges include lying to Congress and the attorney general,
illegally converting traveler's checks to his own use and
conspiring to defraud the Treasury through a tax scam to support
the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government.

   A federal judge sentenced a Potomac man to 15
days in jail and fined him $20,000 Tuesday for cutting down 138
trees on a national park near his home to get a view of the Potomac
River.
   ``It is true that the area can be restored, but only with great
expense of time and resources, so a message must be sent to
others,'' U.S. District Judge J. Joseph Howard said while
sentencing Isaac Fogel. ``That message, gentlemen, is that one may
forfeit his or her liberty.''
   Fogel, 45, had the trees removed, then advertised his home has
having a river view, the government said in its indictment.
   ``I was willing to settle this thing when I first talked to the
parks department if they hadn't insisted on branding me a
criminal,'' Fogel said before sentencing.
   He was convicted earlier this year of destruction of government
timber, a misdemeanor, and disposing of government property, a
felony.
   He faced a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison and $350,000
in fines. Prosecutors recommended a $64,000 fine and a 60-day
sentence.
   ``I think the court gave the sentence we recommended serious
consideration and we are pleased with the sentence,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney David King said.
   The 138 trees in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National
Historical Park were valued at more than $30,000. King asked the
judge to fine Fogel twice the replacement value of the trees as
punishment.
   Fogel, president of a water bed manufacturing company in Jessup,
and his wife, Jo, bought the house in 1982, the indictment said.
   In March 1985, despite discussions with National Park Service
officials about what timber could be cut, Fogel hired a tree
service company to cut down the trees, the goverment contended.
   Fogel and his wife later listed the house and four acres for
sale, advertising it as having a river view, the indictment said.
The house, which has not been sold, was assessed for tax purposes
in 1986 at $381,510.
   Howard sentenced Fogel to concurrent three-year and six-month
sentences, suspending all but 15 days of the three-year sentence
and the entire six-month sentence. Fogel was also ordered to serve
two years' probation upon his release and perform 300 hours of
community service.
   Fogel is considering an appeal.

   NBC captured its fourth straight ratings
victory but the broadcast networks' audience continued to dwindle.
The networks blamed the scriptwriters' strike, cable and
independent TV stations, and negative reviews.
   The three networks' combined share of the prime-time TV audience
was 68 percent _ the lowest in television history and about 3
percent below last season, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Last year's five-month Writers Guild of America strike delayed
the usual September start of almost every series, forcing NBC, ABC
and CBS to produce ``writerproof'' programs such as news specials
and new productions of old scripts from series like ``Mission:
Impossible.''
   NBC escaped the brunt of the strike because it broadcast the
1988 Summer Olympics and the World Series, popular sports specials
unaffected by the labor dispute.

   A positive outlook on life appears to promote
natural killer cell activity for fighting disease in certain cancer
patients as well as healthy individuals, according to studies
presented today.
   ``It doesn't seem to be so much whether one is exposed to stress
or not, but how people are reacting to similar types of stress,''
said Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute and part of the research team.
   ``If they're not as well adjusted ... we have indication that it
has health consequences.''
   Herberman and Dr. Sandra Levy, an associate director at the

who combine standard medical care with psychotherapy have higher
natural killer cell activity than those who do not undergo

   Rising interest rates have caught up with American homeowners
and are pinching the pockets of the 12 million households with
adjustable-rate mortgages.
   For many of them, springtime '89 means a second annual hike in
mortgage payments _ 20 percent over a year ago on average _ since
that's when the bulk of U.S. homes are usually sold and mortgages
originated.
   This season also marks the first real test of interest-sensitive
adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs as they're called, in an era of
tightening credit. A government report issued earlier this week
showed a 5.4 percent drop in housing starts last month, evidence
that rising rates are already having a major impact on the economy.
Loan delinquencies could follow.
   ``We haven't seen this before,'' said Robert Van Order, chief
economist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co., or Freddie Mac.
``ARMs became popular in the early 1980s at the national level
after rates started to come down. This is the first period of
rising rates.''

<HEAD>Campaign Reform Knot: What's Fair?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since Republican and Democratic leaders agree,
it seems unanimous: there ought to be a law reforming campaign
finances to curb soaring costs and to create a fair, level playing
field for House and Senate candidates.
   The only trouble is that they cannot agree on what's fair and
what's level.
   Neither side can afford to be against reform of a system almost
everyone believes is too expensive, too distracting and too subject
to abuses.
   But the dominant Democrats aren't interested in legislating away
the advantages of incumbents, and the minority Republicans want
changes that could strengthen challengers.
   So they argue about what is and isn't reform.
   The most drastic of current proposals for campaign reform came
from President Bush, in what was almost an aside as he called for a
new ethics code for all federal officeholders.
   ``I believe we should eliminate contributions to candidates by
political action committees, and I'll be consulting with the
Congress about that, and I also oppose federal funding of
congressional campaigns,'' Bush said.
   Political action committees _ PACs _ are fund-raising groups
organized among officers and other people associated with
corporations, unions, interest groups and the like. The PACs raise
money from their members and dole it out to candidates, mostly to
incumbent senators and representatives.
   PACs sprang up and multiplied, in number and in dollars, because
of the stringent campaign contribution limits imposed in the reform
wave that followed Watergate.
   That's the trouble with reforms. As soon as they are devised,
somebody invents a way around them, and sometimes the new reformed
system is worse than the original problem.
   During the last campaign, political action committees reported
contributions of more than $150 million to House and Senate
candidates. Less than $19 million of that went to candidates
running against incumbent members of Congress.
   Because there are more Democratic incumbents, nearly two-thirds
of the PAC money went to Democrats. Republicans were particularly
incensed that in the past few elections, their ideological allies
from business PACs poured money into Democratic incumbents'
campaigns and generally stiffed GOP challengers.
   Political action committees can give a candidate up to $5,000
for each election, primary or general. They also can spend money
independently in support of a candidate. Individuals are limited to
$1,000 contributions to a candidate for each election.
   Republicans do better at party fund raising from individual
donors. Neither party has a monopoly on fat cats, but the GOP has
done a better job of cultivating the wealthy, encouraging them to
go to the maximum for the national party, its campaign committees
and for individual candidates.
   Those numbers point to the politics behind Bush's proposal for a
flat ban on PAC contributions.
   ``Modern democratic government works best when organized by
strong political parties and yet we have allowed our parties to
become weakened and overshadowed by special interests, and we can
best restore the role of the parties by limiting political action
committees,'' he said. ``PACs weaken the parties, restrain
competition and deaden the political debate.''
   The president's proposal would limit the PACs right out of
business, since they exist to make campaign contributions. Other
Republican proposals would limit the size of PAC contributions as
well as raise the limits on individual donations.
   Either formula would work to the advantage of candidates
challenging incumbents _ which usually means Republicans in House
elections, where the Democrats have an 86-seat margin. In the last
elections, more than 98 percent of incumbent congressional
candidates won new terms.
   Democratic leaders want legislation that would set voluntary
ceilings for congressional campaign spending, with a cap on PAC
contributions as part of the formula. Their reform plan includes
the public financing Bush rejects.
   ``He ran for president on public financing,'' said Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``If it's good for
presidential campaigns, why is it so bad for Senate campaigns?''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said what the
Democrats want ``boils down to an incumbency protection plan,''
with ceilings that would keep a challenger from spending what it
takes to offset the incumbent's advantages.
   Mitchell says the Republican goal is a setup that will preserve
their advantage in raising money from well-heeled individual
contributors.
   They're right.

<HEAD>MTV Network's Weak Sibling VH-1 Gets Boost, Microprogrammed To Baby
Boomers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   VH-1, once a poorly defined cable network
that believed what people over 30 wanted was Julio Iglesias music
videos, has finally found itself, as members of its baby boom
audience might say.
   VH-1's parent MTV Networks, which also has the big-time MTV and
Nickelodeon cable channels, has in recent months boosted VH-1's
staff and budget and given VH-1 chief Jeff Rowe his own pipeline to
network president and chief executive officer Tom Freston.
   The developments at VH-1 are what network television has most to
fear about cable: an entire broadcast agenda microprogrammed to one
very lucrative audience.
   While the networks take snatches of the age 25 to 49 audience
with shows like ``thirtysomething,'' ``China Beach,'' ``The Wonder
Years,'' and ``L.A. Law,'' they also have to reach viewers who were
unconscious from 1960 to 1980. Just watch ``Nightingales.''
   VH-1, its parent MTVN hopes, is for everyone who stayed awake
during those years.
   ``We feel this is a great chance to target the audience that
grew up on television and contemporary music,'' Rowe said in a
recent interview.
   The new VH-1 programming includes interview segments, clips of
classic and contemporary rock and pop, ``infotainment'' reporting
on show business, and special attention to weekends, when VH-1
watchers are more apt to set aside their graph charts and tune in.
   The theme weekends have included interviews, clips and concert
films devoted to Elton John, Paul Simon, Tina Turner and others.
   Rowe also acknowledged the challenge of reaching an audience
that includes Vietnam veterans, former peace marchers, sociologists
who became investment bankers and business majors who operate
halfway houses.
   ``A network that is targeted to fit this generation has to know
how it lives,'' he said ``We want to create an environment that
keeps people up on contemporary music, but also reflects their
past; has comedy about current events, but also is nostalgic.''
   To keep both ends of the candle burning, VH-1 is sponsoring a
``Million Dollar Baby'' contest for the offspring of baby boomers
and offers a series of Earth Alerts _ celebrity-hosted
informational spots keyed to the activities of the Greenpeace
organization.
   The ``Million Dollar Baby,'' sponsored by Gerber Products Co.
and Downy fabric softener, harkens back to the corporate-sponsored
contests of the 1950s. Entrants send in a photo of their offspring
from ages four months to 2{ years, with an April 24 deadline
looming. The winner will be announced May 8.
   The prize is a zero coupon municipal bond, worth $1 million at
maturity.
   The Earth Alerts are tied in with a celebrity fund-raiser album,
``Rainbow Warrior,'' due this month on Geffen Records.
``Environmental issues are still the issues of this generation,''
said VH-1 spokeswoman Dana Kornbluth.
   ``At the farthest end, there is not much we can do to shock this
audience,'' said Rowe. ``This audience did a lot of crazy things
back in the 1960s and 1970s ... we can't take ourselves too
seriously.''
   One of VH1's best efforts to catch the spin of its viewers
recently failed with the cancellation of the ``Watch Bobby Rivers''
interview show. Rivers remains with the network as a host, and he
is typical of the exuberant, insightful personality VH-1 is seeking
for its audience.
   The 35-year-old Rivers grew up in the Willowbrook neighborhood
of Los Angeles and graduated from Verbum Dei High School _ where he
was president of the library club _ and Marquette University. He's
a bookish, energetic personality who came to VH-1 from WPIX-TV in
New York and before that was an interviewer for the syndicated ``PM
Magazine.''
   His first exposure to the power of television was the Watts
Riots in August of 1965, just a few blocks from his home.
   ``We were all in the living room watching the riot on TV, and it
looked like all of Los Angeles was going up,'' Rivers said. ``But
no, it really was just a very small community. But from what was on
TV, people in Redondo Beach (a Los Angeles suburb) were ready to
pack up and leave town.''

<HEAD>Passover Liberation Seen Mirrored In Exodus Of Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A modern parallel is unfolding of the ancient
Passover story of liberation _ the rising exodus of Jews permitted
by the Soviet Union.
   The resemblances were cited as the week-long Passover observance
started Wednesday evening, marking the Jewish flight from bondage
in Egupt.
   However, Jews today don't have to rely on rituals of the past,
says Theodore Ellenoff, president of the American Jewish Committee.
``Before our very eyes, the gates of the Soviet Union have been
thrown open, and Jews are using the opportunity to stream out.''
   During the first three months of this year, 9,461 Jews have been
allowed to emigrate from the Soviet, triple the number in the same
period last year, with projections the 1989 total may reach 40,000.
   That would be the third year of a steadily rising surge of
departures under the more open policies of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Shoshana Cardin, chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, applauds the increased emigrations and improvements in
religious and cultural rights of Soviet Jews, but adds: ``Our
priority this Passover remains our often voiced demand, `Let our
people go.'
   ``We will not be silent until every Jew who wishes to emigrate
is free to do so, until every Jew who wishes to remain in the
Soviet Union is allowed full cultural and religious rights.''
   The demand, ``Let my people go,'' originally was flung by the
ancient Jewish leader Moses at the Egyptian Pharaoh in the world's
earliest struggle for religious freedom nearly 4,000 years ago.
   ``Those words still are relevant,'' says Gerald Strober,
information officer of the NCSJ. ``Pharaoh has begun to loosen up
and we welcome it. But we must remain ever vigilant.''
   Moderating conditions for Soviet Jews, however, were seen as
similar to the Jewish deliverance from oppression in Egypt, the
Passover event which has become a universal symbol of human
liberation.
   As in the case of the ancient Israelites, the troubles weren't
over for Soviet Jews after being let out of the country.
   About 7,000 of them are stranded at a center near Rome, most of
them wanting to come to the United States, but exceeding U.S.
quotas or refused U.S. refugee status as fleeing persecution.
   Israel accepts all wishing to go there, but the logjam has
persisted, with efforts being made in this country to modify the
restrictions.
   In the light of the ancient liberation from Egypt, Ellenoff
said, ``It is no surprise that the new mass emigration of Soviet
Jewry has raised new perplexities.
   ``Our Bible teaches that physical emancipation is just the
beginning of a long, painstaking redemptive process. We read that
the freed Israelites complained bitterly to Moses about the
hardships of freedom.
   ``When they had been slaves, the masters had taken care of their
basic needs in return for obedient subservience. Only now, with
emancipation, did the Israelites have to worry about food, water
and protection from armed attack.''
   While more Jews are being allowed to leave the Soviet Union, the
situation for those still there has moderated. Added facilities are
being provided, and the NCSJ says all 15 Jewish prisoners of
concience have been released.
   Manhattan's Park Avenue synagogue for the second successive year
airlifed Passover supplies to Soviet Jewish congregations in Moscow
and Odessa _ two tons of matzoth, wine, gefilte fish and other
kosher foods for Passover.
   Rabbi Arthur Schneier, leader of the Manhattan congregation and
head of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, recently negotiated
the return to Moscow's Choral Synagogue of an adjoining building
for a community center.
   He said the center, when refurbished through funding by the
Manhattan synagogue, would provide a lecture hall, meeting rooms
and classrooms for Jewish adult education, courses in Bible, Jewish
history and Hebrew and a kosher restaurant.
   Soviet Jews are celebrating Passover with a new haggadah _
recounting God's deliverances _ in Russian and Hebrew, published by
Moscow's Choral Synagogue with help of the U.S. Memorial Foundation
for Jewish Culture.
   The Soviet's Jewish population has been estimated at about 2
million, and how many want to leave is uncertain. The NCSJ says
that several years ago it estimated the figure at more than
300,000, but it now may be less.
   Questions remain about various aspects of the situation,
Ellenoff says, and the answers may not come quickly. ``After all,''
he adds, ``it took 40 years for the emancipated Israelites to reach
the promised land.''

<HEAD>New Names in the Money-Fund Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the biggest names in the mutual fund
industry have created new money market funds boasting yields that
beat all their older competitors.
   They are getting an enthusiastic response from savers and
investors scrambling after the high returns available in short-term
money market investments.
   But experts on mutual fund investing urge that you look beyond
the current yield figures these funds sport before you decide
whether they suit your purposes.
   In figures compiled early this month by Donoghue's Moneyletter,
the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund and the Fidelity
Spartan Money Market Fund ran neck and neck for the No. 1 spot with
seven-day yields of 10.4 percent.
   The average yield of 542 taxable money funds, by contrast, was
9.08 percent.
   How can Dreyfus and Fidelity do this? Well, for one thing, their
timing was fortuitous. Since the new funds were organized in a
period when interest rates were climbing, they were able to stock
their portfolios with the latest high-yielding securities the
marketplace had to offer.
   Older funds, by contrast, could accumulate new, higher-yielding
securities only gradually as their assets increased and existing
investments in their portfolios matured.
   More to the point, however, is a marketing strategem that has
been used many times before when a new fund is introduced: Dreyfus
and Fidelity are temporarily paying the funds' expenses and waiving
their management fees.
   ``It's smart to take advantage of these situations, but watch
these funds closely,'' says Sheldon Jacobs in his newsletter The
No-Load Fund Investor.
   ``They can stop waiving expenses without notice and their yield
advantages will disappear.''
   The charges Dreyfus isn't collecting effectively increase the
Worldwide Dollar fund's yield by 0.7 of a percentage point, notes
Norman Fosback, editor of the newsletter Income &amp; Safety, while the
difference at Fidelity Spartan is 0.6 of a point.
   ``Frankly, we are ambivalent regarding this promotional
technique,'' Fosback says.
   ``The upside is that such funds offer adroit investors an
opportunity _ albeit brief _ to earn far-above-average returns. The
downside is that savers seeking these opportunities may end up with
their money in a fund whose performance may prove to be below
average in the long run.
   ``Of course, there is nothing to prevent you from withdrawing
from a fund once the fee waiver and expense assumption ends, but
the funds are counting on many investors being too poorly informed
or lazy to move their money out.''
   Even after they have stopped waiving fees and expenses, it's
possible that the Worldwide Dollar and Fidelity Spartan funds will
do well.
   Fosback says the Worldwide Dollar fund, with a somewhat
different investment policy, can be expected to outperform by at
least a small margin its huge sister fund, Dreyfus Liquid Assets.
   Fidelity, meanwhile, says the Spartan Fund will continue to
carry lower fees and expenses than the long-established Fidelity
Cash Reserves fund, in part because Spartan shareholders will pay
separate charges for services offered ``free'' to investors in most
other money funds.
   For example, Spartan holders pay $2 apiece for checks to write
against their accounts, and the fund has a $5 redemption fee.
   Logically, then, Fidelity Spartan would seem to appeal to savers
and investors who use a mutual fund as a long-term savings account
rather than as a tool in a busy program of money management.
   For people who take such a long-term perspective, financial
advisers agree, the latest seven-day or 30-day yield figure at a
given money fund isn't of overriding importance. What matters is
how well the fund is managed in all types of economic environments.
   As Donoghue's Moneyletter advises, ``Make sure your fund is a
consistent performer.''

<HEAD>Privatization Alive And Well _ Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the mid-1970s when Robert Poole Jr. was
developing the notion of private enterprise being able to do
government's work better than government, he could hardly have
foreseen one of the twists that ensued.
   The concept seemed to thrive in the United States. Organizations
were formed to promote it. It was embraced by President Reagan. New
laws encouraged private initiative. The White House named a
director of privatization.
   But while the concept thrived domestically, action did not
always follow. Surprisingly, much of the privatization developed
abroad, in Japan and Britain, and incredibly, in the big-government
communist world.
   Meanwhile, Poole has continued to develop his ideas, mainly
through the Reason Foundation, an organization he founded in Santa
Monica, Calif., and which he still runs. Each year it publishes a
progress report on privatization.
   The latest, just issued, reports that governments around the
world continue to shift functions and responsibilities to the
private sector, to the extent of $43 billion of sales in 1988 alone.
   That amount brought the worldwide cumulative total to $160
billion in just five years, and in almost every instance the basic
notion was the same, that private initiative could result in more
efficient management and services.
   In 1988, Britain relieved itself of an obligation and fattened
its treasury by selling British Steel to private investors. Japan
sold off Nippon Telephone &amp; Telegraph for the same reasons.
   The Third World, struggling to survive in a more competitive
world market, recognized the possibilities. Nigeria issued a decree
that will result in the sale of 67 companies, including 12 banks.
Chile plans to sell the government pension fund, and has already
sold $1 billion in state firms since 1985.
   Asset sales tell only part of the story. Increasingly popular
are Build-Operate-Transfer agreements whereby a private company
agrees to build and operate a public facility for the government
for a set time period.
   B-O-Ts are being used to build a major power plant and rail
transit system in Turkey, a new harbor tunnel in Sydney, Australia,
and power plants in the Philippines. And, in of all places, a
181-mile tollway in China.
   Surprising? Not really. Privatization is being widely embraced
by nations that once felt it was the function of government to
operate all enterprises.
   The Soviet Union has joined China in allowing farmers to lease
land from the state and buy their own trucks, tractors and
equipment. Both have begun programs allowing individuals to buy
houses and apartments from the state.
   Several communist countries are permitting private buusinesses
to start up. Hundreds of co-ops were begun in the Soviet Union in
1988. Poland has gone further, with 23,000 co-ops authorized, each
allowed to hire 50 workers per shift. Hungary now permits private
companies employing up to 500 workers.
   The Soviet Union is in the process of breaking up of many
collective farms and the leasing farm land to individuals, families
and small groups. The report states that one-fifth of the country's
50,000 farms have been leasing land and equipment to individuals
and families over the past two years.
   In contrast to these efforts _ all of which promote the belief
that private initiative results in more efficient production and
delivery of goods and services _ is the United States, which the
report states ``is virtually alone in having no serious national
commitment to privatization.''
   During the entire eight years of the Reagan administration, it
states, the only large federal enterprise to be sold off was
Conrail.
   There was additional action, but hardly enough to support the
rhetoric. During 1988 the government reached an agreement to sell
the Great Plains Coal Gasification plant for $600 million over 21
years. And $4.6 billion was realized from the sale of federal loan
assets in 1987 and 1988.
   A presidential commission has recommended using various form of
privatization, including contracting jobs rather than doing them
in-house, the direct sales of assets and other means to alleviate
budget pressures.
   And a Reason Foundation task force recommends the privatization
of Amtrak, the Tennessee Valley Authority and other power
facilities, the U.S. Postal Service and the nation's airports and
air traffic control centers.
   Will it happen? The lack of momentum suggests it won't occur for
a long while. While President Bush has said repeatedly he supports
the concept, privatization advocates fear the White House effort is
being downgraded.
   What an oddity, say those who support privatization: The United
States, which symbolizes private initiative and taught it to much
of the world, is now showing less initiative than some Third World
and communist nations.

<HEAD>Minister Says Recognizing UFOs Could Boost Biblical Faith</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smile indulgently about it if so inclined.
That's OK with the Rev. Barry H. Downing. But he firmly maintains
that UFOs are real and that they have key religious significance.
   He says recognizing the existence and operations of these
Unidentified Flying Objects could do much to strengthen faith and
renew confidence in biblical accounts.
   ``It would establish scientific plausiblity for the whole
biblical field,'' he says. ``It would reinforce faith and make it
possible in a scientific context.''
   Downing, a Presbyterian pastor with a scientific bent, says
government equivocation has caused skepticism about UFOs and so he
expects some scoffing at his views.
   ``You have to have a good humor about it,'' he said in an
interview. ``I can't prove I'm right, but there's lots of evidence
for it, and until it wins out, some people are just going to have
to laugh.''
   He theorizes that activities of UFO-borne ``higher beings'' or
``angels,'' likely from another dimension rather than other
planets, are indicated in biblical events ranging from guiding the
Israelites from Egypt to Christ's ascension.
   He said postulating such activities in forming biblical faith
would open a middle ground between fundamentalist literalism and
liberal theology's ``demythologizing'' of supernatural events as
only symbolic.
   ``It would cut down the distance between liberals and
fundamentalists, and serve as a mediating force between the two
extremes,'' he said.
   ``The mythological concepts would have to be re-examined, which
would be important for the liberal wing. The conservative wing,
which stresses certainty and wants everything locked up tight, also
would be impacted.
   ``This would mean unlocking things.''
   Downing, 50, an Endwell, N.Y., pastor, has a B.A. in physics
and, after completing Princeton Theological Seminary, got a
doctorate at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland on relations
of science and religion.
   He details his ideas about UFOs and about eternity as a
coexisting universe, based on Einstein's relativity theory, in a
new paperback edition of his book, ``The Bible and Flying
Saucers,'' issued by Berkely Books.
   ``What is clear through the biblical material is that God's will
for the Jews, and eventually for all mankind, was `revealed' by
beings from another world,'' he writes.
   ``Usually these beings looked very much like ordinary human
beings (they almost never have wings) ... Once the `package' of
biblical religion had been delivered, man became responsible for
the distribution of the contents...''
   Downing said a hovering, UFO-like ``cloud'' by day, and glowing
``pillar of fire'' by night guided the Israelites out of Egypt,
projecting some propulsive force that parted the Red Sea, leading
them for years across the desert.
   Other events he sees as carried out by UFOs include:
   The fire-like phenomenon on Mount Sinai in which Moses received
the Ten Commandments, the Prophet Elijah taken to heaven in a fiery
chariot, the star of Bethlehem, the engulfing light of Jesus'
transfiguration, his being ``lifted up'' at his ascension and the
blinding visitation of Paul en route to Damascus.
   ``All these were UFO types of reports,'' Downing said.
   Downing, pastor for 22 years of Endwell's Northminster
Presbyterian Church, also is theological consultant to the Mutual
UFO network, based in Seguin, Texas, and Fund for UFO Research,
based in Washington.
   Recalling a 1969 government commission finding that Air Force
observations offered ``insufficience evidence'' to substantiate
UFOs, Browning said the government was ``covering up'' and the full
report never was released.
   He displayed a 1975 letter from then-Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R.-Ariz., saying the material was being withheld as ``above Top
Secret.''
   ``If the government weren't lying in denying UFOs exist, we'd
have had a religious revolution starting 40 years ago,'' Browning
said. ``It would not mean undermining biblical faith, but
reinterpreting it in light of UFO phenomena.''
   In the pulpit, Downing said he rarely brings his UFO ideas into
sermons, recognizing the controversial aspects, although members
are aware of his interest in the subject. He added:
   ``Three or four have said they've had UFO experiences.''

   Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern
Orthodox representatives held a four-day annual workshop on
Christian unity this week, with optimism expressed about progress
in that cause.
   ``We have made great progress,'' says the Rev. Thaddeus Horgan
of the Catholic bishops' committee on ecumenical affairs, and a
planner of the workshop. ``There is lots of agreement, a lot of
common study.''
   He said the movement has developed such strength that that it
can't be derailed by issues such as abortion. He said positive
steps toward unity can be made despite diversity, and added:
   ``We are long past the getting-to-know-you phase. We are at what
you might call the hard aspect. But we're not moving away. We are
facing it head-on.''

   Representatives of North Korean Christians, once
thought to have been totally eliminated by the Communist regime or
driven deep underground, are making their first visit to the United
States in more than 50 years.
   The four-member delegation, invited by the National Council of
Churches, takes part in a conference in Washington April 23-26 on
unifying Korea, and also will visit various denominational
headquarters in Louisville, Ky.; Elgin, Ill.; Chicago and
Indianapolis.
   The Rev. Dwain Epps, NCC international affairs officer, says,
``Only in very recent times have foreign church representivies had
opportunities to visit North Korea and to discover that worshipping
communities continue to exist there.''

   A clergyman involved in a reshaping of
Lutheranism, the Rev. John H. Tietjen, has been named pastor of the
750-member Trinity Lutheran Church in Fort Worth, Texas.
   Tietjen, who resigned in 1987 after serving briefly as Lutheran
bishop in Chicago, was a key figure among moderates who in the
1970s broke away from the conservative Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod and formed a new denomination.
   Its formation stepped up processes that led to merger with two
other Lutheran denominations, resulting in the 5-million-member
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, with headquarters here.

<HEAD>China Facing Worst Energy Crisis in Decades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Xinghua Clothing Factory has abandoned plans
to buy new machines from Japan because it doesn't have the
electricity to run them.
   ``Without the right connections it would take years to get
approval for the extra power,'' said Man Ying, energy manager at
the 250-employee factory in Beijing.
   The factory also can't buy air conditioners for the sweltering
summers and this past winter went days without heat because of a
lack of coal.
   ``We send out special teams to look for coal,'' she said, adding
that they sometimes must pay free market sellers and profiteers up
to 130 yuan ($35) a ton for it, three times the state-set rate.
   Xinghua is forced to shut down once a six-day week, every
Friday, in the midst of the worst energy crisis in Communist
China's 40-year history.
   But it is more fortunate than factories in the key industrial
cities of Shanghai and Shenyang, which operate only three or four
days of their usual six-day week. In parts of Jiangsu province,
another industrial center near Shanghai, up to a third of the
factories were closed and 40 percent of the power plants had
stopped working at the end of the year because of coal shortages.
   In Beijing, 500 factories employing 100,000 now operate only on
night shifts because they have no power during the day.
   Not only factories are affected.
   In Beijing, a city of 10 million people, elevators in high-rise
buildings don't work, new color televisions sit idle and people
stock up on candles.
   The official Guangming Daily noted that even the headquarters of
the Energy Resources Ministry has been ordered to shut off all
electrical appliances every Thursday.
   China has been losing an average 200 billion yuan ($54 billion)
a year during the 1980s due to power cuts. Last year the losses
were believed to be double that as up to one-third of production
capacity was unused.
   The crisis reflects the inability of energy production to match
the nation's explosive industrial growth. Industrial output
increased by more than 20 percent in 1988, but production of coal,
used for 70 percent of China's energy, was up only 4 percent.
   Energy supplies have also failed to cope with China's new-found
prosperity which has resulted in a surge of demand for televisions,
refrigerators, microwaves and other electrical appliances. In
Beijing last year, energy consumption by households jumped 29
percent, while power supply was up by only 3 percent.
   The Guangming Daily noted that one large luxury hotel in Beijing
today consumes as much energy as all of Beijing did in the early
1950s.
   Another problem is that China, although the world's largest
producer of coal with 970 million tons last year, can't get the
power to the places it is needed.
   Most of the nation's coal is mined in the north, but industry is
centered mainly along the southern coast. Half the country's badly
overtaxed railway system and a third of river transport is devoted
to carrying coal, but that still wasn't enough. Last year about 8
million tons, or 3.5 percent of the state coal supply quota, was
not delivered.
   According to a report in the weekly publication Outlook
(Liaowang), one large coal mine in Shanxi province, in the heart of
coal country, had to stop operations temporarily because it lacked
fuel to run its bulldozers.
   Low investment in energy industries, inefficient small mines and
artificially low state-set prices for energy have widened the gap
between supply and demand. Profiteering by officials with access to
coal supplies _ even in the army _ is pandemic.
   Coal should sell for the state-price equivalent of $8 to $11 a
ton but it goes for $54 to $80 after passing through the hands of
various middlemen on its way to Shanghai or Canton.
   The government is considering various possible solutions,
including more investment in energy production, higher taxes for
energy use and higher energy prices, to achieve what appears to be
an impossible goal of producing 1.5 billion tons of coal by the
year 2000.
   China now has no nuclear power but is building two plants along
the southern coast and has plans for others.
   As a stopgap measure, the government is hoping that its harsh
austerity campaign begun last fall will slow the economy down
enough to relieve the energy crisis.
   ``If we consider energy to be the lifeblood of modern society,''
the Guangming Daily said, ``today's China can be compared to a
patient suffering from anemia.''

<TEXT>
   How different George Bush's first 100 days are
from Ronald Reagan's.
   No battering of Washington's ways by a charismatic Californian.
No outsider's hand on the helm, setting the government on its
sharpest course change since the New Deal.
   These 100 days have brought only modest course corrections by a
captain long used to walking the deck of the ship of state.
   ``Reagan came in as an ideologue. He came up in politics that
way, as a crusader,'' said James L. Sundquist, senior fellow
emeritus in governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
   ``Bush has no crusade to carry out. It hasn't been a very
dramatic hundred days.''
   No, it hasn't.
   By April 29, 1981, the 100th day of his presidency, Reagan was
on his way to full recovery after the attempt on his life and was
making it ever more clear that his energies were devoted not to the
question of whether there would be budget and tax cuts, but to how
deeply he could slash.
   Kenneth Duberstein, who handled relations with the House during
Reagan's first months in office, says the assassination attempt and
Reagan's devotion to the themes of his campaign _ shaking up the
ways government raises and spends money, steering the economy out
of its doldrums and strengthening the nation's defenses _
determined the tenor of that first 100 days.
   Of the assassination attempt, Duberstein says:
   ``The way he handled it _ with humor and dignity and class and
with good grace _ struck a very responsive chord in the American
public. I think it continued the honeymoon and helped the process
of making Ronald Reagan larger than life.''
   Of Reagan's priorities, Duberstein, who later became Reagan's
chief of staff, pointed to the significance of the decision ``that
it is much better to communicate two or three major priorities
rather than setting up 40 or 50 priorities.
   ``There was a lot of arguing back and forth, but we had a game
plan and a strategy and we stuck to it.''
   Bush, on the other hand, has divided his energies among a number
of initiatives:
   _He gave Capitol Hill a plan to bail out and reform the savings
and loan industry. Congressional committees have made significant
changes.
   _He and Congress agreed to a nearly $28 billion
deficit-reduction plan that leaves the hard choices about cutting
federal red ink for the future.
   _He secured congressional agreement to continue non-military aid
to the Contras, but agreed to halt the aid in November unless four
committees allow it to continue.
   _He submitted a $441 million education package. It has been met
with little enthusiasm.
   For much of Bush's first 100 days, however, the overriding issue
in his dealings with the Democratic-controlled Congress was his
nomination of John Tower as defense secretary.
   After a bruising confirmation battle, the Senate rejected the
former Texas senator 53-47 on March 9. It was the first time in 30
years that a president's nomination to his Cabinet had been turned
down.
   Opinions differ on whether the Tower defeat will impair Bush's
dealings with Congress or whether he repaired the damage with his
swift and popular second choice of Dick Cheney, one of Congress'
own.
   ``The whole town seems to have put the Tower thing behind us,
and I didn't think we would ever do that,'' said Tom Korologos,
veteran Washington lobbyist who handled congressional relations for
the Reagan transition team.
   ``I think it was a minor blip when we look back at it,'' said
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover
Institution in Palo Alto, Calif., who was Reagan's first domestic
policy adviser.
   On the other hand, Bayard L. Catron, a professor of public
administration at George Washinton University and an expert on
government ethics, said, ``It really did hurt the administration.
It detracted from everything else they were doing at the time.''
   And a Republican strategist who spoke on condition he not be
identified said, ``I think it demonstrated a vulnerability which
people will tuck away for later on.''
   Korologos, contrasting Reagan's entry into office with Bush's,
said, ``It was a lot different because we had to show everything
that (former President) Carter wasn't.''
   As for the Bush administration, he said, ``They were just
chipping away at the edges and trying to make course corrections a
little bit, so it was a whole lot different operation.''
   Anderson, from a slightly different perspective, said, ``The
worse the situation is when you take over as a new president, the
easier it is to look good. Bush has a much more difficult problem.
Given the different situation Bush inherited and what he is working
with, the politics of it, he is doing as well on an equivalent
basis.''
   Sundquist, on the other hand, said that Bush ``had no particular
program that he outlined in his campaign, and he hasn't announced
one since ... Bush is simply carrying on, playing around the
edges.''
   Not only have Reagan and Bush faced different situations, they
are different types of people.
   Donald T. Regan, another Reagan chief of staff, described his
boss' role in shaping the economic recovery package this way in his
book, ``For the Record'':
   ``The president himself had very little to do with the invention
and the implementation of the policies and mechanisms...He was
content to exercise the symbolic powers of his office _ and his
astonishing skill in doing so was of course the very thing that
made success possible.''
   Bush, on the other hand, is a veteran of the nuts and bolts of
government. ``He's got a managerial interest, which Reagan never
had,'' said Catron, the professor of public administration.
   Another difference was highlighted by the GOP strategist who
spoke on the condition of anonymity: ``Reagan always tried to make
a headline every day or get on the network news, and Bush seems not
to be particularly concerned about it.''
   Administration officials have told reporters they don't think
the 100-day yardstick, first applied in the administration of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, is applicable to Bush.
   Korologos agreed, saying that FDR, taking office in the depths
of the Depression, ``had to do it in 100 days.''
   ``Bush doesn't have to do it in 100 days. He's got four years to
do it.''
   Sundquist, however, cautioned that ``anything the president
wants to get done in his term usually has to be done within the
first year, which means it has to be under way within the first few
months.
   ``Whether it is 100 days or 180 days is a minor point, but very
little happens in the second, third and fourth years of any
president's term. So the honeymoon period has to be used for
important initiatives, and it has not been in this case.''

   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space Friday to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of Venus and the
evolution of our own Earth.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday, and six hours later,
Atlantis' five astronauts are to release Magellan on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in 1978, and Magellan will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches Venus in August 1990, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and Venus, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the 1978 Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   Magellan is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from Atlantis this year. The Galileo probe to Jupiter is
to set forth in October.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in 1986. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in January 1986, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Saunders said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
Russia's Venera 1, which scouted Venus in 1961. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The United States has successfully sent five probes to Venus,
six to Mars, four to Jupiter, three to Saturn, and one each to
Mercury and Uranus. And in August, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at Neptune.
   The Soviet Union has sent 19 successful spacecraft to Venus and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 last September while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of Jupiter; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of Saturn; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, NASA is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet Earth, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of Earth when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that Venus may represent what
might happen to Earth if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring Saturn that NASA reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune next August.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around Jupiter, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to Earth's hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like Earth's northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by Saturn, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form Titan's surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval Earth between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found Saturn's atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, Mariner and Pioneer probes found
that Venus is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through Venus' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on Earth.
   Photographs taken of Mercury by Mariner 10 in 1974 and 1975
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard Mariner 10 found that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the Earth's and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976 and 1977
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier Mariners found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce summer storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

   Wendy Kilbourne says she believes her
character in ``Midnight Caller,'' the wealthy owner of the radio
station that employs provocative talk show host Jack Killian,
probably asked her father for a radio station when she turned 21.
   ``A big point is made that she didn't just kick back and say I'm
playing with radio,'' Kilbourne said. ``It was an ailing station
and she turned it around.''
   The series plots bring station owner Devon King into regular
conflict with Killian (Gary Cole), a former San Francisco detective
whose late-night show turns him into an urban hero.
   ``I think she and Jack are friends,'' Kilbourne said. ``I like
the relationship because it's not burdened with sexual tensions.
There is a mutual attraction. I think the writers are trying to
have these people's vision widened by the other's point of view.
There's a real friendship developing between the characters. I like
that.''
   The one-hour series, filmed on location in San Francisco, has
been doing well in the ratings and consistently wins its time slot.
   ``I got the role by auditioning for it, which is a very painful
process,'' Kilbourne said on a visit to Los Angeles. ``I was
interviewing for another job and forgot about the appointment with
the producers of `Midnight Caller.' My agent called and said I'd be
late.
   ``I raced over, preoccupied with the other show, and read
directly off the page. They said thank you. I got into my car and
banged my head on the steering wheel. I marched into my agent's
office to tell her never to schedule me like that again. She said
they'd called and wanted to test me.''
   Kilbourne was born into the motion picture business, but her
mother whisked her out of town as soon as possible.
   ``My mother didn't want to have anything to do with Hollywood,''
she said. ``Her father had written `The Wizard of Oz.' I grew up in
San Mateo, LaCanada and Newport Beach. I had a very normal
childhood.''
   Kilbourne's grandfather was Noel Langley, one of the
screenwriters who adapted the Frank L. Baum fantasy for the 1939
classic motion picture.
   ``My mother was looking for stability. She's an artist, and
while she appreciates the creative aspects of the business, she
wanted to provide a stable environment for her children. She had
grown up in boarding schools in England.''
   Despite her mother's aversion to Hollywood, Kilbourne began
studying drama when her mother married an actor involved with the
Shakespeare Festival. She began studying with the South Coast
Repertory Theater, then enrolled at Orange Coast College.
   ``During that time I rediscovered my love of acting,'' she said.
``It had been a bit of a conflict because my family was
academically oriented and I was studying political science. It was
a time when I could have gone either way. I dropped out of college
and pursued acting full-time.''
   Once she turned professional things moved swiftly.
   ``I don't remember having a time when I could say I can rest
now,'' she said. ``I don't think it's in my personality to sit
back. I'm very critical and demanding of myself. Every time I see
my work I say I'm better than I was a year ago, but I've got a long
way to go.''
   Her first professional film role was two lines in an episode of
``The Paper Chase.''
   She was Constance Flynn Hazzard in the ABC miniseries ``North
and South.''
   ``I was the Irish girl whose father was the doctor in the
Mexican War,'' she said. ``Robert Mitchum played my father. That's
when I meet George Hazzard and we marry. I worked very hard on the
Irish accent. Everyone around me was speaking with a South Carolina
accent.''
   She was in both parts of ``North and South.'' Her screen romance
and marriage to George Hazzard, played by James Reade, developed
offscreen as well. They were married last October.
   ``Pretty Hollywood, huh?'' said Kilbourne.
   Her husband also has appeared in ``Beaches'' and ``Eight Men
Out.''
   Kilbourne also starred in ``Nothing in Common,'' a brief 1987
series. She has been a guest star in various series and starred in
two TV movies, ``Calendar Girl Murders'' and ``Going To the
Chapel.''

<HEAD>Shareholders Reject Lending Resolution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Citicorp shareholders have overwhelmingly
rejected requests from church groups led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
and representatives of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu to
sever all remaining ties with racially segregated South Africa.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, stopped doing
business in that country two years ago when it sold its Citibank
N.A. Ltd. subsidiary to First National Bank of Southern Africa
Ltd., South Africa's largest bank, for about $65 million.
   But Citicorp, like some other U.S. banks, still has about $666
million in private outstanding loans to South African borrowers. It
recently agreed to extend by 10 years payments on the bulk of that
debt, and accept partial principal payment as part of an agreement
with other international banks.
   South Africa had placed a temporary moratorium on principal
payments of bank debt in September 1985.
   The church groups had asked that Citicorp, which remains the
largest U.S. commercial bank creditor of that country, to refuse to
reschedule South African debt and make any new loans as long as the
present political system remains intact.
   ``By extending this debt we're expressing a tolerance of South
Africa,'' Jackson said Tuesday at Citicorp's annual shareholders
meeting. ``We must make a moral judgment.''
   Citicorp Chairman John Reed said that while his company opposes
South Africa's apartheid system ``debt forgiveness is a word you'll
never hear from this bank.''
   ``Our objective is simple and straightforward: We would like to
be paid back. It's not a question of morals ... it's a question of
business judgment,'' he explained.
   Citicorp shareholders also agreed, with 91.6 percent of them
voting against a proposal to abandon debt rescheduling agreements
with South Africa, vs. 8.4 percent approving it. The remaining
abstained.
   The shareholders also rejected a request by the church groups
for Citicorp to end corresponent banking with South Africa, in
which it performs services for firms not having access to direct
facilities. The vote was 89.2 percent opposed, 10.8 percent in
agreement and the rest abstaining.

   Ross Kapstein has been teaching long enough to
know that kids aren't exactly wild about learning economics. So he
came up with a novel way of presenting the often-dry curriculum:
through the lyrics of rap music.
   Kapstein, who has dabbled in the music business as a performer
and manager during his 18 years as a public school teacher, wrote
and recorded ``RUN G.N.P.,'' a rappin' tribute to the joys of
economics.
   He also had some of his students at Martin Luther King Jr.
Middle School participate in making a video version of the song.
Kapstein uses both as motivational tools to make economics seem
less imposing to the 6th-, 7th- and 8th-grade students in his
social studies and history classes.
   Rather than the academic words of a textbook, Kapstein believes
teachers could better introduce young students to economic concepts
with such lines as:
   ``Try to maximize profits
   Minimize costs
   That's what I'm tryin' to do
   Increase productivity
   Improve the quality
   So I can bring the best product to you.''
   Or how about this explanation of supply and demand:
   ``Now, when resources get scarce
   or demand increases
   the price of goods rise
   it rarely decreases.
   People's tastes change
   and so do I
   If I want to stay in business
   I'd better comply.''
   And, you can dance to it.
   ``I thought it was a good idea in this day and age, when kids
can rap and memorize pages and pages of (entertainment)
information, why not do something educational to go along with
it,'' Kapstein said in a recent interview.
   ``Economics is sometimes boring and difficult,'' he said. ``I
saw this would be a really nice idea. Hell, I write music, songs _
I said let me put something together.''
   Kapstein, 40, recorded the song, whose title was inspired by rap
stars RUN D.M.C., with a small group of professional musicians. He
hopes to release it as a single for use by other teachers.
   The video, set in a city park, has the ragged feel of a home
movie, but Kapstein said he'd like to make a more polished version
if he can obtain money to cover production costs.
   Economics is just a small part of the middle school curriculum.
But Kapstein believes that if his musical efforts are successful,
students will be more inclined toward the subject when they reach
high school.
   ``Kids in high school really put it off ... it's something that
really has a low priority,'' Kapstein said. ``We try to dispel the
myths, so it's not a terrible monster.
   ``It can ba a lot of fun, economics can be made easy,'' he
added. ``When they get into economics is high school, they're gonna
say, `Yeah.'''
   Kapstein said the seeds of his idea were planted a couple of
years ago when he enrolled in a program at Georgia State
University's Center for Business &amp; Economic Education that stressed
creative and unusual approaches to teaching.
   Mixing music and economics was a natural for him, Kapstein said.
   ``I've always been into motivating the kids through music,''
said Kapstein, who in the 1970s managed the career of the late
blues singer Willie Guy Rainey.
   ``I used to bring in Willie Guy during Black History Month, and
he was the most effective,'' he said.
   Kapstein said he has other ideas, but for now he's waiting to
see if ``RUN G.N.P.'' catches on.
   ``If things take off, I'll be turning out songs like crazy,'' he
said.

   The biggest-ever order for commercial jetliners
extends the comfort margin in an already-hot industry that has
outstripped predictions of success, say analysts and officials for
Boeing Co., which received the biggest share of the blockbuster
order.
   ``We're in the midst of the biggest boom in (aviation)
history,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Multibillion-dollar orders have been rolling in over the past
few years, and even the industry midgets, such as Fokker BV of the
Netherlands and British Aerospace PLC, have years of work booked.
   ``Each succeeding major order is extending by a few weeks the
time during which the companies or the industry will be at peak
production over the next several years,'' Nisbet said.
   On Tuesday, GPA Group Ltd. announced a $17 billion order for 308
airliners _ 121 firm orders and options on an additional 187 jets _
from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Europe's Airbus Industrie.
   The order from the Shannon, Ireland, aircraft-leasing concern is
the largest civilian aircraft order ever, topping Delta Air Lines'
$10.5 billion order for up to 225 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
aircraft last September.
   GPA's order reflects the growing importance of aircraft leasing
companies, which account for about one-fifth of all aircraft
orders. It also underscores the airlines' concern about replacing
their aging fleets.
   Boeing's $9.4 billion share of the order is for 92 737 models,
50 757s and 40 767s, with deliveries over the next seven years.
   At Boeing's rate of production, the orders represent about a
half-year's work. The order fills production slots into the
mid-1990s, said Boeing spokesman T. Craig Martin, and while it
provides security for the work force, it won't require new
employees.
   Even before the order, he said, Boeing had a backlog of more
than 1,100 aircraft, and the industry giant is predicting all
builders will deliver 8,400 new airplanes by 2005 to keep up with
demand.
   ``So while an order like this looks huge, it's really not that
big a percentage of total deliveries,'' Martin said.
   Last year was a record one for Boeing, which received 636 orders
totaling $29 billion. So far this year, 301 orders with a value of
$19.1 billion are on the books of the Seattle company.
   Despite the flood of orders, industry analyst Paul Turk of
Avmark Inc. in Arlington, Va., said that while the industry is in
the clouds it could be brought back to earth in a rush if the world
economy sputters.
   He said Avmark believes Boeing's projections for 8,400 new
airplanes in the next 16 years _ which would more than replace the
existing fleet of some 7,800 planes _ is overly optimistic.
   ``But,'' he added, ``the market is very good and it should be
very good for a while to come.''
   Nisbet said he couldn't argue with Boeing's figures. The
air-carrier industry, from passengers booking flights to
manufacturers and subcontractors, has been flourishing like no one
had predicted, he said.
   The airplane-building business has been growing at an
accelerated rate for several years, Nisbet said, and hit 8 percent
last year.
   ``If you consider 4 percent growth a year as normal ... your
demand for (new) aircraft should be around 300 to 350 a year,'' he
said.
   Last year, he said, there were 512 new deliveries across the
industry, with Boeing providing 289 of those. By 1991, he
estimated, 750 could be delivered.
   Even with an expected leveling off of air travel in the early
1990s, he said, demand for airplanes should remain strong because
replacement aircraft are needed.
   ``For the first time (in industry history) we are in the midst
of a replacement cycle, as well as a growth cycle that is very
strong,'' he said.
   Besides Boeing's share of the GPA order, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
received a $3.1 billion order for 64 MD-80 twin-jets and 8 MD-11
three-jet models, while Airbus Industrie won a $4.3 billion order
for 30 A320s, 10 A330s, and two A340s. In addition, GPA took
options on an additional 10 A330s and two A340s.

   At $17 billion, Tuesday's aircraft order by
Ireland's GPA Group Ltd. for 308 new planes from three
manufacturers became by far the biggest order in aviation history
for commercial jetliners.
   Here is a look at the GPA order and other major orders placed in
the industry, by size:
   _$17 billion by GPA. Boeing Co. received $9.4 billion in firm
orders for 92 Boeing 737 models, 50 757s and 40 767s. All have two
engines. McDonnell Douglas Corp. got firm orders of $3.1 billion
for 64 MD-80 twin-jets and 8 MD-11 three-jet models. Europe's
Airbus Industrie received firm orders of $4.3 billion for 30 A320s,
10 A330s, and two A340s. Also, options for an additional 10 A330s
and two A340s.
   _$10.7 billion order in September 1988 to Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas by Delta Air Lines. The airline ordered nine MD-11 jumbo
jets and nine Boeing 767s, and took options on another 31 MD-11s,
16 767s, 100 MD-88s and 50 Boeing 757s. Value estimated by analysts
since Delta did not divulge dollar amounts.
   _$6 billion order in February 1989 to McDonnell Douglas by
American Airlines, for 50 MD-11 wide-body jetliners, at $4 billion,
and 100 MD-80s, at $2 billion. Only eight orders for MD-11s are
firm. Value estimated by industry analyst, since neither the
manufacturer nor buyer would divulge details.
   _Up to $5.20 billion in orders in March 1989 by American
Airlines for up to 150 Dutch Fokker-100 short-haul planes and 35
Boeing jetliners. American placed firm orders for 75 Fokkers and
options for another 75 in a deal potentially worth $3.09 billion.
The Boeing order is for 25 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft, with
an estimated value of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion.
   _$5.04 billion order in May 1988 to Boeing and Airbus Industrie
by International Lease Finance Corp. Orders were for 78 Boeing
737s, 18 Boeing 767s and four 747 Boeing jumbo jets, plus four
Airbus A300s, six A310s, 18 A320s and two A340s. Options include 19
737s, four 767s and one 747.
   _$4.1 billion order in August 1986 by British Airways PLC for 16
late-model 747s and 12 options.
   _$4.1 billion order in December 1987 by Air France for 16
late-model 747s and 12 options.

   For 1988, Boeing's orders for 640 jetliners represented more
than one-half of all the 1,104 jetliners ordered from major
manufacturers. Others were McDonnell Douglas, 240; Airbus, 161;
British Aerospace, 39, and Fokker, 24.

<HEAD>Firm Says Turboprop Fleet Younger Than Jetliner Fleet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average age of planes in the fleet of
turboprop aircraft used by airlines in North America is 3.1 years
younger than the average for the jetliner fleet, says an aviation
consulting firm.
   The average age of turboprop aircraft used by airlines in the
United States and Canada is 9.3 years, while the average age of jet
aircraft is 12.4 years, according to a study released Tuesday by
Avmark, Inc., which appraises aircraft throughout the world.
   The report prepared for the Regional Airline Association's
International Conference on Aging Commuter Aircraft in Kansas City,
Mo., next week says the average age for the worldwide fleet of
turboprops is 11 years old, compared with more than 13 years for
passenger jets.
   The study, which groups aircraft by regions of the world, says
the North American turboprop fleet is the youngest, while the
Middle East has the oldest aircraft with an average age of 15.4
years. Turboprops in Asia and Australia average 13.5 years, in
Latin America 13 years, in Africa 12.4 years and in Europe 12.1
years, according to the report.
   ``The average age of the commuter-regional turboprop fleet is
expected to experience a decline as the operators continue to
expand their operations through acquisition of a substantial number
of new aircraft in the next decade,'' the report says.
   It says 68.1 percent of the turboprops in North America were
built within the last nine years, while 7.6 percent were built 20
or more years ago. The oldest turboprops are those that carry 40 to
50 passengers, while the youngest are in the 20-39 passenger
category.
   The youngest fleets, according to Avmark, belong to the Midway
Express system, 3.4 years, and Piedmont Commuter, 3.8 years, while
the oldest are operated by Air Canada Connector, 13.2 years, and
Aloha Island, 12.7 years.
   Other fleets in the report and the average age of their
turboprop planes are Delta Connection, 5.6; American Eagle, 5.7;
Northwest Airlink, 6.5; United Express, 6.6; Eastern Express, 7.1;
TWExpress, 7.9; Allegheny Commuter, 8.1; Alaska Commuter, 9.0; Pan
Am Express, 10; Continental Express, 10.8, and Canadian Partner, 11.
   The report covers airplanes in use as of July 1988 and covers
those seating 13 passegners or more that were originally designed
for passenger use although a few are now being used to haul cargo,
Avmark said.

   The number of new single-engine aircraft sold
by U.S. manufacturers increased 28.5 percent in the first quarter,
but sales of all other types of smaller aircraft decreased from the
same period last year, an industry group reported.
   In 1988, the small-aircraft industry reported its first increase
in a decade of both the number and value of planes delivered. The
figures cover sales of civilian planes that carry fewer than 20
passengers and generally are not used by scheduled airlines.
   The first-quarter report released Tuesday by the General
Aviation Manufacturers Association, based on delivery of aircraft,
showed 212 single-engine planes sold, compared with 165 in the
year-ago quarter.
   Sales of jet planes dropped from 34 to 23, while turboprop sales
were down from 52 to 51 and twin-engine aircraft from 23 to 18.
   Sales reached $302.97 million for the first quarter, compared
with $377.46 for the first quarter of 1988, and the value of
aircraft sold abroad dropped to $97.5 million from last year's
$158.52 million for the quarter, the association reported.
   ``The increase in total aircraft deliveries is an encouraging
sign,'' said Edward M. Stimpson, the association's president. But,
he said, the industry has been ``devastated by unfair product
liability laws.'' The association supports bills introduced in
Congress that would limit the liability of manufacturers.
   Stimpson said increased funding to modernize airports is also
needed for the industry to grow.
   The association represents 36 manufacturers of aircraft, engines
and related equipment.

<HEAD>Stocks And Bonds Soar On Inflation Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report that said consumer prices rose the most in
two years during the first quarter of 1989 triggered purchases of
stocks and bonds by investors who had feared the inflation news
would be even worse.
   The Dow Jones 30-stock industrial average gained 41.61 points
Monday to close at 2,379.40, a post-crash high.
   In the credit market, which is especially sensitive to
inflation, purchases of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond drove
its yield down to 8.93 percent from 9.04 percent late Monday. Bond
yields move in the opposite direction of the price.
   Higher food and energy costs boosted consumer prices 0.5 percent
in March, resulting in a 6.1 percent annual inflation rate for the
first three months of 1989, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
   Last month's gain in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
was fresh evidence that inflation continues to run above the 4.4
percent rate registered in both 1987 and 1988.
   ``Inflation was uncomfortably high, widespread and entrenched in
March,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co. ``We
haven't seen the last of these high numbers because there will
still be a rippling through of rising business costs for both
materials and wages and rising energy costs in the next few
months.''
   Still, expectations that the economy is cooling off were
bolstered by a report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday that
showed housing starts fell 5.4 percent in March, with construction
of single-family homes at the slowest pace in more than four years.
   ``The only good news on inflation was the bad news on housing,
underscoring a weak first-quarter economy and raising hope that
later on inflation can recede,'' Sinai said.
   Economist John Hagens of the Wefa Group, a forecasting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the nation appears destined for a round of
``stagflation,'' in which the economy slows while prices continue
to rise, forcing the Federal Reserve to choose between further
restraining growth to curb inflation and boosting the economy to
stimulate employment.
   Food costs in March rose 0.8 percent, twice as fast as in
February.
   Taken together, prices for meat, fish and eggs rose 2.4 percent.
   Energy costs, meanwhile, registered their sharpest increase
since August 1987, advancing 1.1 percent, practically double the
preceding month's 0.6 percent.

<HEAD>Whittle Communications Plans To Publish Ad-Sponsored Books</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications LP wants to put short
hardcover books by respected authors in the briefcases of America's
corporate and civic leaders, and is selling advertising space in
the books to pay the bill.
   The proposal disclosed Tuesday stirred curiosity in the
publishing community, which has generally limited advertising in
hardcover books to pitches for either the author's or the
publisher's other works.
   ``Whether it is a ridiculous idea that will fall on its face or
be the wave of the future, I can't tell yet,'' said Joni Evans, the
publisher of Random House.
   Nansey Neiman, publisher of Warner Books, said she hasn't
decided whether advertising in books would be good for business.
But, she added, ``As a reader, I'm not sure I want to read a book
and find an ad for baby powder, or worse.''
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle said Tuesday it has signed
David Halberstam, John Kenneth Galbraith and seven other well-known
authors for the first of what it says will be several sponsored
book series.
   It would be the first book publishing venture by the
fast-growing media concern, which has specialized in creating
magazines, posters and television programs that sponsors may use to
reach tightly-defined audiences such as new mothers, pet owners or
teens at school.
   Whittle, which is 50 percent-owned by the media giant Time Inc.,
said it plans to publish the first book in what is tentatively
called ``The Larger Agenda'' series later this year. It plans five
books a year.
   The other authors signed by Whittle are George Gilder, Edward J.
Epstein, James Atlas, Robert Waterman, Richard Holbrooke, Daniel
Seligman and William Greider. They are reportedly being paid an
average of $60,000 each.
   Among the topics, Epstein will write about Michael Milken, the
indicted junk bond pioneer; Holbrooke will explain why business
people should care about foreign policy; and Greider will write
about the financial system.
   The books will run about 100 pages, with 20 pages of advertising
scattered among 80 pages of editorial text, and will be sent for
free to about 150,000 people Whittle considers opinion leaders.
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications, said
the project resulted from research that showed many readers failed
to read or finish books because the books were too long and they
had too little time.
   He said writers, meanwhile, wanted an outlet longer than
magazines provide but shorter than full-length books.
   Advertising support provided the financial bridge needed to
support the shorter books, he said.
   Greider, reached in Washington, D.C., said liked getting a
``chance to reach what should be a pretty blue-chip audience'' and
had no problem with the type of advertising he expects would be
included in the series.
   ``If the book was studded with truss ads and hair-restoring ads
and breast implant ads, I could see how you might have some
problems with it,'' he said.
   Whittle plans to sell copies at bookstores nationwide six months
after the free distribution and will sell them more cheaply than
books without ads.
   Whittle officials declined to identify advertisers, but a source
familiar with the plans, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Federal Express Co. of Memphis, Tenn., will be the sole advertiser
in the first series.
   Federal Express spokesman Jim Coleman said that for competitive
reasons, the company does not comment on its advertising plans.
   Carolyn Reidy, president and publisher of Avon Books, said
paperbacks once routinely carried ads two decades ago but the
practice was phased out because of postal regulations and protests
from authors. ``I don't think there will be a rush to do it
again,'' she said.
   Whittle said he hoped to be publishing up to 40 books a year
generating $50 million in annual revenue for his company in five
years. The company had $150 million in revenue last year.

<HEAD>Ramada Agrees To Sell Hotel Group, Change Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEL REISNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc. says it will sell its hotel division
to a Hong Kong firm and give up its 30-year-old trademark of
roadside hospitality as it concentrates on its gambling operations
in a bid to restore profitability.
   Ramada announced an agreement Tuesday to sell its 825-unit hotel
group and the Ramada name to New World Development Co. for $540
million.
   No name has been chosen for the restructured Ramada, said Ramada
spokesman Joe Cole.
   The restructuring was announced last October after Ramada
rejected a takeover bid by the Pritzker family of Chicago, owners
of the Hyatt hotel chain.
   Cole said Phoenix-based Ramada will keep its four casinos _ one
in Atlantic City, N.J., and three in Nevada _ and concentrate on
turning a profit. The company has no immediate expansion plans, he
said.
   Ramada lost $5.1 million last year.
   The hotel group operates under the Ramada Inns, Ramada Hotels,
Rodeway Inns and Renaissance Hotels names.
   Prime Motor Inns of Fairfield, N.J., will pay an undisclosed sum
to New World to operate as franchisor of roughly 600 of the
moderately priced hotels and motels in the United States under the
Ramada and Rodeway names.
   New World, a major real estate company, would be left with about
125 hotels overseas and 15 Renaissance Hotels domestically, Ramada
said.
   Gaming commissions in Nevada and New Jersey, the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and the approximately 31,000 Ramada
stockholders must approve the transaction, Cole said.
   Ramada shareholders will get $7 a share in cash and a
one-quarter share in the new gaming company.
   Cole also announced a preliminary estimate of first-quarter
results showing revenues of $124 million and an operating loss of
$19 million. Ramada had sales of $101.9 million and a $364,000
operating loss in the year-earlier quarter.
   Ramada stock closed at $11.37{, down 75 cents.
   The transaction is a major step in Ramada's restructuring plan,
begun last October, Chairman Richard Snell said.
   ``New World and Prime are making a major commitment to achieve
success for the 800-plus hotels in the Ramada and Rodeway
systems,'' Snell said in a statement. ``The present Ramada Inc.
shareholders will benefit from their investment with cash and a
continuing interest in the new gaming company.''
   Ramada announced March 24 that it had agreed to sell the 152
restaurants in its Marie Callender Pie Shops restaurant unit to a
group of private investors. That sale for undisclosed terms will be
completed by the end of the month, Cole said.
   Cole said the restructuring would be completed within two to
three months.
   Ramada operates the TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort in
Atlantic City, recently refurbished for $200 million and reopened
as the largest casino there.
   The $60 million Ramada Express Hotel Casino opened last June in
Laughlin, Nev. The two other holdings are the Tropicana Resort and
Casino in Las Vegas and Eddie's Fabulous 50's Casino in Reno.
   The new company will employ about 10,000 people, Cole said.
Ramada currently employs about 20,000 _ half in its gaming
operations, 5,600 in the hotel group, and about 3,400 in the
restaurant business.
   Studies last year persuaded Ramada's board of directors that
gaming was the way to profitability.
   Ramada last year received $477 million in revenue from casino
operations and $244 million from hotels and motels. Ramada had
income from continuing operations from casinos of $40 million and
operating income from hotels and motels of $15 million.
   Ramada was started by investors who opened a motel in Flagstaff
in 1954.
   The group's first motels went by the Flamingo or Hiway House
names. When the first franchise was awarded in 1959, the name was
changed to Ramada, a Spanish word meaning ``shady resting place''
and applied to an open, gazebo-like structure offering shade in
treeless areas.

<HEAD>Frequent Flier Who Intervened In Eastern Case Wants Airline Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even if the strike against Eastern Airlines is
never resolved, Moreton Rolleston Jr. figures his pilot son and
flight attendant daughter-in-law eventually will find work. But
he's worried about the effect on competition at Atlanta's airport.
   The 71-year-old Atlanta lawyer said Tuesday he intervened in
Eastern's bankruptcy case because he wants to make sure the idled
airline returns to operation.
   ``This is real important to Atlanta,'' Rolleston said in an
interview. ``Eastern had been running 100,000 people to Atlanta
every day, 290 flights a day. Forty percent of the traffic in
Atlanta was Eastern.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York scheduled a
hearing for next week on Rolleston's motion to have the court to
appoint a trustee to run Eastern until parent Texas Air Corp. can
sell it.
   Rolleston was allowed to intervene in the case because he is a
member of Eastern's frequent flier program, which is run jointly
with sister carrier Continental Airlines. Since he has mileage
credits in the program, which rewards frequent fliers with free
trips, the court considered him an Eastern creditor.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Texas Air's current
position is that Eastern is no longer for sale and instead will be
trimmed to a smaller size and remain in operation as part of its
bankruptcy reorganization.
   She said Rolleston ``is the father of a striking Eastern pilot
and the father-in-law of a striking Eastern flight attendant, so
his interests are more than those of a frequent traveler.''
   ``I'm not a stockholder. I have no financial connection with
Eastern. I have not sought out anybody to buy it. I have no strings
attached, although I do have a personal interest,'' he said.
   ``My son is a captain with Eastern; he's been with Eastern for
22 years, and my daughter-in-law is a flight attendant,'' Rolleston
said. ``I'm not going to give you his name because my family is not
part of this. What I did, I did as a lawyer and I did it before any
of them knew about it.''
   Since Eastern went on strike, he said, ``you can't get out of
Atlanta unless you're on Delta'' Air Lines, which is based in
Atlanta.
   And Delta's flights are so crowded since the Eastern strike,
it's cramping his traveling style. Used to having a choice of
flight times, Rolleston complained that, to go to a bankruptcy
court hearing on Eastern on Monday, ``I could only get one flight
out to New York Sunday.''
   Eastern workers have been on strike since March 4, contending
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo has damaged the airline and
plotted to destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to
Continental.
   Lorenzo put Eastern into bankruptcy court refuge March 9 and has
been seeking a buyer. Ex-baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth
nearly completed a $464 million deal to buy Eastern. But the sale
fell through over a dispute between the unions and Lorenzo over who
would run the airlines until Ueberroth's investor group could
assume control.
   ``Regardless of whether you agree with them or not _ and I'm not
going to take a position on that _ the employees are not going to
go back to work as long as Lorenzo controls Eastern,'' Rolleston
said. ``If you had a trustee, the employees would go back to work.''
   Rolleston said his son isn't angry that his father jumped into
the fray.
   ``He went to New York with me (for a hearing earlier this week),
but he's not in the lawsuit, and he doesn't want to get involved in
the legal end of it,'' Rolleston said.
   Rolleston said his family's involvement in the company isn't the
reason he's trying to get Eastern back into operation anyway.
   ``This is real important to this city,'' he said. ``The fact
that it'll help my son and daughter-in-law is fine, but they'll be
back flying one of these days anyway. I want Eastern Airlines
flying here in Atlanta.''

   Analysts say billionaire oilman Marvin Davis
has obtained financing that will support a bid of more than $100 a
share for NWA Inc., a belief reflected by the sharp climb in the
stock price of the parent of Northwest Airlines.
   NWA's stock closed Tuesday at $97.38, up $7.13. It was the most
active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with 3.5 million
shares trading hands.
   ``This should flush out any competing bids and probably a higher
bid from Davis,'' said Louis Marckesano, an analyst for Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia.
   Davis has said he would consider increasing his bid of $2.7
billion, or $90 a share, but did not offer a higher price Tuesday.
NWA's board has rejected his current bid as inadequate and on
Monday directed management to explore a wide range of possible
deals to maximize shareholder value.
   Marckesano said the board's announcement may have played the
biggest role in making the stock jump. But part of the momentum
came from the realization that Davis' $3.3 billion financial
package could support a bid of up to $110 a share, said Kurt Rivard
of Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth Inc.
   ``It's a very strong financing package,'' said Sandy Schuele,
who operates a small hedge fund in Plainfield, N.H. ``If there is
anyone else in the wings, they would have to surface now. If they
don't surface, there is no one else in the wings.''
   The package would include $300 million of Davis' own money, a
$600 million bond offering and a $500 million loan from Citibank.
The balance would be a loan arranged by Citicorp North America Inc.
from a syndicate of major banks, Davis said.
   In addition, Citibank would provide a $250 million backup
revolving line of credit to be available to supplement NWA's
working capital, Davis said.
   ``Citibank wouldn't undertake this unless they felt their client
had a serious purpose,'' Schuele said.
   In state government circles, where officials have expressed fear
that Davis would break up the Eagan-based airline to pay takeover
debt, there was some criticism of the financial package.
   Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch said the package
would require annual debt payments of up to $450 million, depending
on the interest rates.
   ``The company had a profit last year of $135 million,'' Hatch
said. ``Where does he get the other $300 million? What he presented
today doesn't give that answer and very frankly that's the
question.''
   Hatch has supported efforts in the Minnesota Legislature to pass
laws that would discourage a takeover of Northwest, which employs
more than 15,000 people in the state. Gov. Rudy Perpich said
actions are still being pursued on the state and federal levels to
thwart a takeover even though he believes Davis is determined to
buy Northwest.
   Davis repeated Tuesday that he would not have to sell
``strategic'' assets or cut employment to finance the takeover.
   Mark Daugherty, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. of New
York, said Davis would have second thoughts about not selling
strategic assets if a recession develops. He said the debt load of
Davis' plan would be ``burdensome'' on the airline.
   NWA has said it will provide non-public information to Davis and
other ``qualified third parties'' interested in buying the company.
Management has received approval to negotiate with Davis, but
neither the company nor a Davis spokesman in New York would say
whether the two sides had made contact.
   NWA's board also said it would explore restructuring moves
including the acquisition of another company, a partial or complete
liquidation of the airline, a repurchase of shares, a special
dividend to shareholders, or a sale of equity to third parties.
   William Genoese, who heads the airline division of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on Friday said Northwest
might be considering buying financially troubled Pan American World
Airways. The company would not comment on the rumor.

<HEAD>Judge Continues Injunction Against Prime Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to lift an injunction
against MAI Basic Four Inc.'s $970 million hostile bid for Prime
Computer Inc.
   U.S. District Court Judge A. David Mazzone said Tuesday he would
not remove the injunction until MAI, a Tustin, Calif., computer
firm, provides Prime stockholders with audited year-end financial
statements from MAI's investment bank, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The ruling will further delay MAI's $20-per-share tender offer
for Prime, a Natick-based computer maker with revenue of $1.59
billion last year. The tender offer has been enjoined since Dec. 9
when Mazzone ruled that Drexel's involvement in the takeover battle
was so extensive that the bank should be considered a co-bidder and
had to disclose financial information.
   ``We are very gratified that Judge Mazzone has ordered MAI and
Drexel to make the disclosures we have been seeking for five
months,'' said Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan.
   MAI also is waging a proxy battle for control of Prime's board
of directors at the company's June 14 annual meeting. Prime
Chairman David J. Dunn said the current board is committed to
selling the company but considers MAI's offer too low.
   MAI filed financial disclosure documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission April 6 in an effort to satisfy Mazzone and
remove the injunction.
   In his ruling Tuesday, the judge said most of those documents,
including a list of Drexel's trades in Prime stock, were adequate.
But he said Drexel's statement of financial condition, which was
for the first nine months of 1988, was not current enough.
   Mazzone said he would not lift the injunction until 10 days
after MAI certifies that it has mailed Drexel's year-end statement
to Prime stockholders.
   At the same time, the judge denied a motion from Prime to place
another injunction on the offer because of alleged violations of
Federal Reserve margin requirements.

   The French oil and chemical company that
agreed to take over Pennwalt Corp. last month has extended its
tender offer three weeks, officials announced.
   Officials for Elf Aquitane's subsidiary AC Development Inc. said
Tuesday the offer of $132 per share for the pharaceutical company's
stock will expire May 19 instead April 21.
   The company needs the additional time to comply with the Federal
Trade Commission's request for information and documents involving
the proposed takeover, Elf Aquitane spokesman Earl Huntington said.
   As of noon Tuesday, more than 1,565,000 shares of Pennwalt had
been tendered, according to Huntington. The French company
announced its plans to purchase all of Pennwalt's 8 million
outstanding shares March 20.
   The agreement prevented a hostile takeover by Centaur Partners,
a New York investment group headed by Abbey J. Butler amd Melvyn J.
Estrin.
   Pennwalt board members spurned Centaur's $110-per-share offer,
calling it inadequate and the partners unworthy. Centaur dropped
its takeover bid with the Elf Aquitane offer.
   Pennwalt stock closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$129.12{, down 12{ cents.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were
higher at midday Wednesday, but were slipping from the day's best
levels as the market's early rally ran out of steam.
   Shares advanced from the opening on the back of a strong
performance Tuesday in New York, where reassuring inflation news
and computerized program trading propelled the Dow Jones industrial
average to 2,379.40, a gain of 41.61 points, and its highest level
since the October 1987 crash.
   ``The buying appears to have dried up,'' said one British equity
salesman.
   Another London dealer said the market rose ``a bit too quickly
which killed off a lot of trade.''
   At about 12:15 p.m. in London, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was 8.2 points, or 0.4 percent, higher at
2,082.6, near its morning low of 2,081.4. Its best level was
2,096.8.
   Volume amounted to a moderately healthy 435.3 million shares by
midday, compared with 272.9 million shares Tuesday.

<HEAD>EEC Plans To Clear Plessey Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission plans to clear the
$3 billion takeover bid for Britain's defense-electronics company,
Plessey, by Siemens of West Germany and General Electric Co. of
Britain, it was announced Wednesday.
   If the provisional decision by the European Economic Community
is confirmed, it could clear the way for the creation of a new
electronics giant in Europe.
   In a statement, the EEC's competition commissioner Sir Leon
Brittan said the commission ``had come to the conclusion that the
proposed arrangements do not raise objections under the EEC's
competition rules.''
   Brittan stressed, however, that all parties concerned and the
public would be invited to comment before a final decision was made.
   He said that Plessey would have six weeks to respond to the
commission. Then, according to what the company says in its
response, the commission would either confirm its decision or look
at the case again.
   The EEC's opinion was issued prior to the publication in Britain
of a review of the bid by the British Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
   Brittan said his proposed clearance of the bid excluded
Plessey's defense interests because EEC rules allow member states
to take unilateral measures necessary to protect these interests.
   He said that General Electric Co. (GEC) and Siemens had pledged
to maintain Plessey's semi-conductor activities as a distinct
company under Plessey management and to support related research
and development.
   The commission said that GEC and Siemens agreed not to make any
``substantial modifications'' in those activities without obtaining
the approval of the EEC.
   EEC antitrust officials launched the probe into the bid for
Plessey after the company asked the commission last December to
block the bid under the EEC's competition rules. These rules outlaw
any industrial agreement likely to distort free competition.
   GEC and Plessey are Britain's two largest defense-electronics
contractors. Siemens, with NV Philips of the Netherlands, is one of
Europe's two top electronics groups.

   Stung by bad publicity from the government's
massive securities fraud probes and slumping business since the
1987 stock market crash, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is shedding
its 2,300-employee retail brokerage unit as part of a major
restructuring.
   The nation's fifth-largest investment firm said Tuesday it will
try to sell the brokerage unit, which accounts for about 10 percent
of Drexel's business, to another brokerage house.
   Drexel said it also is abandoning its business in municipal
securities, over-the-counter stocks, and research and transactions
in non-U.S. securities. The restructuring will cut Drexel's work
force by about a third.
   The move comes five days after Drexel agreed to tight federal
oversight for three years in settling civil fraud charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph announced the
restructuring over the firm's public address system, calling the
verdict by its board of directors last weekend ``the only
economically viable solution.''
   He said the move was made to so Drexel could deal with the
``current realities'' at the firm, implying the government's nearly
three-year investigation of alleged securities abuses, many
involving the Milken's dealings with jailed inside trader Ivan
Boesky.
   ``The decision was made in view of the anticipated inability to
grow the retail business to an economically viable size in light of
ongoing adverse publicity ...,'' Drexel said in a statement.
   The SEC pact clears the way for settlement of criminal fraud
charges with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Drexel has
agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650
million to avoid a massive racketeering indictment.
   A rash of civil lawsuits over Drexel's activities, possibly
numbering in the thousands, now are expected to be filed in
individual states. In addition, congressional officials have
indicated they plan further investigations into Drexel.
   The continued investigations, along with the possible
high-visibility trial of former Drexel junk-bond financier Michael
Milken, means the firm will remain in a negative spotlight for some
time.
   ``It's a kind of situation that's very sensitive as far as
retail clients are concerned,'' said PaineWebber Inc. analyst
Brenda Davis McCoy.
   In its statement, Drexel cited ``the depressed state of the
securities industry, the anticipated lack of participation by
individual investors'' and increased competition from commercial
banks in retail brokerage.
   Drexel, which does not release earnings or other detailed
financial data, said it has total capital of about $2 billion and
net equity capital of about half that.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to give details on the
extent of the retail business decline, but said: ``It was just
getting difficult. Indeed, the numbers were going in the other
direction.''
   After a board meeting Tuesday, Drexel said it notified about 10
other Wall Street firms about peddling the division. It said it
hopes to have bids by Saturday and a sale completed by early next
week.
   Drexel's statement said the firm would concentrate on high-yield
junk bonds, government securities, corporate finance, institutional
fixed income activities, mortgage-backed securities, arbitrage and
commodities.
   Business on Wall Street has been sluggish because of high
interest rates, continued investor distrust following the October
1987 market crash, and a severe decline in mergers and
acquisitions. Several firms announced weak first-quarter profits in
the last week.
   Drexel itself has shrunk from a high of about 10,000 employees
worldwide to 9,100 today. The 10 percent payroll decline is about
average for Wall Street firms, most of which laid off hundreds of
employees after the crash.
   The retail brokerage unit has lost about 200 brokers from a high
of 1,300. It now has about 1,100 brokers and another 1,200
employees. Drexel declined to say how many people would be laid off
in the restructuring.
   ``Individuals prefer money market instruments, savings accounts
to speculation or even investments,'' said James Hanbury of
Wertheim Schroder Inc. ``It's cyclical. We're in a down cycle.''
   Joseph named Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and
PaineWebber as possible buyers. Shearson spokesman Steve Fagan said
his firm is not interested in the unit.
   Because of the planned personnel reduction, Drexel also said it
had informed the city of New York that it was scrapping plans to
build new Manhattan offices.

<HEAD>OPEC To Push Up Output If Oil Price Goes Above $19</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would try to cap oil prices by raising their production
if the cartel's oil basket price went beyond $19 a barrel, OPEC
sources said Wednesday.
   They said that such an understanding was reached at the group's
last full ministerial meeting in November.
   Representatives from OPEC's 13 member countries agreed at that
gathering to limit output to 18.5 million barrels a day to achieve
a target price of $18 a barrel. Their current production is
estimated at 19.6 million barrels a day.
   The sources said that if the $19-price trigger was pulled, the
market would see increased oil output from member countries, many
of whom are operating at well below their potential production
capacity.
   The OPEC oil basket price was at $18.49 a barrel at midday
Wednesday, compared with $18.25 a barrel a week ago.
   The basket is calculated as a running seven-day average of the
spot, or non-contact, prices of seven crude oils.
   The sources were responding to questions about what OPEC's
response would be to the shutdown of the entire North Sea Brent
production and delivery system following an accident late Tuesday.
   The gas leak and explosion on Shell U.K. Exploration and
Production's Cormorant Alpha platform reduced North Sea oil output
by 472,000 barrels a day, or by one-quarter of the British sector's
total output. There were no injuries.
   The accident pushed up oil prices sharply. The spot price of
Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was
trading at $21.50 a barrel in London late Wednesday morning, up
from $20.05 late Tuesday.
   An OPEC spokesman at the group's Secretariat in Vienna declined
to comment.
   OPEC's members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, Algeria,
Nigeria, Gabon, Indonesia, Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Libya, and Ecuador.

   Stock prices were mixed today as traders cashed
in on some of the recent gains that have carried the market to its
highest levels since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.20 to 2,381.60 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 380 up, 580

   However, brokers say, signs of a slowing economy also raise some

<HEAD>Oil Futures Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices surged in early trading today
as concern spread that a North Sea oil explosion could disrupt
petroleum deliveries.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, had jumped
$1.21 a barrel to $22.72 at about 11 a.m. EDT. The contract closed
at $21.51 on Tuesday.
   ``Details are still vague but there's a possibility that some
companies aren't able to deliver on cargos due a week from today,''
said Ed Ryan, energy broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``This
is impacting the market in a very big way.''
   The explosion and fire on the small oil Cormorant Alpha platform
owned by Shell U.K. Exploration and Production on Tuesday shut down
the North Sea Brent oil field, interrupting production of nearly
500,000 barrels a day of oil, officials said today.
   ``The Cormorant is a gathering station. The Brent crude must
flow through this one smaller station,'' said Bob Baker, oil
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Shell officials were expected to examine the damage today and
decide how long the pipelines would remain closed, analysts said.
   Energy brokers said the timing of the event, following the
Alaskan oil spill, could drive prices significantly higher.
   The spill off the Alaskan coast on March 24 closed down oil
shipping lanes and disrupted the flow of oil to refineries in the
United States for several days. Since then, prices of both crude
and refined products have risen by more than 10 cents.
   Crude prices have risen nearly 80 percent since last October
when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to
reduce oil production.
   In addition, problems with other North Sea oil facilities and
lower production by the United States have helped push prices
higher.

   Senate backers of a plan to rescue the savings
and loan industry today defeated an attempt to force the nation's
top S&amp;L regulator to face reconfirmation, but they struggled to
overcome a dispute that could delay adoption of the bailout package.
   The Senate voted 61-38 to block an amendment offered by Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., that would require President Bush to renominate M.
Danny Wall as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the
Senate to vote on the appointment.
   The administration wants to guarantee Wall the right to serve
out his term through June 1991.
   However, Graham complained that Wall's reassuring comments about
the health of S&amp;Ls, as late as a month before last November's
presidential election, ``amounted to ``an intravenous shot of
morphine that would have numbed anyone to the crisis.''
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, offered a warm personal defense of Wall,
who worked for him for 17 years, dating back to Garn's days as
mayor of Salt Lake City.
   He praised Wall's honesty and integrity, adding, ``Let's do an
FBI report on this man. It'll be so dull, so boring that nobody
would want to read it.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, an opponent of the
package, threatened to prolong debate unless the Senate adopts a
half-dozen amendments, including several pro-consumer measures.
   ``If you're going to cost the consumers of this country ... the
least you can do is make them feel good about it and give them a
little something,'' he said.
   The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Garn, the panel's senior Republican, have
so far defeated attempts to amend the bill in the full Senate. All
21 members of the committee have endorsed the bill.
   The legislation basically tracks the proposal presented in
February by Bush, pledging $157 billion to the problem over the
next 10 years and providing a host of reforms, chief among them a
requirement that S&amp;L owners back their lending with more of their
own capital.
   On a 50-48 vote _ 12 short of the 60-vote majority required _
the Senate on Tuesday rejected an effort by Graham to add $50
billion of the plan's cost to the fiscal 1989 budget. That move
could have stuck Bush with the biggest federal deficit in history.
   Earlier, senators voted 66-32 to beat an amendment that would
have weakened the administration's control over disposal of an
estimated $400 billion in real estate owned by failed S&amp;Ls.
   Objections by Metzenbaum threatened to spoil Senate leaders'
plans to pass the bill today and leave for an 11-day recess.
   Metzenbaum has not specified what he wants. However, he said
possibilities include requiring banks and S&amp;Ls to offer cheap
checking accounts for poor people and free cashing of government
checks.
   He also wants financial institutions to disclose their
performance in serving minorities and he wants the government to
reopen last year's S&amp;L rescues.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he would
recess the Senate on Thursday to observe the first day of Passover,
then, if Metzenbaum desired, return on Friday and keep senators
working into the weekend.
   However, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said supporters of the bill
would file a motion today seeking to force a vote on final passage
by Friday.
   The House version of S&amp;L legislation passed a Banking
subcommittee this week. It is scheduled for consideration by the
full committee next week and by the full House by the end of May.
Following a House-Senate conference, that could put the bill on
Bush's desk in June, four months after he announced his plan.
   On the funding mechanism, six Democratic senators joined 44
Republicans in support of the administration plan, which was
opposed by 47 Democrats and one Republican.
   Graham had argued that financing the S&amp;L bailout through regular
Treasury borrowings would be $4.5 billion cheaper than the
administration's plan to borrow the money through a quasi-public
agency and keep $50 billion out of the budget deficit.
   However, Graham's plan could have ballooned the 1989 budget
deficit within range of the all-time high of $221 billion, set in
1986.
   An amendment by Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., would have loosened
administration control of the S&amp;L bailout agency. Bush wanted the
Treasury secretary, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the
attorney general to run the agency. The Senate bill adds two
outside members to the board, but Kerrey would have added four
outside members, enough to outvote the government officials.
   Democrats opposing Graham on the funding plan were Sens. Joseph
Biden of Delaware, Alan Cranston of California, Alan Dixon of
Illinois, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, Jay Rockefeller of West
Virginia and Jim Sasser of Tennessee. Only one Republican, Larry
Pressler of South Dakota, supported Graham. Sens. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., and Albert Gore, D-Tenn., did not vote.

<HEAD>Soybeans Gain On Brazilian Dock Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean prices for near-term delivery rose
strongly this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade on perceptions
that a 9-day-old Brazilian dockworkers strike is disrupting exports
of Brazilian soybeans.
   Grain futures were modestly higher in early trading, but gains
in most markets were being held in check by prospects for rain in
the Midwest later this week.
   No substantial progress was reported at a formal mediation
session Tuesday in efforts to end the nationwide dockworkers strike
in Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean producer after the
United States.
   Weather forecasts continue to exert a strong influence on the
markets, where memories of last summer's drought linger. Many
private forecasters are still predicting dry weather in the Corn
Belt all the way into next week but some see an increasing
likelihood of showers in the region later this week.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.13 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1 cent higher with May at $2.76{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to
2} cents higher with May at $2.01 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
lower to 7{ cents higher with May at $7.56 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were modestly lower in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .18 cent to .57 cent lower with June at 70.95
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .55 cent lower with
May at 75.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to .25 cent
lower with June at 46.42 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.50 cent to .72 cent lower with May at 32.70 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Shearson Reports $15 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Wednesday it
lost $15 million in the first quarter, attributing the $90 million
decline from last year to sluggish Wall Street business activity
and higher interest rates.
   Shearson is the fifth investment firm to report a loss or lower
earnings in the last week. In addition, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
said Wednesday it is selling its retail brokerage unit, in part
because of a business decline.
   Shearson said the loss for the quarter compared with a $75
million profit, or 75 cents a share, in the same 1988 period.
   The firm said the decline reflects a $35.2 million pre-tax
write-down of MCorp securities held by the firm, lower investment
banking revenue and lower net interest income.
   The decline came despite an increase in revenue to $3 billion
from $2.5 billion a year ago.
   ``The disappointing results for the quarter reflect the
continuing low level of investor participation in the financial
markets and the impact of higher interest rates,'' Shearson
Chairman Peter A. Coehn said in a statement.
   Shearson said it is continuing ``cost control efforts''
including an agreement to sell a shareholder services group and
negotiations to sell an asset management subsidiary.
   Shearson said investment banking revenue for the quarter totaled
$243 million, a 31.9 perent drop from $357 million a year ago. The
firm said the decline reflects ``the industry-wide slowdown in
underwriting merger and acquisition activity.''
   Commission revenues increased 9.5 percent to $436 million from
$398 million a year ago. Revenues from market-making and principal
transactions fell 9.6 percent to $319 million from $353 million in
the 1988 quarter.
   The firm also showed a 71.2 percent drop in net interest income,
to $19 million from $66 million a year ago, blaming a rise in
short-term rates that have often outpaced long-term ones.
   American Express Co. owns a controlling stake in Shearson.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were mostly lower in early trading
today, as the market took back some of Tuesday's strong gains amid
sharply rising oil prices.
   The U.S. Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue was down about 7-32
point, or about $2 for every $1,000 in face amount before noon EDT.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose
to 8.95 from 8.93 late Tuesday.
   The market opened lower today after a surge in bond prices on
Tuesday following two economic reports that provided further
evidence that the economy is slowing. The reports on consumer
prices and housing starts suggested that the Federal Reserve's
policy of pushing interest rates higher has moderated economic
growth and helped ease inflationary pressures.
   The government reported that consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent
in March, or about what the market expected, while housing starts
fell 5.4 percent last month.
   Analysts said the market pulled back slightly this morning
partly on profit-taking and amid surging crude oil prices stemming
from an oil and gas explosion in the North Sea.
   ``Higher oil prices means higher inflation,'' said Peter
Greenbaum, energy analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, such as
notes and bonds.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues were unchanged to 3-32 point lower,
intermediate maturities were down between [ point and 5-32 point
and long-term issues were down as much as 7-32 point, according to
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 1.54 to 1,131.29.
   In corporate trading, industrials edged up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures the total return on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up
0.26 to 302.86.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down to 8.73 percent
as the discount fell 3 basis points to 8.46 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 8.88 percent as the discount lost 3 basis
points to 8.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills, meanwhile, rose
to 9.17 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to 8.48 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9}, up from 9{ percent late Tuesday.

   Stock prices pushed ahead today, getting a
little more mileage out of the rally that has carried the market to
its highest levels since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 41.61 points on

<HEAD>Texas Eastern Post First Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp., a natural gas and petroleum
products pipeline company that has been pursued by two companies,
said today earnings for the first quarter of 1989 improved by 97
percent partly because of an $11.6 million settlement in a pipeline
project.
   For the first three months of this year, the Houston-based
company posted earnings of $57.5 million, or $1.02 per share, on
operating revenue of $1 billion, compared to $29.2 million, or 55
cents per share, on revenue of $898 million for the same period in
1988.
   Included in the profits were $11.6 million in non-recurring
gains primarily due to settlement of anti-trust litigation
associated with the ETSI coal slurry pipeline project, in which
Texas Eastern was a partner.
   Excluding $29.2 milion in non-recurring net charges relating to
events which led to the pending merger of Texas Eastern and
Houston-based Panhandle Eastern Corp., the company had net earnings
of $86.7 million for the three month period ending March 31.
   ``We are pleased with the company's first period performance. It
reflects the results of the extensive restructuring program
undertaken during the past two years; the company has posted four
consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvements in net earnings,'' said
Dennis R. Hendrix, president of Texas Eastern.
   ``The asset disposition program and efficiencies achieved
through decentralization and staff reductions have returned the
company's earnings to levels attained during the early 1980s when
the company benefitted from much higher crude oil prices,'' he said.
   The battle for Texas Eastern between Panhandle Eastern and
Houston-based Coastal Corp. began Jan. 16 when Coastal announced
its surprise $2.6 billion takeover bid. But the Texas Eastern board
rejected the offer as too low, signing the merger agreement with
Panhandle Eastern on Feb. 21.
   Panhandle Eastern's $3.2 billion offer includes provisions to
buy up to 80 percent of Texas Eastern's 60.8 million outstanding
shares and a stock exchange at the same $53-a-share value for the
remaining shares.
   The combination of the two companies would create a 27,000-mile
system and result in one of the nation's largest pipeline companies
in terms of miles.
   Earlier this week, Coastal extended its tender offer until March
31, while Panhandle Eastern extended their offer to April 26.

<HEAD>Merc Announces Recommendations of Panel in Wake of Federal Probe</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with announcement of recommendations. Adds byline.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago Mercantile Exchange panel today
recommended restrictions on most forms of ``dual trading,'' the
doubling of its surveillance staff and improved auditing in
response to a federal fraud investigation.
   ``Some of these proposals were under study prior to the FBI
investigation. But the failure to respond quickly would have shown
a lack of leadership,'' said John Geldermann, chairman of the
Merc's Special Committee to Review Trading Practices.
   Geldermann also is chairman of the Merc's Board of Governors, to
whom the recommendations are submitted for a decision expected
within 60 days.
   Dual trading enables a trader on the exchange to deal for his
own account as well as customers' accounts. While the practice is
legal, many consider it a problem because it allows traders to
allocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dump losing
trades on customers.
   Proponents argue that dual trading increases liquidity because
traders can continue doing business when they don't have outside
orders.
   But the Merc committee, recognizing the public perception that
the practice trading invites abuse, recommended dual trading be
banned from futures contracts in cases where market volume is great
enough to ensure liquidity.
   The panel also recommended the Merc's fulltime floor
surveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members and
said the exchange's disciplinary committees should include a person
who is not a Merc member.
   ``It's hardly cynical to say that they're hoping to act in
advance of the government,'' Daniel Siegel, a professor at
Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Business, said
in an interview a day before the recommendations were formally
released.
   ``Frankly, I suspect the leadership at the Merc is upset by some
of the revelations coming out of the probe. Remember also that the
futures industry has prospered with self-regulation and they would
like to keep control,'' Siegel added.
   The nine-member committee was appointed in late January,
following disclosure the federal government was investigating
allegations that as many as 100 brokers at the Merc and the Chicago
Board of Trade systematically cheated investors out of millions of
dollars through illegal trading practices.
   Although as many as 200 subpeonas reportedly have been issued to
traders and firms at the world's two largest futures exchanges, no
indictments have been issued thus far.
   Among the members of the Merc committee are Leo Melamed,
chairman of the executive committee of the Merc and special counsel
to the exchange's Board of Governors; and Susan Phillips, who
formerly headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
federal agency that regulates the industry.
   Shortly after it was assembled, the committee asked Robert
Wilmouth, president of the National Futures Association, to assist
in its review of trading practices. The NFA is the industry's chief
watchdog organization.
   The exchanges have successfully fought off repeated attempts for
increased regulation in the past, most recently after the 1987
stock market crash. At the time, some critics blamed the futures
exchanges for market volatility that may have worsened the crash.
   But the exchanges, in a successful effort to forestall more
government intervention, argued that futures selling actually
provided an outlet that prevented the crash from getting worse.

<TEXT>
   Allied Signal Inc. announced
Wednesday a 12.5 percent increase in first-quarter earnings,
attributing the rise, in part, to improved performance by its
aerospace unit.
   The advanced technology company reported net income for the
quarter of $126 million, or 85 cents per share, up from $112
million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue was flat at $2.9 billion.
   ``We have been concentrating on lowering our costs and improving
our current earnings,'' said Edward L. Hennessy Jr., chairman and
chief executive officer of Allied Signal.
   ``Our results for the quarter are on target, and we expect
earnings to continue strong for the rest of the year,'' Hennessy
said in a news release.
   Net income for the first quarter of 1989 from the company's
aerospace business rose 58 percent on a 7 percent increase in
sales, Allied Signal said.
   In addition to its aerospace business, Allied Signal
manufactures automotive products such as anti-lock brake systems
and airbags.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Firmer On Rising Oil Prices, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: An AMer expected by 5:30 p.m. EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed higher on Wednesday against
most of the major currencies in European trading, boosted by rising
oil prices. Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said higher oil prices and portfolio
adjustments by dealers after the dollar's decline on Tuesday lifted
the dollar.
   They said oil price rise encouraged speculation that the Federal
Reserve would be more likely than the central banks in West Germany
and Japan to encourage higher interest rates in response to
inflationary pressures.
   However, one dealer in Frankfurt said he didn't expect to see
the dollar much stronger because recent government reports have
indicated weakness in the U.S. economy, a development that would
discourage credit-tightening by the Fed.
   The benchmark price of oil from the British North Sea's Brent
field was marked up WEdnesday by $1.48 to $21.13 a barrel for
delivery next month, after news that the entire field had been shut
down by a platform gas explosion. The field produces nearly
one-quarter of the British sector's ouput of around 2 million
barrels daily.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7113 late Wednesday from
$1.7185 late Tuesday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.8615 West German marks, up from
1.8528; 1.6360 Swiss francs, up from 1.6283; 6.3025 French francs,
up from 6.2750; 2.0985 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0935; 1,363.75
Italian lire, down from 1,366.95; and 1.1865 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1848.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 131.88 Japanese yen, down
from 132.10 yen late Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar traded at
132.10 yen.
   In the bullion markets, gold traded at a bid of $383.95 a troy
ounce in London, up from $383.25 late Tuesday. But the late bid
price for gold fell to $383.50 an ounce in Zurich from $384.00 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.25 an ounce, down from
$386.68 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.79 a troy
ounce, up from $5.78 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Bristol-Myers, Other Pharmaceutical Concerns, Post Healthy Profit
Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristol-Myers Co., maker of many widely known brands including
Bufferin and Excedrin pain relievers and Clairol hair care
products, Wednesday reported its first-quarter profit rose 12.6
percent to a record level.
   Two other companies in the pharmaceutical business _ Squibb
Corp. and Schering-Plough Corp. _ also posted healthy earnings for
the quarter.
   Bristol-Myers said after-tax earnings amounted to $237 million,
or 82 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, up from
$210.6 million, or 73 cents a share, in 1988's first quarter.
   Sales for the quarter were the highest in the company's history,
rising just over 5 percent to $1.60 billion from $1.52 billion.
International sales gained 11 percent while domestic sales were up
3 percent.
   Bristol-Myers, based in New York, has operations in
non-prescription and prescription drugs, toiletries and household
products, such as Windex and Drano. It did not provide any specific
information about the financial performance of its individual
operations.
   Industry analysts have said Bristol-Myers has been a leader in
manufacturing anti-cancer drugs and has benefited from the
popularity of its anti-anxiety agent, BuSpar.
   Squibb said its first-quarter earnings rose 17.2 percent to
$106.5 million, or $1.09 a share, from $90.9 million, or 89 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales increased 11 percent to $662.7 million
from $596.9 million.
   The Princeton, N.J.-based company's chairman and chief executive
officer, Richard M. Furland, said the balance sheet improvements
reflected excellent performances by Squibb's leading products,
better gross margins and a slight leverage on operating expenses.
   These positive factors more than compensated for a 23 percent
rise in research and development costs and flat sales growth in
traditional products.
   Schering-Plough said its net income rose 23.8 percent in the
first quarter to $125.7 million, or $1.12 a share, from $101.5
million, or 91 cents a share, the year before.
   Sales increased 10.5 percent to $831.8 million from $752.5
million. Schering-Plough, based in Madison, N.J., attributed the
overall growth mainly to sales in its pharmaceutical businesses,
which expanded 14 percent.
   Sales of Schering-Plough's consumer products, such as Coppertone
sun protection products and Dr. Scholl's foot care line, rose more
modestly.
   Among the products pacing the increase in pharmaceutical sales
were items to treat asthma, cardiovascular problems and
dermatological disorders, Schering-Plough said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices closed with steep
losses Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade following midday
forecasts for an increased chance of rain in the western Corn Belt
later this week.
   But wheat futures advanced on persistent talk of hot, dry
weather in Kansas and on news that Egypt is seeking to buy 300,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   ``Welcome to the weather market,'' said Ted Mao, a grain
specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, referring
to the recent volatility in the grain markets.
   Some private meteorologists who had been predicting dry weather
for the rest of this week in Iowa and northwestern Illinois
forecast rain in their noon forecasts on Wednesday, prompting heavy
selling of corn and soybean contracts.
   The markets are unusually sensitive to weather forecasts because
last year's drought lowered U.S. grain stockpiles. Another drought
year could drain stocks down to critical levels.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 4} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.11} a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 4{ cents lower with May at $2.73 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to
3{ cents lower with May at $1.97 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents

<TEXT>
   Michael Dell _ 24-year-old college-dropout
whiz kid multimillionaire who made his fortune cloning computers _
has a problem, he says. Wall Street doesn't understand his
5-year-old company.
   Financial analysts aren't sure Michael Dell understands business.
   Dell Computer Corp. wowed Wall Street by taking a company from
startup to $257.8 million in annual sales and $14.4 million in
profit by selling copies of the popular International Business
Machines personal computers.
   Dell carted three computers off to the University of Texas in
1984, promptly sold them at a profit and began making clones in his
condominium near the campus. Soon he was earning up to $80,000 a
month and figured computers, not classrooms, were where he should
direct his attention.
   Not bad for a pre-med major who began tinkering with computers
in high school and used to hang out at the local Radio Shack store
in Houston begging his orthodontist father for a PC.
   Success in the muddled IBM clone market brought Dell much
favorable publicity in financial and trade publications. He was
labeled an ``innovation upstart,'' ``computer industry's latest
whiz kid'' and ``entrepreneur in short pants.''
   But Dell's gimmick was marketing, not technology. He bypassed
retailers, going directly to consumers through advertisements in
user magazines and selling his wares over the phone from Austin.
   Then last year, Dell ran into a $104 million inventory buildup
and the bitter departure of a senior vice president.
   The buildup knocked revenue and sales predictions askew. Even
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., one of the investment firms that helped with
last year's initial public offering, now is telling customers to
buy another computer stock instead.
   After an initial price of $8.50 per share, the stock climbed to
$13, but fell to $6 after the problems became apparent. It
currently is hanging around $7.
   The problems shifted the headlines, in Dell's own words, ``from
whiz kid to fizz kid.'' One publication called him ``the enfant
terrible of personal computers.''
   ``We think the perception of the company is quite different than
what's going on here,'' Dell said, describing his company as ``a
new, unique and different kind of entity...we have merged a design
and manufacturing operation for computers together into an entity.''
   But even Dell admits there were problems, although he attributes
them to success-caused malfunctions that have been fixed.
   ``I think the stock market is going to wait until it sees
tangible proof that Dell is turning around,'' said Daniel C.
Benton, who follows Dell for Goldman Sachs.
   ``The balance sheet has eroded; margins have eroded,'' Benton
said. Dell ``has phenomenal long-term prospects,'' he said, but the
market focuses on immediate gratification.
   To explain his problems, Dell draws diagrams on a note pad to
demonstrate how a backlog of orders in the second quarter of the
year inflated third quarter sales, which in turn caused forecasters
to expect unrealistic fourth quarter production.
   At the same time, Dell was anticipating huge fourth quarter
sales based on a barrage of favorable reviews in computer
magazines. The sales didn't reach expectations, saddling the
company with a large _ and in some cases high-priced _ inventory.
   ``I think he's right that the backlog issue created too high
expectations,'' Benton admitted, but added, ``If overlooking that
made us have high expectations, he did it too.''
   Much like a chastised teen-ager promising he has changed, Dell
says his company has learned from the past, with a new structure
and some new managers.
   ``The best thing I could do for the company is to find the best
people and give them the responsibility to do the job,'' he said
during an interview in his penthouse office in Austin's exclusive
Arboretum business park.
   Dell describes his workers, who average about 27 years old, as
``1,200 totally fired up, foaming at the mouth employees.''
   He often points to Glenn Henry, vice president of research and
development. Henry, 47, came from IBM's nearby laboratory in
Austin, where he helped the giant develop its Unix program for PCs.
   Henry is trying to turn the company to more technological
innovation, and Dell holds two of its own patents with more pending.
   Henry replaced Graham Beachum, hired on at Dell from Tandy Corp.
Beachum left last year following a bitter dispute with Dell over
most areas of the business.
   Dell said the blowup ``hurt the entire company, hurt me, hurt
Graham, hurt the employees here,'' but Beachum had to go because
``clearly we had a guy here who was not the right guy.''
   For his part, Beachum told Business Week magazine that Dell was
unwilling to spend money building a sales force, and that Dell's
plan for a Personal System-2 clone was ``ego-driven.''
   Henry since has scrapped those plans, and Dell says he learned
he shouldn't announce products before they're ready to be shipped.
   In the reorganization, Dell established separate subsidiaries
for domestic and overseas clients. Within Dell USA are divisions
for small customers, principally individuals and small businesses;
larger businesses; potential customers in government and education;
and resellers.
   In the meantime, Dell enjoys his riches _ he owns 10.7 million
shares of the company, even after selling 300,000 shares at about
$11 per share, or $3.3 million.
   Though Dell says his job ``is not what I would consider work,''
he does not consider himself the stereotypical yuppie obsessed with
the quest for riches and is planning to marry in a few months.
   ``I work a fairly normal set of hours for a busy person like
myself,'' he says. ``I take a good number of vacations to make sure
that I'm well-prepared to do my job.''

<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. on Wednesday said its
second-quarter earnings slipped 2.7 percent from last year's
results that included a contribution from its Van Camp Seafood
operations which have since been sold.
   Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31 amounted to $90.8
million, or $1.39 a share, compared with earnings of $93.3 million,
or $1.35 a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 14.3 percent to $1.6 billion from
$1.4 billion for the same period last year. The company said its
Van Camp operations accounted for $4.6 million in net earnings in
the second quarter last year.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Ralston said its
net earnings rose 30.1 percent to $293.5 million, or $4.44 a share,
compared with net earnings of $225.7 million, or $3.25 a share, a
year earlier.
   Six-month revcenue rose 12 percent to $3.27 billion from $2.92
billion for the same period last year.
   Operating profit in the human foods and pet foods operation
increased this year over last year, the company said.
   Continental Baking Co.'s operating profit was down for the
quarter due to lower cake volume. But for the six months, higher
bread volume kept Continental's operating profit even with last
year.
   Operating profit for the quarter and the six months for Eveready
Battery was down as a result of heavy advertising and promotional
spending, the company said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp. earnings rose 10 percent in the latest quarter,
the personal computer software maker said Wednesday, belying its
own forecast of an earnings decline.
   Microsoft rival Ashton-Tate Corp. reported a small earnings
gain, while Wang Laboratories Inc. predicted it would post the
worst quarterly loss in two years in its third fiscal quarter.
   Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said it earned $41.1 million, or
73 cents per share, in the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, up
from $37.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 22 percent to $197 million from $161.8 million a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Microsoft's
earnings rose 33.3 percent to $184.1 million, or $2.23 a share,
from $140.9 million, or $1.68 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
38.8 percent to $583.3 million from $420.4 million a year earlier.
   Microsoft's stock plunged last month when the company predicted
an earnings decline, the first such drop since the company went
public three years ago.
   Some shareholders complained last month that they weren't
adequately warned about the company's difficulties. Now it turns
out that the warnings were overstated. March results turned out
better than expected, according to Pam Edstrom, a spokeswoman at
Microsoft's public relations firm.
   ``At least this news was better than the other news,'' she said.
   Lowell, Mass.-based Wang Laboratories said it expects to lose
some $55 million in its third quarter. Last week, Wang announced
plans to drop its worldwide payroll to 28,500 by June 1990. It had
31,700 employees in November, when it began a policy of not filling
vacancies.
   Wang plans to release its actual earnings figure Friday, two
days behind schedule.
   In a statement released Wednesday, the computer manufacturer
said unit sales and total revenues will be ``approximately equal''
to that of the previous quarter and the third quarter of fiscal
1988. Wang's sales totalled $767.9 million a year ago and $760.7
million in 1989's second quarter.
   Wang blamed this quarter's loss on increased discounting of
product sales, lower maintentance revenue in the United States, and
a shift to lower-margin sales of personal computers. The firm's
main business is minicomputers.
   The firm has followed 1988's $92 million gain with disappointing
profits of $13.1 million and $1 million the first two quarters of
this fiscal year.
   Ashton-Tate, of Torrance, Calif., said its net income rose to
$11.5 million, or 44 cents a share, from $11.1 million, or 43 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $89.8 million from $72.4
million a year earlier.
   The company attributed the flat earnings to increased research

<HEAD>Pickens Says Corporate Buyouts Will Find Their Way into Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens said
Wednesday that corporate buyouts helped invigorate the U.S. economy
in the 1980s, and similar tactics will find their way into Japanese
business in the 1990s.
   Pickens visited Japan for talks with management of Koito
Manufacturing Co. after buying 20.2 percent of its shares _ a move
he said was not a prelude to a takeover attempt or greenmail.
   ``We want to work with Koito managment. We aren't doing anything
hostile,'' he said, adding that he was investing for ``the long
term.''
   Meanwhile, Koito, which expressed surprise and concern at the
time of Pickens' purchase, announced Wednesday evening that it was
transferring the shares to Pickens' ownership, dropping a request
to the Ministry of Finance to investigate whether there were any
technical irregularities that might block the purchase.
   Pickens is scheduled to meet Thursday with the president of the
company, said a company spokesman.
   At a luncheon Wednesday with the American Chamber of Commerce in
Japan, Pickens argued that corporate buyouts helped put the U.S.
economy back on its feet in the 1980s by ousting ineffective
management and making its companies more competitive.
   ``What happened in the U.S. in the 1980s will find its way to
the Japanese business community in the 1990s,'' he said.
   Analysts in Tokyo say Pickens' visit is a challenge to basic
thinking in Japan's business community that a company belongs to
its employees, not its shareholders.
   Pickens gained fame and fortune in the United States by buying
and reorganizing companies and often purging company executives,
arguing that bad managers don't give shareholders the returns they
deserve.
   He said in Tokyo Wednesday that his ``shareholders' rights''
movement would soon spread to Japan.
   ``Shareholders rights will become a worldwide issue,'' he added.
   But many Japanese businessmen, and some foreign critics, believe
that the American emphasis on return to shareholders has caused
U.S. companies to lose competitiveness to Japanese companies.
   ``Japanese companies don't generally have to answer to
shareholders with short-term profits. They can focus on longer-term
growth. Just look at these two economies to see which approach has
been more successful,'' said Keith Donaldson, an analyst at James
Capel Pacific Ltd.
   Koito makes headlights and other parts for Toyota Motor Co.,
which owns 19.1 percent of the company. Pickens' shares are worth
about $1 billion at current market prices.
   Despite Pickens' denial, ``many people think it is greenmail,''
Shigeju Kita, general manager in charge of mergers and acquisitions
at Yamaichi Securities, said of Pickens' stock purchase.
   Greenmail is a premium paid by a company to buy back stock from
an unwanted suitor.
   Pickens says he is challenging barriers to foreign investment in
Japan, and many Americans are cheering him on.
   ``I am concerned that American investors don't have the same
access in Japan as Japanese have in the U.S.,'' Pickens told
reporters.
   Pickens said he could not judge how open or closed the Japanese
market was until he saw the results of his present enterprise.
   But he added that ``people in Washington are watching this
carefully. ... Japan-bashers ... will come to the surface pretty
quick'' if they think that an American company is being unfairly
treated in Japan, he said.
   Pickens told the American Chamber audience he was considering
running for governor of Texas.
   Later, he told reporters that the Koito deal ``was not done with
political motives in mind, but I've had people suggest it might be
an advantage in a political race.''

   Stock prices pushed ahead today, getting a
little more mileage out of the rally that has carried the market to
its highest levels since the crash of 1987.
   Analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from
spreading hopes that inflationary pressures might be easing and
interest rates were turning downward.
   Inflation figures for March, unlike those for the two previous
months, contained no unpleasant surprises that seemed likely to
prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit further.
   Signs of a slowing economy also raise some new worries for
investors. For one thing, some observers suggest, they could lead
to heightened concern about the possibility of a recession.
   However, brokers said, any such fears were countered today by
strong earnings reports from several prominent companies.

<HEAD>Reports Decrease In First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp. said Wednesday that
it had a 12 percent decrease in first-quarter net earnings, due in
part to declining earnings in its military aircraft operation.
   Net earnings for the first quarter of 1989 were $75.4 million,
or $1.81 a share, on revenue of $2.36 billion, compared with net
earnings of $85.7 million, or $2.04 a share, on revenue of $2.42
billion during the same period last year.
   The decline in operating earnings in the military aircraft
segment resulted from lower volume and a reduction of the earnings
rate in the F-16 program, said Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief
executive. Those trends reflected lower margins on recent contract
awards as well as cost increases resulting from simultaneous
production of more than 20 versions of the aircraft, he said.
   Pace said that improved manufacturing techniques and cost
containments continued to raise the peformance level of the
company's land systems business. He also cited increasing demand
for business jets as contributing to a favorable performance in the
general aviation business.
   Among the contracts the St. Louis-based company won during the
first quarter was for the lead ship construction for the Seawolf
class of attack submarines and for the upgrading of the M1A1 Abrams
tank.
   The company also signed an agreement with St. Louis-based
McDonnell Douglas, valued at about $2 billion over the next six
years, for production of fuselages for the MD-11 aircraft.

<HEAD>Big First-Quarter Profit Drop Blamed on Earlier Tax Benefit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp.'s profit plunged in
the first quarter, but the decline was attributed to a huge
one-time tax benefit in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
   Northrop, which has been rocked by a series of allegations of
overbilling and a defense fraud indictment, said Wednesday its
first-quarter profit fell to $9.7 million, or 21 cents a share,
from $139.6 million, or $2.97 a share in the first quarter of 1988.
   The difference was the result of a one-time gain of $135.1
million in the earlier quarter, when the company took advantage of
a law that allowed it to defer payment of taxes in earlier years
until the new, lower corporate tax rate took effect.
   Without the tax benefit, earnings in 1988's first quarter would
have been $4.5 million, or less than half of this year's
first-quarter income.
   Northrop's sales in the first quarter were $1.28 billion, down 7
percent from $1.37 billion a year earlier.
   The company also took a charge against profits of $26 million
for unplanned research and development expenses on an electronic
defense system for the F-15 fighter jet.
   Northrop made a similar provision in the fourth quarter of last
year for development of the system, called the ALQ-135, but didn't
reveal the amount of the write-off for that quarter.
   Overall sales declined for several reasons: Less Pentagon money
for research and development of the B-2 stealth bomber, which is
moving into production; fewer MX missile sales; and fewer
deliveries of fuselages for the FA-18 Hornet fighter, which is
built by McDonnell Douglas Corp. for the Navy.
   The sales declines were partly offset by an increase in
deliveries of 747 airliner fuselages to Boeing Corp.
   Northrop has been the target of several lawsuits by employee
``whistleblowers'' who allege the company overcharged the
government on various projects.
   The corporation and five present and former employees were
charged this month with conspiracy and fraud in an alleged scheme
to fake tests on a device used to guide cruise missiles.
   Northrop denies any wrongdoing.

   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. became the
biggest and most profitable Japanese business after the government
tranformed it from a public monopoly into a private company four
years ago.
   But now NTT faces restructuring and possible dismemberment,
partly because of links to one of the worst political scandals in
Japan's postwar history.
   Critics and former officials blame NTT's problems on confusion
about whether it really has become private. The government still
owns three-quarters of NTT's stock, and its employees are subject
to the same restrictions as public servants.
   ``The most serious mistake was the government tried to satisfy
everyone, including politicians, government agencies and NTT's
labor union,'' said Yoichi Sando, an analyst at Asahi Research
Center, a private thinktank.
   ``That left NTT in an ambiguous status of half-public and
half-private in the past four years,'' he said. ``NTT was
consistently under pressure to fulfil these two contradictory
roles.''
   NTT appeared to be successfully transforming itself into a
competitive company after the government privatized it in April
1985, following trends in the United States and Britain to promote
competition in telecommunications.
   It has has undergone major changes since then, reducing its work
force by more than 10 percent and launching many new services.
   ``We would never be able to make those drastic changes if we
remained government-owned,'' Haruo Yamaguchi, president and chief
executive of NTT, told the Associated Press in an interview. ``The
privatization was certainly a major turning point in our company's
43-year history.''
   The privatized NTT became the most profitable company in Japan
with record earnings of 496.7 billion yen or about $3.8 billion in
1987. It was also the most popular company among new university
graduates seeking jobs in 1987 and 1988 because of what they saw as
its stability and progressive image.
   But big trouble surfaced when NTT's link to a major bribery
scandal surfaced last year. It has led to the arrests of former
chairman Hisashi Shinto and three other senior executives since
February.
   Prosecutors are also investigating the company's lobbying
practices with politicians, and there is some expectation that NTT
will somehow be restructured or broken up.
   The price of the utility's stock, once the most popular issue on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has been stuck around 1.5-million-yen a
share, or $11,360, less than half its peak of 3.18 million yen a
share in April 1987.
   Critics say NTT has been victimized by conflicting interests of
politicians and bureaucrats.
   Hajime Nakayama, a former official of the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, which supervises NTT, said the ministry was
under strong pressure to deregulate the communication market.
   But when the ministry suggested breaking up NTT into regional
competitors and reducing parliamentary oversight, he said, ``we met
with opposition from politicians and government officials who have
a large stake in NTT.''
   The company was left in the awkward position of having to
compete with other companies while being required to aid the same
rivals in the name of fair competition.
   NTT president Yamaguchi said the unclear status sometimes
hindered his ability to run the company effectively.
   ``I am aware we really have no other choice but to let the
govenment decide what they will do with us,'' he said. ``But
frankly, I wish they would leave us alone and let us run the
company on our own, or don't privatize it at all.''
   Critics say the firm's alleged involvement in the bribery affair
symbolizes its dilemma. Shinto and other executives were charged
with receiving bribes from an information-based conglomerate called
Recruit, which leased equipment from NTT and bought two U.S.-made
supercomputers from it.
   But legal experts say the alleged bribes would have been an
ordinary business practice if the deal took place between two
private companies.
   The 1985 law that changed NTT's status says its workers remain
``semi-public servants'' and prohibits them from receiving money
and valuables.
   After the arrests of the senior officials, NTT employees
expressed confusion about their status. Some were surprised that
they were still subject to the same laws as politicians and public
servants, though they no longer enjoy the privileges of public
servants.
   ``The arrest of the chairman reminded many of us that we are not
all that private as we thought we were,'' said Takao Nakajima, a
head of the firm's advertising section.

   The dollar bounced back Wednesday from its
decline of the previous session, boosted by higher oil prices.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the rise in the dollar was
amplified by purchases by traders who had been betting on its
continued decline and had to buy dollars to cover short positions.
   Oil futures prices spurted to a three-year high Wednesday after
a North Sea gas explosion and an industry report that showed U.S.
production falling to its lowest level since the 1960s.
   The rise in oil prices increased inflation fears, raising the
possibility that the Federal Reserve would tighten credit to stop
inflation. Tight credit attracts global investors to dollars.
   A government inflation report had lowered the dollar on Tuesday
by diminishing the likelihood of credit-tightening by the Fed.
   Wednesday's higher oil prices lowered the Japanese yen against
the dollar because Japan depends on imported oil.
   The yen was also hurt by an unfounded rumor that Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita had resigned, according to Nazem Elsabeh,
a trader and vice president at Republic National Bank of New York.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7113 late Wednesday from
$1.7185 late Tuesday. Later in New York the pound fell to $1.7108
from $1.7164.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 131.88 Japanese yen, down from
132.10 yen late Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar traded at
132.10 yen. In New York the dollar rose to 132.58 yen from 131.40
on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late rates, included: 1.8623 West German marks, up from 1.8525;
1.6373 Swiss francs, up from 1.6270; 1.1858 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1863; 6.3040 French francs, up from 6.2710; and 1,364.38
Italian lire, up from 1,360.13.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's rates:
1.8615 West German marks, up from 1.8528; 1.6360 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6283; 6.3025 French francs, up from 6.2750; 2.0985 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0935; 1,363.75 Italian lire, down from
1,366.95; and 1.1865 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1848.
   In the bullion markets, prices were narrowly mixed.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at $384.25 an ounce, down from $386.68
late Tuesday. Gold traded at a late bid of $383.95 a troy ounce in
London, up from $383.25 late Tuesday. But the late bid price for
gold fell to $383.50 an ounce in Zurich from $384.00 late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $383.40 an ounce from $383.50 on Wednesday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $382.80 an
ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $383.10 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.79 a troy
ounce, up from $5.78 late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.750 an ounce from $5.763 on
Wednesday.

   Higher quarterly profits were reported Wednesday by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and three of its Baby Bell offspring,
BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group and Ameritech.
   AT&amp;T said it earned $594 million, or 55 cents a share, up from
$492 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$8.66 billion from $8.39 billion a year earlier.
   The company's depreciation expenses declined, boosting profits.
But for accounting reasons the company reported an $88 million
one-time charge against earnings to reflect a change in the method
of depreciating assets.
   Chicago-based Ameritech said its earnings rose 1.9 percent to
$300.8 million, or $1.12 a share, on revenues of $2.5 billion, from
$295.1 million, or $1.08 a share, on revenue of $2.4 billion a year
earlier.
   Atlanta-based BellSouth said its earnings rose 4.3 percent to
$449.6 million, or 97 cents a share, from $430.9 million, or 90
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.2 percent to $3.37
billion from $3.2 billion a year earlier.
   However, BellSouth's earnings would have fallen to about $404
million if not for one-time factors, the company said.
   San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, one of the seven so-called
Baby Bells created in 1984 by the breakup of AT&amp;T, reported
first-quarter earnings of $317 million, or 76 cents per share, up
5.7 percent from $300 million, or 71 cents, in the first quarter of
1988.
   PacTel's revenues for the period increased to $2.34 billion, 1.5
percent more than the $2.3 billion reported for the same quarter
last year.

<HEAD>First Quarter Earnings Up at Two Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Assocaited Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp and Bank of Boston Corp., two of the
nation's largest bank holding companies, reported Wednesday that
their first-quarter profits rose over a year ago.
   First Interstate, based in Los Angeles, said it earned $132.2
million, or $2.81 a share, for the three months ended March 31, up
29 percent from $102.6 million, or $2.20 a share, in 1988.
   Bank of Boston, based in Boston, said net income totaled $89
million, or $1.23 per share, up 6 percent from earnings of $84
million, or $1.17 a share, last year.
   First Interstate attributed its higher earnings partly to a
$21.8 million tax benefit and an accounting change that added $16.1
million. In the comparable quarter for 1988, a tax benefit boosted
profit by $15 million.
   Net interest income in the first quarter rose to $636.8 million
from $564.7 million a year ago. Non-interest income climbed to
$259.9 million from $238.9 million a year earlier. Non-interest
expense was $605.3 million, up from $580.1 million a year ago.
   First Interstate's Texas subsidiary, formerly Allied Bancshares
Inc. of Houston, lost $24.3 million in the first quarter, compared
to a loss of $2.1 million a year ago. The company blamed the loss
on continued weakness in the state's economy.
   But First Interstate banks in California, Arizona, Oregon,
Washington and Nevada turned in strong performances and most of the
other state banks reported gains, said J.J. Pinola, chairman and
chief executive.
   Bank of Boston Chairman Ira Stepanian said he was pleased with
the latest earnings report, ``especially considering last year's
particularly strong first quarter.''
   ``This year's improvement includes no special items and reflects
higher net interest revenue,'' he said in a statement.
   Consolidated net interest revenue totaled $322 million, an 11
percent increase over $292 million in 1988.
   Non-interest income for the quarter was $161 million, compared
with $176 million in 1988. Non-interest expense was $297 million, a
3 percent increase over 1988.

   General Motors Corp.'s financing subsidiary
Wednesday reported a modest rise in first-quarter earnings while
the automaker's aviation and electronics arm reported a sharp 16.6
percent profit decline.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp. said rising interest rates held
quarterly net income to $356.4 million, a 0.6 percent rise over
$354.4 million in the same 1988 period.
   The 1989 earnings included $50.7 million from the sale to Isuzu
Motors of a 51 percent interest GMAC held in Isuzu Motors Finance
Co.
   GMAC said its average cost of borrowings worldwide rose to 9.2
percent for the quarter ending March 31 from 7.8 percent a year
earlier.
   GMAC's total earning assets rose to $95.3 billion as of March
31, up from $94.7 billion a year earlier. Earning assets are
amounts owed GMAC on which it receives interest.
   GM Hughes Electronics Corp., the aviation and electronics arm,
said net income fell to $201.1 million, or 51 cents a share of GM
Class H common stock, from $252 billion, or 63 cents a share in the
first quarter of 1988.
   The 1988 period's earnings were inflated by 13 cents a share by
the sale of part of GMHE's stock in Nippon Avionics Co., and 5
cents a share by an accounting change at GMHE's Delco Electronics
Corp. subsidiary, the company said.
   GMHE's revenues rose 12.7 percent to $3.01 billion for the
quarter from $2.67 billion in the year-earlier period, the company
said.
   Electronic Data Systems Corp., the data processing subsidiary,
said new insurance, financial, commercial and government
data-processing contracts helped raise net income 12 percent.
   EDS, which provides information services for GM and outside
customers, reported net income of $100 million, or 82 cents a share
of GM Class E common stock. That was up 12.2 percent from $89.1
million in the first quarter of 1988.
   EDS said revenue totaled $1.29 billion, up from $1.12 billion in
the year-earlier period, with 56 percent of the revenue from GM and
44 percent from other customers.
   New data processing contracts included a 12-year agreement with
Whitehall Insurance Holdings Ltd. in New York, and a 10-year
contract with Meritor Savings Bank of Philadelphia, EDS said.
   EDS said it signed new contracts with international customers
including BASF, West Germany's largest chemical company; Danone, a
Spanish dairy products company; DANZAS-SATEM, a French distribution
company; Banco Investimento Garantia, a Brazilian bank; and
International Bank of Asia in Hong Kong.
   GM's parent company was to announce its earnings Thursday.

   Stock prices kept climbing Wednesday, getting a
little more mileage out of the rally that has carried the market to
its highest levels since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.51 to 2,386.91,
bringing its gain over the past four sessions to 90.91 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
827 up, 634 down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 191.51 million
shares, down from 208.65 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 227.87 million shares.
   Analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from
spreading hopes that inflationary pressures might be easing and

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose ] to 33{. The company
reported a 20.6 percent increase in its first quarter earnings, and
said it had a good chance to keep up that pace.

   Elsewhere, Carson Pirie Scott, traded on the Big Board, gained
1| to 23]. The company said P.A. Bergner &amp; Co. raised its takeover
offer from $20 a share to $24 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.57 to 171.70.

<HEAD>Merc Proposes to Ban Most `Dual Trading' Improve Surveillance, Auditing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the biggest futures markets proposed
sweeping changes Wednesday that would double surveillance and limit
a controversial trading practice in response to a federal fraud
probe that has tainted Chicago's financial industry.
   Many of the recommendations contained in a report by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's Special Committee to Review Trading Practices
were under consideration earlier, said Leo Melamed, vice chairman
of the committee.
   ``But the time frame was compressed as a result of the
investigation,'' Melamed told a news confererence where the
proposals were unveiled.
   John Geldermann, chairman of the special committee, said the
public perception of the exchange has suffered in the three months
since disclosure of the undercover FBI probe. He said it was
important to release the recommendations to maintain investor
confidence.
   ``The failure to respond quickly would have shown a lack of
leadership,'' said Geldermann, who also is chairman of the Merc's
Board of Governors. The recommendations will be submitted to that
board for a decision expected within 60 days.
   The most imporant restriction would be limits on dual trading, a
controversial practice, enables a trader to trade his own account
at the same time he handles customers' accounts.
   While the practice is allowed by many financial exchanges, many
consider it susceptible to abuse because it allows unscrupulous
traders to allocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dump
losing trades on customers.
   The nine-member committee was appointed in late January,
following disclosures that the federal government was investigating
allegations involving the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The federal probe concerns allegations that as many as 100
brokers at the two sprawling exchanges systematically cheated
investors out of millions of dollars through illegal trading
practices.
   No indictments have been announced yet, but as many as 200
subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the
exchanges.
   Some market experts viewed the formation of the special
committee as part of the futures industry's effort to hold the line
against further government regulation, which it historically has
rejected as cumbersome and unneeded.
   Melamed said he made the rounds Tuesday in Washington and
carried the committee's reports to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the federal agency charged with regulating the
industry, as well as key House and Senate members with agriculture
or industry oversight responsibilities.
   ``It was received extremely favorably by everyone ... No one
mentioned anything beyond what we were saying,'' he added.
   Proponents argue that dual trading increases the amount of
buyers and sellers because traders can continue doing business when
they don't have outside orders.
   But the Merc committee, with few exceptions, recommended dual
trading be banned from futures contracts in cases where market
volume already is substantial.
   The panel also recommended the Merc's full-time floor
surveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members and
adopt specific guidelines _ with penalties ranging from a 30-day
trading suspension to expulsion _ for rule violations involving
financial injury to public customers.
   Among other recommendations:
   _More extensive screening of membership applicants.
   _Members of a broker association should not be allowed to
execute personal trades against orders by members of the broker
group.
   _Addition of one non-Merc member to all major disciplinary
committees. ``The criticism is that we're too clubby,'' said
Melamed. ``This would enable the public to view the process and see
we are open-handed.''
   _Daily computerized trade information for members covering all
activity from the previous day.
   Asked whether he expected the recommendations to stave off
further government intervention into industry business, Melamed
replied, ``Self-regulation requires that you deserve
self-regulation. And in order to deserve it, you must prove that
you're responsible.''

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Slide On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for corn and soybeans to be harvested this fall fell
sharply Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade on forecasts for
rain later this week in the western Corn Belt, a key growing area
hit hard by last summer's drought.
   Wheat futures prices rose due to persistent dryness in Kansas,
where the winter wheat crop already has sustained severe damage.
   On other markets, oil futures posted steep gains, livestock and
meat futures prices tumbled and precious metals were slightly lower.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 4} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.11} a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4{ cents
lower with May at $2.73 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2} cents
lower with May at $1.97 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 11\
cents lower with May at $7.45 a bushel.
   ``Welcome to the weather market,'' said Ted Mao, a New
York-based grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
referring to the recent volatility in the grain markets.
   Corn and soybean planting has barely begun but the grain markets
are extremely sensitive to weather changes because last year's
drought lowered U.S. grain stockpiles. Another drought year could
drain stocks down to critical levels and cause prices to skyrocket.
   Some private meteorologists who had been predicting dry weather
for the rest of this week in Iowa and northwestern Illinois put
more rain into their noon forecasts on Wednesday, prompting heavy
selling of corn and soybean contracts.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new
six-to-10 day forecast calling for above-normal rainfall in the
western Midwest and normal precipitation in the region's central
and eastern portions, which could prompt further selling of corn
and soybean futures on Thursday.
   ``The irony is that most experts agree that beyond 72 hours, the
degree of accuracy in a forecast drops geometrically,'' Mao said,
``and yet everybody pays attention to those forecasts because there
isn't anything else to trade on.''
   Unleaded gasoline prices surged on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, leading the crude oil and heating oil markets higher,
following Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute report of
substantial reductions in U.S. supplies of crude and gasoline.
   Further buying was spurred by reports that the Shell Oil Co.'s
British subsidiary had advise clients of possible shipment delays
for North Sea crude oil following the shutdown late Tuesday of a
damaged oil platform.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to $1.10
higher with May at $22.61 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to .71
cent higher with May at 53.33 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.75 cent to 1.20 cents higher with May at 74.62 cents a gallon.
   The sharp losses in livestock and meat futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange were due more to profit-taking and technical
factors than to Wednesday's weaker cash markets, analysts said.
   Trading activity has grown cautious ahead of Friday's quarterly
Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, which is expected to
show first-quarter placements of cattle on feedlots to be 3 percent
to 10 percent above the first quarter of 1988.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1.02 cents lower with June at
70.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .57 cent to .97 cent lower
with May at 75.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent to .80
cent lower with June at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.05 cents to 1.88 cents lower with May at 31.57 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures prices inched lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange. Investment demand for the metals has fallen
following government economic reports that indicate the economy is
slowing and inflation is holding steady.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 60 cents lower with June at $387.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents lower with May at
$5.765 a troy ounce.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo remained
locked on a collision course with the federal judge overseeing
Eastern Airlines' bankruptcy case by insisting Wednesday that the
strike-wracked carrier will be shrunk not sold.
   ``There are a lot of people out there who want to buy Eastern
Airlines for some beads, jelly beans or whatever comes to mind,''
Lorenzo told a small group of reporters at Texas Air's New York
office.
   ``Eastern has to be built back the old-fashioned way ... We
don't think that any sale transaction makes sense.''
   That position puts Lorenzo at loggerheads with U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland, who appears poised to put the entire
airline up for sale _ including assets held by Miami-based Eastern
before Texas Air acquired it three years ago for about $676 million.
   Lifland, who generally refrains from speaking to reporters on
pending cases, was unavailable for comment.
   Furthermore, the 15-member committee representing Eastern's
major creditors could be skeptical of Lorenzo's plan to reduce
Eastern to 60 percent of its pre-strike size, sources said. The
committee is scheduled to meet Thursday, but Eastern attorney David
Boies said the plan won't be presented to creditors until next week.
   Lorenzo's insistence on holding and shrinking Eastern could be
aimed at luring back the airline's rebellious pilots, whose support
for the Machinists' strike has been critical to its success, a
union official said.
   ``His position is to threaten the pilots with `This is the only
airline we're going to have; you'd better jump on the bandwagon,'''
said Dan Ashby, a spokesman in New York for the Air Line Pilots
Association. ``The pilots are definitely holding ... This is a
desperation ploy.''
   Bruce Simon, an attorney for the pilots union, likening the
Lorenzo-Lifland showdown to ``a shootout at the OK Corral,'' said
the ``notion that you can shrink your way to profitability is sheer
lunacy.''
   There had been speculation that Texas Air's refusal to sell
Eastern, expressed by its board of directors on Monday, was a
negotiating ploy designed to elicit a higher price for the airline,
which has been mired in a strike and bankruptcy court proceedings
for more than a month.
   Last week, after the collapse of Lorenzo's $464 million deal to
sell Eastern to ex-baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth,
Eastern officials said the airline would be sharply reduced.
   Lorenzo, who wore a yellow shirt and bright blue tie but no
jacket during the informal meeting with reporters, looked less
weary than he had at the federal courthouse last week but still
showed the toll of the protracted strike and bankruptcy case.
   He insisted that Eastern will be able to rebuild to a smaller
level without the fractious pilots returning to work. The airline
will need an estimated 1,500 pilots to run 60 percent of its
previous operations. Of the 3,600 or so Eastern pilots, only 200
have crossed picket lines.
   ``We can train pilots at a very substantial rate,'' Lorenzo
said. He disputed the pilots union's claim of a nationwide pilot
shortage.
   Asked whether a sharply reduced Eastern would be viable, Lorenzo
said, ``We believe it (would be) but there are no guarantees in
this world.''
   The Texas Air chief also refuted earlier statements by attorneys
for Eastern and the pilots union that another potential buyer had
emerged besides Ueberroth, hotelier Jay Pritzker and takeover
strategist Carl Icahn.
   ``There is no serious fourth bidder,'' Lorenzo said. He insisted
there are no talks currently between his company and potential
suitors.
   Lorenzo said Ueberroth had called him Tuesday and made it ``very
plain that he's out of the deal.''
   Sources close to Ueberroth, however, said Wednesday the two men
have continued negotiating by telephone.
   Simon, the pilots' attorney, insisted Wednesday that the fourth
bidding group has met with David I. Shapiro, the bankruptcy
examiner for Eastern.
   ``They are putting together their bid,'' Simon said.
   A source close to the situation, who asked not to be identified,
called the fourth bidder ``a serious and substantial presence.''
   Workers struck the nation's seventh-largest carrier March 4 in a
longstanding dispute with Lorenzo, accusing him of dismembering
Eastern and feeding its assets to sister Texas Air subsidiary
Continental Airlines. Lorenzo put the company into federal
bankruptcy court protection March 9.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. announced a
20.6 percent increase in first-quarter profit Wednesday, thrust
ahead by an expensive restructuring last year that produced its
first annual loss.
   The phone giant achieved the improved results despite intense
competition across its range of businesses, Robert E. Allen,
chairman and chief executive, told shareholders at the company's
104th annual meeting.
   ``We're seeing new vigor in our long-distance business and
strong growth in international sales of products and services,''
Allen said.
   The stock rose 37{ cents a share to $33.50 in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Shareholders rejected a pair of shareholder proposals on
affirmative action, one to strengthen it and one to stop it. Also
rejected were proposals to get more information on AT&amp;T's lobbying
and on its involvement in Star Wars defense contracts.
   AT&amp;T said it earned $594 million or 55 cents a share in the
first three months of 1989, up from $492 million or 46 cents a
share a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.2 percent to $8.66 billion
from $8.39 billion a year earlier.
   Earnings would have risen even more if the company had not
adopted a more aggressive method of depreciating the value of its
assets. The change cut $88 million from first-quarter profits.
   AT&amp;T lost $1.67 billion last year, the result of a huge
accounting charge that covered the cost of accelerating its
transition to modern digital technology.
   As part of the restructuring, the company said last year it was
scrapping outdated analog phone equipment and moving, retiring or
laying off 16,000 employees.
   Although the charge produced a loss last year it is adding to
profitability this year by lowering the company's payroll and
depreciation expenses.
   Allen declined to predict profits for the rest of the year but
said he would not be surprised if they kept up the same pace.
``This is not an aberration, at least based on our business plan.''
   AT&amp;T is no longer the world's largest company since the 1984
Bell System breakup, but it remains the most widely held stock in
the country, with 2.6 million shareowners.
   Allen told 2,360 shareholders in Radio City Music Hall that the
company was getting closer to being able to raise its quarterly
dividend, which has been stuck at 30 cents a share since
divestiture.
   Richard Toole, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst, predicted the
dividend might be raised early next year.
   Allen was elected chairman the night before the 1988 annual
meeting in Denver following the death a day earlier of Chairman
James E. Olson. Olson's unexpected death cast a pall over that
gathering.
   ``Aside from the emotional aspect, I feel much more
comfortable'' after a year on the job, Allen told a news
conference. ``I have a good sense of the business, the people,
what's important, where we're going.''
   In long-distance, Allen said aggressive advertising and sales
promotions, an expanded sales force and increased regulatory
flexibility were paying off.
   Product sales grew 4.5 percent, mainly because of higher
international sales of telecommunications network equipment and
increases in microelectronic components, sales to the federal
government and some computer products. Also, sales of the newly
acquired Paradyne Corp. were included in the results for the first
time.
   Shareholders rejected a proposal by the National Alliance, a
white-supremacist organization, to phase out aspects of AT&amp;T's
affirmative action program ``which are directed toward recruiting,
employing or promoting individuals from any particular racial or
ethnic group.''
   However, 8.1 percent of the shares were voted in favor,
entitling the group to resubmit it next year. A proposal by an AT&amp;T
employee, Alex Tillman, to strengthen and provide details on the
affirmative action received support from 4.7 percent of the shares,
falling below the 6 percent cutoff for resubmission.
   Allen said AT&amp;T management opposed both proposals but reserved
his main criticism for the National Alliance one, which he
described as an insult to AT&amp;T employees.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission suggested Wednesday the agency still might pursue action
against the head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and other top
executives of the investment firm.
   SEC Chairman David Ruder, testifying before a House
subcommittee, said he expects the agency's enforcement division to
``pursue the activities of all the Drexel officials who were in
responsiblity'' during the time when massive securities violations
allegedly were committed.
   ``It is not unlikely that our investigation will reveal other
persons against whom action might be brought,'' Ruder told the
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on finance and telecommunications.
   Drexel last week agreed to a settlement of SEC civil charges
under which the firm will be subject to close federal monitoring
for three years and will restructure its operations and sever ties
with its junk bond chief, Michael Milken, who was indicted on
racketeering charges last month.
   The company also has agreed to plead guilty to six felony
charges and pay $650 million in fines and penalties in what has
become the biggest securities fraud probe in history.
   Asked by the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., why Frederick H. Joseph was allowed to remain as Drexel's
president and chief operating officer under the SEC settlement,
Ruder stressed that the agreement requires Drexel to cooperate in a
continuing SEC investigation of activities at the investment house.
   He said that under standard SEC procedure, a logical follow-up
to the settlement would be for the agency's enforcement division
``to pursue questions of actions by the individuals at Drexel.''
   ``Your statement that we have decided not to take action is
simply not true,'' Ruder said.
   Markey also questioned whether the environment at Drexel could
change for the better if the firm's chief operating officer stays
on.
   ``That is a question with which we have had some concern,''
Ruder acknowledged. ``We have been looking for signs at Drexel at
the top level that there will be a change in culture and we
continue to look for signs that there is a change in culture.''
   He added that ``the primary and most significant'' change is
likely to come with the installment of former SEC Chairman John
Shad as chairman of Drexel's board.
   Ruder said the need for change at Drexel was primarily in its
high-yield junk bond department in California, which Milken had
commanded.
   ``We believe that steps to rework that department will be
effective to accomplish that cultural change,'' Ruder said.

   Warner Communications Inc. said Wednesday
first-quarter profit climbed 46.4 percent, reflecting record
performances by its filmed entertainment, records and cable and
broadcasting operations.
   Warner, which has proposed a merger with Time Inc. that the
companies hope will be approved this year, earned $101 million, or
57 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31 compared with
$68.9 million, or 37 cents a share a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 24.8 percent to $1.46 billion from
$1.17 billion.
   The latest results included $10 million in expenses related to
the pending Time merger and $38 million in charges associated with
stock appreciation-based compensation plans.
   The 1988 results included an after-tax net gain on investments
of $19.1 million and were restated to include results of Lorimar
Telepictures Corp. which Warner acquired in January.
   Warner's filmed entertainment division had operating income of
$66.1 million, nearly double the $34 million last year. Its new
movies included ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``The Accidental
Tourist.''
   Its recorded music and music publishing division had operating
income of $115.6 million, up 64 percent from $70.5 million a year
earlier.
   Releases by Madonna, Debbie Gibson, Roy Orbison and Guns N'
Roses were major contributors domestically, the company said, while
releases by Tracy Chapman, Fleetwood Mac and The Traveling Wilburys
sold well internationally.
   Warner said its cable and broadcasting segment earned a record
$15.2 million, up from $13.3 million a year ago.

   The Kroger Co. said Wednesday it lost $19
million in the first quarter due to increased interest expense and
a corporate restructuring.
   The Cincinnati-based grocery chain's first-quarter results
compared with an after-tax profit of $40.3 million, or 48 cents a
share, in the first quarter of 1988.
   Kroger said it recorded the first-quarter loss despite strong
sales during the period. Revenue totaled $4.5 billion, up from $4.3
billion in the comparable 1988 quarter.
   Kroger launched a $4.6 billion restructuring last fall to fend
off takeover threats from two interested parties. The restructuring
has included sales of stores and food processing plants and the
layoff of 300 headquarters employees.
   Kroger officials said operating cash flow from units not being
sold by the company totaled $192.4 million for the quarter, up 27.3
percent from $151.2 million in the year-ago first quarter.
   Lyle Everingham, Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company helped its first-quarter results with aggressive
marketing programs and by holding down operating costs.
   Kroger announced that a $250 million divestiture loan it took
out as part of its restructuring will be substantially repaid
within 45 days upon completion of the previously announced sale of
Kroger's Price Savers wholesale stores unit.
   The company also said it has hired Bankers Trust Co. to serve as
agent in arranging long-term financing of Kroger's real estate
holdings. Proceeds from those transactions are projected to exceed
$500 million, which Kroger said it will use to further reduce a
$2.7 billion loan. That loan has already been reduced to $2.4
billion, Kroger officials said.

   Although Eastern Airlines has been on strike for
nearly seven weeks, some of its flight attendants still seem to be
serving.
   During the recent marathon negotiations in Washington and New
York between Eastern union officials and ex-baseball commissioner
Peter V. Ueberroth's team, flight attendant representatives seemed
to always get stuck ordering food, coffee and sodas for the group,
some participants in the talks said.
   ``As soon as somebody says `lunch', a flight attendant grabs a
pad and starts writing, taking orders,'' said one negotiator, who
asked not to be identified.
   Some union activists say the situation is typical of the
treatment accorded the flight attendants, who historically have
complained of discrimination. They are considered the easiest
employees to replace in an airline strike and therefore the least
powerful.
   The airline's flight attendants had reason to cheer Wednesday,
however, when they were told that they would be represented on the
Eastern creditors committee. Their union, the Transport Workers
Union, had been excluded from the creditors panel at the start of
Eastern's bankruptcy proceeding while their fellow pilots and
Machinists were represented.
   Mary Jane Barry, president of the Transport Workers local at
Eastern, will be the designated representative and will attend her
first committee meeting on Thursday, union sources said.
   The creditors committee also includes a representative of
non-union employees at Eastern, Mary Grace Shore. Her presence
irritated union officials, who allege that her group _ Positive
Employee Action Committee at Eastern, or PEACE _ is sponsored by
the airline's management.

<HEAD>Profit Rises 5 Pct in 2nd-Qtr on Sale of Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. said
Wednesday its profit rose 5 percent in its latest quarter, largely
because of a one-time gain on the sale of a subsidiary.
   The aerospace company said that sales declines due to the end of
production of the B-1B bomber were offset by higher revenue on
space shuttle, space station and ``star wars'' programs, as well as
gains in the company's electronics and automotive divisions.
   Rockwell earned $270.7 million, or $1.05 a share, in its second
quarter, up from $218.4 million, or 81 cents a share, in the second
quarter of 1988. Sales for the quarter ended March 31 were $3.16
billion, up from $3.04 billion a year earlier.
   Second-quarter results were boosted by a one-time gain of $100
million, after taxes, on the sale of Rockwell's measurement and
flow division, which makes meters and valves, to BTR Dunlop Inc.,
the U.S. subsidiary of BTR PLC, the British maker of sports and
industrial products. In the comparable quarter in 1988, earnings
were increased by a one-time tax adjustment of $50 million.
   In the first half of its fiscal year, Rockwell recorded a profit
of $430.7 million, or $1.67 a share, up from $411.3 million, or
$1.52 a share, in the first half of 1988. Sales in the firsdt half
were $6.03 billion, up from $5.72 billion a year earlier.

   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said Wednesday
higher production led to a 1.7 percent decline in its first-quarter
profit despite a 9.3 percent rise in sales.
   The steelmaker said it earned $45.8 million, or $8.49 per share,
in the latest three months compared with $46.6 million, or $8.68
per share, a year earlier.
   Quarterly sales rose to $287.5 million from $263 million in the
same period in 1988.
   The company, based in Wheeling, W.Va., said shipments increased
to 581,600 tons from 548,100 tons a year earlier.
   A 14.4 percent increase in operating costs reflected additional
shipping activity, blast furnace maintenance and purchases of
semi-finished steel and raw materials, the company said.
   Raw steel production declined 2.5 percent.
   Because it has been operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy
laws since April 16, 1985, Wheeling-Pittsburgh is not paying
interest on most of its debt or bearing the full burden of its
pension plans. It is also benefiting from interest income on cash
that may be distributed to creditors in its bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh made $11.1 million in the first quarter and
$4.5 million a year earlier on its cash balance.
   Had the company been paying interest on its debt, its quarterly
interest costs would have been higher by at least $13.5 million
this year and $12.9 million in 1988, the company said.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs, ADDS x grafs to UPDATE with American Brands
results.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two diversified tobacco giants, Philip Morris
Cos. Inc. and American Brands Inc., reported higher first-quarter
profits Wednesday.
   Philip Morris said its first-quarter profit rose 17.6 percent,
boosted by the contribution from Kraft Inc., which it acquired late
last year.
   Philip Morris, the large cigarette manufacturer that has become
a major consumer products company mainly through acquisitions, said
its profit totaled $590 million, or $2.55 a share, in the quarter
ended March 31 compared to last year's originally reported figures
of $502 million, or $2.12 a share.
   The 1988 first quarter results as originally reported did not
include the effects of new accounting rules pertaining to income
taxes.
   To conform with a change in the method of accounting for income
taxes, Philip Morris restated last year's results.
   Restated, but excluding the effect of the accounting change, net
income came to $490 million, or $2.06 a share in 1988's first
quarter. Income amounted to $763 million, or $3.23 a share, in 1988
after restatement and including the effect of the accounting change.
   Revenue rose 45.1 percent to $10.77 billion in this year's first
quarter from $7.42 billion a year earlier.
   Hamish Maxwell, Philip Morris' chairman and chief executive
officer, said the volume of cigarette sales increased slightly and
the company's share of the cigarette market expanded, aided by the
introduction of the Alpine brand. Among Philip Morris' other
cigarette brands are Marlboro, Virgina Slims and Merit.
   The Kraft General Foods division of Philip Morris posted higher
operating revenue in the first quarter than the comparable combined
Kraft and General Foods results for the year earlier. Kraft became
a subsidiary of Philip Morris in December 1988 and General Foods
was acquired in November 1985.
   Higher unit sales of several prepared and packaged foods under
the Philip Morris corporate umbrella contributed to overall revenue
growth. These products included General Foods' Maxwell House coffee
and Kool-Aid powdered beverages and Kraft's Cheez Whiz, Velveeta,
and packaged dinners.
   Other Philip Morris holdings that produced revenue gains were
Oscar Mayer Foods, including the Louis Rich turkey business, and
Miller Brewing Co.
   American Brands reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter
earnings, due largely to a strong performance from its tobacco unit.
   The Greenwich, Conn.-based company earned $172 million, or $1.80
a share, on revenue of $3.24 billion in the first quarter, compared
with a profit of $151 million, or $1.40 a share, on revenue of
$3.13 billion during the same period last year.
   William J. Alley, American Brands' chairman and chief executive
officer, attributed the record rise in per-share earnings in part
to a 17.1-million-share stock buyback, which cut the number of
outstanding shares by 11 percent.
   In addition, Alley said, the company's ``core tobacco business
continues to generate sustained profit growth, both domestically
and internationally.''
   American Brands' domestic tobacco subsidiary, American Tobacco
Co., makes Carlton, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Tareyton and Malibu
cigarettes.
   American Brands' other operations include life insurance,
distilled spirits, office products, hardware and home improvement
products.

<HEAD>Battle Between CNW Corp. and Japonica Partners Heats Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-rumored acquisition battle spilled over
Wednesday as Japonica Partners disclosed intentions to acquire CNW
Corp. in a letter that asked shareholders to replace the management
of the railroad holding company with a slate of its own.
   ``I guess you could call this hostile,'' CNW spokesman James
Foote said. ``Throughout this whole campaign, they have not made an
offer to us nor have they indicated they have financing for such a
deal.
   ``Now, they apparently want to become directors so that if they
do make an offer, they would be making it to themselves.''
   Countered Japonica spokesman Frederic Spar: ``They had better
understand that when a group of quality people make a statement as
blunt as this, it should be taken seriously.''
   In a letter to shareholders, New York-based Japonica said it is
CNW's largest shareholder, owning 8.8 percent of the Chicago
company's approximately 16.4 million outstanding shares.
   Japonica said it intends to acquire CNW at a ``substantial
premium'' over the $31-per-share offer put together by CNW
management and the investment group Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen.
That proposal fell through last May.
   The letter criticizes CNW management for refusing to give
Japonica the same consideration it gave its own bid last year.
   Spar declined to be more specific about whether Japonica's plans
for an acquisition would result from a merger or tender offer or
some other arrangement, or how much more than $31 per share would
be offered.
   As for financing, he said Japonica was ``evaluating'' several
proposals.
   CNW Corp. stock climbed 37{ cents Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange to close at $40.
   CNW's principal subsidiary is the Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co., which operates a nine-state, 6,000-mile freight
railroad with 8,500 employees. CNW also has real estate holdings
and operates Chicago-area commuter rail lines. It earned $81
million on revenues of $995.4 million last year.
   The Japonica letter contends CNW's board has approved excessive
compensation levels and an ``inappropriate'' golden-parachute
package for CNW's senior management in case of a takeover.
   Japonica also said it would consider selling CNW's real estate,
excess equipment and the commuter lines.
   Japonica's proposed slate includes C. Howard Hardesty, former
president and chief executive officer of Purolator Courier Corp.,
as its chairman-designate.
   In a letter to shareholders last month, CNW Chairman Robert
Schmiege urged support for the company's slate at the May 16
stockholders meeting.
   Analysts attributed a recent runup in the stock to the
escalating war of words between Japonica and CNW management.
   In a related development, CNW Corp. announced Wednesday that it
had filed an appeal in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia seeking to force Japonica Partners to disclose its
plans for CNW and the identity of its investors.
   A U.S. District Court judge in Delaware, where CNW is
incorporated, recently denied CNW's request for a preliminary
injunction to force Japonica to provide such information.
   CNW also announced that its directors approved a dividend of 10
cents a share, payable July 14.

<TEXT>
   AMR Corp., parent company of American
Airlines, reported Wednesday a 47.7 percent jump in first-quarter
profit, partly due to increased traffic as passengers looked for an
alternative to Eastern Airlines.
   Net earnings were $101 million, or $1.60 per share, on revenues
of $2.45 billion during the quarter. That compares with earnings of
$68.4 million, or $1.12 per share, on revenues of $1.97 billion in
the same quarter last year.
   The first-quarter 1989 earnings included a $14.1 million gain
from the sale of certain property rights, the company said.
   American's load factor at Raleigh-Durham airport in North
Carolina jumped from 63 percent in last year's first quarter to
71.2 percent this year, while in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the factor
rose from 70.3 to 81.4, AMR Chairman Robert Crandall said. Both
locations were Eastern strongholds.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection March 9 after
its Machinists union members went on strike, crippling the airline.
   American's revenue passenger miles, a key industry statistic,
rose 9.7 percent in the quarter, from 14.77 million in the year-ago
period to 16.2 million.

<HEAD>Bergner Sweetens Deal For Department Store Chain Carson Pirie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   P.A. Bergner &amp; Co., rebuffed last week in a
takeover bid for Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co., sweetened the deal
Wednesday by offering $24 per share for the Chicago-based retailer.
   ``We remain convinced that a business combination involving your
department stores and those of Bergner's represents a sound
business fit,'' Alan R. Anderson, chairman of P.A. Bergner, said in
a letter to Carson Pirie.
   Carson Pirie, which owns 33 department stores in Illinois, Iowa,
Indiana and Minnesota, last week rejected a $20-per-share offer
from P.A. Bergner, a Swiss-owned department store chain with
headquarters in Milwaukee.
   Carson Pirie stock jumped by $1.62{ to close at $23.37{
Wednesday in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   ``We are prepared to pay $24 net in cash for each outstanding
share of Carson's common stock,'' Anderson wrote. ``This price
represents an extraordinary premium over the recent trading history
of Carson's common stock.''
   Anderson said the offer expires April 28.
   Carson Pirie issued a statement saying its directors ``would
review the proposal ... in due course.''
   In a letter to Carson Pirie directors, Anderson said he enclosed
a copy of a letter from Swiss Bank Corp. confirming the bank would
provide P.A. Bergner with the money necessary to acquire the
outstanding shares and to refinance Carson Pirie's debt.
   P.A. Bergner operates 31 department stores in Illinois and
Wisconsin.
   Carson Pirie lost $38.8 million in the fiscal year that ended
Jan. 31, much of it from its catalog operations. Besides department
stores, Carson Pirie owns 388 County Seat speciality stores in
Midwest and Sunbelt states and 23 Arcadia stores in Chicago.

   NCR Corp. shareholders Wednesday rejected a
proposal to entirely withdraw the company's operations from South
Africa.
   NCR's board of directors had urged shareholders to vote against
the proposal at Wednesday's annual meeting. The company announced
April 4 that it plans to sell its South African subsidiary and
market its products through a distributor in that nation.
   Charles Russ III, NCR's vice president and secretary, wrote
shareholders a letter saying that if the planned South African
transaction cannot be completed, there is no assurance that the
board could enter into another agreement that would similarly serve
shareholder interests.
   Former Chairman William S. Anderson retired from the board
following Wednesday's meeting. Anderson, who reached the company's

appointment as NCR's president in 1972.

   Motorola Inc., citing patent violations,
has filed complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission
and in federal court to stop sales of some portable and mobile
cellular telephones, the company said Wednesday.
   ``We expect our competition to respect Motorola's hard-won
patent position,'' said Motorola Vice President Robert N.
Weisshappel.
   He said talks with Nokia Corp. of Finland and Tandy Mobira
Communications Corp. of Korea had been fruitless.
   The infringements allow competitors to sell products at unfairly
low prices, resulting in substantial injury to Motorola and the
U.S. cellular telephone industry, Motorola said.
   Motorola seeks permanent relief from the ITC in Washington, as
well as a temporary exclusion order and a temporary
cease-and-desist order to halt imports of cellular telephones,
primarily from Korea, that it says infringe upon seven of its
patents.
   In the court action, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
Motorola seeks a permanent injunction and unspecified monetary
damages, citing infringement on nine patents.
   Named in the ITC action are Nokia Corp. of Helsinki, Finland;
Nokia-Mobira Oy of Salo, Finland; Nokia Inc. of Basking Ridge,
N.J.; Nokia-Mobira Inc. of Largo, Fla.; Tandy Mobira Communications
Corp. of Korea; Tandy Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas; and A&amp;A
International of Fort Worth, Texas.
   Named as defendants in the court action are Nokia Corp.,
Nokia-Mobira Inc., Tandy Mobira Communications Corp. and Tandy Corp.
   ``We haven't seen the exact complaints,'' Tandy spokesman Ed
Juge said. ``We've been talking to them through legal counsel for
several months. Without knowing exactly what's involved, it's
impossible to give relevant comment.''
   A phone call placed to Nokia's New Jersey operation after office
hours Wednesday went unanswered.
   Motorola is one of the world's leading manufacturers of
electronics equipment, systems and components for world markets.
Its products include two-way radios, pagers, cellular telephone
systems, defense and aerospace electronics, and information
processing and handling equipment.

   Wells Fargo Bank announced Wednesday it
will expand the international services available to its customers
through an agreement with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
   At the same time, the San Francisco-based banking concern will
dispose of its four remaining overseas offices in Seoul, Korea;
Singapore; Hong Kong; and Tokyo.
   In an effort to concentrate on its core market in California,
Wells Fargo has been reducing its direct involvement in overseas
activity except for the area of trade financing.
   HongkongBank will serve Wells Fargo customers outside the United
States and will take over its business and office in Hong Kong. It
also will help dispose of Wells Fargo's Tokyo office, the company
said.
   The Los Angeles and San Francisco offices of HongkongBank will
also refer their retail banking business to Wells Fargo. However,
the offices will retain their corporate customers in California.
   Wells Fargo Chairman Carl E. Reichardt termed the agreement with
HongkongBank ``the first of its kind for a major U.S. bank and a
forerunner of how global banking will be done in the 1990s.''

<TEXT>
   Rising interest rates have caught up with American homeowners
and are pinching the pockets of the 12 million households with
adjustable-rate mortgages.
   For many of them, springtime '89 will mean a second annual hike
in mortgage payments _ 20 percent over a year ago on average _
since that's when the bulk of U.S. homes are usually sold and
mortgages originated.
   This season also marks the first real test of interest-sensitive
adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs as they're called, in an era of
tightening credit. A government report issued earlier this week
showed a 5.4 percent drop in housing starts last month, evidence
that rising rates are already having a major impact on the economy.
Loan delinquencies could follow.
   ``We haven't seen this before,'' said Robert Van Order, chief
economist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co., or Freddie Mac.
``ARMs became popular in the early 1980s at the national level
after rates started to come down. This is the first period of
rising rates.''
   Monthly payments on a typical $100,000 ARM taken out in April
1988 are likely to rise at least $150 starting next month since
most ARMs are tied to an index of one-year Treasury notes, which
have risen about 2.5 percentage points from a year ago.
   Interest rates, particularly short-term, have gone up over the
past two years in reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision to
keep a tighter rein on credit to prevent the economy from
overheating and keep inflation in check.
   Economists say they've already seen signs that that strategy is
working, and they predict that interest rates will ease by the end
of the year. The sharp jump in payments of widely used ARMs will
also help to temper economic growth because it will limit many
homeowners' discretionary income, they said.
   ``People will find there's a lot of things they can do without.
But they will want to hold onto their most worthwhile possession:
their homes,'' said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors.
   Twenty percent of all the 58 million owner-occupied homes in the
United States are financed with ARMs, or about $800 billion of the
$2.2 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt, according to industry
estimates.
   So far in 1989, ARMs have made up an estimated 55 percent of all
mortgages granted. Economists, though, expect that level to decline
because short-term rates have risen at a faster clip than
longer-term rates, making ARMs far less attractive.
   The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortage averaged
11.09 percent in April, up from 11.03 percent in March, while the
initial rate on an ARM averaged 9.40 this month, up from 9.09
percent the previous month.
   The typical ARM holder is someone who is relatively young and
expects to be moving up, as well as on, within a few years. Many
people who take out these kind of loans also expect interest rates
to be heading south.
   ``The adjustable-rate mortgage has ... kept the housing market
going at reasonably healthy levels for quite some time,'' said
Richard W. Peach, deputy chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America. ``Consumers have always been aware of the
risks inherent with adjustable-rate mortgages.
   ``Now the chickens have come home to roost and unfortunately we
have seen a worst case scenario for a borrower with an ARM.''
   Homeowners who were drawn into the market by the artificially
low ``teaser rates'' for the first year have seen the biggest jump
in payments.
   A homeowner who got a $100,000 ARM with a teaser rate of 6.5
percent two years ago would have had initial monthly payments of
$819.46. In 1988 the rate likely went up 2 percentage points to 8.5
percent, lifting the monthly mortgage payments to $986.11, or 20
percent from the first year.
   This year the rate is likely to go up another 2 percentage
points to 10.5 percent, lifting the monthly mortgage payments to
$1,152.78, up about $333.33, or 41 percent from the first year.
   ``Mortgage payments have gone up a fair amount, but I don't
think we're experiencing a crisis in the marketplace,'' said
Stephen Ashley, president of Sibley Corp., a Rochester, N.Y.,
mortgage company. ``I think we have seen a situation where the
home-buying public is now much more aware of the risks associated
with ARMs.''
   He and other lenders say that many consumers have been choosing
fixed-rate mortgages, or adjustable loans that convert to a fixed
rate mortgage during some period of the loan.
