   A victim of last week's bridge collapse over
the Great Miami River was identified Thursday but efforts to
recover other bodies were hampered by inadequate equipment and
strong river currents, officials said.
   Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis Jr. identified the victim as
Helen C. Zorn, 52, of nearby Green Township. Her decomposed body
was recovered Tuesday from surfaced debris, Leis said.
   Still missing was her daughter, Terry Siemon, 27, who was
believed to have been with Mrs. Zorn as the two were driving over
the bridge when it collapsed last Friday afternoon, said sheriff's
spokesman Frank Weikel.
   No other bodies, or either of two submerged vehicles believed to
have fallen from the bridge, were recovered Thursday, said Lt.
Chris Robertson, one of five police divers on the search team.
   In another development, a sheriff's deputy directing traffic at
the bridge site died at a Cincinnati hospital after suffering a
heart attack late Thursday afternoon. He was identified as Sgt.
Robert Mondary, 51, a 21-year veteran.
   Robertson said police divers were frustrated by strong
underwater currents and little or no visibility underwater,
reducing divers to feeling in the darkness for objects.
   ``We're fighting current. It's like trying to hang onto the back
of a boat,'' Robertson told reporters.
   A crane's grappling hook broke off and was lost underwater in
the murky river Thursday afternoon, prompting officials to call off
the rest of the day's recovery efforts at the site 12 miles west of
Cincinnati.
   Police are unsure how many people were swept into the river. But
based on eyewitness reports, police believe two vehicles and as
many as five people fell in when a 100-foot section of the bridge
collapsed.
   The one-lane temporary bridge, opened to traffic in December
while workmen built a nearby replacement for a 94-year-old bridge,
collapsed during rush hour while taking a pounding from large
debris in a strong current swelled by heavy rains.

   The daily ``shape-up'' of longshoremen looking
for jobs so vividly portrayed in the film ``On The Waterfront'' is
going the way of silent movies. But in a talky way.
   A new phone-in system is taking its place.
   ``It's the end of an era for that type of hiring of
longshoremen, something that's been in existence for 36 years,''
said Jerome J. Klied, deputy director of the Waterfront Commission
of New York Harbor, as the commission announced the change Thursday.
   ``On the Waterfront'' _ which won four Academy Awards in 1954 _
depicted corruption, part of which was the daily so-called shape-up
on the piers. Once the men gathered for work, the jobs, in
reel-life and real-life, were passed out on the basis of kickbacks
and friendships, among other corruptions.
   ``It was a very degrading form of employment,'' Klied said.
   In 1953, the Waterfront Commission was created to end that
freewheeling system.
   Now, the workers get their assignments by telephone the day
before they work. Only unemployed longshoremen show up each day in
one of three employment centers hoping to get the 50 slots left
vacant by absentees.
   Under the system that goes into effect Tuesday, employers will
factor in the vacancies and call up the unemployed the day before
an assignment.

   Ninth-grader Kevin Wooten's perfect
attendance at school this year paid a dividend on the last day of
class: a new car. The problem is he's too young to drive.
   Murray County High School Principal Mickey McNeill announced
early in the school year that students with perfect attendance each
month would have a chance at winning a car at year's end.
   Those who missed no school all year got nine extra chances at
winning.
   Wooten got the keys to a new Chevrolet Sprint Metro to kick off
his summer vacation, thanks to contributions from businesspeople,
individuals and a Chevrolet dealer.
   But Wooten won't be old enough to drive the car _ 16 _ until
September.
   ``I think they didn't believe it would be a reality,'' said
McNeill, who added that he hasn't decided whether to use the same
incentive next year. ``But we've made believers of them now.''
   He said Thursday the car incentive was an idea to interest
students in coming to school who would otherwise have poor
attendance records.
   McNeill said the school wanted to try ``positive rewards rather
than punishment'' as an incentive for good attendance.
   ``We came up with what every kid wants _ a car,'' McNeill said.

   Tina Brown didn't win big playing bingo,
but she still had something to show for the night. A baby girl.
   Mrs. Brown, 25, and eight months pregnant with her second child,
was returning from an evening of bingo in Delphos, Ohio, on
Wednesday when she started feeling labor pains.
   Her friend Minnie Upshaw pulled their car to the side of U.S. 30
about five miles east of New Haven.
   Rookie Indiana State Police Trooper Lance Garver pulled over to
see what was wrong. Minutes later, Garver helped deliver a 4-pound
baby girl.
   Mother and child were doing fine Thursday at Parkview Memorial
Hospital in Fort Wayne.
   ``I'm really grateful for him,'' Mrs. Brown said. ``He stuck
right in there and did a great job.''
   She hasn't named the child, though Garver made a suggestion.
   ``He told me to name it Trooper,'' Mrs. Brown said.

   NBC News ``Today'' anchor Bryant Gumbel, on a
dare from weatherman Willard Scott, showed some on-air versatility.
   He gave the weather report.
   The challenge began when Gumbel started kidding Scott on the air
Thursday for arriving with only a second to spare before the 8:30
a.m. forecast.
   ``I was going to vamp for a little while until you managed to
join us,'' Gumbel said. ``Then I thought we'd kind of do the local
(weather) at the front.''
   Scott said he would give $100 to Gumbel's favorite charity if
Gumbel gave the weather report.
   Gumbel chose the United Negro College Fund and then did the
weather report, starting off in grand Willard Scott-style with
birthday greetings for two viewers in South Dakota and Kansas.
   Scott and Gumbel had a feud recently after Gumbel sent a memo to
NBC brass criticizing Scott for making birthday greetings.

<HEAD>Bush: Greater Democracy in Soviet Union Would Lessen Military Threat</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: ADDS overline; EDITS throughout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its allies would no
longer need to aim at ``containing'' the Soviet Union militarily if
the Soviet Union achieves significantly greater democracy,
President Bush is quoted as saying.
   Instead, the president told interviewers from The Washington
Post, U.S. concern would shift to ``the economic side of things.''
   Bush was interviewed in London on Thursday. The interview was
published in Friday editions of the newspaper.
   Sounding themes he has emphasized in recent speeches, Bush said
the Soviet Union ``might well be in the state of radical change.''
   ``And as this change asserts itself, and as they genuinely
change, our doctrine need no longer be containing a militarily
aggressive Soviet Union,'' the president said.
   Greater freedom in the Soviet Union means more freedom and less
rigid boundaries in all of Europe, he said: ``As those things
happen, the role of NATO shifts, our own role shifts, from the main
emphasis on deterrence to an emphasis on the economic side of
things.''
   Bush emphasized he did not believe that freedom had fully
arrived in the Soviet Union and ``we have got to keep our guard
up'' until then.
   In a separate Post interview in Washington, Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney said if Bush's proposals for armed forces reductions
in Europe are accepted, U.S. land forces might wind up stressing
lighter equipment for easier deployment to world trouble spots.
   Cheney said the proposed ceiling of 275,000 troops for both the
United States and the Soviet Union in Europe might raise other
questions, such as whether ships would be better than aircraft for
reinforcement from the United States in war.
   Though the proposal makes military sense, Cheney said he was
worried that Congress would try to double or triple the president's
proposed reduction of 30,000 U.S. troops: ``Maybe eventually we can
talk about those numbers, but not now.''
   Bush will visit Poland and Hungary this summer, but he said he
did not believe talks with the Soviets about the Soviet allies in
Eastern Europe were appropriate. ``That is not my concept,'' he
said.
   On the massive pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, where
Bush represented the United States in 1974 and 1975, Bush said he
had learned ``don't judge events in China by the headlines of the
moment'' but ``I don't think the Chinese want to put the democratic
genie back in the bottle or can put it back in the bottle. I don't
think the Soviets can.''
   He said Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev had told him
``elements in the United States'' did not want the new Soviet
``restructuring'' policies to succeed and ``I said, Not so. I don't
know of any credible elements that don't want it to succeed.''
   Gorbachev apparently has stopped shipping weapons to Nicaragua,
as he has said, but other Soviet-bloc countries are doing it, Bush
said.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Says New Legislature Should Have Authority Over Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of the KGB said Thursday that the
newly elected Soviet legislature should have have full authority
over his agency, and use U.S. congressional oversight as its model,
The New York Times reported.
   Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, in his first interview with Western
reporters, said the Supreme Soviet would probably create a
commission similar to the congressional committees charged with
overseeing intelligence activities in the United States, the Times
reported in its Friday editions.
   ``We are decidedly in favor of this,'' he said. ``And as far as
the creation of a commission is concerned, I think we'll borrow
some of the experience of the Americans.''
   Included in the legislature's powers would be the authority to
approve the appointment of the KGB chairman, Kryuchkov said.
   Human rights activists have said the KGB should be accountable
to the new legislature in order to protect rights and curb police
powers.
   Kryuchkov, who was appointed last October, spoke with reporters
a day after a member of the new congress, Yuri P. Vlasov, charged
that the KGB ``exercises all-embracing control over society, over
each individual.''
   The frankness of the accusation shocked other legislators and
millions listening on radio and television broadcasts.
   The KGB is technically overseen by the Council of Ministers, the
administrative branch of government, but in practice it has been
virtually independent.

<HEAD>Ministers Reject Protectionism in Swipe at Washington</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conference of 24 nations on Thursday rejected
protectionist trade policies in an implicit condemnation of the
United States.
   Officials of nations belonging to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development declared their determination to
dismantle trade barriers erected by individual nations in favor of
a stronger international trading system.
   In a communique issued at the end of the annual meeting, the
members said they would continue to fight inflation, cut
unemployment, and improve protection of the environment.
   The meeting, which brought together ministers of economy,
finance, and trade from member countries, provided one barometer of
the main issues that may come up at the annual economic summit of
the seven industrialized democracies, to be held in Paris on July
14-16.
   The most talked about issue at the meeting ending Thursday was
trade, with many countries voicing concern about a U.S. move last
week singling out Japan, India and Brazil as unfair trading
partners.
   Under U.S. trade law, Washington can now take retaliatory
actions in 12 or 18 months if the countries do not remove the
restrictions they are accused of imposing.
   At the trade meeting, Japan vigorously attacked the U.S. measure
and won support from some European nations and Canada in getting
strong language on free trade into the final communique.
   In their final statement Thursday, the ministers said they
wanted to ``express their determination to halt and reverse all
such protectionist tendencies ... and avoid any discriminatory or
autonomous actions.''
   Despite the implied criticism of Washington, U.S Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady put a positive face on the meeting. He
insisted ``there was basic agreement on fundamental issues.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said the Bush
Administration remained committed to joint trade practices.
   She noted U.S. law does not require retaliation against
purported offenders but did not rule out such action.
   In recommendations for specific countries, the final communique
also said priorities for the United States should remain ``to
contain inflationary pressures'' and cut the federal budget deficit.
   Industrial nations formed the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development to foster international economic growth
and cooperation.

   Boris Yeltsin is a vocal critic of the Communist
Party leadership during a time of momentous change in the Soviet
Union and has become a voice for millions of the discontented and
disillusioned. Here is a report on the Yeltsin phenomenon.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mechanic, basking in the noonday sun near his
friend's vending cart on Moscow's old Arbat, summed up the secret
that has made Communist Party bad boy Boris N. Yeltsin the hero of
millions.
   ``If the party bosses are against him, then we're for him; it's
that simple,'' said Yuri Chaplygin.
   Maverick, martyr, demagogue, populist _ Yeltsin's image has
shifted with his changing political fortunes. But he holds a trump
card: backing from millions of supporters who relish his open
battles with party leaders and cheer his calls to ease the brutal
daily grind of Soviet life.
   Yeltsin's speech this week at the Congress of People's Deputies
showed him at his best, his throaty bass booming out accusations
and demands in simple phrases, his doughy face set in a
characteristic snarl, his strapping, erect figure topped by a
smooth sweep of silver hair.
   Yeltsin told the Congress that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
was responsible for the nation's continuing economic decline, said
he was accumulating too much power and that the new parliament
should take over political power from the Communist Party.
   But the Soviet public has also seen Yeltsin when he was down,
crushed after he made a daring 1987 speech criticizing the slow
pace of Gorbachev's reforms at a closed-door party meeting.
   That speech included harsh words for Politburo foe Yegor K.
Ligachev and brought Yeltsin a scathing reprimand from his former
mentor Gorbachev and vitriolic attacks from other party officials
who accused him of dealing ``a stab in the back'' to economic
reform.
   The criticism of Yeltsin was published in the press, he was
stripped of his post as Moscow party chief and soon afterward
hospitalized for heart trouble.
   Word went out that the 58-year-old Yeltsin had been broken.
   Ultimately, however, adversity and the open opposition of the
Communist Party apparatus only increased Yeltsin's popularity.
   ``People identify with Yeltsin,'' the weekly Moscow News wrote
in April in a full-page story headlined ``The Boris Yeltsin
Phenomenon.''
   ``He's a victim of dislike on the part of higher-ups _ who of us
hasn't been in the same position?'' the weekly said. ``And he is
being slighted for refusing to seek their approval _ who hasn't
dreamed of doing that?''
   Yeltsin became a victim, said Alexander Poroshkin, a Moscow
street artist. ``And Russians love a victim, he's like a martyred
saint.''
   Yeltsin's reputation began to swell when he was still Moscow
party chief. He chopped the local party apparatus, campaigned in
stores and on TV to improve food supplies and spoke out against
special privileges for the government and party elite.
   At the 1986 Communist Party Congress, just three months after
taking the Moscow post, Yeltsin already was firing salvos at the
party bureaucracy, demanding an end to the perquisites top
officials enjoy and saying no leader should be above criticism.
   For many Muscovites, who watch their leaders rocket by in sleek
limousines while they stand in line to buy soap, sugar and
countless other scarce items, Yeltsin's borscht-in-every-pot
message has immediate appeal.
   ``Yeltsin wants to give what everyone wants, to raise the
standard of living and get us what we don't have,'' said a
middle-aged warehouse worker standing in a long line to buy pickles.
   ``He wants sharp changes, and that's what we need,'' Chaplygin
said. ``If you want a revolution, it should be the real thing.''
   In his campaign to win a seat in the Congress, Yeltsin linked
his call for immediate improvements in the average Soviet's living
standard with daring denunciations of the privileges granted top
state and party officials.
   Voters responded with a landslide. Yeltsin was swept into office
with almost 90 percent of the vote, obtaining the ballots of more
than 5 million Muscovites and crushing the establishment candidate
who opposed him for a Moscow seat.
   For many ordinary Muscovites, the choice was clear.
   The former construction engineer set a personal example by
refusing the privileges of rank, though he still is a member of the
party's policy-making Central Committee and was chauffeured to
election rallies in a limousine.
   His candidacy got an extra boost 10 days before the election
when the party's Central Committee formed a special commission to
investigate allegations that Yeltsin had been espousing views that
clashed with the party line.
   The tactic backfired badly. Voters saw heightened persecution
from above, and a pre-election rally attended by thousands
condemned the commission and vowed to stand by Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin's support also stems from the convenient position of
``being a shadow leader, a critic of whatever is being done
poorly'' without having to run reforms himself, the Moscow News
said.
   He's not a ``main dish,'' progressive editor Vitaly Korotich of
Ogonyok magazine has said. But Korotich says Yeltsin can fulfill a
useful role in the country's legislature.
   Despite his tough-talking frankness, Yeltsin has expressly
refrained from presenting himself as a direct rival to Gorbachev.
But he has done nothing to conceal the animosity between himself
and Ligachev.
   He has also publicly questioned Raisa Gorbachev's active role in
her husband's political life, playing to a widespread dislike for a
woman who won't accept a traditional behind-the-scences role.
   ``Yeltsin has brought big-time politics down from the Olympian
heights and put them at the feet of rank-and-file citizens,''
political analyst Vitaly Tretyakov wrote in Moscow News.
   The question now, Poroshkin said, is whether Yeltsin can put his
popularity to use to get his ideas made into official policy.
``It's like a player at a casino who has won a lot of chips but
hasn't cashed them in yet,'' he said.
   Actually, Yeltsin already reaped some benefit from his popular
support after his failure at the Congress on Saturday to gain a
seat on the new full-time national legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   Tens of thousands of people chanted ``Yeltsin! Yeltsin!'' at a
mass rally in a Moscow stadium parking lot Sunday, and called for
another deputy to give his seat up to Yeltsin.
   Their wish was granted the next day with Gorbachev's backing.
   Support for Yeltsin at such recent rallies in Moscow has
appeared intensely personal, with backers wearing his button-sized
portrait and chanting his name. But some say they like him not for
who he is, but for what he embodies.
   ``No one loves him for himself, it's just that for the first
time, an alternative has appeared,'' Poroshkin said.

<HEAD>Senator Jousts With Pentagon Cookie Monster at Procurement Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army marches on its stomach, Napoleon
supposedly remarked, but senators say a 15-page set of
specifications for government issue cookies may be carrying the
concern with rations too far.
   The specifications, showing the Pentagon pays equal attention to
chocolate chips and computer chips, were read aloud Thursday at a
hearing by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on
oversight of government management.
   The subcommittee was looking into the strict specifications for
commercial and off-the-shelf products, along with excessive
requirements, that have turned away would-be contractors.
   ``The cookies shall be well-baked,'' said Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine, reading just before lunch from the guidelines for
chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. ``They shall be browned on the
bottom surface and outer edges, but not appreciably browned on the
top surface.
   ``They shall be wholly intact, free of checks or cracks. ... The
cookies shall be tender and crisp with an appetizing flavor, free
of a burnt or scorched flavor.''
   Specifications for sandwich cookies require ``each cookie shall
consist of two round base cakes with a layer of filling between
them. ... The base cakes shall have been uniformly well-baked with
a color ranging from not lighter than chip 27885 or darker than
chip 13711.
   ``The color comparisons shall be made under ... sky daylight
with the objects held in such a way as to avoid specular refracture
(glossiness).
   ``The filling shall be centered so that it does not protrude
beyond the perimeter of the base cakes.''
   ``Would Mrs. Fields comply?'' Cohen teasingly asked Greg
Saunders, the Pentagon's assistant for commercial acquisition.
   ``I suspect it would be too high quality a cookie,'' Saunders
replied.
   Saunders defended specification, saying the department has to
have a number of specifications for food items because many remain
on the shelf for up to five years.
   On an even more serious note, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald
Atwood promised to review the specifications that limit purchases
of cheaper commercial products.
   ``I can only pledge to you that with the staff at the Defense
Department we'll review some 50,000 specifications ... in great
detail with the idea in mind of making use of commercial products
wherever they're available,'' said the former vice chairman of
General Motors Corp.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, said
recent legislation that requires the Pentagon to purchase, whenever
possible, products already sold commercially or used by the
government has had little effect.
   ``The real problem is that despite the 1986 law, the Pentagon
remains hooked on the old way of doing business,'' Levin said.
   Levin also noted that a recent study by the Center for Strategic
and International Studies found that the number of companies
competing for defense contracts has dropped from 118,000 to 38,000
over a five-year period.
   Atwood described one example of strict specification. Government
inspectors at a General Electric production line for military
aircraft engines nearly equaled the number of workers, while
employees building the same engines for commercial use were not
scrutinized.
   ``It doesn't make sense to have that wide a disparity,'' Atwood
said.
   The deputy defense secretary attributed the high number of
specifications to the publicity surrounding last summer's ``Ill
Wind'' investigation into alleged Pentagon fraud and corruption in
the acquisition process.
   ``There has been and is a natural tendency on people's part to
bend over backwards to make sure it couldn't happen in this
particular procurement,'' Atwood said. ``And we do see a little
overreaction because of the recent visibility.''
   But Atwood cautioned against legislative steps that could harm
the department.
   ``You can think of any commercial product that if it's loosely
worded some organization can meet that loosely worded specification
and we're all the worse off for it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   If you're looking to buy a new home, the decline in interest
rates over the past few weeks could open a few doors.
   Economists say an improved inflation outlook and stronger dollar
have helped reverse a stubborn upward trend in rates that began two
years ago and has sent the once-vibrant housing industry into a
slump.
   ``Many people out there who wouldn't be able to buy a home can
now qualify at the lower rates,'' Richard W. Peach, deputy chief
economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said
Thursday.
   At the same time, rates on some certificates of deposit have
fallen, while changes in other types of consumer interest charges
such as bank auto loans and credit cards have been mixed.
   Many experts predict interest rates will continue easing the
rest of the year as the U.S. economy slows and as foreigners,
attracted by a firm dollar, pump money into U.S. financial
investments. Some predict fixed-rate mortgages could drop to 10
percent before the end of the year.
   Fixed-rate loans have dropped most steeply over the last two
months, dropping below 11 percent in tandem with declining
long-term rates in the credit markets.
   But adjustable rate mortages, which are tied to an index of
one-year Treasury notes, have shown only a slight drop, because
short-term rates remain comparably high. That stems from the
Federal Reserve's decision to keep a tigher rein on credit to fight
inflation.
   The average rate on the first year of an ARM was 9.18 percent
the last week in May, down from 9.28 percent the previous week,
according to the latest bank survey of the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. The rate averaged 9.40 percent in April.
   Freddie Mac said the average rate on fixed 30-year mortgages
fell to a five-month low of 10.5 percent the last week in May, down
from 10.69 percent the week before. Just two months ago, that same
loan averaged 11.22 percent, a nearly four-year high, and in May
1988 it averaged 10.46 percent, it said.
   The decline of nearly three-quarters of a percentage point in
30-year, fixed-rate mortgages over the past two months could mean
significant savings in comparing monthly mortgage payments.
   Homebuyers, for example, who got a $100,000 conventional loan at
the 11.22 percent rate are paying $972 a month in interest and
principal. Those who took out a mortgage last week at 10.5 percent
pay $915, or $684 less a year, for a 6 percent difference.
   That could mean the difference between qualifying for a mortgage
and having to put home-buying plans on hold, for some. The rule of
thumb is that monthly mortgage payments not exceed 25 percent of
net household income.
   ``For every half percentage point (increase or decrease),
another half a million people get in the housing market or out of
the housing market,'' said Ronnie J. Wynn, president of Montgomery,
Ala.-based Colonial Mortgage Co., one of the nation's largest
mortgage companies.
   Wynn said business is brisker these days as people rush to
exploit the break in rates. Loan applications are running about 20
percent higher than a year ago, compared with a 10 percent drop in
applications during April, he said.
   Stephen Ashley, president of the Rochester, N.Y.-based mortgage
banker Sibley Corp., said his business was slower than last year
but he expects it to pick up this summer.
   ``I think that the drop in rates has been positive in terms of
bringing a greater number of homebuyers into the market ... (But) I
don't want to represent it as being a land rush,'' he said.
   While fixed-rate mortgages have come down significantly, other
consumer interest charges haven't.
   A 48-month bank loan for a new car averages 12.56 percent, up
from 12.54 percent a month ago and 11.73 percent at the beginning
of the year, according to the North Palm Beach, Fla., publication
Bank Rate Monitor.
   Bank credit cards average 18.13 percent, up from 18.09 percent a
month ago and 18.03 percent earlier this year, Bank Rate Monitor
reported.
   For savers, rate changes have been mixed. The yield on a
one-year certificate of deposit has an average yield of 9.28
percent, down from 9.51 percent a month ago, according to the
publication.
   Money market accounts yielded an average 6.62 percent in the
week ended Wednesday, unchanged from the previous month, it said.

   The euphoria and even the self-congratulation are
subsiding. And now President Bush's ambitious arms control
initiatives will be put to the test.
   Indeed, as Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Thursday,
the ball is in the Soviets' court and ``a response by them is now
clearly called for.''
   Bush's proposals for ceilings on troops, tanks, combat aircraft
and attack helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers
refine what NATO put on the bargaining table in Vienna in March.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev responded last month with
his own blueprint for drastic cuts.
   But Bush's proposals change the picture in the East-West talks
again. For the first time, for instance, NATO is willing to
negotiate over combat airplanes.
   The Soviets, presumably, will have to deal with that issue.
Defining what is a combat craft is difficult. And Gorbachev is
bound to have his own version of what kind of aerial cutbacks
should be made.
   The Soviet leader also may push for reductions in Western naval
forces. And it would be amazing if he did not try to trim or even
eliminate British and French troop concentrations in West Germany.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in an initial
reaction Wednesday in Paris, said those 100,000 forces could
complicate the quest for an accord.
   This had echoes of the fight two years ago over Pershing
missiles in West Germany that were partly under U.S. control.
   It threatened to hold up a treaty to ban U.S. and Soviet
medium-range missiles.
   The Reagan administration argued the negotiations did not
involve West Germany. Finally, there was a compromise in which the
West Germans volunteered to destroy the missiles.
   Bush, outlining his plan in Brussels, said it should be possible
to complete a treaty in six months to a year.
   It would be carried out by 1992 or 1993, at the latest, under
the Bush timetable.
   Shevardnadze said he was ``pessimistic'' about Bush's timetable.
   Baker was not about to contradict his boss, especially on the
president's best week in office.
   ``It was optimistic, but not unrealistic,'' Baker said.
   But he acknowledged there are lots of questions for NATO to work
out before the proposal is put on the table in Vienna.
   These, he said, include finding ways to verify that the
reductions are carried out and dealing with the equipment the
United States would like to keep stored in Europe after tens of
thousands of troops are withdrawn.
   Baker also said there are questions about the extent to which
troops must be demobilized and deactivated.
   Responding to Shevardnadze on British and French troops, he
said, ``I suppose we will have an interest in knowing what happens
to other Warsaw Pact troops other than Soviet troops.''
   The pace of arms control has quickened since Gorbachev took
power in 1985.
   The United States and the Soviet Union signed an unprecedented
treaty in 1987 to destroy all their medium-range nuclear missiles.
   By pushing hard on a number of fronts, the Soviet leader has
forced Bush to abandon his cautious stance and come up with his own
wide-ranging plan.
   But that does not mean the problems of pursuing disarmament go
away.
   Just remember: East and West negotiated for 15 years to reduce
their forces in Central Europe. The talks eventually collapsed.
   And now NATO and the Warsaw Pact are dealing with all of Europe
and a much wider range of weapons.

   There were those who said George Bush would never
get along as famously with Margaret Thatcher as Ronald Reagan did.
   It appears they were wrong.
   The British prime minister and the new American president
showered each other with praise at a formal dinner at 10 Downing
Street on Thursday night and regaled the celebrity-studded audience
with anecdotes.
   Bush, on the final night of his first trip to Europe as
president, stayed a half-hour later than planned, and said before
driving off, ``It was a wonderful trip.''
   Both leaders had the 60 guests at the celebrity-studded,
black-tie event in stitches.
   Thatcher made a jocular reference to the Bushes' purported
difficulties with a famous guest at their family compound in Maine.
   Mrs. Thatcher recalled that it was from Downing Street that
orders went out to burn the White House in 1814.
   ``Well, houses do need a bit of renovation from time to time,''
she said. ``But don't worry, we've decided to spare Kennebunkport
the same treatment, ever since we heard that you had to rebuild it
anyway for your recent distinguished visitors.''
   Mrs. Thatcher was referring to reports, denied by the White
House, that when French President Francois Mitterrand of France
recently stayed at the Bush family home in Kennebunkport, Maine, he
demanded a bigger bed and a lower toilet.
   Bush paid a warm tribute to another guest, former Prime Minister
Sir Alec Douglas-Home, whom he met in New York in 1972 when ``I was
the new boy on the block ... just out of Congress, representing our
country at the United Nations.''
   Home, then foreign minister, was at U.N. headquarters on
important business, while the Bushes were wondering how to while
away a Sunday afternoon in New York.
   ``I said to (Barbara), `I wonder what Sir Alec Douglas-Home is
doing this morning?' She said, `Don't you dare!' And I said `No,
I'm going to call him up.'
   ``And darn if he didn't say `Yes, I'd love to go out to
Greenwich and see the birds'' at the National Audubon Society Bird
Sanctuary in Connecticut.
   ``That marvelous gesture on his part _ of accepting the
hospitality of a lowly ambassador, and certainly a new one in
foreign affairs _ we've never forgotten it. And I don't know
whether his wife has forgotten my boosting her across the fence
into the bird sanctuary,'' the president added.
   Mrs. Bush made quite a splash in London.
   Thatcher called her ``a marvelous first lady'' and boasted that
her husband Denis had ``made a fantastic hit with Barbara.
Absolutely terrific, terrific!''
   Mrs. Bush made quite a hit with photographers earlier in the day
when Denis Thatcher greeted her by kissing her hand.
   As the media clamored for more, Mrs. Bush plucked Denis
Thatcher's hand and kissed it.
   At the dinner, the president eyed his wife and the prime
minister's husband and admonished, ``We don't want another
front-page picture.''
   ``Indeed, once a day is enough,'' agreed Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``I won't kiss your hand again,'' Barbara assured Denis.
   The president, an avid sportsman, was clearly pleased with his
host's choice of guests. He swung an imaginary club when golf's
Masters champion, Nick Faldo, came through the receiving line.
   And when Thatcher asked, ``Do you know Virginia Wade?'' he
replied, ``I feel as if I do as a tennis fan.''
   Later, Bush thanked Thatcher for having ``adequately
accommodated my insatiable quest for being the name dropper of the
year by the distinguished guests here.'' Other famous Britons on
the guest list included composer Andrew Lloyd Webber of ``Cats''
fame and comedian John Cleese, star of ``A Fish Called Wanda.''

<HEAD>Terminally Ill, Duarte Lives for Presidential Succession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exhausted by cancer, calamity
and revolution, President Jose Napoleon Duarte has completed what
may be his greatest victory _ peacefully turning his government
over to an elected successor.
   He yielded power Thursday to Alfredo Cristiani, the new
president who represents Duarte's nemesis on the right wing.
   Duarte's closest political adviser, commenting on condition his
name not be used, said that with the president's ebbing strength,
Duarte is given to reflecting on his crusade for democracy in El
Salvador.
   ``He feels ambivalent, because he began by taking power away
from the oligarchy and now it may seem he's handing it back,'' the
adviser told The Associated Press.
   ``He is aware of the irony in the fact that handing power to the
most disagreeable political opposition will consolidate the
democratic process he has dedicated his life to building.''
   The adviser, an old friend and fellow founder of the Christian
Democratic Party, sees Duarte almost daily.
   He described how Duarte has had to lie in an oxygen tent, wasted
by dehydrating vomiting and diarrhea. Like the ulcers in Duarte's
mouth, they are brought on by chemotherapy.
   The 63-year-old engineer-turned-politician is likely to be
remembered as crucial to a gradual and difficult replacement of an
authoritarian, semifeudal system of government with an incipient
democracy.
   But he approached the end of his term and his life burdened by
failures and compromises that will weigh heavily as history
deliberates its verdict.
   Duarte has terminal liver cancer. Since it was diagnosed in June
1988, he has made periodic trips to Walter Reed Army Medical Center
in Washington for treatment, which leaves him bedridden.
   His doctor, Jose Luis Saca, told the AP the latest round of
chemotherapy was particularly devastating. Duarte is given little
to no chance of reaching his 64th birthday, in November.
   Duarte considers himself to a great degree personally
responsible for conditions permitting the unprecedented succession,
and sees it as a crowning achievement.
   But he also considers Cristiani's Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena, an authoritarian, antidemocratic party inclined
to erode gains in human rights and civil liberties.
   ``One must acknowledge President Duarte's democratic vocation,''
said Cristiani in an interview with foreign correspondents before
taking office. ``He has, with his aptitudes and positions, promoted
democracy. But I wouldn't go so far as to call him the father of
Salvadoran democracy.''
   A summation of Duarte's five-year term includes notable
expansion of freedom of expression, drastic reduction in
politically motivated murders, labor union pluralism and three
nationwide elections judged free and fair by international
observers.
   But his two main objectives _ ending civil war and reviving a
moribund economy _ remained as far from fulfillment as when he took
office.
   Marxist-led guerrillas have been waging a revolution against the
U.S.-backed government for nine years. Despite more than $3.5
billion in economic and military aid from Washington, the rebels
continue to dominate territory in the north and east.
   Though the 7,000 insurgents are outnumbered eight-to-one by
security forces, they have demonstrated the capacity to attack
major garrisons and keep the army on the defensive in much of the
Massachusetts-sized country.
   The economy is a shambles. El Salvador would be virtually
bankrupt without international help. Production of the major export
crops _ coffee, sugar and cotton _ has declined sharply along with
private investment and the standard of living.
   Health care, potable water and primary education are little more
than dreams for most of the rural population. Corruption and
nepotism within Duarte's administration are widespread.
   The judiciary is all but completely ineffective. Though death
squad activity has declined, politically motivated assassins
continue to murder with impunity.
   Duarte, aware of the gravity of his disease, offered in last
year's state-of-the-republic address a balance sheet on his
presidency.
   ``The will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day
more stormy and more dangerous because of cross-currents. The
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims,'' he
said.
   A high-ranking U.S. diplomat, who has been in El Salvador for
most of Duarte's term, remarked, ``He didn't work miracles, so he
has taken a lot of knocks, some fair and some not. He was not a
great administrator. He merged the party and the government and
surrounded himself with some unscrupulous people. But he must be
credited with instituting the democratic system itself. His great
legacy is this transition. The rest pales by comparison.''
   Ignacio Ellacuria, a Roman Catholic priest who is rector of the
prestigious Central American University, said Duarte ``never
realized what little real power he had. He's not a false man, but
he is a man who is self-deceived. His hands were completely tied by
the United States and the armed forces.
   ``Obviously, he has governed amid much danger and difficulty.
The FMLN was against him, private enterprise was against him, the
media were against him, Arena was against him. So he had to take
refuge in the armed forces and the United States,'' said Ellacuria.
   The FMLN are the Spanish initials for the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front.
   Ellacuria harshly criticized Duarte for presiding over a junta
in 1981-82, the years of most ferocious repression during which
death squads and the military were blamed for abducting and
murdering up to 700 suspected leftists each month.
   ``Duarte accepted thousands of murders with the facile argument
that, if he were not there (on the junta), there would be more.
That is a measure of this man's ambition for power.''

   A 7-year-old boy mutilated in a sexual
attack is acting as if nothing is wrong after his release from the
hospital: he wants to return to school and get a new Nintendo game,
his mother says.
   People shocked by the attack have donated about $200,000 to help
the boy resume a normal life.
   ``It's a miracle,'' Helen Harlow, the child's mother, said
Wednesday after he was released from Mary Bridge's Hospital.
   ``The fact that he's healing so rapidly and that his spirits are
so high and that the trauma doesn't seem to have made any kind of
mental block is something else,'' she said in an interview with
KING-TV in Seattle.
   He was raped and choked May 20 by a man who lured him into the
woods while the boy was riding his bike. The child's penis was cut
off in the attack.
   Earl Kenneth Shriner, who authorities said has a history of
violence against young people, has been charged in the assault.
   Ms. Harlow said her son, who has a different last name, is eager
to resume a normal life and wants to go back to school.
   ``He's not looking at this as a problem. He's just looking at it
as how it is and now let's get on with life. `Where's the next
Nintendo game? I needed Zelda One, not Zelda Two.'''
   Ms. Harlow added that she wants to do what she can ``to make
sure this kind of thing never happens again and to thank everybody
that's been so wonderful.''
   Officials said Wednesday that people have donated $200,000 to a
trust fund and the hospital waived $12,000 in bills. In addition,
the state Crime Victim Compensation fund most likely will pay up to
$150,000 for his remaining medical and counseling bills.
   The state pays up to that amount for anyone who is an innocent
victim of a felony or gross misdemeanor, said Mark McDermott, who
administers the program.
   The boy's mother has said neither she nor his father have
medical insurance to cover the child.
   Police Detective Stan Mowre, who led the fund-raising effort,
said details of how the ``Community Cares Trust Fund'' will be
administered are being worked out. But he said, ``All moneys will
go for expenditure of the boy for education and medical bills.''
   Just how much the boy's medical and counseling care will cost
over his lifetime remains a big question. Doctors say the boy will
need reconstructive surgery to rebuild his penis, and he already
has begun seeing a mental health counselor.
   Throughout the state, people have dug into their pockets at Elks
meetings, grocery stores and taverns to help. Mail stuffed with
letters, checks and cash has arrived by the bucket at Pacific First
Federal Savings Bank's James Center branch, said manager Jim
Bichsel.
   The mail run peaked Tuesday when the bank received 1,500 checks
and letters, said Debbie Anderson, personal banking representative.
There also have been two offers of computers and a trip to
Disneyland.
   ``It's kind of fun,'' Bichsel said. ``There's a sense of unity
among the staff to get it done for him. It's part of their
contribution.''

   Both sides in the abortion battle are squaring
off over a ``morning after'' abortion pill that is available in
France but not in the United States.
   Officials of national Right to Life said they are prepared to
encourage a boycott of products distributed by an American
affiliate of the French manufacturer of the pill if there is an
attempt to license the drug in the United States.
   And on the other side, leaders of the National Organization for
Women and the Fund for the Feminist Majority call such tactics
``medical McCarthyism'' and are preparing to lobby federal health
officials and commercial drug companies to start American testing
of the abortion pill.
   The drug, called RU486, is now being used for about 15 percent
of the elective abortions in France and is being studied for the
treatment of certain diseases. RU486 has not been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration for distribution in the United States.
   NOW President Molly Yard charged at a Thursday news conference
that the Right to Life organization is intimidating American
pharmaceutical firms from attempting to license or test the drug in
this country.
   ``It is a total insensitivity on the part of Right to Life to be
working to keep this drug out (of the United States),'' said Ms.
Yard. ``We intend to organize people to see to it that we get RU486
into this country.''
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,
said that a campaign against RU486 by the Right to Life
organization has ``put a chill on research'' and caused American
drug companies to avoid investing in the abortion pill.
   ``We intend to visit the pharmaceutical industry leaders and ask
them to rise above this medical McCarthyism,'' said Ms. Smeal. ``We
believe it is their moral and scientific responsibility.''
   ``McCarthyism'' is a term that refers to the use of unfounded
accusation to intimidate and threaten. It originates from
anti-Communism hearings conducted by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis.,
in the 1950s.
   Richard Glasow, a spokesman for the national Right to Life,
acknowledged that his organization discussed a boycott with
officials of Hoechst-Rouselle, the American affiliate of
Roussel-Uclaf, the French company that makes RU486.
   ``We asked them to not bring the abortion pill to the U.S.,''
said Glasow. ``We pointed out to them that we have encouraged
members to boycott'' another company that makes drugs used in
clinical abortions.
   He said Hoechst-Rouselle officials said they had no plans to
market RU486 in the United States.
   Glasow added: ``We didn't threaten Hoeschst-Rouselle with a
boycott. We just said that was a possibility.''
   He said an international anti-abortion group to which the
American organization belongs has instituted a boycott in Europe
against products made by affiliates of Rossel-Uclaf.
   Olivia Gans, also an official with Right to Life, said her
organization is opposed to RU486 because ``we have concerns about
its safety to women in addition to the fact that it destroys the
baby.''
   Ms. Yard said that RU486, in addition to use for abortions, has
``shown promise'' in the treatment of a variety of diseases,
including breast cancer; glaucoma, a disease that can cause
blindness; endometriosis, a pelvic disease that can cause
infertility in women, and Cushing's Sydrome, a disease of hormone
imbalance.
   Though RU486 has been referred to as a ``morning after''
abortion pill, Ms. Smeal said the drug is used in France only under
medical supervision.
   In a typical case, she said, a woman seeking an abortion is
examined at a clinic to confirm her pregnancy and then takes three
200 milligram pills of RU486. Two days later she returns to the
clinic for an injection of prostaglandin, a hormone. Sometime after
the shot, the fetus is expelled. The patient returns to the clinic
two weeks later for a follow-up examination.
   Use of RU486 is limited to the first seven weeks of pregnancy.
   Ms. Smeal said that the only side effect to RU486 is bleeding in
less than 1 percent of the patients who have taken the drug.

<HEAD>Administration Fights to Preserve Surtax on Elderly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is urging Congress to
think twice before cutting taxes that finance a catastrophic
illness insurance program for millions of older Americans.
   Until government can get a better estimate of how much the
surtax will bring in and how much catastrophic coverage will cost,
``Treasury would not consider it prudent to alter the premium,''
assistant treasury secretary John G. Wilkins told the Senate
Finance Committee on Thursday.
   The panel and the House Ways and Means Committee are considering
several bills to repeal or delay the surtax, which was enacted less
than a year ago. The new law is under heavy fire from many older
Americans.
   Many say they do not need the coverage because they have private
insurance. Others complain they cannot afford the surtax, which
this year is 15 percent of a Medicare beneficiary's federal income
tax of $150 or more. About 40 percent of older people pay the
surtax; the maximum tax is $800 per beneficiary.
   Unless Congress makes some changes, cautioned Rep. Harris
Fawell, R-Ill., ``there is going to be a popular revolt the likes
of which haven't been seen since'' a massive mail campaign led to
repeal of withholding of taxes from interest and dividends in 1983.
   Efforts to change the catastrophic law gained momentum recently
when Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance
Committee, disclosed government forecasts that the new tax will
bring in more than had been estimated just a year ago. He raised
the possibility of cutting the tax.
   During the five years ending in 1993, the Congressional Budget
Office now estimates, the surtax is likely to bring in about $10
billion more than is expected to be spent for catastrophic benefits.
   However, administration officials cautioned that the surplus may
never exist, because the new program of catastrophic drug benefits
starting in 1991 could cost far more than previously estimated.
   ``We cannot recommend a reduction in premium (surtax) revenue at
this time, knowing that the drug benefit faces financial difficulty
in the near future,'' said Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health
and human services.
   The committee got lots of advice to the contrary from members of
Congress and from organizations representing older Americans.
   ``The seniors of America are angry, are growing more angry
daily, and their numbers are growing as new questions about this
act materialize,'' said Daniel L. Hawley of Las Vegas, president of
Seniors Coalition Against Catastrophic Act. ``If this act is not
repealed, beginning in 1990 there will be the largest turnover in
Congress in its history.''
   Lovola Burgess of Albuquerque, vice president of the American
Association of Retired Persons, said that organization _ the
largest representing seniors _ would prefer another financing
method but believes the benefits are important enough to justify a
less-than-perfect tax.
   But if Congress changes the tax, she said, it should do so by
reducing the surtax rate below its 15 percent level. Using
Congressional Budget Office estimates of the projected surplus, she
said the rate could be cut to 10.5 percent this year; the 28
percent level scheduled for 1993 could be cut to 19.6 percent.
   ``This option affects the largest number of beneficiaries...
from those paying the least, to those paying the most,'' Ms.
Burgess said. Although it would not reduce the number of people
paying the surtax, it would cut the number paying the maximum
amount.
   ``Over 20,000 Arizonans have contacted me since passage of the
final act,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told the committee. ``Not
more than 10 have indicated their support.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., sponsor of a bill to require
upper-income Americans of all ages to pay for the program, said the
the elderly are unwilling to pay the surtax.
   ``They don't understand ... why they are the only group in our
society which is being asked to subsidize another part of their
group,'' Levin said.

   House Republicans who oppose President Bush's
effort to make savings and loan banks put more of their own money
at risk will have another chance to fight that provision of the $50
billion industry bailout bill.
   As Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., moved Thursday to
speed the bill to the House floor for action next week, lobbyists
said three House Republicans were planning to fight its capital
requirements.
   The bill would make some 500 cash-poor savings and loan banks
come up with $13 billion in new capital by 1995.
   Foley told Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., acting chairman of the
House Rules Committee, that he wants the panel to act on the
legislation next Tuesday so that the full House can begin
considering it next Wednesday.
   But lobbyists said Rep. Jimmy Quillen of Tennessee, ranking
Republican on the Rules Committee, was working with Reps. Thomas
Ridge, R-Pa., and Henry Hyde, R-Ill., on spearheading a movement to
thwart Bush's plan for making S&amp;L owners put up more of their own
money.
   Ridge tried unsuccessfully to defeat the new capital
requirements in the House Banking Committee. And Hyde last week
failed on a 17-17 tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee to
delay the new capital requirements for 18 months.
   As approved by the banking committee, the bill would make
cash-poor S&amp;Ls either raise new capital to act as a buffer between
future loan losses and federal deposit insurance funds, or require
the institutions to shrink in size.
   Under current regulations, S&amp;Ls can operate without their owners
having any of their own money at risk. Bush and others have blamed
that lax standard for the magnitude of the current crisis, which
has created an estimated $35 billion to $55 billion hole in the
government's deposit insurance fund.
   The House bill would require S&amp;L owners to put at least $1.50 of
their own money at risk by June 1990 for each $100 of federally
insured deposits they loan out. By 1995, that capital requirement
would climb to $3 for every $100 in loans.
   Meanwhile, another House committee on Thursday rejected as
``voodoo accounting'' Bush's plan to prevent the $50 billion that
the government will borrow for the bailout from swelling the
federal deficit.
   On a 22-15 party-line vote with only one Democrat supporting
Bush's plan, the House Government Operations Committee approved
including the immediate $50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout
as part of the federal budgets for this year and fiscal 1990 and
1991.
   The House Ways and Means Committee took a similar posture
earlier as the S&amp;L measure wound its way through several House
committees with shared jurisdiction over parts of the complicated
legislation.
   The Senate has already passed its version, with Democrats
falling 12 votes short of defeating Bush's financing mechanism,
which would raise the deficit by only $4.5 billion over the three
years but cost taxpayers a like amount in higher interest charges.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the Government 0perations
Committee's chairman, said Bush's approach creates ``a windfall for
Wall Street in which wealthy purchasers of the bonds benefit at the
expense of taxpayers.''
   Borrowing from the term ``voodoo economics'' Bush once used to
describe President Reagan's theory that lower taxes would reduce
the deficit, Conyers called the administration's S&amp;L plan ``voodoo
accounting designed only to hide the true costs of the bailout from
the American people.''
   The only Democrat on the committee to vote in favor of Bush's
financing plan was Rep. Doug Barnard of Georgia, a former banker.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins accused Democrats of
using the S&amp;L crisis ``in a back-door way'' to fight the
no-new-taxes agreement between Bush and Congress to reduce the 1990
fiscal budget deficit to $100 billion.
   ``This has nothing to do with S&amp;Ls,'' he said. ``The questions
is whether we maintain in a new administration the budgeting
discipline of Gramm-Rudman. The real issue is creating a waiver
process for new spending.''
   Including interest costs on the borrowing, the bailout will cost
an estimated $285 billion to $330 billion over the next 30 years,
making it the largest in the nation's history.
   The General Accounting Office estimates that at least 70 percent
of that money _ or approximately $1,000 for every man, woman and
child in the country _ will come from taxpayers.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, still denying the
ethics charges against him, is painting himself as a victim of
political retribution and of a desire to accomplish too much, too
fast in Congress.
   In a 1{-hour luncheon with reporters and in a series of
television interviews on Thursday, an unrepentant Wright said he
decided last weekend to resign from Congress because he expected
the ethics committee to recommend he be reprimanded, a move which
likely would have cost him his speakership.
   To fight that recommendation would have been too politically
costly and tied the House in knots for a long time to come, he
said. ``So I decided that is one of those things that I can't
change.''
   Wright said he believed Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.,
the man who will succeed him, is better suited to heal the wounds
caused by the ethics fight.
   ``He does have a temperamental advantage in the sense of being
more cautious, reasoned, less hurried,'' Wright said. ``I was
probably obsessed with the notion that I had a limited period of
time in which to make my mark on the future. That was one of my
attitudes, perhaps a failing.''
   In the interview, Wright was by turns jovial and emotional,
offering an unusual self-analysis and portraying himself as seeking
to restore peace to the chamber he had plunged into turmoil during
his stormy 2{-year tenure.
   He reached back to memories of his adolescence in Dallas, when a
football coach persuaded him to join the school debate team and he
became interested in Woodrow Wilson's ideas for the League of
Nations.
   ``From that time, I didn't want to do anything except to come to
Congress and to use whatever influence I could to help create the
basis for a more peaceful world,'' Wright said, his voice breaking.
He paused a moment to regain his composure, and added:
   ``You get so self-righteous about these things, I guess, you
think your way is right. So you get very determined and you try to
make things happen in a way that you believe, in your finite
judgment, is best. And maybe you are not the possessor of infinite
wisdom. Maybe the other guys have got good ideas, too.''
   Wright dated his misfortunes from Nov. 13, 1987, when he
attended a meeting between Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and
Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo in Washington, during
which the cardinal agreed to carry a peace proposal to the Reagan
administration-backed Contra rebels.
   ``From that moment there was nothing but hostility from the
administration,'' Wright said. ``There was a determination on the
part of certain people in the other party to see to it that I was
removed.''
   Wright came in for criticism that he was trying to usurp the
foreign policy-making prerogatives of the executive branch, but won
praise from Democratic liberals who opposed the Contra policy.
   The Texas Democrat did not allude to his ethics problems during
the interview, preferring to dwell on what he saw as the highlights
of his 34-year House career. He sat in his private dining room
decorated with the U.S. and Texas flags and a set of longhorns over
the door.
   Wright announced his resignation in a House speech Wednesday
after a yearlong investigation that led to charges that he
improperly accepted gifts and sought to evade House outside income
limits.
   He said he hoped his tenure as speaker would be remembered ``as
a time when we began to turn from our preoccupation with military
might to a recognition of the long-deferred agenda of building and
rebuilding America.''
   And he added: ``If I've made any contribution to peace in the
world, then that's the thing of which I'd be proudest.''
   He said he made up his mind to resign during a weekend getaway
with his wife, Betty, at a friend's lodge in the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia. But he said he had decided early this year
that he would not seek another term in Congress, and had told the
majority leader, Foley, to ``get ready to be speaker.''
   He said he had received calls from his home district of Fort
Worth urging him to stay and fight the charges. ``They didn't
understand the climate in Washington. They didn't realize the
deadly destruction this entire episode had wrought ... the wicked
forces it had set in motion between Democrats and Republicans in
the House.''

<HEAD>Former President of Dallas S&amp;L Charged In Fraud Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of a savings and loan and several of
the company's senior officers were charged Thursday with
misapplying funds to make campaign contributions to members of
Congress.
   A federal grand jury here returned a 33-count indictment
charging Patrick G. King, former president of Vernon Savings and
Loan Association, with conspiring with other senior Vernon officers
to commit fraud.
   The scheme allegedly involved reimbursing Vernon officers
approximately $55,000 for political campaign contributions to
candidates for state and federal office, said FBI special agent
Woody Specht.
   The indictment charges that the scheme involved contributions in
1986 to Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Loeffler and
the 1986 Texas Tribute, an organization that donated money to
several politicians, including House Speaker Jim Wright of Fort
Worth, U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp,
R-New York.
   But the indictment emphasized that there were no allegations
whatsoever that any of the candidates or campaign organizations
knew that the contributions were coming from Vernon or were
otherwise illegal.
   Wright, under fire for alleged ethics violations, announced his
resignation as speaker Wednesday.
   Cranston was serving on the banking committee at the time of the
donations, the indictment said.
   The indictment, which charges King with conspiring with other
senior officers to defraud the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and to
misapply Vernon funds and enter false statements in its books and
records, was announced by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.
   The task force is a multi-agency group which brought the charges
as part of the U.S. Justice Department's ongoing investigation of
suspected fraud in the Texas banking and savings industry.
   ``In effect, the indictment charges that officials contributed
to campaigns but were then reimbursed through various methods like
through payroll accounts, expense accounts,'' Specht said. ``They
were getting the money back.
   ``The indictment shows that bank officials made contributions
and then false entries were made, et cetera, to conceal the fact
that funds were really paid for political contributions,'' he said.
   Vernon, which had offices in Vernon, Texas, and Dallas, was
closed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, on
Nov. 19, 1987.

<HEAD>Scientists Announce Way of Transplanting Genes Through Sperm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sperm cells can be used to introduce
foreign genes into animals, a discovery that could make it much
easier to produce genetically engineered animals, according to a
study published today.
   A team led by Dr. C. Spadafora at the Institute of Biomedical
Technology in Rome reported that mouse sperm cells incubated in a
solution with segments of foreign DNA could capture the DNA
molecules.
   In the experiment, these spermatozoa then were used to fertilize
mouse eggs in vitro. Many of the newly born mice incorporated the
foreign DNA into their genetic material, the doctors wrote in the
June issue of journal Cell.
   Of 250 mice, 30 percent showed evidence of the foreign DNA.
   DNA, an essential component of all living matter, contains the
body's genetic code and transmits its hereditary pattern.
   The scientists also did comparable experiments with frogs and
sea urchins, indicating that the ability of sperm to capture
foreign DNA is widespread among species.
   The production of transgenic animals, or those carrying a
foreign gene, had previously been accomplished only by injecting
DNA into single-celled embryos.
   The researchers said the results suggest broad applications for
the use of sperm in producing many types of genetically engineered
animals. The findings also imply that sperm could be a natural
point of entry for foreign DNA, which has possible implications for
evolution and the transmission for disease, the journal said.
   ``If confirmed by others, this publication will be a cornerstone
in biology,'' Max Birnstiel of the Research Institute of Molecular
Pathology in Vienna wrote in an accompanying editorial.
   Birnstiel said the research is important ``not only because the
technique promises to do away with the laborious and technically
demanding needle work for producing transgenic animals, but also
because of its potential usefulness for introducing commercially
important features into such animal species that have so far proved
difficult to deal with or refractory to present day technology.''
   Until now, gene transplantation in animals has been used mainly
to create special breeds for research into diseases such as cancer
and AIDS.

   Restoring public confidence in Japan's government
would be a formidible task for anyone in the wake of the Recruit
Co. scandal that toppled Prime Minister Noboro Takeshita.
   For Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno, it could be an impossible one.
   In giving its blessing today for Uno to succeed Takeshita, the
governing Liberal Democrats have picked an experienced politician
who was the party's second choice.
   Party leaders first tried to persuade Masayoshi Ito, 75, to take
the job but Ito refused, citing poor health at age 66 and
dissatisfaction with the party's handling of reforms.
   Few leaders within the scandal-ridden party sang the praises of
Uno. Indeed, many put forward last-minute alternatives to his
nomination.
   Many fear he cannot win public confidence in the government,
shaken by the influence-peddling Recruit scandal that forced
Takeshita to step down and led to charges against 17 politicians,
bureaucrats and businessmen.
   Analysts have speculated that party bosses, who are too tainted
by the financial scandal to take the post now, settled on Uno as an
interim leader who will allow them to exert influence and not
derail their future aspirations.
   Even the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest
newspaper, described Uno, who has been foreign minister since 1987,
only as ``a reasonable choice.''
   ``Some party leaders would have preferred that the successor to
Prime Minister Takeshita come from the junior ranks in order to
revitalize the party. But Uno was chosen to maintain party
harmony,'' Yomiuri said in an editorial.
   Former prime ministers Zenko Suzuki and Takeo Fukuda suggested
group leadership and expressed fears Uno may be too weak to steer
the conservative party to victory in parliamentary elections this
summer.
   Support for the Liberal Democrats has fallen to the lowest
levels ever, largely because of the scandal.
   The Recruit Co., a publishing and information services
conglomerate, is accused of winning government favors by handing
out millions of dollars in political donations and underpriced
stock.
   Though Uno himself is untainted by the scandal, he is closely
allied with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. The scandal
developed during his 1982-87 tenure.
   Uno said today that he would quit Nakasone's political faction.
   However, their previous close ties damaged Uno's reputation, and
they almost cost him the party nomination, analysts say.
   But supporters say Uno's high-ranking Cabinet posts in a country
striving for a stronger international role have made him a familiar
figure to the Japanese public.
   Uno has headed the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
the Defense Agency, and the Science and Technology Agency. He is a
10-term member of the lower house of Parliament from Shiga
prefecture in western Japan.
   Born Aug. 27, 1922, into a wealthy family in Shiga, Uno fought
in World War II and served on the Asian mainland before being taken
prisoner by Soviet troops in northern Korea. He and his wife,
Chiyo, have two children, a son and daughter.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Praise Crackdown On Loan Defaults</HEAD>

   An Education Department crackdown on schools
with soaring loan default rates is drawing praise from lawmakers
and passing marks even from the trade schools that will be most
affected by the more stringent policies.
   Schools turning out extremely high percentages of delinquent
borrowers will face an escalating series of corrective and punitive
actions under new regulations announced Thursday by Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   Cavazos also said his department will take administrative steps
and submit a package of legislative proposals to Congress as part
of a strategy to ease the default problem, which is expected to
cost taxpayers $1.8 billion this fiscal year.
   ``There are some unscrupulous and uncaring institutions out
there who are taking advantage of a program designed to help our
students, not financially shackle them,'' Cavazos said. He said
such schools ``promise to educate but deliver only a debt.''
   The prime targets of the crackdown are for-profit vocational
schools which have an average default rate of 40 percent, compared
to 20 percent for community colleges and about 10 percent for other
types of institutions. The top 10 schools on a list released by the
department were all trade schools with default rates topping 80
percent.
   Officers of two major proprietary school associations called the
Cavazos approach definitely preferable to the plan advanced a year
ago by his predecessor, William Bennett.
   Bennett's plan called for punitive proceedings against all
schools with default rates above 20 percent. Cavazos said that
would have affected 2,500 schools and been impossible for the
department to administer.
   Under his approach, schools must have default rates over 60
percent to trigger proceedings to limit, suspend or terminate their
participation in the huge student loan program. Those at 40 to 60
percent will have to reduce their rate by 5 percent a year to avoid
triggering the proceedings. The system takes effect Jan. 1, 1991.
   Less Draconian steps such as default management plans, delayed
loan disbursements and pro-rata refunds will be required at lower
levels.
   Stephen Blair, president of the 1,250-member National
Association of Trade and Technical Schools, called the Cavazos
regulations ``thoughtful and reasonable. They tailor remedies to
the situation. We're confident they will make a difference. They
will substantially reduce the defaults.''
   Jim Phillips, executive vice president of the Association of
Independent Colleges and Schools, a group of business schools
operating at 1,100 locations, said a positive feature of the new
regulations is their delayed implementation.
   ``Secretary Cavazos at least ... is giving the institutions
enough time to first of all be forewarned about what's coming and
second of all to do something about it if they can,'' he said.
   ``My concern is the latter _ whether there is anything else
these institutions can do to solve what is still more of a social
problem than an education problem,'' Phillips added, referring to
the high proportion of low-income, inner-city, academically risky
students served by proprietary schools.
   At his news conference, Cavazos said that type of problem would
be considered ``on a case-by-case basis ... There is not an
absolute cutoff. We are going to work with these schools.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, called the Cavazos package ``a more
constructive approach'' than the one taken by Bennett and said he
would work with the department.
   But Hawkins said he would look very carefully at the
department's legislative proposals in order to make sure ``our
efforts to deal with the student loan default problem (do) not
excessively punish privately owned schools and other institutions
of higher education with a high percentage of poor and minority
students.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Education
subcommittee and sponsor of a default reduction bill that passed
the Senate in March, said Cavazos had taken ``a solid step
forward'' with his package.
   Cavazos is asking Congress to enact a number of reforms. His
legislative proposals would require lenders to offer student
borrowers graduated repayment schedules and bar schools from using
commissioned recruiters. It also would require pro-rata refunds at
high-default schools for student grants as well as loans and
authorize guarantee agencies to withhold defaulters' wages, up to
10 percent of disposable pay.
   In addition, the department wants lawmakers to require those
without a high school diploma or its equivalent to pass an
independently developed and administered ``ability-to-benefit''
test before enrolling in a course of study. Currently the schools
write and administer the test themselves, often after a student is
enrolled.
   Administrative steps are to include more frequent program
reviews, audits and investigations by Education Department staff
and expanded fraud detection through a toll-free hotline.
   Some 4.6 million students are expected to borrow money under the
student loan program in fiscal 1989. The program is projected to
cost $5 billion this year, with 37 percent of the money going to
cover defaulted loans.
   According to the Education Department, the 10 schools with the
nation's worst default problems, based on rates for students who
were required to start paying back loans in 1986, are:
   _The Sawyer School of Business, Center Line, Mich., 93.8 percent.
   _Kalamazoo Beauty Academy, Kalamazoo, Mich., 89.5 percent.
   _Cambridge Business College, Detroit, 86 percent.
   _Payne-Pulliam School of Trade, Detroit, 85.5 percent.
   _Chicago School of Automatic Transmission, 84.7 percent.
   _Odessa's College of Beauty, Gary, Ind., 83.8 percent.
   _Maryland Institute of Technology, Baltimore, 83.3 percent.
   _Midsouth School of Beauty, Memphis, Tenn., 82.9 percent.
   _Jerome's School of Beauty Culture, New Orleans, 82.2 percent.
   _Americo Technical Careers, New Orleans, 81.8 percent.
   The department developed its list from statistics gathered from
guarantee agencies for loans in each state.
   George Lamb, supervisor of the student loan program in Michigan,
disputed the 93.8 percent default rate attributed to the Sawyer
school and said his agency may have transposed some data. In
November 1987, when the department issued its first default list,
Sawyer had a 70.88 percent default rate among students required to
start repayments in 1985, according to Education Department
spokesman Tom Lyon.

<HEAD>NRC Says Troubled Florida Nuke Plant Might Face Shutdown</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, citing a
long lag in promised improvements at a Florida nuclear plant, said
it might consider closing the twin-reactor station later this year.
   The commission raised the possibility of such an extraordinary
step after announcing Thursday that the No. 3 and 4 units at the
Turkey Point nuclear station, near Florida City, Fla., would be
kept on its ``watch list'' of troubled plants.
   As a result of its regular six-month review of all 110 licensed
U.S. nuclear power plants, the commission took four reactors off
the watch list, added two others and expressed deep concern that
Turkey Point has been on the list for three years.
   Turkey Point is the only plant in the nation to appear on the
NRC's ``Category 2'' watch list each time since the list was
started in 1986. Plants in this category are allowed to continue
running, but only with increased NRC supervision.
   The commission said Thursday it was adding a third resident
inspector at Turkey Point to beef up oversight.
   Regulators also said they were keeping the Tennessee Valley
Authority's Browns Ferry 1, 2 and 3 reactors on their ``Category
3'' watch list, which is reserved for plants that are shut down and
cannot restart without special NRC approval.
   The Pilgrim plant, near Plymouth, Mass., and the Peach Bottom
units 2 and 3, near Lancaster, Pa., were moved up to Category 2 to
reflect the fact that they have been allowed to restart. Both will
continue to receive special NRC monitoring until they demonstrate a
sustained improvement in operations, the commission said.
   The regulators also announced that two nuclear reactors owned by
Virginia Power Co. had been added to the watch list, in part
because of increased violations of NRC rules. Just last month the
utility was fined $500,000 _ the sixth largest fine since the
commission was created in 1975 _ for violating safety regulations.
The Surry No. 1 and 2 reactors are situated near Newport News, Va.
   The watch list includes four other operating reactors: Calvert
Cliffs No. 1 and 2, of Annapolis, Md., and Nine Mile Point No. 1
and 2, of Oswego, N.Y.
   Victor Stello, the commission's chief of operations, told a
commission meeting, ``We're very disappointed'' that the Turkey
Point reactors has remained on the problem list for three years
without showing a clear improvement trend.
   Stello said, without explicitly suggesting that Turkey Point be
forced to close, that more drastic NRC action might be required
unless the plant's owner, Florida Power &amp; Light Co., made faster
progress in solving the problems.
   Three of the five commissioners made similar remarks.
   ``I don't know how long the commission can continue to monitor
Turkey Point with increased resources,'' said Lando W. Zech Jr.,
the commission chairman.
   ``I think the Florida Power &amp; Light organization should
recognize that the commission's patience is wearing very thin,'' he
said, adding, ``Turkey Point has not shown us much.''
   Kenneth Carr, a commission member, said in a tone of incredulity
that he found it ``interesting'' that while Turkey Point had failed
to ``get well'' after three years of intensified NRC monitoring,
most nuclear plants that had been forced to shut down because of
operating problems had managed to recover in two years.
   ``We might have done them a favor'' by forcing Turkey Point to
close, he added.
   Spokesmen at Florida Power &amp; Light did not return a reporter's
telephone call.
   Earlier this week the company said it had achieved ``vast
improvements'' at Turkey Point over the past year. It was
responding to a report by an anti-nuclear group, Public Citizen,
that ranked Turkey Point No. 3 as the worst-run nuclear plant in
the country. It rated the Turkey Point No. 4 unit as 10th worst.
   The four reactors that were removed from the NRC watch list
Thursday are Sequoyah No. 1 and 2, of Chattanooga, Tenn.; Fermi-2
of Newport, Mich., and Fort Calhoun, of Omaha, Neb.

<HEAD>Leahy Says Congress Will Move Slowly on Drought Relief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress won't be rushing into drought relief
legislation this session the way it did last year, say the chairman
of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a Republican colleague.
   Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said
Thursday the drought that has devastated winter wheat in some key
states doesn't appear to be a problem yet to other crops.
   After a press conference on an unrelated topic, the senators
said the dry weather problems this year have not reached the
emergency proportions of 1988.
   ``We will take the appropriate steps, but not precipitously,''
said Leahy in reference to the dry spell that hit Kansas and nearby
states hard during early spring.
   ``I'm very concerned about winter wheat,'' he said, ``but I
don't want to move until we see about present crops.''
   Rains have been heavy in recent days in farm states, but they
didn't come soon enough to save most of the winter wheat crop which
the Agriculture Department this week called mostly fair to poor.
   In Kansas, the wheat looks poor to very poor, the department
said. Harvesting of the crop is under way in California, Georgia,
Oklahoma and Texas, while the wheat is still growing elsewhere.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and begins to sprout in
early spring, but shortage of spring rain, particularly in Kansas,
has devastated the crop.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., has introduced legislation that would
extend the 1988 drought relief law to this year's winter wheat
crop, but no further action has been taken on the bill.
   Leahy said he would ask Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to
brief members of the Agriculture Committee and other senators
interested in drought legislation soon.
   Yeutter, after touring Iowa drought areas earlier this week,
said, ``We have to be careful we don't overestimate the problems
and respond in a way that just isn't called for under the
circumstances.''
   The House Agriculture Committee last week passed drought
legislation that would extend the 1988 law to many crops besides
winter wheat. The bill has not been voted on by the full House.

   China is purchasing wheat at an unusually
rapid rate for the new marketing year, according to Agriculture
Department statistics.
   The department announced Thursday that exporters reported the
country had bought another 100,000 metric tons of soft red winter
wheat.
   That brings China's total for the marketing year beginning June
1 to 850,000 tons.
   The department said 300,000 tons was purchased in April under
the Export Enhancement Program, a U.S. government subsidy that
discounts commodities.
   But 550,000 tons purchased since May 25 have been a full market
value, estimated to be about $82.5 million.
   Last marketing year, China bought a total 8.3 million metric
tons for the full year.

   Advocates for the popular federal nutrition
program known as WIC say the government should spend $150 million
more on it next fiscal year for the poor people who should be
getting help but aren't.
   About 7.5 million women, infants and children are eligible, but
48 percent are not participating in the program, said Robert Fersh,
executive director of the Food Research and Action Center, who held
a press conference Thursday to announce the results of two studies
of the program.
   ``Our central finding is that young children, those between the
ages of one and five, are the least likely to receive the benefits
of WIC (Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and
Children),'' he said.
   ``In general, low-income children tend to be shorter and
lighter, and are more likely to suffer from impaired iron status
and anemia,'' he said. ``Poorer iron status is associated with
poorer performance on standardized tests.''
   He said the number of people who participate is dependent on the
amount of money Congress spends on the program.
   The federal budget resolution for fiscal 1990 passed by Congress
in a compromise with the White House calls for spending a total
$2.158 billion on WIC, including the $150 million Fersh wants in it.
   But the details of the budget are not worked out and the
Agriculture Department is facing a requested $1 billion in cuts and
the WIC program is part of agriculture.

   Republican strategists are urging GOP
lawmakers to make hay out of the ethics mess in the House of
Representatives by claiming it shows Democrats have held power
there for too many years.
   ``The Democrats in the House have grown arrogant with their
unchallenged power,'' says a memo circulated quietly among
Republican lawmakers this week by the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
   The committee produced the paper as a political script for
Republican congressmen in the ethics drama unfolding in the House.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, announced his resignation
Wednesday following a yearlong ethics probe. Less than a week
earlier, Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., resigned rather than
subject the Democrats and his family to an investigation of his
$100,000 junk bond purchase.
   The National Republican Congressional Committee raises funds,
produces briefing papers and videos, provides polling, research and
a wide array of other services aimed at helping GOP lawmakers
polish their political image. House Democrats and both parties in
the Senate maintain similar committees.
   In some respects, the briefing paper resembled dozens of others
turned out by the committee. In this case, however, it made
explicit a GOP strategy of exploiting the ethics mess for political
advantage.
   ``Power tends to corrupt, absolute power corrupts absolutely,''
it quoted the 19th Century historian Lord Acton. It cautioned
against falling in with what it described as a Democratic tendency
to blame the fall of Wright and Coelho on ``ethical McCarthyism''
and character assassination.
   ``This is absolutely false,'' it said. ``Jim Wright and Tony
Coelho's falls were character suicides.''
   It called the resignations of two of the top three Democrats in
the House ``the bitter fruit of 35 years of Democratic control of
that body,''
   ``Why did two prominent, intelligent members of the Democratic
leadership get into this bind?'' it asked at another point.
``Because there may have been a feeling of invulnerability. When
you can abuse the rights of the minority ... for as long as they
have, there could well be a feeling that you can do what you want,
ethics be damned.''
   Committee spokesman John Buckley said he was the author of the
document and that it was meant primarily for the eyes of Republican
congressmen. ``Obviously, it wasn't intended to be provided to a
reporter,'' he said.
   He said the GOP was ``fully prepared to take advantage of the
revelations about Democrats,'' but he denied there was any special
campaign-style effort to dig up new dirt.
   House Democratic leader Thomas Foley of Washington, who is
expected to become the next speaker of the House, called for
conciliation Thursday. But some of his followers were in a mood to
fight fire with fire politically.
   ``Democrats are trying to act with restraint,'' declared Rep.
Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y. ``But there comes a time when people are
going to push back, and push back awfully hard.''

   The House Republican leader is joining
Democrats in condemnation of leaks about a federal investigation of
Rep. William Gray, a Democrat running for majority whip.
   Rep. Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Thursday that news stories were
``apparently based on information from Justice Department
investigators and the office of the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia.''
   In a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Michel said he
was protesting ``possibly illegal leaking of information damaging
to a member of Congress.''
   ``It is just hard to imagine anything more irresponsible,''
Michel said. He said that if the Justice Department cannot complete
a successful investigation into the leaks, Thornburgh should
``weigh very seriously'' Gray's request for an independent counsel
to investigate the leaks.
   Gray, of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Democratic caucus,
issued a statement Thursday denying that he employed any
``no-show'' workers on his congressional office payroll or on the
House Budget Committee, which he chaired until January.
   Government sources, speaking only on condition they not be
named, said there is a preliminary inquiry into allegations of
employment practices and expenditures on Gray's staff, including
allegations that the lawmaker hireda ``ghost'' employee. News
stories based on anonymous sources revealed the investigation on
Wednesday.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said, ``We have
confidence that this matter can be investigated here in this
department.''
   Gray's statement Thursday said, ``There are and were no `ghost',
`no-show' or `absentee' employees on my House or committee
payrolls.''
   The Pennsylvania Democrat has asked Thornburgh to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate the leaks ``and the motivations
of this so-called investigation arranged to occur just as I was
seeking a leadership position in the Democratic Party.''
   He called Thornburgh's promise to have an in-house investigation
``insufficient'' and added, ``There is nothing to substantiate
these unfounded charges told by cowardly anonymous sources that
there was any employee impropriety.''
   Meanwhile, attorney Lezli Baskerville said Thursday she has
never been a ``no-show'' employee of Congress and described herself
as a workaholic who always arrived early and left late.
   Ms. Baskerville read a statement denouncing what she called a
``smear campaign'' against her and Gray and criticizing past news
coverage by The Associated Press.
   Ms. Baskerville was mentioned by name this week in several news
accounts that said Justice Department investigators were interested
in employees who worked for Gray while he was budget committee
chairman.
   Ms. Baskerville said she has ``heard absolutely nothing from
Justice or the FBI.'' Gray on Thursday released an affidavit from
her in which she described the work she did for him.
   Ms. Baskerville said she was ``the first to arrive at the office
and the last to leave'' in a series of short-term jobs for members
of Congress.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kate Prinsley admits she underestimated Florence
Nightingale, the mother of modern nursing, before becoming curator
of the world's first museum of Nightingalia.
   ``I always thought she was very dull, a simpering Victorian,''
said Ms. Prinsley, whose forte was museums, not medicine. ``I had
no idea that she was, I think, a very shrewd woman, a real
operator. I had no idea she was quite so tough.''
   For those with only faded schoolbook recollections of ``The Lady
with the Lamp,'' the Florence Nightingale Museum has a tale to tell.
   Opened three months ago, it recounts, often in her own words,
how a coddled girl defied her parents for a career in which she
laid the foundations of modern nursing and instituted public health
reforms that changed hospitals worldwide.
   Her work in statistics still amazes bureaucrats. She became an
expert on India without ever going there. She wrote 200 books and
major papers, and kept working into her 90th, and last, year.
   ``She was much more than a nurse,'' says Patricia Mowbray, a
Nightingale expert. ``The horrors of the hospitals would have gone
on unchanged if she'd been just a nurse.''
   The museum is at London's St. Thomas' Hospital, home of the
nursing school Nightingale founded in 1860. Among items on display
are her medicine chest and a replica of the lamp she carried in the
Crimean War hospitals where she did her most famous work improving
conditions for the wounded and sick.
   ``What a comfort it was to see her pass,'' one soldier wrote.
``We could kiss her shadow as it fell and lay our heads on the
pillow again content.''
   Born in 1820, the moody Florence was interested in the sick from
an early age. But nice girls did not become nurses in those days.
The profession was considered disreputable. Her parents refused to
let her take it up, and she studied nursing in secret.
   ``Trust me, help me ... Give me your blessing,'' she pleaded in
a letter to her family. They did not reply.
   Not until she was 33 did she get a real nursing job, as
administrator of a small London hospital called the Institution for
the Care of Sick Gentlewomen in Distressed Circumstances.
   Nightingale reorganized it so thoroughly that when word of the
horrendous conditions at the Crimean warfront reached England, she
was asked to lead a nursing expedition.
   ``Not a sponge, nor a rag of linen, not anything have I left,''
she wrote in 1854 soon after her arrival at the dank Barrack
Hospital in Scutari, Turkey.
   But within a month she had organized proper kitchens, repaired
many of the four miles of wards, ordered soap and a screen for
operations because, she said, when a soldier due for an amputation
``sees his comrade die today under the knife, it diminishes his
chances.'' The museum recreates the scene.
   Florence Nightingale came home two years later in poor health
but a national heroine. Poems and songs were written for her and
44,000 pounds, today worth more than $1.6 million, was raised for
what would become the Nightingale School of Nursing.
   She shunned publicity, and spent most of the rest of her life as
a recluse, bedridden for many years. She never married, having
turned down the man she loved for the sake of her calling.
   But from her home she barraged the government with proposals for
hospital reform, for helping the sick and poor and for the army.
She calculated that more soldiers died in peacetime from poor
hygiene than in war, and urged such innovations as ventilation,
clean linen, and plants to lift patients' spirits.
   Her 1859 ``Notes on Hospitals'' begins: ``It may seem a strange
principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital
that it should do the sick no harm.''
   In fact, says Ms. Prinsley, Florence Nightingale's work was so
precise and detailed that health researchers still study it.
   The museum also operates as a research center and a trust that
awards grants to nurses in Britain and abroad.

   Dixon Terry, a defender of family farms
who became a power in Democratic politics, died doing what he loved
_ working the fields, friends said at his funeral.
   About 1,000 mourners, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, filled Greenfield United Methodist Church on
Thursday. The crowd overflowed to the lawn outside. Tears flowed
freely.
   ``He departed doing a good thing, with his shoes on,'' said
Jackson. ``No man conquered Dixon Terry.''
   Terry, 39, died Sunday after baling hay on his dairy farm
outside this southwest Iowa town. He was struck by lightning while
riding on a hay rack and died on a rolling hill where the view
extends for miles.
   ``If he could have picked the place, I'm sure this is what he
would have picked,'' the Rev. David Ostendorf said.
   ``If he told me once, he told me a hundred times that all he
wanted to be was a farmer,'' Ostendorf told mourners later.
   Ostendorf said Terry frequently told him that he found life as
an activist trying, and that he much preferred devoting time to
family and farm.
   Jackson returned to this town where his Iowa presidential
campaign was headquartered, this time to eulogize Terry and
declare, ``We will not forget our cause.''
   ``In the center of America's heartland rests Iowa,'' said
Jackson. ``In the center of Iowa, in its heart, rests Greenfield.
In the heart of Greenfield there stood a giant of man _ Dixon
Terry.''
   Jackson recalled his campaign and the help he got from Terry,
saying: ``All of that explosion came from a germ of a seed planted
in the still of the night in this church by Dixon Terry.''
   Terry graduated from Radcliffe High School in 1968 and attended
Iowa State University where he pondered getting an advanced degree
and becoming a professor.
   But he got caught up in the civil-rights and anti-war movement
and dropped out of school after 2{ years. He worked as a garbageman
and grew his red hair past his shoulders. He returned to the
Radcliffe area to work on his family's farm. Then, he bought a farm
near Greenfield in 1977.
   Jay Howe, a Greenfield lawyer and Democratic activist, recalled
meeting him for the first time in 1980.
   ``My first impression wasn't entirely positive,'' Howe said
during a eulogy as he noted he was turned off by Terry's
wire-rimmed glasses and his long red pony tail.
   But after getting to know Terry, Howe was impressed by Terry's
community involvement, his devotion to his family and his political
leanings.
   Terry was founder of the Iowa Farm Unity Coalition and head of
the National Family Farm Coalition.
   He forged an alliance among church, labor and farm groups to
draw attention to farmers' financial problems. And he served as a
delegate to the 1984 Democratic National Convention, where he
founded a coalition to push farm issues in the party's platform.
   Terry attracted a lot of attention in 1987 when he invited
Jackson to speak in Greenfield as his first campaign trip of the
1988 race.
   To be sure, not everyone agreed with Terry, who some considered
a radical and troublemaker. And Harkin recalled political battles
he fought with Terry.
   ``He could cut through the baloney and blue smoke of politics,''
said Harkin. ``He understood politics is about power and his
lifelong goal was to give farmers more power.
   ``He cared about his family and community, he saw that true
independence was not possible unless farmers joined together.''
   Farm activists and friends also honored Terry.
   ``He was a man of extraordinary talents and ability who fought a
war within our own country,'' said Gary Lamb of the Iowa Farmers
Union. ``He fought that war as well as any man I've ever known,
this gentle giant.''
   Friends said Terry's farm was being tended by neighbors. And
since Terry left behind a $300,000 debt on the farm, a fund had
been set up for his survivors _ his wife, Linda, and 17-year-old
daughter, Willow, and 13-year-old son, Dusky _ and the troubled
family farm.
   From the altar, Jackson made a pitch for the fund, directly
addressing Mrs. Terry:
   ``We will make sure you do not lose your farm. ... We have an
obligation to Dixon.''

   With the Texas influence in Washington waning
as House Speaker Jim Wright prepares to leave Congress, the state's
other powerful allies say they're ready for some heavy lifting to
fill the void.
   ``Fortunately, Texas is blessed by having many spokesmen in
Washington, including the president and Cabinet officers and agency
heads,'' says Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``So this is clearly a
setback, but if everybody works hard I believe we can still get the
job done.''
   Wright resigned Wednesday in an emotional speech in which he
denied the findings of the House ethics committee, which charged he
violated House rules of conduct in 69 instances.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, said Wright's loss means a
heavier burden for him as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee
because of its broad jurisdiction.
   ``Where I could count on Jim Wright to pick up that part over
there on the House side, along with the members of the Texas
delegation, he had an extra bit of muscle as speaker. So it'll be
up to the rest of us to make up for that,'' said Bentsen, who
chairs the Senate's most influential committee.
   Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, said: ``We've lost an important
spokesman for our agenda which means the rest us of us have to link
together, work a little harder and make it happen.''
   Chapman says Texas will be losing the vigilant eye of someone
who could spot and stop ``the late hour mischief that can occur in
this place, or the possibility of late hour mischief.''
   Wright also was able to restore a battered piece of Texas
legislation to its original state as it neared a final vote in the
House, Chapman said.
   ``The speaker has a tremendous influence in that process and can
influence that process,'' Chapman said.
   ``Anytime I would go to him with something for my district or
Texas, I always had a friendly ear and that helped. He never turned
his back. He always gave you effort and you felt it; not just a
token effort, he swung hard when he swung,'' said Rep. Ralph Hall,
D-Texas.
   Hall also bemoaned the loss of former Sen. John Tower of Texas,
whose nomination as secretary of defense was rejected by the Senate
amid allegations of conflict of interest, womanizing and excessive
drinking.
   ``At the beginning of the year, we had the secretary of
commerce, the president, and two of the best U.S. senators in the
Senate,'' Hall said.
   ``That's quite an array. We've had two major players now that
are out of the action and President Bush tied up with NATO problems
in Europe. A lot falls back on the shoulders of those two senators,
who really have to give us leadership,'' Hall said.
   In addition to Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and President
Bush, other Texans in power include Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, House Agriculture
Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Jack Brooks, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, and Rep. Mickey Leland, chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger.
   ``Losing Jim Wright is the loss of an effective ally on Texas
issues,'' Gramm said. ``But I believe Texas still has strong
representation in Washington and if those of us representing Texas
in Washington work harder, we can protect and promote the interests
of our state, but it will be harder.''

   A 36-year-old truck driver remained in

   Local newspapers said Lamyong Ruangwong grabbed the 18-month-old

while he held the girl in one arm.
   Officials said Lamyong twice shot at police but later gave up

   Lamyong was described by authorities as an amphetamine addict
who had been fired from his job shortly before the incident.
   He was charged with abduction, attempted murder, trespassing,
theft and possession and illegal use of a firearm, police said.

   Richard Gephardt is banking on his national
reputation and youthful appeal as a ``new generation'' congressman
in seeking Democratic support to become the next House majority
leader.
   Gephardt, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1988, said in
an interview Thursday that he is ``encouraged'' by the backing he
has received so far from Democratic colleagues.
   ``The feedback has been positive, but I'm surely not prepared to
say that we've done it,'' said Gephardt.
   The 48-year-old Missourian is running against Rep. Ed Jenkins,
D-Ga., for the No. 2 leadership post to replace Rep. Thomas Foley
of Washington, who is expected to become House speaker next week.
   The leadership scramble, which had been taking shape behind the
scenes, boiled into the open this week with the announcement by
House Speaker Jim Wright's resignation announcement.
   Gephardt publicly launched his campaign with a letter to
Democrats, an appeal for change that stressed his background as one
of the new breed of American politicians who have risen to power in
the post-Watergate era.
   ``John Kennedy said in 1961 that it was time for a new
generation of Americans to lead our country,'' Gephardt wrote.
``Now I believe it is time for a new generation of members to lead
the Congress.''
   He noted that, like himself, two-thirds of current House members
have been elected since 1978, and he described the Democrats as a
``young and vibrant majority.'' Jenkins, 56, also was elected in
1978 and serves with Gephardt on the House Ways and Means Committee.
   Gephardt said he would not seek the 1992 presidential nomination
if he becomes majority leader and said in the letter he would
``devote all of my energies to the work of the House.''
   Some Democrats were annoyed at Gephardt's prolonged absence from
the House during last year's presidential campaign, when he was
head of the party caucus, the No. 4 leadership job. He served four
years in that post.
   Gephardt said he had been seriously considering another run for
the White House, but decided to seek the House post because it was
the ``best way'' to tackle a wide range issues before the country.
   ``I am not going to use a House leadership position as a
stepping stone to something else,'' Gephardt said.
   ``I haven't said this about '92 because I thought it was
necessary to get elected but because I believe that you can't do
two things at once of this magnitude. You can't be an effective
majority leader and be running for president. It's just that
simple.''
   Gephardt's allies contend he would serve as an articulate
spokesman for the party in the television age of sound-bite
politics. He earned a name for himself as an early advocate of
politically attractive issues such as tax reform and a champion of
a get-tough trade policy, which became the centerpiece of his
presidential campaign.
   ``I think I have learned how to put together coalitions in the
House so we can reach consensus in the Congress and be able to
assert a policy,'' said Gephardt. ``I also have learned something
about conveying an issue to voters in the country at large.''
   Gephardt also is viewed as one of the party's few potential
leaders who have been certified by a presidential campaign as free
of any ethical problems that could cause Democrats further
embarrassment.
   He said he decided to jump into the leadership race over the
weekend after learning from news accounts that Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., the majority whip, was resigning from the House in order
to avoid a lengthy investigation into his own personal finances.
   Before that, he had decided not to challenge Coelho for the post
because of their friendship and instead was considering running for
whip, the No. 3 leadership job.

   The House Democrats are trying to elect new
leaders in an atmosphere of suspicion that shows few signs of
abating despite the resignation of Speaker Jim Wright.
   Rep. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., certain to replace Wright as speaker
in an election scheduled for Tuesday, said he hoped to return the
House ``to a mood of mutual respect and conciliation between the
parties.''
   Wright, in a luncheon with reporters, said, ``There has to come
an end, there must come an end'' to the use of ethics as a
political weapon. ``Do I believe that's going to happen overnight
because I said it? No, I do not.''
   Democrats had hoped Wright's resignation, which followed the
resignation of the No. 3 Democrat, Rep. Tony Coelho of California,
also because of controversy over personal finances, would put the
ethics issue behind them.
   So they were angered Thursday about news reports that the
Justice Department was checking personnel practices in the office
of Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the fourth-ranking
House leader and now candidate for Coelho's slot in the coming
succession.
   ``The Democrats very clearly believe this is a concerted,
planned, coordinated effort. It is a continuation of the 1988
campaign. I think there is certainly a feeling now that the White
House is accountable,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., a member of
the Democratic leadership.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., sent a letter to the
Justice Department decrying the leaks in the Gray case.
   But Republicans, who caucused Thursday to discuss ethics,
otherwise made clear they saw no reason to let go of the issue with
which they have been battering the Democrats for months.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who launched the ethics investigation
which eventually brought down Wright, said Thursday he was ``angry
at the tone'' of Wright's speech before the House on Wednesday.
   Wright's calling it ``mindless cannibalism'' that had engulfed
him was ``an insult to the ethics committee and every decent person
in the House... It was not mindless, it was very serious,'' said
Gingrich, who as the House Minority Whip is Michel's next in
command.
   Gingrich said while Justice Department leaks of the case
involving Gray were wrong, the political parties could ``police
each other'' by checking into possible wrongdoing by the
opposition. ``Jim Wright's a symbol of how sick the Congress has
become,'' he said.
   While some clearly remained in a confrontational mode, others
said the point of deepest angst had passed with Wright's
resignation.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the speaker's announcement
was ``a catharsis.''
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called on those ``couple of dozen
members'' who have been badmouthing the House to stop.``I think
it's time for the members of this House who don't want to serve
here to leave,'' he said.
   With Foley running for speaker, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is
promising to stay and serve if he's elected Majority Leader.
Gephardt ran for president in 1988 but is promising to stay in the
House and forego another attempt in 1992.
   Gephardt, who is battling Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., for Majority
Leader, said in a letter to colleagues Thursday that he ``was not
interested in wallowing in rumor or engaging in partisan intrigue.''
   He wrapped himself in Foley's coattails, pledging to work with
his popular colleague to install a ``new generation'' of leaders in
the House.
   The race for Majority Whip includes Gray, who is now the
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus; David Bonior, the Chief
Deputy Whip, and Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., the chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., was also assessing his chances.
   ``Will Bill Gray be able to hold his troops? That's the
question,'' said Schumer, alluding to the bad publicity Gray had to
explain to jittery Democrats. ``So far, there aren't many
defections.''
   While election of a new speaker by the Democrats and the full
House has been scheduled for Tuesday, no date has been set for
Democrats to choose their party leadership posts.
   Lawmakers said it would most likely occur a week or more after
the speaker's election.

<HEAD>Georgia Boy Hits Pay Dirt in His Call for `Kids' Day'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eleven-year-old Larry Banister II is
acknowledged to be the most precocious promoter in this old gold
mining community now that his efforts in behalf of Kids' Day have
begun to hit pay dirt.
   And this definitely is a gold letter day for the blond,
curley-haired boy from Dahlonega. Not only is today his 11th
birthday and the last day of the school term. But thanks to Larry,
it's also Children Appreciation Day in Juneau, Alaska.
   Larry has a personal copy of the proclamation issued by Juneau
Mayor Bruce Botelho.
   ``He's one of the mayors I wrote, asking him to proclaim a Kids'
Day,'' said the talkative fifth grader with no doubts about being
promoted to sixth grade.
   What Larry's really interested in promoting at the moment is
Kids' Day. During the past year or so, he has written hundreds of
letters to politicians across the country, asking them to set aside
a special day to honor kids.
   ``I got the idea a couple of years ago, on Grandparents Day,''
he said as he lounged on a couch in the office of his family's
mortuary.
   ``We were told at school that it was Grandparents Day,'' he
recalled. ``I said to myself, `There's a Mother's Day, and a
Father's Day, even a Grandparents Day, so why not have a day
honoring children? After all, we're the hope of the future, the
ones who are going to have to clean up all this mess the older
generation is leaving us.'''
   Not being one to mess around himself, he sat right down and
began his letter writing.
   ``I wore out three typewriter ribbons and used up all my dad's
stationery,'' he said. ``I got the names and addresses of the state
legislators from my grandfather, who was the county coroner at the
time. And I used my World Alamanac to get the zip codes of all the
big cities and sent those letters `In Care of the Mayor.'''
   It wasn't long before his efforts paid off. Dahlonega officials
proclaimed Oct. 15 as Kids' Day. Officials in nearby Dawsonville
followed suit on Dec. 6.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris fell into line with a statewide Kids' Day
on Dec. 8.
   Larry said Hawaii County, Hawaii, declared May 19 to be Kids'
Day, ``but Georgia is the only state I've gotten so far.''
   What he's shooting for is a national Kids' Day, maybe even an
non-paid holiday honoring kids. He badgered his congressman,
Democratic Rep. Ed Jenkins, into offering a resolution last year
but the proposal failed.
   This year, however, a similar resolution was offered by Rep.
Joseph P. Kennedy III, D-Mass. The proposal, which would have the
second Sunday in October national Childrens' Day, was approved by a
voice vote in the House on May 9 and was sent to the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   A spokesman in Kennedy's office said the congressman was
influenced by his 8-year-old twin sons ``who thought there should
be a day honoring children.''
   Larry said he doesn't care what date is chosen but he wants it
to be called ``Kids' Day.''
   ``It's a punchier name,'' he said, adding he'll go to Washington
to lobby the Senate if the resolution doesn't get action soon.
   His mom, Joyce Banister, said she wouldn't be surprised at
anything her son does.
   ``We're real proud of Larry,'' she said. ``He's always reading
or playing with his computer. He also likes soccer but what he
really likes is politics.''
   Larry, who's sure he'll have his own political career someday,
has even tried to enlist President Bush, although he hasn't been
able to reach the president.
   ``However, I have heard from more than 150 state legislators
around the country,'' he said. ``Almost all of them told me they
liked my idea for a Kids' Day. Though one old sour puss did tell me
it wasn't necessary because every day is kids' day. He did admit,
though, that he probably sounded like a parent.''

<HEAD>Eastern Agrees To Pay $3 Million To End Pension-Tapping Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines will pay $3.1 million to
several of its benefit plans to settle a case in which the
government alleged the carrier illegally tapped employee funds to
pay corporate expenses.
   The bankrupt airline could face up to another $5.5 million in
bills to cover the costs of audits it agreed to conduct for the
past three years as well as through 1994.
   Eastern, still operating a skeleton schedule three months into a
strike by its Machinists union, entered into a consent agreement
with the Labor Department on Thursday without admitting or denying
it violated its duties under federal pension laws.
   The cash-poor airline issued a statement saying the ``alleged
technical violations'' were discovered after a 1987 internal audit
and that it voluntarily brought them to the attention of the Labor
Department.
   Because Eastern has filed for court protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, the settlement will
have to be approved by a bankruptcy court in New York.
   The Labor Department complaint alleged that beginning in 1977
Eastern violated its trust responsibilities through an informal
arrangement in which it used insurance commissions earned by its
welfare plans to offset actuarial expenses of the company. It also
alleged that Eastern paid its remaining corporate actuarial
expenses from assets of its pension plans.
   Specifically, the complaint said Eastern violated federal
pension laws by:
   _Using $2.1 million in commissions generated by insurance
policies of the welfare plans to offset what it owed to a company
known as Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen Inc. for corporate and
pension-related work. The welfare plans, funded entirely with
employee contributions, provide travel and long-term disability
insurance to Eastern workers.
   _Causing defined-benefit plans to pay for actuarial services
related to Eastern's corporate affairs, including $250,000 for work
unrelated to the benefit plans.
   _Receiving excessive fees for administrating the travel accident
plan from 1975 to 1987.
   _Failing to file reports required by the government for the
travel accident plan.
   Under terms of the order, Eastern must pay into escrow accounts
$675,285 for the disability plan and $1.8 million for the travel
accident plan. Also, the company must pay another $591,713 to seven
of its 11 defined benefits plans.
   Eastern also agreed to pay up to $800,000 a year for annual
audits between now and 1994 and up to another $1.5 million for
audits covering the past three years.
   Results of those audits are to be included in reports Eastern
must file for the next five years demonstrating its compliance with
the pension laws. The agreement requires Eastern to hire a third
party acceptable to the Labor Department to prepare the reports.
   Eastern also was permanently barred from using assets of
employee benefit plans to pay for corporate expenses.
   Mercer-Meidinger, which was not a party to the case, agreed in a
side letter to establish a compliance unit responsible for
implementing a program to assure that it does not allow violations
of the pension laws. The complaint did not cite the company but
alleged Eastern had an informal arrangement with Mercer-Meidinger
that led to the alleged violations.

<HEAD>Union Threatens Sears Boycott; Demands End of `Sears Post Office'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union representing 365,000 postal workers
says its members will slice up any Sears, Roebuck and Co. credit
cards they hold and boycott the retail giant unless it removes mini
post offices from 11 of its stores.
   The American Postal Workers Union said Thursday it also was
considering asking for a nationwide labor boycott of Sears if it
ignored the demand.
   ``We view this as a menace to postal jobs and postal workers and
the general public,'' union President Moe Biller said in a
telephone interview. ``Sears today, K-Mart tomorrow, Wal-Mart the
next day and JC Penney after that. Then the time would come when
they say we don't need any post office retail windows.''
   The Sears pilot program began in October. Biller said he has
complained privately to the Postal Service and Sears but was
mounting a public campaign now because postal officials informed
him last week as many as 100 more of the in-store counters are
planned.
   A Sears spokeswoman said the Chicago-based retailer planned to
continue the pilot program at least through its one-year
anniversary in October but said he knew of no expansion plans.
   Postal Service spokesman Ralph Stewart said when the program
began the agency said it would add more postal counters in Sears
stores if the experiment proved successful. But he said he was not
aware of any current plans to add more.
   In a publication mailed APWU members this week, Biller urged the
postal workers to sign and mail a form letter addressed to Sears
Chairman Edward A. Brennan.
   ``Your company's pilot postal venture with the USPS is nothing
less than an attempt to replace us with a low-wage, nonunion work
force,'' the letter said. ``It is a classic example of how
union-busting managers use privatization to try to crush trade
unions for the benefit of profiteers.''
   The 11 postal counters in Sears stores now are confined to the
Chicago area and Madison, Wis. The counters are run by nonunion
Sears employees.
   ``We feel the issue is one between the union and Postal Service
management,'' Sears spokeswoman Mary Jean Houde said. ``We do
regret of course that the postal union feels it necessary to
threaten this action.''
   In a statement, the Postal Service said the units at Sears and
6,000 like them nationwide, largely in neighborhood drug and
convenience stores, were designed to benefit consumers.
   ``They are helping us provide greater convenience to a very
broad segment of the public, often during hours that post offices
are not open,'' the statement said. ``We believe it represents the
best interests of our employees and we want to assure them that
nothing about these efforts is a threat to their job security.''

<HEAD>Lautenberg: Global Environmental Impact Should Be Government Focus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Jersey senator is urging the federal
government to assess the impact on the environment _ at home and
abroad _ when undertaking development projects, saying failure to
do so goes against Bush administration claims.
   ``The president seems unable to take the simple action of
ordering federal agencies to consider this and other global
environmental issues in their impact statements,'' Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J. said. ``This failure undercuts the
administration's claims to be moving aggressively and to be taking
a leadership role in addressing the consequences of global
warming.''
   During a hearing Thursday on reauthorization of the National
Environmental Policy Act, Lautenberg noted the Bush administration
was failing to act on its stated intention to target worldwide
environmental threats.
   Lautenberg brought before his Superfund subcommittee two
reauthorization bills stepping up consideration of environmental
impact when federal actions are involved.
   The first bill, introduced earlier in the day by Lautenberg and
Sens. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., and John Chafee, R-R.I., would
strengthen the power of the Council on Environmental Quality, a
body that advises the president. The amended measure also would
authorize the council to issue regulations assuring environmental
impact statements address such global issues as ozone depletion and
the greenhouse effect.
   The second measure, introduced earlier in the session by Sen.
Steven D. Symms, R-Idaho, would require multilateral banks, such as
the World Bank, to conduct environmental assessments before
undertaking foreign projects.
   A. Alan Hill, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality,
which advises the president on environmental matters, said he was
unsure whether the council should be responsible for actions on
global warming.
   ``I don't know if it's the best to deal off an issue to the
council,'' he said. ``It's up to the president to make one place
the coordinating body.''
   Hill, who leaves his post in June after eight years, said he
believed the United States should cooperate with other nations to
press banks for environmental impact statements on foreign
development projects, such as construction of dams.
   ``If we stand up alone, our chances of success are less. If we
all get together, it's the bigger wallet,'' he said.
   Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, testified that
the Council on Environmental Quality should be strengthened.
   ``We believe it is urgent that the president revive CEQ, and we
hope he will ask for the resources needed to rebuild its staff to
between 40 and 50 people. We hope too that the Congress will
provide the funding for this.''
   McCloskey said the council, which shrank in manpower and impact
in the past decade, but should assume the lead role in devising
initiatives for the president on global climate changes, ozone,
forest losses, pollution and management of public lands.
   However, Edwin L. Johnson, director of the developing countries
staff for the Office of International Activities of the
Environmental Protection Agency, objected to such requirements,
which could be interpreted as outside interference from the United
States.
   He said some changes in the legislation ``leave the bill still
open to criticism by the multilateral development banks and
borrowing nations as a unilateral imposition of U.S. standards.''

<HEAD>Pepper's Compassion, Vision Praised at Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle and members of
Congress praised Rep. Claude Pepper's compassion and vision as they
and thousands of other Americans paid final respects to the
champion of the elderly.
   ``This week's loss is tomorrow's legend,'' Quayle said. ``We
honor him best not by praising him today but by following his
example in the years ahead.''
   Pepper, who died of stomach cancer Tuesday at age 88, lay in
state in the Capitol Rotunda Thursday and today. For hours, people
filed past the open casket in tribute.
   Among those lauding Pepper at a brief memorial service Thursday
was resigning House Speaker Jim Wright, who said he became a
disciple of the Florida Democrat after first hearing him speak in
1944.
   ``In an age of cynicism, Claude Pepper believed his life made a
difference _ and what a difference it made,'' Wright, D-Texas said.
``His event-filled life seemed to mirror the best-celebrated traits
of Americans: ambition, honest toil, optimism for the future and
compassion.''
   Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine said Pepper's
death marks the passing of an era in American history.
   ``To the 101st Congress, from the early days of the Roosevelt
Administration, when the energies of the federal government were
turned to the tasks of dealing with a nation `one-third ill-housed,
ill-clothed, and ill-fed,' Claude Pepper never forgot his duty as
an elected official to fight for the common welfare,'' Mitchell
said.
   Pepper is only the 27th American to lie in state in the rotunda
and only the second to have his casket open as had Army Gen.
Douglas H. MacArthur. His flag-draped casket was quietly carried
into the rotunda by members of the four armed services and placed
on a wooden catafalque draped in black velvet with silk cord and
fringe.
   Pepper's family, members of Congress and his staff encircled the
open casket for the service.
   Many of those filing past Pepper's casket had personal memories
of the lawmaker, while others claimed only to benefit from his
lifelong battles for Social Security and other pensions,
catastrophic health insurance and other laws aimed at helping the
poor and the elderly.
   ``He's done so much for other people, including me,'' said Henry
Thomas of Washington. ``Because of him, I am able to live with my
pensions. It's helpful for me and my wife.''
   There will be an additional viewing in Miami on Saturday and in
Tallahassee, Fla., on Sunday before burial Monday.

<HEAD>Interior Department Orders Strict Fire Control For Parks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department is ordering strict
fire control for national parks and wilderness areas, saying last
summer's ``let it burn'' policy was ``impractical and
unprofessional.''
   A joint directive, embracing a task force report, was issued
Thursday by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter, whose department has jurisdiction over
national forests.
   There have been sizeable fires in national parks and forests
already this spring in a number of states including Texas, Florida,
Wyoming and Colorado.
   Summer fire conditions ``are being watched very closely,'' said
George Berklacy, a spokesman for the National Park Service. He
added, however, that climate and other conditions give no
suggestion that the fire season will be anywhere near as
devastating as last year.
   The task force, which was called to review federal fire
management policies after last summer's fires at Yellowstone, had
concluded that there are environmental benefits to allowing
controlled fires, but that greater assurances must be shown that a
fire cannot get out of control before it is allowed to burn.
   The Interior Department endorsed all 15 recommendations of the
task force, including one which called for stronger fire management
policies and a ban on even controlled fires until the improvement
management plans are put into effect.
   Department spokesmen said all 26 national parks that have major
fire prevention programs are preparing the tighter fire management
programs outlined by the task force and no controlled fires will be
allowed to burn in a park until the improved programs are in place.
   ``If a fire occurs at Yellowstone it will be fought immediately
and be put out,'' said Berklacy. He said he doubted that the
prohibition against controlled, or ``prescribed'', fires will be
lifted this summer in any of the parks.
   There has been a moratorium on controlled fires in federal parks
and wilderness areas since last August as a result of the
controversy that erupted after the fires at Yellowstone.
   While the new federal fire policy continues to endorse the ``let
it burn'' philosophy in theory, it calls for tighter controls on
such fires including more stringent monitoring to lessen the
likelihood of a fire raging out of control.
   Once the improved fire management programs are put into effect,
officials at parks may allow some fires to burn under strict
control, the department said. But among the added precautions are
that a senior official at each park must closely monitor such a
fire and ``certify in writing daily that ... adequate resources are
available to ensure that ... the fire will remain within prescribed
boundaries and conditions.''
   ``If these conditions cannot be met, the fire shall be declared
a wildfire and suppressed,'' said the department.
   The task force, whose recommendations were broadly endorsed
Thursday by the Interior Department, was assembled last September
after the worst fire season ever at Yellowstone National Park.
During the summer more than 200 fires seared an estimated 1.3
million acres of the park and surrounding national forests.
   Local officials sharply criticized the federal government for
failing to bring the fires under control and put some of the blame
on the longstanding ``let it burn'' policies.
   Many scientists have defended the practice of allowing certain
fires to burn unless they threaten human life, homes or villages.
They argue that such fires are part of a natural cycle, rid the
forest of brush and fallen trees that may cause more severe fires
in the future, and, in fact, cause less damage than many people
might expect.

   The man known here as Robert P. Clark was
a quiet, hard-working, church-going man.
   So neighbors were shocked when FBI agents came looking for him
Thursday, saying he was John E. List and was wanted for the
slayings of his family nearly 18 years ago.
   ``I don't know what a guy who's killed five people is supposed
to look like, but he was not that person,'' said Pat Ferguson, who
lives two doors from the man she knew as Clark in this Richmond
suburb.
   The agents didn't find List at home, but arrested him later at
the Richmond accounting firm where he worked.
   He was charged with fleeing to avoid prosecution. He faces five
counts of first-degree murder in New Jersey for the 1971 shooting
deaths of his mother, wife and three children in Westfield.
   The FBI said List, 63, was identified by his fingerprints. He
was ordered jailed pending a Monday bond hearing.
   The arrest, which resulted from tips from viewers of the Fox
television program ``America's Most Wanted,'' stunned neighbors and
co-workers of the balding, bespectacled accountant.
   ``You talk about an average neighborhood, this is it,'' said
Ferguson, who described Clark as a good neighbor.
   ``He worked hard in his yard, went to work every day, went to
church every Sunday. The guy was so average,'' Ferguson said.
   Clark and his wife, Delores, moved into the area last July from
Colorado, neighbors said. They had not yet gotten around to
painting their name on the rust-colored mailbox in front of their
small blue ranch house.
   Joseph and Jacqueline Stefano said the Clarks were good,
hardworking people who did not like to talk about their past.
   ``We thought they were normal people _ like us,'' Mrs. Stefano
said.
   The two families did odd jobs for each other and exchanged books
and videotapes, Stefano said. An American flag hanging in front of
the Stefano's house was a gift from Clark, he said.
   Clark often would call up and recommend a particular movie or
television show, Stefano said. One of his picks was ``America's
Most Wanted,'' but Stefano missed the program the week List was
featured.
   The Clarks had been married since 1983, Mrs. Stefano said. Mrs.
Clark had told her that Clark's first wife had died and that he had
no children from either marriage.
   Clark ``just seemed like a very, very nice fellow,'' said a
woman who worked with him at the Maddrea, Joyner, Kirkham &amp; Woody
accounting firm. She said she ``would hold him up to my husband as
a model because I heard him talk to his wife on the phone. He would
say how much he loved her.''
   Another co-worker said Clark ``even had a Fraternal Order of
Police sticker on his car.''

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped sharply
Friday, while the U.S. dollar declined against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,667.42, falling
313.93 points or 0.92 percent.
   The dollar finished trading at 141.80 yen, 0.72 yen below its
finish on Thursday. It opened at 142.12 yen and ranged between
141.32 and 142.15 yen during the day.
   A trader with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo said the dollar fell as
speculative investors sold it for profit-taking.
   ``Japanese investors sold the dollar today more than we have
expected, but most of them are making position adjustments,'' he
added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The majority of market players avoided major moves ahead of the
U.S. jobless report, the trader added. The United States is to
announce the nation's unemployment rate for May later Friday in
Washington.
   On the stock exchange, ``the index started to fall as investors'
wait-and-see mood became stronger,'' said Nikko Securities' dealer
Yoshio Shimoyama.
   ``The Nikkei's early gain was just a rebound effect from
yesterday's plunge, and the market today was lacking buying
incentives,'' he said.
   Market players avoided buying issues ahead of the release of the
jobless report, Shimoyama said.
   ``Although the dollar-yen rate, which has been investors' major
concern, has stabilized pretty much, now they are more concerned
about the jobless rate,' he said.

   Candidates for governor shalt not take the
Lord's name in vain on live television. Or they'll answer to their
mothers.
   ``Jesus Christ!'' blurted out former state Attorney General Cary
Edwards, frustrated at repeated interruptions from state Sen.
Gerald Cardinale during a debate for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination.
   That night, Edwards' mother called to chide him about the
outburst.
   ``Mom, if you had to sit up there with those guys, you'd invoke
the Lord's name, too,'' Edwards said he told her.
   Edwards' fellow candidates also have had their embarrassing
moments and comic interludes.
   U.S. Rep. James Courter told viewers of a GOP debate two weeks
ago of his ``seven- or nine-point plan'' to combat drugs. Within a
minute, he upped the ante to an 11-point program, leaving advisers
shaking their heads.
   Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick, briefly turned the verbal
warfare into a physical contest when he seized Courter's wrist,
preventing the obviously startled congressman from gesturing.
   Cardinale, a dentist, tried to show he's a man of his stripe in
illustrating his opposition to abortion.
   ``I believe as a scientist that this thing we call a fetus has
the same genes and chromosomes as you and I have,'' he said. ``What
distinquishes you and me from a zebra is those genes and
chromosomes, and you will never be a zebra as long as you have
those genes and chromosomes, and neither will I.''
   Perhaps the most humbling exchange came off-camera when state
Sen. William Gormley asked his 12-year-old son if he planned to
watch one of the debates.
   ``But Dad,'' pleaded the younger Gormley. ``It's up against
`Unsolved Mysteries.'''
   The candidates have fired carefully crafted one-liners aimed at
grabbing air time and scoring hits on one another.
   Hardwick called Edwards a ``General Custer'' in the losing war
on drugs.
   Edwards called Hardwick a legislative ``Santa Claus'' who makes
politically profitable promises to everyone but fails to say how he
will pay for them.
   ``Any chicken can pass a bill without a funding source,''
Gormley chimed in.
   Courter said state lawmakers have created the auto insurance
crisis, so asking them to fix it is like someone with a stiff neck
asking the Boston Strangler for a massage.
   The rollicking Republican exchanges have grown so heated that
the raucous debate continued into commercial breaks during a taping
last week.
   ``And you thought Republicans were boring,'' Gormley said.
   The televised Democratic exchanges have been much tamer, but
frequently featured Assemblyman Alan Karcher and Princeton Mayor
Barbara Sigmund ganging up on front-runner James Florio.
   Viewers may still be scratching their heads over U.S. Rep.
Florio's answer when asked whether he would agree to a third
televised debate.
   ``Well, I will make a determination as to what it is that I'm
going to be able to do at any particular time to be able to
communicate my message out there. That leaves a situation wherein
you have the opportunity to go talk to people, and if you have that
opportunity, you should take it,'' said Florio, who has been
accused by his two opponents of dodging them on the campaign trail.
   He said he would look forward to future forums, but added: ``I
will give you an answer at the appropriate time as to was it is
we're doing at the time we're conducting the debate.''
   His campaign the next day offered this translation: I don't know.
   Florio later agreed to two more debates.
   The Democrats also have grabbed their share of catchy sound
bites.
   Karcher charged Florio: ``You are the boss in south Jersey and I
think any one who would not believe that would have also to believe
in the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny.''
   Florio, asked to promise to refrain from negative campaigning,
said: ``I don't start street fights, but I don't walk away from
them.''
   Sigmund, who contributed numerous flippant comments, said of
President Reagan's professed love of local governments while he cut
state aid:
   ``I've heard about love from sweet-talking men for a long time,
and I'd rather have the money.''

<HEAD>Coast Guard Chief Says He's Pleased With Spill Cleanup</HEAD>

   The Coast Guard commandant said Exxon is
making progress in cleaning up its huge oil spill off the Alaskan
coast, but the state's top conservation official said a lot more
work needs to be done.
   ``I'm seeing a massive project that appears to be well run,''
Adm. Paul Yost said Thursday after touing Prince William Sound
beaches.
   The state's commissioner for environmental conservation said
Exxon has increased its effort but is not through gearing up for
the job.
   ``We think there's a long way to go both inside and outside
Prince William Sound,'' Dennis Kelso said.
   Meanwhile, a rule went into effect Thursday requiring alcohol
tests for skippers and other tanker crew members who might operate
oil-laden vessels through the sound. Shipping companies are to hire
contractors who will administer the tests.
   The requirement is part of an interim set of state rules
established after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 in
the sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil. Its
captain, Joseph Hazelwood, failed sobriety tests administered more
than 10 hours after the accident. The vessel's third mate was
operating the ship when it ran aground.
   Yost, making his fourth visit to contaminated beaches as a
chilly rain fell, was accompanied by Otto Harrison, Exxon's general
manager in Valdez, and Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the
federal on-scene coordinator of the cleanup.
   During a visit to Homer on Wednesday, Yost said the company
almost certainly will miss its Sept. 15 deadline for oil cleanup.
   Robbins said Exxon has been doing a good job logistically in the
sound, but perhaps should be prodded to do more on south-central
Alaska beaches outside the sound.
   Exxon has the money and means to get the job done, Robbins said,
and that leads him ``farther away from the idea of federalizing''
the cleanup. Some critics of Exxon's performance contend the
government should take over the project.
   At Smith Island _ one of the most heavily oiled beaches and one
that drew the most effort early in the cleanup _ rocks, sand and
gravel remained coated with oil Thursday, and an oily sheen washed
off the shore.
   Exxon officials classified the beach as ``environmentally
clean.'' That means birds, seals and otters are not picking up more
oil from the beach, Harrison said.
   He said crews have cleaned 20 miles of beach inside the sound
and about 50 miles outside. State officials said more than 700
miles were contaminated. Exxon has said it will be able to clean
just over 350 miles.
   Yost was confronted by residents Wednesday when he visited some
coastal communities of south-central Alaska. People were angry that
he called Exxon's logistical work good, he said.
   After a meeting with state and Exxon officials later Thursday,
Yost said that more work needs to be done, but he is impressed by
the technology being used in the cleanup.
   ``It's a disaster that doesn't lend itself to restoration very
quickly or very easily, and there will not be a complete
restoration this summer, either in Prince William Sound or probably
outside of Prince William Sound,'' Yost said.

after his British stage debut as Shylock in Shakespeare's play,
``The Merchant of Venice.''
   While the production won cheers Thursday night from a
celebrity-studded first-night audience at London's Phoenix Theater,
critic Irving Wardle wrote in The Times of London today:
   ``All the clamorous hype and slavering expectation is a poor
preparation for the modest Shylock who arrived on the Phoenix stage
last night ... Hoffman's is much the most genial Shylock that I
have seen ...
   ``What does not come off are the directly emotional climaxes,
which strain his voice to the limit and substitute rhetoric ... for
his particular and priceless capacity for expressing the secrets of
a man's mind through low-key unguarded utterance.''
   Michael Billington said in The Guardian: ``Although Mr.
Hoffman's humorous approach pays handsome dividends ... it also
means a loss of the tragic dimension. ... What it lacks is any
strong sense of the character's inveterate malignity.''
   Jack Tinker wrote in the London tabloid the Daily Mail:
``Without being great, he is most certainly good.''
   Lester Middlehurst, writing in Today, another tabloid, said:
``Hoffman's Shylock is ... fascinating.''
   The production was by Sir Peter Hall, who directed the National
Theater in London from 1973 until last year.
   Hoffman agreed to the part of Shylock but said after studying
the play that he found it very anti-Semitic. Critics agreed today,
however, that Hoffman's portrayal had reversed this traditional
view.
   ``The manifest aim... is to show him (Shylock) as a good man
driven beyond endurance by his bestial treatment from the
Christians,'' Wardle wrote.
   The actor, who won the Oscar this year as best actor for his
performance in ``Rain Man,'' is said to receive $6 million dollars
for each film. But the British domestic agency Press Association
said Hoffman is getting paid $3,140 a week for three months in the
play.
   The first-night audience included Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Joan
Collins and ex-Beatle Paul McCartney.

<HEAD>Actor Wins ``The Sting'' Tax Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Paul Newman has beaten a $41,000 tax
bite on income from ``The Sting.''
   Newman won the tax dispute when the California Supreme Court
rejected the state's claim for a greater portion of Newman's income
from the movie.
   In unanimously denying a hearing sought by the state Franchise
Tax Board, the justices on Thursday let stand a lower-court ruling
that counted the time an actor spent ``on call'' as work time for
apportioning income.
   A non-resident such as Newman who performs personal services in
California for part of a year is taxed according to the portion of
the total working days spent in the state. If one-third of the
working days are spent in California, for example, one-third of the
income from the project is taxable by the state.
   Newman's case involved a dispute over the definition of working
days. In filming ``The Sting,'' which won an Academy Award for best
picture, Newman spent 30 days in California in 1973, 25 of them
filming and five ``on call,'' and 24 days outside California, only
two of them filming.
   In their tax returns, Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward,
described 54 days as ``working days'' and apportioned 30, or 55.5
percent, to California. But the tax board said only the 27 days of
actual filming should count as ``working days,'' and 25 of them, or
92.6 percent, were attributed to California.
   Justice Jack Goertzen said in the decision that Newman was
required to report for work by his studio at any time during the
period he was ``on call,'' and could not take any conflicting jobs.
   Newman's press agent Warren Cowan did not answer telephone calls
for comment on Thursday.
   Deputy Attorney General Richard Nielsen, who represented the tax
board, said the ruling could work against actors.
   ``Every actor that spends his time in California not doing
anything, if he's under contract to somebody else in another state,
California could pick up his income,'' Nielsen said. ``Whether the
board will pursue something like that I don't know.''

   Expensive, state-of-the-art weapons, such as
the F-16 jet fighter or the M-1 battle tank, would be redistributed
rather than destroyed if an agreement on arms reduction in central
Europe is reached with the Soviet Union, Bush administration
officials say.
   Addressing concerns expressed Thursday by members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, the officials said the cuts proposed by
Bush in NATO and Warsaw Pact forces can be accomplished by
destroying older weapons.
   ``We have enough of the older weapons that can be destroyed
without destroying newer weapons,'' said Air Force Gen. Robert T.
Herres, vice chairman of the military Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., declared: ``It doesn't make sense to
destroy $20 million F-16 fighters at a time when our reserve and
guard units are still flying 1960's vintage F-4 fighters.''
   But Herres said that will not be allowed to happen.
   ``We propose to redistribute new equipment such as F-16's and
M-1 tanks,'' he said. ``We have no intention of destroying them.
Our obvious target will be older equipment.''
   He also said there is nothing in the Bush proposal to prevent
NATO or the Soviets from modernizing the military forces that
remain after reductions.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney said in an interview
published in The Washington Post today that the United States might
wind up stressing lighter equipment for land forces to ease rapid
deployment if Bush's proposals for armed forces reductions in
Europe are accepted.
   Cheney said the proposed ceiling of 275,000 troops for both the
United States and the Soviet Union in Europe might raise other
questions, such as whether ships would be better than aircraft for
reinforcement from the United States in war.
   Though the proposal makes military sense, Cheney said he was
worried that Congress would try to double or triple the president's
proposed reduction of 30,000 U.S. troops. ``Maybe eventually we can
talk about those numbers, but not now,'' he said in the Post
interview.
   Herres and Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz commented
as a broad bipartisan cross section of the committee praised the
Bush proposal as a potentially historic breakthrough that could
sharply reduce the prospects for war in Europe.
   Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., hailed the Bush proposal as taking
``an innovative'' approach and said it will ``reduce the dangers of
war in Europe,'' while posing the possibility of creating future
savings that could eventually help the United States deal with the
budget deficit.
   The Bush proposal calls for:
   _Reductions in tanks, armored troop carriers and artillery in
the area from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains that will require
far deeper cuts by the Soviet Union and its allies than by the
United States and NATO.
   _Reductions of 15 percent below current levels of helicopters
and land-based combat planes in the Atlantic to the Urals zone.
   _A ceiling of 275,000 on U.S. and Soviet ground and air force
personnel in the zone, a ceiling which would require a reduction of
some 325,000 Soviet troops to achieve.
   _Speeding up the pace of negotiations and the implementation of
an agreement to accomplish the reductions by 1992 or 1993, about
four or five years sooner than the time table suggested by the
Soviets.
   Herres and Wolfowitz said the plan does not set a rigid
timetable which might trap the United States into accepting a bad
agreement contrary to U.S. security interests.
   And Wolfowitz said it will require verification procedures far
more intrusive than any so far put into effect for any other arms
control arrangement.
   Several committee members declared, and the administration
witnesses agreed, that no attempt should be made to cut defense
spending before agreement on the Bush proposal is reached.
   ``We've got to be very careful of not getting out in front of
reality,'' Herres said. ``But if we are successful in the arms
control adventure, we will be relieving future generations of a
considerable burden if we can defuse the situation in central
Europe in this way.''
   Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Herres remarked:
   ``If four or five years ago someone had told me we were going to
be in a position to achieve parity with the Soviet Union in five
important categories I would have walked away laughing.''

   Sousuke Uno became Japan's prime minister Friday
and pledged political reforms to clear the air of a scandal that
has decimated the top ranks of the long-governing Liberal
Democratic Party.
   The 66-year-old former foreign minister also sounded a tough
note about trade problems with the United States, saying
Washington's use of its new trade law to force concessions from
Japan was ``like negotiating with your fists up.''
   The conservative party was to get a new leadership roster and a
new Cabinet was to be installed in an effort to wipe the slate
clean of the Recruit influence-buying scandal before a national
election for half the upper house of Parliament, expected within
two months.
   The scandal erupted a year ago, ruined many careers and forced
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, 65, to resign and take
responsibility for a widespread loss of trust in politics.
   The two houses of the Diet, Japan's parliament, met separately
Friday afternoon and elected Uno prime minister on the strength of
the Liberal Democrats' large majorities.
   In the House of Representatives, Uno got 285 of 477 votes, with
Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi receiving 139, Eiichi
Nagasue of the Democratic Socialist Party 26 and Kenji Miyamoto of
the Communist Party 25. Two votes were ruled invalid.
   The upper House of Councillors gave Uno 124 of 220 votes, with
Ms. Doi capturing 65, Miyamoto 17 and Nagasue 9. Five ballots were
blank, officials announced.
   ``The Recruit scandal had a great impact, and I understand what
it means to be chosen as prime minister in such a situation,'' Uno
said. ``I would like to promise to carry forward political reforms
with all my loyalty and strength.''
   Many within the party objected to Uno because he is a senior
member of the faction of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
The scandal, involving bribes and cut-rate sales of stock in a
subsidiary of the Recruit Co. information conglomerate, developed
during Nakasone's 1982-87 administration.
   But in his acceptance speech, Uno said he was resigning from the
Nakasone faction, taking one of the steps recommended by a party
panel on reform.
   Factional rivalry within the party is regarded as one reason why
large amounts of money are needed in Japanese politics, because
factional leaders must help finance their followers' political
activities.
   Nakasone resigned from the party because of the Recruit scandal,
but he retained his seat in Parliament and analysts expect him to
retain his influence.
   Takeshita announced April 25 that he would resign, but the
search for a replacement took more than a month because of the
Recruit scandal, which reached the top levels of politics, business
and the bureaucracy. Uno agreed on Wednesday to take the job.
   Although Uno was endorsed by Takeshita and the party's power
brokers, a rebel candidate, 68-year-old lawmaker Ganri Yamashita,
was put forward Thursday by young party hawks who favor more
military spending. Yamashita is a former Defense Agency chief who
had tried to put forward an alternate candidate when the party
chose Takeshita as its leader in October 1987.
   There was no official count at Friday's meeting, attended by 341
of the party's 436 Diet members. Instead, those present stood in
response to a call for support of Uno.
   Yamashita's supporters complained of a lack of democracy and
demanded a ballot, but the leadership said the conference was
called only to endorse the decision made behind closed doors by the
party's Executive Council.
   ``The majority of the party wants to find a candidate
peacefully,'' said Ryutaro Hashimoto, the party deputy secretary
general. ``And we took it into consideration that it has to be
someone who has currency in international society. Japan must make
contributions in international society, and we have decided to
recommend Sousuke Uno.''
   The new prime minister will have a major task in convincing the
Japanese public that the Liberal Democrats will retool the
political style that let politicians and aides accept huge tax-free
profits through the purchase of pre-listed shares in 1986 in the
Recruit subsidiary.
   Three Cabinet members resigned in connection with the Recruit
scandal, and 14 people, including two former vice ministers, were
arrested on suspicion of bribery or securities exchange law
violations.
   Takeshita apologized Friday for his role in the scandal, which
has stained the top ranks of politics, business and the bureaucracy.
   ``Considering the burning anger among the Japanese people and
also some facts around me in relation to the stock scandal, I
thought it is most appropriate for me to resign if it would help to
pursue policital reforms,'' he said in a short, somber speech.
   ``I would also like to apologize to the public for all the
troubles due to my lack of discretion,'' he said.
   Many of the Liberal Democrats' top leaders were ineligible to
succeed Takeshita because they are tainted by the Recruit scandal.
Party power brokers finally turned to Uno after elder statesman
Masayoshi Ito repeatedly refused the job.

   It was like plowing through a whodunit that took
five years to read and finding out there was no last page.
   A $500,000 treasure hunt that drew lovers of mystery and money
ended last week with no payoff _ and no solution.
   No one has been able to decipher the code that leads to a
fortune promised in the story titled ``Treasure: In Search of the
Golden Horse.'' The yarn was released in 1984 as a book, videotape
and laser disc.
   The book and film project was developed on the heels of such
best sellers as ``Masquerade,'' which offered prizes to readers who
solved the mystery.
   Readers and viewers of ``Treasure'' had until midnight May 26 to
figure out the clues, go to the site and dig up the treasure, a
small statue of a horse made with a kilogram of pure gold. Inside
the statue is a key to a safe deposit box containing an annuity
that will pay $25,000 a year for 20 years.
   According to the book, the trove is hidden in a public place
accessible round-the-clock somewhere in the United States.
   Because nobody has found it, that's that, declared Thomas
Conlon, one of three people who knows the solution.
   Conlon, president of D.L. Blair, a sales promotion company that
conducts contests for large corporations, acknowledged Thursday
that his offices have been besieged by callers who had tried for
years to figure out where the golden horse was stashed. But he said:
   ``There was no promise, no suggestion, in the sponsor's
advertising or in the products that the sponsor produced that said
non-winners would ever get the solution. The only thing we can do
is follow the rules exactly to the letter.''
   In most national contests, names of winners are announced but
not their submissions, according to professionals in the field.
   With ``Treasure,'' the rules said the prize, if unfound, goes to
a charity and all the public is entitled to know is which charity.
   The charity is Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America.
   David Davison, assistant executive director of the
Philadelphia-based youth service organization, said an official of
the charity would dig up the golden horse this summer.
   Besides physically unearthing the horse, the charity official
must agree never to reveal where it had been buried, Conlon said.
   The other people who know the secret are Sheldon Renan, a Los
Angeles-based writer who developed the project and wrote the story
of the treasure hunt, and Paul Hoffman, who constructed the codes
and clues. Hoffman is a magazine editor in New York and writes a
brain-teaser column under the name Dr. Crypton.
   Renan said he is bound by the rules against disclosure. Hoffman
did not return calls for comment.
   Intravision, the company formed to promote ``Treasure,'' does
not know the solution of the codes and clues. Its new head, Todd
DeMann, said he wished Conlon would reveal it.
   ``We've been getting tons of grief about it,'' said DeMann.
``I've been speaking to treasure hunters for two years. I'm
frustrated and disappointed that nobody found it. I'm also
disappointed that we're not going to get the location. I think
that's very unfair.''
   DeMann said he had no figures on how many people bought tapes of
``Treasure,'' which, in addition to selling at $59.95 a copy, was
shown on cable television.
   Warner Books, producer of the print version, ran off 147,000
copies to sell at $12.95.
   The codes and clues are contained within a story about a girl's
search for the stolen statue of a horse that her father made for
her.
   One disappointed amateur sleuth, Joann Smith of Northridge,
Calif., said she has been trying to find the treasure for five
years.
   ``My son, who was in eighth grade, got me involved,'' Mrs. Smith
said. ``He's graduating from high school next week. It's been a
long time and I would just like to know the solution.''

<HEAD>Country Hospital Posts $5,000 Reward to Round Up a Doc</HEAD>

   A hospital in Parkers Prairie has tacked up
posters resembling Old West wanted signs around the state offering
a $5,000 reward to anyone who can round up a family practitioner.
   Half the $5,000 bounty will be paid when a doctor signs a
contract. The rest will be paid when the doctor completes a year of
work.
   ``These are drastic times for hospitals and I feel I have to
take drastic measures,'' said administrator James Talley, who is
searching for a second family practitioner for the 21-bed hospital
in the town of about 1,000 people 175 miles northwest of
Minneapolis.
   ``If he finds me two physicians, I could double that,'' Talley
said.
   ``Even $10,000 is cheap when you consider going through a
professional placement agency. They'll charge you $30,000 to
$40,000 easy,'' he said.
   Talley hasn't heard from any doctors since posting the reward
offers a week ago at hospitals, banks and stores in the Twin Cities
and elsewhere in central Minnesota. He's also arranged to have the
Midwest Telephone Co. mail posters to 4,000 customers with their
monthly bills.
   ``It's got a picture of a doctor examining a patient. Above that
it says `reward' just like a wanted poster that you saw years ago
with the cowboys,'' said Talley, who ripped the poster edges ``like
they're burnt around the sides'' to give them an Old West look.
   Rural Minnesota is faced by a general shortage of doctors
created by the fact that country doctors are on call more often,
more physicians are becoming specialists and there are fewer
medical school graduates, said Talley, secretary of the Rural
Health Alliance, an organization of eight country hospitals.
   Parkers Prairie District Hospital had three family practitioners
until recently, Talley said. After 14 years, the first doctor left
in 1987 to work in a larger clinic. The second moved to a bigger
town after serving in a rural area for five years to have his
student loan forgiven.
   The remaining family practitioner has been at Parkers Prairie
more than 20 years and has a couple of hobby farms in the area,
Talley said.
   ``His ties to the community are quite strong. If I could find
some other doctor like that, it would be a great thing. It's
beautiful country,'' he said.
   On the back side, the wanted posters emphasize the area's many
lakes, water sports and location within 10 miles of two state parks.
   While three family practitioners would have to be on call more
often than urban doctors _ every third day compared with every
eighth or 10th day _ the hospital would guarantee them Twin Cities
wages, Talley said. Starting pay would be $50,000 to $75,000
annually, and the hospital is offering a rented home at $250 a
month for the first year.

   For a Soviet system that has stressed order and
control above all else, the inaugural meeting of its new Congress
has been a lesson in the untidiness of democracy. And the people
love it.
   In a week of nationally broadcast sessions that have captivated
Soviets, the 2,250 members of the Congress of People's Deputies
have been learning by trial and error that basic rules of procedure
_ and basic tools such as microphones _ can be as important as
debate itself.
   ``We were the first country in the world to send a man to space,
and our president is counting the votes in the hall with his
fingers,'' complained one deputy, Moldavian writer Ion Drutse.
   Gone are the strict order and decorum that marked previous
incarnations of the Soviet parliament over 70 years of Communist
rule. However dull those sessions were, the agenda was clear and
the speakers had a clear purpose _ to sop up to the leadership.
   Some deputies are impatient with the new disorder, and one said
Monday the session was marred by ``a lot of messing around'' about
procedural matters, such as how long speakers should be given the
floor.
   Another said that with the people's hopes raised the meeting
would begin to solve some of the country's most pressing problems,
it had become ``a Congress of unused opportunities.'' The deputy,
Oleg V. Chernyshev, said some deputies had suffered ``intoxication
with the air within the Kremlin walls.''
   Not even the length of the session is known. It was originally
scheduled to end Wednesday but could last at least a week longer.
   More than 500 deputies have signed up to speak, and the list
keeps growing. So far, only about half have taken the floor.
   The agenda of the Congress also was never clearly spelled out.
In the first four days, the deputies elected a president, Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, heard his report on the state of the union, chose a
vice president, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, and a smaller law-making body.
   But aside from a speech expected by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov,
the remaining agenda is unclear, so the debate has wandered from
the sad state of Soviet libraries to sharp criticism of members of
the ruling Politburo, including Gorbachev.
   At times, deputies pop up from their seats to shout at speakers
or presiding officers. Some demand to speak from the stage; others
prefer just to stand and shout. Only a couple of microphones were
set up on the huge floor for deputies to raise points of order.
They were installed late and are only used ocassionally.
   ``Why did we put up microphones? To decorate the room?'' deputy
Alexei Yastrebov asked sarcastically.
   Some presiding officers have lost their tempers.
   ``You sit down!'' the chairman of Thursday's session, Ukrainian
Boris Y. Paton, shouted to one deputy who walked onto the stage
uninvited.
   Gorbachev intervened on several occasions to calm the hall.
   Long delays and confusion have marred voting, and several
deputies have complained their legislative proposals were not being
distributed to the Congress.
   Electronic voting equipment was never needed for previous
incarnations of the Soviet parliament, because votes were almost
always unanimous. But substantial opposition has surfaced in the
new Congress.
   Drutse, in a speech Thursday, charged that party leaders
intentionally did not have voting equipment installed.
   ``This has happened because the apparatus wants to control the
voting,'' he declared.
   Lukyanov was also criticized for not having prepared rules of
procedure for the Congress in advance. He said this was not done
because presiding officers thought it more democratic if the
deputies themselves set procedure.
   But even when procedures are set, they are often violated. After
much wrangling intitially, the Congress decided to allow each
speaker 15 minutes.
   Gorbachev complained on Wednesday, ``No sooner had this rule
been set than it was broken.''

   Parents accused of forcing their baby
to drink acid seemed like average people, but apparently had
devised a scheme to collect money in a bogus product tampering
case, an investigator said.
   ``I've never seen a case that is as heinous or violent. It's
beyond imagination,'' said Detective Johnie Phelps Jr.
   Shelia Smith, 26, and Ricky Irby Sr., 27, have been charged with
murder in the death of Quinten Irby, who was 3 months old in 1984
when he was taken to a hospital with acid burns in his mouth and
throat.
   Associate Judge Harry Hartel Thursday ordered the parents held
in lieu of $1 million bond each. They are to be arraigned
Wedenesday.
   Phelps, a 14-year veteran of the North Chicago Police
Department, investigated the case and knew Smith and Irby casually
because they lived in the same neighborhood as Phelps' father.
   ``They were just two average people, well known in the
neighborhood, with good reputations,'' said Phelps. ``Ricky always
seemed to be a nice guy _ real personable.''
   Neither had been in trouble with the law, he said, until a Lake
County grand jury indicted them on murder charges Wednesday.
   The parents said Quinten had ingested tainted baby formula, and
he lingered near death for more than two years, unable to eat,
drink, speak or breathe on his own.
   The baby died Aug. 26, 1986.
   Irby filed a lawsuit in August 1987, charging negligence against
the baby formula maker, Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, and
the grocery store where he said the formula was bought.
   Irby withdrew the lawsuit a year ago.
   Phelps said money probably was the motive for the poisoning.
   Both parents were unemployed. They never married and lived in
separate homes a few blocks apart in a neat, blue-collar
neighborhood in this community of 47,000 on Lake Michigan.
   Ms. Smith lived with her mother and the couple's 8-year-old son,
Ricky Jr. Irby lived with his parents.
   After Quinten was taken to the hospital May 31, 1984, tests
revealed that an open can of baby formula contained a large amount
of acid, while an unopened can was uncontaminated, said Irby.
   Prosecutors filed a petition alleging that Quinten was an abused
child, said assistant state's attorney Matthew Chancey, but backed
off when much of the evidence _ cans of formula, a baby bottle and
nipple _ were lost by the Illinois Department of Public Health.
   A break came last November when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in
an Arizona case that evidence lost accidently does not bar
prosecution.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped sharply
today, while the U.S. dollar also declined against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,667.42, falling
313.93 points or 0.92 percent.
   The dollar finished trading at 141.80 yen, 0.72 yen below
Thursday finish. It opened at 142.12 yen and ranged from 141.32 to
142.15 yen during the day.
   ``Market players were adjusting their positions before the U.S.
announces its jobless rate,'' said a foreign exchange dealer at the
Bank of Tokyo on condition of anonymity.
   The United States is to announce the nation's unemployment rate
for May later today in Washington.
   A strong trend toward buying Swiss francs that began earlier
this week also is pulling buyers away from the yen, the dealer said.
   The Swiss National Bank has said it will introduce a floating
rate system, which investors see as favorable to the Swiss currency.
   The dealer said the yen will remain weak until the confusion
plaguing Japanese politics settles down.
   A major bribery scandal, which resulted in the resignation of
Noboru Takeshita as prime minister, has created an air of political
uncertainty for months.
   The dealer said he did not expect today's official selection of
former Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno as Japan's new prime minister
to have much effect on the market.
   However, uncertainty about Uno and how he will deal with the
scandal was keeping some buyers away from the yen.
   ``People do not know Uno abroad.'' the dealer said.
   In the stock market, political concerns also discouraged
investors, said Noboru Ohsuga, chief portfolio manager for Daiwa
Investment Trust and Management Co.
   In a gradual retreat, the market has closed lower in five of the
last six trading days due to profit-taking and a shift by investors
away from domestic demand-related issues and toward high-tech
shares.

   A student whose extraordinary memory has
enabled him to memorize 35,000 digits of an equation _ and pick up
a few bar bets along the way _ is the subject of a $157,000 federal
study, a newspaper reported today.
   Srinivasan Mahadevan, a graduate student from India at Kansas
State University in Manhattan, is trying to become the fourth
person to remember the first 100,000 digits to pi, the
theoretically infinite computation that measures the ratio of the
circumference of a circle to its diameter. He has already memorized
the first 35,000 digits of pi.
   Only three cases of such ability to remember have been
documented in 200 years. One of those people became insane when he
became unable to forget anything and his reasoning processes
drowned in a flood of facts.
   To find out what makes Mahadevan tick, the federal government
has awarded a $157,000 grant to Kansas State, The Wichita
Eagle-Beacon reported.
   The answer may shed light on how other people remember things.
   ``We're hoping to find insights into the average intelligence,
too,'' said Rod Vogl, a graduate assistant in charge of
administering tests.
   Four students with average memories also are being studied as a
control group, and so far they haven't fared well against
Mahadevan. A test involves flashing one number on a screen per
second _ or speaking one number per second _ and seeing how many
the students can remember. The average score is seven or eight and
anything above 10 is considered exceptional. Mahadevan typically
tallies about 38 if he sees the numbers, about 50 if hears them.
   Of course, that's under clinical conditions. Vogl says Mahadevan
usually scores much better _ as many as 105 _ in the friendlier
atmosphere of the Manhattan watering holes where he has been known
to win some astounding bar bets.
   The 30-year-old native of Mangalore, India, thinks heredity and
his childhood environment both played significant roles.
   ``It runs in the family,'' he said. ``My father knows all 37
plays and 150 sonnets of William Shakespeare by heart, so I think
there is a genetic basis for it.''

   A simulated nuclear blast
destroyed scaled-down versions of bridges, homes and a forest in a
test to show what happens to military and civilian equipment during
and after a large explosion.
   The pine trees, model bridges and and structures were among
hundreds of items placed at various distances from ground zero
where 2,440 tons of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil were detonated
Thursday.
   It will take months for scientists to evaluate the results, said
Navy Cmdr. J.R. Lund of the Defense Nuclear Agency's Test
Directorate.
   The agency sponsored the test, called Miser's Gold and designed
to determine the effects of air blast and ground shock on such
things as bunkers, underground shelters and radar. It was the fifth
in a series of non-nuclear explosions the agency has set off since
1976.
   Seven of about 180 test trees remained after the explosion. The
walls of the buildings facing the blast site looked as though a
giant fist had torn through them.
   One of two small model bridges collapsed; the other was severely
damaged.
   ``No one is going to be driving over that bridge,'' Lund told
reporters during a drive through the 120-acre test bed about two
hours after the blast.
   Some of the military equipment used in the blast included a
helicopter, tanks, parts of Navy ships and some foreign vehicles.
   The equipment, including three Soviet military vehicles, was
covered immediately after the blast to hide the damage.
   Lund said it would be possible for other countries to fly
overhead and photograph the damage.
   ``We don't want other people to know how much damage it caused
to our equipment or theirs,'' he said.
   Thursday's blast had a simulated equivalent of a 4-kiloton
nuclear bomb. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, had a force of
13 kilotons.
   Lt. Col. David Barber, who helped design the test bed, said the
fallout from the explosion sounded like rain on the tin roof of the
George McDonald ranch house. Barber watched the explosion from the
house two miles from ground zero.
   ``It knocked one guy's hat off (in the house),'' said Barber,
his own hat speckled with dust pellets from the fallout.
   Lund said the cost of the experiment was $7.6 million to $7.8
million.

   A Vatican postage stamp issued to
commemorate Pope John Paul II's trip to Scandinavia contains a
mistake in Latin, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   The Latin writing on the stamp was supposed to say ``John Paul
the Second Visits Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden,''
but instead of the Latin word for Sweden _ Svetiam _ the stamp has
``Svebiam,'' the agency reported Thursday.
   Svebiam means Swabia, a region in southwest West Germany.
   The Rev. Carlo Eger, director of the Vatican Latin foundation's
magazine, Lattinitas, told ANSA the mistake ``is a huge error that
should have been avoided.
   ``Latin, unfortunately, is on decline even in the Vatican,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   Latin remains the Vatican's official language but its use at
Mass was made optional after the Second Vatican Council.

   Three Michigan trade schools may not
survive a federal report listing them as having the nation's worst
student-loan default rates, according to school officials.
   ``This could put us out of business,'' said Joseph Belliotti
Jr., vice president of the Saywer School of Business in this
middle-income Detroit suburb. He said a U.S. Education Department
report stating that 93.8 percent of Sawyer students who were due to
start repaying loans in 1986 failed to do so was inaccurate.
   Officials at other trade schools with high percentages of
delinquent borrowers said federal penalties could discourage
schools from serving low-income students.
   ``We're the schools of last resort. These people have been shut
out of the entire school system,'' said Ted Jakub, president of the
Cambridge Business College of Detroit, which had a loan-default
rate of 86 percent. ``They can't go to the community colleges. The
only place they've got to go is a school that will show interest in
them.''
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos announced Thursday that
schools with extremely high percentages of delinquent borrowers
will face an escalating series of corrective and punitive actions.
   Under the new federal guidelines, schools with default rates
above 60 percent could be barred from the government's student loan
program starting Jan. 1, 1991, and schools with 40 percent to 60
percent of their students failing to pay back loans must reduce the
figure by 5 percent a year or face the same penalties.
   The four schools with the highest default rates were from
Michigan.
   Officials at Sawyer expressed shock at having the nation's
highest student loan-default rate, since the federal figure was
more than twice the rate reported by the state of Michigan, which
administers the school's guaranteed loan program.
   Based on loans from 1975 through April 30, Sawyer's cumulative
default rate was 38.39 percent, according to George Lamb,
supervisor of claims and collections for the Michigan School Loan
Guarantee Program.
   ``Nobody from the state wants to talk to the feds, and no one
from the feds wants to talk to the state,'' said Sawyer
administrator Mike Shiner, who questioned how the federal figure
was calculated.
   The school trains about 300 students in office skills. A
six-month secretarial course costs $3,900.
   Officials at other trade schools with high default rates said
the income levels of the students they serve should be taken into
consideration.
   ``We have quite a few low-income, less advantaged students
through here,'' said Jessica Murray, co-owner of the Kalamazoo
Beauty Academy in Kalamazoo, which had the second-highest default
rate nationally, 89.5 percent. ``I think that always should put
some credence into the fact that our default rate is going to be
higher.''
   She added, ``We have no recourse to collect loans, nor to
enforce payment. I think we've become a little bit of a scapegoat.''
   At the Cambridge Business College of Detroit, ``We deal strictly
with the inner-city minorities,'' Jakub said.
   ``Some of our students go to work after graduation. Some do not
go to work because of the welfare system,'' he said. ``They find
the welfare benefits equal to what they earn out there.''
   Federal sanctions could force the Cambridge school, which has
about 200 students, out of business, Jakub said.
   The fourth Michigan school on the federal list, the
Payne-Pulliam School of Trade in Detroit, had a default rate of
85.5 percent.

   Dustin Hoffman heard cheers for his British stage
debut as Shylock in Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   But while he won approval from the opening-night audience in
London's Phoenix Theater, the critics today gave him mixed reviews.
   ``In side curls and skullcap, Hoffman gave Shylock humor, a
passion for revenge and a tortured dignity when he loses all. It
was a far cry from Raymond Babbitt, the autistic savant he plays in
his current hit film `Rain Man','' wrote Reg Evans of the British
domestic news agency Press Association.
   In The Times of London, Irving Wardle was less enthusiastic. He
wrote, ``All the clamorous hype and slavering expectation is a poor
preparation for the modest Shylock who arrived on the Phoenix stage
last night...''
   Lester Middlehurst, in the tabloid Today, found Hoffman's
Shylock ``fascinating.''
   The production by Sir Peter Hall also starred British actress
Geraldine James as Portia.
   When Hoffman heard that Hall was forming his own company, he
asked for a role. They decided on Shylock, a part Hall said at the
time was ``for a great Jewish actor who can use his Jewishness in
the play.''
   Hoffman, 51, won an Oscar early this year for his role in ``Rain
Man.'' He also has starred in ``The Graduate,'' ``Midnight Cowboy''
and ``Tootsie.''
   He will play Shylock for three months.

   Graham, divorced father of a 13-year-old girl, sounded a bit
more cautious. ``I'm more careful the second time around. We care
very much for each other. I'm her man and she's my woman and we
won't be pressured by the public,'' he said.
   Ms. Winfrey, who earns $1.5 million a month, lives in a luxury
condo in Chicago and has a 160-acre farm in Indiana for getting
away from it all.
   ``I am delighted with myself,'' she said.

   ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson can't

senator, is ``scum'' who makes millions off the sex and violence

Fortune'' as trash.
   ``Miami Vice'' ran for five years on NBC and its last show, a

   ``I know Don Johnson, and he is scum,'' Rockefeller told an

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson's
split decision with actress Robin Givens has become official. They
are no longer husband and wife.
   Tyson, 22, who married Ms. Givens on Feb. 12, 1988, flew to the
Dominican Republic on Valentine's Day, where he signed divorce
papers. Ms. Givens signed them at a later date.
   That divorce, however, was not recognized in New Jersey, where
the couple resided during their marriage.
   After a hearing Thursday in Superior Court, the two signed
divorce papers. Tyson attended the hearing, but the 24-year-old
star of ABC-TV's ``Head of the Class'' did not.
   ``Robin just didn't choose to come today because she's divorced
already,'' said her attorney Raoul Felder.
   Attorneys for both parties said Tyson would retain ownership of
their $4 million Bernardsville mansion and that Ms. Givens would
keep jewelry that was given to her, several automobiles and an
undisclosed amount of cash.

<TEXT>
   The Recruit Co. is the parent of a group of
publishing, finance, and real estate companies whose former
chairman is accused of bribing legislators and government officials
to get favors for his firms.
   Five Recruit executives, including its founder and former
chairman Hiromasa Ezoe, have been arrested on charges of bribery
and securities law violations.
   Ezoe, 52, started an employment information magazine in 1962,
eventually branched out into real estate and finance, and built a
large conglomerate considered one of Japan's most innovative in the
fast-growing services sector.
   In Japan, where companies compete fiercely to attract top-grade
employees and where job mobility is increasing, specialized
employment information is big business. Shiny highrises with large
Recruit logos dot Tokyo's expensive business districts, and a
variety of Recruit magazines can be found on almost any newsstand.
   In order to influence legislation and get other favors,
prosecutors say, Ezoe sold millions of dollars worth of stock in
the Recruit-Cosmos real estate company at bargain prices to 13
legislators from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, four
opposition lawmakers, and about 140 influential businessmen and
government officials. Purchasers of the stock reaped large profits
when share prices shot up when first publicly listed in 1986.
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone admitted receiving 45
million yen ($320,000) from Recruit; Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, replaced today by Sousuke Uno, admitted receiving 151
million yen ($1.4 million) in stocks and donations from Recruit
through an aide.
   After the scandal broke last summer, Hiroshi Matsubara, a top
aide to Ezoe, was arrested and received a suspended sentence of 18
months after a video camera captured him attempting to bribe an
opposition lawmaker to soften investigation of the scandal.
   Despite the scandal, the company has continued to do well. Sales
at the Recruit Co. jumped 46 percent to 269 billion yen ($2.1
billion) last year, according to figures released by the company.
   Profits jumped nearly 24 percent to 37.77 billion yen ($290
million) last year, ranking it near the top 100 Japanese companies,
according to Tokyo Shoko Research Co., a private credit research
firm.
   Recruit Co. is privately held and does not reveal profit figures.
   Profits at First Finance Co., another Recruit group company,
jumped nearly 10 times to 17.06 billion yen ($131 million), the
report said.
   However, the scandal may hurt future prospects for the company,
said Toshihiko Yamazaki of Tokyo Shoko Research.

   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho returned
to his home district insisting nothing is hanging over him besides
his already revealed purchase of $100,000 in junk bonds that led to
his resignation.
   ``Some say this is not the type of mistake to do what you are
doing,'' Coelho told reporters late Thursday on his first visit to
the district since his startling resignation announcement.
   ``There is no other issue involved,'' he said. ``It's just that
I set a high standard. I made a mistake. I'm willing to live with
it, and it's time to move on.''
   Pressed again about whether any other undisclosed financial
dealings could prove embarrassing, he responded:
   ``I just answered that and don't care to answer it again.''
   He said he decided to quit Congress for fear he would be
ineffective because questions about his financial deals would
overshadow his work.
   ``I felt for the next two years, I would be answering no
questions except my personal finances, and my ability to represent
would not be there,'' Coelho said. ``Everybody is replaceable,
myself included.''
   Coelho's announcement last week that he will resign from
Congress on June 15, his 47th birthday, surprised many observers
who felt he had not been that severely damaged from disclosures
about his investment in a $100,000 junk bond for which he put up no
money of his own.
   Still, Coelho said he didn't want to put his family or the
Democratic party through a protracted controversy over his finances.
   During Thursday's news conference, Coelho said: ``If you are a
hard-driving, partisan politician, and you like to make a
difference, if you make a mistake as I admitted I did, it is
difficult to do what you want done.''
   He contended that his junk bond purchase was legal, and news
reports that he is subject to a criminal investigation for owing
back taxes are false.
   Even though allegations are untrue, ``you can't take them back
once they are printed,'' Coelho said.
   With his wife, Phyllis, and two teen-age daughters at his side,
Coelho said he wears a Mickey Mouse watch ``to remind myself never
to take myself personally that seriously. During the last 10 years,
I always thought personal power was not that important. Power is
important to get things done.''
   Coelho, whose youthful hope of becoming a priest was stopped
when he learned he had epilepsy, said he has no regrets about
leaving Congress.
   ``I have tremendous inner peace,'' he said.

   Four convicted murderers were
hanged today, including the first woman to be executed in South
Africa since 1986.
   Sandra Smith, a 24-year-old mother of three, was hanged at
Pretoria Central Prison along with a co-accused, Yassiem Harris,
21, for the stabbing death of a 16-year-old girl during a 1986
burglary in Cape Town.
   Also hanged was Michael Erasmus, convicted of suffocating a
fellow prisoner in a police cell in 1987, and Jacob Ndada, 28,
convicted of killing five blacks with a stolen pistol during a
weeklong rape and robbery spree in 1987.
   Ndada was black, while Smith, Harris and Erasmus were of
mixed-race.
   So far this year, 28 people have been hanged in South Africa,
including two whites, 22 blacks and four people of mixed-race.
   The rate of executions is down sharply from last year, when 117
people were hanged, or 1987, when a record 164 people were executed.
   The Justice Department said 37 Death Row prisoners have been
granted reprieves so far this year. About 200 prisoners remain on
Death Row.

<TEXT>
   Failure to take medication is the leading cause
of organ rejection among kidney transplant patients three months
beyond surgery, a study shows, and that's a particularly bitter
pill for doctors.
   ``It's obviously very important in transplanting because the
consequences can be fatal, and it's wasted money and effort,'' said
Dr. Robert Schweizer, professor of surgery at the University of
Connecticut.
   Non-compliance appears to be highest among patients younger than
20, blacks, Hispanics, and low-income individuals regardless of
race, said Schweizer, who conducted the study.
   ``Any transplant surgeon with 20 years' experience has cases
that break your heart,'' said Dr. Paul Peters, chairman of surgery
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.
   Schweizer said in a report being presented today before the
American Society of Transplant Surgeons that failure to take
medication was noted among 47 of 260 patients, or 18 percent, who
received kidneys at Hartford Hospital from 1971 to 1984.
   Patients who suffered organ rejection or died within three
months of surgery were excluded from the study.
   An average of four years passed before the errant patients
stopped taking their medication and exhibited organ rejection,
Schweizer said. Transplant patients must take drugs every day of
their lives to keep their bodies' natural immune sytem from
rejecting the organ.
   A subsequent study conducted from 1984 to 1987 found 30 of 196
kidney recipients, or 15 percent, failed to take their medication,
Schweizer said. An average of two years passed before organ
rejection was noted.
   Eighty-two kidney recipients were evaluated from 1987 to 1988,
following staff efforts to boost compliance. Only two refused to
take their medication, or 2.4 percent, Schweizer said.
   Liver and heart recipients were included in the third study.
   Three of the 13 liver patients were repeatedly non-compliant,
two of whom died, Schweizer said. Three of the 50 heart recipients
did not take their medication, one of whom died. The other two
showed evidence of rejection.
   Reasons for not taking medication included, psychiatric
disorders, alcoholism, concern over appearances and a feeling of
invincibility, Schweizer said. The ability to buy the medication
was irrelevant since the government covers the cost.
   ``Rehabilitation following an organ transplant is so spectacular
that patients feel so well, it is difficult for them to understand
why they have to keep taking medicine,'' he said.
   ``Just telling them doesn't necessarily get the message
across,'' said Dr. J. Wesley Alexander, president of the American
Society of Transplant Surgeons. ``Sometimes it takes a fairly
dramatic event like the loss of a kidney and going back on
dialysis.''
   When that happens at the University of Cincinnati, where
Alexander works, patients are told they must wait a year or so
before returning to the transplant waiting list.
   ``It seems unfair to other patients to let somebody have a
transplant if they're not going to follow the rules and take their
medication,'' he said. ``It denies somebody else.''
   As of Monday, 14,993 people were awaiting kidney transplants in
the United States, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing.

<HEAD>Food Riots Subside but Currency Continues Falling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The food riots have subsided but
Argentina's currency continues sliding in black-market trading, an
indication the economic crisis that prompted looting in the major
cities is worsening.
   On Thursday, police arrested six leaders of the small leftist
Workers Party on orders from a federal judge who accused the party
of spurring riots in Argentina's four largest cities.
   Fourteen people died, 80 were arrested and more than 2,000
arrested.
   Looters, many of them women and children, have been sacking
stores and eating food on the spot in the nationwide unrest despite
a state of siege the government declared on Monday.
   Provincial officials across Argentina set up soup kitchens,
froze supermarket prices for basic foods and medicine, and
coordinated charity collections of food and clothing.
   The austral, Argentina's currency, continued its free fall
against the dollar, sliding in black-market trading to 230-1, or 24
percent less than the rate of 175-1 set two days ago by the Central
Bank. Foreign exchange houses refused to sell dollars at the
official price.
   The devaluation of the austral, 70 percent monthly inflation and
unemployment has pushed prices of basic commodities beyond the
means of many in this beef- and grain-exporting nation. A budget
deficit and a $59 billion foreign debt have also been cited as
causes for the rioting.
   Government employees in several provinces threatened to strike
for higher pay, bakers in Buenos Aires refused to sell bread at the
official price and stores continued to mark up products.
   The government of President Raul Alfonsin admitted after
lootings began that poverty had widened during the economic crisis
of the past several months. But authorities claim slum dwellers
were encouraged to rise up by agitators, who also attacked police.
   The Workers Party candidate for president in May 14 elections,
Jorge Altamira, said his party did not encourage the looting and
such allegations by the government amount to ``ideological
persecution.''
   ``We were in favor of better salaries, food, returning suspended
and fired workers to their jobs, and ... a general strike,''
Altamira saud,'
   Arrested with Altamira were five other party leaders, including
the party's vice presidential candidate, Gregorio Flores, in the
elections won by Carlos Menem and the Peronist Party. Formal
charges were not immediately disclosed.
   Federal Judge Gerardo Larrambebere of the Buenos Aires suburb of
Moron ordered the arrest of the Workers Party leaders, and the
search and closure of their offices in the metropolitan area.
   Larrambebere said his order was based on ``prima facie evidence
showing that party activists encouraged in large measure'' rioting
in towns under his jurisdiction, including San Miguel, where four
people were killed, and Moreno, where three others died.
   In the capital and the northern city of Rosario, 14 people died
since Monday, the Interior Ministry said Thursday evening in its
first official tally. Preliminary reports from police and hospitals
had put the death toll at 16.
   Before they subsided, Alfonsin had declared a state of siege,
several thousand paramilitary police were sent to Rosario, bombs
exploded in Buenos Aires and a supermarket in the western city of
Mendoza was set ablaze by a firebomb.
   Former President Arturo Frondizi publicly urged Alfonsin to
``resign immediately'' and hand power over to President-elect
Menem, who is due to take office on Dec. 10.
   ``The concern of the immense majority of the Argentine people is
that ... Menem assumes his functions with every possibility of
success,'' and six more months of Alfonsin's ``unfortunate
administration'' stand in the way of that, Frondizi said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has approved a genetically
engineered drug that can help reduce anemia in patients suffering
from kidney failure and may also benefit cancer and AIDS patients.
   The drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration Thursday
is a copy of a natural human protein, erythropoietin, which
stimulates the body to produce red blood cells.
   Lack of those cells, which carry energy-giving oxygen around the
body, is known as anemia. And since the kidneys produce
erythropoietin, patients with kidney failure often develop anemia.
   Food and Drug Commissioner Frank Young said that in addition to
about 95,000 kidney patients who should benefit from the new drug,
it also may be useful to chronically anemic patients suffering from
other diseases, such as cancer and AIDS.

   Robert Fulton has dropped out of consideration
for a top welfare post in the Bush administration after strong
opposition from Senate conservatives and anti-abortion advocates.
   ``I have requested my name be withdrawn, but, of course, I don't
do that with any joy,'' Fulton, Oklahoma's social services
secretary, said Thursday.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, who had
wanted Fulton to head the Family Services Administration which
manages the government's major welfare programs, said he accepted
Fulton's decision with ``profound regret.''
   Fulton was named as a defendant in a 1985 lawsuit alleging that
from 1977 to 1983 several babies born with the severe spinal defect
were denied life-saving surgery at the state hospital. He was
recently dropped as a defendant.
   Fulton, 57, said in Oklahoma City he was ``disturbed about this
type of influence by people who don't mind using smear tactics to
get their objective.''
   ``They misrepresented what has gone on in the spina bifida
controversy in Oklahoma and they were able to scare up alliances
with other groups,'' Fulton said.

   A move that could lead to statehood for Puerto

   A Senate committee on Thursday began considering legislation
that would allow Puerto Rican voters to choose independence,
statehood or more autonomy while remaining a U.S. commonwealth.
   ``The process we begin today is designed to give the people of
Puerto Rico realistic options from which they can choose and expect
that an option will be implemented,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston,

   A bomb blast today damaged the
home of the leader of the Indian chamber of Parliament but police
said there were no injuries.
   Ebrahim Abramjee, chairman of the House of Delegates, was
visiting Britain with his wife, but his three sons and his
80-year-old mother were at the house when the blast occurred
shortly after midnight in Laudium, a township for Indians outside
Pretoria.
   Windows were shattered, and a wall was badly damaged by the
bomb, which police identified as a Soviet-made limpet mine.
   There was no claim of responsibility, and police gave no
indication who might have been responsible.
   Last month, the home of a white Parliament member of the
governing National Party was damaged by a bomb. There were
unconfirmed press reports that white right-wing extremists may have
been responsible.
   Parliament has segregated chambers for whites, Indians and
people of mixed-race, but excludes the black majority. The Indian
and mixed-race legislators are viewed by many anti-apartheid
militants as government collaborators because of their decision to
seek office rather than join an election boycott when the two
non-white chambers were established in 1984.
   Seats in all three chambers will be contested in a general
election Sept. 6.

<HEAD>Oil Ministers Gather for Production, Price Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers gathered today to discuss
whether they should increase oil production in the face of surging
prices that have pushed the cost of a barrel of oil 40 percent
higher since November.
   ``They're keen to keep revenues up,'' said Fergus MacLeod, an
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. ``The underlying mood
is don't rock the boat.''
   The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries were kicking off their talks at an afternoon
meeting of an eight-member committee.
   Their formal strategy sessions will begin Monday when they open
their mid-year ministerial meeting at OPEC headquarters in Vienna.
   The ministers' task is to set pricing and production levels for
the final half of the year.
   Analysts predicted tough bargaining during the discussions.
   ``They will come to an agreement in the end,'' said Pierre
Terzian, editor of the Paris-based oil publication,
Petrostrategies. ``But it will be rather difficult.''
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, confirmed reports
that he intended to suggest scrapping the cartel's benchmark price
of $18 a barrel. He declined to elaborate.
   The Saudis were earlier reported to have wanted to revive a
plan, unveiled briefly late last year, for setting a minimum price
of $15 a barrel.
   The production accord that runs from January to June has set an
output ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day for the producer
nations. Its price target is $18 a barrel.
   The agreement was worked out in November in an effort to curb
OPEC's overproduction and lift crude prices.
   Prices have surged this year, a gain attributed not only to the
cartel's output cuts but also to accidents in oil-producing areas.
The supply of oil has been reduced to the world market, although
analysts have reported a pickup in OPEC output in recent weeks.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
has soared from $12.34 a barrel in November to $17.67 a barrel last
week. It ran up above the cartel's benchmark earlier in the year
but has slipped a bit since then.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, was
trading at $20 a barrel.
   Nick Antill, analyst at the London brokerage County NatWest,
predicted producers would raise their daily output ceiling by a
million or so barrels, up to 19.5 million barrels.
   OPEC reported last week that 12 of its members supplied 17.54
million barrels a day in international markets in April, just above
the supply target of 17.51 million barrels.
   Total production by the dozen was 18.47 million barrels a day in
April, it said.
   Figures for the Unied Arab Emirates were not available.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   Severe thunderstorms brought heavy rain to western Texas and
eastern New Mexico today, while a heat wave continued in parts of
the East and West coasts.
   Scattered thunderstorms also hit the upper Ohio Valley, the
eastern Great Lakes and Upper Michigan.
   A tornado on Thursday blew out windows in homes in the Colorado
City, Texas, area, and a twister was reported near Lamesa, Texas,
where power lines were downed.
   Two inches of rain and baseball-size hail fell in the southwest
Texas town of Alpine. Flooding near Big Spring, Texas, washed cars
off roads after more than an inch of rain fell in 20 minutes.
Thunderstorm winds uprooted trees.
   In New Mexico, tornadoes touched down near Ramon and Yeso;
golfball-size hail covered the ground near Elida.
   Thunderstorms in Illinois on Thursday caused flooding, power
failures and cancellation of sporting events, including a fishing
derby.
   Heavy rains raised the water level in the Chicago River by 3
feet. Metropolitan Water Reclamation District workers had planned
to stock the river with trout, but barges could no longer be moored
because of high water.
   Flooding caused one death in Hobart, Ind., police said.
   Several record temperatures were set Thursday, including
Alameda, Calif., 92 degrees; Baltimore, 99; New York City, 93;
Oakland, 87; and San Francisco, 90.
   The high temperature in the nation Thursday was 104 degrees at
Laredo, Texas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
over much of the Plains states, the upper Mississippi Valley, and
from east Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley, parts of the
Tennessee and Ohio valleys into New England; possibly severe
thunderstorms in parts of the southern Plains into south-central
Kansas; and widely scattered showers and thunderstorms in the
northern and central Rockies, and parts of Florida.
   Predicted highs: 60s along the Canadian border from Montana to
Upper Michigan; 90s from parts of Washington and Oregon across
interior valleys of California, the desert Southwest, the southern
Rockies, most of Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf
Coast states and the Tennessee Valley to the middle and south
Atlantic coastal states; 100 degrees-plus along the Rio Grande

   One of five men indicted on charges of
conspiring to export sensitive underwater surveillance equipment to
the Soviet Union has surrendered.
   Raymond N. Long, 39, who operated an export company to supply
companies with offshore drilling equipment, surrendered Thursday to
federal officials in Baton Rouge. He was released on $20,000 bond.
   A federal grand jury in New York on Wednesday indicted two
Japanese, a Norwegian and a Soviet citizen. They were accused of
attempting to export the $1.3 million of equipment to Norway,
knowing it would be shipped to Japan and then the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets had sought the equipment since learning from
American spy Ronald Pelton in 1980 that the United States was
intercepting Soviet communications passing through underseas
cables, The New York Times reported today.
   The others named in the indictment were Sverre Schlytter
Henrichsen, president of Schlytter Henrichsen, A-S of Oslo, Norway;
Hiderm Yamaguchi, formerly an employee of Shimyo Engineering Co.,
Ltd., in Kobe-Shi, Japan; Magaaki Takahashi, president of Marine
Services Co., Ltd., in Kobe-Shi, Japan; and Ilya Petrovich Butakov,
vice president of the Soviet Shipping Export-Import Corp., also
known as Sudoimport of Moscow.
   The extradition of the other men was being reviewed by the
Justice and State departments, officials said. If convicted on all
counts, the five men each face up to 55 years in prison and fines
of $200,000.
   Long allegedly ordered a $500,000 underwater sonar surveillance
and mapping system to send to Norway.
   ``Mr. Long is charged with a scheme in which he helped to
falsify documents to make it appear that the goods were being
shipped to Norway, when he knew that the equipment would ultimately
be sent to the Soviet Union,'' said J. Robert Grimes, Regional
Customs Commissioner in New Orleans.
   ``One of the underwater cameras was shipped and did reach the
Soviet Union; however, that was not the most sensitive part. The
most sensitive part of the system was detained in Japan,'' he said.
   Officials said that exporting the system to friendly countries
for legitimate drilling purposes was permitted, but it could also
be used for locating and identifying underwater targets, such as
mines, torpedoes and communication cables.
   For national security reasons, the system was barred from export
to the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, FBI agent Bill
Massengale said from Gulfport, Miss.
   Long and Henrichsen hatched the scheme, Massengale said.
   Long falsified documents to get an export license and shipped
the system to Henrichsen in 1984, according to court papers.
Henrichsen then resold the system to Yamaguchi and Hagaaki. The
Japanese businessmen allegedly agreed to sell the system for $1.3
million to Butakov.

   The U.S. dollar eased in calm trading this morning
in what dealers described as a readjustment rather than a change in
a long-term trend.
   Gold profited from the dollar's slight decline.
   ``There's a bit of indecision in the market right now as the
dollar tries to find a new bottom,'' said a trader in Milan, Italy.
``But people are only waiting for the new low so they can start to
buy again.''
   Another trader said that a ``nervous'' market on Thursday had
been followed by a ``lazy'' market today.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 141.80 yen, down from 142.52 on
Thursday. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 141.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.9715 West German marks, down from 1.9835
   _1.6920 Swiss francs, down from 1.7040
   _6.6900 French francs, down from 6.7185

   _1,432.00 Italian lire, from 1,442.50
   _1.2026 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2068.
   In London, it cost $1.5835 to buy one pound, compared to $1.5730
on Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at $362.50 a troy ounce, unchanged from
late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $362.70.
   In Zurich, the bid was $362.50 compared with $361.85 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $362.60.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.22 a troy ounce, unchanged

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today called on Roman
Catholics and Protestants in Europe to fight the forces of
materialism that he said threatened individualism and their
freedoms.
   On the second day of a five-nation tour of Scandinavia, a
stronghold of Lutheranism, John Paul traveled north to this fjord
city of 135,000 people where less than 1 percent of the residents
are Catholics.
   At an ecumenical prayer service in a cathedral that was the
center of Catholicism in pre-reformation Scandinavia, John Paul
emphasized the common roots of Catholics and Lutherans.
   ``As Christians we proclaim a wisdom that recognizes and upholds
the priority of ethics over technology, the primacy of the person
over things, the superiority of spirit over matter,'' the Roman
Catholic leader said.
   ``Before us lies the duty of opening a new Christian chapter in
history in response to the many challenges of a changing world.
   ``Christians understand what is at stake. The history of our own
century clearly shows that where no transcendent norm is
acknowleged, people are in danger of surrendering themselves to
forces which take command of society without concern for
individuals and their freedoms.''
   The papal tour of Scandinavia opened Thursday with a frank
exchange between the pope and Norway's top Lutheran bishop, who
urged the Roman Catholic leader to view Scandinavia's dominant
religion as an equal.
   The five-country, 10-day tour is the first ever by a pope to
this region, where the Protestant Reformation vanquished
Catholicism four centuries ago.
   The meeting between John Paul and Bishop Andreas Aarflot of Oslo
followed a reception by sparse crowds in this country of only
27,800 Roman Catholics.
   John Paul was scheduled to travel later in the day to Tromsoe,
more than 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle for a late prayer
service.
   Aarflot and the pope exchanged speeches in English and applauded
each other's remarks in an hourlong meeting in a hall richly
decorated with tapestries and portraits of Norwegian royalty.
   In his speech, Aarflot said there were many signs that the Roman
Catholic Church is breaking away ``from what many observers and
historians would call its isolation and self-sufficiency through
the centuries.''
   But he said much more needs to be done as far as Lutherans were
concerned. In his response, John Paul pledged that the quest for
unity was an ``irrevocable part of the Catholic Church's life.''
   But, he added, ``Catholics and Protestants must acknowledge that
we cannot yet proclaim a common faith in the mystery of the
eucharist and of the church.
   ``The Catholic position on eucharistic sharing is not meant to
offend our partners in dialogue,'' he said, adding that ``the
eucharist is only to be shared by those in full communion with one
another.''
   With only 200,000 Catholics in the five countries, or less than
1 percent of the population, John Paul was not expected to draw
sizeable crowds as he has been used to during many of his 42
foreign trips in his 10{-year papacy.
   Scandinavian attitudes also contrast with Rome on issues such as
abortion, contraception and divorce, all prohibited by church
teaching.
   A leading Oslo newspaper, the tabloid Dagbladet, published a
caricature Thursday depicting the pope's miter in the shape of a
condom.
   Norway's prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, said she
discussed the problem of fighting AIDS among other issues in talks
Thursday. The Vatican is opposed to the use of condoms to protect
against the spread of the disease and views the issue mainly as a
problem of sexual morality.

   Hordes of mosquitoes out for blood have descended
on New England this spring, zapping beaches and family barbecues
and sending residents running for shelter.
   ``These mosquitoes are especially aggressive,'' Herbert
Maxfield, field director for the Massachusetts Center for Disease
Control, said Thursday. ``They come at you with full intent of
getting your blood.''
   Arthur Doty, chairman of the Mosquito Control District for the
Vermont towns of Brandon, Leicester and Salisbury, said mosquitoes
were plaguing the region in greater numbers than he'd seen in 30
years.
   ``We've got an epidemic,'' he said.
   Stung by the attack, citizens in one Vermont town rallied for a
remedy, calling on state lawmakers to pay for mosquito control.
   The onslaught is probably the result of heavier-than-normal
rainfall in April and May, Maxfield said. ``It may have brought
about the hatching of the eggs and now those adults are on the
wing,'' he said.
   ``I'd say for this time of year it's as bad as it's been in
recent memory,'' said David Struble, an entomologist with Maine's
Department of Conservation and Disease Management.
   University of Vermont entomologist Gordon Nielsen said spring's
sudden eruption this year also was to blame for the buzzing hordes.
   ``Temperatures went to 90 and it just had a telescoping
effect,'' he said. The heat stimulated the simultaneous emergence
of dozens of different species of biting insects that usually
appear in sequence, he said.
   The situation in Vermont's southern Addision and northern
Rutland counties is so severe that 150 demonstrators gathered
Wednesday in Brandon to protest the Legislature's failure to fund
mosquito control.
   Residents said the biting insects constitute a disaster, and one
speaker suggested summoning the National Guard.
   The towns of Brandon, Leicester and Salisbury _ bordered on the
west by 20,000 acres of swamp _ want the state Legislature to fund
a $200,000 study and larvae control program.
   Graham Walden, who attended the demonstration, said state
officials must realize ``this is not a joke. This is a very serious
economic problem.
   ``Some people have used the phrase `a prisoner in your own
home,' because all of the things one normally enjoys at this time
of year are a nightmare to complete,'' Walden said, who covers
himself with insect repellent three times a day when he walks his
dog.
   In Connecticut, the state Department of Health Services' chief
mosquito fighter surveyed sections of the state's coastline.
   Paul Capotosto said in one ``landing bite test,'' a person stood
in a wooded spot for five minutes and received more than five bites.
   And there's more bad news.
   Theodore Andreadis, an entomologist at the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, said just as the
current crop of mosquitoes begins to die off in two months, another
round of larvae is likely to hatch given sufficient rainfall in
June and July.
   ``The outlook is fairly grim,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bakkers Receive $1.2 Million Tax Bill From IRS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Jim Bakker says he has always
paid his taxes, but the federal government contends otherwise.
   Bakker and his wife, Tammy, received a $1.2 million tax bill
Thursday from the Internal Revenue Service. The lien ordered the
Bakkers to pay $666,000 for 1981 and $565,000 for 1982 in taxes,
interest and penalties, The Orlando Sentinel reported in today's
editions.
   ``I don't owe taxes,'' Bakker said when shown a copy of the
lien. ``I've always paid my taxes. It's a part of the plot to
destroy Jim and Tammy.''
   The tax lien is only the latest in a series of setbacks for the
televangelists, who recently moved to Orlando.
   Bakker is to stand trial in August on charges of fraud in
connection with his former Praise the Lord ministry. Bakker, his
wife and an aide also have been ordered to pay $7.6 million to PTL
as part of a judgment in a suit that accused them of misusing
ministry funds.
   The lien, filed in Orange County, prevents the Bakkers from
selling any property without IRS permission, said Jackie Bracey, an
IRS public affairs officer in Greensboro, N.C.
   The Bakkers have been taping their ``Jim and Tammy'' show at an
Orlando shopping center since May 8. They are leasing space at the
center and renting a home in an exclusive subdivision.
   During a taping Wednesday, Bakker told his audience he and his
wife were about $200,000 behind in paying off bills related to the
show.
   IRS officials said the lien was related only to the Bakkers'
individual income for the two years. However, Tammy Bakker
contended the IRS is somehow trying to charge the Bakkers for other
expenses.
   ``They're charging us for PTL store fixtures,'' she said,
referring to the North Carolina ministry they were pressed to leave
in 1987 amid sex and financial scandals.
   In Columbia, S.C., U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop
entertained a claim that his predecessor, Judge Rufus Reynolds, was
biased in ordering the $6.6 million judgment against the Bakkers
and their top aide.
   Bishop ordered a hearing on the matter and ruled that the
remnants of the now-defunct PTL television ministry can file
judgments in states where it believes the Bakkers and former top
aide David Taggart have money or property.
   Taggart was ordered to pay PTL an additional $1 million.
   The Bakkers and Taggart are believed to own property or have
money in North Carolina, California, Florida, Missouri and New
York. Any such property then could be seized by U.S. marshals.
   In January, Reynolds retired and granted a newspaper interview
in which he called Bakker a ``little sawed-off runt.'' Bakker's
attorneys used that article Thursday as evidence of their claim
that the former judge was biased and prejudiced against the Bakkers.

<HEAD>AIDS Education Program Reduces High-Risk Drug Behavior</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials say an AIDS education
program targeting intravenous drug users in Sacramento, Calif., has
reduced practices that increase the risk of transmitting the AIDS
virus.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that 23
percent of the intravenous drug users interviewed in Sacramento in
1986 said they did not share needles, or ``usually'' or ``always''
sterilized their paraphernalia.
   The report said the figure climbed to 41 percent in 1988 after
the education, prevention and testing program was begun.
   Drug users testing negative for the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) that causes AIDS were encouraged, and paid, to return after
four months for followup testing. The study said 24 percent did so,
and all continued to test negative. Of those returning, 57 percent
reported using safer shooting techniques.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the
body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to
life-threatening infections and certain cancers.
   The virus that causes the as-yet incurable disease is passed
mainly through sexual contact, shared hypodermic needles,
contaminated blood and blood products, and from infected mothers to
offspring.
   The CDC report described the gains in the Sacramento program as
``modest'' but said such programs are important in reducing the
risk of transmitting the AIDS virus.
   Worcester, Mass., has begun a similar program in jails, where
needle-users are concentrated.
   The CDC said the Sacramento program recruited drug users from
drug treatment programs, jails, public hospitals and a county
testing and counseling site. The city of 330,000 has an estimated
8,000 intravenous drug users.
   It often takes years from the time of exposure to the virus
until diagnosis of the disease, so the study measured only
behavior, not the number of AIDS cases among participants.
   In Worcester, the CDC said, surveys showed that 70 percent of
the jail inmates who used intravenous drugs had never been in a
rehabilitation program. Seventy-seven percent of those describing
themselves as recent needle users said they had shared needles.
   The study there showed that more than half of the recent needle
users at treatment clinics and rehabilitation programs had been in
jail recently and that, among recent needle users recruited in jail
for the study, 83 percent had been in jail before.
   ``The Worcester program illustrates the potential impact of HIV
prevention programs on (intravenous drug users) in correctional
institutions,'' the CDC report said.
   It said the highest instances of positive testing for the AIDS
antibody among needle users are in New York City and Puerto Rico,
between 45 percent and 60 percent.
   The report said the high rate indicates the potential for rapid
transmission of the virus to uninfected needle users.
   The report said results similar to those achieved in Sacramento
``may be more difficult to achieve'' in larger cities with larger
numbers of drug users.

   Bush did the honors today before he ended a week-long European

sapling near the rose garden on the grounds of Winfield House, the
ambassador's official residence near Regent's Park.
   The tree, a species native to New England, came from a nursery
in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in southeastern England. Most of the

<HEAD>Caribbean-Born Political Historian C.L.R. James Dead at 88</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS six grafs at bottom with biographical details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   C.L.R. James, a Caribbean-born political
historian, Marxist philosopher, novelist, political activist and
cricket writer, has died at his home above a bookshop in south
London's largely black Brixton district, colleagues said. He was 88.
   The London newspaper The Independent hailed James in an obituary
today as ``probably the most versatile and accomplished
Afro-American intellectual of the 20th century.''
   Writer and television producer Tariq Ali said James died
Wednesday. No cause of death was stated and obituary notices made
no mention of any family members.
   Frail with white hair, lean features and a quavering voice,
James exercised a considerable influence over independence
movements in Africa and the Caribbean after World War II.
   His support for Marxist revolution and sharp criticism of
opponents contrasted with his soft-spoken charm, eloquence and
gentle manner.
   Cyril Lionel Robert James was born at Tunapuna near Port of
Spain, Trinidad, in 1901 and like his father became a teacher.
   Educated at Queen's Royal College, one of the ex-British
colony's top schools, he had an encyclopedic knowledge of English
literature and history and a command of Latin and ancient Greek.
   He left Trinidad in 1932 at the urging of fellow Trinidadian
Learie Constantine, later Lord Constantine, who was then a
professional cricketer and became a political leader in Britain.
   James went to stay with Constantine at Nelson in northwest
England and published his first book, ``Life of Captain Cipriani,''
soon after his arrival.
   The book, about a Trinidadian politician agitating on behalf of
working class people there, was financed by Constantine.
   With the support of British cricket writer Neville Cardus, James
began to write about the game for the northern England newspaper
The Manchester Guardian. He later wrote books about the game, which
had been a passion with him since boyhood days.
   Moving to London later in the 1930's, he became a Marxist and
involved himself in left-wing political causes of the time.
   His close colleague at that time was fellow Trinidadian George
Padmore, a former member of the 3rd Communist International, or
Comintern, founded in Moscow.
   Padmore had been head of the Comintern department responsible
for what it called ``Negro propaganda.'' But in 1935 he broke with
Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and came to London, where he produced a
journal dedicated to African emancipation that James edited.
   James' best-known book, ``The Black Jacobins,'' was published in
1938. With the rise of fascism and the 1936 Italian invasion of
Ethiopia in mind, it told of black revolt in Haiti against French
rule during the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century.
   In a shift of political views, James came to reject Stalin's
brand of Communism, siding instead with Stalin's exiled rival Leon
Trotsky. James and Trotsky met in 1939 in Mexico. Trotsky was
assassinated there the following year at what is thought to have
been Stalin's instigation.
   Soon after publication of ``The Black Jacobins,'' which won wide
acclaim, James went to the United States, having established a
close relationship in London with the black American singer and
political activist Paul Robeson. He and Robeson worked together on
African and Negro issues.
   James spent 15 years in America, addressing books and articles
on political issues to small black, Marxist and labor groups.
   He was expelled from the United States in 1953 during the
anti-Communist campaign headed by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy and
again became involved in the African independence movement.
   James returned to Trinidad in 1958 at the invitation of Dr. Eric
Williams, the Chief Minister, to edit his party's newspaper and
later became secretary of the West Indies Federal Labor Party.
   But he differed with Williams, left Trinidad and in the 1960s
and 1970s was permitted back into the United States for a series of
college lecture tours.
   He later returned to live in Britain, where a group of admirers,
mostly young and black, gathered around him, heralding him as a
Trotskyite sage. His writing, meanwhile, inspired numerous young
intellectuals in the Caribbean.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Jewish Settlement Drops `Alien' Tags For Arab Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish settlement on the West Bank dropped
plans today to force Palestinian laborers to wear tags reading
``alien worker'' after the U.S. State Department strongly
criticized the idea as undemocratic.
   Also today, Israeli media reports said the army may restrict the
movement of West Bank settlers suspected of vigilante acts against
Palestinians.
   The reports came hours after troops stopped dozens of residents
of the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba from raiding the nearby Arab
village of Halhoul to avenge stone-throwing attacks on Israeli cars.
   On Thursday, Kiryat Arba settlers reportedly entered Halhoul,
shooting at homes and smashing windows of cars and houses.
   In another development, peace crusader Abie Nathan was charged
with supporting terrorist organizations because he met in September
with PLO chief Yasser Arafat in Tunisia and France.
   Nathan could face up to three years in prison for violating a
1986 law that bars Israelis from meeting with members of terror
organizations. Israel considers the Palestine Liberation
Organization a terror group.
   Nathan called the law ridiculous and said he has met Arafat
repeatedly since September. ``I'm ready to meet anybody, including
Satan himself, if I find an answer to questions that can save the
life of one person,'' Nathan told The Associated Press. Nathan, 61,
said the charges apparently were filed so many months after his
first meetings with Arafat because of what he described as ``the
lynching mood in this country.''
   Leaders of the Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel today
reversed an earlier decision to force Palestinian laborers to wear
``alien worker'' badges.
   The new regulations say temporary workers, both Arabs and Jews,
will undergo a security check when entering Ariel and then be
issued a card reading ``security permission to enter Ariel,'' said
Mayor Ron Nachmann. He said workers can carry the cards in their
pockets.
   The initial decision would have required only Arab workers to
wear tags. It drew strong criticism and raised comparisons with the
yellow Star of David that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany.
   On Thursday, Richard Boucher, a spokesman at the U.S. State
Department, denounced the practice as ``offensive.''
   ``In our view, this one settlement's requirement of badges for
Palestinian workers is incompatible with democratic values,''
Boucher said.
   Nachmann rejected the criticism. ``They (U.S. officials)
continue to insult us by calling us `obstacles to peace' and
`occupiers,''' he said.
   Washington's longstanding Middle East policy calls for Israeli
withdrawing from the occupied land in exchange for peace. U.S.
officials have repeatedly said the settlements are an obstacle to
such a solution.
   The army refused comment today on reports that it may restrict
the movement of certain Jewish settlers from Kiryat Arba and the
West Bank towns of Hebron and Nablus who are suspected in taking
part in vigilante raids on Arabs.
   Such restrictions would mainly affect a small group of followers
of the anti-Arab Kach movement in the three areas, the newspapers
Yediot Ahronot and Al Hamishmar reported. Settlers have stepped up
vigilante attacks in recent weeks, firing wildly in Arab villages.
In one raid, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl was shot to death by
settlers.
   Also today, an army officer was sentenced to 14 days in a
military jail for opening fire illegally while dispersing a protest
march at the Tulkarem refugee camp this week, the army said.

   Many of the nation's top editorial
cartoonists feel they're beating around the Bush.
   Whether ultraliberal or archconservative, they were awfully
gloomy for people who draw funny pictures for a living as they met
Thursday for their annual convention.
   The reason: After eight halcyon years with President Reagan and
company, they said, they face what may be the toughest challenge of
their careers _ lampooning President Bush.
   Many of the 175 members of the Association of American Editorial
Cartoonists eulogized the Reagan era as a banner decade for
cartoonists, and worried openly that Bush will be bad for business.
   ``I think George Bush is like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,''
said Dick Locher, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for his
conservative editorial cartoons in the Chicago Tribune. ``He's soft
and gentle and warm and I don't see a hell of a lot going on
there.''
   ``Reagan was such a character,'' Walter Handelsman, a cartoonist
with The Scranton (Pa.) Times, said wistfully. ``I'm not having as
much fun now. I'm doing more local issues.''
   Still, Randy Wicks of The Newhall (Calif.) Signal sees some hope
for the Bush years.
   ``We'll miss Ronald Reagan, but George Bush has possibilities,''
he said. ``His lack of charisma is probably an angle we'll all
use.''
   And many cartoonists, who listened to panel discussions and
participated in a ``cartoon jam,'' said one bright spot exists:
Vice President Quayle.
   ``I love Dan Quayle,'' said Signe Wilkinson of the Philadelphia
Daily News. ``He's the ultimate Republican affirmative-action hire.
Affirmative action for dumb, rich, white kids.''
   Others agreed.
   ``George Bush will be the first president to be eclipsed by his
vice president,'' predicted Jack Higgins of the Chicago Sun-Times,
who won this year's Pulitzer for editorial cartoons.
   Lee Judge, a cartoonist since 1981 for The Kansas City Star and
The Kansas City Times, said: ``Dan Quayle's wonderful _ he's an
idiot. You know, the worse things are going for the country, the
better things are for cartoonists.''
   But Quayle has drawbacks for cartoonists, Judge said. ``People
like Quayle with even, regular features are hard to draw,'' he
said. ``He doesn't have Michael Dukakis' eyebrows.''
   Some conservative cartoonists had another complaint: ambivalence
because their favorite candidates win office.
   ``I've had eight rotten years as a cartoonist since I've had a
guy in office that I like,'' said Dick Wright of The Providence
Journal. ``But I had four great years with Jimmy Carter. All that
guy had to do was get up in the morning.''

   As American Tom Sutherland marks his
fourth year as a hostage in Lebanon, his wife says the Bush
administration has a chance to solve Middle Eastern problems that
got him there.
   ``I live with enormous hope, but no expectations,'' said Jean
Sutherland, who was to attend a ceremony today at Iowa State
University in Ames, where she and her husband first met.
   Mrs. Sutherland said a new administration represents a prospect
for change in how the U.S. approaches the kaleidoscope of problems
affecting Lebanon.
   ``The Bush administration has a chance to do something new after
coming out of eight years in which you have had policy set,
especially after Irangate when things were put on hold,'' she said.
   Sutherland, dean of agriculture at the American University of
Beirut and a former Iowa State student, was abducted on June 9,
1985.
   Mrs. Sutherland said she and her husband were aware of the risks
involved in deciding to go to Beirut five years ago, and she feels
no bitterness or anger toward the U.S. government's handling of the
hostage situation.
   ``I felt that the integrity of our choice really rests on the
fact that we can't ask anybody to get us out of it,'' Mrs.
Sutherland.
   ``I think the issue for our government is that the hostages are
a symptom and symbol of what is wrong in that area and in the
world,'' she said. ``That is something the government needs to get
a grip on and deal with.''
   Mrs. Sutherland has continued to live in Beirut, teaching in a
special English program at American University. She said remaining
there made her feel close to her husband and gave her a sense of
continuing their life together.
   The Ames native said the ISU ceremony, where bells will toll 48
times for each month Sutherland has been in captivity, is special
to her and her husband.
   ``We really appreciate how people have stuck in there for all
these years and offered us their care and concern _ it's been a
lifeline for us,'' she said. ``We'll stick in there, even if we do
go in with no expectations, we still hope that this year is a
decisive one.''
   Before coming to Iowa, she had visited her husband's family in
his native Scotland. She will spend the actual anniversary of his
captivity in Fort Collins, Colo., with her daughters.
   ``What I'm doing is an odyssey for Tom,'' said Mrs. Sutherland.
``I think I'll be going back to Beirut and taking back all the
strength and all the friendships from here.''
   There are eight other Americans still held hostage in Lebanon.
The longest held is Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was captured March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   The attorney for Kendall L. Truitt, the sailor
who was mentioned in connection with the investigation of the USS
Iowa disaster, says he will ask the U.S. Navy today to clear his
client's name.
   Attorney Ellis Rubin of Miami said he also would announce other
demands which he plans to make of the Navy.
   ``We demand somebody in a uniform getting on television or radio
and the print media and explaining to the country that this was an
unfortunate accusation that leaked out, and that the Navy is
apologizing and is also clearing the record of this hero,'' Rubin
said on NBC's ``Today'' program.
   Truitt, appearing this morning on the same program, was asked
whether he believes his reputation has been irreparably damaged.
   He replied: ``I think it's certainly damaged. We're going to be
trying to get it cleared here shortly. We still want an apology
from the Navy.''
   Rubin said he had not received word from the Navy about whether
its investigation of the April 19 explosion had cleared Truitt. ABC
News, however, quoted Pentagon sources Thursday as saying that the
Naval Investigative Service had ruled out involvement by Truitt, a
gunner's mate 3rd class who survived the explosion.
   ABC said Navy investigators had been unable to reach any
conclusion about what caused the explosion, which killed 47 sailors.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. James Kudla said Thursday night he
could not comment on the matter because the investigation has not
been reviewed by Navy officials.
   Truitt had been named as a beneficiary of a life-insurance
policy of his friend, Clayton Hartwig, 25, who died in the blast.
   Truitt said last month he wanted the Navy to apologize for
leaking information that implicated him in the explosion. News
reports based on unidentified sources had said investigators were
exploring the relationship between Truitt and Hartwig.
   Truitt has repeatedly denied being involved with the blast. He
and Rubin have suggested the explosion may have occurred when an
inexperienced sailor pushed bags of gun powder too quickly into the
breech of the gun.

<TEXT>
   Some trucks are doing double duty of
the most distasteful kind _ hauling food to market in the East and
returning to the Midwest filled with garbage for landfills, a
newspaper reported.
   Food truckers at plazas on Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania tell of
going to Midwest landfills with 20 or more tons of baled garbage on
their return runs, the Centre Daily Times reported.
   In recent weeks, a reporter from the newspaper saw many
tractor-trailers and refrigerator trucks either carrying or being
loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station in
Pennsylvania and being unloaded at a large Ohio landfill.
   ``The fact that garbage is moving in dry vans and refrigerator
trucks that sometimes also carry food is something that's becoming
increasingly apparent,'' said Dave Pointon of the National Solid
Wastes Management Association. ``As an association, we feel it is
unhealthy, unaesthetic and unappealing, but right now, there's
nothing on the books to prohibit it.''
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture prohibits the hauling of meat
and poultry products in any vehicle that has carried inedible
cargo, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires
interstate carriers of all other food products to provide clean and
sanitary vehicles.
   But truck drivers said it was easy to get around those
regulations and officials said it was difficult to catch violators,
the newspaper reported.
   One truck from Michigan said the use of deodorizers and coffee
grounds, combined with a quick sweep, can fool federal authorities
and workers on food loading docks, the newspaper reported Sunday.
The story was reprinted today in The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   ``It boggles the imagination,'' Manfred Kroger, professor of
food science at Pennsylvania State University, told the Daily Times
last week. ``The implications of food contamination are tremendous.
It's like shipping milk to Alaska and bringing back oil in the same
truck.''
   Trucking association officials said they know nothing of the
practice. But drivers said dispatchers have been routinely steering
them to solid-waste transfer stations in Philadelphia, Allentown,
and Bloomsburg, and Jersey City, N.J., for the last year or two.
   The executive director of the Alexandria, Va.-based Interstate
Truckload Carriers Conference, Terry Turner, said last week that he
knew nothing about the hauling of food and garbage in the same
trucks. But he did say trucking companies are rushing to get cargo
to avoid returning empty from the East.
   ``The East Coast consumes so much more than it produces that
truckers trying to come out of there either cut rates, run empty,
or haul what they can haul. A truck either makes money or it
doesn't stay on the road,'' he said.
   According to the newspaper, truckers and solid-waste industry
representatives say back-hauling garbage is burgeoning because of a
lack of government and other regulations, a dwindling number of
garbage disposal sites in the East, and economic competition in the
trucking industry.
   A food industry spokesmen was astounded when he heard of the
practice.
   ``It would be the worst imaginable publicity for our products to
be in any way associated with garbage dumps or landfills,'' said
Dennis Madsen of the Washington-based National American Wholesale
Grocers Association. ``The trend in our industry is to get more
backhauls _ but certainly not garbage. I'm sure our membership
would think this abhorrent.''

   Two paramedics said they abandoned a
dying homeless man in a vacant lot because his friends reacted
angrily to the emergency treatment they tried to administer.
   ``In harm's way, you retreat,'' said Earl Riggs, president of
the Regional Ambulance Service.
   The company's unwritten policy is to leave a scene that might be
dangerous, he added.
   Ambulance company investigators on Thursday questioned the two
paramedics and a paramedic intern, who was a witness to the
incident.
   The man's friends told police the paramedics left him on the
street Wednesday because he was unable to walk unassisted to the
ambulance, but the paramedics said the friends became agitated and
appeared to be picking up rocks.
   The paramedics retreated and waited for police. The man, who
apparently suffered a heart attack, was pronounced dead when he was
taken to a hospital.
   County Emergency Medical Services Director Art Lathrop said he
will review the company's investigation, but he expects the
paramedics to be absolved of any wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today approved Sousuke Uno as prime
minister, and he pledged reforms to clear the air of an
influence-peddling scandal that has decimated the top ranks of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   The 66-year-old former foreign minister also spoke out against
the United States, saying Washington's use of its new trade law to
force concessions from Japan was ``like negotiating with your fists
up.''
   The conservative party also got new leaders and Uno chose a new
Cabinet in a bid to wipe the slate clean of the Recruit
influence-buying scandal before elections for half the upper house
of Parliament, expected within two months.
   The scandal surfaced a year ago, ruined many careers and forced
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, 65, to resign and take
responsibility for a widespread loss of trust in politics.
   The two houses of Parliament met separately today and selected
Uno as Japan's 18th postwar prime minister on the strength of the
Liberal Democrats' majorities in each chamber.
   In the lower house, Uno got 285 of 477 votes, with Japan
Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi receiving 139, Eiichi Nagasue
of the Democratic Socialist Party 26 and Kenji Miyamoto of the
Communist Party 25. Two votes were ruled invalid.
   The upper house gave Uno 124 of 220 votes, with Ms. Doi
capturing 65, Miyamoto 17 and Nagasue 9. Five ballots were blank,
officials announced.
   Earlier, the Liberal Democrats endorsed Uno to succeed Takeshita
as party president.
   Officials said Uno will follow his predecessor's policies toward
the United States but will not soften his tough response to
Washington's designation of Japan as a potential target of U.S.
trade sanctions for supercomputers, satellites and lumber.
   ``Uno is behind no one in appreciating the importance of
U.S.-Japan relations,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe
told reporters.
   The 20-member Cabinet that Uno selected was far from completely
new. At least six members of Takeshita's administration retained
their posts or took other portfolios.
   The new chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa, 67, was
asked after he announced the lineup whether he had any connection
with Recruit. He said his office had given a blank, signed receipt
to another Liberal Democrat, Shintaro Abe, in 1982, and Abe used it
to spread a donation from Recruit among several receipts so that a
single large donation would not have to be reported.
   ``To be honest with you, I don't really remember what it was,''
Shiokawa said. ``It was all a long time ago, and it was done by my
secretary and the secretary has left my office.''
   Uno today pledged political reforms to create ``the party anew''
and clear the air of the scandal that has decimated the top ranks
of Liberal Democrats.
   ``The Recruit scandal had a great impact, and I understand what
it means to be chosen as prime minister in such a situation,'' Uno
said. ``I would like to promise to carry forward political reforms
with all my loyalty and strength.''
   Asked at a news conference about his reform program, Uno gave no
specifics.
   Uno has served as director general of the Defense Agency,
minister of interational trade and industry, and foreign minister,
three of the most important Cabinet posts.
   But he has not held two of the traditional jobs on the route to
the prime ministership _ the finance portfolio and the party post
of secretary general _ and he has no independent power base within
the party.
   Some observers expect him to be an interim prime minister,
perhaps only until the upper house election in July.
   A key to his survival will be his political reform program and
the opinion of it by voters, who now give the Liberal Democrats
record-low popularity rankings.
   Recruit, an information services and publishing conglomerate, is
accused of trying to buy influence with political donations and by
letting politicians and their aides buy unlisted Recruit stock
shares, which rose in value when placed on the market.
   Takeshita and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone are among
those linked to such deals. The scandal took place during
Nakasone's 1982-87 administration.
   Prosecutors finished their probe of the Recruit scandal last
week without indicting any top-level politicians. Seventeen people,
including businessmen, bureaucrats and elected parliamentarians,
have been charged with bribery or violations of laws on political
donations.
   In his acceptance speech, Uno said he was resigning from the
Nakasone faction, taking one of the steps recommended by a party
panel on reform.
   The reform measures also called for those tainted by the Recruit
scandal to be barred from Cabinet or party leadership posts.
   Nakasone resigned from the party because of the Recruit scandal,
but he retained his seat in Parliament and analysts expect him to
retain his influence.
   Many of the Liberal Democrats' top leaders were ineligible to
succeed Takeshita because they are tainted by the scandal. Party
power brokers finally turned to Uno after elder statesman Masayoshi
Ito repeatedly refused the job.

<HEAD>Father in Life-Support Case Treated For Illegal-Drug Reaction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CICERO, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who unplugged his comatose son from
a life-support system at gunpoint six weeks ago has been released
from a hospital after being treated for a violent reaction to an
illegal drug, officials said.
   Rudy Linares, a 23-year-old house painter, was discharged
Thursday afternoon after undergoing a series of medical
evaluations, said Diane Lux, a spokeswoman for MacNeal Memorial
Hospital in Berwyn.
   Linares was admitted to the hospital early Thursday after
paramedics and police handcuffed him and forcibly transported him
there from his home, police said. He was not immediately charged
but authorities said he could face drug or parole violation charges.
   ``Mr. Linares told one of the officers he'd taken some bad
PCP,'' said Steve Zalas, Cicero deputy police superintendent. ``He
was kind of combative.'' PCP, or angel dust, is a street drug that
can induce a state similar to schizophrenia. When asked why he took
the drug, Linares told officers, ``What would you do if your son
just died?'' according to Zalas.
   Linares' lawyer, Daniel Coyne, said Linares was not a drug
abuser, but tried the drug ``purely (as) an experiment.'' The drug
had been given to him by a friend, the lawyer said.
   Doctors reported that Linares had not suffered an overdose but
merely a ``bad reaction,'' and that PCP, cocaine and alcohol were
in his blood, Coyne said.
   In April, Linares was charged with murder after he pulled a
handgun in a hospital where his 15-month-old son, Samuel, was being
kept, ordered staff from the room, and then unhooked the boy's
life-support system. He held the boy, who had been in a coma for
nine months after choking on a balloon, until he died.
   The incident sparked a widespread debate over the ethics of
keeping comatose patients with little chance of recovery alive and
the proper role of family members and medical and legal authorities.
   Prosecutors decided not to pursue the murder charge after a
grand jury refused to indict Linares on May 19. Linares did plead
guilty to a misdemeanor gun violation and was sentenced to a year
of probation and psychological counseling, if deemed necessary.
   Cicero police filed no charges against Linares in connection
with Thursday's incident, but a spokesman for the state's
attorney's office said prosecutors were looking into Linares'
admission that he used illegal drugs.
   Assistant State's Attorney Scott Nelson said any violation of
law would be a violation of Linares' probation.

<TEXT>
   A mother and daughter who independently
solicited the murders of their estranged husbands for revenge and
money were sentenced to state prison.
   Superior Judge Andrew Wagner gave a nine-year term Thursday to
Judith Lynette East, 45, and a six-year sentence to her daughter,
Venise Lynette Morris, 28.
   Both pleaded guilty in February to charges of soliciting an
undercover police detective to kill their estranged husbands.
   Victor Shuman, the detective who posed as the hired gun, said
outside court that East promised him $10,000 from an insurance
policy he believed to be worth $35,000. Morris gave him a $1,000
check and promised to pay him $4,000 more after collecting on a
$10,000 policy, he said.
   Morris told probation officers she wanted someone to kill her
estranged husband, Michael, 41, because he was acquitted by a jury
of molesting her 7-year-old daughter.
   Michael Morris was tried several years ago for child abuse, but
a jury deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal and the charges subsequently
were dismissed, according to the probation report.
   East reportedly wanted her 31-year-old estranged husband, Mark,
killed because he had been unfaithful. She showed little emotion as
the judge pronounced sentence.
   Authorities have said that neither woman apparently knew the
other was plotting to hire the same person to kill her husband.
   Neither of the intended victims, whose divorces became final
after the women were arrested in September, attended the sentencing.
   Morris' ex-husband has since moved out of California. East's
former husband is in the Navy and at sea.

<HEAD>Report Says Bradley Involved in Three Drexel Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley took actions on three
projects that stood to benefit Drexel Burnham Lambert while holding
personal investments through the firm, a newspaper reported today.
   Bradley approved Drexel's exemption from a sewer law in a
still-unbuilt $230 million development, made a video sales pitch
for a $26.9 million Drexel deal and gave final authority to allow
Drexel to be lead underwriter on a $190 million city bond issue,
the Herald Examiner reported.
   The report comes as supporters of the embattled mayor say they
fear his plans for the city could be stalled by lengthy
investigations of his personal finances.
   But the mayor's wife, Ethel Bradley, told the Los Angeles Times
her husband is determined to remain in office despite any damage to
his political career. ``All they are out to do is to try to tear
down his reputation,'' she said in an interview appearing in
today's editions.
   Bradley, re-elected to an unprecedented fifth term in April, is
facing the biggest political crisis of his career. Various city,
state and federal authorities are investigating his ties to Drexel
and two banks.
   Bradley refused to comment Thursday on his reported actions on
the three Drexel deals. Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder said he
couldn't locate a company official to comment.
   The mayor has held an investment worth from $10,000 to $100,000
with Drexel since 1979. He said the firm has been his broker in
other, unnamed stock investments.
   While holding these investments, the mayor asked the City
Council to exempt the Pershing Square Centre Associates project
brokered by Drexel from the city's growth-limiting sewer law.
   The City Council approved the exemption last year. The project
was one of only a handful of downtown developments to receive such
an exemption.
   David Houk, PSCA's chief executive, said his firm hired Drexel
in 1987. He said its role in the project had nothing to do with the
exemption and that he did not believe the mayor knew Drexel was
used.
   The amount of money Drexel earned from its involvement in the
project could not be immediately determined. PSCA has filed for
bankruptcy, and the project's future is uncertain.
   In 1984, Bradley appeared in a 12-minute videotape commissioned
by Drexel to persuade limited partners to buy $100,000 interests in
Angelus Plaza, one of the country's largest senior citizen rental
projects. It was not known how much money Drexel earned on that
deal.
   In that same year, Bradley approved a council action allowing
Drexel to join the city's housing bond underwriting team.
   Drexel became the lead underwriter of a $190 million deal to
build 1,916 apartments, the largest housing bond issue ever in the
city. The firm earned $633,333 on the deal, city officials said.
   Some of the Bradley's strongest supporters say his problems may
jeopardize downtown redevelopment and hamper other city projects.
   ``It is important to have a closure of the issue, an array of
the facts, and take whatever action that has to be done, and get it
behind us,'' said Ray Remy, president of the Greater Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce and a former deputy mayor to Bradley.

<HEAD>Developer Unveils New Plan to Build Offices Over Shakespeare Relic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developers today announced they would build an
office building on stilts to preserve the remains of the historic
Rose Theater, where William Shakespeare is believed to have debuted
as an actor.
   But protestors who have waged a campaign to save the partly
excavated theater condemned the plan as ``worse than expected.''
   The 10-story office building would stand 22 feet above the
Elizabethan theater's remains and be supported by steel girders,
the developers said.
   The theater's remains would be on view from entrances on three
sides of the office building, they said.
   The government-approved plan for the site south of the Thames
River would cost $15.8 million more than the initial plan and would
reduce some office and parking space, the developers said.
   The remains of the 16th century theater were discovered nearly
six months ago during demolition to prepare for the office
building. The Rose is the only Elizabethan theater ever uncovered.
   Shakespeare is thought to have made his debut as an actor at the
Rose in 1592 and to have acted there in his own play ``Henry VI.''
   The modified development plans were announced by property
company Imry Merchant Developers and the government agency English
Heritage after a vocal preservation campaign by 3,000 actors,
lawmakers and local residents. At one point, actors staged an
all-night vigil to protect the site from bulldozers.
   Simon Jenkins, an English Heritage official, said: ``The Rose
has been saved and people will come and see it. It has not been
cheap for Imry, but we have achieved our objective and the theater
is safe.''
   However, Anthony Grayling, a committee member of the Rose
Theater Campaign, said: ``Our reaction is of very deep
disappointment. The plans are worse than expected because they
threaten to destroy parts of the theater which hasn't yet been
excavated.''
   ``The developers will be going blindfold into something everyone
recognizes to be of tremendous architectural, cultural and
historical significance,'' Grayling said.
   The developers were submitting a planning application for the
scheme to local Southwark Council today, he said. No date was set
for work to begin.

   The story about the fish that got away
has a new twist _ Tom Foshee says he lost 500,000 head of channel
catfish when they swam off in rising flood waters.
   The Natchitoches Parish fish farmer said this week that all but
about 10 of the 160 acres of catfish ponds he has in production
were flooded when heavy rains topped the levees.
   ``We can handle a heavy rainfall, but this was probably a once
in a 100-year deal,'' he said of the floods that hit his catfish
farm last month.
   Foshee also had to drain the flooded ponds to get rid of bass,
crappie, gar, carp and various other species brought in by the high
water. Those fish feed on young catfish.
   He said the flooding will cost him about $250,000.
   Foshee said he has some catfish left, ``so we're still able to
operate. But right now, we're mainly running the hatchery trying to
get as many young ones as we can.''

   Andrei D. Sakharov, accused today of insulting the
Soviet army and heckled by his colleagues in the new Congress, said
he was proud of the exile he endured for opposing the Afghan war
and wears it ``like a medal.''
   His comments before the Congress of People's Deputies came in
response to Deputy Sergei Chervonopisky of the Komsomol Communist
youth organization, who accused the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner
of ``unprecedented badgering'' of the army, which completed its
pullout from Afghanistan in February.
   Chervonopisky demanded an explanation of an interview Sakharov
gave in Canada in which he was quoted as saying that Soviet pilots
killed soldiers they could not save from being captured by Afghan
guerrillas.
   The hall gave the Komsomol leader a standing ovation when he
finished, then heckled Sakharov.
   Sakharov, who endured his punishment in the closed city of Gorky
for opposing the Soviet military intervention that began in
December 1979, took the podium in his defense, but he was obviously
shaken by the attack and stammered as he spoke. Deputies took
advantage of pauses when he stumbled over words to mock him and try
to cut him short.
   The 68-year-old physicist said the Afghan war was a ``criminal
adventure'' that cost 1 million Afghan lives.
   ``We have to cleanse ourselves of this terrible shame,'' he
said. ``I spoke out against sending Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan,
and for this I was exiled to Gorky. I am proud of this exile in
Gorky, I wear it like a medal.''
   Sakharov denied he intended to insult the army. But he added
that charges soldiers killed their comrades in Afghanistan were
under investigation and that no one could call his statements an
insult until the truth is determined.
   But after he finished speaking several deputies hurried to the
microphone to denounce the dean of the Soviet human rights movement
before the session recessed for lunch.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, former Soviet military chief of
staff, said charges that Soviet soldiers were instructed to kill
their comrades to prevent capture were ``a blatant lie.''
   Members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo in the Kremlin
Palace of Congresses stood along with others and applauded when
Tursun Kazakova of Tashkent declared that Sakharov should be
ashamed of himself. ``You have insulted our entire army, our entire
nation, all of our boys who gave their lives,'' she shouted at him.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, a Politburo member, told reporters
later: ``I don't think you can use such second-hand information, as
he explained, to cast such a shadow on people. That's unacceptable,
inadmissible.''
   Col. Gen. Boris T. Gromov, former commander of the Soviet force
in Afghanistan, said: ``I regard Sakharov's accusation on this
question as the basest lie.''
   Besieged by reporters after the session, Sakharov said, ``I am
sorry I didn't tell the whole truth about the Soviet crimes in
Afghanistan, the napalm, the bombing.''
   Asked about the reaction to his remarks, he added: ``It was a
performance ... I think it was a contrived reaction.''
   ``I can bear it,'' he added.
   The new Congress, which has been conducting nationally broadcast
debates since May 25, remains in session with no indication when it
will adjourn. It is the first competitively elected Congress in 70
years of communist rule.
   Also today, the Communist Party's powerful Central Committee was
ordered to convene after more than a week of parliamentary sessions
in which the party's seven decades of supremacy came under repeated
attack.
   ``We'll evaluate how the work of the Congress is going,'' said
Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, who confirmed the Central
Committee would meet later today.
   The call for a meeting of the policy-making Central Committee
came as members of the party's ruling Politburo rejected
suggestions that the party surrender power or give up its
constitutional monopoly.
   One source said the committee would discuss the convening of the
new standing legislature, the Supreme Soviet, which was elected
last week and is expected to gather for the first time Saturday.
   Meanwhile, the chief of the KGB said the Supreme Soviet should
have full authority over his agency, and use U.S. congressional
oversight as its model.
   ``We are decidedly in favor of this,'' The New York Times quoted
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov as saying in today's editions. ``And as far
as the creation of a commission is concerned, I think we'll borrow
some of the experience of the Americans.''
   The Central Committee meeting comes after more than a week of
extraordinary public criticism in the new Congress.
   Party maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, a Central Committee member,
called for an immediate transfer of power from the Communist Party
to the Congress.
   He charged that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
perestroika, or restructuring, had failed and that living
conditions had declined.
   The 2,250-member Congress is the heart of Gorbachev's plan to
strengthen the government and limit the party in daily policy
decisions. But the party remains enshrined in the Soviet
Constitution as the leading force in society, and no other parties
are legal.

<HEAD>Churches Slated for Closing Sue Archdiocese in County Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of 18 Roman Catholic churches closed or
targeted for closing as part of a reorganization plan have sued the
Archdiocese of Detroit. The lawsuit filed Thursday in Wayne County
Circuit Court seeks an order allowing 16 of the churches to remain
open beyond the June 30 closing deadline so they can appeal
Cardinal Edmund Szoka's decision to the Vatican.
   It also wants Circuit Judge James Hathaway to reopen an internal
grievance process that archdiocesan officials allegedly blocked
earlier.
   The churches are among 30 that have been closed or scheduled to
close as the Detroit archdiocese seeks to reduce overhead costs and
cope with a priest shortage and other problems.
   Two of the parishes already are closed. Mary Ann Waterman, one
of five attorneys who filed the lawsuit, said she hoped both could
reopen.
   Jay Berman, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said the lawsuit
represented harassment of Szoka. He said lawyers for the
archdiocese would seek to have the suit thrown out because it
violated constitutional principles of church-state separation.
   ``We'll go through all of this, and money will be spent on both
sides that could be better used elsewhere and the outcome is
obvious before either side starts it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Grand Jury to Consider Shooting of Purse-grabbing Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A store clerk who chased a suspect in a
purse-snatching and then shot him in the back was freed from jail
when a prosecutor declined to bring charges but referred the case
to a grand jury.
   The suspect, David Adams, 22, was in critical condition today in
Methodist Hospital with a bullet lodged in his spine and police
said he may be permanently paralyzed. The shooting occurred
Wednesday evening.
   James E. Mason, a clerk at a supermarket, was released from jail
Thursday after Marion County Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith said he
would not immediately file criminal charges. A grand jury will
consider whether Mason should be charged.
   In 1985 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that police officers may
not use deadly force to stop fleeing suspects if the suspects do
not seem to be dangerous. But Goldsmith said ``the law is a little
bit confusing in this area,'' as it applies to private citizens.
   Police said a 68-year-old customer at the supermarket was in her
car while her husband brought out the groceries when a man grabbed
her purse and ran away. The husband asked store employees for help.
   Mason ran inside and told co-workers to call police, then chased
the suspect about 10 blocks in his car, shot the man in the back
and then returned the stolen handbag to its owner. He said later
that he thought the man was pulling out a weapon, but no weapon was
found. He also said he told the man to stop.
   Mason was originally charged by police with battery and
recklessness with a deadly weapon, and held overnight in a a
city-county lockup on $15,000 bond. He was freed when the
prosecutor decided not to bring charges for the time being.
   Police said Mason did not have a license to carry a firearm.
However, no criminal charges have been made on that issue.

   In January, Scott Isaacs started studying 104
dictionary words a day, the number he could fit on a piece of
computer paper. It paid off.
   Thursday, Scott, a 14-year-old eighth grader from Littleton,
Colo., won the 62nd National Spelling Bee in a spelldown with Ojas
Tejani, 12, a sixth grader from Hixson, Tenn.
   They were the last survivors of a record 222 local and regional
bee winners who were in the field when the national competition
started on Wednesday.
   The final word was ``spoliator.''
   Scott said he had studied the word, which means a spoiler, and
the only thing that made him hesitate over it was whether it ended
with ``er'' or ``or.''
   He made the right choice, and tonight will collect $1,500 at a
prize banquet. Ojas will get $1,000, and others will receive
smaller prizes.
   In an appearance today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Scott
said he had a nervous stomach Thursday morning and ``didn't feel
like getting up on the stage at all.''
   Once he was there, however, he said, ``I started recognizing a
lot more words ... and I just kept on thinking to myself, `Well, if
you can spell a lot of the words that everyone else is getting, you
have a pretty good chance of spelling the words you're getting.'''
   He was also invited today to meet with Vice President Dan
Quayle, along with all of the bee contestants from Quayle's home
state of Indiana.
   He is the 30th male champion or co-champion of the national bee.
Girls have won the crown 35 times.
   This was his third time in national competition. Altogether,
starting in the fourth grade, he has competed in 15 local, regional
and national bees and has won eight of them.
   In 1987 he placed 41st in the national competition, misspelling
psittacine, which means relating to parrots. In 1988, he flunked
telencephalon, a subdivision of the forebrain.
   ``I might be into words when I get older, or I might become a
pilot,'' he told reporters. He said he is thinking of trying for
the Air Force Academy or going to San Jose State College after high
school, but first he would like to be on the staff of the National
Spelling Bee.
   Both Scott and Ojas are engineers' sons. Bud Isaacs is an oil
engineer in Denver and Indian-born Vinay Tejani is a chemical
engineer. The boys' mothers list their occupations as homemaker.
   Scott attends Kent Denver Country Day School and Ojas goes to
St. Nicholas School in Chattanooga.
   Ojas said he studied from 40 minutes to as much as 3{ or 4 hours
a day in preparation for the competition.
   In the final rounds, Ojas correctly spelled ``saponaceous,'' an
adjective for something resembling soap, and Scott countered with
the correct spelling of ``ideaphoria,'' which is a capacity for
creative thought or imagination.
   Both spellers missed ``pasigraphy,'' which means an artificial
international written language. Ojas then missed the next word,
``senescing,'' which means growing old.
   Scott spelled the word correctly and under contest rules had to
spell the next word correctly, which he did.
   Arthur A. Hodge, 14, of Pottsville, Pa., placed third, missing
``trinklied,'' a word meaning a drinking song. Samantha Cassell of
Johnson City, Tenn., stumbled on the word ``pedicled,'' which means
having a slender stalk, and finished fourth.
   The winner's eyes brimmed with tears as he was handed the
championship trophy and friends and relatives came to the stage and
embraced him. He also received a handshake from the runner-up and
Ojas' father.

<HEAD>Government: Hitler-Stalin Pact on Baltics Still on File</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secret documents deeding the Baltic
nations to the Soviet Union were destroyed by the Nazis, but a
microfilm copy survived and has been inspected by the Soviets,
officials said today.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who visits West Germany
in less than two weeks, has called for an inquiry on the shadowy
non-aggression pact between Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin, and the
subject could come up during his visit.
   Challenging Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, independent groups
have pressed the Kremlin to admit it has been lying for more than
40 years in claiming the three Baltic republics voluntarily sought
Soviet annexation.
   West Germany's information minister, Hans Klein, said the
original non-aggression pact signed by the wartime foreign
ministers, Vyacheslav Molotov of the Soviet Union and Joachim von
Ribbentrop of Nazi Germany, survives in the West German Foreign
Ministry archives.
   But Klein and a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Juergen Chrobog,
said the secret protocols added to the pact to pave the way for
Soviet takeover of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were deliberately
destroyed by Nazi officials in the last days of World War II.
   ``However, a microfilm copy of this and other documents was
preserved by a diplomat,'' Chrobog told reporters at a news
conference.
   The protocols to the treaty signed on Aug. 23, 1939, deeded the
Baltic states to the Soviet Union and allowed Nazi Germany to
invade Poland a week later.
   The officials said they did not know details of who preserved
the microfilm that was returned to the West German archives in the
1950s, but they contended the documents shown on the microfilm are
probably the originals.
   ``It's not just presumable, we believe that it is authentic,''
Klein said when asked how Bonn could be sure it had an accurate
copy of the protocols. ``I cannot imagine how or why anyone at that
time would reproduce the documents and then make a microfilm of
them.''
   Klein said two Soviet historians traveled to Bonn a few weeks
ago to examine the documents contained in the microfilm, including
a map that shows the territories divided between the two nations.
   Chrobog was asked to detail the statements included in the
secret protocols but declined, saying their contents were
well-known and had for years been made available to qualified
researchers.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in
Moscow in August that the Kremlin has no copy of the secret
protocols.
   Soviet officials had asked the West German government about West
German records on the agreement in an ongoing effort to shed light
on the events leading up to Soviet occupation of the Baltic in 1940.
   The so-called Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement has come under close
scrutiny over the past year as Soviet reforms have allowed open
discussion about the controversial takeover and prompted an
official investigation.
   At Gorbachev's urging, the newly assembled Congress of People's
Deputies on Thursday ordered an inquiry into the events leading up
to Soviet annexation of the Baltic states.
   An official Estonian-language newspaper, Voice of the Nation,
published segments of the secret protocols Aug. 10-11, disclosing
in print for the first time that the Baltic takeover was engineered
in collusion with the Germans.

   A medical helicopter ferrying an injured
rancher to a hospital crashed, killing all four people aboard,
authorities said today.
   Wreckage of the helicopter from St. Vincent Hospital in Billings
was found by searchers about 5:15 a.m. less than a mile from the
ranch house where the aircraft had landed late Thursday, said
George Ames, a Sweet Grass County undersheriff.
   ``There was nothing left of it,'' Ames said.
   One of the victims was rancher Tommy Kalberg, believed to be in
his 50s, who had been injured in an accident involving a
three-wheeled recreational vehicle, Ames said.
   Also aboard were the pilot, a nurse and an emergency medical
technician, he said. Authorities did not immediately release their
names.
   People at the ranch told authorities that the weather was good
when the helicopter took off and that there did not appear to be
anything wrong with the aircraft, Ames said.

   A large chunk of concrete fell from the
underside of a major New York City expressway, killing a motorist
when it crashed into the roof of his car, police said today.
   A portion of the FDR Drive, an elevated roadway that winds along
the east edge of Manhattan, was closed after the 10-by-5-foot chunk
of concrete fell.
   Benjamin P. Bernstein, 49, died at 12:10 a.m. today at Bellevue
Hospital, about three hours after the accident, said a police
spokesman, Sgt. Ed Burns.
   Bernstein was driving on a local street that runs beneath the
FDR Drive when the piece of concrete dislodged and struck the car,
police said. Burns said the Department of Transportation would
investigate.
   The highway was open for the morning rush hour, but not the
street underneath at the site of the accident or nearby exit ramps.
After rush hour, two lanes of the roadway were closed for
inspection.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese sailor suffering from
appendicitis was airlifted from a ship 700 miles off San Francisco
in a dramatic 12-hour rescue by the Air National Guard, officials
said today.
   Guo Jil, 19, was in stable condition today after undergoing an
appendectomy at Stanford University Hospital, where he arrived late
Thursday, said nursing supervisor Darlene Murphy.
   The sailor's arrival at the hospital ended a rescue operation
that began at about 10:30 a.m. Thursday, when a Coast Guard C-130
transport plane from Sacramento dropped three paramedics into the
water near the ship, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Richard
Lieberman in San Francisco.
   The team was taken aboard nearly four hours later and stabilized
Guo until an Air National Guard helicopter flew in three hours
later and made the airlift, Lieberman said.
   The C-130 was sent first because it could get medics to the ship
faster than the helicopter, which had to refuel several times.
   The Coast Guard first received word of the stricken mariner
Wednesday when his ship, the Xiang Cheng, en route from China to
Panama, was about 1,100 miles southwest of San Francisco.
   The team had to wait until the ship was about 700 miles from
land before beginning the rescue, which is usually undertaken no
more than 600 miles from shore, Lieberman said.

<HEAD>Rail Workers Smash Windows During Strike for Better Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government rail workers went on a one-day
strike for better pay today and smashed windows, cut power lines
and blocked railroad tracks, authorities said.
   The walkout is the latest labor dispute involving state employee
groups opposed to the Socialist administration's efforts to keep
pay levels down to contain inflation.
   Also today, workers at the state-run Spanish Television monopoly
ended at midday their 24-hour strike for improved pay. The strike
left many of Spain's television screens showing only test patterns.
   One-day strikes today also were under way at the state telephone
monopoly and the government mint, union and company officials said.
   The RENFE state railroad reported that rail workers disrupted
service during their strike, which began at midnight and involves
63,000 workers.
   Workers delayed the departure out of Madrid and Barcelona of
several long-distance trains for up to 90 minutes early today and
temporarily blocked rail lines in the northern cities of
Valladolid, Zaragoza and Miranda de Ebro.
   Pickets also delayed four short-run trains out of Madrid by
smashing numerous windows, RENFE said. The company also said
pickets in Zaragoza had cut power cables near the city's train
station.
   The company also said 30 percent to 50 percent of regular
commuter trains ran in the major cities but only during the morning
and afternoon rush hours.
   A television union official, Joaquin Aguilar, said on Thursday
the only exceptions permitted to the total blackout were four
20-minute newscasts, followed by obligatory public service campaign
spots for the June 15 European parliamentary elections and an hour
of children's cartoons.

<HEAD>Tunnel Linking State Building and City Hall Is Misaligned</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 3rd graf to restored dropped letter in supposed.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city and state often fail to see eye-to-eye
and this time it's costing $309,000 because tunnel links intended
to connect a city and a state building don't line up.
   ``It's very embarrassing,'' said John C. Hill, a city architect.
``It's like the railroad to nowhere not meeting or a bridge
misaligned in mid-span because contractors at either end screwed up.
   ``Professionals aren't supposed to make mistakes like this,''
Hill said Thursday.
   The city hired contractors to build half of the pedway tunnel
and the state had its own contractors handle the other half to link
the two downtown buildings, City Hall and the State of Illinois
Center.
   The outcome: the state's portion is 9 inches lower than the
city's segment. It also is off by 8 inches horizontally.
   Chicago planners gave the state an elevation of 22 feet, 4
inches below ground level, but the state didn't comply with the
specifications, Hill said.
   Frank J. Conroy, project executive for the state, said the
misalignment was the city's fault.
   ``They gave us an elevation to meet and we were right on the
money. It's the city's problem. It's not my problem,'' Conroy
insisted.
   Despite blaming the state, the city has picked up the $309,000
tab for the corrections, which include an extra stairway and an
added elevator stop.
   The tunnel, which has been delayed for various reasons for the
past four years, is scheduled to open in September.

<HEAD>Boat People Stage Hunger Strike In Hong Kong</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government officials kept 1,000 newly arrived
boat people aboard their vessels today to keep them away from 5,300
hunger striking refugees who say they would rather die than go back
to Vietnam, officials said.
   About 3,300 boat people refused lunch and dinner today at
Whitehead Detention Center, joining another 2,000 who have refused
to eat since Thursday, a government spokesman said. The center
holds 5,900 refugees.
   ``They chanted slogans in Vietnamese saying they would rather
die than be sent back to Vietnam, and hung out English-language
banners saying `Live in Liberty,''' the spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
   Hunger strikers are protesting a policy that treats them as
illegal immigrants subject to repatration.
   It was adopted a year ago by Southeast Asian governments that
said most refugees are seeking better living conditions. The
countries say they will repatriate all except those who prove they
are fleeing political persecution.
   The policy has not stemmed the tide of refugees, who risk their
lives in frail boats on rough seas traveled by marauding pirates.
   Another 585 people sailed into Hong Kong waters today and were
towed to Tai A Chau, an outlying island without shelter that now
has a population of 1,000 people docked in their boats. A
government statement said they will stay there because of the
hunger strike at the detention center on the mainland.
   About 3,700 Vietnamese have arrived in Hong Kong since Sunday to
further overwhelm refugee facilities. More than 9,200 boat people
came in May, compared with 2,918 in April and 842 in March.
   Also today, an American tanker sailing for Japan saved 172
Vietnamese drifting in a small wooden boat in the South China Sea.
Taizo Watanabe, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry, said the
95,000-ton LNG Capricorn will arrive with the refugees at western
Osaka port on Tuesday.
   ``The government of Japan will follow routine procedures to
identify them and identify their wishes ... to accommodate them
temporarily in Japan,'' he told reporters.
   Chikako Saito of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
the tanker skipper reported the Vienamese vessel had developed
engine trouble and there was no food or water on board.
   The United Nations says about 72,000 boat people were in
Southeast Asian camps at the end of April. Vietnam has agreed to
attend an international conference on Indochinese refugees June
13-14 in Geneva.

   Amtrak trains dumped untreated restroom and
other wastes as they passed over a creek, dousing fishermen below,
said state officials who charged the rail service with three felony
counts of littering.
   ``It is just unfair for people out enjoying the river to be
sprayed with effluent,'' Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer said.
   State officials said Amtrak was charged with dumping wastes as
trains crossed trestles at Buffalo Bluff and Rice Creek, a
tributary of the St. Johns River.
   Commercial littering is a third-degree felony under state law
and carries a maximum $5,000 fine.
   Federal regulations governing Amtrak supersede state laws
governing the discharges from toilets and holding tanks on the
trains, Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said Thursday.
   ``I submit that the alligators in the St. Johns River produce
more effluent in the St. Johns River than an occasional Amtrak
train,'' he said.
   Bayer said Amtrak should comply with state laws and will be
arraigned on the charges before a circuit judge in Palatka later
this month. He said his office had received complaints from
fishermen who were doused by the discharge.

<TEXT>
   A Sudanese government plane bombed a
landing strip in southern Sudan as a U.N. flight unloaded famine
relief supplies, a U.N. official said today.
   Several civilians were injured in the attack Thursday at the
rebel-held city of Torit, said John Usher, a spokesman for the U.N.
Children's Fund.
   In Kenya, meanwhile, Sudan's foreign minister said his
government will begin peace talks with the rebels June 10 without
requiring any conditions for the negotiations.
   UNICEF is spearheading Operation Lifeline Sudan, a campaign to
deliver food to southern Sudan where 100,000 people are facing
starvation because of a famine caused by the war.
   A U.N. flight had landed on the air strip at Torit and was
delivering supplies when the Sudanese bomber attacked, said Usher.
   As the Sudanese bomber turned to make its second assault, the
U.N. plane took off and escaped safely. Three civilians on the
ground were injured, including a woman whose legs were mangled,
according to U.N. reports.
   The $132 million aid project seeks to distribute food to remote
areas before villages and refugee camps are cut off by rains in the
next few weeks.
   Last year, about 500,000 people died of war-induced starvation
and disease.
   UNICEF director James Grant called in Sudan's U.N. ambassador,
Amin M. Abdoun, to protest the attack. Grant said later that based
on his discussions with Sudanese Prime Minister Sadel Mahdi, he
believes the attack was not ordered by top government authorities.
   Grant requested an investigation of how and why the bombing took
place and wanted assurances it would not be repeated.
   In Nairobi, Kenya, Sudan's foreign minister, Sidahmen Elhusain,
said he had no knowledge of the bombing except what he had heard on
news reports. He called it ``an isolated incident.''
   Torit fell to the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army on Feb.
26 and has become a major redistribution center for Operation
Lifeline Sudan.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army is fighting for autonomy for
the three southern provinces, which are populated mainly by
Christians and animists.
   The Moslem-dominated government based in Khartoum has attempted
to impose Islamic law on the nation.
   Peace talks between the government and the Sudan People's
Liberation Movement are to begin June 10 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Elhusain said there would be no conditions set on the talks. He
brushed aside rebel complaints that the government still has not
met an earlier peace accord that called for abolishing the
country's strict Moslem legal code.
   The foreign minister spoke at a news conference during a visit
to neighboring Kenya which he said was meant to brief President
Daniel arap Moi on the peace process and seek his help.
   Abolishment of the Moslem code is one of the primary aims of the
rebels, but Elhusain said the purpose of the Addis Ababa talks was
to work out a means of achieving that and other goals.
   A previous pact between the government and the rebels on Nov. 16
called for elimination of Moslem law, the lifting of a state of
emergency and a permanent cease-fire in the 6-year-old civil war.
   Elhusain said Mahdi ``is in support (of the November accord) and
is pushing it fully.'' He said the government would make a
``serious, genuine, consistent'' effort to end the conflict.

   American writer Frederic Prokosch died today after
a heart attack at his home at Plan de Grasse in southern France,
his French publisher, Fayard, said. He was 81.
   Prokosch wrote several works of fiction and poetry during his

Asians,'' published in 1935. Other works include ``The Seven
Sisters'' and ``The Missolonghi Manuscript.''
   Prokosch was born May 17, 1908, in Madison, Wis., and was
educated at Yale University and King's College in Cambridge,
England.
   ``Voices,'' his memoir published in 1983, described his

   John E. List's first life as a church-going
accountant ended 18 years ago when he disappeared after the
slayings of his mother, wife and three children in their Victorian
mansion.
   His second, almost parallel existence ended Thursday when FBI
agents arrested List in an accounting office in Richmond, Va.,
wrapping up a search that had led to all 50 states, Europe and
South America.
   The arrest came 11 days after Fox television network's
``America's Most Wanted'' program broadcast details of List's case.
   The show re-enacted the slayings, and displayed photos of List
from before the killings and a sculptor's bust of how he might look
today. One viewer called to say a man resembling List was living in
the Richmond suburb of Midlothian, the FBI said.
   ``I don't know what a guy who's killed five people is supposed
to look like, but he was not that person,'' said Pat Ferguson, who
lives two doors away from the man she knew as Robert P. Clark but
who agents said was List.
   ``He worked hard in his yard, went to work every day, went to
church every Sunday. The guy was so average.''
   List is accused of shootilass 2 .52; Class 3 .48; Class 4 .41; breaking
stock .53.

<HEAD>Newspaper: School Official Suspended For Making Boys Expose Themselves</HEAD>

   An assistant principal has been
suspended for disciplining two sixth-grade boys by making them
expose themelves in the presence of a male teacher and two other
boys, a newspaper reported today.
   The two sixth-graders were being reprimanded for pulling at each
other's pants in a classroom in front of other youngsters, the New
Haven Register quoted sources as saying.
   Patricia Lyons, the assistant principal at Sheridan Middle
School, was not present when the youngsters exposed themselves in
her office as she had ordered, the newspaper said. She apparently
was trying to teach the boys a lesson.
   Lyons was suspended with pay May 26, a day after the incident,
pending a hearing scheduled for next week before Superintendent
John Dow Jr., according to Tom Ragozzino, president of the school
administrators' union.
   The union will fight the suspension, Ragozzino said.
   A person who answered the phone today at Lyons' home identified
herself as the assistant principal's daughter, but wouldn't give
her name. She said her mother did not know why she's been suspended
and that she would take the matter to court, if necessary. She said
her mother was out and took a message.
   According to the Register, the two youngsters who were
disciplined were sent to Lyons' office along with two other
youngsters who witnessed the pants-pulling incident in a classroom.
Lyons then called a male teacher into her office and left the room,
first telling the boys to expose themselves in the presence of the
others.
   The newspaper said it was unclear whether the others saw the
boys expose themselves.
   Parents of the youngsters protested to school officials.
   ``To tell students to perform an act that you are saying is
wrong doesn't make any sense,'' one parent told the newspaper.
``You don't help kids growing up with scare tactics.''

   President Bush arrived home
today after his foreign policy debut on the European stage, leaving
U.S. allies cheering his leadership at the NATO summit and bringing
``a message of hope'' for the American people.
   ``We have a great and historic opportunity to shape the changes
that are transforming Europe,'' the president said. ``In this
period of historic change, the NATO alliance has never been more
united, never been stronger.''
   On his return from London, Bush was greeted at Pease Air Force
Base by a crowd of about 2,000 people including hundreds of
flag-waving schoolchildren.
   Buoyed by positive reaction to his disarmament proposals, Bush
told the crowd: ``I am now returning from Europe with a message for
the American people _ a message of hope.''
   ``We must get to work now to end the Cold War. The world has
waited long enough,'' he said.
   Bush will spend the weekend at his oceanside retreat near here
at Kennebunkport, Maine, returning to Washington late Sunday.
   The president arranged separate meetings Monday with his Cabinet
and with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to assess
the results of his week-long tour of Rome, Brussels, Bonn and
London and the prospects for negotiated reductions in conventional
NATO and Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces.
   ``We will spare no effort to achieve agreements that will reduce
the risk of war and strengthen the foundations for peace,'' said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush capped his trip Thursday night by having dinner with
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street.
Afterward, Bush declared, ``NATO is strong. We are showing a very
solid front.''
   As Bush's black limousine pulled away, Mrs. Thatcher approached
reporters and said, ``We're very much together.''
   Asked if Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was trying to
divide the NATO alliance, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``He wouldn't
succeed. NATO is strong and the alliance is firm.
   ``We're not going to have our defenses undermined,'' she added.
   In a dinner toast, the prime minister assured Bush, ``You always
will be able to count on Britain when there is danger, when you
need us. That's why the relationship is so special.''
   Bush called Mrs. Thatcher a prime minister ``who holds the reins
of history.''
   He noted ``it was in this very city that a little more than a
century ago Karl Marx died, leaving behind ideas that were to bear
his name.''
   A succession of British prime ministers and American presidents
worked ``to stem Marxism at full tide,'' Bush said. Now ``we can
explore possibilities for peace that would have seemed widely
unrealistic just a handful of years ago.''
   ``We seek to free Europe from the shadow of Soviet military
power,'' he said.
   The farewell dinner, attended by a phalanx of British
celebrities and sporting stars, capped a week filled with praise
from Western allies for America's new president.
   The final day of Bush's trip was filled with colorful pageantry.
   Before dinner with the prime minister, the president and his
wife Barbara went to Buckingham Palace for lunch with Queen
Elizabeth II.
   When Bush's limousine pulled up to the red-carpeted Grand
Entrance of the palace, Bush jumped out. But nobody opened Mrs.
Bush's door until the queen, frowning and shaking her head, raised
her voice and said: ``Open it.''
   A U.S. Secret Service agent complied immediately and Mrs. Bush,
wearing an emerald green dress, emerged smiling as though nothing
had happened.
   Earlier in the day, Denis Thatcher, the prime minister's
husband, gave Mrs. Bush a gallant kiss on the hand when he greeted
her at 10 Downing Street.
   When photographers clamored for a repeat, a playful Mrs. Bush
clasped Denis Thatcher's hand and planted a kiss on it.
   Bush's staff was buoyant about positive reviews of the
president's performance.
   ``I hope that it might put to rest some of that speculation''
about Bush being too timid, said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   ``It is important, I think, that an American president be seen
to be leading the alliance,'' he said.
   With Thatcher's support, Bush won approval of a NATO communique
against early negotiations to reduce or eliminate short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe. He also got an endorsement of his
proposal for reducing American and Soviet combat troops in Europe
to 275,000 each.
   European newspapers gave Bush high marks, although many noted
that he acted only after Gorbachev dominated the public opinion
stage for months with his disarmament proposals.
   In Amsterdam, the left-leaning Dutch de Volkskrant said: ``The
image of George Bush as a president lacking a vision on the
development of the peace and disarmament process in Europe must be
corrected.''
   The Times of London, an independent daily, wrote that Bush ``has
proved an important point this week _ that he can change up a gear
when the international going demands it.''
   But the independent Swiss daily Le Matin said Bush's optimism
may be unfounded. ``This charm operation runs the risk of rapidly
getting bogged down in the details of the Vienna negotiations''
over conventional forces in Europe, it said.
   Bush spent his final day polishing relations with Thatcher.
There are strains over U.S. military aid to Argentina, which fought
and lost a war with Britain earlier this decade over the Falkland
Islands.
   Washington and London also are at odds over South Asian ``boat
people.'' About 750 are arriving daily in Hong Kong and the
Thatcher government would like to stem the flow and send some back
to Vietnam and Cambodia.

<HEAD>Four Killed in Bomb Attacks by Tribal Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels exploded bombs in the markets of
two towns in southeast Bangladesh, killing at least four people and
injuring 12, police said Friday.
   Police officials, contacted by telephone from Dhaka, said the
bombs were set off Thursday by members of rebel Chittagong hill
tribes who oppose local elections scheduled this month.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at
least four people were killed in Khagrachari, 110 miles southeast
of Dhaka.
   At least 12 people were injured in a blast in the neighboring
town of Rangmati, they said.
   The Chittagong tribes have been fighting a 14-year-old bush war
to protest what they consider the erosion of tribal values by
Moslem settlers from other parts of the country.
   The government blames the tribes, who are mostly Buddhist, for
about 4,000 killings since the violence began.
   Last month, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad offered the rebels
amnesty and ordered elections for semiautonomous administrative
councils in the Chittagong region, which encompasses about 5,200
square miles of hilly jungle on the border with India.
   The rebels have refused to settle for anything short of total
autonomy and oppose the elections, scheduled June 25.
   Government officials say at least 5,000 tribespeople have fled
to neighboring India in the past two weeks to escape violence they
fear will break out during the election.

   Gunmen ambushed and killed a union
leader Friday while he was on his way to work, police said.
   Police identifed the victim as Jaime Figueroa, 36, vice
president of Ramitex Workers Union, which is affiliated with the
militant May First Movement. Figueroa died of a gunshot wound to
the face, said police officer Arnold Alabastro.
   Alabastro said Figueroa and his wife were waiting for a ride to
work near his home when one of two gunmen approached him from
behind and shot him at close range with a .45-caliber pistol.
   The gunman shot at the labor leader seven times, but Figueroa
was hit only once, Alabastro said. Figueroa's wife was not harmed.
The assailants fled in a commandeered pedicab.
   The motive for the killing was unknown, Alabastro said.

   The former transportation minister was
sentenced Friday to five years in prison for taking $870,000 in
bribes while in office, court officials said.
   Judge Hong suk-che at the Seoul District Criminal Court also
ruled that Cha Kyu-hun must give up the money he received in 1987.
Cha received the money in exchange for authorizing a local business
to build a golf course.
   The prosecution had demanded 10 years in prison and the
forfeiture of the money.
   Cha, 60, was arrested in December.
   Two other businessmen, who allegedly acted as intermediaries in
the bribery scandal, were given suspended sentences.

   The crowd cheered for Ferdinand Marcos
as the youthful presidential candidate waved to his supporters.
Trouble is, it wasn't Marcos at the campaign rally more than 20
years ago.
   It was Jesus Quevenco, an affable man with such an uncanny
resemblance to Marcos that the former president called him
``brod,'' or brother.
   Quevenco, 65, said he acted as a stand-in for his famous
look-alike during Marcos' successful 1964-65 presidential campaign,
appearing at rallies and meetings where Marcos was not expected to
speak.
   The best part, he said, was getting the table of his choice at
the best restaurants and squiring Marcos' wife, Imelda. The worst
part was getting mistaken for Marcos years later, when Marcos'
popularity plummeted.
   Quevenco, no relation to the former president, said a politician
friend introduced him to Marcos in 1964 during a political rally on
Negros island. At the time, Marcos, a senator, was campaigning for
the Nationalist Party nomination for president.
   Marcos went on to win the presidency on Nov. 9, 1965. He held
office until he was ousted and forced into exile in Hawaii in a
popular uprising in February 1986.
   ``The first time we met, we just looked at each other,'' said
Quevenco. ``Marcos said `You are a dead ringer for me.'''
   For several months during the campaign, Quevenco passed himself
off as Marcos at social and political functions whenever the
president-to-be was tired or unable to attend because of schedule
conflicts.
   Quevenco said he did not receive any money for his services.
   At one appearance, Quevenco played his role so well that his
aunt rushed to him and asked to sit beside ``the president.''
   ``Auntie, I'm not Marcos,'' Quevenco said he told his befuddled
relative. ``Who are you,'' she responded? ``I'm your nephew,'' he
replied.
   During a visit to the Marcos family in Manila, Quevenco said
Marcos' brother, Pacifico, jokingly introduced him to Marcos'
mother, Josefa, as ``our illegitimate brother.''
   According to Quevenco, Mrs. Marcos removed her glasses, stared
at him and asked: ``By whom?''
   After Marcos was elected president, Quevenco said he stopped
being a stand-in, preferring to run his insurance business in the
town of Silay, 300 miles southeast of Manila.
   Quevenco said his wife, Thelma, was afraid of the risks to her
husband if he continued to pose as the controversial president.
   The resemblance was both a boon and a bane.
   ``When he was doing well, I was proud,'' Quevenco said. ``But
when he was doing badly, I got the beating.''
   During one visit to Manila, Quevenco and his friends showed up
at the Playboy Club, announced that the president had arrived and
demanded ``that a table be cleared immediately.''
   The staff complied.
   But in 1972, when Marcos' popularity was low, Quevenco said he
was nearly lynched when student protesters spotted him on a Manila
street and began shouting ``It's Marcos! It's Marcos!''
   ``I was afraid,'' he said. ``I ran down the street, ducked into
a department store, got rid of my coat, bought a pair of glasses,
and slipped away.''
   Quevenco says he has fond memories of the former president, who
is now critically ill in Hawaii and under U.S. indictment in
connection with his alleged theft of millions of dollars from the
Philippine treasury.
   Marcos' successor, Corazon Aquino, has barred Marcos from
returning home.
   Quevenco said he is neutral on the issue.

<HEAD>26-Month Sentences Imposed In Bribery Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: SUBS 12th graf bgng ``Parkin and Berlin ... '' to specify maximum
possible sentences that defendants could have received.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense consultant and a former Navy
engineer received 26-month sentences today for their roles in a
bribery scheme to obtain secret bid information to help two private
companies obtain lucrative Pentagon contracts.
   Consultant William A. Parkin, 65, and former Navy senior
engineer Stuart Berlin, 51, were also fined $25,000 apiece by U.S.
District Judge Claude Hilton for their roles in the scheme to help
Teledyne Industries Inc. and Hazeltine Corp. obtain contracts.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica acknowledged at the
separate sentencing proceedings that both Parkin and Berlin had
fully cooperated with the Justice Department's continuing
investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud.
   But Aronica said that the receipt of bribes by Berlin ``is
perhaps the most serious offense that a government official can
commit. ``It is a violation of the public trust. It is a corruption
that is motivated by nothing more than his own greed.''
   Berlin's defense attorney, Leonard Greenbaum, noted that Berlin
had actually received less than $5,000 in the conspiracy because he
was ``shortchanged at the outset'' by Parkin and others.
   Berlin, whose voice cracked during a brief statement to the
judge, called his crime ``the worst mistake that I ever made in my
life.''
   Aronica said that Parkin played a key role in the bribery
conspiracy because he dealt directly with the defense contractors.
Aronica noted that Parkin expected to obtain $272,000 in illegal
consulting fees to buy information from Berlin that would help the
two firms bid on government contracts.
   Parkin's role ``as front man and the individual to whom the
money was to be paid kept the conspiracy afloat,'' Aronica said.
   Nine days after sources say he tried to commit suicide with an
overdose of sleeping pills, Parkin, 65, pleaded guilty on March 27
to charges he indirectly paid bribes to Berlin for information to
help his corporate clients get lucrative contracts.
   After his guilty plea, Parkin was a star witness against two
Teledyne Industries Inc. executives who were convicted in April of
conspiracy in connection with the scheme to obtain inside
information on a contract to provide radar test gear to the
military.
   Berlin, 51, also testified at the trial, admitting that he took
thousands of dollars of bribes from defense consultants in return
for information that would help private companies bid on lucrative
contracts.
   Parkin and Berlin could have faced maximum possible sentences of
25 years in prison fines up to $750,000 for their crimes.
   Parkin, himself a former Navy employee, admitted he took $50,000
bribes during a 10-year period when he worked for the government
before 1983.
   The two pleaded guilty to participating in a bribery scheme with
another defense consultant, Fred Lackner of Los Angeles, to provide
inside information to Teledyne, based in Newbury Park, Calif., and
Hazeltine Corp., a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis.
   Berlin was to share $55,000 of the consulting fees that the
companies paid to Parkin for his efforts to obtain contracts,
according to testimony at the trial of the Teledyne executives.
   Eugene R. Sullivan, and George H. Kaub, the Teledyne executives,
were each convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with
the effort to obtain bid information on a radar-detection contract.
They are scheduled to be sentenced next week.
   Lackner is scheduled to be sentenced July 14 for his guilty
pleas to conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud in the scheme to bribe
Berlin.
   Teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false
statements and agreed to pay a $4.3 million fine. The company also
forfeited $4 million in future profits from an Air Force contract.

   Zeynep Ibrahimoglu was renamed Suzan Isaeva by the
state of Bulgaria, then spent 17 months in prison and two years in
internal exile for resisting the change.
   Ismet Ismailogllu was renamed Ilko Ilzev Panov. His right leg
and back are scarred _ marks he says he suffered during a police
attack for his resistance to the name change.
   The two, attending a human rights conference here, are among
hundreds of ethnic Turks expelled last month by Bulgaria for
resisting an assimilation campaign.
   The campaign went into force in 1984. It reportedly includes
banning the use of the Turkish language in public, closing mosques,
and razing Turkish cemeteries _ in short, wiping out any trace of
the Moslem Turkish minority.
   ``Now, everyone has an identity card with a Bulgarian name,''
said a Turkish delegate to the Paris conference, speaking on
condition he not be named. ``Officially, the Turks no longer
exist.''
   Bulgaria is becoming a prime target at the monthlong Conference
on the Human Dimension, the first of three such meetings mandated
in January during a session of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   The United States and other countries are expected to demand
that Bulgaria account for what Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut
Yilmaz has called ``one of the gravest human rights violations of
our time.''
   Bulgaria has repeatedly denied charges it oppresses its Turkish
minority, estimated to number 900,000 to 1.5 million in a total
population of 9 million. President Todor Zhivkov said such reports
are a ``campaign of slander'' concocted by Turkey and Western
groups.
   The plight of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria has been gaining
attention since early May, when unrest over the assimilation
campaign broke out. Official Bulgarian reports say three people
died last weekend in clashes. But reports from deported ethnic
Turks put the death toll at about 30.
   Amnesty International says about 100 ethnic Turks have died
since the assimilation campaign began.
   Six expelled Bulgarian Turks are attending the Paris conference.
They are demanding that Bulgaria restore the rights of ethnic Turks
to practice their cultural heritage or, at least, allow them to
freely leave the country.
   Habib Ibisoglu, a former member of Parliament from the port city
of Varna, said he left Bulgaria as a tourist in 1986 and never
returned.
   ``I wanted to speak of Turkish problems in Bulgaria ... and they
wouldn't let me,'' he said. ``I left to speak on the outside.''
   Mumin Gencoglu, president of the Federation of Balkan Turks and
Associations for Emigres and Refugees, says various Turkish groups
took in about 500 expelled Bulgarian Turks in May. Those expelled
often arrive in Turkey without money, possessions or family.
   ``Bulgaria is my country, but I wasn't happy there,'' Miss
Ibrahimoglu said in an interview. ``Bulgaria was for me like an
artificial mother. It wasn't my real mother. I was a second-class
citizen.''
   Miss Ibrahimoglu, 30, a language student from the village of
Kliment near the northeastern town of Shumen, said she was given a
new name and identity card on March 12, 1985.
   ``I wanted to leave Bulgaria after this,'' she said through an
interpreter. Arrested in Bucharest, Romania in front of the Turkish
Embassy, she was returned home, tried for leaving the country
illegally and sentenced to prison in Sliven.
   ``We worked, the food was terrible and when they caught me
speaking Turkish with other women, I was put alone in a cell,'' she
said.
   She then spent two years in internal exile in a town 250 miles
from her village. When the two years were up, she joined a human
rights group, which she says was the reason she was expelled Feb. 3.
   She now lives in Turkey with her mother and brother, who were
permitted to leave with her.
   Ismet Ismailogllu, expelled May 25, raises the leg of his pants
to show fresh wounds from what he says are the jaws of a police
dog. Other marks run down his back, the remnants of a beating he
says he received May 22 when military police raided his district in
Kurdzhali, in southern Bulgaria.
   Ismailogllu, 35, who worked as an accountant at a government
cooperative, was secretary of a solidarity and human rights group
for ethnic Turks.
   ``All the members of the association were beaten,'' he said.
After the raid, they were forbidden to leave their homes, ``so we
didn't even know if someone next door was dead or alive.''
   ``I will try now to love Turkey as my country,'' he said.

   Jim Wright will lose a number of privileges
when he steps down next week as House speaker, but one benefit will
remain intact _ his pension.
   Gone will be the access to limousine service. Gone will be the
use of a separate staff. The Texas Democrat, however, can expect to
receive a handsome pension for as long as he lives.
   The annual pension is based on an average of the lawmaker's
three highest salaries, multiplied by 2.5 percent and then
multiplied by his years of service _ 34 in Wright's case, according
to the House Clerk's office.
   Although Wright plans to resign as speaker on Tuesday but not
give up his House seat until later this month, the difference of a
few weeks will have little effect on his pension.

estimated that Wright's average salary was $108,333 and his pension
in the first year will be $86,666. The committee calculation is
based on a maximum pension of 80 percent of the average salary, but
it could go higher under the House Clerk's formula which says it
can be up to 80 percent of the last salary, which in Wright's case
was $115,000 a year.
   If Wright lives another 17 years, which the committee based on
the 1988 Life Insurance Fact Book, he would receive a cumulative
total of $1.47 million. Factoring in a cost-of-living increase of 5
percent, the cumulative pension will be $2.24 million.
   The Office of Personnel Management will handle the pension.
   Though his pension won't be effected by the few weeks Wright is
just a member of the House rather than its speaker, his life
insurance coverage is based on his salary, which drops from
$115,000 to $89,500.
   But the change will likely be minor since Wright's time as
simply a House member will be less than a month, said Michael
McCauley of Congress Watch, a public interest group.
   Wright's health insurance is not tied to his salary and won't be
affected.

<HEAD>Manufacturer Says It Is Taking Chemical Off Market Immediately</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of Alar announced today it is
taking the chemical off the market immediately in this country
because of the furor over its use in apple products and public
concern about its health effects.
   In announcing the decision, the Uniroyal Chemical Co. insisted
that the chemical is safe, but said it has become ``the focus of a
needless controversy'' that is severely harming the apple industry
and ``causing doubt and confusion about the safety of America's
food supply.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that
daminozide, as the chemical is technically called, causes cancer
and earlier this year urged that it be taken off the market.
   Alar is a growth regulator that enhances the appearance of
apples and increases their shelf life. The EPA estimates that it is
being used on 5 percent to 15 percent of the apple crop.
   Apple growers applauded the decision by Uniroyal.
   ``This action is most welcomed ... since it will allay any
remaining concerns consumers may have about small levels of Alar in
apples and apple products,'' said Larry Davenport, executive
director of the Processed Apples Institute.
   The apple industry in recent months has urged that Alar be taken
off the market because concern about its use has caused sharp drops
in apple and apple product sales.
   James A. Wylie, vice president and general manager of Uniroyal
Chemical, told a news conference that its customers who have
purchased Alar are being notified that they may return the product
and be reimbursed.
   The decision applies only to U.S. sales of the chemical. It
would not effect Uniroyal's sale of Alar outside the United States,
including in some countries such as Chile whose apple products are
exported to the United States.
   ``Daminozide is a safe product. It has been used safely for 20
years and with great benefit to American consumers,'' said Wylie.
He accused critics of Alar's use as waging ``a fear campaign'' that
has no justification.
   The chemical ``has become the focus of a needless controversy
that is causing doubt and confusion about the safety of America's
food supply _ a needless controversy that is hurting the apple
industry and the American public,'' said Wylie.
   Many growers have stopped using the product since concern about
it health effects gained widepread attention earlier this year.
Wylie, although not providing any specific production figures, said
sales of Alar in the United States have dropped as much as 75
percent.
   Earlier this year, a report by the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private environmental group, concluded that young
children are particularly at risk from Alar and a variety of
pesticides used on fruits and vegetables because they consume large
amounts of apple products, other fruits and vegetables.
   Although government officials maintained that levels of Alar in
apples are safe, many parents questioned whether they should
continue to provide apple products to their youngsters. School
districts in a number of major cities for a time stopped providing
apples in school lunch rooms.
   Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the Uniroyal decision represents ``a capitulation to
public opinion'' but that consumers could continue to be exposed to
the chemical because it will continue to be sold outside the United
States including in countries that export apple products to the
United States.

   Iraqi troops have resumed the forced
evacuation of thousands of ethnic Kurds, a Kurdish rebel leader
said today, calling for international help to stop the relocations.
   All 10,000 people who live in the northern Iraqi town of
Twasoran were forcibly evacuated by Iraqi troops on Wednesday,
according to a statement attributed to guerrilla leader Masoud
Barzani and read to The Associated Press by a spokesman who
insisted on anonymity.
   On Thursday, Iraqi government troops supported by tanks entered
the town of Qala Diza to begin its enforced evacuation, ``but the
people resisted the deportation order and went on a general
strike,'' the statement added.
   ``The whole region is now in a state of high tension, and we
feel that the army will massacre the civilian population,'' it said.
   Worldwide criticism earlier this year apparently forced the
Iraqi government to announce it was shelving a plan to forcibly
move the Kurdish population from Qala Diza and nearby villages to
crush the protracted Kurdish struggle for autonomy or independence.
   The Baghdad government originally had set April 25 as the
deadline for moving the Kurds out of Qala Diza, 15 miles west of
the Iranian border, before razing the city.
   The same Kurdish spokesman said last month the Iraqi authorities
had distributed leaflets and forms to the Kurdish population of the
region saying they would be transported to unknown destinations
within 20 days.
   The tough Kurdish warriors, known as Peshmerga, or ``those who
face death,'' were supported by Iran during the war with Iraq and
managed to seize control of large areas of their rugged mountain
homeland.
   But the Iraqi army has cracked down heavily on them since the
Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war in a bid to crush the
rebellion.
   ``The scale of the new displacement program is alarming as it
involves the destruction of the remaining rural district towns in
Kurdistan and the forced resettlement of nearly 300,000 people,''
said the Barzani statement.
   It added that ``the affected people will be interned in camps
and towns, located outside traditional Kurdish areas, in southern
Iraq.''
   ``We appeal in the name of humanity to the U.N.
secretary-general, governments and national and international
organisations to intervene.''
   An estimated 500,000 Kurds have been forcibly moved from their
mountain villages within the past three years, mostly to tent camps
in the sweltering southern desert near the Kuwaiti and Jordanian
borders, diplomats reported.
   More than 4,000 Kurds were killed last year in an Iraqi poison
gas attack on the city of Halabja, an incident that caused an
estimated 100,000 Kurds to flee to neighboring Turkey and Iran.
   As many as 3,000 villages have been razed in an effort to cut
off the guerrillas from their supporters, the diplomats added.
   Iraqi officials admit they have carried out large-scale
relocations among the Kurds. But they deny Kurdish claims of
genocide and have said the moves were for security reasons and to
provide the Kurds with modern homes.
   There was no comment on today's report by officials in Baghdad.
But Iraq's ambassador to Paris, Abdul Razzek Al-Hashemi, denied
Kurds were being forcibly evicted from their villages, the official
Kuwait news agency reported today.
   KUNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the envoy as saying all
people in villages along the Iranian border were asked to move to
more secure areas. He said Kurds are being resettled in model
villages within their autonomous area and are not being moved to
other districts of the country, the agency said.
   The Kurds, who have been fighting the Baghdad government for
decades recently formed an alliance known as the Iraqi Kurdistan
Front to unite six groups. Barzani signed his appeal on behalf of
this front, the spokesman said.
   There are about 20 million Kurds living mainly in Iran, Iraq and
Turkey, with small pockets in Syria and the Soviet Union.

   A Japanese freighter collided with a
Panamanian-registered container ship on Friday and sank off Japan's
northeastern coast, the coast guard said. Two Japanese seamen were
reported missing.
   The Maritime Safety Agency in Miyagi state said six patrol boats
were searching an area of the Pacific Ocean about 16 miles
northeast of Sendai.
   An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
accident occurred at about 7:20 p.m. Friday when the 495-ton
Japanese freighter Taiyo-maru with a crew of five collided with the
12,213-ton Conch. Dense fog was reported in the area at the time of
the collision, he said.
   The container ship rescued three of the five Japanese after
their boat sank, the coast guard official said.
   The Panamanian ship was sailing from Ofunato in Iwate state to
the northern Chinese port of Dalian, while the Japanese freighter
was traveling from Sendai, 190 miles northeast of Tokyo, to
Tomakomai in the north.

<TEXT>
   Something was very fishy when the boxes said
it was orange roughy and government inspectors said it was mere
smooth oreo dory.
   The food bank that got it for free just said thanks.
   The Justice Department, acting under orders from U.S. District
Judge Paul A. Simmons, turned over 248 cases, or about three tons,
of frozen fish fillets to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food
Bank on Thursday.
   Acting U.S. Attorney Charles D. Sheehy said the fish was seized
by U.S. marshals April 3 because it was mislabeled as expensive
orange roughy when it was actually less-expensive smooth oreo dory.
He said the two fish look and taste alike.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Amy Reynolds Hay said Food and Drug
Administration agents were tipped in March that the mislabeled fish
was being stored for an unidentified shipper at the New Federal
Cold Storage warehouse in Pittsburgh. She said it arrived Feb. 10.
   Government officials filed a civil forfeiture complaint against
the shipment on March 30, charging that the fish had been
mislabeled in interstate commerce, a violation of the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   When no one claimed the fish, Simmons ordered it forfeited to
the government and donated to a food bank, officials said.
   Sheehy said the McKeesport-based food bank supplies nearly 300
food pantries, shelters, soup kitchens, home-delivery programs and
community sites in Allegheny County.
   Sheehy said New Federal Cold Storage waived its charges when it
learned the fish was being donated to charity.

   China's most prominent dissident, astrophysicist
Fang Lizhi, said Friday he believes conservatives soon will crack
down on liberal intellectuals and possibly arrest him.
   But Fang said he believes six weeks of pro-democracy protests
will benefit China. ``For the first time ... students,
intellectuals and ordinary people know they have the right to
criticize the government,'' the scientist said in an interview.
   Before the demonstrations for a freer society began in
mid-April, only a few Chinese dared criticize the Communist
government publicly. Fang led the way with scathing remarks about
Marxism and calls for democratic change in this one-party state.
   His outspoken criticism resulted in his purge from the Communist
Party in early 1987 during a campaign against ``bourgeois
liberalization,'' or support for Western liberal ideals.
   He upset Chinese leaders so much that they prevented him from
attending a banquet given by President Bush during his trip to
Beijing in February.
   Chinese conservatives, led by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, again
have called for a fight against ``bourgeois liberalization'' in
their power struggle with moderates, which broke out as a result of
the protests.
   ``Deng and some other leaders always want to crack down on
liberal intellectuals,'' Fang said. He said he did not know of any
arrests yet but estimated there's a 50 percent chance he'll be
jailed.
   Fang said he has kept a low profile to prevent the government
from accusing him of being behind the protests, which led to the
imposition of martial law in Beijing.
   Last month, government spokesman Yuan Mu questioned Fang's
patriotism and said: ``The role Mr. Fang wants to play in the
current disturbances will be decided by his words and deeds.''
   An effigy of Fang marked with the word ``traitor'' was torched
at a government rally Wednesday just outside Beijing.
   ``For me personally, it's a joke,'' Fang said. The burning of
the effigy failed to stir up the rally, which quietly ended minutes
later.
   But the professor added that the tactics were reminiscent of the
Red Guards who terrorized the country during much of the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   ``If society keeps quiet, orderly and non-violent ... I think
I'm safe,'' Fang said. ``If the government organizes some chaos ...
like the Red Guards, then I'm in danger.''
   Fang believes that although conservative leaders want a strong
crackdown, there is little support for such a move, even among
rank-and-file party members.
   Fang believes China will benefit from the uprising, despite the
apparent ascendancy of hardliners in the power struggle. He drew an
analogy with Poland, where martial law could not quash the
Solidarity trade union.
   ``The people don't believe in Deng. He already lost his face,''
Fang said.
   The demonstrations show that Chinese believe they are entitled
to rights such as a free press and freedom of speech, Fang said.
While Marxist orthodoxy demands the Communist Party guide the
people, there is now a widespread feeling that government must
serve the people, he added.
   ``We need the older generation of the leadership gone, like
Deng,'' Fang said. ``If they leave, the situation will be better.
It means more democracy.''

   The Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus lost
spiritual treasures when four sixth-century Byzantine mosaics were
removed from a church in northern Cyprus, a church abbot testified.
   The mosaics are at the center of a legal battle pitting the
church and the Greek Cypriot government against Indianapolis art
dealer Peg Goldberg, who purchased them for $1.1 million last
summer.
   The church claims the early Christian mosaics were ripped from
the walls of the church and smuggled out of the troubled
Mediterranean island nation.
   ``The church wants the mosaics back because they are our
spiritual treasures,'' Abbot Paul of Macheras testified in U.S.
District Court Thursday. The trial resumed today.
   ``They were once put up on the wall and they were sanctified
through the prayers and holy literature. They are a part of our
sacred life.''
   The bearded abbot, wearing a flowing black headdress and robe
and carrying a black staff topped with gold, said the archbishop
had never allowed the mosaics to be removed from the church of
Panagia Kanakaria.
   The church is in an area controlled by a Turkish breakaway state
recognized by no countries other than Turkey. Most Greek Cypriots
have left the area since it came under Turkish control in 1974.
   Athanasis Papageorghiou, acting director of Cypriot antiquities,
said the removal of the mosaics was part of a widespread pattern of
looting in churches in northern Cyprus.
   Judge James E. Noland accepted the pre-trial deposition of
Ronald Faulk, a Los Angeles attorney who helped arrange the
purchase of the mosaics in Switzerland.
   Faulk's deposition said Aydin Dikmen, a Turkish national living
in Germany, agreed to sell the mosaics for $350,000.
   Dikmen was paid $350,000 and Faulk received $80,000. Robert
Fitzgerald, an Indianapolis art dealer who brought Goldberg into
the deal, got the remaining $650,000, said Faulk, who represents
Fitzgerald.
   Fitzgerald testified today that Goldberg obtained a bank loan of
$1.2 million to buy the mosaics, and he was paid $300,000 for his
role in the deal. In addition, he will receive almost a quarter of
the profits if Goldberg is allowed to sell the mosaics, he said.
   Goldberg's bill of sale listed a purchase price of $1,080,000,
according to court records.
   The mosaics, pieced together by an unknown artist about 525
A.D., are representations of Christ as a boy, the apostles James
and Matthew, and an archangel.
   They are among only a handful of Byzantine icons surviving from
the first centuries of Christianity, experts say.
   Goldberg has offered to sell the mosaics for $20 million to the
J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.

   Canada's reported AIDS cases have passed 2,700 as
it prepares to hold the fifth annual world conference on the fatal
disease.
   Although the number is a fraction of the 94,000 in the United
States, the much smaller population of 26 million puts Canada in
the upper tier of countries on a per capita basis.
   Leaders of AIDS community groups in major cities contend that,
years after acquired immune deficiency syndrome became known, the
federal government still has not developed a a coherent national
strategy.
   ``We're now in 1989; we've known about AIDS since 1982,'' said
Richard Burzysnki, executive director of the Canadian AIDS Society.
``We should have been planning years ago.''
   The Fifth International Conference on AIDS runs from Sunday
through next Friday in Montreal and will bring together more than
10,000 scientific, government and community leaders. Last year's
meeting was in Stockholm, Sweden.
   Canada's federal policy for civil servants announced in May was
presented as an example of how the government can act effectively.
It includes confidentiality and a statement that people with the
disease are not health risks to others under normal working
conditions.
   The Toronto Globe and Mail called the policy ``a triumph of
common sense.'' It said Health Minister Perrin Beatty acted not
merely to soothe a lobby group, but ``because to do nothing would
amount to setting off a ticking bomb.''
   In Canada, the number of reported AIDS cases reached 2,736 at
the end of May, and 1,564 of the victims had died, according to the
Federal Center for AIDS. The center says the total of cases is
doubling every 18 months, and unofficial estimates put the number
of Canadians infected at 50,000.
   Just five years ago, the number of cases was 331, and 283 had
died.
   Burzysnki, whose organization lobbies in Ottawa for 39 AIDS
community groups across the country, said much of the
responsibility for health and education rests with provincial
governments.
   He said the efforts vary widely, and what is needed from the
federal government is ``the political will to galvanize'' the
diverse levels and groups into an effective campaign.
   Margaret Duckett, an AIDS expert at McGill University's Center
for Medicine, Ethics and the Law in Montreal, said providing
information on how to prevent the disease is not enough.
   ``You need a range of messages, and you need people talking
one-to-one,'' she said. ``In that, there's been relatively little
occurring in Canada.''
   Nearly 90 percent of AIDS cases are in Ontario, Quebec and
British Columbia, which have Canada's largest cities: Toronto,
Montreal and Vancouver.
   About 81 percent of the known cases are attributed to a risk
factor of homosexual and bisexual activity.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.
   Dr. Alastair Clayton, director of the Federal Center for AIDS,
said the government has tried to promote educational programs and
finance community groups needed to carry them out.
   ``There's never enough money to do all the things one wants,''
he said by telephone from Ottawa. ``My job is to try to balance the
funding.''
   A five-year budget of $167 million ($139 million U.S.) beginning
in 1986 is divided among education, support for community groups,
research and health and social services.
   ``Canada isn't much of an example. The country's record is
pretty abysmal,'' said Tim McCaskell of AIDS Action Now, which led
a campaign for more liberal licensing of drugs for the disease.
   National health insurance covers everyone, but does not include
medicine, housing or the other living costs that can accumulate
rapidly for AIDS victims.
   ``People with AIDS become poor very fast,'' said Stephen
Manning, executive director of the AIDS Committee of Toronto.
   His organization has new quarters, a full-time staff of 25 and a
budget of $1.3 million ($1 million U.S.), about three-quarters of
the money in grants from various levels of government.
   It started six years ago above a poultry store.

<HEAD>Seven Abandoned Brothers Settle Estate to Keep Farm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven brothers who struggled to remain
together after their mother died and their father abandoned them
will be given their grandfather's farm as a result of a probate
agreement.
   The agreement filed in Hall County Probate Court last week
provides the 7.4-acre farm of Cecil O'Kelley in Tadmore to the
seven grandsons.
   A problem arose when O'Kelley's widow, Mary Evelyn, filed last
year for $16,000 in support from her husband's estate. When
O'Kelley died in 1985 he left an overdrawn checking account and an
overdue note on the land, so there was no way to pay Mrs. O'Kelley
without selling the farm.
   The agreement sells the farm to a trust fund set up for the
seven O'Kelley brothers by benefactors touched by their plight. The
fund, which has exceeded $100,000, will make back payments and will
provide $4,000 to Mrs. O'Kelley.
   The boys' mother died in 1983 of a brain tumor, telling the
oldest, Terry O'Kelley, that her last wish was for the brothers to
remain together.
   They stayed with their grandfather until his death left them in
the hands of Thomas O'Kelley, their alcoholic father. He stripped
the farm of its chicken houses and lumber, then left and was
convicted of abandonment.
   The brothers, then aged from 17 to 7, tried to tough it out
alone on the ranch but lost all they had when the converted trailer
they lived in burned.
   Benefactors built a four-bedroom house for the boys and an
anonymous donor gave property next to their farm. A chicken house
on that land later burned, killing 3,500 birds. Investigators
blamed arsonists but no arrests were made.
   Terry O'Kelley, now 21, lives with his wife and infant son in a
house on the donated chicken farm. He works in a carpet mill.
   Two boys live in the house that was built for the brothers, two
live with relatives and the youngest two are in a boarding school
in Rome, Ga.
   Terry O'Kelley remains the legal guardian for his brothers who
still are minors.

   The Senate picked its way today through a $3.3
billion bill aimed at financing agencies whose treasuries are
running dry, but also toting provisions spreading federal largess
to lawmakers' pet projects.
   As they finished work on the bill for the week, senators voted
by voice to allow the shipment of up to $12 million in food aid to
Haiti.
   Most forms of U.S. assistance to the Caribbean nation have been
prohibited by law because of human rights abuses in the country.
But Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the provision's sponsor, said
resumption of aid would be ``a recognition of progress that has
been made'' by the Haitian government.
   On a voice vote, the Senate added a provision urging the
Agriculture Department to buy more apples to help sagging sales
caused by findings that Alar, a growth enhancer sprayed on some
apples, can cause cancer. The measure was sponsored by Sens. Brock
Adams, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., whose home state is one
of the nation's leading apple producers.
   Senate leaders had hoped to complete work on the measure
Thursday and begin negotiations next week with the House, which has
already approved a $3.7 billion rendition of the bill. The
legislation covers the final four months of fiscal 1989.
   But the Senate spent much of its nearly 14 hours of work
Thursday debating an assortment of amendments aimed at boosting
federal anti-drug initiatives by as much as $1.8 billion. All of
them failed by wide margins as lawmakers heeded Bush administration
warnings that inclusion of the drug funds would pump up the federal
deficit and could spark a veto of the entire bill.
   ``When are we going to end this effort to pile more money into
this bill for drugs?'' a frustrated Senate Appropriations Chairman
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., asked at one point.
   The House bill includes $822 million for treatment programs,
tougher law enforcement, and other anti-drug efforts.
   Senate completion of a measure without any drug funds, now
anticipated for next week, would augur a clash with the House when
the two chambers try to work out a compromise bill. In a policy
statement Thursday, the administration said it considered the
Senate bill ``a major improvement'' over the House version.
   The largest portion of both bills is $1.2 billion for health,
benefit increases and other programs for veterans. The Department
of Veterans Affairs has already begun curtailing the number of
patients it treats at its hospitals and clinics, and further
reductions have been threatened.
   The Senate legislation provides $892 million for the Guaranteed
Student Loan program for college students, $423 million for state
foster care programs, $342 million for the expenses of battling
last year's forest fires, $225 million for the food stamps program,
$125 million for United Nations peacekeeping forces, and $100
million to help Soviet and other refugees to this country.
   Also in the Senate measure is money for projects in the home
states of many members of the appropriations panel, standard
procedure for spending bills.
   The legislation contains $75 million to rebuild a demolished
300-foot radio telescope in West Virginia, Byrd's home state; $7.3
million to clean up the oil spill in Republican Sen. Ted Stevens'
Alaska; $1.6 million for job training in Philadelphia, represented
by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; and $200,000 for the University of
South Carolina, compliments of Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., to
study drug abuse among blacks.
   Amendments adopted Thursday include one by Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan., setting aside $275,000 for Kansas State University to
provide information for farmers on coping with the drought.
   Another provision urges the federal court in New York handling
Eastern Airlines' bankruptcy proceedings to consider appointing an
independent trustee to replace chief executive Frank Lorenzo in
running the strike-bound carrier.
   Another would provide an extra $1 million for development of
orphan drugs, medications that companies find unprofitable to
produce because the diseases they treat are so rare.
   Yet another expresed the Senate's desire to prevent appointment
of a Panama Canal Commission chief nominated by Panamanian ruler
Manuel Antonio Noriega. By treaty, the Panamanian government can
name a new administrator for the commission, a nomination the
Senate must approve.

   Joseph Pikul, a former Wall Street
securities analyst who was convicted in March of murdering his
second wife, died this morning, his attorney said. He was 54.
   Pikul's doctor told his third wife that Pikul died of heart
failure stemming from cancer of the liver and small intestine,
attorney Ronald Bekoff said.
   Pikul, confined in the Orange County Jail without bail following
his second-degree murder conviction, was admitted to Arden Hill
Hospital in poor condition after fainting last Friday, said his
third wife, Mary Bain Pikul.
   An autopsy was planned, but hospital officials did not know when
it would be done. Neither hospital nor police officials would
comment of the nature of Pikul's death.
   A jury convicted Pikul of murdering his 44-year-old second wife,
Diane, on Oct. 24, 1987. Pikul said he killed his wife when she
attacked him with a knife after a quarrel over an unfamiliar brand
of condoms he'd found under her bed.
   Prosecutors said her beating and strangulation were motivated by
Pikul's fear of losing the couple's two children and by Mrs.
Pikul's threats to blackmail him because she had pictures of him
wearing women's clothing. Police say Pikul was wearing women's
undergarments when he was strip-searched after his arrest.

   Remembering numbers is a piece of pi for
Srinivasan Mahadevan.
   Mahadevan's extraordinary memory has allowed him to memorize the
first 35,000 digits of pi _ the theoretically infinite computation
of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
   Mahadevan, a graduate student at Kansas State University in
Manhattan, is trying to become the fourth person to remember the
first 100,000 digits of pi and is the subject of a $157,000 federal
study at Kansas State University.
   Researchers hope to find out how Mahadevan's amazing memory
works. The answer may shed light on how other people remember
things.
   ``We're hoping to find insights into the average intelligence,
too,'' said Rod Vogl, a graduate assistant in charge of
administering tests.
   Four students with average memories are being studied as a
control group. They can usually remember seven to eight numbers
that are flashed quickly on a screen or spoken; anything above 10
is considered exceptional. Mahadevan typically tallies about 38 if
he sees the numbers, about 50 if hears them.
   That's under clinical conditions. Vogl says Mahadevan usually
scores much better _ as many as 105 _ in the less inhibiting
atmosphere of the local watering holes where he has been known to
win some astounding bar bets.
   The 30-year-old native of Mangalore, India, thinks heredity and
his childhood environment both played significant roles. ``My
father knows all 37 plays and 150 sonnets of William Shakespeare by
heart, so I think there is a genetic basis for it.''
   Only three cases of the ability to remember 100,000 digits of pi
have been documented in 200 years. One of those people became
insane when he became unable to forget anything and his reasoning
processes drowned in a flood of facts.

   What famous redhead won't work more than
30 to 40 minutes without a break, never works more than two days in
a row, yet remains one of the hottest advertising stars on TV?
   Morris the Cat kicked off his seven-city tour of animal shelters
on Thursday to promote National Adopt-a-Cat Month and a new animal
shelter in Des Moines.
   Ken Nixon, executive director of the Animal Rescue League of Des
Moines, said about 125 people came to see Morris, including 75
Woodlawn School students who had raised $350 for the shelter.
   More than 1.3 million cats have been adopted through the annual
June promotion since it began 15 years ago, said Bob Martwick,
Morris' trainer. The tour is sponsored by the American Humane
Society and 9-Lives Cat Food.
   Martwick said both the current Morris and the original Morris,
who died about 10 years ago, were found in animal shelters.
   The trainer said timing is the hardest part of filming the
9-Live commercials. Because the soundtracks are made first, he
said, ``if he (Morris) has to turn his head ... and he's a
half-second off, then it doesn't work.''
   ``Sometimes we'll throw something, try to make a noise. We've
even had pigeons flapping their wings to get his attention,'' he
said.

   A state university that 31 years ago refused

   Lewis, D-Ga., was given the honorary doctor of laws degree by
Troy State University Chancellor Ralph Adams. Lewis, who made no

   Lewis is a native of Pike County, where Troy State is located.
He has said that in 1958 he applied for admission to what was then
Troy State College, but never received a response from the then
all-white school.
   Lewis said he joined the civil rights effort after sending a

already was a recognized leader in the movement.
   Officials at Troy State have said they had no record of Lewis'

<HEAD>Student Leader Expelled; Others Arrested After Protesting Bans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white student leader has been
expelled from one of the country's most prestigious universities
for protesting racial segregation of dormitories, school officials
said Friday.
   Leslie Durr, 21, was expelled from the University of
Stellenbosch following a disciplinary hearing Thursday.
   She was president of the Stellenbosch branch of the
anti-apartheid National Union of South African Students, which
officials banned from operating on the campus for four months.
   A similar ban was imposed on a group representing the
university's black students.
   At the nearby University of Cape Town on Friday, 22 students
were arrested when they protested the ban on the groups, witnesses
said.
   About 1,500 Stellenbosch students also staged a noon rally in
protest, but there were no arrests.
   The banned student groups helped coordinate a protest two weeks
ago of the university's policy of housing non-white students in a
separate dormitory. About 100 students and teachers participated,
and they were pelted with food by a few other students.
   Stellenbosch, in a scenic wine-growing region near Cape Town,
has about 13,300 white students and about 500 who are black, Asian
or mixed-race. It is considered the best and the most liberal of
South Africa's five Afrikaans-language universities.
   The University of Cape Town is one of the country's premier
English-speaking universities.
   Stellenbosch officials banned student protests in 1985. The
school's chief administrator, Rector Mike de Vries, said Friday the
disciplinary measures were taken because the ban was broken, not
because of the protesters' views about segregated dormitories.
   Ms. Durr, an honors student in philosophy, told reporters that
university authorities were using her as a scapegoat.

   Ohio Republican Rep. Donald E. Lukens said
today that despite calls for his resignation by GOP leaders, he
will stay in Congress while he appeals his conviction a week ago of
having sex with a 16-year-old girl.
   ``If I have caused pain and embarrassment to my family, friends
or supporters, I apologize,'' Lukens said in a statement released
at his Capitol Hill office. ``But I refuse to allow the lies and
deceit of one delinquent individual to ruin me. I am now fighting
for my life.''
   Lukens' statement contended his accuser had a ``10-year record
of psychological problems and illegal activity'' but the court
refused to listen to the evidence.
   ``My legal counselors assure me that prospects for a reversal in
my case are excellent. Only at that time will I make my final
decision regarding any future political activity,'' he said.
   Lukens, 58, was convicted May 26 of a misdemeanor charge of
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor following
a five-day trial in Franklin County Domestic Relations Court. A
jury found Lukens guilty of having sex with a girl at his Columbus
apartment Nov. 6 when she was 16.
   Ohio Republican Party Chairman Robert Bennett and GOP leaders
from Lukens' home district on Thursday urged Lukens to resign from
Congress and from the Republican State Committee.
   Meanwhile, a Columbus television station reported Thursday that
a teen-age girl said she also had sex with Lukens in 1985 when she
was 15.
   WSYX-TV said the girl, identified only as ``Paris,'' had been
sought by the grand jury to testify in Lukens' case but was not
found. The station said Lukens paid the girl for sex on five or six
occasions.
   Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller told the AP the girl
interviewed on television had refused to cooperate with the
investigation that led to the charges against Lukens. He said he
didn't plan to reopen the investigation.
   A conviction of a misdemeanor does not prohibit a congressman
from remaining in office or seeking re-election.
   But state GOP chairman Bennett said he informed Lukens' office
Thursday that he will not be on the party's ticket in 1990. He said
he spoke with Lukens Wednesday night and conferred with party
leaders in the congressman's western Ohio district before making
the decision.
   ``I think he is a bad apple for the Republican Party,'' Bennett
said. ``He has lost the support of the entire Republican leadership
of his district.''
   Don Birgel, chairman of the Butler County GOP in Lukens'
district, said Lukens should resign because ``a party is known by
the leaders it keeps.''
   Lukens wasn't bitter at party leaders, but doesn't plan to take
their advice, said William Jarrell, Lukens' chief of staff.
   ``This is a ... move where the party distances itself from
Lukens. They have their own pressures they have to react to,''
Jarrell said. ``Congressman Lukens came into politics as as a
fighter, and right now he is ... fighting for his life.''

<HEAD>Uno Promises `Clean Start' After Political Scandal</HEAD>

   Sousuke Uno became Japan's new prime minister
Friday and pledged to ``make a clean start'' after months of a
bribery scandal that shook the establishment and soiled the image
of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   Parliament approved Uno early in the day, ending the party's
five-week search for someone unblemished by the scandal, in which
Recruit Co. is accused of trying to buy influence with cut-price
stock and huge campaign donations.
   He had been foreign minister and replaces Noboru Takeshita, who
resigned to take responsibility for the scandal.
   In a suggestion of a tougher line on trade policy, Uno told
reporters the American use of threats to gain trade concessions
from Japan was ``like negotiating with your fists up.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said, however, that
the new administration would practice ``consistency and
continuity'' in foreign policy.
   Uno, 66, said political reform would be his first priority.
   His party, in power since it was formed in 1955, has sunk to an
all-time low in opinion polls because of the scandal. It needs a
boost before elections this summer for half the upper house, but
Uno's initial appointments were unlikely to provide one.
   Ryutaro Hashimoto, his choice for party secretary-general, told
reporters Friday he had received 2.4 million yen ($17,000) in
1985-86 from Recruit Co., a data and publishing conglomerate.
   His new chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa, said he had
given a blank signed receipt to another Liberal Democrat, who
divided a large donation from Recruit among several such receipts
to get around reporting requirements.
   Analysts said the appointments indicated a continuation of
Takeshita's policies.
   At least six ministers in the 20-member government that Uno
installed Friday are carry-overs from Takeshita's Cabinet, and
several others served in previous administrations.
   The Cabinet appeared to be carefully balanced among the various
Liberal Democratic factions, despite a reform committee's
recommendation that the faction system be abolished.
   Factional divisions within the party, based more on personal and
financial allegiances than political philosophy, are widely blamed
for creating the competition for funds that led to the scandal.
   At a news conference, Uno rejected opposition demands for a
general election and said: ``As head of the party, I'd like to
devote myself entirely to the party and political reforms.''
   He said the scandal ``has had a dramatic effect on our party. I
would like to take this opportunity to reflect on this development
so we can make a clean start in politics and regain the confidence
of the people.''
   Money that party members improperly received from Recruit will
be returned to the people, he said, but did not indicate how that
would be done.
   Of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cut-rate
stock offered by Recruit, 13 were Liberal Democrats.
   Uno is said to have avoided involvement in the scandal, in part
because he was not an aggressive fundraiser.
   Opposition leaders and some Liberal Democrats criticized the
choice of Uno because he belongs to the party faction of former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, during whose administration in
1982-87 the Recruit scandal developed.
   Nakasone has resigned from the party but retained his seat in
Parliament, and analysts expect his influence to continue.
   Uno is from Shiga prefecture in western Japan, where his family
owns a brewery. Stores in Tokyo have begun promoting Uno Honke, a
family brand of rice wine, and report brisk sales.

   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said today
that any Justice Department employees found to have leaked
information about an investigation into the office of Rep. William
Gray, D-Pa., would face the risk of being fired.
   ``They have no place in the Department of Justice,'' Thornburgh
told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Thornburgh came to Capitol Hill to discuss the role of the
American Bar Association in the judicial selection process.
   But Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., immediately asked Thornburgh
about a report that FBI agents visited Gray concerning an
investigation involving his office.
   Thornburgh said he has requested the No. 2 man in the Justice
Department, Edward Dennis, to investigate how the information
reached the news media.
   ``He will have available to him whatever resources are necessary
to pursue these reports,'' Thornburgh said.
   The attorney general said that if the ``perpetrators'' were
discovered it was likely that ``they will be fired immediately.''
   Thornburgh was critical of ``our friends in the news media'' for
airing reports of the investigation. He also said he wished that
journalists would help find the leakers.
   ``It's extremely difficult to pursue these investigations
without the cooperation of those in the news media,'' he said. ``I
can say without fear of contradiction that if we did have the
cooperation of the news media in these investigations, every leaker
in town would be gone before sundown.''
   Thornburgh said it was possible that there may have been
criminal conduct involved in unauthorized disclosures in the news
media. He did not elaborate on that theme.
   Prompted by Biden, Thornburgh promised to report back to the
Judiciary Committee on the results of the investigation and tell
the panel what methods it had used to come up with its findings.
   Biden urged Thornburgh to assign the investigative task to the
department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
   He noted that Dennis formerly was a U.S. district attorney in
Philadelphia and said he would not advise ``putting Mr. Dennis, a
fine, honorable man, in the position of having to investigate
people he hired.''
   At one point in the proceedings, Thornburgh described the news
media as ``aiders and abetters'' of unauthorized disclosures of
sensitive information. He told reporters in a hallway later,
though, ``It was perhaps an ill-chosen word.''

   Northwest loggers spruced up more than 100
logging trucks for a parade past the tony shops of Seattle's Fifth
Avenue, hoping to gain city dwellers' support for an industry beset
by environmental concerns.
   ``The problem with loggers in Washington state is we have this
lumberjack image,'' said Bill Pickell, head of the Washington
Contract Loggers Association. ``You mention loggers are coming to
town, and you scare people to death. ... We're business people, not
big, dumb oafs.''
   Entire logging families turned out for today's parade, with the
children deputized to hand out ribbon-bedecked Douglas Fir
seedlings as the convoy rolled through downtown Seattle.
   Drivers leaned on the airhorns as about 125 vehicles moved
briskly down two lanes of the three-lane avenue. The trucks,
including log, lumber, firewood and chip haulers, were cleaned and
shined and adorned with signs, such as ``Support the Timber
Industry'' and ``Lumber for 1.7 Million New Homes.''
   Several hundred people, mostly passersby, paused to watch the
parade, and were met on the sidewalks by timber supporters with
leaflets, placards and the free trees.
   ``Keep My Dad Off the Street _ Save His Job,'' read a sign
carried by one teen-age boy.
   A logging equipment company pledged a flatbed truck bearing a
``log skidder,'' a machine that drags cut logs to a loading area.
Weyerhaeuser Co., the giant forest products concern, said it was
sending a truckload of lumber.
   Management of the region's forests has become an important
issue, as shown by the recent court fights to prevent logging in
areas inhabited by northern spotted owls.
   The loggers association, which is helping sponsor the parade,
hopes to show urban residents that a threat to their industry is
also a threat to Seattle's economy, Pickell said.
   ``We've got to bring our story to the urban areas, where the
consumers are and the votes are,'' Pickell said. ``The Seattle area
enjoys a quality of life which is permeated by the timber
industry.''
   Nearly 40,000 people statewide worked in the lumber and wood
products industry in 1987, said Marc Blegen, a program coordinator
with the state Employment Security Department.
   Timber interests have vowed to fight federal lawsuits by
environmentalists that would bar logging of old growth timber in
areas inhabited by spotted owls. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
has proposed that the owl be listed as a threatened species, and
some 165 timber sales on Forest Service lands in Washington and
Oregon have been halted while the courts consider the issue.
   The timber industry has accused environmentalists of spreading
misinformation about the owl to halt all logging of the huge,
ancient trees.
   John Cloninger of the small town of Startup has made a living in
timber since 1946 and said he's watched it ``deteriorate and
deteriorate. ... Now it's gotten to be so that people can't make a
living.''
   Cloninger pledged two of his eight log trucks to the parade. He
said he wanted to show that loggers are regular folks with concerns
about their livelihoods who have been given a bad rap as poor
forest managers.
   ``What a lot of people don't understand is that loggers are
environmental people. When I get loose (from work), I take my
horses and go to the mountains.''

<HEAD>What Happens When Poetry Meets MTV? Video Verse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Casella wants his MTV. Only with
poetry.
   With the production of his first Poetry Television videotape,
Casella hopes to popularize poetry through PTV.
   ``It's a pretty blatant ripoff of Music Television, which is so
common now it's an adjective unto itself,'' Casella said. ``But
poetry can be so cool. It just doesn't get out anywhere. ''
   Casella, 24, attending the writers workshop at the University of
Iowa, is hoping that will change. His 50-minute PTV video, which he
spent four months putting together, is a collection of 35 poems by
15 other members of the graduate writers workshop.
   As poetry is read, words, designs and images swirl onto the
screen. Some poems are illustrated by videotape. Some show nothing
but a closeup of the poet with different lighting projected in the
background.
   Some of the poets puff on cigarettes. Others use profanity. One
reads in Spanish.
   Casella, who has an interest in cinematography, designed most of
the background graphics and lighting, occasionally collaborating
with the authors. He said it only cost $162 to make the tape, some
of which was paid for by a grant.
   ``MTV works because the music and the video complement each
other. You can sit back and watch,'' he said. ``Here, my biggest
conflict is that it's so easy to make an image look good. It's so
easy to make it look interesting. But you have to pay attention
too. I don't want to take away from the poems.''
   Casella's PTV video went on sale this week for $10 at the
Prairie Lights bookstore in Iowa City. It is scheduled for three
airings this month on the university's campus channel, which can be
seen in Iowa City, Solon, Cedar Rapids and North Liberty.
   Casella has sent copies of the video to Dartmouth, Cornell and
Colgate universities, the University of Chicago, the University of
California-Santa Barbara and on Michigan public television with
hopes that they will air it.
   The PTV idea was spawned in 1987 when Casella, then a student at
Dartmouth College, won third place at the Poetry Film Festival in
San Francisco with a 25-minute black-and-white video of readings
from 16 companions.
   For PTV's theme, Casella borrowed a quote from author Kurt
Vonnegut, who once taught at the Iowa writers workshop: ``We're in
great trouble now that television can tell stories better than we
can.''
   Diana Beeson, campus channel program director, said PTV is ``one
of the most original concepts in programming I've seen in a long,
long time.''
   ``Poetry is a very intimate medium and so is television. This is
one of the things that makes PTV so engaging,'' she said.
   Casella sent a copy to the Arts and Entertainment network.
Brooke Bailey Johnson, vice president of programming and
production, wrote back that PTV was ``an interesting and
challenging concept'' but the network's schedule was set for
1989-90.
   Casella, who is already planning a sequel, said he is reluctant
to send the videotape to MTV because ``they'd edit the hell out of
it.''

<HEAD>Voters To Voice Opinion On Fate Of California Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voters who gave the troubled Rancho
Seco nuclear plant a reprieve last year decide next week whether
the utility passed its probation or should be shut down.
   Critics of ``the ranch,'' fearful of nuclear accidents and angry
at a $400 million repair cost and rising utility bills, want to
close the 15-year-old plant permanently. But supporters say the
plant's bad days are over since it has gotten new management.
   The managers of Rancho Seco acknowledge they face a difficult
task in convincing the public the plant can operate safely and
efficiently. ``The greatest challenge we face today is
perception,'' says Joseph Firlit, chief executive officer at Rancho
Seco.
   Residents of Sacramento County and parts of neighboring Placer
County will vote on the proposition Tuesday. Though the vote is not
binding on the municipal utility that owns Rancho Seco, a majority
of the utility's elected board members have said they will follow
the will of the people.
   The nuclear industry, fearful that closing one of the few
publicly owned plants in the nation could strengthen the hand of
critics of privately owned plants elsewhere, have raised $580,000
to push for its continued operation. Oppoenents have raised
$111,000, according to the latest campaign reports.
   Critics dismiss arguments that the plant has been transformed
since the 1985 overcooling accident that caused a 27-month outage.
``We've spent enough on Rancho Seco, and we've given it its
chance,'' says Peter Keat, one of the municipal utility board
members who favors the shutdown.
   Since its restart in April 1988, the plant has again been nagged
by a series of mechanical problems that has shut it down or forced
cutbacks in power production. Overall since restart, the plant has
run at about 47 percent of its operating capacity.
   Last June, shortly after the restart, voters narrowly granted
the plant a probationary period, allowing it to operate pending
another vote this year.
   Continuing problems show the plant has flunked probation, say
representatives of Campaign California, an environmental group
formed by Assemblyman Tom Hayden and his wife, Jane Fonda, that has
pushed for the plant's closing.
   Plant spokesmen Kerry Shearer, however, says the plant has won
praise from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for improvements
since the accident and that the restart last year was one of the
smoothest in the nuclear industry.
   Supporters also point to an offer from two companies involved
with creating Rancho Seco. Bechtel Power Corp. and Babcock &amp; Wilcox
are seeking a contract from the municipal utility district under
which they would share in management responsibilities and risk
losing part of their fees if the plant runs poorly.
   The campaign, at times, has strayed from the issues to items
such as the driving records of workers for the campaign to keep
Rancho Seco open and Hayden's protest against the Vietnam War 20
years ago.
   A poll, commissioned by The Sacramento Bee late last month,
indicated that 46.2 percent favored closing the plant, 36.5 percent
favored keeping it open, and 17.4 percent hadn't formed an opinion.
   The overcooling accident in December 1985 was the most serious
of the many problems that have plagued the 913-megawatt plant since
it was built at a cost of about $375 million. It opened in 1974.
   The plant's control room was rattled by a chorus of alarms as
operators futilely fought to halt a rapid temperature drop in the
nuclear reactor vessel.
   Federal investigators said a power outage to control room
instruments and employee errors allowed the steel vessel to cool
180 degrees in 24 minutes _ well beyond the 100-degrees-per-hour
limit designed to prevent cracking of the vessel and a leak of
cooling water that could trigger a reactor meltdown.
   The vessel did not crack, but two workers were exposed to a low
level of radiation and the plant vented a small amount of
radioactive steam into the air. The plant got new managers and
stayed shut for more than two years until the utility convinced the
NRC that it had sufficiently upgraded safety and employee training.
   But critics of Rancho Seco, calling it a costly and dangerous
liability, gathered enough signatures to put the measure on the
local June 1988 ballot to permanently shut the plant, which was
narrowly defeated.
   An alternate measure was put on the ballot by the utility's
governing board, calling for the probation period instead of an
outright shutdown. That measure narrowly passed, leading to the
vote next week.

<HEAD>Consultant, Ex-Navy Engineer Given 26-Month Prison Terms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Consultant William L. Parkin and the
former Navy engineer he bribed were given 26-month prison terms
Friday for illegally scheming to help two companies get lucrative
Pentagon contracts.
   Parkin, 65, and Stuart E. Berlin, 51, were each fined $25,000
and ordered to serve two years of supervised probation following
their release from prison. They each could have received up to 25
years in prison and fined $750,000.
   Berlin, who choked back sobs before U.S. District Judge Claude
Hilton imposed the sentence, said his crime was ``the worst mistake
that I ever made in my life.'' He added: ``The last year has been a
living hell for me.''
   The judge said both defendants, who have cooperated with the
Justice Department's ``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation of
Pentagon procurement fraud since pleading guilty, could serve their
time in minimum-security prisons.
   Parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Berlin to
provide secret Navy bid information that would help Teledyne
Industries Inc. and Hazeltine Corp. of Long Island, N.Y., obtain
lucrative contracts to sell electronic equipment to the Pentagon.
   Berlin, who admitted from the witness stand in April that he
took thousands of dollars in bribes while he worked for the Navy,
was sentenced for taking nearly $5,000 in bribes in return for
giving Parkin the bid information.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica acknowledged that both
men, who had testified at the trial of two Teledyne executives who
were convicted for their roles in the conspiracy, are cooperating
with the Justice Department's investigation.
   Aronica said Berlin's receipt of bribes ``is perhaps the most
serious offense that a government official can commit. It is a
violation of the public trust. It is a corruption that is motivated
by nothing more than his own greed.''
   Parkin's role ``as front man and the individual to whom money
was paid kept the conspiracy afloat,'' Aronica said. The prosecutor
said ``corrupting of a public official is reprehensible, especially
for a former government official.''
   Parkin, himself a former Navy employee, admitted that he had
taken $50,000 in bribes over a 10-year period when he worked for
the Defense Department.
   Court documents indicate that after opening a private consulting
business in 1983, Parkin became the center of a massive bribery
scheme involving efforts to trade and sell confidential Pentagon
information to help companies bid on contracts.
   Aronica told the judge that Parkin arranged to be paid $272,000
in consulting fees from Teledyne and Hazeltine that he agreed to
split with Berlin and others to obtain confidential bid information.
   Defense attorney Leonard Greenbaum urged the judge to take into
account that Berlin received less than his share of the bribe money
because he was ``shortchanged at the outset'' by Parkin and Fred
Lackner.
   Lackner, a Los Angeles defense consultant, is awaiting
sentencing for his role as go-between from Parkin to Berlin.
   ``What he got was less than $5,000,'' Greenbaum said.
   Parkin and Lackner agreed not to tell Berlin the full amount of
the money they were to split, thereby arranging to take larger
shares for themselves, according to their court testimony in April.
   Greenbaum also suggested that Berlin actually saved the
taxpayers money because the information he passed along to
Hazeltine prompted the company to lower its bid for a Navy
electronics contract by $70 million.
   Hazeltine, a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis,
and two of its officers pleaded guilty earlier this year to
participating in the conspiracy. The company paid nearly $2 million
in penalties.
   Teledyne, based in Newbury Park, Calif., also pleaded guilty,
agreeing to pay $4.3 million in penalties and forfeit $4 million in
future profits on a contract.
   Berlin, Parkin and Lackner were witnesses at the April trial at
which two Teledyne executives, George H. Kaub and Eugene R.
Sullivan, were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud. The two are
scheduled to be sentenced next Wednesday.

<HEAD>U.S. Businesswoman Pledges Up to $100 Million for Shipyard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Polish-American businesswoman has
pledged to invest up to $100 million in a deal that could rescue
the imperiled Lenin Shipyard, where Solidarity was born, a union
spokesman said Friday.
   Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson
pharmaceutical fortune, told shipyard officials and Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa on Thursday that she intended to form a joint
venture with the yard, said Piotr Konopka, Walesa's spokesman.
   The government announced six months ago that it planned to close
the yard because it was not profitable.
   But Walesa said the decision was politically motivated and
promised to find a way to save the yard, where Solidarity was
founded during a strike in 1980. The government said it would not
block a plan to restructure the yard if financial support could be
found.
   Under the joint venture, the yard would continue to build ships
with the goal of making a profit for Mrs. Piasecka-Johnson and the
shipyard, Konopka said.
   Mrs. Piasecka-Johnson said in a telephone interview that she was
``very pleased'' with the talks.
   ``I think it is a good time to invest in Poland,'' said Mrs.
Piasecka-Johnson, who lives near Princeton, N.J. ``The shipyard has
a great potential to produce wonderful ships and I thought it would
be a great thing to do. The shipyard workers are wonderful.''
   The partners would form an enterprise called the Gdansk Shipyard
Co. Ltd., in which she would hold 55 percent of the shares and the
shipyard 45 percent, Konopka said.
   He said the enterprise plans to obtain the necessary guarantees
to operate from the Polish finance minister and begin operating on
Jan. 1.
   Solidarity was formed in the shipyard after an 18-day strike.
Solidarity became the East bloc's first independent trade union.
   The government banned the union in a martial law crackdown in
December 1981. It was legalized again on April 5 as part of an
accord reached after the government and opposition held talks.

   A cancer-stricken boy who had been ordered into
a hospital over the objections of his parents was released back
into their custody today in an agrement under which he will be
taken to a cancer clinic in Texas.
   ``I pray God the youngster will be able to obtain such treatment
that is good for him,'' said Family Court Judge Leon Deutsch, who
announced the settlement. ``I pray God he will make a complete
recovery.''
   The boy, his mother and a lawyer for the city are to make the
trip Sunday to the M.D. Anderson institute at the University of
Texas in Houston.
   The agreement was reached with the city, the parents and the
judge, who on Thursday returned the 4-year-old boy to
Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, from which his father took
him in violation of a court order.
   The father, Steven Pagan, 36, surrendered with his son, Darian,
on Thursday after hearing that his wife, Migdalia, had been jailed
because of his action.
   Deutsch returned Darian to the custody of the city's Child
Welfare Administration and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
He ordered an examination of Darian but specifically prohibited
doctors at Sloan-Kettering from administering any treatment without
his consent.
   The dispute began when the parents objected to a planned
chemotherapy treatment, which could be painful.
   The judge imposed a 10-day suspended sentence against Pagan for
contempt of court and freed Mrs. Pagan, 35, who had spent the last
two nights in jail.
   ``Their feelings are confusion, relief and apprehension,'' said
the parents' lawyer, Steven Mandel. ``They still have a child with
leukemia and this is something no parent should have to go to
through.''
   Darian was hospitalized last Friday under an order from Deutsch
that was requested by the Child Welfare Administration because
hospital officials said the boy was not getting the treatment he
needed.
   The city became involved in the case after doctors from
Sloan-Kettering called them and said Darian was in imminent danger
if he did not receive a radical form of radiation and chemotherapy,
which the parents had resisted.
   The Pagans, who live in Brooklyn, are Jehovah's Witnesses, a
religion that opposes blood transfusions. But Mandel said their
religion did not play a part in the court case.

<HEAD>Paper Reveals 1962 Troop Massacre of Strikers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official newspaper exposed Friday the
27-year-old secret of how soldiers killed a score of strikers in a
blaze of gunfire, secretly buried them and hid their bloodstains
under a thick coat of cement.
   Recollections published by the youth newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda marked the anniversary of the 1962 strike over food
shortages in the southern city of Novocherkassk, and for the first
time officially confirmed rumors circulating for decades.
   ``I heard the massive fire of submachine guns ... as a result of
the use of firearms, 22 or 24 people were killed, including a boy
of school age,'' recalled the region's former assistant military
commander, retired Lt. Gen. Matvey K. Shaposhnikov. ``Thirty people
were wounded.''
   ``The next morning I found out that the dead were secretly
buried,'' he said. Shaposhnikov said he opposed the action and was
kicked out of the Communist Party in 1968 for trying to expose it.
   A. Simonov, a teacher, told the paper that after the massacre,
``they tried to wash the blood from the square for a long time,
first with fire engines, then other ways, with brushes, and at last
called in a steamroller and laid a thick layer of pavement.''
   Soviet officials long denied Soviet dissidents' and Western
sources' reports of the massacre and their charges that at least 70
people were killed.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda displayed the story over half its back page
with commentary from three legislators saying it is fitting to
report on the bloodshed as the newly elected Congress of People's
Deputies meets.
   The inaugural session of the first competitively elected Soviet
Congress has included unprecedented criticism of the Communist
Party and government and forced open discussion of such issues as
the 1940 seizure of the Baltic republics and recent ethnic violence
in the Caucasus republics.
   In contrast to the secrecy surrounding the Novocherkassk
killings, a national outcry followed the military's violent
dispersal of pro-independence protesters in Tbilisi, Georgia, in
April, where 20 people were killed.
   Long lines for food and protests of official mismanagement
caused the Novocherkassk strike, the paper said.
   ``Lines at the stores for meat and oil grew before your eyes,''
it said.
   ``But the more alarming the situation became, the louder sounded
the fanfare, promises of rapid success and the rapid approach of
communism.''
   Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader at the time, denounced
Stalinism and eased his pervasive repression while promising rapid
economic progress.
   Instead, workers were faced with poor living conditions,
relatively high rents and nothing to buy in the stores.
   Finally, they struck at the Budenny locomotive factory. The
regional Communist Party chief, identified in the paper only as
Basov, arrived to calm them but ended up complaining to a meeting
about how difficult his life was, recalled factory engineer S.
Yelkin.
   ``Hooligans began throwing bottles at him, and we decided to get
Basov out of there. We helped him slip out of a window and into a
car.''
   Strike organizers were arrested the next morning, but other
factories went on strike, and the military was deployed with tanks
and armored personnel carriers.
   At the same time, Shaposhnikov recalled, thousands of people
waving red banners began marching in the city center. They were
halted and scattered by gunfire from soldiers.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said two senior Moscow officials, Anastas
Mikoyan and F.R. Kozol, were dispatched to Novocherkassk and
organized the Aug. 14 trial of the most active strike organizers.
   ``Seven people were sentenced to be shot,'' the newspaper said.
   ``A review of those criminal cases _ a careful, impassionate and
just analysis of them _ is our obligation to the truth,'' it
concluded.

   Unemployment fell slightly to 5.2 percent last
month but job growth sputtered to a three-year low, the government
said Friday in a report laden with evidence of economic slowdown.
   The Labor Department said civilian joblessness fell from April's
rate of 5.3 percent, with a decline in the number of people looking
for work offsetting an anemic expansion of non-farm payrolls.
   Financial markets reacted favorably to the report, which
immediately renewed speculation among economists over whether the
Federal Reserve is ready to relax its tight hold on credit in the
face of a slowing economy.
   ``Are they going to ease on the basis of this report alone? No,
I don't think so,'' said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the
Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Fed governor.
   Only 101,000 new jobs were added to the economy last month, the
lowest monthly total since 84,000 in March 1986 and well below the
average monthly gain of 275,000 jobs for 1987 and 1988. The average
month-to-month gain over the last three months has slipped to
160,000.
   ``It suggests to us that we're going to have either slow growth
or no growth in the second half of the year,'' said Merrill Lynch
chief economist Donald H. Straszheim. ``This slowdown is not a
statistical fluke _ it is an event.''
   ``This is a rather weak report on employment but I don't see any
indications of recession,'' said Gramley.
   ``The economy certainly does not appear to be headed near-term
for a recession,'' said Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers
Inc.
   There was a bit of good news on inflation as average hourly
earnings increased just 0.1 percent last month on a seasonally
adjusted basis after shooting up more than 0.6 percent from March
to April.
   But coming on the heels of a report showing first-quarter unit
labor costs rose 6.6 percent on an annual basis, analysts said the
encouraging wage data in the unemployment report was not enough
evidence to say inflation was waning.
   The slowdown in payroll expansion was essentially across the
board, with declines in the goods-producing industries and gains on
the service-producing side well below robust 1987 and 1988 averages.
   Construction payrolls fell by 14,000 and manufacturing jobs by
18,000, according to the Labor Department's survey of business
establishments. Overall, the goods-producing sector lost 33,000
jobs last month.
   Growth in the service-producing sector offset some of those
losses but was sluggish nonetheless, including the slowest
month-to-month gain in service jobs _ 65,000 _ in six years.
   Wholesale trade added just 2,000 jobs last month and retail
trade 17,000, while governments expanded their payrolls by 32,000
workers, the government said.
   The Labor Department said the average private-sector
nonagricultural workweek fell 0.3 hours, to 34.6 hours. The average
factory workweek also fell last month, slipping 0.2 hours to 41
hours while average overtime fell an equal amount to 3.8 hours.
   Those could be further signs of slowing growth, but the Labor
Department cautioned that they also could reflect adjustments from
April, when the data was skewered somewhat because formulas for
seasonal influences did not take into account that Easter holidays
fell in March this year instead of April.
   The unemployment rate declined despite such sluggish job growth
because, the government said, there were 49,000 fewer people in the
civilian labor force last month. The number of unemployed Americans
who were actively seeking jobs fell 151,000 to 6.39 million last
month.
   The government said the number of part-time workers last month
who wanted to work full time fell by about 300,000, to 4.8 million.
   Declines in the unemployment rate were reported for both white
and black adult men while joblessness soared among black women and
black teen-agers.
   Unemployment among white adult men fell from 4 percent to 3.6
percent in May while the rate dropped among black men from 10
percent to 9.4 percent.
   For white women, the unemployment rate last month was unchanged
at 4.1 percent while for black women it shot up from 8.8 percent to
9.5 percent.
   Unemployment for black teen-agersclimbed from 26.2 percent to
28.4 percent. The rate among white teen-agers was 11.2 percent,
down from 11.5 percent.
   Among Hispanics, unemployment dropped from 8.3 percent to 7.9
percent, said the government, which does not provide a gender or
age breakdown for Hispanics.
   A separate calculation that includes military personnel
stationed in the United States put May unemployment at 5.1 percent,
down from 5.2 percent.
   The report included a number of revisions to previous data
because of several annual steps the department takes in an effort
to increase the accuracy of its surveys. Those changes included a
reduction of 595,000 in the government's estimate of job growth in
the last two years.

<TEXT>
   A member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee on Friday suggested reducing U.S. forces stationed in
South Korea and requiring the Japanese to foot the full bill for
keeping American troops in Japan.
   ``The United States can no longer sustain a disproportionate
burden of maintaining a common defense for the free world,'' said
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. He is chairman of the Armed Services
subcommittee on conventional forces and alliance defense.
   In an interview with reporters, Levin also proposed deferring
the funds for construction of a new base in Crotone, Italy, to
house the 401st Tactical Wing.
   Last year, the United States accepted Spain's demands that the
Air Force withdraw its 72 F-16 jet fighter bombers, approximately
3,600 troops and 600 civilians from Torrejon de Ardoz, just east of
Madrid.
   Italy has agreed to provide a new home for the wing at a cost
for the NATO allies of about $830 million. The United States is
expected to pay about $26 million.
   ``It makes pure common sense to defer the authorization and
appropriation for a new base when it may turn out those troops are
going to be gone from Europe altogether,'' Levin said referring to
President Bush's proposal this week to cut NATO and Warsaw Pact
forces.
   During the 40th anniversary meeting of the alliance, Bush
proposed a ceiling of 275,000 on U.S. and Soviet ground and air
force personnel, which would require a reduction of about 30,000
U.S. troops and about 325,000 Soviet troops.
   Levin said he will make his proposals in the form of a ``sense
of the Senate'' resolution which reflects the Senate's sentiment
but has no legal authority.
   Specifically, Levin is proposing that the Bush administration
discuss with South Korea a timetable ``for a mutually acceptable
... partial reduction of our forces'' and a plan to replace the
U.S. commander who has operational control over Korean forces with
a South Korean general.
   The Michigan Democrat estimated that the more than 40,000 U.S.
troops could be reduced to about 10,000.
   Levin also suggested that Japan pay the total cost for
stationing U.S. troops there and pick up part of the tab for basing
troops elsewhere in Asia. Currently, Japan pays for between 60 and
70 percent of the total cost, or about $2.5 billion, Levin said.

<TEXT>
   Gourmet ice cream king Joey Crugnale didn't see
any future in chopped ham and pickle sandwiches.
   Old women called up and implored him to reconsider. After a
wearying morning of shopping, they wanted to come in to Bailey's,
peel off their white gloves and have a dainty sandwich or a hot
fudge sundae _ as they always had done.
   But Crugnale had made a fortune with a yuppie, trendy, gourmet
ice cream chain called Steve's (named for a chap Crugnale had
bought out) and had begun a yuppie, trendy, gourmet pizza chain
called Bertucci's.
   So he decided to ignore his older customers and apply the trendy
formula to Bailey's, a 116-year-old chain of candy and ice cream
stores that had invented the hot fudge sundae, reportedly kept
files on the preferences of prominent customers, and supplied
chocolates to three U.S. presidents.
   It didn't work, as a sadder-but-wiser Crugnale himself admits.
Now, the chain's new owners, who bought him out last fall, are
trying to bring it back.
   While he was owner in 1987 and 1988, Crugnale eliminated the
traditional sandwiches _ chopped ham and pickles, peanut butter and
bacon, datenut bread and cream cheese. He made the stores brighter,
airier, more modern, instead of dark and cool with mahogany and
marble. He fired many longtime employees.
   ``Joey Crugnale, he didn't like old things, so he just threw
them out,'' said Frank Wyman Jr., a former Bailey's owner.
   Crugnale bought the seven stores and a candy factory in January
1987 for a reported $1.5 million. When he sold it 20 months later
for an undisclosed price, it was down to two stores, both in the
suburbs.
   ``I think the company lost its focus and it became more of a
luncheon stop as opposed to an old-fashioned candy store and ice
cream parlor,'' said one of the new owners, Michael Mazzaferro.
``We want to restore it to its roots.''
   While they are not ready for rapid expansion, Mazzaferro and his
two brothers, whose family has been in the candy business for
decades, said they hope soon to reopen stores in Boston and
Cambridge, perhaps through franchising.
   Bailey's dates to the 1870s, but its most famous history was
written in this century. Sarah Dow, bookkeeper for founder John
Bailey, took over his shop in 1900 when he retired and is credited
with inventing the hot fudge sundae.
   ``She put 6 ounces of ice cream in a five-ounce dish and poured
1{ ounces of hot fudge on top of it, and it dripped down onto the
silver dish,'' Wyman said with reverence. ``Beautiful concept.
Beautiful product.''
   Later, Bailey's supplied mail-order chocolates to Theodore
Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge and John F. Kennedy. Joe Kennedy, the
late president's father, was one of those who kept his candy
preferences on record at the flagship store at the edge of the
Boston Common, which had lost its lease and gone out of existence
before Crugnale bought the chain.
   Crugnale, 37, who built Steve's Ice Cream from one store to a
chain of 26 before selling out in 1983, says his experience before
he bought Bailey's made him overconfident.
   ``I thought I was superman _ I did Steve's, I could do
anything,'' he said.
   Though humbled by his failure with Bailey's, Crugnale has
bounced back by expanding Bertucci's into a chain of 12 pizzerias
in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
   Bailey's ``was a mistake from the beginning,'' he said. ``But
I'm not ashamed of it. I learned a lot from it.''

<HEAD>Microfilm of Secret Nazi-Soviet Protocols Exists, Officials Say</HEAD>

   A microfilm of secret protocols
detailing how Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union colluded to seize
Poland and the Baltic states has survived and is in West German
archives, officials said Friday.
   Information Minister Hans Klein told reporters the film has been
inspected by two Soviet historians investigating the Soviet Union's
1940 annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
   Foreign Ministry officials said the Nazis destroyed documents
deeding the Baltic nations to the Soviet Union but that an
unidentified diplomat saved a copy on microfilm.
   On Thursday, the new Soviet Congress approved a Kremlin inquiry
into the non-aggression pact that paved the way for the takeover of
the independent Baltic states and the Nazi invasion of Poland.
   Independent groups challenging Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to prove the sincerity of his reforms are pressing the
Kremlin to admit it has been lying for more than 40 years with its
claims that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania willingly joined the
Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev himself requested Bonn's help last fall when he met
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and asked if the West Germans had a
copy of the secret protocols.
   Klein told reporters Friday the original pact signed Aug. 23,
1939 by the wartime foreign ministers, Vyacheslav Molotov and
Joachim von Ribbentrop, remains in Bonn's Foreign Ministry archives.
   But the secret protocols detailing the Baltic takeover and
Polish invasion were destroyed by Nazi officials in the last days
of World War II, Klein said.
   ``However, a microfilm copy of this and other documents was
preserved by a diplomat,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen
Chrobog said.
   The officials said they do not know who preserved the microfilm
or why.
   ``It's not just presumable, we believe that it is authentic,''
Klein said. ``I cannot imagine how or why anyone at that time would
reproduce the documents and then make a microfilm of them.''
   Klein said two Soviet historians traveled to Bonn a few weeks
ago to examine the documents, which include a map showing the
territories divided between the two nations.
   Chrobog declined to detail the statements included in the secret
protocols.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said in Moscow in August that the Kremlin has no copy of the
protocols.
   The so-called Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement has come under close
scrutiny over the past year as Soviet reforms have allowed open
discussion.
   It freed German troops to attack Poland in September 1939. The
Germans agreed not to defend the Baltics, to which they were
closely allied, leaving the Soviets to seize eastern Poland, attack
Finland and then take the Baltic states in July 1940.

   Members of the Washington apple industry
applauded the decision by Uniroyal Chemical Co. to voluntarily
withdraw Alar from food use.
   The Middlebury, Conn., company announced Friday in Washington,
D.C., that it would immediately remove the farm chemical labeled as
a possible carcinogen until final test data is reviewed by the
Environmental Protection Agency and a final regulatory decision is
reached.
   ``They are darn late in getting to this point,'' said John
McAlister of Tree Top Inc., the nation's largest apple juice maker.
``We've been after them for a long time and consumer confidence has
been affected.''
   ``We should be hopeful and expect this will be the beginning of
restoring consumer confidence,'' said McAlister, whose company has
suffered a sales drop of more than 20 percent since the Alar
controversy began in February.
   Ironically, a strong stand against Alar use was reportedly a
major factor in the forced resignation of Tree Top president Dennis
Colleran earlier this week. Colleran called for a ban on Alar,
apparently angering some of the juice cooperative's growers who
supported use of the growth regulator that enhances the appearance
of apples.
   Sales of supermarket apples also have slumped dramatically,
costing growers an estimated $100 million nationwide this year.
   ``It won't make any difference for this year, but it certainly
should help us as far as sales for next year's crop is concerned,''
said Bill DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association, which
charts apple sales.
   DeWitt reported Friday that out-of-state apple shipments for the
week ending Thursday were down 22 percent from the week before.
   But he said that was primarily due to a short work week caused
by the Memorial Day holiday.
   Shipments totaled 863,000 42-pound boxes, down from 1.1 million
the week before. During the same week last year shipments totaled
964,000 boxes.
   Of much greater concern to growers are the 12 million boxes left
in storage, including an unknown number of Alar-treated apples that
retailers do not want.
   The inventory is 3.3 million boxes above last year at this time.
   Alar, the marketing name for daminozide, was labeled a possible
carcinogen by the private Natural Resources Defense Council in a
February report. The findings have been disputed by Uniroyal, and
the federal government has pronounced apples safe to eat for the
time being.
   The EPA was one of the agencies involved in pronouncing apples
safe, but in a separate action it said it plans to ban Alar next
year, although pending tests could affect that decision.

<HEAD>Lukens Plans to Stay in Congress While He Appeals Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, rebuffing calls
for his resignation, announced Friday that he intends to stay in
Congress while he fights to overturn his conviction of having sex
with a 16-year-old girl.
   ``I refuse to allow the lies and deceit of one delinquent
individual to ruin me. I am now fighting for my life,'' the Ohio
Republican said in a statement released by his office.
   Lukens, 58 and divorced, was convicted May 26 of contributing to
the delinquency and unruliness of a minor, a misdemeanor. The
Franklin County, Ohio, jury found him guilty of having sex with the
girl at his Columbus apartment last November.
   Lukens said in his statement that his accuser had ``fantasies of
`getting even with the establishment.'''
   But the court refused to allow him to bring up evidence he
wanted to present to raise doubts about her reliability, the
conservative lawmaker said.
   ``My legal counselors assure me that prospects for a reversal in
my case are excellent,'' he said. ``Only at that time will I make
my final decision regarding any future political activity,'' he
said.
   Vowing to prove his innocence, he declared: ``I am not a
quitter.''
   Lukens' statement made no mention of a report Thursday by a
Columbus television station that another teen-age girl said she
also had sex with Lukens, in 1985 when she was 15. The station said
Lukens paid the girl for sex on five or six occasions.
   WSYX-TV said the girl, identified only as ``Paris,'' had been
sought by the grand jury to testify in Lukens' case but was not
found. Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller told The
Associated Press that the girl had refused to cooperate with the
original investigation, and he did not plan to reopen it.
   Conviction on the misdemeanor charge does not automatically
preclude Lukens from serving in the House or seeking re-election.
   However, Ohio state GOP chairman Robert Bennett said Lukens will
not be on the party's ticket in 1990. He said he informed Lukens'
office on Thursday night, and spoke with Lukens and party officials
from his western Ohio district before making that decision.
   ``I think he is a bad apple for the Republican Party,'' Bennett
said. ``He has lost the support of the entire Republican leadership
of his district.''
   Don Birgel, chairman of the Butler County GOP in Lukens'
district, said Lukens should resign because ``a party is known by
the leaders it keeps.''
   His case has come amid the current ethics storm on Capitol Hill
and some Republicans, who have been using the ethics issue to beat
up on Democrats, have expressed concern privately that his staying
could hurt their efforts.
   House Republicans currently have no announced plans for taking
up the matter in their conference, nor has the House ethics
committee announced an investigation.
   Lukens is currently in the second term of his second stint in
Congress. He also was in Congress for two terms from 1967 to 1971.

   Tens of thousands of troops marched toward
Tiananmen Square early Saturday in an apparent move against
pro-democracy students, but the soldiers were pushed back by
protesters who blocked the road.
   The troops advCommittee,
originally thought to be in late May or early June, has been
postponed, apparently because Deng has not marshalled his forces to
carry out a public purge of his rivals.
   About 400 students from universities in Nanjing began walking
the 1,000 miles to Beijing on Friday to add their support to the
pro-democracy movement. An American student in Nanjing said the
Chinese were inspired by the U.S. civil rights movement and its
marches on Selma, Ala., and Washington.

   Soviet fireboats have been trying for four days to
put out a fire on a Caspian Sea oil platform, which was rocked by a
series of explosions that sent flames 80 feet into the air, Pravda
reported Friday.
   A fireboat rescued all 24 workers aboard the deep-water platform
when it exploded about 100 miles from Baku, the capital of the
southwestern republic of Azerbaijan, the newspaper said.
   Part of the metal structure fell into the sea after the second
of three blasts on the No. 2 platform in the oil field called
``April 28,'' Pravda said.
   A storm that whipped up 30-foot waves and winds up to 65 mph
made firefighting especially dangerous for boats and helicopters
trying to save the men and equipment, the newspaper reported.
   It did not say when the fire started.
   On Friday, four fireboats and 28 water guns still were battling
the blaze on the platform, which normally produces thousands of
tons of oil a day, Pravda said.

<HEAD>Senate Hopes to Finish Domestic Spending Bill Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate set its sights Friday on finishing
a $3.3 billion ``dire emergency'' spending bill next week after the
legislation bogged down under a load of amendments.
   In about three hours Friday, lawmakers worked their way through
several non-controversial amendments, ranging from resuming food
aid to Haiti to financing University of Wyoming research of last
summer's fires at Yellowstone National Park. The session followed a
nearly 14-hour day Thursday.
   The Senate then recessed until Tuesday, when it will consider
several proposals likely to spark lengthy debate. They include
provisions delaying the start of catastrophic care programs for the
elderly and repealing a tax law regulating employee benefit
programs.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
has shown impatience with the pace of work on the bill. After
another senator thanked colleagues for coming to the floor for
debate, Byrd responded, ``That's where we ought to be. We're
getting paid for it.''
   The so-called dire emergency spending bill, first requested by
President Bush in March, is designed to finance agencies running
low on funds for fiscal 1989's final four months.
   It includes $1.2 billion for cost-of-living benefit increases
and health care for veterans, $892 million for loans for college
students, and money for foster care, food stamps, the expenses of
fighting last year's Western forest fires and other programs.
   But as routinely happens with spending measures, the legislation
has attracted provisions that has little to do with programs
running out of money and much to do with lawmakers seeing a chance
to help their states or favorite causes.
   Thus, the Senate approved a provision Friday urging the
Agriculture Department to buy more apples to help an industry hurt
by findings that alar, a growth enhancer sprayed on the fruit, can
cause cancer. The measure was sponsored by Sens. Brock Adams,
D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who represent one of the
country's top apple growers.
   An amendment by Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., was adopted
directing the spending of $800,000 for the study of last summer's
Yellowstone fires, some of which would be conducted by the
University of Wyoming.
   Also approved was a provision by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
permitting up to $12 million worth of U.S. food aid to go to Haiti.
Most assistance to that country has been halted because of human
rights abuses there, but Graham said improvements have been made.

   Immigration officials are shaving
the heads of illegal immigrants from Indonesia before they are
deported so they can be identified if they return immediately, a

   There are about 1 million illegal immigrants from Indonesia
working on plantations and construction sites in Malaysia,
according to the government. Immigration officials arrest and
deport many of the Indonesians, but many return within a few days.
   The New Straits Times daily on Friday quoted the Immigration

   The first group, 30 men, was deported by boat from Batu Pahat on

<HEAD>Creating Independent Status Compared To Separate Siamese Twins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group backing independent status for Puerto
Rico told a Senate panel Friday that changing the island's nearly
100-year-old relationship with the United States will be as
delicate a procedure as major surgery.
   ``I have sometimes compared this process to two Siamese twins.
... You just can't pull the machete and cut them apart. You have to
do very careful surgery which is what we are trying to do,'' said
Ruben Berrios Martinez, president of the Puerto Rican Independence
Party.
   ``That's why we refer to it as a transitory state,'' said
Berrios, who was testifying for the second day before the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is considering
legislation to provide the mechanism for a referendum allowing
Puerto Rico's voters to decide the territory's future political and
economic status.
   The panel also heard testimoney from Carlos Romero Barcelo,
president of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party and
Commonwealth Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon.
   The United States gained sovereignty over the island in 1898
after the Spanish-American War, and it became a U.S. commonwealth
in 1952. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who pay no U.S. taxes and
cannot vote for president, but are eligible for military service.
The island gets about $6 billion in aid from the federal government
annually.
   The island's three major political parties have proposed
maintaining its current status as a U.S. commonwealth territory
with ``enhanced'' authority, becoming the nation's 51st state or
establishing an independent republic.
   Should the referendum results favor independence, the PRIP has
proposed that a joint transition commission composed of
representatives from the U.S. government and an independent Puerto
Rico manage the orderly transfer of power.
   ``It seems to me that the transition should be a Puerto Rican
affair,'' said D. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate
panel.
   However, both Johnston and the committee's ranking Republican,
James McClure of Idaho, insisted that details on matters including
citizenship, migration, taxation, judicial jurisdiction of ongoing
cases and election challenges, defense, trade, currency, finance
and public debt must be worked out in advance of a proclamation of
independence and subsequent constitutional convention proposed by
the PRIP.
   ``It is inconsistent with independence to have dual
citizenship,'' said Johnston in response to another PRIP proposal.
   Fernando Martin, vice president of the independence party said
such questions were very important political issues that
congressional and party staffs would have to iron out to be
included in any legislation on Puerto Rico's status.
   McClure said he was concerned that U.S. military and security
interests were guaranteed in any independence arrangement.
   ``Under independence your government could change. ... We have
to find a way in which we can make foreign military power denial a
permanent part of any plan,'' he said.
   ``We ought to guarantee Roosevelt Roads for a period,'' added
Johnston.
   The Roosevelt Roads Naval Base on Puerto Rico is the largest in
acreage in the world outside the continental United States.
   The Energy panel plans three days of public hearings on the
island later this month to further fine tune its referendum
legislation, but Johnston said Thursday at least four other
committees in the Senate would have jurisdiction over various
sections of any final bill.

to replace an infected heart valve.
   Clark, whose patrols of Eastside High School in Paterson earned

   A galaxy of rock stars attended the video
premiere of a new song intended to spark public outrage over the
destruction of the Earth's rain forests.
   Thursday night's preview audience of rock stars, diplomats, and
U.N. officials _ including participating artists Olivia
Newton-John, Thomas Dolby, and Taylor Dayne _ saw the five-minute
video of ``Spirit of the Forest,'' and heard several speakers
stress the importance of awakening the public to the crisis lurking
behind the elimination of the rain forests.
   ``At this very moment, thousands of trees are being cut,'' said
Paulo Rivera, a resident of Brazil's rain forest.
   ``Spirit of the Forest'' which will be released Monday, features
a Brazilian-punctuated rock beat.
   The British band Gentlemen Without Weapons conceived the project
and wrote and produced the song, which is in the tradition of the
African hunger relief anthem ``We Are the World.''
   As in that video, the camera pans over a chorus of stars,
including Joni Mitchell, Deborah Harry, Iggy Pop, Belinda Carlisle,
Donna Summer, Ringo Starr, and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.
   All proceeds from the record will be donated to organizations
dedicated to saving the world's rain forests, according to Richard
Brandstad of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Records Inc. which is
marketing and distributing the record.

   Actor Paul Newman has beaten a $41,000 tax
bite on income from ``The Sting.''
   Newman won the tax dispute when the California Supreme Court
rejected the state's claim for a greater portion of Newman's income
from the movie.
   Newman's case involved a dispute over the definition of working
days. While filming ``The Sting,'' Newman spent 30 days in
California in 1973, 25 of them filming and five ``on call,'' and 24
days outside California, only two of them filming.
   In their tax returns, Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward,
described 54 days as ``working days'' and apportioned 30, or 55.5
percent, to California. But the tax board said only the 27 days of
actual filming should count as ``working days,'' and 25 of them, or
92.6 percent, were attributed to California.
   Justice Jack Goertzen said in the decision that Newman was
required to report for work by his studio at any time during the
period he was ``on call,'' and could not take any conflicting jobs.

   His catchy televised campaign video makes
fun of his ears and calls them ``disquieting.''
   It's not your typical political message, but former government
spokesman Jerzy Urban _ a man Poles love to hate _ is carrying out
his fight for a parliament seat with his trademark style of
combining irreverence, self-mockery and sarcasm.
   The point man for seven years in the government's propaganda
campaign against the Solidarity trade union, Urban was among the
first Polish officials to announce his candidacy in Sunday's
elections for parliament and the new Senate.
   Despite eight years of loyal service to the communist
authorities, justifying martial law, and belittling Lech Walesa as
``the former head of a former union,'' Urban _ now information
minister _ is running as an independent.
   It is the kind of provocative behavior that irritates much of
Poland's population but keeps people tuned in to see what he will
do next.
   Facing Urban for the Warsaw seat is popular actor Andrzej
Lapicki, who has received Solidarity's endorsement. The opposition
says its polls show Lapicki ahead by 7-to-1.
   But the outcome could be much different because of the large
number of ballots expected to be cast by Poles abroad, whose votes
all are counted in the district.
   There are about 140,000 eligible voters in the district itself
and some 600,000 abroad. Many may feel compelled to vote the
government way because they work in embassies or as contract
workers in communist or Middle Eastern countries.
   Poles got to know Urban when, as the government's spokesman, he
conducted weekly news conferences that were televised nationwide.
He was promoted to head state television and radio the day
Solidarity became legal again, April 17.
   In the early days of his campaign, Urban used coupons in
official newspapers to collect the requisite 3,000 nominating
signatures, angering the opposition. He also managed to get letters
printed and inserted into most mailboxes in his district.
   His distinctive appearance makes him easily identifiable.
   He is a small, round man with a perfectly circular bald pate and
distinctively large ears. A humorous music video on Urban that
appeared on state TV _ which Urban controls _ delighted in calling
attention to his ears.
   As a popular singer sang refrains of, ``Strange ears had he,
strange hears had he,'' viewers could see Urban as a child,
teen-ager and young man; circles drawn around his ears on the
photographs made them look even larger.
   ``Everyone knows who I am,'' Urban said at a campaign meeting
with students.
   The first few editions of the new opposition newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza contained so many articles concerning Urban that one
letter writer opposed to Urban felt compelled to remind editors to
avoid ``Urbanophobia.''
   A longtime journalist and satirist who was associated with Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski's liberal party weekly Polityka, Urban
became government spokesman in 1981. He gave his first news
conference the day martial law was imposed in December of that year.
   As government spokesman, Urban frequently cited polling data
showing more than half the population disapproved of him but that
his news conferences were the highest rated weekly show on
television.
   Ryszard Straus, a longtime aide in the government spokesman's
office, said Urban believes polls showing him behind are
exaggerated.
   In a country where many of the rulers are gray and humorless,
Urban stands out. Some argue that he is provocative to draw public
ire that otherwise might be directed at others.

   The Recruit scandal scuttled many careers and
toppled a government, but authorities said Friday that the man
first investigated for alleged participation will not face charges.
   The Yokohama District prosecutor's office announced it will not
indict Hideki Komatsu, former deputy mayor of Kawasaki, on bribery
charges, Kyodo News Service and television reports said.
   Officials could not be reached for comment Friday evening.
Komatsu, who was fired as deputy mayor two days after the Asahi
published its story, also could not be reached.
   The Recruit scandal emerged last summer when the Asahi Shimbun
newspaper reported that Komatsu allegedly had bought stocks in a
real estate firm before they were offered publicly and sold them at
a huge profit after they were listed.
   Reporters were tipped off by police who said they were
investigating Komatsu.
   He was sold stock in Recruit Cosmos, a subsidiary of the
conglomerate Recruit Co., apparently to sweeten a land deal in
Kawasaki, just south of Tokyo.
   In the following months, Recruit Co. helped about 160
influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen to make such
lucrative deals. Prosecutors have charged 17 people with bribery or
violating laws on securities or political donations.
   Friday evening news programs, after reporting Sousuke Uno's
election as prime minister to replace Noboru Takeshita's
scandal-tained government, showed an official of the Yokohama
prosecutor's office saying Komatsu would not be indicted.
   The official said Komatsu accepted the stock but that the act
fell short of bribery because Komatsu could not have anticipated
that the shares' price would rise so dramatically.

   Mozambican rebels claimed Friday that
Zimbabwean warplanes bombed rebel-held territory in western
Mozambique and killed 129 civilians.
   No immediate comment was available from Zimbabwe, which like
Tanzania has troops helping President Joaquim Chissano's Marxist
government fight the right-wing Mozambique National Resistance.
   A rebel statement distributed in Lisbon, Portugal, said the May
21 and 30 attacks in Tete, Manica and Gaza provinces are an attempt
to force civilians to seek refuge in government-controlled areas.
   Soviet-built MiG-21 jet fighters and Mi-8 helicopters were used
in the attack, the rebels said.
   The Mozambique National Resistance regularly denies accusations
that its guerrillas commit widespread atrocities against civilians
in the hit-and-run insurgency they have waged since 1977, after
Portugal gave Mozambique its independence.
   South Africa denies it is continuing aid for the rebels despite
signing a non-aggression pact with Mozambique in 1984.

   Critics have dismissed it as ``trash TV,'' ``TV
tabloid journalism,'' or media-inspired vigilantism.
   But because of ``America's Most Wanted,'' a suspect in the
drug-related torture-slaying of 12 persons in Mexico was nabbed in
Arizona in April. Last month, an escapee from a California jail
charged with jewel theft and kidnapping was caught in Rapid City,
S.D.
   And this week, an 18-year search for John E. List, wanted in
connection with the shooting deaths of his mother, wife and three
children in Westfield, N.J., ended in Richmond, Va., after the case
was featured on the Fox television program on May 21 and prompted
some 300 phoned-in tips.
   This ratings mainstay of the fledgling Fox network has turned 22
million Sunday viewers into bloodhounds, responding to televised
mug shots and dramatized re-enactments of crimes with up to 5,000
phoned-in tips every week.
   Since ``America's Most Wanted'' first aired 15 months ago, 79 of
the 154 fugitives profiled have been captured, and 48 were the
direct result of viewer tips, said Michael Linder, the program's
executive producer.
   TV fare like this is a long way from ``The Ed Sullivan Show,''
the Sunday sine qua non of a generation ago. After 67 episodes,
``America's Most Wanted'' has attracted both strong supporters and
detractors.
   Citing the program's success in drawing attention to fugitives,
Los Angeles County officials last February began circulating
descriptions and photographs of wanted criminals among all county
employees.
   The FBI, despite initial skepticism, is now a firm supporter of
the TV program and has cooperated with producers on a number of
cases, including the List case.
   ``The FBI has told us that there is no way to estimate the
number of Americans alive today because of `America's Most
Wanted,''' said Linder in an interview.
   ``There is a benefit that goes beyond simply arresting
fugitives. These are among the nation's most violent criminals.
Capturing them means prevention of murders and other serious
crimes,'' he said.
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police, in Arlington,
Va., gave ``America's Most Wanted'' an ``excellence in media''
award last October.
   But the American Civil Liberties Union has raised questions
about the program's fairness.
   ``Our worry is that the program portrays the actual crime prior
to an indictment or conviction in a way that suggests guilt,'' said
Colleen O'Connor, national director of public education. ``It has
the effect of validating the accusation. That could preempt the
right to a fair trial in some cases.''
   ``It would be one thing if the show only functioned like an
electronic post office billboard,'' she said. ``But it's quite
another if the content of a program describes something as true
that could be debatable.''
   Linder said his show has not proven prejudicial to criminal
defendants.
   ``In every case that has gone to court, local prosecutors and
lawyers have been able to agree on juries that hadn't see
`America's Most Wanted,''' he said.
   Others have questioned whether the program leads to neighbors
snitching on neighbors, causing authorities to harass innocent
persons.
   Replied Linder: ``We tell our viewers they can call anonymously.
But fully 65 percent are willing to leave their numbers for
followup by law enforcement investigators. People are not using
this show to bother their neighbors.''

<TEXT>
   Gunmen tied up 17 Sinhalese and shot
them to death in a series of attacks nationwide that appeared to be
orchestrated, military officials said Friday.
   The bodies of eight young men, their hands tied behind their
backs, were found Thursday by workers at a plantation in the
central Sri Lankan city of Beragala, the officials said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Beragala is 45 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Four bodies were found Thursday in the southern town of Matara,
72 miles south of Colombo, and five bodies were found in Kurunegala
district, 36 miles northeast of the capital, they said.
   They said all the men were killed in similar fashion but did not
give details.
   Independent sources said the executions were carried out by
pro-government vigilante groups that previously killed members of
an anti-government Sinhalese extremist organization. The sources
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The ultranationalist Sinhalese militants are opposed to the
government's peace overtures to Tamil rebels who are fighting to
set up an independent nation in the country's northern and eastern
areas.
   Meanwhile, police in Colombo fired tear gas shells Friday to
stop about 500 Moslem demonstrators from marching to the Indian
High Commission, or embassy.
   The marchers were protesting the alleged inaction of Indian
peacekeeping troops during clashes between Moslems and Tamil
militants in eastern Sri Lanka last month. At least 12 people died
in the clashes.
   The peacekeeping troops are stationed in the northern and
eastern regions to enforce law and order under the terms of an
India-brokered peace accord of July 1987 that aimed to end the
Tamil rebellion.
   Tamils, mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people and claim they are discriminated against by the
Buddhist Sinhalese majority in jobs and education.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population and dominate the
government and the military. Moslems make up 7 percent of the
population.
   The nearly 7-year-old Tamil separatist campaign has claimed more
than 9,000 lives. At least 3,500 people have died in the Sinhalese
backlash.

<HEAD>Experts Predict Problem Gamblers on the Rise in Iowa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER MUNNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gambling games have been sprouting like
corn in Iowa. In less than a generation the state has launched
high-stakes bingo, a lottery, dog and horse racing and now
riverboat gambling.
   Experts on gambling addictions say Iowa will harvest a bumper
crop of compulsive gamblers as a consequence.
   ``There's no question, some people are going to lead disastrous
lives, some families will be broken up, some parents will cash in
their individual retirement accounts,'' said Henry Lesieur,
associate professor of sociology at St. John's University in New
York.
   Lesieur and other experts on compulsive gambling gathered in Des
Moines this week for the state's fourth annual conference on the
subject. All agreed that the number of problem gamblers is bound to
increase as exposure to gambling increases.
   In the early 1970s, Iowa law didn't permit gambling and the
state attorney general made headlines by raiding the North Buena
Vista church picnic and confiscating bingo paraphernalia. Since
then, the state has allowed high stakes bingo, three pari-mutuel
dog tracks and a horse racing track, and state-run lotteries.
Beginning in 1991, it will also allow casino-style gambling on
riverboats.
   ``Yes, riverboat gambling will create jobs, but these other
things are going to happen, too,'' said Lesieur.
   The experts said pathological gamblers will find ways to lose
money even if gambling is not legal. But they also said that
incidents of problem gambling accelerate when states promote
gambling in the name of economic development.
   ``If there was no legal gambling, the problem would still be
significant,'' said David Gardner, spokesman for the Atlantic City
Casino Association. But he said casino owners are realizing they
have a role in helping prevent gambling addictions.
   Rachel Volberg, a researcher for the Policy Research Associates,
said Iowa's rate of problem gamblers is less than half that of
three Eastern states where gambling has a much longer tradition.
But she said the rate will grow rapidly.
   A survey of 750 adults in February, she said, showed that 1.7
percent of Iowans can be classified as problem or pathological
gamblers. That compares to 4.2 percent in New York and New Jersey
and 3.9 percent in Maryland.
   She said Iowa's rate was low because legalized gambling is
relatively new. It takes many years to develop into a problem
gambler, she said, adding that studies show people who ask help to
recover from compulsive gambling have been betting for an average
of 23 years.
   ``I'd say that if I came back in 15 years and did a prevalence
test, we'd find the numbers had doubled,'' said Ms. Volberg.
   ``I'm not an advocate of prohibition,'' she said. ``It's not a
question of pushing things back in Pandora's box. The vast majority
of people do it in control and enjoy it.''

<HEAD>12 Sentenced For Mob Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve blacks convicted of
involvement in the mob killing of a black police officer were
sentenced on Friday to prison terms of up to eight years and parole.
   Fourteen defendants in the highly publicized case were sentenced
last week to hang.
   Only one of the 26 defendants was found to have physically
contributed to the death of officer Lucas Sethwala, who was stoned
and set on fire on Nov. 13, 1985, in Paballelo, a black township
outside Upington in a remote area in northwestern South Africa.
   One defendant was convicted of attempted murder and the other 24
of murder under the doctrine of common purpose, which holds
individuals responsible for the actions of a crowd if they are part
of the group.
   The day of the killing about 3,000 blacks gathered on a soccer
field in the township to protest rent increases and other actons by
township authorities.
   Police dispersed the crowd, and most went home peacefully. About
300, however, regrouped and attacked Sethwala's home, according to
testimony.
   Judge Jan Basson said the killing was politically motivated and
part of a conspiracy to attack township authorities.
   Of the 12 people sentenced Friday, two were sentenced to eight
years in prison and four to six years; the others received
suspended sentences.
   Defense lawyers have said they will appeal the case.

<HEAD>New Technique Helps Scientist Trade Genes Between Animals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new biological technique should simplify the
slow and difficult task of shifting genes between creatures and
perhaps help scientists create healthier, faster-growing farm
animals, experts said Friday.
   ``If it's true, it will make life easier,'' said Dr. Richard
Hynes of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The new method uses nature's own gene carrier _ spermatozoa _ to
piggyback foreign genes from one animal to another.
   Scientists at many labs have already become adept at shifting
genes using other techniques, and they have created animals with
many unique properties never envisioned by nature.
   Such so-called transgenic animals may have many virtues
engineered into them, such as leaner meat, resistance to disease
and faster growth. Or they might produce human proteins in their
milk for use as medicines.
   In the new method, sperm were incubated with foreign genetic
material, or DNA, in a test tube. Some of the sperm captured the
foreign genes. When these sperm fertilized eggs, they passed along
the hitchhiking genes, which became part of the new animals'
permanent genetic code.
   ``If sperm will really carry DNA in, it will make it easier than
all the trouble we have to go through now to get genes in,'' said
Hynes. ``If it makes something easy that is now difficult, then
lots of people will do it.''
   The technique was developed by Dr. Corrado Spadafora of the
Institute of Biomedical Technology at the University of Rome. A
report on the work was published in Friday's issue of the journal
Cell, based in Cambridge, Mass.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. Max Birnstiel
of the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna wrote
that ``if confirmed by others, this publication will be a
cornerstone in biology.''
   Experts said the work also suggests that sperm may be a natural
point of entry for foreign genes. This may help explain how
genetically controlled traits could have passed between animals
over the course of evolutionary change.
   When used in mice, researchers were able to transfer bacterial
genes that produce an enzyme. Of 250 mice born from treated sperm,
30 percent showed the presence of the foreign genes.
   The scientists checked for the mice's ability to produce the
bacterial enzyme and also found that the new genes appeared to be
passed on to later generations of mice.
   Dr. Mario Capecchi of the University of Utah said that when used
in lab mice, the new technique is ``a lot simpler and cheaper'' but
probably no more efficient than the current technique, which
involves microscopically injecting foreign genes into one-cell
embryos.
   ``I don't think it will affect mouse biology, but where it may
have a big advance is where people are making transgenic domestic
animals, such as cows and sheep,'' Capecchi said.
   He said the current methods don't work particularly well in
these large animals, and the new technique may be more effective,
although that has not been tested yet.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright relaxed in his office
Friday as other Democratic leaders jockeyed for inside position in
the race to move ahead in the power structure after Wright's
resignation takes effect.
   ``He's taking calls. He didn't have much time to take them
yesterday,'' said Mark Johnson, the Texas Democrat's press
secretary.
   Wright, who announced Wednesday that he would step down as
speaker upon selection of his successor, spent Thursday doing
interviews with reporters.
   He planned a relaxed weekend, but planned to join the
congressional delegation traveling to Miami on Sunday for a
memorial service honoring Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., who died this
week.
   Wright's reign as speaker is expected to end Tuesday, the day a
Democratic caucus has been scheduled to nominate a new speaker,
almost certainly the current majority leader, Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   Republicans also planned to meet Tuesday to nominate Minority
Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill, as speaker.
   But there was no known opposition to Foley among the Democrats,
who hold a strong majority in the House, and it was a given they
will their own nominee rather than the Republican nominee when the
full House votes Tuesday after the separate party caucuses.
   Even among Republicans, Foley is well-liked and regarded as
showing much more courtesy to the minority party than Wright. Foley
said this week he wanted to turn the House away from the partisan
bitterness of the past few months and get legislators back to work
legislating.
   President Bush, returning from Europe on Air Force One, was
asked Friday about talk of a political war in the House.
   ``I don't like it,'' he replied.
   But the president, a former House member himself, declined to
offer advice on the new Democratic leadership team. ``The last
thing they need is advice from the executive branch about how to
proceed,'' Bush said.
   While Foley appears headed toward certain election, several
candidates are vying for the other Democratic leadership slots. The
voting for those positions probably will take place no sooner than
a week after next week's speaker election.
   Reps. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., are
competing for Foley's position of Majority Leader. Gephardt is a
member of the Democratic leadership who ran unsuccessfully last
year for the party's presidential nomination. Jenkins is a popular
member of the more conservative wing of the party.
   The No. 3 Democratic leadership slot, majority whip, is being
vacated by Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif. Coelho recently acknowledged
that he failed to report a loan from a savings-and-loan whose chief
executive helped set him up in a junk bond deal, and said he's
quitting Congress instead of enduring an ethics investigation like
the one that felled Wright.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., currently No. 4 in the
leadership, was considered likely to move up to Coelho's slot. He's
been fighting to maintain support since news reports this week,
based on unnamed sources, that the Justice Department was
conducting a preliminary investigation into personnel practices in
his office. Gray insists that he is not a target of investigation
and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh has promised an
investigation into the leaks that resulted in the news accounts..
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the chief deputy whip, and Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, also were campaigning hard for the whip's post.
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., an influential member of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, was checking his chances in that
election.

   Jewish settlers on Friday attacked and beat
Israeli peace activists trying to deliver food and medicine to
Palestinian children in Gaza Strip refugee camps. In the West Bank,
soldiers reportedly shot and killed a Palestinian teen-ager.
   Also Friday, Israeli media reported the army plans to restrict
the movement of settlers in the West Bank suspected of taking part
in vigilante raids on Palestinian communities.
   The developments followed a raid Monday by Jewish settlers on a
Palestinian refugee camp. A 13-year-old girl was shot to death in
the rampage.
   An Israeli court in Kfar Saba, near Tel Aviv, on Friday ordered
five Jewish seminary students suspected in the rampage jailed
pending further investigation.
   The seminary's spiritual leader, Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburg,
justified the slaying and said the blood of Jews and non-Jews
cannot be equated.
   ``We have to recognize that Jewish blood and the blood of a goy
are not the same thing,'' he told Israel radio. ``Every law that is
based on equating goys and Jews is completely unacceptable.''
   Zevulun Hammer, the minister of religious affairs, condemned
Ginsburg's statement. He said Jewish commandments forbid the
spilling of innocent blood, regardless of a person's religion.
   At least 70,000 Jewish settlers live in 130 enclaves in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in
1967. About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the territories.
   The peace activists, mostly from the coastal city of Haifa, were
met at the army-controlled Erez Junction checkpoint entrance to the
Gaza Strip by about 100 Jewish settlers carrying Israeli flags.
   The settlers tried to stop the activists from unloading their
gifts of powered milk and rice, and several fistfights ensued.
   One activist was seen with blood running down his face. The
roadside was littered with ruptured sacks of rice and broken boxes
of milk after the confrontation.
   Settlers began shouting ``PLO get out!'' and tearing apart signs
that read ``Food for the Children of Gaza.''
   The activists shouted to the settlers ``Fascists go home!''
before the army separated the groups.
   The army refused to let the activists deliver the goods and also
refused to keep the supplies until they could be picked up by
Gazans, the army spokesman's office said.
   It was intended for about 140,000 people confined to their
refugee camp homes by army curfew.
   A United Nations Relief and Works Agency official said people
were being fed in the camps and there were no food shortages. He
asked that his name not be used.
   Sarah Doron, a member of the leftist Mapam Party who
participated in the delivery attempt, told Israel radio the goal
``is simply humanitarian.''
   Also Friday, settlers from the West Bank enclave of Ariel
attacked Israeli journalists visiting the area, Israel radio
reported. They accused reporters of holding leftist views and beat
one on the head with a pistol, the radio said.
   Troops in the occupied territories Friday wounded nine
Palestinians, Arab hospital officials said.
   They identified the slain youth as Ayman Isbeh, 17, from the
West Bank village of Kafr Rai.
   Arab reports said he was shot and killed in a clash when
soldiers raided his village.
   His death raised to 504 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israeli occupation began in December 1987.
Twenty-two Israelis have died.
   An army spokeswoman said the military could not confirm the
death. But she said the army raided several villages, including
Isbeh's, and detained 19 Palestinians suspected of throwing
firebombs and grenades at Israeli civilians and troops.
   A report issued by the human rights group Al Haq-Law in the
Service of Man said at least 110 children aged 15 and under have
been killed in the revolt, 60 percent from gunshots, 30 percent of
tear gas-related symptoms and 10 percent from beatings or other
causes.

   The Presbyterian church must tackle such
complex issues as the effect of medical technology on the quality
of life if Christians are to face the uncertainties of the future,
a prominent educator told church leaders Friday.
   ``There is no question that the 21st century will be different
from the 20th,'' Roger Heyns told a symposium of the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.).
   For example, he said: ``It is probably not intelligent to resist
technological development. It is possible, however, to question
whether the determination to prolong life, regardless of the
quality of that life, is a desirable consequence of our
technological capacity to do so.''
   Heyns, former chancellor of the University of California at
Berkeley and later president of the American Council on Education,
was the keynote speaker for ``Continue the Journey: Symposium on
the Future'' being held this weekend on the eve of the church's
201st General Assembly.
   The week-long assembly begins Tuesday and will involve 622
voting delegates and an estimated 10,000 participants and observers
overall.
   The church, which traces its roots in the New World back more
than 400 years, has nearly 3 million members. Its first General
Assembly, marking the beginning of a new church organization in a
young nation, was held in Philadelphia in 1789.
   Among the items on the agenda for the voting delegates is the
selection of a new church moderator, or head.
   In his speech, Heyns said the future holds ``instability and
uncertainty' because of ``current domestic problems of enormous
complexity, such as AIDS, homelessness, and the continued presence
of an inequitable distribution of wealth.''
   ``The church has both a conservative and a radical role'' to
play in dealing with such problems, he said, because the church
must help form moral standards equal to the changes that will come.
To do that, he said, churches must stay in touch with reality by
listening both to God and to people.
   ``They get into serious trouble when they get out of touch with
either,'' he said.
   He also said the values set through the church must be flexible.
   ``For the church to be vital and relevant, the subject of what
is important to conserve and what is important to change must be
under constant study and lively debate,'' he said.

   Rescuers hampered by rain and
shifting ground searched on Friday for at least 21 people still
missing since landslides and a fire struck a remote gold-mining
community, officials said.
   The military and civil defense officials said 11 people were
killed in the twin disaster last Tuesday. A regional mines official
said the count included three men whose bodies had not been
recovered.
   Heavy rains caused a caused the collapse of a maze of tunnels on
the slopes of Mount Diwalwal in Davao del Norte province in the
southern Philippines. A blacksmith's charcoal fire was overturned,
starting a fire that destroyed at elast 180 shanties of miners and
traders, officials reported.
   Mario Luis Jacinto, regional director of the Bureau of Mines in
Davao City, said more than 500 people initially reported buried in
the landslide had been accounted for by late Thursday.
   ``The problem is ground movement,'' he said. ``Rock masses have
not settled down and working there is very dangerous.''
   Jacinto said cracks showed on the tunnel walls as early as five
hours before the cave-in, giving most miners enough time to get out.
   Landslides are common in this area 530 miles southeast of
Manila. Tens of thousands of gold prospectors have tunneled through
Mount Diwalwal since the early 1980s.

   Moslem separatists bombed a rail line
Friday near the border with Malaysia, derailing a passenger train
and slightly injuring three railroad workers, police and railroad
officials said.
   The bomb was detonated by remote control as the train neared
Narathiwat town, 700 miles south of Bangkok, a police officer said.
   Pairat Rojarearngam, spokesman for the state-owned railroad,
said four passenger coaches and a mail car were derailed.
   A note found near the scene claimed responsibility for a Moslem
separatist group called Pulo Pattani, said the policeman, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   About 4.5 million Moslems live in Thailand, where 95 percent of
the population is Buddhist. Moslem separatists seeking regional
autonomy have made sporadic attacks on Buddhists in the southern
provinces bordering Malaysia.

   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno will continue existing
policies toward the United States and other countries, and will not
ease his tough response to U.S. trade actions against Japan,
officials said Friday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe pledged ``consistency
and continuity'' in foreign policy from the new administration.
   Parliament chose Uno, 66, as the prime minister Friday and he
promised political reforms to avoid a recurrence of the Recruit
bribery scandal, which forced the resignation of Noboru Takeshita.
   Watanabe said Uno, foreign minister for the 19 months of
Takeshita's tenure, ``has been a cornerstone of Japan's
relationship to the United States.''
   Uno will represent Japan at the Paris summit of seven
industrialized nations in July and may visit the United States
before then.
   He has had tough words about the U.S. designation of Japan as a
potential target of trade sanctions. Using the new American trade
law to force concessions from Japan is ``like negotiating with your
fists up,'' he told a news conference Friday.
   The prime minister, a former head of Japan's Trade Ministry,
said he told U.S. trade representative Carla Hills in Paris earlier
this week that ``Japan and the U.S. are allies and allies are
supposed to trust each other.''
   ``We don't think Uno's position will change now that he has
become prime minister,'' Watanabe said.
   At the Paris meeting of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, other leading industrial powers issued
a statement implicitly criticizing the U.S. decision to name Japan,
Brazil and India as possible targets for retaliation under its
trade law.
   Japan's ambassador to the United States, Nobuo Matsunaga, will
leave Washington on Monday for a week of consultations with the new
government in Tokyo, Watanabe said.
   Although he said such consultations were routine when a new
government took over, Matsunaga was the only Japanese envoy called
home.
   The ambassador will brief officials on ``the current situation
in the United States and overall U.S.-Japan relations,'' Watanabe
said.
   ``Japan's relationship with the United States is on a sound
basis,'' he said. ``We are determined to solve any economic or
politial problems. No problems are insoluble.''

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas seized a hydroelectric
power station and threatened to blow it up unless President
Ramsewak Shankar agreed to meet them.
   Shankar met senior government officials in the National Assembly
on Friday to discuss what action to take, including sending the
army to take back the station.
   About 40 guerrillas, led by a notorious rebel leader known only
as Barabas, occupied the unguarded Afobaka hydroelectric power dam
on Thursday, then demanded by telephone to speak with Shankar or
other top government officials. Other threats they made were to cut
power to the capital or open the dam's flood gates.
   Before taking over the station, the rebels hijacked a busload of
26 workers of the Suriname Aluminum Co. returning from a shift at
the power plant. The rebels threw the workers off the bus and drove
off with it.
   In a televised speech Thursday night, Shankar called the
situation serious and said measures would be taken to resolve it.
He did not elaborate.
   Hit-and-run activity by the rebels has increased during the last
three weeks in the area around the power station, 125 miles south
of Paramaribo, capital of this Dutch-speaking South American nation
of 400,000 people.
   The attack came as the assembly was debating an amnesty bill in
a move to end the guerrilla war that began in 1986.
   Guerrillas led by Ronnie Brunswijk originally demanded the
ouster of junta leader and army commander Desi Bouterse, but
continued attacks against the army after Bouterse allowed free
elections in November 1987 and then stepped down.
   Brunswijk has pledged to negotiate peace with the government,
but Barabas and other renegade rebel leaders have continued attacks.
   Bouterse retained his army command and is still considered a
major power broker in Suriname, which gained independence from the
Netherlands in 1975.

   Two auto salvage workers who caught three
13-year-olds in a theft face false imprisonment charges after tying
up one of the boys and handcuffing and stuffing the other two into
a car trunk, police said.
   John Voth, owner of Action Auto Wrecking, said the Wednesday
night incident grew out of several years of frustration at having
thieves pilfer more than $100,000 worth of parts from his business.
   ``These guys are coming out here and taking me apart and I'm not
getting any help from anybody,'' Voth said. ``This has been
reported to police as an ongoing problem for several years. What
went on out here was only as a last resort.''
   Officers went to the isolated lot late Wednesday and found
lights on, a gate open and people running through the yard, said
police spokeswoman Mary Schumacher. Police then contacted Voth who
said employees Larry Wayne Henson, 29, and his brother, Richard
Henson, 32 had caught three boys stealing radiators and other car
parts.
   The Hensons had one boy tied up, but the two who Voth said they
had handcuffed escaped from the trunk of a junked car, apparently
with the help of a fourth person, Schumacher said.
   One of the youths later phoned police about the incident from
his home, Schumacher said.
   Larry Henson was issued a criminal summons for false
imprisonment and assault, and Richard Henson for false
imprisonment, Schumacher said.
   The three juveniles were charged with largency from yards.

<HEAD>Parliament Backs Halt To Dam Project, Premier Calls Dam A Symbol
Of Past</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Friday approved a halt in
construction of a mammoth hydroelectric project, pending
examination of charges that it would cause massive enviromental
damage.
   Asking for the indefinite moratorium, Premier Miklos Nemeth said
Nagymaros dam was an unwelcome symbol of past times in Hungary,
which is in the throes of political liberalization.
   ``What I want to fight against is not an object,'' he said to
applause. ``The enemy is a decision-making mechanism, a political
power structure,'' he said, in a clear allusion to the Communist
Party's past unassailability.
   After 90 minutes of debate, the 380-member legislature voted
with 30 abstentions to support the government's decision May 13 to
stop building the dam and power station on the Danube river, about
30 miles upstream from Budapest.
   The decision has delighted enviromentalists, who have said the
dam will destroy wetlands and their unique wildlife, and who have
gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures against construction.
   Bu the move angered Czechoslovakia, a Soviet bloc ally and power
project partner that has finished much of its part of construction
further upstream. Hungary is examining its legal options with
Czechoslovakia if it decides to permanently shelve its portion of
the project.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh threatened
Friday to fire Justice Department leakers but also criticized the
news media as ``aiders and abettors'' in publicizing unauthorized
information on a controversial story.
   He expressed the wish that journalists would share with federal
officials the names of their sources on the story and said that if
reporters would name anonymous sources, ``every leaker in town
would be gone before sundown.''
   Thornburgh, on Capitol Hill to testify on another matter, was
questioned about possible leaks leading to recent stories saying
Rep. William Gray's office personnel practices are under Justice
Department scrutiny.
   Gray, of Pennsylvania, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, has
complained vigorously about leaks and has asked for appointment of
an independent counsel to look into the matter.
   The attorney general has rejected that demand, but he told the
Senate Judiciary Committee he has appointed the No. 2 man in the
Justice Department, Edward Dennis, to seek the source of
unauthorized disclosures.
   ``He will have available to him whatever resources are necessary
to pursue these reports,'' Thornburgh said. He said that if the
``perpetrators'' were discovered it was likely ``they will be fired
immediately.''
   Thornburgh described ``our friends in the news media'' as
``aiders and abettors'' in the case but later said, ``That was
perhaps an unfortunate choice of words.''
   He raised the possibility that criminal laws may have been
violated in the release of word about the investigation but said
the news media appeared to be merely exercising their rights under
the Constitution.
   Thornburgh declined to say what laws may have been violated but
did not rule out the possibility of prosecuting the leakers.
   ``It's extremely difficult to pursue these investigations
without the cooperation of those in the news media,'' he said. ``I
can say without fear of contradiction that if we did have the
cooperation of the news media in these investigations, every leaker
in town would be gone before sundown.''
   Asked later what he meant by cooperation, Thornburgh said,
``Consenting to be interviewed and disclosing the source of the
leak.''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for
Freedom of the Press, took strong issue with Thornburgh's words
about reporters and anonymous sources.
   ``News gathering is protected by the First Amendment and to say
that this is something the news media should not be engaging in is
trampling on the First Amendment,'' she said.
   ``What I find so troubling about his remarks is the notion that
the news media has a responsibility to keep the government's
secrets for the government. That's the antithesis of what is the
news media's responsibility.''
   ``He is trying to do what the Reagan administration did so
brilliantly _ to make it appear you are unpatriotic if you don't
cooperate with the government on these investigations,'' Kirtley
said.
   Thornburgh was on Capitol Hill to report to the Judiciary
Committee on a long-running dispute with the American Bar
Association over judicial selection.
   Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., however, immediately
asked him about published reports of an investigation into
personnel practices within Gray's office.
   The reports based on news leaks surfaced as Gray is running for
the House leadership post of majority whip.
   Urged by Biden, Thornburgh promised to report back to the
Judiciary Committee on the results of his deputy's investigation
and to tell the panel what methods had been used.
   Biden urged Thornburgh to assign the investigative task to the
department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
   He noted that Dennis formerly was a U.S. district attorney in
Philadelphia, where Gray is the congressman, and said he would not
advise ``putting Mr. Dennis, a fine, honorable man, in the position
of having to investigate people he hired.''

<HEAD>Doctor Wants to Maintain Kidneys in Patients Without Heartbeat</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 12th graf, `Other experts...' to restore first reference

<TEXT>
   A transplant surgeon said Friday he's devised a
way to maintain kidneys in trauma victims for several hours after
their hearts stop, a plan that could ease the organ shortage but
one that's sure to spark controversy.
   ``It's clearly something we have to start looking at as a
source, because there is no other solution,'' said David Anaise,
clinical associate professor at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook.
   Anaise proposes tapping into the pool of patients who die in
accidents but are not sustained by respirators as are some
brain-dead victims, currently the sole source for transplant
organs. By the time relatives of unsustained trauma victims are
notified, it usually is too late for organ donation.
   Organs quickly deteriorate and thus become useless for
transplantation unless they are chilled and flushed with
preservatives.
   Anaise said trauma victims' kidneys could be maintained in their
bodies for up to five hours if solutions were pumped into the
organs via a catheter.
   With nearly 15,000 people awaiting kidney transplants in the
United States, the need for more organs is acute, according to
Anaise. He estimates the number of kidney donors could double if
kidneys automatically were maintained in trauma victims while
family consent was being sought.
   Last year, kidneys were offered from the families of 3,867
victims nationwide, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing. The kidneys of 96.6 percent of them, or 3,737, actually
were transplanted.
   The University of Wisconsin's Dr. Folkert Belzer, developer of a
new solution that has improved organ preservation, said he doubts
many kidneys would be obtained from trauma victims whose families
cannot be reached immediately.
   Anaise's plan is technically feasible, Belzer said, since
similar methods were used to a limited extent during the 1970s. The
results then were not encouraging.
   Some doctors worry about the ethical and legal ramifications of
maintaining kidneys for transplantation without family consent.
   ``It's certainly not as invasive as going ahead and removing the
organs,'' said Dr. J. Wesley Alexander, president of the American
Society of Transplant Surgeons. ``But you do have to make an
incision. From that standpoint, it is invasive.''
   Other experts fear a backlash against the traditional donation
system. ``At this time, it's not the way we're accustomed to,''
said Howard Nathan, executive director of the Delaware Valley
Transplant Program in Philadelphia. ``If a plan like that were
implemented, it would take some time to get the medical community
and public used to that type of procedure.''
   Anaise is prepared for resistance. Although he has permission
from University Hospital in Stony Brook to try the procedure,
provided there is family consent or a signed donor card, he wants
to familiarize his colleagues and the public with the idea before
he proceeds.
   ``The public may say this is horrible. Those kidney-snatchers. I
came to the emergency room for a check-up and ended up being a
donor,'' he said.
   Anaise emphasizes the procedure would not be implemented until
patients are pronounced dead.
   ``Nothing will be done until the time that normally an orderly
would have come to pick up this body and take it to the morgue,''
he said.
   Anaise said at the transplant society's annual meeting that he
would attach a catheter to patients without heartbeats for flushing
preservatives into their kidneys and removing blood from the
organs. Chilled solution then would be pumped from an ice bucket
through two tubes inserted into the abdomen to keep the kidneys
cold.
   The only marks on the body would be a 2-inch incision in the
groin area from the catheter and two small stab wounds in the
abdomen, Anaise said.
   ``Basically, you have a non-mutilated body,'' he said.
   If relatives decide against donation, ``they can take it (the
body) and bury it and the mortician will tell you, `Thank you. You
did basically what a mortician would have done anyhow.'''

   A meter maid was charged with assault after
she allegedly armed herself with a broken bottle and threatened the
owner of an illegally parked truck, police said.
   Camille Barns, 21, started to write a ticket for a pickup parked
on the edge of the French Quarter on Thursday, but the owner sat on
the rear bumper so that she could not read the license plate, said
police spokesman John Bryson.
   Barns and the truck owner, Norman Percy, argued loudly as she
filled out the citation without the license number and put it on
the windshield, witnesses told police.
   Barns became enraged, broke a soft drink bottle and walked
toward Percy, saying she was going to cut him before she threw the
bottle into the back of the truck and fled with two other meter
readers in a city van, Bryson said.
   Police issued Barns a summons to appear in Municipal Court on
Monday to answer a charge of simple assault, Bryson said. Parking
officials were in a meeting and not available to comment on whether
Barns would be suspended, a spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., urged the Bush
administration Friday not to arm non-communist guerrillas in
Cambodia secretly but rather to seek an accord with Congress on an
open U.S. policy there.
   ``There is much at stake here and it seems inadvisable to engage
in secret deals, secret policy, secret aid, and repeat the mistakes
of the very recent past,'' Byrd told the Senate.
   ``A policy review is clearly in order,'' said Byrd, the former
majority leader who now chairs the Appropriations Committee.
   ``If we are to re-engage in Southeast Asia let us do so,'' he
said. ``But let us do so only after thorough, open debate, with
discussions of options and the careful formulation of a new U.S.
policy in concert with other nations that wish to bring long-term
peace and stability to Cambodia.''
   Vietnam announced last April 1 that it will end its 10-year
occupation of Cambodia and withdraw all of its military forces by
next Sept. 30.
   American and Asian policy makers fear that in the resulting
vaccuum, forces of the radical Khmer Rouge may regain power and
resume the massacre widely believed to have claimed ther lives of
more than one million Cambodians during their 1973-1978 rule.
   During the years of the Vietnamese occupation, the United States
has helped in the international effort to feed the estimated
300,000 refugees on Cambodia's border with Thailand and, since
1985, has provided some non-lethal aid to non-communist factions in
the country.
   Byrd noted published reports this week that the Bush
administration is considering mounting a covert operation to supply
non-communist forces in Cambodia with rifles and other weapons.
   A principal beneficiary of such aid would likely be Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, a previous ruler of the country, who is seeking a
leading role in the government of post-occupation Cambodia.
   But some congressional leaders fear that military aid will fall
instead into the hands of the Khmer Rouge which is allied with
Sihanouk in efforts to topple the Vietnamese-supported government.
   Byrd said that U.S. hopes for an independent, sovereign and
non-communist Cambodia cannot be achieved through secret arms
transfers.
   ``It is inconceivable to me how anyone could think that a new
military aid program in Southeast Asia could be successful or
sustainable without building a strong national concensus to support
it,'' Byrd said.
   ``There is no short cut, no easy back door which can circumvent
and make unnecessary the building of a knowledgeable consensus for
new long-term U.S. policies in a region which has been purposefully
bereft of such policies since our involvement in Vietnam ended so
catastrophically,'' he said.
   ``Southeast Asia is fraught with too many memories, too much sad
history, too much spilled blood, for the United States to back into
a commitment, with no sense of where that commitment may lead,'' he
said.
   Byrd said that the current situation in Cambodia suggests that
``active, inventive, international diplomacy mgiht be considered
and might be fruitful.''
   ``An active American diplomatic role might well find a receptive
audience, and that is an option that I believe would find the
greatest amount of support from the American people,'' Byrd said.

<HEAD>Cristiani Wants Regional Effort to End Salvadoran War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani, in
his first full day in office, called Friday for a regional effort
to end his nation's leftist revolution and said it was as crucial
as dismantling the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Also Friday, insurgents denied they owned a huge arms cache
displayed as materiel captured from rebels. The exhibition is
``psychological warfare,'' they said.
   Jose Napoleon Duarte, the staunch U.S. ally who retired after
five years as president, traveled to Washington for cancer
treatment Friday. Duarte, 63, is dying of liver cancer.
   And the army's monthly duty orders, published Friday, show a key
clique of colonels consolidated its power.
   Cristiani, leader of the rightist Arena party, gave a press
conference in the presidential palace.
   He said the nine-year Salvadoran revolution is a regional
problem and should be dealt with in the context of the 1987
Esquipulas II regional peace plan.
   Under the plan, the five Central American presidents agreed in
February to promote the demobilization of Contra rebels based in
Honduras.
   Cristiani acknowledged the Contra plan ``has a head start. We
have no problem with that going ahead. But we would like to see
equal treatment given to the Salvadoran problem and progress there
too.''
   He reiterated accusations that Nicaragua's leftist regime helps
arm the Salvadoran rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   Nicaragua says it provides only moral support to the guerrillas,
known as FMLN.
   Cristiani said he will bring up the issue of alleged Nicaraguan
intervention during a Central American summit tentatively scheduled
for July.
   ``We hope that Nicaragua will cut its links with the FMLN,'' he
said.
   The armed forces Tuesday exhibited nearly 400 Soviet-designed
AK-47 assault rifles, 50 Soviet-made grenade launchers and piles of
other munition. Military spokesmen called it the biggest logistical
blow to the rebels in years.
   But the insurgents, on their clandestine radio, said it was a
show staged to implicate Nicaragua and ensure continued U.S.
military aid. El Salvador receives more than $1 million a day in
U.S. economic and military assistance.
   According to the army's June orders, the graduating class of
colonels known as ``La Tandona'' consolidated its power, retaining
or gaining command of seven of the eight army brigades. The
colonels are not likely to modify significantly the current
strategy of ``low intensity conflict.''
   The selection of Cristiani's defense minister deeply divided the
armed forces last week.
   Cristiani and other senior Arena party officials favored
hard-line air force commander Gen. Rafael Bustillo, according to
military and political sources. Col. Rene Ponce, in charge of the
joint chiefs of staff, also aspired to the portfolio.
   Because their rivalry threatened to split the armed forces,
sources said Gen Humberto Larios was chosen as a compromise
candidate. But he is considered a stopgap.
   Bustillo, who it is thought would escalate the conflict sharply
if he had charge of defense, reportedly is supported by key
colonels who do not belong to the ``tandona.''

<HEAD>Iran's President Calls For More Anti-Rushdie Protests in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran urged
Moslems in Britain on Friday to stage more demonstrations against
British author Salman Rushdie and denounced the arrest of 84
protesters in London last weekend.
   ``We support the movement of our Moslem brothers in Britain, and
encourage them to follow up on their freedom of speech,'' the
official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
Khamenei as saying in his Friday sermon at Tehran University.
   ``The great movement of British Moslems is the perfect example
that Moslems have been awakened by the message of the Islamic
revolution, and no power can stop this awakening.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary and spiritual
patriarch, issued a religious edict on Feb.14, calling on Moslem to
kill the Indian-born writer. He said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in
his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Demonstrations in central London by about 20,000 Moslems from
around Britain flared into violence last Saturday. Six police
officers were hurt and 84 protesters were arrested.
   Protesters waved anti-Rushdie banners and demanded his death.
They asked that blasphemy laws be changed so Rushdie's novel could
be challenged in court.
   Tehran-London ties were cut following Khomeini's death call.
   In Madrid, a Spanish business group that includes small
booksellers issued a statement Friday strongly criticized three
major department store chains for failing to put on sale the
Spanish edition of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The Confederation of Small and Mid-Size Businesses said the
stores of the El Corte Ingles, Garcia Celso and Galerias Preciados
chains acted out of fear and condemned the action as
``incomprehensible and representative of a total lack of commercial
ethics.''
   In separate statements, the three chains denied that they
jointly decided not to sell the book. They affirmed their right to
choose what they sell, but said no definitive decision had been
taken.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Friday
praised President Bush's latest arms control proposal as serious,
constructive and largely approaching the Soviet position.
   But he complained that 100,000 troops of other NATO powers on
West German territory are not included.
   The proposal has ``a definite imprint of new times,''
Shevardnadze said in an interview with Soviet correspondents
carried on the official news agency Tass the same day Bush returned
home from a European visit.
   NATO adopted Bush's suggestion to propose a ceiling of 275,000
troops for the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe. The
plan also calls for certain arms cuts to equal levels.
   Shevardnadze noted the NATO and Warsaw Pact proposals now agree
on tanks and armored vehicles, and their suggestions for limits on
artillery and combat helicopters are very close.

<HEAD>Austria to Press U.S. to Lift Ban on Waldheim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry is renewing efforts
to persuade the U.S. government to lift its ban on President Kurt
Waldheim traveling to the United States, a ministry official said
Friday.
   The United States barred Waldheim from the country on April 27,
1987, after the World Jewish Congress said it had evidence that
implicated the former United Nations secretary general in war
crimes during World War II.
   The U.S. Justice Department said in December 1987 that it had
evidence of Waldheim's complicity while he served as a junior
officer in the German army in Yugoslavia in World War II.
   Waldheim, who was elected president in 1986, has denied all the
charges.
   Members of Austria's coalition government are divided over
whether it should press the United States to lift the travel ban.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky visited the United States less than a
month ago and saw no reason to raise the issue in a meeting with
government officials, said a spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   But a Foreign Ministry official said, ``There is a plan to hand
President Bush a letter through Ambassador Friedrich Hoess in which
the new administration is once more given the Austrian viewpoint on
this topic.''
   The ban was imposed during President Reagan's second term in
office.
   The Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the letter did not contain new arguments. It was to
be delivered in the next few days, the official said.
   Vranitzky is chairman of the Socialist Party. Foreign Minister
Alois Mock until recently headed the conservative Austrian People's
Party.
   An international commission of historians, appointed by the
Austrian government, issued a report in February 1988 that said
Waldheim was ``in close proximity'' to some war atrocities, knew
they were going on and made no attempt to stop them.
   The U.S. Justice Department has said its evidence shows
Waldheim's complicity in the deportation of Jews from Greek islands
to concentration or death camps, the execution of Allied prisoners
and the execution of hostages and other civilians.

<HEAD>Israeli Official Calls New Argentine Government Anti-Semitic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel expects a large influx of Jews from
Argentina ``because the new regime is anti-Semitic,'' the
immigration minister said Friday.
   Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz, the minister, told a new conference
growing numbers of Argentine Jews had approached the Jewish Agency
in Buenos Aires.
   His reference was to the government of President-elect Carlos
Menem, a member of the populist Peronist Party, who is of Syrian
descent. Peretz did not elaborate on the statement or provice
evidence to support it.
   Menem was elected last month and is scheduled to take office in
November.
   The daily Jerusalem Post quoted Jewish Agency officials as
saying they expect immigration from Argentina to double this year
to about 3,000, but the newspaper said the main reason was the
severe economic crisis, not anti-Semitism.
   Argentina's currency has lost all but a fraction of its value
and inflation is about 70 percent a month. At least 14 people were
killed in food riots this week.
   Many Jews planning to immigrate to Israel ``can't afford a plane
ticket to another country and we have to help them with basic needs
such as clothes and suitcases,'' the newspaper quoted a Jewish
Agency official as saying.
   The demand for agency assistance to leave Argentina has been so
great that applicants must wait three weeks before even meeting
with a staff member, the official was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Iranian exiles left the United
States during the past year and went to Iraq to join the fight
against Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime, leaders of Iran's
main resistance group said Friday.
   About 1,000 anti-Khomeini Iranians rallied outside the United
Nations in a demonstration organized by the Washington-based
People's Mujahedeen (holy warriors) of Iran.
   There has been a power struggle in Iran to select a successor to
Khomeini, the nation's 86-year-old spiritual leader who is
recuperating in a Tehran hospital from abdominal surgery.
   Mujahedeen leaders said Iran's ecomony is in a shambles after
the eight-year war with Iraq, and government repressions continue
with hundreds of executions.
   ``It proves Khomeini's regime has no chance to stay in power,''
said 30-year-old Parvanah of Irvine, Calif., who declined to give
her last name to protect relatives still in Iran.
   She said, ``Khomeini is the Hitler of our generation, and I am
going to fight him'' along with her 31-year-old husband Toraj. They
have two daughters, 5 and 10 years old.
   She said she and her husband would join the Iraq-based National
Liberation Army, the fighting arm of the People's Mujahedeen, and
expected to meet friends who had already joined that force.
   ``I know personally dozens of them from Orange County,'' Calif.,
who went to Iraq to fight Khomeini's government, she added.
   ``I will do anything that they need of me _ anything to help the
National Liberation Army free my people and overthrow Khomeini,''
said Sadaf Ebrahimi, 23. She said she and her husband, Faramarz,
plan to leave for Iraq within days.
   ``There are a lot of people joining the National Liberation Army
here; I know dozens of them at the University of Texas at Austin''
who volunteered, she said.
   Alireza Jafarzadeh, an organizer for the People's Mujahedeen,
said ``I know personally hundreds by name who have gone in the past
year, and definitely there are more than that.''
   The Iranians said they were making their own arrangements to get
visas to travel to Iraq and declined to provide details.
   Spokesman for the People's Mujahedeen said the volunteers travel
independently and join the resistance army when they arrive in Iraq.
   Jafarzadeh said that is why there are no exact figures on the
number of exiles who have left America.
   The National Liberation Army has an estimated 15,000 fighters.
   Jafarzadeh said when the Iranians arrive in Iraq they undego
training for weeks or months, depending on their skills and the
tasks they will carry out. They then are placed in various army
units and the assignments are not based on what country they came
from, he said.
   The National Liberation Army, established in 1987, conducted an
offensive last July called ``Eternal Light'' and claimed two
Iranian border cities were captured.
   It said its fighters then withdrew and asserted that during the
campaign they killed or wounded 55,000 Iranians and suffered only
1,000 casualties.
   Iran said it trounced the opposition army, killing or capturing
thousands. Iran's ambassador to the United Nations said Iran
sustained 40,000 casualties.
   London-based Amnesty International and a U.N. human rights
investigator said Iran embarked on a ``wave of executions'' of
political prisoners after that campaign, with most of the victims
being Mujahedeen sympathizers.
   The Iran-Iraq ended last year with a cease-fire proposed in
Security Council Resolution 598.

   Police patrolling a rugged
Calabrian forest used as a Mafia hideout on Friday found the body
of a priest who had performed the marriage of a fugitive mobster,
authorities said.
   They said they suspected that the priest, Giuseppe Giovanazzo,
53, was slain late Thursday as part of a vendetta, linked to
rivalries in the 'ndrangheta organized crime group or to another
feud in this sparsely populated southern region of Calabria.
   The 'ndrangheta is the Calabrian version of the Sicilian Mafia.
   In October 1985, Giovanazzo performed the marriage of a fugitive
mob suspect, the Italian news agency news ANSA reported. Several
months later the priest said in an interview that it wasn't his
business to ``ask the penal record of someone getting married.''
   Giovanzzo's body was found in a small car in Polsi, a mountain
village in the Aspromonte forest. He had been shot in the face with
a shotgun.
   Police regularly patrol the forest in search of organized crime
suspects as well as kidnap victims. Kidnapping for ransom is
considered one of the 'ndrangheta's main ways of getting cash.
   ANSA said the priest taught religion classes at an elementary
school in Locri, on the Calabrian coast.
   He also helped with pilgrimages to a sanctuary in honor of the
Virgin Mary at Polsi, it said, adding that he was heading to the
sanctuary when he was killed.

<HEAD>Two Police Officers Indicted in Corruption Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two police officers were indicted Friday in a
wide-ranging corruption probe for allegedly defrauding the city of
money earmarked for undercover drug buys and confidential
informants.
   Former vice squad officers Shelton Roberts and James Whitaker
Jr. also were charged with allegedly obstructing courts in the
District of Columbia by filing false affidavits in support of
search warrants in drug investigations. In addition, they were
accused of obstructing a federal grand jury investigation of their
alleged illegal activities.
   Information compiled in the probe against a dozen other former
vice squad officers has been turned over to the police department
for ``appropriate administrative action,'' said U.S. Attorney Jay
Stephens. His office announced the federal grand jury indictments.
   Stephens said the referrals were made because his investigation
didn't establish sufficient credible evidence to prosecute the
other police officers.
   The lengthy investigation focused on the city's 4th police
precinct vice unit.
   Indictments against Roberts and Whitaker say they defrauded a
confidential police fund set up to pay for narcotics purchases and
to pay informants.
   Roberts and Whitaker allegedly forged and falsified police
documents, saying that in many instances the controlled buys
weren't made or informants didn't receive the money as claimed by
Robert and Whitaker.
   In 1986 and 1987, Roberts was involved in 121 alleged forgeries
while Whitaker was involved in 87, the indictments said.
   As a result of allegedly falsified affidavits, the U.S.
attorney's office said in 1987 that it would dismiss 300 to 400
pending drug cases ``in order to preserve the integrity of the
criminal justice system.''
   In addition, the indictments say that Roberts and Whitaker made
falsely sworn affidavits to support issuance of search warrants in
drug investigations.
   The affidavits recounted drug buys that didn't take place and
provided facts supporting the reliability of informants that were
untrue, the indictments said.
   Roberts was charged with six counts of obstruction of the
federal investigation while Whitaker was charged with two counts of
obstructing it.
   A 167-count indictment was returned against Whitaker and a
161-count indictment was returned against Roberts.
   If convicted on all the charges, Robert and Whitaker could face
up to life imprisonment.

<TEXT>
   A federal narcotics agent was charged with
drug trafficking Friday after he said spirits forced him to become
involved with a sect of drug-smuggling ritual killers.
   Salvador Vidal Garcia Alarcon, 39, a Federal Judicial Police
officer, told authorities his involvement with the sect was limited
to witchcraft and had nothing to do with drugs or the gruesome
murders uncovered at a ranch in Matamoros in April.
   Vidal Garcia, arrested earlier this week, pleaded innocent to
the cocaine trafficking charge in the 7th Federal Criminal Court in
Mexico City. Conviction can bring a penalty of seven to 25 years in
prison.
   Vidal Garcia was not charged in connection with the murders or
other crimes alleged against the sect led by Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo, a 26-year-old Cuban-American who died May 6 in a
shootout when police raided his hideout in Mexico City.
   The indictment filed Friday charges Vidal Garcia with the theft
of 4.4 pounds of cocaine from a dentist in the western city of
Guadalajara last year. He, Constanzo and Constanzo's right-hand man
allegedly stole the cocaine in a complicated scam that involved
posing as U.S. drug agents.
   Vidal Garcia is one of several police officers mentioned by cult
members during interrogation, but Deputy Attorney General Javier
Coello Trejo said Friday that Vidal Garcia is the only federal
agent involved with the cult.
   ``We are cleaning house,'' said Coello, head of the attorney
general's narcotics division.
   Coello refused to discuss statements by the sect's alleged high
priestess, Sara Aldrete Villareal, that the late Mexican head of
Interpol, the international police agency, was also involved in the
cult.
   Several members of the gang, including Ms. Aldrete, told
authorities that Vidal Garcia used his position on the federal drug
task force to provide protection to the smugglers.
   Ms. Aldrete also said that Constanzo told her he killed two men
as a favor to Vidal Garcia. Their bodies were later discovered at
the Matamoros ranch.
   When Vidal Garcia was questioned by fellow federal police agents
after the gang's arrest, he admitted knowing Constanzo and other
cult members but denied any wrongdoing. He said his relationship
with Constanzo and the others was limited to religious matters.
   Vidal Garcia said he had been possessed by three spirits since
birth. He said the spirits were useful in his witchcraft but that
when they took hold of him, it could be violent and painful.
   Officials declined to say whether the officer will be able to
remain on the force while his case is pending.
   Constanzo and his followers were the targets of massive manhunts
on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border set off by the discovery of
horribly mutilated bodies buried at the Matamoros ranch.
   Among the victims was Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of
Texas pre-med student. He was kidnapped, tortured and mutilated in
what sect members say was a ritual designed to provide magical
protection for their drug smuggling.
   Authorities uncovered 15 bodies in Matamoros, at least four of
them the victims of gruesome ritual murders, and they suspect
Constanzo or his Mexico City associates of being responsible for a
series of earlier cult slayings.

   Andrei D. Sakharov told a hostile Soviet Congress
Friday that the Soviet Union's ``criminal adventure'' in
Afghanistan was a shameful episode that cost 1 million lives. His
outraged colleagues denounced him as a liar.
   ``You have insulted our entire army, our entire nation, all our
boys who gave their lives!'' Tursan Kazakova of Uzbekistan shouted
at the noted human rights activist, drawing a standing ovation from
other members of the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Sakharov defended his statements, saying he wears his seven
years in exile for criticizing the war ``like a medal.''
   For eight days, the 2,250-member Congress _ the centerpiece of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political reforms _ has met in the
Kremlin to hear a litany of complaints about national economic and
social woes and barbed critiques of the ruling Communist Party and
Gorbachev.
   But none of the proceedings matched the sudden fury directed at
Sakharov, a member of the new Congress and the 1975 Nobel Peace
laureate.
   Before the Congress adjourned for the weekend, deputy Yuri
Karyakin advanced such heretical proposals as removing Soviet
founder Vladimir I. Lenin's body from the mausoleum on Red Square
and inscribing the names of the millions of victims of the Soviet
secret police onto KGB headquarters in Moscow.
   The Communist Party's more than seven decades of supremacy have
come under fierce attack at the Congress, the Soviet Union's first
parliament chosen in contested elections, and the party's
policy-making Central Committee met Friday night to evaluate the
Congress' work.
   In a terse dispatch, Tass news agency said the Central Committee
recommended that Politburo member Nikolai I. Ryzhkov be retained as
Soviet prime minister, a post to be filled by the country's new
legislature.
   Ryzhkov and the government ministries he heads have come under
fire in Congress for Soviet ailments ranging from bad roads in
Siberia to the disastrous state of the country's environment.
   The storm over Sakharov, 68, began when a veteran of the Afghan
war demanded an explanation of comments the physicist has made
about the Red Army's intervention in that country, which began in
December 1979 and ended in February under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   The Soviets were helping the Afghan government in its war with
Moslem guerrillas.
   To a loud ovation, former Soviet Army Maj. Sergei Chervonopisky,
who lost his legs in the war, took the rostrum at the Congress to
lambast Sakharov for ``unprecedented badgering'' of the Soviet Army.
   Chervonopisky, slowly rocking back and forth on his artificial
legs, demanded an explanation for an interview Sakharov gave to the
Ottawa Citizen, which quoted him as saying Soviet pilots were
ordered to kill soldiers they could not save from being captured by
Afghan guerrillas.
   The former major's emotional speech on behalf of ``the state,
the motherland and communism'' drew deafening applause, which
Gorbachev joined. Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, chairing the
session, did not want to let Sakharov reply, but Gorbachev motioned
with his hand to give the nuclear physicist the floor.
   ``The war in Afghanistan was a criminal adventure, and it's not
known who bears the responsibility for this enormous crime'' that
cost 1 million lives, Sakharov said.
   Even in the atmosphere of greater Soviet openness, such frank
condemnation was astounding.
   Visibly flustered at the angry response, Sakharov stammered, but
continued: ``We have to cleanse ourselves of this terrible shame. .
..I spoke out against sending Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan, and
for this, I was exiled to Gorky. I am proud of this exile in Gorky
_ I wear it like a medal.''
   The figure of 1 million killed is commonly known in the West but
not used in the Soviet media, which often portray Soviet troops as
the chief victims of the conflict.
   Gorbachev allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow from Gorky in
December 1986 after he spent nearly seven years in exile.
   Sakharov denied he had intended to insult the Red Army but said
no one could call his statements an insult until the truth is known.
   He said he had mentioned information in the interview he heard
on ``foreign radios.''
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, former Soviet chief of the armed
forces general staff, swept up to the rostrum to tell the Congress
that Sakharov's charges were ``a blatant lie.''
   Outside the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, Col. Gen. Boris
Gromov, the former Soviet commander in Afghanistan, also accused
Sakharov of lying. ``When our soldiers were killed there, we lost
even more people trying to recover their bodies, but we got them,''
said Gromov.
   The attacks on Sakharov and Sakharov's response were broadcast
live and later repeated in part on state-run television's evening
news show ``Vremya.''
   Sakharov was surrounded by reporters as he left the Kremlin
hall, and said he was sorry he hadn't been more explicit. ``I
regret I did not speak about all the crimes of the Soviet Army _
napalm, the bombardment of schools and hospitals,'' Sakharov said.
``There must be an investigation.''
   He called the attack on him a ``stage-managed spectacle.''

   The manufacturer of Alar, the apple chemical
that stirred a national furor over a possible cancer risk to
children, said Friday it is taking the substance off the U.S.
market immediately.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co. continued to defend the chemical as safe
but said continued use on apples ``is causing doubt and confusion
about the safety of America's food supply.''
   Apple growers and processors had pleaded for such action because
fears about Alar had drastically cut into apple industry sales.
   The company said sales of daminozide, which is marketed under
the name Alar, would continue to about 70 markets outside the
United States, including some that export apples and apple products
to this country.
   However, a spokeswoman for the International Apple Institute
said most imported apples are green ones, such as Granny Smiths,
which are not treated with Alar.
   Supplies of the chemical held by U.S. customers may be returned
for refunds, the company said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said late Friday it has
reached agreement with Uniroyal on a plan to monitor the removal of
Alar from the U.S. market, although there is no government ban on
its use. The EPA said it also will notify foreign governments about
agency concerns about Alar.
   ``The action taken by Uniroyal will significantly reduce risk
from exposure to daminozide,'' said Victor Kimm, the EPA's acting
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances.
   The EPA has said it plans to ban use of daminozide in food
products because tests in laboratory animals have indicated the
chemical can cause cancer. Final action on the proposed regulation
is not expected until late 1990.
   Uniroyal has disputed the findings. And James Wylie, company
vice president, said Friday, ``We want to emphasize that we have
not changed our opinion about the safety of daminozide.''
   The EPA estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the U.S.
apple crop is treated with Alar, a growth regulator that improves
the apple's appearance and gives it a longer shelf life.
   Wylie, of Uniroyal, said at a news conference, ``Our voluntary
action is taken to ease public confusion and, we hope, to let the
proven scientific process work.''
   ``Daminozide has become the focus of a needless controversy that
is causing doubt and confusion about the safety of America's food
supply _ a needless controversy that is hurting the apple industry
and the American public,'' he said.
   The company indicated that it intends to resume selling Alar if
a government scientific review, scheduled to be completed next
year, concludes the chemical is safe.
   Apple growers applauded the decision by Uniroyal, but some
suggested that the company should have made the move much earlier.
The International Apple Institute estimates that growers have lost
more than $100 million because of the apple scare over Alar in
recent months.
   ``They are darn late in getting to this point. We've been after
them for a long time and consumer confidence has been affected,''
said John McAlister of Tree Top Inc., the nation's largest apple
juice maker.
   McAlister said in Yakima, Wash., that Tree Top's sales have
dropped more than 20 percent since the Alar controversy began in
February, even though Tree Top and other processors have said
repeatedly they do not use Alar-treated apples.
   ``This action is most welcomed ... since it will allay any
remaining concerns consumers may have about small levels of Alar in
apples and apple products,'' said Larry Davenport, executive
director of the Processed Apples Institute.
   Many growers have stopped using the product since concern about
its health effects gained widespread attention earlier this year.
Wylie, although not providing any specific production figures, said
sales of Alar in the United States have dropped 75 percent during
the past three years.
   Earlier this year, a report by the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private environmental group, said young children are
particularly at risk from Alar and a variety of pesticides used on
fruits and vegetables because they consume large amounts,
especially relative to their weight, of apple products, other
fruits and vegetables.
   Although the government said the levels of Alar in apples were
not hazardous, the private group's report prompted many parents to
question whether they should continue to provide apple products to
their youngsters. School districts in a number of major cities for
a time stopped providing apples in school lunchrooms.
   Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the Uniroyal decision represented ``a capitulation to
public opinion'' but that consumers could still be exposed to the
chemical because it will continue to be sold in countries that
export apple products to the United States.
   But Maureen Miklavic, a spokeswoman for the International Apple
Institute, said exposure to Alar from its use in other countries
would be unlikely. Not only are most imports green apples and thus
free of Alar, she said, but imported apple concentrates are
expected to be closely monitored by the processing industry for
possible Alar content.
   Congress is considering legislation that would prohibit the
importing of Alar treated apples.

<HEAD>Goverment Plane Bombs Air Strip While Relief Plane Delivers Food</HEAD>

   A Sudanese government plane bombed a
landing strip in southern Sudan while a U.N. mercy flight was
unloading famine relief supplies, wounding three civilians, U.N.
officials said Friday.
   One woman's legs were mangled, said Charles LaMuniere, a U.N.
emergency relief official.
   In Kenya, Sudan's foreign minister said his government would
begin peace talks June 10 with rebels fighting for autonomy in the
south.
   Rebel leader John Garang, a former army colonel, offered to
extend a temporary truce through the end of June if progress was
made at the talks.
   Garang, who spoke to reporters during a visit to Geneva, accused
the govrnment of violating the truce by bombing the airstrip.
   A multi-agency relief operation is distributing food in southern
Sudan, where 100,000 people are threatened with famine caused by
the civil war.
   A U.N. flight landed at the rebel-held city of Torit on Thursday
and was delivering supplies when the Sudanese bomber attacked, said
John Usher of the U.N. Children's Fund
   As the bomber turned for a second run, the U.N. plane took off
and escaped. Usher said the Sudanese plane dropped 12 bombs.
   The $132 million aid project seeks to distribute food to remote
areas before villages and refugee camps are cut off by floods
during the rainy season. Last year, about 500,000 Sudanese died of
war-irelated starvation and disease.
   UNICEF director James Grant protested the bombing to Sudan's
U.N. ambassador, Amin M. Abdoun.
   Grant said later that he believed the attack was not ordered by
top government authorities. He asked for an investigation and
assurances there would be no repetition.
   Sidahmen Elhusain, the Sudanese foreign minister, said in
Nairobi he had no knowledge of the bombing except what he had heard
in news reports. He called it ``an isolated incident.''
   Torit fell to the Sudan People's Liberation Army on Feb. 26 and
has become a major redistribution center for relief supplies.

   The State Department said Friday it has no
plans to let the Palestine Liberation Organization reopen the
Washington office the Reagan administration shut down in 1987.
   The Washington representative of the Arab League, Ambassador
Clovis Maksoud, told reporters earlier Friday that he had asked the
State Department to permit the PLO to reopen the office.
   Maksoud said it was ``mind-boggling'' for the United States to
maintain a dialogue with the PLO, begun last December, while
refusing the organization permission to reopen its office here.
   The State Department, responding to press inquiries about
Maksoud's statement, said Congress in 1987 prohibited the
establishment of any PLO office in the United States.
   ``The reestablishment of the (PLO) public information office
would not be consistent with the terms of this law,'' the
department said.

   Thunderous applause greeted a police
officer Friday when he told a packed legislative hearing that the
only ``cured'' sex offender he knows is the rapist he shot to death.
   Tacoma policeman Stan Mowre was among witnesses at a hearing
where state senators unveiled legislation they said would crack
down on violent sex offenders. The measure was sparked by public
outrage over the sexual mutilation May 20 of a 7-year-old Tacoma
boy.
   The child, whose mother attended the hearing, was raped, choked,
and his penis severed in a wooded area near his home. The boy was
released from Mary Bridge Hospital in Tacoma on Wednesday in
satisfactory condition.
   Earl Kenneth Shriner, 39, is being held on charges of attempted
murder, rape, and assault in the attack on the boy. He has pleaded
innocent. Authorities say Shriner has a history of sexual violence.
   Most sex offenders are incurable, Mowre told the state Senate
Law and Justice Committee. ``There's only one that I know that was
cured, and that's the (rapist) I shot and killed in the line of
duty,'' Mowre said.
   Helen Harlow, the mother of the mutilated boy, spoke briefly and
calmly to the committee, telling lawmakers that sex offenders need
longer jail terms, special facilities, and long post-release
supervision.
   The public has a right to know who these people are when they
are released, said Ms. Harlow, and repeat offenders ``are going to
be harassed by the public as they should be.'' That remark drew
loud applause from the crowd.
   She said she still didn't understand why the system failed to
protect her child, and why a man with a history of violence against
young people was permitted to roam with no supervision.
   Officials have said that after Shriner served a 10-year prison
term for assault, authorities who considered him a sexual
psychopath could not get him committed to the state's systems for
the mentally ill because his past was too violent. And although he
was diagnosed as mildly retarded, his IQ was too high to qualify
him for homes for the developmentally disabled.
   In testimony Thursday before a House panel, Chase Riveland, head
of the state Department of Corrections, said people who suffer
developmental disabilities and mental illness ``frequently fall
between the cracks'' of the state's criminal and health systems.
   Ms. Harlow and others applauded the proposed legislation, which
includes doubling prison sentences for first-degree sexual assault
involving mutilation to 12 years for a first offense and
increasingly longer for repeat offenses.
   It also provides for post-release supervision from 10 years to
life, depending on the offender's record.
   Committee Chairman Kent Pullen, a Republican who co-wrote the
measure, said he wants a special session to pass the bill and
appropriate money to pay for the estimated 500 additional offenders
who would flood the already overburdened criminal justice system.
   Gov. Booth Gardner, a Democrat, said he was not opposed to a
special session if the legislation was appropriate. ``We want a
solution that would stand the test of time, not a solution that is
just window dressing'' he said.
   Friday's hearing was as much a venting of outrage over sex
crimes as a look at the proposed legislation.
   Lawmakers and one expert witness discussed whether castration is
better than special drugs to quell offenders' sexual urges, which
led one unidentified onlooker to stand and shout: ``Surgical is
better.''
   ``I'm not mad as hell. I'm enraged,'' said Ida Ballisiotes of
Seattle, whose daughter, Diane, was raped and killed in September
by a work-release inmate who had been classified as a sexual
psychopath.
   ``I don't want to hear again that this person or that person
fell through the cracks. I want the cracks filled,'' she said, on
the verge of tears. ``Our daughter was as innocent as that little
boy. I'm glad he lived. She didn't.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush returned from his
European mission Friday calling it ``a triumph of hope'' for a
world moving beyond the Cold War.
   Bush said the Western alliance is on the offensive for peace and
must stay there. After months during which Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev held the initiative in arms-control proposals, Bush
claimed it back.
   ``I am now returning from Europe with a message for the American
people _ a message of hope,'' the president said on arrival at
Pease Air Force Base in nearby New Hampshire. ``We have a great and
historic opportunity to shape the changes that are transforming
Europe.''
   The president said the opportunity grew from the strength and
resolve of the United States and its allies, and ``also because of
the power of ideas _ especially one idea which is sweeping the
communist world: democracy.''
   Bush was greeted at the air base by 2,000 people, including
military personnel and children let out of school for the event,
after his seven-hour flight from London, final stop on his
week-long journey to four nations.
   He told the cheering crowd that his conventional arms cut
challenge to Moscow is not an arrogant one but a bold, fair,
good-faith appeal.
   It was an upbeat finale to an upbeat week for Bush. Pronouncing
the European trip an unqualified success, Bush lieutenants
predicted its impact would carry over into domestic affairs.
   ``This helps,'' said John Sununu, the White House chief of
staff. ``We're going to try to take full advantage of it.''
   Bush was asked on Air Force One if the trip would give him
greater respect. ``I never thought I suffered from lack of
respect,'' he said, then laughed. ``You mean a little like Rodney
Dangerfield?''
   Bush began his day by planting a pin oak tree on the lawn behind
Winfield House, residence of the U.S. ambassador in London, to
commemorate his visit. Then he, Mrs. Bush and a six-helicopter
entourage flew to Heathrow Airport to board Air Force One for the
trip home.
   Bush chatted with aides and reporters, watched a movie, caught a
nap. Mrs. Bush showed off a gift from Queen Elizabeth, a framed,
autographed photo of the queen with one of the renowned White House
puppies. It was taken in May when she visited friends of the Bushes
at their horse farm near Lexington, Ky.
   Mrs. Bush, asked if she had seen news photos of her kissing the
hand of Denis Thatcher, husband of the prime minister, said, ``I'm
not going to be impulsive any more.''
   The Bushes plan to return to Washington on Sunday after relaxing
over the weekend at their Kennebunkport home.
   The centerpiece of the trip was the NATO summit in Brussels on
Monday and Tuesday, and Bush's presentation there of a proposal for
drastic reductions in East-West conventional forces in Europe, cuts
he said should come by 1993.
   In addition, the allied summit agreed to compromise settlement
of a disagreement over short-range nuclear missiles, which are to
be put on the negotiating table only after a conventional arms deal
is completed. The United States and Britain were wary of
negotiations; West Germany wanted them immediately.
   Bush said that compromise demonstrated the strength of NATO. The
alliance ``has never been more united, never been stronger,'' he
said.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser,
said, ``Everybody was happy. The last meeting at NATO was a real
love-in.''
   ``We met the challenge,'' Bush said in his homecoming statement.
``We agree to strive, to hope, for a Europe that is whole and free.
...
   ``Ours is not an arrogant challenge to Mr. Gorbachev; it is an
appeal in good faith,'' the president said. ``The summit was a
triumph for the alliance, a triumph of ideas. Most of all it was a
triumph of hope.''
   Bush said he was gratified by the response at home and abroad.
``While keeping our defenses up and our eyes wide open, we must
press forward. We must stay on the offensive. We must get to work
now to end the Cold War. The world has waited long enough.''
   Scowcroft said verification of conventional arms cuts will
present problems, but that checking will be easier because the
Soviets would have to cut 10 times as many troops as the United
States would.
   Scowcroft said the Bush proposal does not assume the Soviets can
be trusted. ``This is not built on trust,'' he said. ``Trust is the
last thing that comes between opposing sides. It is built on mutual
self-interest.''
   He said the emphasis will move now to the strategic arms
reduction talks, which resume June 19. Scowcroft said
administration preparation for those negotations ``will be sharply
accelerated now.''
   Bush also will be shaping his proposals for clean air and
environmental legislation. Sununu said that should be ready in a
week or 10 days.
   It will go to a House awaiting new Democratic leadership, with
the coming resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright. Bush issued a
statement praising Wright's achievements after the speaker
announced his resignation in the face of ethics charges.
   In response to a question on Air Force One, Bush said he is
disturbed by talk of a political war between Democrats and
Republicans in the House. ``I don't like it,'' he said.
   But he declined to offer advice to lawmakers as they prepare to
install a new leadership team.
   ``The last thing they need is advice from the executive branch
about how to proceed,'' he said.

   A Soviet satellite booster rocket re-entered
the atmosphere over the U.S.-Canadian border with no sign that any
debris reached the ground, a State Department spokesman said Friday.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported the launch Wednesday and
said in a later dispatch that the third stage of the Proton rocket
booster, which had put three satellites into orbit, descended over
the U.S.-Canadian border.
   There was ``no indication that any debris of any kind hit the
ground,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. He said
the descent of such boosters is a routine occurrence and that they
almost always burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.
   In a statement released later, the department said U.S. and
Soviet officials ``have been in contact'' about the matter, but the
agency did not identify which officials or at what level.
   ``The Soviets offered to address any U.S. concerns which may
arise regarding the matter,'' the statement said.
   Capt. Thomas Niemann of the U.S. Space Command at Colorado
Springs said the Soviet rocket booster was tracked back into the
atmosphere at 2:54 p.m. EDT Wednesday at 48.5 degrees north and
about 96 degrees west, which would place it over Minnesota's border
with Canada.
   Command spokesman Dugald Gillies said the agency keeps track of
7,000 objects orbiting around the earth. He said man-made objects
fall out of orbit about once a day but rarely draw much attention
unless the re-entries occur over populated areas at night so they
can be seen. Debris very rarely reaches the ground, he said.
   Tass said the rocket launch was designed to test elements of a
global space navigation system being created to track civil
aviation aircraft and vessels of the Soviet maritime and fishing
fleets.

<HEAD>Harris Corp. Pleads No Contest</HEAD>

   Harris Corp. pleaded no contest Friday to a
criminal charge it aided and abetted the filing of a false
statement by a Filipino businessman convicted of defrauding the
Defense Department.
   The Melbourne, Fla.-based company agreed to pay $200,000 in
fines and $300,000 to settle civil claims against it by the
government arising from a longstanding investigation of fraud
involving weapons sales to the Philippines.
   The company entered the no-contest plea in U.S. District Court
in nearby Alexandria, Va. The action was annunced by the Justice
Department in Washington.
   The conviction stems from a lengthy Justice Department
investigation of fraud against the Defense Department, which loans
money to countries to finance military sales.
   Harris admitted that its Farinon Division agreed to falsely
inflate to $3.38 million the value of a $2.4 million subcontract it
obtained from businessman Raymond F. Moreno to sell electronic
equipment to the Philippines military under the program, the
Justice Department said.
   Harris-Farinon agreed to kick back $1.03 million of the $3.38
million to a Hong Kong shell corporation operated by Moreno in the
guise of a marketing fee, the Justice Department said.
   Moreno, who pleaded guilty in 1987 to defrauding the Pentagon,
submitted inflated invoices to the Pentagon's Defense Security
Assistance Agency that disguised the kickback arrangement, the
Justice Department said.
   Moreno paid a $30,000 fine plus $950,000 in civil and tax
judgments.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, disclosed in court papers
filed in Moreno's case that Harris' Digital Telephone Systems
division paid a $1 million kickback to Moreno on another
subcontract. This transaction was not part of Moreno's false filing
with the Pentagon.

   A deputy galvanized the new Soviet parliament on
Friday by proposing to restore citizenship to Alexander
Solzhenitsyn and to inscribe the names of millions of Stalin's
victims on the walls of KGB headquarters.
   Yuri Karyakin, an outspoken writer from Moscow, also proposed
removing the body of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin from its
hallowed mausoleum on Red Square and burying it.
   Addressing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev by name and the entire
Congress of People's deputies, Karyakin demanded, ``Return our
Russian citizenship to a person who dared to speak the truth first
about Stalin's system, who was the first to call on himself and on
us not to lie, to the great writer of Russia, to the great humanist
Solzhenitsyn.''
   Some of the 2,250 deputies in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses
applauded the appeal by the 58-year-old, gray-bearded deputy from
the Academy of Sciences.
   Solzhenitsyn wrote extensively about the bloody terror of
dictator Josef Stalin's rule from 1924-1953, but his most biting
novels were never published in the Soviet Union.
   He was branded a traitor and stripped of his citizenship in
1974, expelled, and now lives in Vermont.
   Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970, is
best known in the West for his books ``Gulag Archipelago,'' ``One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and ``Cancer Ward.''
   Only ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' has been
published in the Soviet Union, but a literary journal plans to
excerpt ``Gulag Archipelago,'' a chronicle of Stalin's labor camps,
by year's end.
   No immediate reaction to the Solzhenitsyn proposal came from the
Soviet leadership, but on Thursday, Vadim A. Medvedev, a member of
the ruling Politburo, said in an interview that Solzhenitsyn was
against Soviet power and Lenin and that ``Gulag Archipelago'' was
``anti-Soviet.''
   Two deputies _ Moscow populist Boris N. Yeltsin and Lithuanian
Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas _ said in interviews they
supported Karyakin's call.
   Karyakin also said the secret police headquarters, called the
Lubyanka, should bear a reminder of those who suffered under Stalin.
   ``If we have not lost our memory, if we have not killed our
conscience, then we must write on the building on Lubyanka square
the names of 40 million _ we do not know the exact figure _ who
died because of and in connection with the orders of Lubyanka,'' he
said.
   A citizens group, Memorial, is campaigning _ with Gorbachev's
backing _ for a monument to be built to Stalin's victims. Stalin
killed millions through his forced collectivization of agriculture
and executions of real or imagined enemies.
   To a grumbling audience, Karyakin stood before a huge, white
statue of Lenin and said Lenin wanted to be buried beside his
mother in St. Petersburg, later renamed Leningrad, but his will was
ignored and his body was placed in a stone mausoleum after his
death in 1924.
   Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, opposed putting Lenin in an
above-ground mausoleum where his body could be viewed, but Stalin
and other party leaders overruled her.
   Yeltsin said he opposed the suggestion to remove Lenin's body
and bury it in Leningrad because the mausoleum is a ``symbol of our
revolution'' and should not be touched.
   In April, members of the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee condemned a similar suggestion.
   Millions of Soviets visit the mausoleum each year to show their
reverence to the founder of the Soviet state.

   A jury convicted two men Friday of
robbing $286,000 from a bank and threatening potential witnesses,
and one was found guilty of murdering a partner who the robbers
feared would sell them out.
   Sentencing was set for Aug. 14 for John P. McCoy of Slaters
Branch, Ky., and Doyle David Moore of Lovely, Ky. They were found
guilty of being two of the four men who held up the Matewan
National Bank branch at Kermit on Jan. 3, 1987, in what was
described as West Virginia's biggest bank robbery.
   During six days of testimony, prosecutors relied heavily on
Harold D. ``Boonie'' Runyon, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy as
part of a plea bargain and admitted taking part in the robbery.
   Runyon testified that he and McCoy, described as the ringleader,
shot and killed another of the robbers, Russell Davis, atop a
mountain in eastern Kentucky after learning that Davis met with
federal officials in Florida.
   ``He was a threat to us,'' Runyon had said when he entered his
guilty plea. ``There was no reasoning with him. We took him to a
hill and shot him.''
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said the four robbers split the
money evenly, but that after Davis was killed, Runyon and McCoy
split his share. No money has been recovered.
   Davis had met with federal officials shortly after the robbery
about a counterfeit charge pending against him in Kentucky. Carey
said Davis had told McCoy and Runyon about the meeting, then
demanded the rest of his share from the bank robbery.
   McCoy and Runyon, fearing Davis would call attention to himself
and get arrested, killed Davis to silence him, Carey said.
   McCoy, 43, was convicted of robbery, conspiracy, threatening
federal witnesses and killing a potential government witness,
Russell Davis, another of the robbers. He faces up to life in
prison and a $2 million fine.
   Moore, 27, was convicted of robbery, conspiracy to commit
robbery and threatening a witness. He was found not guilty of
threatening another witness and of conspiring with McCoy to
threaten others, and was not charged in the death of Davis. He
faces up to 40 years in prison and a $750,000 fine.
   Before the trial began, prosecutors said that the suspects
plotted from jail to kill other potential witnesses _ people who
had heard them discuss the crime _ and flee to the Caribbean. One
potential witness died of undetermined causes last month, but
prosecutors ruled out foul play.
   Defense attorneys argued to jurors that the government witnesses
were not to be trusted, especially Runyon, because of his plea
bargain. Runyon said under cross-examination that he pleaded guilty
with the hope that he would avoid Kentucky's electric chair for his
role in killing Davis.
   ``They say Boonie Runyon had no reason to lie. With over 2,000
volts of electricity flowing through his body after his head had
been shaved ... that is a powerful motivator. That is a powerful
motivator to lie,'' said J. Michael Curtis, representing Moore.
   West Virginia doesn't keep records on bank robberies, but
officials said they could not remember a bigger one.

   Pope John Paul II preached against a
godless world Friday and visited his northernmost flock in the Land
of the Midnight Sun.
   In a city better known for nightclubs than devotion, thousands
of people braved a 39 degree chill and gray skies that hid the sun
as the pontiff led evening prayers.
   ``We are gathered this evening in the long bright twilight of
the north, in the light of the unsetting sun which so clearly
symbolizes Christ,'' John Paul said. He wore a white overcoat and
spoke in English.
   Tromsoe, an island in a fjord surrounded by snowcapped peaks, is
at 70 degrees latitude, 217 miles inside the Arctic Circle. It is
the northternmost outpost of the church, with 680 Roman Catholics.
   ``I'm surprised so many people came, but we don't get many
famous people here,'' said a young woman in blue jeans and a ski
jacket.
   John Paul spoke from a wooden altar erected in the market square
beside a bronze statue of a whaler with a harpoon. This cod-fishing
center of 48,000 people has 15 nightclubs and has been dubbed ``The
Land of the Midnight Fun.''
   On the second day of his Scandinavian pilgrimage, John Paul
first visited the bustling fjordside port of Trondheim.
   Small but enthusiastic crowds lined the streets as he arrived on
a clear, crisp day. A band played ``Down by the Riverside.''
   In an interview with Norwegian television, the pope said he felt
at home in Norway, not like an outsider in an overwhelmingly
Lutheran country with only 27,800 Catholics.
   He was asked asked why the church does not allow women to be
priests and suggested the questioner read a document on women he
issued this year. It ruled out women priests because of tradition
and because Christ was a man.
   In visiting Norway, the pope has stressed the long Christian
tradition in Scandinavia before it broke with Rome four centuries
ago.
   Addressing an ecumenical prayer service and later a Mass in what
was the center of Catholicism in pre-Reformation Scandinavia, John
Paul mentioned St. Olav, his son Magnus the Great and other early
Christians who played important roles in Norwegian history.
   ``As Christians we proclaim a wisdom that recognizes and upholds
the priority of ethics over technology, the primacy of the person
over things, the superiority of spirit over matter,'' he said.
   ``Before us lies the duty of opening a new Christian chapter in
history in response to the many challenges of a changing world.''
   ``Christians understand what is at stake,'' John Paul declared.
``The history of our own century clearly shows that where no
transcendent norm is acknowledged people are in danger of
surrendering themselves to forces which take command of society
without concern for individuals and their freedoms.''
   Meetings with Lutheran leaders have been a high point of the
Norway visit, producing frank exchanges on what separates Lutherans
from Rome.
   A 62-year-old Lutheran, Anne Krigvoll, said she traveled 50
miles to see John Paul in Trondheim because, though she has
differences with him, ``he too is interested in the real values,
the spiritual values.''
   The pope's 10-day tour moves to Iceland on Saturday. He also
will visit Finland, Denmark and Sweden before returning to Rome
next Friday.

<HEAD>Wine Expert Who Educated Many Americans Dies in France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BORDEAUX, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wine expert Alexis Lichine, who informed
many Americans about French wine through popular books about
viniculture, died at his vineyard north of here. He was 75.
   The Russian-born American, whose books included ``Alexis
Lichine's Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits,'' died Thursday at
Chateau Prieure-Lichine in Cantenac. The cause of death was not
immediately released.
   Roger Suger, president of the Margaux wine syndicate and owner
of the Chateau Malescot-St. Exupery, said: ``He was our ambassador,
our bridgehead to America.''
   Jean-Paul Kauffmann, editor of L'Amateur des Vins de Bordeaux, a
quarterly magazine specializing in Bordeaux wines, said: ``At each
meeting, I was impressed by the Falstaff side of this man who spoke
loudly and strongly.''
   Lichine was married and divorced five times, including once to
actress Arlene Dahl. He was born Dec. 3, 1913, in Moscow the son of
a White Russian lawyer and banker. As Russia struggled its way
toward revolution, the family fled to the United States, and later
to France.
   Lichine was educated in Paris and at the University of
Pennsylvania. During the war, he was an aide to Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower, commander of the allied forces in Europe, and was an
intelligence officer. He returned to the United States in the 1930s
and went into the wine importing business.
   In 1951, he bought the Chateau-Prieure Cantenac vinyard, later
changing its name to Chateau-Prieure Lichine.
   His books went through multiple editions and revisions. He
contributed articles to numerous American magazines, including
Esquire, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and the New Yorker.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hail and damaging winds accompanied thunderstorms that developed
Friday along a cold front curving through the Northeast, and in New
Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma.
   High wind swept through the city commons in Fitchburg, Mass., 45
miles west of Boston, toppling trees, power lines and two church
steeples and forcing the evacuation of a damaged housing complex
for 200 elderly people, officials said.
   A thunderstorm moving through eastern Pennsylvania produced golf
ball size hail at Pennsville, dime size hail at Deepwater, and wind
gusts of up to 62 mph. Thunderstorms in New Jersey brought wind
gusts of up to 60 mph at Mantloking.
   The threat of severe weather from thunderstorms stretched from
northeastern North Carolina to southeastern New York state and
southern New England and from eastern New Mexico and the western
half of Texas to southern Nebraska and eastern Colorado.
   A thunderstorm southwest of Amarillo, Texas, produced dime-size
hail at Canyon, Texas, and three isolated funnel clouds were
sighted near the Mississippi River in eastern Arkansas.
   Showers and thunderstorms clustered over much of the
south-central states, from central Gulf Coast region to Tennessee
and southern Arkansas. A mid-morning thunderstorm in northeastern
Alabama produced dime-size hail and wind gusts to 62 mph at Gadsden.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from Vermont and eastern
New York state through eastern Pennsylvania and western Virginia
into Kentucky.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT
included an inch and a third at Muscle Shoals, Ala., an inch and a
quarter at Burlington, Vt., nine-tenths of an inch at Plattsburg,
N.Y., and two-thirds of an inch at Knoxville, Tenn.
   Norfolk, Va., tied its record high for the date with 97 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 100 degrees at New Bern, N.C.
The low for the nation Friday morning was 28 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   The forecast for Saturday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms across much of the nation from the Atlantic Coast to
the southern high Plains, the central Rockies and the northern
Plateau west of the central Rockies. Showers and thunderstorms
should be most numerous from Montana and Wyoming to Oklahoma and
Missouri, and across the lower Ohio Valley. Fair to partly sunny
skies were predicted across the West and over south-central Texas,
the upper Mississippi Valley, Florida and southern Georgia and the
northern Atlantic Coast states.
   Temperatures were predicted in the 90s from southern and central
interior California across much of Texas to the southern Atlantic
Coast. Highs elsewhere should generally be in the 70s and 80s,
except for 60s from Idaho to Nebraska and the Dakotas, and over
Wisconsin, Upper Michigan and northern Minnesota.

<HEAD>Mexican Authorities Announce Arrests of Two Drug Gangs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said Friday they had smashed two
cocaine- smuggling operations linked to Colombia's infamous
Medellin cartel.
   Javier Coello Trejo, deputy federal attorney general, said one
gang was led by Magdalena Pineda Trindad, a Guadalajara woman said
to be a representative of the drug cartel in Mexico.
   He said federal agents arrested 14 people in one gang this week
and seized 3,685 pounds of cocaine destined for the United States.
He said they also seized houses, ranches, 16 bank accounts, four
currency exchange companies, a hotel, drug laboratory, jet plane
and heavy construction equipment used to build air strips.
   Coello told a news conference seizure of the currency exchange
houses and bank accounts struck the core of the gang's
money-laundering operation. Federal agents also seek U.S.
cooperation in investigating several bank accounts in the United
States, he said.
   ``We have touched the heart of drug trafficking: the money,''
Coello declared.
   The gang used computers and sophisticated communications
equipment to intercept telephone calls and operate clandestine air
control centers for drug planes from Colombia, he said.
   Coello said the 14 suspects were two Colombians, a Chilean and
11 Mexicans, including a banker who allegedly helped launder money.
He said they face various charges involving drugs, guns and money.
   The case developed from two arrests at a checkpoint set up in a
border drug interdiction operation earlier this year, according to
Coello.
   He said the arrests and seizures occurred over four days in
several locations of northern and central Mexico, with the biggest
drug caches found in the northern states Coahuila, Tamaulipas and
Jalisco.
   Police accountants were sorting through records to determine the
value of the seized assets, he said.
   Coello said the gang manufactured a synthethic drug called
``Ecstasy'' in the clandestine lab. He said a nationwide search was
under way for Ms. Pineda Trindad, the alleged leader, who was
believed to be about 50 years old and had led the life of an
affluent businesswoman.
   The second gang, also based in Guadalajara, was led by a
Colombian named Jaider Curiel Choles, the deputy attorney general
said. He described Curiel Choles as ``the principal Medellin cartel
contact in Mexico.''
   Federal Judicial Police arrested Curiel Choles and 16 others in
a series of raids this week, Coello said, conficating 35 pounds of
cocaine, a house in Guadalajara, several bank accounts, two
vehicles and several weapons.
   He said the gang trafficked in marijuana and LSD as well as
Colombian cocaine bound for the United States.

<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov has defied the Kremlin and the KGB
secret police, and on Friday he faced a new kind of foe _ outraged
representatives in the country's new elected Congress.
   The raucous parliamentary fray, carried on national television,
involved Sakharov's condemnation of Soviet actions in the war in
Afthanistan.
   After the angry exchange the frail human rights activist told
Western reporters, ``I can take it.''
   A veteran wounded in the war and now a member of the Congress of
People's Deputies demanded an explanation for a statement Sakharov
made in an interview with a Western newspaper: that Soviet pilots
in Afghanistan were ordered to kill comrades in danger of being
captured by rebels.
   In a booming voice, Sergei Chervonopisky accused Sakharov of
defaming the memory of the 15,000 Soviet soldiers killed in
Afghanistan.
   There was thunderous applause in the Kremlin's Palace of
Congresses for the passionate speech by the former paratroop major
who lost both legs in the war and said his artificial limbs were so
painful ``I wouldn't wish them on my enemies.''
   On a signal from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the 68-year-old
Sakharov, a member of the Congress, was given the floor to respond.
In a halting voice, he repeated his criticism of the Kremlin's
decision in December 1979 to send troops into Afghanistan to help
the Marxist government. The Soviets withrew their forces last
February under a U.N.-sponsored pact.
   Sakharov called the Soviet Union's conduct in Afghanistan ``a
war of annihilation against an entire people.'' It was his
outspoken opposition to the Soviet intervention that led to his
arrest in January 1980 and almost seven years in internal
banishment in the closed city of Gorky.
   Sakharov told the Congress that in the interview mentioned by
Chervonopisky about Soviet pilots he was repeating information he
had heard on foreign radio stations and the allegations were being
investigated.
   Many deputies reacted furiously, shouting and clapping their
hands to interrupt him.
   When a woman elected from the Central Asian republic of
Uzbekistan took the microphone to shout that Sakharov should be
ashamed, an overwhelming majority of deputies, including members of
the ruling Communist Party Politburo, rose in a standing ovation.
   Sakharov sat impassively in his chair as a series of deputies
took the floor to denounce him or accuse him of lying.
   Sakharov told Western reporters later that he had expected a
hostile reception, and he said he could have spoken better.
   He expressed one regret: not giving what he called a a more
complete description of ``all the crimes of the Soviet army'' in
Afghanistan.
   Sakharov, a nuclear physicist, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.

   A school bus returning from a field trip
plunged off a mountain road and overturned Friday, killing a
sixth-grade pupil and injuring 35 other schoolchildren.
   Most of the injuries were minor, said Sgt. Larry Tolar of the
State Patrol in Denver. The injured were being transported by
helicopter and ambulance to hospitals in Longmont, Boulder and
Denver, he said.
   The name of the victim, a 12-year-old boy, was not released
pending notification of relatives.
   The bus, with 41 children aboard, went off Colorado 7 three
miles southwest of Lyons in the Front Range foothills, Tolar said.
It plunged about 20 feet down an embankment and overturned onto
rocks beside South St. Vrain Creek.
   The bus, descending the canyon road, left long skid marks before
it ran off the highway. Apparently no other vehicles were involved.
   Tolar said other details about the accident, which occurred at
2:20 p.m., were not immediately available.
   The children were sixth-graders from Whittier Elementary School
in Boulder, said Ann Burton of the Boulder Valley School District.
They had gone to Highlands Camp near Allenspark on a one-day field
trip, she said.

<HEAD>Centennial Commission Decides to Keep Gigantic Quilt in One Piece</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State officials said Friday they won't
dismantle the world's largest quilt, stitched for the state's
centennial. But a more troublesome question remains: What do you do
with an 800-pound bedcover?
   ``It is not an historical artifact today. A hundred years from
now it will be,'' Centennial Commission member Vern Neff said
before the panel voted 13-2 to keep the quilt in one piece.
   Leona Tennyson, 74, who with 7,000 volunteers from across North
Dakota stitched together the quilt, has sworn to ``fight to the
end'' to keep her labor of love from being dismantled.
   The quilt, certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as
the world's largest a year ago, measures 85 by 134 feet, 1{ times
as long and wide as a basketball court.
   Still, the commission has no idea how the quilt will figure in
its plans for the state's 100th birthday celebration this year.
   The giant bedcover, which takes as many as 40 people to carry,
depicts each of the state's 53 counties and 1,358 townships. It is
being stored at Minot State University's athletic center.
   Some people say the quilt should be dismantled and returned to
the counties that made its parts because it is unmanageable in its
present form.
   The state museum has turned it down, but Tennyson has pledged to
find a permanent place to display her creation, with or without the
state's help.
   In voting to keep the quilt intact, the Centennial Commission
asked Tennyson to set the conditions under which she will surrender
it.
   Tennyson was unswayed Friday by the commission's decision to
keep the quilt in one piece.
   ``I have said that from the start,'' she said in a telephone
interview from her home in Antler. ``I don't know what to say. I am
not going to say nothing about it until I can decide what is what.
We have plans here too for it.''
   State Tourism Director Jim Fuglie said the quilt simply was too
precious to think about dismantling. ``It may be the most special
thing that comes out of this centennial,'' Fuglie said.
   The Adams County Tourism Committee was specific in its request
to acquire the quilt.
   ``Our plans are either to cover the quilt with a layer of
Plexiglas or construct a series of catwalks which would allow
viewers of the quilt to walk several feet above the surface of the
quilt,'' wrote Jeff Rotering, a lawyer in Hettinger.
   Hal Gershman of Grand Forks, a commission member, suggested the
Grand Forks city auditorium might eventually be available to
display the quilt, if the city builds a new civic center.
   ``We envision the old auditorium being an arts center,'' he said.
   There have been plenty of ideas about what to do with the quilt
since its plight was publicized, said commission member Woody
Gagnon. One woman suggested wrapping it around the 19-story state
Capitol in Bismarck to ``save on heat bills,'' he said.

<HEAD>American Paintings of Brazil in 1864 Get First U.S. Showing Sunday</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Charles Dickens said no painter could
ever reproduce the brilliant tints of Brazilian hummingbirds, but
in 1864 American artist Martin Johnson Heade had a try. The results
get their first public showing since then at the National Gallery
of Art beginning Sunday.
   The 16 paintings Heade called ``The Gems of Brazil'' were sold
to Sir Morton Peto, a British collector, in 1865. After that, there
is no record of them until they turned up in an anonymous
collection in 1981. Soon afterwards they were bought by Richard
Manoogian, a Detroit industrialist.
   Paintings from his collection will be shown in Washington until
Sept. 4; at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco
Sept. 23-Nov. 26, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York Dec.
19 through Feb. 25, 1990 and the Detroit Institute of Arts, March
27 through May 27, 1990.
   The show is titled, ``American Paintings From the Manoogian
Collection,'' includes important works by Mary Cassatt, John Singer
Sargent, Thomas Eakins and other 19th Century American artists.
   Franklin Kelly, curator of collections at the Corcoran Art
Gallery, says Heade was the only major U.S. artist in the century
to make an important contribution to both landscape and still life,
and ``The Gems of Brazil'' include both.
   Kelly calls the paintings the most complex and ambitious of
Heade's career, which might have made him famous in this country if
they had been seen.
   Heade became interested in Brazil through a friend who was a
diplomat and an acquaintance of Brazil's last emperor, Pedro II. He
also painted a view of Rio de Janeiro, now in the Pennsylvania
Academy of Fine Arts, on the first of three trips he made to South
America.
   Pedro was interested in natural history and the arts, and Kelly
thinks he may have had something to do with the hummingbird idea.
   Heade took the paintings to Britain to get colored lithographs
made of them. A dozen years before, ornithologist John Gould had
exhibited 1,500 stuffed hummingbirds at the London Zoological
Garden. Queen Victoria said it was ``impossible to imagine anything
so lovely.''
   Dickens wrote: ``The most vivid colors of the painter's palette
cannot duplicate their ever-varying tints.''
   Heade made a try on canvas that Kelly calls among the most
original and beautiful works in 19th century American painting. But
he had to give up on the lithographs _ he could not get the colors
he wanted. The paintings were sold in London.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition politician said
Friday that President Raul Alfonsin should leave office before the
December transition date because of ``social disintegration''
marked by food rioting.
   Fourteen people were killed this week when crowds looted
supermarkets and grocery stores. Provincial and municipal
authorities have taken emergency steps to feed the needy. No
violence was reported Friday.
   Alvaro Alsogaray, an economist and leader of the center-right
Union of the Democratic Center, said Alfonsin should step down
before Dec. 10, when he is scheuled to be succeeded by
President-elect Carlos Menem of the Peronist party.
   The Peronists defeated Alfonsin's cetrist Radical Civic Union in
the May 14 national elections. The Union of the Democratic Center
finished third.
   Alsogaray, in an inteview with Radio Continental, said
Argentina's ``road is well marked: social disintegration,
dissatisfaction and anguish.''
   ``Hyperinflation that understands nothing of politics will
continue marching on its own, and the new government will find
itself confronted by a situation of great complexity.''
   Alfonsin took office in December 1983 for a six-year term
following elections that ended rule by military dictators since
1976. Alfonsin was barred by the consitution from seeking
re-election.
   He has said he would consider stepping down before Dec. 10, and
his party and the Peronists have been discussing an early transfer
of power, but they have been unable to reach an agreement.
   Some cities and town set up soup kitchens for adults and hot
lunch programs for students in an effort to head off further
violence. They also regulated supermarket prices of flour, milk,
pasta and other basic products.
   The nation remained under a state of siege, but few looting
incidents and no clashes with police were reported Friday.
   Several thousand paramilitary police remained on duty in the
northern city of Rosario, but businesses opened normally and
schools resumed classes for the first time since the Monday when
rioting broke out.
   Earlier this week the country's biggest labor union and the most
influential business group suggested Alfonsin step down early.
Ex-President Arturo Frondizi said Alfonsin should resign
immediately.
   One of the biggest obstacles to an early transfer-of-power
agreement is the economy, which for May will register an alarming
70 percent rate of inflation or higher. The beef- and
grain-exporting nation is also plagued by a budget deficit and a
$59 billion foreign debt.
   Almost daily, the austral devalues against the dollar. The
official price, set by the Central Bank on Tuesday, is 175 to 1.
However, foreign exchange houses won't sell dollars at the price,
and black market traders demanded up to 330 to 1 on Friday.
   The rate as recently as Feb. 3 was 18 to 1. It was the plunge in
value of the austral that fueled inflation and record interest
rates and touched off the economic crisis.
   The nation's biggest farm groups also have little sympathy for
Alfonsin, whose election in October 1983 replaced a brutal military
dictatorship and was expected to herald a return to prosperity as
well as democracy.
   ``The crisis is the direct consequence of a failed political
economy,'' the Rural Society group of large ranchers said in a
statement.
   In an effort to ease economic bottlenecks caused by a weeks-long
shortage of austral bills, the Central Bank issued 50,000-austral
notes Friday.
   The austral was worth $1.20 when it was introduced in June 1985.
Today it is worth less than a penny, and the 50,000-austral note is
worth $285 at the official rate. It sells for just $151 on the
black market.
   Also Friday, the United Leftist front demanded the government
lift the 30-day state of siege declared Monday and free the several
hundred people who remain in jail after being detained for looting
or allegedly provoking disturbances.

<HEAD>Vermont House Speaker Says He Hopes People Get His Name Wright</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vermont's House speaker says he isn't
concerned that Wright's wrongs may lead some to the wrong Wright.
   House Speaker Ralph Wright says he was talking with an
eighth-grader Thursday about a program for troubled youths Wright
runs in Bennington.
   ``Yeah, I've heard of you. You quit yesterday,'' the boy told
the Vermont speaker.
   No, that was Jim Wright, the speaker of the U.S. House and no
relation to Ralph. The cloud of ethics violations under which the
Texan quit has left Vermont's Wright hoping folks get it right.
   For months now, Vermont newspapers have been running headlines
saying ``Wright Under Investigation;'' ``Speaker Wright Faces
Ethics Charges;'' ``Wright Denies Wrongdoing.''
   And Ralph Wright said there undoubtedly are some Vermonters who
thought he was the one in trouble.
   Now, with Jim Wright's resignation, Ralph Wright refers to
himself as ``the last Speaker Wright left in America.'' The
National Conference of State Legislatures confimed that Ralph
Wright is now the only House speaker in the nation.
   Vermont's Wright got a chuckle in April when someone sent him a
clipping from a Maine newspaper. The Washington-datelined story
with a headline about Wright facing a troubling ethics inquiry was
accompanied by a small photograph of the Vermont speaker.
   Perhaps adding to the confusion are that both speakers are
white-haired, have a distinctive manner of speaking, frequently
wear glasses and are said to be skilled political horse-traders and
highly effective at moving their agendas.
   Sometimes the confusion has come in handy. On a trip to
Washington late last year, Wright stopped by to see David Karvelas,
the chief of staff for freshman Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt. Told that
Karvelas was in a meeting with other administrative assistants,
Wright says he got a quick response when he sent word with a page
that ``Speaker Wright'' was there to see Karvelas.
   Aside from the name confusion, Ralph Wright said of Jim Wright's
resignation, ``There's not a lot funny about it. It's sort of a
tragic thing.''
   As for any connection that voters might draw, Vermont's Wright
said, ``I don't know how much of that rubs off or lasts. It
probably doesn't amount to a hill of beans.
   ``I'll take responsibility for anything I do, but not for
anything done by somebody who by accident has the same name or the
same title.''
   One of the questionable deals pointed to by the House Ethics
Committee in the case of Texas' Wright had to do with collecting
unusually high royalties on a book sold mainly to special interest
groups.
   Vermont's Wright said he doubted he would ever get in similar
trouble. ``I wouldn't write a book,'' he said. ``Nobody would be
interested in reading it.''

   Strike-slowed Eastern Airlines said Friday it was
requiring non-union employees to work more hours for the same pay,
cutting management pay by 20 percent and eliminating vacations for
the rest of the year.
   The austerity measures were announced as a federal bankruptcy
judge in New York kept alive hopes by striking employees that the
enfeebled airline might be purchased by a friendly investor they
are backing with their own money.
   At a hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland gave the
investor group led by Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie
until 2 p.m. EDT Monday to further refine a revised buyout
proposal, based on discussions with the airline and its major
creditors.
   The proposal would make former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
chairman of the airline, Eastern's lead attorney, Harvey Miller,
told the bankruptcy hearing. Carlucci would succeed Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner for Eastern, told
Lifland he was impressed by a new version of the plan under which
Eastern's unions would give $210 million in concessions, and risk
$175 million to $200 million of their wages over six months by
paying out any excess over target expenditures set by the airline.
   ``It is an insurance policy,'' said Dan Ashby, a pilots union
spokesman. ``It's a good-faith gesture to show we want to return
Eastern to profitabiliy.''
   Eastern sought protection from creditors under the bankruptcy
laws five days after pilots and flight attendants joined its
striking Machinists union March 4, virtually grounding the airline.
   Eastern officials said the austerity program for non-union
employees, which they described as temporary, would help Eastern
emerge from bankruptcy reorganization.
   ``We're going to be as tight as we can, as lean as we can and as
productive as we can during this period,'' Thomas J. Matthews,
senior vice president for human resources. ``Probably the term that
best describes this is belt-tightening.''
   The Miami-based carrier said the changes were needed because of
financial difficulties created by the 3-month-old strike and its
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Eastern spokesman James Ashlock described the changes as
austerity measures aimed at satisfying creditors as the airline
moves ahead with its plan to reorganize as a smaller carrier.
   Under the program, full-time agents and clerical workers will be
scheduled 50 hours a week for 40 hours of pay through Dec. 1.
Management also will work at least 50 hours a week.
   Salaries of corporate officers, including Eastern President Phil
Bakes, will be reduced 20 percent through the end of the year and
10 percent for the first six months of 1990.
   No vacations will be allowed through the end of the year, and no
vacation credit will be accrued from March to December of this year.
   The company's proposals for pilots and flight attendants will be
discussed when negotiations with the unions representing those
groups resume next week, Matthews said.
   Eastern is operating with 4,500 to 5,000 employees, most of them
in management positions, down from 30,000 before the strike.

   Some Bible readers soon will be putting batteries
in the Good Book: an electronic version of the Scriptures delivered
by a new hand-held computer.
   ``It is lighter and smaller than most printed Bibles, and it
allows you to find a particular passage in just seconds,'' Lisa
Goorfin, marketing director for Franklin Computer of Mt. Holly,
N.J., said Friday.
   The company introduced its new HOLY BIBLE computer at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago this week.
   The computer, 5.6 inches square and weighing 13 ounces, will be
available around Christmas for $299 in either King James or revised
standard versions, said Ms. Goorfin. It will include the Old
Testament and the New Testament.
   The computer, which took two years to develop, operates on four
AA batteries.
   The HOLY BIBLE can be read as a book or used to identify a
specific Scripture by typing in a few key words, she said. For
example, entering the words ``valley, shadow, death'' will prompt
the computer to respond with the 23rd Psalm.
   The computer includes a thesaurus so that it can find the
correct passage even if the user does not know the exact words used
in the passage. A phonetic spelling feature allows the user to type
the word the way it sounds, even if that spelling is incorrect.
   ``The Bible is the most popular book in the world, and our new
computer is geared to anyone who might read it,'' said Ms. Goorfin.
   Clergymen said the computer could help people study the Bible,
and, perhaps, encourage interest in Scriptures, by the younger
generation.
   ``We're in the 20th century and this makes the word of God
relevant to a technological society,'' said the Rev. Donald Sharp,
pastor of Faith Tabernacle Baptist Church in Chicago. ``It is still
the Good Book.''
   The Rev. Edward Barrett, pastor of Immaculate Conception
Catholic Church in Waukegan, said he did not think the computer
version of the Bible would replace the written one, but might help
people's understanding.
   The Rev. Duane Pederson, pastor of Edison Park Lutheran Church,
said it might take time for the electronic version of the Bible to
catch on in churches.
   ``The image of the Bible is a book,'' he said. ``For a preacher
to stand up and hold a computer and read from it doesn't have the
same kind of impact.
   ``But God's word is larger than a computer chip or a printed
page,'' he added. ``The vehicle of God's word makes no difference
to me.''

   Three reputed drug gang members should be
spared from the electric chair and sentenced to life in prison for
murdering four people in a crack cocaine war, a jury recommended
Friday.
   The defendants, all from Miami, were convicted Thursday in the
murders of three men and a woman whose naked bodies were found
Sept. 20 at a home in suburban Pleasant Grove. The attackers bound
and gagged the victims before shooting them in the head and
slashing their throats.
   The jury that convicted the defendants after 10 hours of
deliberations took 50 minutes to decide to recommend life without
parole for at least 25 years for Timothy ``Red'' Robinson, 22, and
Michael ``Mac'' Coleman, 27. Each had been found guilty of four
first-degree murder counts.
   Six of the 12 jurors voted for the death penalty, but that fell
short of the needed majority.
   The vote was 11-1 for the same life sentence in the case of
Darrell ``Yoge'' Frazier, 25, found guilty of one first-degree
murder count and three counts of second-degree murder.
   Circuit Judge Nicholas Geeker is not bound by the jury's
recommendations. He set a sentencing hearing for July 25 so lawyers
can make arguments to him.
   Assistant State Attorney Michael Patterson would not comment.
The prosecutor had recommended death for all three defendants,
telling jurors it was a cold, calculated, premeditated crime for
money.
   Mothers of all three defendants appealed to the jury for mercy.
   ``Of all the evidence and testimony I've heard, nobody's
testified Darrell killed anyone,'' his mother, Alma Frazier, told
jurors. ``I don't believe he could have killed anyone.''
   She revealed that another son, Bruce ``Jit'' Frazier, 21, a
fugitive in the case, phoned her two months ago.
   ``I told him to turn himself in,'' Ms. Frazier said. ``Everyone
wants to see it come to an end. It's like a nightmare.''
   All three mothers said their sons had tough childhoods in
Miami's Liberty City, an impoverished black neighborhood agitated
by racial disturbances four times in the 1980s.
   Mary Robinson painted a picture of a chaotic family life,
raising seven children with little support from an abusive husband
she eventually divorced.
   Dolly Leverson said her son Coleman was considered a top
basketball prospect but dropped out of school after the 10th grade.
She said she did not believe he committed the murders because in
previous brushes with the law he had always admitted his
involvement, but this time he has maintained his innocence.
   Coleman was the only defendant to testify during the sentencing
hearing.
   ``I still say I did not commit any crime, as God is my
witness,'' Coleman said. He noted genetic tests failed to link him
with the rapes of two victims, one of whom survived the attack.
   Coleman and Robinson were convicted of two rape charges. Each
defendant also was convicted of one count of attempted murder, six
of kidnapping, one of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, two of
robbery and one of breaking and entering.

   Ten people were killed, including a child hit
by a stray bullet, and four policemen were wounded in guerrilla
attacks throughout Peru on Thursday and Friday, authorities said.
   Police said members of the Mao-inspired Shining Path group
overran a peasant community in an attack Thursday in the Andean
mining state of Pasco, 115 miles northeast of Lima, and killed two
village officials and two other people.
   In a nearby community, two guerrillas died in a shootout with a
military patrol and a child was killed by a stray shot, authorities
said.
   One policeman was killed and four were wounded in an attack by
insurgents early Friday on a police outpost in Aija, 160 miles
north of Lima in Ancash state, a mountainous area frequented by
foreign backpackers. A state bank and municipal buildings were
bombed in the attack.
   In Lima, a street vendor was killed Thursday night when caught
in a cross fire between police and guerrillas who were trying to
set fire to buses in a plaza.
   Twelve miles north of the capital, insurgents set fire to a bus
after forcing the passengers and driver to get off.
   A police sergeant was shot dead on the street Friday by leftist
guerrillas who fired from the back of a passing pickup truck in a
Lima suburb.
   A leftist insurgency has sundered Peru since the Shining Path
took up arms against the government in 1980, with more than 14,000
people killed.

<TEXT>
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei on Friday
indicated a need to check population growth but he did not advocate
birth control _ an issue that has sparked debate among Iran's
Moslem theologians.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Khamenei as
telling thousands of people at the weekly prayer meeting in Tehran,
``Don't make an excuse of the Prophet (Mohammed) if you want to
have more children.''
   He said Islam initially encouraged large families because there
were only about 100,000 people in the Arabian peninsula, where the
religion was founded.
   ``But this does not mean that for the rest of history every
Moslem family is obliged to have 8, 10 or 12 children,'' he said.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, also said the government was trying
to encourage people to use contraceptives, but there is no national
plan to reduce the birthrate. Iran's annual population growth of
3.7 percent is among the highest in the world.
   The agency quoted Khamenei as saying he would not ``reject or
insist on'' birth control.
   IRNA said Iran's population now exceeds 50 million and it is
expected to double in 20 years.
   Supporters and opponents of birth control have debated the issue
in the news media.
   Some theologians said the government could implement controls
without violating Islamic law. They said the Koran calls on people
to achieve happiness, and if contraception is a way to gain
happiness it is permissible.
   Others arued that contraception is against the will of God on
grounds the birth of a child is an act of God.

<HEAD>Reaction Mixed to Lukens' Decision to Stay in Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens' decision to
stay in office despite being convicted of having sex with a
teen-age girl drew mixed reactions in his hometown Friday but did
not surprise state political leaders.
   ``I think it's ludicrous on his behalf to think that the public
... still trusts him,'' said Ron Shumard, a Republican from
Middletown. ``The public trust and his behavior are not compatible
for him to carry on that kind of office.''
   Lukens said in a statement Friday he would retain his seat as he
fights the misdemeanor conviction of contributing to the
delinquency and unruliness of a minor.
   Declaring ``I am now fighting for my political life,'' the
58-year-old Republican said he would not allow ``the lies and
deceit of one delinquent individual'' to ruin him.
   Lukens, who is divorced, was convicted of having sex at his
Columbus apartment on Nov. 6 with a girl who was then 16. He faces
sentencing this month in Franklin County Domestic Relations Court,
but is appealing the verdict.
   ``I don't think he should be left in there at all,'' said David
Lenharr of Middletown, who described himself as a Democrat but said
he has voted Republican in the past. ``He don't deserve to
represent our district.''
   But Joe Ferguson, another Democrat, said the congressman should
not be forced to step down.
   ``He ain't done more than a lot of other guys have done,''
Ferguson said. ``He just happened to get caught. I don't hold that
against him.''
   On Thursday, Ohio GOP Chairman Robert Bennett and GOP leaders
from Lukens' district joined in a call for the congressman to
resign.
   ``I think he is a bad apple for the Republican Party,'' Bennett
said. ``He has lost the support of the entire Republican leadership
of his district.''
   Bennett said the party has no power to forcehis resignation, but
can withhold its support if he seeks re-election in 1990.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Columbus, the senior Republican in Ohio's
congressional delegation, repeated a call he made hours after
Lukens' conviction last Friday for Lukens to ``do the gentlemanly
thing and resign.''
   ``He's just prolonging the agony. That cannot help the interest
of the institution of Congress or `Buz' Lukens,'' Wylie said.
   Wylie said he had been told by a House Ethics Committee member
last week that the panel would take up the matter of Lukens
conviction. Wylie declined to identify the member.
   Donald Birgel, chairman of the Butler County GOP in Lukens' home
county, said Lukens' announcement was predictable.
   ``The issue is the people of this congressional district want a
certain morality level of all the political leaders. Eeverything
involved in this case is not an acceptable level of morality for a
congressman and that's why we feel he should resign.''
   Birgel added, however, that calling for Lukens' resignation ``is
the most distasteful thing I've ever had to do in my adult life.
It's depressing.''

<TEXT>
   While thousands of Republicans flock to Bush
administration jobs in Washington, workers on Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis' presidential campaign have been scattered by their
candidate's defeat seven months ago.
   Most of the top staffers have landed jobs to match their
experience. But for some the job search has been frustrating.
   On Friday, former campaign manager Susan Estrich was delivering
the commencement address at Wellesley College. Top aide John Sasso
worked for his six-figure salary at a Boston advertising firm. And
master fund-raiser Robert Farmer was in the midst of his usual
12-hour day raising money for the Democratic National Committee and
working for a top Washington lobbyist.
   Some former aides, however, worry about the break-up of the
Dukakis-Democrat family. They say more has to be done by the DNC to
keep the troops who ran the campaign a viable force.
   ``The Republicans have a tradition of taking care of their
own,'' said Leslie Dach, former communications director for the
Dukakis campaign. ``I don't think you see that'' on the Democratic
side.
   ``There's no feeling out there that the people who gave months
or years of their lives to elect a Democratic president should be
helped or rewarded,'' said Dach, who works as public affairs
director for Edelman Public Relations in Washington, D.C.
   Washington, Harvard University and the Dukakis gubernatorial
administration appear to be the most common receiving grounds for
former campaign staffers. Jack Corrigan and Stephen Rosenfeld, who
held top campaign positions, are back as top aides to the governor,
whose popularity has suffered in recent months. Mindy Lubber, who
handled scheduling for the Dukakis campaign, is now press secretary.
   Jack Weeks, the gregarious ex-boxer who handled press and
advance work for Dukakis and _ rightly or wrongly _ was blamed for
setting up the famous tank photo opportunity that went so badly,
now is an administrator for the state Department of Public Works.
And former campaign spokesman Mark Gearan is back in his old job as
the governor's federal state relations liaison.
   In Washington, Paul Tully, who made headlines for his
participation in the videotape incident that resulted in U.S. Sen.
Joseph Biden's withdrawal from the presidential primaries, now
works as a policy director for the Democratic National Committee.
   Sasso, who left the Dukakis campaign following the Biden
incident and then returned in the final months, enjoys relaxing.
   ``On Sundays instead of rushing to get up early to read all the
papers and watch all the Sunday shows, now I decide where my son
Robert and I should go fishing,'' he said.
   Susan Brophy, who went from delegate coordinator for Dukakis to
congressional staffer for U.S. Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., agrees
that the losing party in a presidential race must struggle to keep
its operatives involved. For her own part, Brophy says she feels
obligated to work for a Democrat in the 1992 presidential race.
   ``But I would never quit my job and go work on a presidential
campaign again,'' she said.
   Says Dach, ``There are only so many doughnuts you can eat and
only so many leaves of absence you can get from your kids and your
wife before you realize you've had enough.''
   Estrich, who is returning to her Harvard Law School
professorship after a vacation at a Mexican health spa, was the
first woman to manage a major presidential campaign. She praised
Dukakis for giving women leadership roles in politics.
   ``But the closer we got to November, the fewer women in the
room. Most of the old hands were male hands,'' Estrich said.
   Although campaign bigwigs have secure jobs, others are finding
some employers unimpressed with the Dukakis campaign experience on
their resumes.
   ``I have friends still out of work who run into that attitude,''
said one former staffer, who asked not to be named. ``It comes with
the territory of being defeated. It seems to put a tag on you.''

   WASHINGTON (ap) _ Former First Lady Nancy Reagan was welcomed
back to Washington for the first time Friday with a shower of hugs,
kisses and friendly barbs about ``the good old days'' from friends
and former staffers.
   Dressed in a signature red Aldofo dress, but arriving bit late
without the crack advance team that had once plotted her every
move, Mrs. Reagan attended an elegant afternoon tea party, eager to
catch up on the four months that have gone by since she and
President Reagan bid Washington adieu.
   ``I've got a big scoop for you _ I've gained four pounds!'' the
still-thin Mrs. Reagan exclaimed to one reporter as she swept
through the group of well-wishers.
   Mrs. Reagan was in Washington to address a Library of Congress
symposium on first ladies' memoirs, and she promised that her own
book _ expected out in the fall _ will be a page-turner.
   ``I'm going to say everything I couldn't say for eight years,''
she vowed.
   Sporting her Secret Service nickname ``Rainbow'' on her shoulder
identification tag, the former first lady worked the crowd of about
100 with old-time political savvy, sharing lengthy hugs and
animated conversations with many, among them her former maid, Anita
Costelo.
   She assured those present that she and the former president
``absolutely'' love their California life, and that they are both
``wonderful.''
   But it is a different world. With a mischevious grin, Mrs.
Reagan confessed to a group of reporters, ``I even miss you.''
   Among those present was a long list of former staff members,
including first hairdresser Robin Weir, chiefs of staff Joe Canzeri
and Jim Rosebush, social secretaries Linda Faulkner and Mabel
Brandon, press secretaries Elaine Crispen and Jennefer Hirshberg,
personal secretary Jane Erckenbeck, speechwriter Landon Parvin and
press aides Wendy Weber Toler and Betsy Koons.
   Mrs. Crispen said the fest was partly devised as a reunion, and
partly to celebrate the first lady's July 6 birthday, and who was
counting which one?
   Her nebulous age in the White House _ in fact, she will be 68
next month _ was the stuff of gentle ribbing.
   Washington Post reporter Donnie Radcliffe welcomed Mrs. Reagan
on behalf of her former press corps, recalling those days when
journalists bore in on her image as a clothes horse, high-priced
china purchaser and White House decorator extraordinaire.
   ``Who would have ever thought eight years ago, we'd be talking
about the good old days?'' Ms. Radcliffe quipped, evoking an
energetic and affirmative nod from Mrs. Reagan.
   The reporter reminded Mrs. Reagan that she'd ``always acted your
age _ when you could decide what it would be'' and of the times
when ``you couldn't do a thing with your hair because it messed up
your crown.''
   Mrs. Reagan's alleged influence in high-stakes foreign policy
wasn't ignored, nor was her grand rivalry with Soviet first lady
Raisa Gorbachev.
   Ms. Radcliffe kidded Mrs. Reagan that after her famous
tete-a-tete with Soviet foreign minister Andre Gromyko, the
official had ``gone right home and told Raisa about it, which is
why you became such good friends.''
   CBS White House correspondent Jacqueline Adams added that
reporters really did miss Mrs. Reagan's backstage talents for
dealing with troublesome White House appointees _ ``especially at
the time of John Tower.''
   At that, Mrs. Reagan laughed so hard she hid her face in her
hands.
   Ms. Radcliffe also advised Mrs. Reagan that the group had
arranged a VIP tour of the Bush White House for her _ ``but we
figured you didn't need any more pictures of you bouncing on the
Lincoln bed.''
   And the assembly had intended to get a present for her, ``but
they were all out of puppies,'' Ms. Radcliffe joked in a reference
to a current preoccupation of the new first lady, Barbara Bush.
   After Mrs. Reagan was presented with a small, needlepointed
pillow adorned with her ``Rainbow,'' nickname, she assured the
group:
   ``I've missed all of you. We both have. It's wonderful to be in
our own home, but if you miss us, that's nice too.''

<HEAD>Group Claims Responsibility for `Cyprus Operation'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIAD KAHWAJI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A previously unknown group claimed
responsibility Friday for a plan to shoot down a helicopter
carrying Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun to Cyprus.
   ``The March 14 organization announces its responsibility for the
operation our six strugglers arrested in Cyprus recruited
themselves to accomplish,'' said a statement delivered to the
privately owned Sohofia news agency in west Beirut.
   Six Lebanese were arrested in Cyprus' south coast tourist resort
of Larnaca on May 26 and on Monday, after two scuba divers came
across two Soviet-made SA-7 missiles and their launchers in
watertight packing off the coast.
   Aoun, 54, who also heads a Christian military Cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government, had been expecting an invitation to
attend last week's Arab summit conference in Casablanca, Morocco.
   He would have been likely to travel by helicopter from his
blockaded Christian enclave to Larnaca to catch a flight to
Casablanca, but the invitation never materialized.
   The March 14 organization apparently was named after the date
Aoun's gunners based around Yarze pounded mostly Moslem west Beirut
for the first time in one of the heaviest barrages unleashed during
an 11-week confrontation with Syrian troops and Druse Moslem
militiamen.
   By police count, 39 people died in the March 14 shelling duels.
A total of 360 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded in
the latest round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   There was no way of authenticating the typewritten Arabic
statement saying the six Lebanese detained in Cyprus planned to
``execute the just verdict of the people against Yarze's butcher
Michel Aoun ... for the massacre he committed on March 14.''
   Aoun's headquarters were in the Defense Ministry compound at
suburban Yarze, five miles east of Beirut, when the artillery
battles erupted March 8.
   In Friday's statement to Sohofia, a non-partisan local news
agency specializing in Lebanese affairs, the March 14 organization
described itself as a ``group of nationalist unionist non-sectarian
strugglers.''
   The six Lebanese are being held in Nicosia, the Cypriot capital,
on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and illegal possession of
arms and explosives.
   Aoun is opposed by the rival Moslem Cabinet of Acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss. The two Lebanese governments _ have been
contesting power since September, when outgoing President Amin
Gemayel named Aoun to head a temporary military Cabinet to rule
pending Parliament's election of a new head of state.
   Syria, which keeps 40,000 troops in neighboring Lebanon under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, considers the country within
its sphere of influence and backs the Hoss government.

   A preliminary hearing in the ``Cotton Club''
murder case was halted Friday after the star witness blurted out
surprise details of defendants' alleged confessions, prompting
defense attorneys to cry foul.
   The witness, William Rider, said two defendants bragged about
killing producer Roy Radin and one of them said, ``He enjoyed
shooting the big fat Jew.''
   The lawyers accused prosecutors of purposely hiding the
incriminating statements, which had to be disclosed under
California discovery laws. Deputy District Attorney David Conn
insisted that he had disclosed ``the gist of the statements,'' but
Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo McKay said that was not enough.
   She stopped testimony and ordered prosecution investigators to
appear in court Monday to reveak what they know about Rider's
planned testimony. If more is uncovered, she said she would grant
the defense a continuance to prepare.
   Rider, whose previous disclosures triggered the filing of
charges in the six-year-old murder, is considered the prosecution's
most important witness. He ties defendants Alex Lamota Marti and
William Molony Mentzer to the actual killing and implicates chief
defendant Karen DeLayne Greenberger.
   The prosecution contends Mrs. Greenberger, a reputed drug
dealer, arranged Radin's murder after they fought about her share
of profits from ``The Cotton Club.'' She had introduced Radin to
former Paramount Pictures chief Robert Evans, who was dealing with
Radin in his attempts to finance the film.
   In Rider's earlier statements, he also said he was told that
Evans was involved in the Radin slaying.
   Rider, who was chief of security for Hustler Magazine publisher
Larry Flynt, said he had hired Mentzer and Marti as bodyguards. He
said both men boasted to him in May or June of 1983 about the Radin
murder.
   In June, he said, Mentzer and Marti brought him a newspaper
article about the discovery of Radin's body, said it proved they
were telling the truth and offered more details.
   ``Mr. Marti said that in reference to Mr. Mentzer getting the
courage to shoot Mr. Radin, that he had to drink a bottle of wine
before. Mr. Marti shot first and emptied his gun into Mr. Radin and
Mr. Mentzer followed suit,'' said Rider.
   ``What else did Mr. Marti say?'' asked Deputy District Attorney
David Conn.
   ``Just that he hated Jews and he enjoyed shooting the big fat
Jew,'' said Rider.
   Judge McKay had ordered that every person entering the courtroom
be searched before Rider, who is Flynt's former brother-in-law,
arrived with his retinue of burly bodyguards.
   The halt in testimony came on the same day that former TV star
Demond Wilson contradicted his earlier testimony, denying that
Radin had expressed fear of danger because of his involvement in
``The Cotton Club.''
   Wilson's startling flip-flop came moments before he ended three
days on the stand. After Wilson left, Mrs. Greenberger's attorney,
Edward Shohat, asked the judge to throw out the actor's testimony.
   ``You're dealing with a witness who would say anything that's
convenient at the time,'' he said. But the judge denied the motion.
   Wilson, the former star of TV's ``Sanford and Son,'' was one of
the last people to see Radin alive. He testified Wednesday that
Radin, a New York theatrical producer, expressed fear for his life
because of negotiations to finance the movie.
   ``He asked me to follow and just watch and see if anything
happened,'' Wilson said then. ``He said that there might be some
trouble. He said that something might happen to him as a result of
his association with the film thing ... `The Cotton Club.'''
   But Wilson changed that account Friday.
   Under rapid fire cross-examination by attorney David Kenner,
Wilson said: ``I didn't hear him talk about `The Cotton Club.'''
Then he amended his remark, saying: ``I had heard him talk about it
but it was a pipe dream. He was talking about a film. Sometimes
films weren't even named.''
   Also charged in the case is Robert Ulmer Lowe, who is fighting
extradition in Maryland.

   A man who said he began by shooting at
streetlights but switched to people when it ``got boring'' was
convicted Friday in a series of snipings that terrorized
communities in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
   A Superior Court jury found Russell J. Ducharme II guilty on 30
of 36 counts, including eight counts of assault with intent to
commit murder and seven counts of conspiracy to commit murder
during late 1986 and early 1987.
   He was also found guilty of a series of arsons and break-ins in
the summer of 1987.
   He faces a maximum sentence of two life terms in prison plus 355
years.
   Ducharme, 25, of Smithfield was acquitted of six charges,
including four counts of breaking and entering, one count of first
degree arson and one count of stealing a firearm.
   Ducharme and his companion, Peter T. Trepanier, 25, of
Burrillville, began shooting at streetlights, but switched to
shooting at people after that ``got boring,'' Ducharme said during
the 16-day trial.
   Four people were injured in the attacks along the border of
Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which ended only after Gov. Edward
DiPrete called out the National Guard to patrol the area.
   Judge Dominic Cresto continued bail at $520,000 with surety. No
sentencing date was set. Trepanier was convicted in February on
similar counts and awaits sentencing.
   Cresto set a June 21 hearing on motions for a new trial.
   The verdict came late in the fourth day of deliberations, after
Cresto denied a motion for a mistrial.
   ``We're tired and we're satisfied,'' said prosecuting attorney
Eva Marie Mancuso. Defense attorney J. Joseph Nugent declined to
comment.
   At trial, Nugent contended that police improperly coerced a
confession in which Ducharme admitted he and his friend were
responsible for the shootings, housebreaks and arsons.
   Ducharme was arrested Oct. 8, 1987, after Trepanier walked into
the Woonsocket police station and confessed.

   High wind described as a small twister
swept through the city center Friday, crushing a woman to death
under a church steeple, injuring several other people and knocking
down trees and power lines. ``It's an ugly scene. There are wires
down all over the place,'' said Mayor Jeffrey A. Bean.
   A housing complex for 200 elderly residents was evacuated
because of structural damage, Bean said.
   Sandra R. Cressey, 53, of Fitchburg was in her car when it was
``literally crushed'' by a wooden steeple that fell from the First
Parish Unitarian Universalist Church, said Vicky Greene, a nursing
supervisor at Burbank Hospital.
   Cressey was pronounced dead at the hospital, where she had
worked for more than 20 years as a director of clinical services,
said hospital spokesman James Leach.
   A mother and her three children were in another car that was hit
by the steeple, but left Burbank Hospital without being treated,
Greene said.
   A church spire atop the Faith United Church also toppled,
sending chunks of brownstone from the church flying into the
street. Both churches are within 150 yards of each other on the
Fitchburg common.
   Fire officials said other people were trapped in cars by a maze
of fallen wires in the center of this largely working class city of
39,000 people 45 miles west of Boston.
   A 19-year-old man and a 24-year-old man were treated and
released for injuries sustained from debris flying in the air, said
Vicky Greene, a Burbank nursing administrator. She said a
3-year-old boy, who was in a car with his father when a branch hit
their windshield, caught a piece of glass in his eye.
   Mark Romano, 28, said he saw a 400- to 500-pound dumpster lifted
30 feet off the ground and deposited 25 feet away from its original
spot in the Congregational Church parking lot next to his house.
   Then, Romano said, he saw the black funnel-shaped cloud touch
down on one of the church steeples, pull it off and dump it on a
parked car nearby.
   Fire officials, the Fitchburg Civil Defense Office and witnesses
reported seeing a small twister touch down amid torrential rain
Friday afternoon.
   A National Weather Service spokesman in Boston said the nature
of the storm was still being investigated Friday night.
   Earlier, Gene Auciello, meteorologist at the weather service
office at Boston's Logan International Airport, said it was
unlikely a tornado had struck.
   He said the wind blast was probably a downburst from severe
thunderstorms passing through the state. Storms were developing
along a cold front curving through the Northeast.
   Fitchburg and nearby Gardner, which also suffered downed trees
and wires in winds clocked at up to 80 mph, declared a state of
emergency, said Douglas Forbes of the Massachusetts Civil Defense
Agency.

   Both sides in the abortion battle are squaring
off over a ``morning after'' abortion pill that is available in
France but not in the United States.
   Officials of national Right to Life said they are prepared to
encourage a boycott of products distributed by an American
affiliate of the French manufacturer of the pill if there is an
attempt to license the drug in the United States.
   And on the other side, leaders of the National Organization for
Women and the Fund for the Feminist Majority call such tactics
``medical McCarthyism'' and are preparing to lobby federal health
officials and commercial drug companies to start American testing
of the abortion pill.
   The drug, called RU486, is now being used for about 15 percent
of the elective abortions in France and is being studied for the
treatment of certain diseases. RU486 has not been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration for distribution in the United States.

   John E. List's first life as a church-going

slayings of his mother, wife and three children in their Victorian
mansion.
   His second, almost parallel existence ended Thursday when FBI
agents arrested List in an accounting office in Richmond, Va.,
wrapping up a search that had led to all 50 states, Europe and
South America.
   The arrest came 11 days after Fox television network's
``America's Most Wanted'' program broadcast details of List's case.
   The show re-enacted the slayings, and displayed photos of List
from before the killings and a sculptor's bust of how he might look
today. One viewer called to say a man resembling List was living in
the Richmond suburb of Midlothian, the FBI said.

<HEAD>Papandreou Fights For Political Life in June 18 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK QUINN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swept into power eight years ago promising
radical changes for Greece, Premier Andreas Papandreou is battling
for his political survival in elections June 18.
   The 70-year-old leader is beset by allegations of widespread
corruption among senior members of his ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) and accusations that he failed to implement many
socialist reforms he espoused when first elected in 1981.
   He's also in the midst of divorcing his American-born wife of 38
years to take up with a former airline stewardess half his age.
   But friends and foes alike admit that Papandreou, an economics
professor in the United States before returning to political life
in Greece, is far from beaten. He still retains an oratorical flair
and personal appeal that gave him 48 percent of the popular vote in
1981 and 46 percent in 1985.
   Papandreou is banking on support from Greece's rural areas,
where socialist policies have had more success than in the cities.
   ``Socialism, democracy, patriotism, peace, these were the goals
of the popular movement in our country,'' he told a recent rally.
``PASOK continues this popular movement today. Our enemy is not the
left, it is the right.''
   Opposition parties claim Papandreou has ignored many of the
accusations against him and tried instead to polarize the
electorate.
   He has also skirted the issue of his personal life, choosing
instead to allow his live-in companion, 35-year-old Dimitra Liani,
to accompany him on campaign trips.
   Papandreou's open affair with Ms. Liani has hurt his personal
popularity, but public interest in the relationship seems to be
dying down.
   ``People are tired about hearing about his personal life. People
want to talk about economic and social issues, people want to know
what's happening,'' said Theodoros Pangalos, deputy foreign
minister and a member of PASOK's executive council.
   Papandreou has said his affair with Ms. Liani hurt his standing
in the polls but added that he made it public because he was
committed to the tall blonde.
   ``I knew this would have a cost. But it was not a passing thing.
It was a relationship, it was a way of life,'' he said in an
interview with a Greek newspaper.
   He has also speeded up the divorce suit filed against his wife
Margaret, 66, in hopes of having it over with and, PASOK sources
say, to marry Ms. Liani before the elections.
   He has been married to the former Margaret Chant, of Elmhurst,
Ill., since 1951. They have four children and two grandchildren.
One of the children, 37-year-old George Papandreou, is a PASOK
member of Parliament. Mrs. Papandreou still lives in Greece.
   To improve his image and pick up support from leftist voters,
Papandreou has also promised to submit any agreement in current
negotiations on the future of four U.S. military bases in Greece to
a national referendum if he wins the elections.
   But economic problems and a seesawing foreign policy have eroded
popular support for the Socialists.
   Greece's response to international terrorism has also angered
some of the country's NATO allies. In December, the government
freed and put on a plane to Libya a Palestinian wanted by Italy for
a 1982 bomb attack against Rome's main synagogue that killed a
child. There have also been repeated delays in extraditing
suspected terrorist to the United States.
   Allegations of involvement in a multimillion dollar scandal
surrounding fugitive Greek banker George Koskotas has tested the
premier's appeal.
   Koskotas fled Greece in November after being indicted in a $200
million-fraud forgery and embezzlement scandal. Koskotas, the
chairman of the Bank of Crete, was arrested in the United States
and is jailed in Salem, Mass., awaiting an extradition hearing.
   He has alleged in interviews from jail that Papandreou and other
senior Socialist officials were given millions of dollars in
payoffs and authorized the looting of his bank.
   Papandreou, in turn, has accused the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency and the ``American establishment'' of trying to orchestrate
his political demise.
   The main conservative opposition New Democracy Party, led by
Constantine Mitsotakis, has been hammering away at the government's
handling of the Koskotas scandal since it first surfaced more than
eight months ago.
   Although New Democracy leads PASOK by about 7 percentage points
in recent public opinion polls and is favored to win a majority in
the 300-member single chamber parliament, political analysts say
the 70-year-old Mitsotakis falls short against Papandreou in
popularity.
   This stems from his failure to defeat Papandreou in the 1985
elections and from from his alleged involvement in a series of
political intrigues in the mid-1960s. The socialists claim these
intrigues paved the way for the 1967-74 military dictatorship.

<HEAD>Rice to Roses: Life of Japanese Farmers Changing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAMAGATA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As spring moves toward summer, some
Japanese farmers are tending rosebushes instead of transplanting
rice seedlings in fields now in retirement after centuries of rice
cultivation.
   The government-subsidized shift from traditional rice into
fruits, vegetables and flowers has rescued some farmers whose
fields were too small to provide a livable income from rice.
   Flooded rice paddies here in Yamagata prefecture now are watery
mirrors reflecting the steep mountains of northern Japan.
   Even so, Japan still grows more rice than it eats, and the
farmers still have a long list of complaints _ chiefly, foreign
competition. For one thing, the United States is pressuring the
government to allow the import of U.S. rice, which would cost
Japanese consumers less than their homegrown variety.
   ``When I started farming when I was 18, I did not feel
threatened that much by foreign competition,'' said Yuichi Kuroda,
41. ``It has just been the last few years I have felt threatened by
produce from abroad.''
   Kuroda converted his 2.7-acre farm from rice to tomatoes,
flowers, organically grown spinach and other vegetables raised in
plastic greenhouses, and thus isn't worried about rice imports.
   But when he goes to the supermarket, he sees asparagus, pumpkins
and kiwi fruits from Mexico, the Philippines and New Zealand.
   ``I do feel a lot of competition,'' he said.
   Rice cultivation was relatively stable, Kuroda said, as the
government buys any farmer's output at a subsidized price, while he
has to sell his own produce now at prices set by auction.
   A few miles away, Masayoshi Goto still grows rice. He was in
muddy boots as he supervised his 19-year-old son, Naoto, operating
an ingenious machine that takes pads of rice seedlings, feeds them
into rows of wheels and plops them in neat lines in the flooded
paddy.
   The $11,000 motorized transplanting machine, though not in use
by all farmers, reduces the physical agony of bent-over
hand-transplanting that causes ``farmer's disease'' _ permanently
bent backs seen on many older people in Yamagata.
   About 80 percent of rice farms in Japan are 2.5 acres or
smaller, and the owners usually are part-time farmers with another
steady job. But Goto owns 11.2 acres and harvests an additional 8.6
acres of leased land, making him a full-time farmer.
   He said the international pressure on rice had moved him to
convert some land to cherry trees.
   His son, Naoto, is a student at an agriculture college and will
take over the farm, but Goto said, ``As a father, I have second
thoughts about telling my son to succeed to my farm.''
   Asked how he would react if the government decided to permit
some rice imports, he said, ``I don't want it to happen, but if it
does, we would try to produce more top-quality rice.''
   Quality goes into growing cherries, too.
   Kenjiro Kikuchi, 52, has converted half of his five acres from
rice to cherries in the early 1970s and said he earned much more
than before.
   His trees thrive in tents of plastic over metal-tube frames to
keep rain from bruising the cherries. The ground is covered with
metallic foil to reflect light on to the bottom of the cherries so
they ripen uniformly. A heater in the tent keeps the temperature
right. Kikuchi said only organic fertilizer was used.
   The result: a subtly delicious, firm, evenly red cherries that
sell for 86 cents each, the kind that well-heeled Japanese buy in
boxes of 100 as gifts.
   Such expensive produce has helped make Yamagata a prosperous,
stable city of 250,000 people.
   Greenhouses have altered the classic countryside, supplanting
rectangular rice paddies with an industrial look, nowhere more
evident than in a rose-growing operation that burns old tires to
heat the glass-enclosed greenhouses.
   Kouji Takeda, 27, said his family had converted from rice to
roses about 10 years ago when it seemed quite a risk, ``but now I
think it was a good decision. Now we make a better living.''
   His mother Kimiko agreed: ``From a woman's point of view,
growing roses is more pleasant than growing rice.''

<HEAD>Why People Don't Save</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the White House and probably in your house,
as well as on Wall Street and in academia, the question is the
same: Why don't Americans save more of their paychecks?
   If the Japanese and Italians can save double-digit percentages
of income, why is it that American workers, some of whom work
second jobs and also benefit from working spouses, saved on average
less than 5 percent of their income last year?
   The answer isn't made any clearer by results of a Purdue
University professor's studies, which show that families in which
one or both spouses work a second, moonlight job still are apt to
have problems putting money away.
   ``You would think that married couples where each spouse has a
job should be able to get by comfortably without taking on extra
work,'' says Professor A. Charlene Sullivan. But, she says, it
isn't always so.
   Her studies suggest but leave unanswered an intriguing
consideration. It is difficult to tell from her research, she says,
if households work extra hours to pay existing debts or if they
take on extra work to raise living standards.
   In analyzing data on 600 married couples, Sullivan found a
tendency for some of those with dual and extra incomes to live
beyond their means, to feel they have too much debt and to say
credit cards do more harm than good.
   In such feelings is a suggestion that the savings problem lies
as much in the psyche as in the paycheck, as much in understanding
human expectations as in understanding needs, as much in the study
of psychology as of economics.
   But even greater insight into the phenomenon might be obtained
by analyzing the ingenious American marketing techniques, which day
and night direct an incessant barrage of stimuli at the consumer.
Buy, buy, buy.
   The barrage conditions the targets, makes them view themselves
as buyers rather than savers. Evidence of this is reflected in such
statements as ``I must turn in my car _ it's four years old,'' or
``This is our first house; we'll move up to something bigger in a
couple of years.''
   The dazzling image of a ``better'' life is forever before
Americans. A new kitchen, a better vacation, an ingenious
electronic gadget you simply cannot do without. In fact, a new you,
via vitamins and a health club membership.
   Of course, this scenario doesn't fit millions of Americans
fighting to make ends meet on inadequate incomes. They fail to save
because medical care costs so much, because rents are so high,
because food prices won't fall.
   And it must be observed that the savings rate problem is more
complex than it might appear, involving such seemingly disparate
matters as the U.S. budget deficit, Federal Reserve policy and the
price of imported oil.
   But it is obvious that for millions of Americans the failure to
save isn't because they earn so little, but because they feel
compelled to spend so much, urged on by the ever-present reminder
that a ``better'' life can be theirs.
   Now, not later. Life is to be lived at this moment, not in some
vague and distant future. Once it was a fight to keep up with the
Joneses, but these days even the Joneses are made to appear stodgy
by the latest magazine spread.
   Easy credit paves the road and brings the vague future from way
out there to right here now, crystal clear. No longer need you

   HBO's new anthology series, ``Tales from the
Crypt,'' might be based on comic-book stories from the 1940s and
1950s, but it is definitely not for kids.
   HBO in fact pitches the series as ``an adult anthology,'' no
doubt due to the R-rated nudity, language and violence.
   The first three half-hour stories in the series, premiering as a
trilogy on Saturday, June 10, and running as separate films at
various times in June and July, are stylishly directed by top
filmmakers Robert Zemeckis (``Back to the Future,'' ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit''), Walter Hill (``48 Hours'') and Richard Donner
(``Superman,'' ``Lethal Weapon'').
   The first in the trilogy, ``The Man Who Was Death,'' was
directed by Hill and stars Bill Sadler as a state executioner who
decides to go free ance when the death penalty is outlawed by the
Supreme Court.
   Zemeckis directed ``And All Through the House ..' a tasteless
Christmas Eve horror story. Larry Drake, who plays the gentle,
retarded office assistant from ``L.A. Law,'' is cast here as a
homicidal escapee from an insane asylum, roaming a suburban
neighborhood dressed as Santa Claus and hatcheting residents.
   Donner's offering is ``Dig That Cat ... He's Real Gone,'' an
amusingly nasty comedy about a bum (Joe Pantoliano) who is given
the nine lives of a cat in a scientist's experiment. The bum,
Ulric, turns the gift into a lucrative circus act, but _ and you
can see this one coming a mile away _ he has a slight problem
keeping track of how many lives he's used up.
   In between the stories, viewers are entertained by an unpleasant
creature-host, the Crypt-Keeper, a special-effects creation of
Kevin Yagher, who created the Freddy Krueger makeup and effects for
the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies.
   The three stories were originally published by William M. Gaines
in the comics Haunt of Fear, Tales from the Crypt and Vault of
Horror. Gaines is better known nowadays as the publisher of Mad
magazine.
   Of the three, the most engaging is ``The Man Who Was Death,''
probably because its death-penalty motif is the most relevant on
some other plane than sheer gory entertainment. There's even room
from some analysis of the story's symbolism, to-wit: the hypocrisy
illustrated by the state's use of the executioner, who finds
himself faced with the punishment he had onced meted out on behalf
of the state just because he did what the state once paid him to
do. ... Nah.
   The script, by Robert Reneau (``Action Jackson'') and Hill has
some clever if mostly vulgar dialogue. When Niles is canned by the
prison system, he talks to his bartender about the efficacy of
televising executions. ``If they put executions on TV, it'd be the
highest-rated show ever. Be Nielsens through the roof. Other
networks would start killin' people just to compete. Pretty soon
Geraldo Rivera be pullin' that switch.''
   The piece has a film-noir look and an appropriately haunting
score by Ry Cooder.
   ``Dig That Cat ... He's Real Gone'' also makes light of death,
in this case what happens to a man who is not affected by it. He
becomes careless.
   The film has the slick look of Donner's hand, and Pantoliano
(``Empire of the Sun'') shows a comic flar as the enterprising star
of the circus attraction ``See Ulric Die!'' Kathleen York is nicely
ditzy as his opportunistic girlfriend. Utlimately, though, seeing
Ulric die over and over for 30 minutes gets tedious, and the
predictable ending is no payoff.
   Zemeckis drew ``And All Through the House ...,'' the silliest of
the three and the one with the least story, being more in the style
of the scary tale told 'round the campfire. Mary Ellen Trainor,
playing a vengeful housewife who becomes Santa's prey, is a great
screamer, and the squeaky doors, howling winds and invitingly open
windows will cause the most jaded viewer to squirm a little.
   And, hey, it's summer. With network television droning on in
reruns, being scared witless by ``Tales from the Crypt'' might be a
suitable alternative to being bored silly.

   Fans longing for a Husker Du reunion beware: Bob
Mould has never been happier.
   ``It just comes to where you accept things the way they are,''
explained the 28-year-old guitarist, who has released his first
album, ``Workbook,'' since the punk trio broke up in 1987.
   ``When you're young, you fight and rebel. I just don't think I
will be doing that in 20 years because I don't think I will be
physically capable.''
   He would have a hard time maintaining the pace of his days in
Husker Du. The band emerged from St. Paul, Minn., in the early
1980s and captured a devoted audience with a string of powerful
albums that displayed a manic, desperate energy comparable to the
early Who.
   Mould, who sings ``New Day Rising'' and ``I'll Never Forget
You'' like a drowning man going under for the last time, is more
reflective on ``Workbook.'' The songs range from the upbeat single,
``See a Little Light,'' to the angry ``Poison Years,'' to the
confessional ``Sinners and Their Repentance.'' Mould even starts
the album with a low-key instrumental, ``Sunspots.''
   ``As you get older, you get a little closer to real emotions,''
he said. ``It's wonderful to express anger and frustration, but
there are other emotions. There are a lot of different things out
there.''
   Mould was attending Macalester College in St. Paul when he met
drummer Grant Hart and bassist Greg Norton. The three were soon
jamming in Norton's basement, writing songs that Mould thought were
``real abrasive and real fast.''
   Their first album, ``Land Speed Record,'' came out in 1982 and
they maintained an exhaustive pace of recording and touring over
the next few years. The band prided itself on equality, with all
three members contributing material, and stayed true to the punk
spirit by remaining accessible to the public.
   But after releasing the double album, ``Warehouse: Songs and
Stories,'' Hukser Du bitterly parted ways with disputes over
songwriting credits and accusations of drug abuse.
   ``I think immediately upon my leaving I felt a great sense of
release,'' Mould said. ``You have to let go of things like that. It
became a situation where we could not work together again. Then you
wonder what to do.
   ``I think over the course of time you start bringing in certain
elements of the group you know the others won't like. I felt like
that was getting a little frustrating.''
   He cited the difficulty in remaining committed to the sound that
attracted listeners to Husker Du. ``It was almost becoming the
point where I had no emotions, it was just a blur of white noise.
Emotionally, I was not attached to it because I no longer felt that
way. We were doing what people expected us to do.''
   After the breakup, Mould decided to spend some time alone,
working on songs that were for himself and not for public
consumption. He listened to classical music and became interested
in incorporating the cello into his own writing.
   ``It's a very emotional instrument,'' said Mould, who recruited
cellist Jane Scarpantoni for the album. ``The instrument has a very
high frequency, a very beautiful sound. When I started looking at
the material I was writing, I saw the need for one more instrument
to bridge those melodies. The cello seemed best.''
   The cello is best heard on the haunting ballad, ``Sinners and
Their Repentance,'' which Mould described as a meditation on
feelings of guilt and responsibility.
   ``I think it's a situation where people get themselves into a
predicament and do a shameful thing and immediately go into a
repentance mode. Will it really be better? You break down and cry
and apologize profusely, but will it really be better? I think some
things leave emotional scars and they don't really heal.''
   Mould was especially pleased with ``Poison Years,'' insisting he
could never have written the song a few years ago.
   ``I didn't have it in me,'' he said. ``There's something about
the way it builds and let's go. Dynamically, I'm pretty happy with
it. There are really powerful moments.''
   Mould sees winning over Husker Du fans as his biggest problem.
He admits that audience expectations could make acceptance for his
solo album more difficult.
   ``This first record and this whole period will be a little
tough. People will see my name and trigger up the past and trigger
up the present. Hopefully, they'll give it a full listen, My name
has never been that big on a record. It's always been a group.''

<HEAD>NBC Moves Toward 52-Week `Season' with New Programs for Late Summer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff,
having long favored the notion that the networks should run
original programming year-round, is taking a small step in that
direction by putting on three new series and bringing back new
``Highway to Heaven'' episodes later this summer.
   As usual, and despite evidence that the networks are losing
viewers to cable and videocassettes, most summer TV fare will
consist of reruns.
   CBS is introducing one new comedy series, though, ``Doctor,
Doctor,'' this month. And ABC will air new episodes of
``Hooperman,'' and otherwise rearrange its schedule. In August, ABC
will premiere the new Diane Sawyer-Sam Donaldson newsmagazine,
tentatively titled ``Prime Time.'' ABC will also have prime-time
baseball on Thursdays in June and July.
   NBC, which is so successful it barely had any room for new shows
on its fall schedule, is using the pre-season to give air time to
some new products. No air dates have been set, but two of the new
shows on tap, most likely to premiere in August, are:
   _``Knight and Daye,'' starring Jack Warden (``Crazy Like a
Fox'') and Mason Adams (``Lou Grant'') as a one-time radio act
reluctantly reunited after 40 years. Hope Lange plays Adams' wife.
The series comes from Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell, who wrote
``Laverne and Shirley'' and the hit movie ``Splash.''
   _``13 East,'' set in a hospital and starring Diana Bellamy as a
supervising nurse and Ellen Regan as a trainee.
   One other half-hour comedy, yet to be picked from among shows in
development for NBC, will also make a bow this summer, while
``Highway to Heaven,'' the hour drama starring Michael Landon as an
Earth-roving angel, will return with 10 new episodes. It was absent
this past season.
   ABC is basically in the business of rearranging deck chairs this
summer, giving ``Coach'' a shot at a better time period on Tuesdays
after ``Roseanne.'' ``Hooperman'' will return June 14 in the
Wednesday time period vacated by ``Coach,'' which makes its move
June 20, bumping ``Have Faith,'' which will move to Sundays,
filling half of the hour left empty by the cancellation of
``Moonlighting.'' Phew. ``Thursday Night Baseball'' premieres June
8 and runs through July 27 in the time periods now populated by
canceled shows.
   CBS is expected to once again let viewers see the really bad
stuff that didn't even make it to air by reviving the ``CBS Summer
Playhouse,'' a weekly display of busted pilots. But the network
will add one new show, ``Doctor, Doctor,'' a comedy starring Matt
Frewer (``Max Headroom'') as an idealistic young M.D. trying to
cope with the pressures of high-tech medical care. It premieres
Monday, June 12, in the ``Kate &amp; Allie'' time period. ``Kate &amp;
Allie'' will move to 8 p.m. EDT, replacing the canceled ``Live In.''
   Over on cable, HBO is launching this month ``Tales from the
Crypt,'' an anthology horror series. On July 8, Showtime is
premiering ``The Boys,'' a series from a pilot that aired last
season. It stars Norm Crosby, Norman Fell, Jackie Gayle and Lionel
Stander as the colorful denizens of a Friars Club-type men's club
that was just jolted by the arrival of the court-ordered first
female member (Janet Carroll). Steve Levitt plays the youngest
member of the group.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE REALITY _ ``Crosstown,'' a new syndicated police show, aims
to be fiction with an edge of realism, according to the producers.
The show is scheduled to premiere in the fall. It is set in a New
York City precinct house whose cops deal with such issues as drugs,
police violence and runaway kids on the job and the officers'
personal relationships at home. The show comes from Ventura
Entertainment. Sixty-five episodes of ``Crosstown'' are in
production in California. It stars Michael Callan, Anthony Alda,
Patricia Estrin, Daniel Faraldo, Jennifer Lewis and Ralph Burneau.
...
   NOT SAVING MORNING SHOWS _ Nobody is wasting videotape saving
old ``Today,'' ``Good Morning America'' or ``CBS This Morning''
broadcasts, according to a recent Nielsen survey. Of the 2 hours
and 34 minutes the average VCR household spends taping programs,
only 2 percent is devoted to the early morning hours, 6-10 a.m. Not
surprisingly, most taping, 41 percent, occurs during prime time.
Second most-popular was daytime _ workers taping favorite soaps no
doubt _ which accounted for 27 percent.

<HEAD>Tom Foley: A Democrat Who Can Charm Even Republicans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the typically bone-dry account of Sen. Alan
Simpson, all the next speaker of the House need do is ask, and the
Republicans will leave town.
   For the charm of Thomas Stephen Foley is so pure, says Simpson,
that he can ``tell you to go to hell, and make you look forward to
the trip.''
   Simpson, the assistant Republican leader of the Senate, didn't
say whether any one had ever received such an invitation from
Foley. But no one denies that the Foley, a Washington Democrat,
knows how to move people, if ever so gently, a little at a time.
   As House majority leader, Foley won nearly universal admiration
from both sides of the aisle for his scholarly command of issues,
personal cordiality and the patience of Job.
   Now, as the likely successor to Jim Wright, who is surrendering
both his speaker's throne and his House seat in the face of a
wrenching ethics investigation, the fatherly team player from
Spokane steps today into the job called the second-most powerful in
government.
   Though both trace their roots to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,
Wright was a lone wolf, Foley a faithful companion among political
peers. The ambitious Wright climbed through the ranks; Foley was
lifted and nudged through them, partly by his colleagues, partly by
political accident.
   A tireless negotiator, Foley wields power through
consensus-building and compromise. By contrast, Wright acknowledged
in his swan song to the House that he ``perhaps'' had been ``too
partisan, too insistent, too abrasive, too determined to have my
way.''
   Foley is no knee-jerk liberal _ and wouldn't have lasted in the
House if he were. Unlike most leaders whose seats are ``safe,''
Foley is from a distinctly Republican and conservative district
that has put him through many close elections.
   Though hand-picked for the House's elite by Wright and his
predecessor, former Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, Foley never
shared their penchant for partisan chest-thumping. O'Neill admired
Foley most for qualities he admittedly didn't possess himself _
meticulous craftsmanship of legislation, thorough command of the
issues, attention to organizational detail.
   ``Tom Foley,'' O'Neill once said, in both exasperation and
respect, ``is a man who can see three sides of every issue.''
   Sometimes more. Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., tells about the time
that a colleague rushed to the House floor at the last moment and
implored Foley to tell him if there were any reasons he should vote
against the bill.
   The congenial Foley ``laid out seven significant reasons,''
Dicks recalled, and the member promptly voted ``no.'' Then, just as
the electronic tote board was switching off, the fellow noticed
Foley had voted ``yes.'' He was furious. Foley merely replied:
``You didn't ask me for all the reasons why the bill is good.''
   When Foley was first elected in 1964, younger members of
Congress were left with little to do but follow their leaders.
That's not how the House works today, and Foley is a beneficiary of
the post-Watergate revolt against the seniority system and the
diffusion of power.
   ``The reality is that in a modern, participatory Congress ...
the responsibility of leadership and the necessity of leadership is
to constantly involve members in the process of decision and
consensus,'' Foley says.
   According to Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., the troika of Wright,
Foley and soon-to-resign Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California
has worked like this: ``Jim ... the captain, Tony the oar drummer
and Tom, the navigator. Democrats in the House and most Republicans
have great respect for the navigator.''
   Foley's office furnishings reflect his leadership philosophy.
Instead of the big, imposing desk preferred by most members of
Congress, Foley has a coffee table surrounded by enough sofas and
chairs to accommodate at least 18 visitors. His Belgian shephard,
Alice, can usually be found lounging on one of the carpets of
vibrant blues and reds.
   Another part of Foley's design for success comes from a lesson
he says he learned from Saint Exupery's ``The Little Prince,'' in
which the old courtier advises his charge that the way to get power
is to order people to do precisely what they wanted to do in the
first place.
   Whatever the tricks of his trade, the results are inarguable.
Foley and his coffee table have been at the center of some of the
most important legislation, invariably compromises, to emerge from
Congress in this decade.
   Just this year, Foley was host of the extraordinary talks that
in mid-April produced a budget agreement for the next fiscal year,
and he was pivotal in the bipartisan deal with the Bush
administration over Central America policy.
   A year earlier, he chaired the economic summit sessions that
followed the October 1987 crash of the stock market. Prior to that,
he engineered the final agreements on the Gramm-Rudman budget law,
and arms control policies shared by Congress and the White House.
   ``Tom Foley is just a very able, capable individual,'' says Bob
Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader. ``He's well-liked
on our side, and he's also recognized as a very formidable
opponent, one who will state the case well, and is eminently fair.''
   ``He's a man of total integrity,'' said Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``He knows the players, knows the issues.'' And
this, from Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``I wish he were a Republican.
If he were, he could be a presidential candidate.''
   In a recent poll of senior congressional staffers, Foley was the
overwhelming choice as the most respected member of the House. And
a Republican colleague has long had a ``Foley for Speaker'' button
hidden in his desk.
   Throughout Wright's travails, Foley brushed aside such talk.
Still, he acknowledged: ``It's like asking somebody in the army
`Would you like to be general?' Sure.''
   Even that was something of a grudging confession from Foley, who
has been criticized more than once for lacking both personal and
partisan drive. He came to Washington in 1961 as an aide to Sen.
Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., and likely would have served Jackson
until the senator's death if the boss hadn't given him a swift kick
into the elective current.
   Despite being urged by other state Democrats to run for the
House in 1964, Foley had virtually decided against it when Jackson
and Joseph Drumheller, a party bankroller, blew up at him, right at
the filing deadline, for passing the opportunity. Foley filed, and,
no small thanks to Lyndon Johnson's landslide, wrested away the 5th
District seat which had been held by Republicans for 22 years.
   He's been re-elected since, surviving close tests in 1976, 1978
and 1980, in the sprawling district, known as the Inland Empire,
stretching from the pine forests near the Canadian border to the
rolling wheat fields of the Palouse, near the Oregon line. It is an
area where conservatism still runs deep, where the pickup trucks
are adorned with bumper stickers reading: ``We Don't Brake for
Liberals.''

   ``I don't have any trouble communicating with my constituency,''
says Foley. ``You seldom get elected if your constituency doesn't
like you. If you're out of touch, you will find out in the next
election.''
   His voting record is mainstream Democrat, with consistently high
marks from liberal and labor groups and low scores from the right.
But he's also earned an ``A+'' from the National Rifle Association
for his opposition to gun control legislation.
   ``I can be partisan and hold the Democratic position as well as
anyone,'' said Foley. ``My idea of partisanship is not making a
desk-pounding speech. I don't think that persuades anyone.''
   Besides, he says, ``It's hard for one party to just run over the
other. I think what's done around here that has some lasting value
usually has some element of bipartisanship about it.''
   Foley inherited his knack for getting along with Republicans
from his father, a Democrat and lawyer who managed to win election,
first as prosecutor, then as judge, in conservative Spokane. He
recalls with a grin that his GOP neighbors treated the family
``almost as practitioners of a strange religion.''
   He says his childhood was ``comfortable,'' but one in which his
father took pains to make sure young Tom understood the social
upheaval of the Great Depression by showing him the shantytowns,
the long unemployment lines and people waiting for a handout at the
back door of the hospital.
   After graduating from the University of Washington Law School in
1957, Foley seemed destined to follow in his father's footsteps. He
was a deputy city prosecutor for two years, and an assistant state
attorney general for another year. But then Jackson beckoned him to
Washington, D.C., where he became counsel for the Senate Interior
Committee.
   ``Some Democrats find him too fair,'' says Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass. ``He is a superb leader,'' but, in Frank's view, it's
probably a good thing that there aren't many others like Foley in
the leadership. ``We might cross the line that divides a political
body from a seminar,'' he said.
   Foley's wife, Heather, 48, a graduate of Georgetown University
Law Center, has managed his office without pay since 1970. They
have no children, but she rarely travels with her husband, staying
behind to tend to the administrative chores.
   Neither is big on the party circuit. Foley, 6-foot-4, exercises
alone or takes long walks with dog Alice to stay trim, sometimes
striding from his embassy row apartment to the Capitol, about 40
minutes. But, unlike most of his colleagues, he cares little about
organized sports.
   He is a fluent television performer, blessed with handsome
physical features, a near-photographic memory and a quick sense of
humor _ the only thing, unlike O'Neill or Wright, that he ever
fires from the hip. Once braced with a question about a state
prison inmate who challenged him in the Democratic primary, Foley
deadpanned that his opponent was running a ``guarded campaign.''
   His memory is a source for amazement among political circles. He
has been known to cite documents almost verbatim in legislative
meetings, and he almost never speaks from a prepared text. During a
visit to the Soviet Union, his hosts were so impressed by his
extemporized speeches that they speculated that his pocket
calculator was really a miniature TelePrompTer.
   Some believe Foley's destiny lies beyond the speaker's office. A
couple years back, former Democratic National Chairman Robert S.
Strauss declared ``There's no one in America, Republican or
Democrat, more qualified for the presidency than Tom Foley.''
   Dicks agrees, saying ``If we had a parliamentary system, Foley
would have been president a long time ago.''
   Meanwhile, many see him as just the right man to pull Congress
out of the partisan backwash from the John Tower and Jim Wright
battles. ``He's the great conciliator,'' said Dicks. ``He'll debate
people, but he doesn't leave people bloodied.''

<TEXT>
   Barry Manilow, who has had a devoted following
since he first warbled ``Mandy'' 15 years ago, has more fans than
ever today.
   And now he can also count music critics as fans, as he continues
an extensive tour that began in November 1987 and will run through
1990.
   ``This is the first tour that the reviews have been consistently
good,'' said Manilow, whose month-long engagement on Broadway at
the Gershwin Theater has been extended. ``Most of the time they've
been fair to awful. It turned around all of a sudden. But it'll
probably change back to them hating this new album. It's the kind
they have always not liked.''
   The album, ``Barry Manilow,'' returns to what he does best: big,
romantic pop ballads.
   ``I've always been a misfit musically,'' the 43-year-old
singer-songwriter said in an interview. ``I come from the kind of
music that happened before rock 'n' roll. I'm not that old, but I
was not affected by the rock 'n' roll that most people were being
affected by. I was affected by show tunes, jazz and songs written
by Harold Arlen and Irving Berlin because my parents reacted to
that.
   ``That type of person shouldn't draw big crowds and have hit
records, and I did. The critics never were happy with that.''
   Manilow doesn't like what he hears played on the radio these
days. ``The songs are about having a great party ... . I have to
believe there is more to all this work I do than just convincing
people to have a great party ... . I have to believe there are
people who want to be moved by emotions.''
   His bundle of hits includes ``I Write the Songs,'' ``Tryin' to
Get the Feeling Again,'' ``This One's for You'' and ``I Can't Smile
Without You.'' His new single is ``Keep Each Other Warm.'' What he
doesn't write for his albums, Arista Records president Clive Davis
selects for him. He left Arista in 1985-86 for RCA and has since
returned.
   ``When I was away from Arista, Clive continued to put songs away
for me. He knew we'd get together again after I was sowing my wild
notes,'' Manilow said.
   When he returned to Arista, he and Davis agreed he'd do a swing
album first, then the current pop one.
   ``I wasn't in favor of making a pop album,'' he said. ``I
couldn't hear a space for my kind of pop music on the radio. Clive
says there's a lack of this kind of music on the radio and it has
to come back.
   ``If this pop record takes off, I'd be foolish not to follow
that for awhile. I can't predict the future but maybe I'll do a pop
album with a couple of jazz songs on it.''
   In 1984, Manilow cut ``2:00 A.M. _ Paradise Cafe'' with some
noted jazz musicians. He calls it the highlight of his career.
   ``I'm learning not to be attached to the results. The reason we
do things is to create something beautiful that you're proud of.
You hope people like it. Eight years ago, I would live for
Wednesdays, when chart information comes out. Now, unless they call
with the numbers, I forget about them.''
   Manilow's autobiography, ``Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to
Paradise,'' was published in 1987. Other writers praised its style
and tone, and Manilow says proudly that it wasn't ghost written.
   In the book, he attacks nobody, is frank about personality
failings, talks about being Bette Midler's musical director and
about Linda Allen, the movie set decorator with whom he lives, and
recounts finding out in 1981 that he only had $11,000 in the bank.
Investment advisers had lost the money Manilow made in six years of
superstardom. He didn't lose the homes he owned in Bel Air and Palm
Springs, Calif.
   ``When I was told I didn't have any bread, I went to work and
worked harder than I ever worked before,'' the singer said.
``Luckily, I was able to pull it back together. I'm still working
at it. You don't need to feel sorry for me but I'm not anywhere
near where I should have been about 10 years ago.
   ``After having that kind of good fortune, to not have anything
to show for it was a disgusting story. There weren't any criminals.
It was bad management and bad advice. It'll never happen again.
It's a good lesson for all of us: Take responsibility for your
life.''
   His relations with Midler were never strained. ``I wrote a song
for her, `Perfect Isn't Easy But It's Me,' which she sang as a
pampered French poodle in `Oliver and Company.' We were in the
studio a couple of days together and had a good time.''
   The show he's doing on Broadway also is organized as
autobiography. ``We wanted to make it a theatrical production as
opposed to a pop concert. Fictitious story lines all felt
contrived; the only thing that felt honest was pulling pieces of my
life out.''
   He hopes to write a Broadway musical and star in it, possibly
about the life of Danny Kaye.
   After he closes on Broadway and before the tour resumes in the
fall, he plans to do nothing. ``I don't know whether I'll be able
to do that. I'm one of those over-achieving Jewish Brooklyn guys
who can't rest until there's 15 projects going at once.
   ``I'm storing up on books,'' he said. ``I can chain myself to a
chaise lounge and read. ... I've got books on how to become a
better person. I want to read the works of Jung. I want to learn.
   ``About a year ago, I enrolled in a short-story-writing course,
under an assumed name, at the University of California at Berkeley.
... One of my fantasies is going to college. I would be a great
student. I would be raising my hand every five minutes, putting my
two cents in.''

<TEXT>
   On a small patch of fertile ground in
southern Idaho, the Ihler family is quietly doing its part to
change the way America farms.
   When a growth-regulating chemical called Alar made headlines
this year as a potential health hazard and grocers yanked apples
from their counters, the Ihlers shook their heads with an
I-told-you-so smile.
   When their potato-farming neighbors panicked at a recent
government report questioning the safety of aldicarb, a widely used
insecticide, the Ihlers weren't surprised.
   ``Agriculture is in the dark ages,'' said Rick Ihler.
   The Ihlers _ brothers Rick and Terry and their father, Dick _
have preached for years that the path to agricultural enlightenment
lies in organic farming. Suddenly people seem to be listening _
even in conservative regions like these irrigated drylands, where
new farming ideas run up against deep-rooted traditions.
   Pesticides and chemical fertilizers, which brought farmers here
and across the country into the green revolution, now are getting
bad press.
   Consumers are clamoring for organic fruits and vegetbles. A
Louis Harris poll conducted in November for Organic Gardening
magazine said 84 percent of Americans said they would buy
organically grown food if it was available, and 49 percent would
pay more for it.
   More mainstream farmers _ jolted by consumers' concerns, rising
chemical costs and depleted soils _ are taking a second look at a
farming approach they once dismissed as a fad practiced by
sandal-wearing hippies.
   The lesson from the Ihlers' Holly Farms is that organic farming
can work, but it doesn't come easy.
   They've had to fight not only insects, weather and weeds, but a
firmly entrenched agribusiness establishment geared toward chemical
dependence.
   ``To farm organically is to buck the system,'' Rick Ihler said
recently, taking a break from planting carrots on a windy day.
``Organic farming is still considered off-the-wall in Idaho.''
   The Ihlers made the switch to organic farming in 1981. They had
been farming more than 4,000 acres, most of it on rented land. Like
many farmers, they depended on bank loans to make it from one
harvest to the next.
   ``We got fed up with it. All we were doing was financing the
banker's pocketbook,'' Rick said.
   They shrank their operation back to the 103-acre family farm and
set about finding natural substitutes for the manmade chemicals
they had been using.
   ``We learned from trial and error,'' Rick said. Today, they grow
carrots, peas, onions, barley, hay, potatoes, radishes and beans on
their irrigated acreage.
   Their methods range from low-tech to high; from spreading
composted sheep dung to dragging a high-voltage weed zapper behind
a tractor. They rotate crops, sow nitrogen-fixing plants such as
peas and clover, and use natural products such as kelp extracts and
micro-fungi.
   Dick Ihler, 56, a tattooed Korean War veteran who is clearly not
part of the sandal-wearing crowd, nevertheless acknowledges talking
to carrots and experimenting with pyramids and crystals as energy
sources for the crops.
   ``There are a lot of things you can't tell people, because they
won't believe you,'' said Rick.
   Not that they aren't asking. The Ihlers have received calls from
dozens of farmers wanting to know how to go organic. Organic
farming trade groups around the country are being swamped with
requests for information.
   Spurred by the recent pesticide scares, mainstream trade groups
and researchers also are pursuing ways to reduce farmers'
dependence on manmade pesticides and fertilizers.
   Yet organic farmers still are a tiny minority. Even in
California, where most of the country's organic produce is grown,
organic farms make up less than 1 percent of the total.
   In Idaho the numbers are even smaller.
   Dick Ihler grew up here, but he's still trying to convince some
neighbors he wasn't corrupted by the 16 years he spent in
California before moving back to the fammily farm in 1972.
   Holly Farms operates outside the traditional marketing and
distribution system. A typical Idaho potato farmer, for example,
must sell his spuds to one of a few big corporate processors. The
Ihlers have had to cultivate their customers as carefully as their
fields.
   ``We tried to sell our carrots to a local hospital. They
couldn't buy them, because of contracts with the big distributors.
The school system was the same,'' Dick Ihler said.
   Holly Farms now ships produce to 37 states. Customers include
food cooperatives, natural food stores, and an organic baby-food
maker in Vermont.
   ``We researched markets for five years before we ever planted a
crop,'' Rick said.
   Holly Farms uses a private certification program to back up the
farm's ``organically grown'' labels. They keep daily logs of what
is put on or in the ground. ``If you spit on the ground, you better
write it down,'' Dick said.
   They guard their property against errant chemicals used by
neighbors. When farmers upstream used fungicides on their fields,
the Ihlers treated their irrigation water to remove the chemicals.
They complained long and loud enough to local crop dusters that the
airplanes now make wide detours around their farm.
   The work has paid off. Holly Farms still operates under a
bankruptcy order protecting it from a bank that tried to call its
loans due, so the Ihlers are shy about giving figures on income.
But Rick said their carrot crop alone, which is about 60 percent of
their business, grossed $100,000 last year.
   The farm supports 14 people in three families. It also employs
18 seasonal workers and at least 50 at harvest time.
   The farm's reputation is growing, with a 1,200 percent increase
in sales during the past five years, Rick said. About 100 people
visit the farm each year, some of them pilgrims who camp out by the
stream to soak up the farm's ``energy high'' and drink carrot juice.
   The Ihlers praise organic farming, yet warn it won't work for
everybody.
   Even before the term organic was popular, their family farm was
relatively chemical-free, in contrast to much farm land, which Rick
said has been propped up with chemicals for so long it has lost its
natural resistance to pests.
   ``What does a drug addict do when you cut him off from his
heroin or cocaine? He goes through withdrawal symptoms,'' Rick
said. ``The land is like a living being. It goes through
withdrawal, too.''
   That and a lack of experience with organic methods have doomed
more than one would-be organic farmer, Rick said. ``So many farmers
don't want to do any homework,'' he said.
   One secret of organic farming is caring as much about the food's
quality as the consumer does, Rick said.
   When they discovered that their carrot bags were labeled with an
ink containing a potentially toxic chemical, the Ihlers recalled
all their carrots.
   ``Our sales jumped 300 percent after that,'' Rick said. ``People
saw our concern about quality.''

   It's something of a cross between ``Ripley's
Believe It or Not'' and ``60 Minutes,'' which may have inspired its
name. Soviet television's rapid-fire news show ``600 Seconds,''
which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the
establishment, has become immensely popular since it went on the
air. Before Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, such a program would
have been unthinkable in the Soviet Union.

   A lost bull roams a busy city street.
Prostitutes woo foreign customers. A holiday bombing rips off a
man's legs.
   These and other eye-opening images are flashing across Soviet
television screens as glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
drive for openness, goes video.
   Traditionally, the Kremlin has used state-run television as it
did other media _ to reach the masses with propaganda, rather than
programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just
plain fun. The airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on
subjects such as the grain harvest. The leadership still commands
unlimited time, and news shows spend a lot of time reporting lists
of government leaders seeing each other off on trips.
   But Gorbachev is a more lively TV personality than his
predecessors, and frequently turns to television to make speeches
and broadcast his street-side talks with people. For the first time
this winter, parliamentary candidates debated each other on
television.
   Western music videos are shown routinely, ``space bridges''
bring the uncensored views of Western studio audiences into Soviet
living rooms, and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives
Soviets a glimpse of Western lifestyles.
   One trailblazing program, which featured the offbeat stories
about the bull, the prostitutes and the bombing, is ``600
Seconds,'' a fast-paced live show on Leningrad television that has
become a smash hit since its premiere in December 1987.
   One avid fan of 30-year-old anchorman Alexander Nevzorov said
the program ``shows the Soviet people what they were torn away from
all their lives, things that we learned to close our eyes to.''
   Six days a week, 15 million people in Leningrad, Moscow and
other regions can switch on their TV sets to catch up on the latest
sensations from the Soviet Union's second-largest city.
   ``600 Seconds,'' the news magazine show ``Fifth Wheel,'' the
debate program ``Public Opinion'' and the music discussion program
``Musical Boxing Ring'' make Leningrad television among the most
progressive in the Soviet Union, reinforcing the reputation of the
city built by Peter the Great as a window on the West.
   ``600 Seconds'' is like a cross between ``Ripley's Believe It or
Not'' and ``60 Minutes.'' Leningraders have nicknamed the show,
``Our City Scandal-Monger.''
   At 10 p.m., a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes
of news reports read live by a studio announcer, and videotaped
reports presented rapid-fire in a down-to-earth style. A digital
clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the
remaining seconds.
   Everything about the show sets it apart from ordinary
broadcasts, which are presented in formal language in detail, and
are visually dull.
   The show's popularity is evident to the staff. About 200 calls
and dozens of letters a day pour into the tiny, dingy room in
Leningrad's TV center where two harried producers and Nevzorov work
under a crumbling portrait of Lenin. Ironically, no portrait of
Gorbachev, whose glasnost policy made the program possible, hangs
on the wall.
   Nevzorov's irreverence surfaces in every broadcast. He relishes
stirring up the town with what he calls ``sensations.'' The program
consists largely of crime reports, but also has a heavy dose of the
bizarre, such as a story about the city's dirtiest toilet.
   In a recent broadcast, ``600 Seconds'' took on one of the city's
biggest department stores, accusing its employees of selling highly
sought Finnish clothing under the table. The store demanded a
retraction, but Nevzorov told viewers later that police had
investigated and that ``no excuses can be made.''
   The program has stopped reporting about dogs, says producer
Kirill M. Shishkin, because the staff was swamped with calls for
days by people offering to adopt a canine after one broadcast
reported the dog's owner had been killed in a car accident.
   Nevzorov, the show's co-creator and main anchor, races around
this city of 4.9 million people all day to gather material for his
Monday-through-Saturday broadcast, relying heavily on tips from the
public and police.
   He has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go
along with such status in the West _ no secretary, no private
office, no chauffeur-driven limousine and a salary of only $475 a
month.
   Adoring fans place flowers on his car and beg for autographs.
The Soviet press has praised his pioneering style, and colleagues
say he has an uncanny sense of what will excite the public.
Journalism students at Moscow State University are studying his
program as a model of how news should be reported on television.
   But Nevzorov rejects the label journalist. He is a former horse
trainer and TV scriptwriter, and bristles when the word journalist
is mentioned. Most Soviet journalists, he said, could not come up
with the stories he does, and he doesn't agree with the Western
notion that journalists should be objective and not sensationalize
the news.
   He openly acknowledges that cooperatives, the fledgling private
businesses spawned by Gorbachev's reforms, are a target. ``Whenever
we have the opportunity to nail them, we do,'' he says.
   The public turns to ``600 Seconds'' to fight the Soviet
bureaucracy. On one recent afternoon, a caller asked the program to
prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his
apartment window.
   ``600 Seconds'' and other Leningrad TV programs have helped lift
the veil from subjects such as homelessness, rape, prostitution,
murder and robbery, and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject,
privileges of the Soviet elite. One episode of ``Fifth Wheel,'' for
instance, complained that elaborate government homes were being
well maintained next to a childrens hospital that was a shambles.
   But there are still forbidden themes. Nevzorov's boss, Alexander
A. Yurkov, said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are
barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary.
   Edward A. Sagalayev, head of Soviet TV's Information Department,
who is fighting to reform Soviet TV, said reforms can be difficult.
``I also have my bosses. We have our minister. He has his deputies
... And it is not always possible to overcome psychologically these
traditions.''

<HEAD>Congress Examining the Exodus From Farm to City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exodus from farm to city is ``good for no
one,'' says a congressman who is holding hearings this week on what
Congress can do to make rural communities more appealing.
   ``In 1986 and 1987, more than 1 million people left rural
America,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla.
   English has asked more than 40 organizations and individuals to
testify before his House Agriculture subcommittee on conservation,
credit and rural development.
   The hearings, beginning Tuesday, will continue through June.
Later in the summer, the committee will go on the road to hear from
residents of rural areas.
   ``Unless action is taken, virtually every citizen of the country
will be forced to live in a metropolitan area,'' English said.
``That scenario is good for no one. It would overburden our cities
and suburbs as much as it would devastate our rural communities.''
   English said he wants the rural development legislation that
emerges from the hearings to be part of the 1990 farm bill, the
measure that will determine the government' farm policy for several
years.
   ``The difficulties plaguing rural America do not have a single
focus,'' he said. ``Our efforts are incomplete for example, if we
address capital investment issues, but ignore those of education or
rural health care.''
   The problem the government faces is money.
   ``Any new initiative on which we embark will have to bear those
financing restrictions in mind,'' said English.
   He said the subcommittee will be looking at ways to use existing
funds and resources better and find outside financing.
   The Bush administration wants to cut the agriculture budget by
$1.1 billion in the new fiscal year and has suggested that some of
those cuts come in rural development programs like water and sewer
grants, business and industrial loans and community facility loans.
   The issue of rural development is not new, said Bob Bergland,
who was agriculture secretary under President Carter and now heads
the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
   ``The out migration from rural areas ebb and flow. That of the
last two or three years is as bad as it was in the 40s and 50s,''
Bergland said Friday.
   Bergland, scheduled to testify before the committee Thursday,
said that in the 1960s people were moving back to the farm in large
numbers.
   ``There was the flower children syndrome,'' he said in reference
to the era in which young people were rejecting the rat race of the
business world in an effort to find a more peaceful life in nature.
   At that time, many people set up small farms, Bergland said.
   He said the government's biggest role is in improving education
and infrastructure (road, sewers, water, telephones, electrical
service) in farm communities.
   ``The high school drop out rate is as bad as urban ghettos,''
Bergland said. And, so is poverty, he said.
   ``The difference is, you can see poverty in the cities. But in
the country it's hidden over the next hill.''
   He said students who go to college don't come back to the small
towns because they can make more money elsewhere.
   ``We have an enormous brain drain,'' he said. ``When we start
working on industry that has a limited work force, it's a problem.''
   He said the changing face of American agriculture has
contributed to the problem.
   ``We have 2.2 million farms and 15 percent of them produce 90
percent of what is sold,'' he said. ``Attrition is taking its toll.
There aren't so many people going broke, but there aren't any new
starts.''
   He called on the government to ``break this cycle'' of young
people leaving rural areas.
   He said the movement should start locally with help from state
universities and coordination by the federal government.

   High interest rates depressed the rate of
private construction in April, but the government said that total
construction spending rose a weak 0.1 percent due to an upturn in
work on public projects.
   The Commerce Department on Thursday reported a total increase in
new spending to $414.9 billion on a seasonally adjusted annual rate
after declines of three consecutive months. That was 4.7 percent
above a year earlier.
   The last time construction spending fell for three straight

<HEAD>Chain Store Sales Growth Meager in May</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Weak sales at many of the country's biggest store chains in May
suggests consumers have adopted a cautious attitude about spending.
   A rise in interest rates over the winter led to increases in
many adjustable rate mortgages, which may be discouraging consumers
from indulging in expensive goods that typically are bought on
credit.
   Higher prices for gasoline may have crimped purchasing power a
bit in May while some consumers may have decided to postpone
shopping trips so they could replenish savings depleted when they
paid tax bills in April.
   Sales tallies reported Thursday varied, depending on the type of
retailer, but industry-wide results looked sluggish, according to
analysts.
   ``I think they show the consumer is very cautious,'' said Carl
Palash, senior economist at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc.
``People are probably looking at their mortgage rates going up _
those who have adjustable rate mortgages _ and holding back on
spending.''
   Chains with a heavy emphasis on women's wear did better than
general merchandisers. Sales at some general-merchandise stores may
have been hurt by abundant rainfall in the Northeast during May.
   Women's apparel merchants have been reporting improving sales
all year as fashions get a better reception than those of the past
two years.
   Gains reported by several clothing retailers appeared better
than they really were because May's sales were compared with last
year's relatively low volumes.
   An analysis by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. indicated most
sectors of the retailing business took in less in May than in April.
   The brokerage said its weighted average of 37 merchants' sales
at stores open at least a year rose 4.2 percent in May after
April's 7 percent gain.
   Drexel's index of sales at 14 department stores and discounters
rose 3.8 percent last month following a 6.9 percent April increase
and its index of 12 specialty apparel and shoe retailers went up
7.6 percent compared with 11.2 percent in April. The specialty hard
goods index, which includes sales of electronics, toys and
furniture, rose 3.4 percent vs. April's 3 percent rise.
   The results Thursday were from some of the biggest general
merchandise chains in the United States, plus apparel retailers.
Monthly retail sales from the government are more comprehensive and
include the take at other types of establishments such as auto
dealers, supermarkets and restaurants.
   Among those reporting were Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's
biggest merchant, which said sales in the four weeks ended May 27
rose 5.3 percent to $2.5 billion from $2.38 billion in May 1988.
Sales at stores open at least a year, called same or comparable
sales, rose 3.1 percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts consider same-store sales a more
accurate indication of a company's performance than totals that
include sales at new stores. Not every retailer discloses results
on this basis.
   Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, an
industry newsletter, said Sears' results suggest customers are
losing enthusiasm about the nationwide chain's new low-pricing
policy.
   ``That does not augur very well for the success of their
so-called everyday low pricing strategy,'' said Barnard, estimating
that the retail giant must maintain 5 percent same-store sales
growth to keep its profits ahead of inflation.
   Sears introduced the strategy earlier this year in a bid to
compete with fast-growing chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
which regularly reports double-digit sales growth.
   Wal-Mart, currently ranked No. 3, said May sales rose 25 percent
to $2.03 billion from 1988's $1.63 billion. On a comparable-store
basis, sales increased 11 percent.
   Second-ranked K mart Corp. reported a sales increase of 2.5
percent for the four weeks ended May 24 to $2.19 billion from the
previous year's $2.14 billion. On a comparable-store basis, sales
were off 0.6 percent.
   K mart earlier had predicted its take would be disappointing and
Thursday attributed the weakness to sluggish demand for clothes,
especially ladies' wear.
   At J.C.Penney Co., pre-Mother's Day sales of women's dresses and
fine jewelry were strong but men's sportswear sagged. Total store
and catalog sales edged up 1.7 percent to $1.02 billion in May from
$1.01 billion a year earlier. Same-store sales slipped 0.9 percent.
Penney's sales growth was better after subtracting from last year's
totals sales of now-discontinued items.
   Specialty apparel seller Limited Inc. said sales rose 9 percent
in May to $310.7 million from $285.4 million the year before.
   The Limited results excluded the revenue taken in at Lerner
Woman, which Limited has announced it is selling. Including Lerner
Woman, Limited's sales went up 18 percent in the month. On a
comparable-store basis, sales rose 11 percent in May.

   Maytag Corp. says it will sell its furniture
business to Ladd Furniture Corp. in a $213 million transaction.
   Maytag had been trying to find a buyer for the six furniture
companies since it acquired those businesses with the Hoover Co. in
its January takeover of their parent, the Chicago Pacific Corp.
   Maytag has said it wants to concentrate on its core businesses
of home appliances and vending equipment.
   Under the agreement announced Thursday, Ladd, of High Point,
N.C., will pay Maytag $202.5 million in cash and will assume
approximately $10.5 million in debt on the books of the furniture
companies in California, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
   The deal is subject to regulatory review and completion of
financing of the transaction by Ladd, which said it already has a
commitment from Chase Manhattan Bank. The transaction is scheduled
to close in approximately 30 days, Maytag said.
   The companies being sold are Brown Jordan, located at El Monte,
Calif.; Gunlocke, Wayland, N.Y.; Kittinger, Buffalo, N.Y.; McGuire,
San Francisco; Pennsylvania House, Lewisburg, Pa.; and Charter
Group, Martinsville, Va.
   Maytag is made up of 13 companies with manufacturing facilities
in eight countries and approximately 28,000 employees. Its
appliance brands are Admiral, Jenn-Air, Hardwick, Hoover, Magic
Chef, Maytag and Norge.

<HEAD>Speculation About USX Future After Icahn Sells Texaco Stake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Icahn's sale of a record 42.32
million-share block of Texaco Inc. stock has fueled Wall Street
speculation about the takeover strategist's plans and whether they
involve an old target: USX Corp.
   Trading in USX stock was halted near the close of the New York
Stock Exchange session Thursday due to too many buy orders and not
enough sell orders after Icahn sold his Texaco stock. USX finished
the day up $2.62{ at $37.50 a share in NYSE composite trading.
   Icahn ended his long and often bitter involvement with Texaco by
selling his 17.3 percent stake _ which made him the company's
biggest shareholder _ for $49 a share or a total of $2.07 billion.
The block trade was the most expensive ever on the NYSE, according
to Catherine Maroney, a Big Board spokeswoman.
   Texaco closed down $2.12{ at $49 a share.
   ``We think the company has improved a great deal in a year and a
half and we like to think we played a small part in helping them to
do that, but we felt it was time to move on and we wish the company
and management well,'' Icahn said in a telephone interview.
   Icahn declined to comment further and it was not immediately
known how he planned to use proceeds of the stock sale and from a
special $8-a-share dividend Texaco paid all shareholders earlier
this year under a wide-ranging restructuring.
   Outsiders have estimated Icahn paid an average of $36.60 a share
for his stake, giving him a potential gain of $12.40 a share on the
stock sale alone. The stock sale plus the dividend puts Icahn's
profit at more than $$800 million, calculating from an average
share purchase price of $36.60.
   But there has been widespread speculation that Icahn, who
already has a major stake in USX, might make a play for the oil and
steel giant. He already has made one bid for USX _ a $7.2 billion
offer that he abandoned in early 1987 after the USX board rejected
it.
   Possibly heightening the speculation was the retirement
Wednesday of USX Chairman David M. Roderick, who led the company in
its battle against Icahn.
   The company underwent a major restructuring under Roderick,
including the writedown of $3 billion in mostly steel assets and
the $10 billion acquisitions of Marathon Oil Co. and Texas Oil &amp;
Gas Corp. The $9.9 billion in revenue from those companies last
year accounted for nearly two-thirds of USX total revenue of $16.9
billion and compared with $5.8 billion in steel revenue.
   There was no answer at USX offices in Pittsburgh when a reporter
called for comment late Thursday.
   Texaco spokeswoman Anita Larsen said Icahn's shares were bought
by the investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Salomon
Brothers Inc. and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   Ms. Larsen said the shares remained under restrictions set by a
January agreement between Icahn and Texaco, which was aimed at
ensuring the stock would not end up in the hands of a potentially
hostile suitor.
   Ms. Larsen said Texaco had no further comment on the sale.
   Icahn, who is chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., acquired
about 24 million Texaco shares from Australian investor Robert
Holmes a Court after the 1987 stock market crash. TWA already owned
5.9 million Texaco shares and Icahn further increased its stake
following the purchases from Holmes a Court.
   Icahn complained that Texaco management was not doing enough to
raise the company's stock price and indicated he might mount a
takeover of the company. His threats complicated Texaco's attempt
to extricate itself from bankruptcy proceedings and a $10.35
billion damage judgment it was ordered to pay Pennzoil Co.
   Texaco's board rejected Icahn's later proposal for a $14.5
billion buyout and he failed to unseat the board in a proxy fight
at Texaco's annual meeting a year ago.
   He also fought with Texaco over the terms of its bankruptcy
reorganization plan. The company sought protection from creditors
to avoid posting a multibillion-dollar bond while it appealed the
1985 Pennzoil verdict, which resulted from Texaco's acquisition of
Getty Oil Co.
   After Texaco emerged from bankruptcy protection, Icahn bickered
with management over its plan to sell billions of dollars of assets
and pay stockholders the special $8 share dividend, or a total of
about $1.9 billion.
   These issues were resolved in the January standstill agreement,
which altered Texaco's ``poison pill'' takeover defense but also
limited how Icahn could sell his stock and barred him from making a
takeover attempt against Texaco for seven years.
   Thursday's Texaco block trade was the second-largest in terms of
shares, after the 1986 sale of 48.79 million-share block of
Navistar International Corp. That block sold for $10 a share, or
$487.9 million, and previously had been the most expensive single
block trade.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Call For Tighter State Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tighter state controls on the insurance
industry, including full monitoring and comparative disclosure of
prices for auto policies, were proposed by an independent agents
association and consumers groups.
   In unveiling a ``national model'' Thursday for state insurance
departments, the organizations called also for stricter ethics
standards for regulators, specified periods for the settlement of
claims, and the establishment of a nationwide computer network to
share consumer complaint data.
   The model, forwarded to the governors of all the states, was a
joint project of the Consumer Insurance Interest Group, an
independent advocacy federation headed by Esther Peterson, former
consumer adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, and
the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, also
known as PIA National.
   The plan also was backed by the Consumer Federation of America,
the National Insurance Consumer Organization, and Public Citizen.
   Mrs. Peterson called it ``a yardstick that regulators and
legislators can use to enhance the effectiveness of insurance
regulation in their states.''
   PIA National President David L. Ream said ``both consumers and
insurance agents will benefit if minimum standards are implemented
in all the states. As a result, consumers would be able to receive
price comparison information more readily, and agents would have
greater assurance that the companies they place their customers'
business with are financially sound.''
   Highlights of the proposal:
   _Strengthen the size and quality of state regulatory agencies by
allocating to their budgets at least 10 percent of the premium
taxes insurers pay annually to the states. Most agencies now
operate with much smaller budgets, equivalent, on average, to 6
percent of the premium taxes collected.
   _Bar regulatory officials from entering the employment of
insurance companies for one year after leaving their official
positions.
   _Draw up specified time periods in which claims should be paid,
and maintain and disclose complaint information by company and line
of insurance.
   _Conduct routine financial examinations of companies to make
sure funds are available to pay claims.
   _Maintain ``readily accessible'' price information on personal
auto insurance, so conumers can make one-stop comparisons.
   _Appoint independent consumer advocates or councils for advice
on regulatory policies.

<HEAD>New York Stock Exchange Approves $5 Million Trading Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange has approved for
trading a ``basket'' of 500 stocks and billed as the first of its
kind in that it provides ownership of each of the actual component
stocks.
   Units of the portfolio _ valued now at about $5 million apiece _
will include 126,000 shares of stock reflecting those in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index.
   Existing stock ``basket'' investments traded on the American and
Philadelphia stock exchanges represent the S&amp;P index itself, rather
than the actual shares that make up the index.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that
regulates the nation's securities markets, must approve the new
instrument. NYSE officials said Thursday they hoped it would begin
trading in September.
   NYSE officials said their new stock basket, to be called the
Exchange Stock Portfolio, was designed for trading by large
institutional investors and not individuals.
   The number of shares of each company in the unit is weighted to
reflect the index. For example each unit would have holdings
ranging in size from 3,100 shares of Exxon Corp. to nine of Monarch
Machine Tool Co.
   ``You are a shareholder of a stock,'' Donald Solodar, NYSE
senior vice president of capital markets, told a news conference.
``You are not somebody trading in an index participation index. You
will have all the shares in your account.''
   The basket will include 462 NYSE-listed stocks and 38 traded on
the American Stock Exchange or the nation's over-the-counter
markets. NYSE officials said they would ask the other exchanges for
permission to trade their stocks in its portfolio.
   The value of the stocks currently in the index would be about $5
million, officials said. That compares with about $3,100 per unit
for stock baskets now traded on the Philadelphia and American stock
exchanges.
   Solodar said the new portfolio could help ease market volatility
that may be heightened by waves of computerized program trades, as
occurred during the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Program trading is a strategy by which speculators attempt to
profit from disparities between the prices of stock index futures
and options and the prices of stocks represented by the indexes.
   Because the strategy generally involves large numbers of shares
traded by Wall Street firms or institutional investors, it has been
blamed for causing or worsening big market price swings.
   The new product could add capital that market players could use
to try to balance a one-sided market, Solodar said. Trading will be
governed by a ``call market'' in which officials will be able to
point out signs of trading imbalances every 15 minutes.
   In a statement, NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said studies
following the market crash recommended developing such an equities
portfolio that would include ownership of the stocks.
   ``The exchange stock portfolio approved today by the NYSE board
of directors incorporates those recommendations, and should meet
the needs of our customers,'' he said.
   The SEC in March approved the sale of stock baskets on the
Philadelphia and American exchanges. Those are priced according to
S&amp;P 500, which essentially allows investors to bet on the overall
direction of the stock market as a whole.
   Those products are based on the current value of indexes of
stocks and do not provide ownership of their shares. Investors
receive quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of
any regular cash dividend declared on the component stocks of the
basket.
   The nation's two futures markets have challenged those baskets,
saying they are thinly disguised stock index futures and therefore
should be limited to futures exchanges.

<HEAD>Researcher Finds Strong Consumer Distaste for Objectionable TV Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey says most Americans would support
advertisers that withdraw commercials from TV programs that some
viewers find objectionable and would back a boycott of companies
that sponsor such shows.
   One in four people surveyed said the government should make it
illegal to show objectionable material on television, according to
the survey released Thursday by the consumer research firm
Oxtoby-Smith Inc.
   Respondents were asked to describe what they regarded as
objectionable and 74 percent cited excessive violence, 67 percent
sex, 60 percent profanity, 58 percent cited ``subjects that should
be private'' and 41 percent ethnic stereotypes.
   The survey comes as a number of individuals and groups upset
with what they say is excessive sex, violence, profanity or
stereotyping in TV programs have captured attention with calls for
advertisers to withdraw ads from those shows.
   Joseph Smith, president of Oxtoby-Smith, said those calls appear
to have ``touched a sensitive, pervasive and perhaps festering
public concern.''
   ``The naive supposition that the recent flurry of protest
against `objectionable' programming reflects the opinions of a
small but vocal minority on society's fringe simply isn't supported
by what we've learned,'' he said.
   But several advertising and television executives questioned the
significance of the poll's findings, noting that how a question is
phrased may have a lot to do with how it is answered.
   They said, for instance, that people who say they support
withdrawing ads from an ``objectionable'' show may disagree on what
is objectionable.
   ``It's a socially acceptable response. There are not many people
who would give a negative response to something like this,'' said
Paul Sonkin, vice president of network audience research at ABC.
   Thomas Winner, media director at the ad agency
Campbell-Mithun-Esty, said he didn't think there was much
significance in the poll results.
   ``If someone called, what would you say? And would you really
care about this if someone didn't call?'' he said.
   But David Smith, a marketing executive at his father's firm,
said the poll questions were designed to be ``as dispassionate as
possible.''
   The survey relied on telephone interviews conducted May 4-10
with a randomly-selected sample of 500 adults across the country.
The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.
   Oxtoby-Smith, which has been in business since 1956 and has
counted Block Drug Co., Bristol Myers Co., MCI Communication Corp.
and Volvo among its clients, said it commissioned the poll on its
own and not for any client.
   Several major advertisers, including Tambrands Inc., Ralston
Purina Co. and Domino's Pizza Inc., have withdrawn advertising from
shows such as the Fox network's ``Married ... with Children'' and
NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' because of such concerns.
   Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed said it was a ``good
idea'' for ``advertisers to stop advertising in programs some
viewers found objectionable'' while 72 percent said it was a good
idea for ``consumers not to buy products of advertisers in programs
they find objectionable.''
   Oxtoby-Smith said 49 percent of those surveyed said the amount
of objectionable material on television bothers them a lot.
   Twenty-five percent said the government should make it illegal
to show objectionable material, 36 percent said objectionable
material should be kept off the air but not necessarily through a
government ban and 69 percent called for restricting objectionable
material to late-night hours.
   The Rev. Donald Wildmon, executive director of the American
Family Association in Tupelo, Miss., which has encouraged

   In a move designed to reduce the debt load
assumed by Black &amp; Decker Corp. when it acquired Emhart Corp.,
Black &amp; Decker announced it plans to sell the Dynapert and
capacitors businesses it acquired as part of the takeover, Black &amp;
Decker announced.
   Black &amp; Decker earlier announced its intention to sell Emhart's
information and electronics sector to reduce the its debt.
   Dynapert, headquartered in Beverly, Mass., is a manufacturer of
automatic assembly machinery for the electronics industry for use
in manufacturing home entertainment, home appliance, automotive,
data processing, and telecommunications products. Dynapert, with
1988 revenues of $103 million, also has manufacturing and
engineering facilities in Japan and Germany.
   The capacitors businesses include Mallory Capicators,
headquartered in Indianapolis, and Arcotronics, headquartered in
Bologna, Italy, with manufacturing and marketing facilities in
Italy, Germany and England.
   The capacitors and signal devices manufactured by the two
subsidiaries are used in electronic circuitry in home entertainment
and automotive products, data processing and communications
equipment, computers, military and aerospace equipment, test
instruments and industrial equipment. The capacitors business
brought in $152 million in revenue in 1988.

   Henley Group Inc., which recently paid $165
million to become sole owner of an aerospace and industrial
products company, says it will invest $175 million to recapitalize
the business.
   Henley agreed in April to buy a 50 percent share of PA Holdings
Corp. from Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Inc. The purchase was
completed Thursday, Henley said in a news release.
   Henley and Wasserstein Perella paid a total of $1.2 billion to
the parent corporation of PA Holdings Corp. in August 1988, and
each received a 50 percent share in PA Holdings.
   Henley said Thursday it will invest $175 million to adjust PA
Holdings' capital structure, a project it expects to finish in July
or August.
   The company said it is recapitalizing PA Holdings in order to
bring its capital structure in line with Henley's business strategy.
   The investment consists of a $100 million capital contribution
and a $75 million payment for PA Holdings bonds.
   PA Holdings also will offer $250 million in bonds to the public,
and will restructure the $235 million in bonds issued last year
when Henley and Wasserstein Perella bought the company.
   PA Holdings will use proceeds from the public bond sale and
Henley's investment to repay approximately $400 million in
outstanding bank debts.
   PA Holdings' products include commercial and military aircraft
landing gear, aircraft flight and engine controls, and
friction-braking material for the automotive industry.

<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.2
percent in May but _ in a sure sign of a slowing economy _ job
growth fell to its lowest level in more than three years, the
government said today.
   The civilian jobless rate, taken from the Labor Department's
monthly household survey, fell 0.1 percentage point from April's
5.3 percent, in line with the expectations of analysts.
   But non-farm payroll growth, taken from a separate survey of
business establishments, was up by only 101,000, down from April's
revised growth of 206,000 jobs. The May growth was the lowest
month-to-month gain since 84,000 added payroll positions were
reported in March 1986.
   For the past three months, an average of only 160,000 jobs have
been added to non-farm payrolls each month, down from the robust
average monthly gain of 270,000 jobs reported in 1987 and 1988.
   ``The great American jobs machine is cranking down to a more
moderate pace,'' said economist Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic
Advisers Inc. ``But the economy does not appear to be headed
near-term for a recession.''
   Several analysts said after the release of the report today that
the data _ which included some signs of moderating inflation _
would give the Federal Reserve some justification for easing its
tight rein on credit, but all agreed such a move was far from
certain.
   ``For a divided Fed it's a tough call,'' Sinai said.
   In other signs of an economic slowdown, the Labor Department
said the average private-sector nonagricultural workweek fell 0.3
hours, to 34.6 hours. That decline was influenced by April figures
that likely overestimated the work week because the survey did not
take into account that Good Friday and the Easter holidays fell in
March this year instead of April.
   The average factory workweek also fell last month, slipping 0.2
hours to 41 hours while average overtime fell an equal amount to
3.8 hours, the Labor Department reported.
   And in data that will hailed be by those looking for signs of
easing inflation, average hourly wages inched up only 0.1 percent
in May following a 0.7 increase for April. Average weekly earnings
fell from April's $335.04 to $332.51 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
   The consensus among analysts was that some 220,000 jobs would be
added to the nation's economy, more than double the number reported
by the government.
   Such projections have led analysts to predict the economy would
show too much strength for the Federal Reserve to ease its tight
rein on credit. But the sluggishness demonstrated by today's report
likely will increase pressure on the central bank to relax monetary
policy.
   The service-producing industries again accounted for the
overwhelming job growth, adding 134,000 jobs to help offset some of
the declines in other economic sectors. But even that number was
well down from a revised April gain of nearly 190,000 new
service-producing jobs and well off the sector's 250,000 monthly
average gain last year.
   In that service sector, transportation and retail and wholesale
trade posted job gains but were well below their 1988 averages.
   Goods-producing industries reported a net loss of 33,000 jobs,
with mining down slightly and construction employment off by 14,000
positions. Manufacturing operations reported a loss of 18,000 jobs
from April.
   The unemployment rate dipped despite the slow job growth
because, the government said, the civilian labor force fell by
49,000 people to 123.6 million. That indicated the influx of
students into the summer labor force, generally seen in May or
June, did not occur in any great number last month.
   In a positive sign, the government said the number of part time
workers last month who wanted to work full time fell by about
300,000, to 4.8 million.
   Declines in the unemployment rate were reported for both white
and black adult men while joblessness soared among black women and
black teen-agers.
   Unemployment among white adult men fell from 4 percent to 3.6
percent in May while the rate dropped among black men from 10
percent to 9.4 percent.
   For white women, the unemployment rate last month was unchanged
at 4.1 percent while for black women it shot up from 8.8 percent to
9.5 percent.
   Unemployment for black teens climbed from 26.2 percent to 28.4
percent. The rate among white teen-agers was pegged at 11.2
percent, down from 11.5 percent.
   Among Hispanics, unemployment dropped from 8.3 percent to 7.9
percent, said the government, which does not provide a gender or
age breakdown for Hispanics.
   In a separate calculation that includes military personnel
stationed in the United States, the jobless rate dipped from 5.2
percent to 5.1 percent, the department said.
   The data included a number of revisions to previous reports
dating back to 1987 because of the Labor Department's annual review
of state unemployment records.
   Those changes included a reduction of 595,000 in the
government's estimate of job growth in the last two years.
   The report, the first comprehensive look at economic performance
last month, indicated much slower growth than most analysts had
expected, a sign the slowdown of the first quarter continues into
the second three months of the year.

   The stock market jumped ahead today, responding
to employment statistics that raised hopes for an easier Federal
Reserve credit policy and lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.25 to 2,505.88
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 781 up, 180
down and 369 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 49.74 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
increased by 101,000 in May _ only about half of the amount
projected by economists at leading brokerage firms.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
described job growth as ``very slow.''
   Traders seized on the data as evidence that the Federal Reserve
might soon relax its credit policy, seeking to cushion the economy
against the risks of a recession.
   Interest rates dropped sharply in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, rose about $10 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Texaco led the active list, up [ at 49[. The stock fell 2\
points Thursday as financier Carl Icahn unloaded his holdings of
more than 42 million Texaco shares.
   USX, meanwhile, slipped back | to 36~ after taking a 2]-point
jump Thursday. News of the Texaco transaction prompted speculation
that Icahn might be preparing a deal for USX, in which he also has
long held a large stake.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.16 to 180.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.06 at 359.15.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.48 points
to 2,490.63.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 865 up, 582 down and 513 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 223.16 million shares, up from 162.53
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>EEC to Be Vigilant on Airline Mergers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community favors
deregulation of air transportation but it will strictly control
airline mergers, an EEC official said Friday.
   European Commissioner for Competition Leon Brittan said the EEC
will be ``vigilant'' in controling airline mergers in the run up to
a single European market for air transport in the 1990s.
   ``Increased concentration in a sector which is already
characterised by high barriers to entry must be watched
carefully,'' Brittan said in a speech to the International Air
Transport Association's Aviation Symposium in Marrakesh, Morocco. A
summary of the speech was made available in Brussels.
   Brittan said that Common Market air transport market should have
less regulation, less bureacracy, more competition and cheaper
fares. But the official added that liberalization must be
accompanied by strict enforcement of anti-trust rules.
   He said the EEC did not plan to adopt the ``laissez-faire''
attitude of the U.S. antitrust authorities who have allowed
numerous mergers of airlines in the United States following
deregulation of the U.S. industry.
   Brittan made his comments amid moves by some European airlines
to cooperate more closely.
   Scandinavian Airlines System offered in April to buy a minority
stake in Sabena, Belgium's state-owned airline. Sabena is currently
negotiating a possible alliance with British Airways and KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines.
   On Thursday, Iberia Airlines said that the Spanish national
carrier will probably merge with other European airlines in the
1990s.
   Brittan said that one of the EEC's main concerns would be to
preserve and promote the position of new carriers as well as
smaller regional and charter airlines.
   ``If all such carriers were to be swallowed up through various
forms of cooperation or conglomeration with larger airlines, the
competitive atmosphere would be rather bleak,'' he said.
   Brittan also said that the EEC would have to adopt rules giving
nationals of other EEC member states the right to own shares in
airlines anywhere in the Community.
   He said that currently restrictions on the ownership of airlines
are contained in the laws and bilateral air service agreements of
almost all the EEC members.
   Brittan also said that the EEC might tighten the conditions
under which airlines are still free to share capacity and revenue.
These so-called exemptions to the EEC's competition rules expire in
January 1991.

<BYLINE>GM Stock Reaching A Stop Sign? ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The way some observers see it, the shares of
General Motors Corp. are about to send out a warning that the stock
market's strong 1989 rally might soon run out of gas.
   The analysts in question are followers of the ``GM bellwether''
indicator, one of the many traditional tools developed over the
years to try to outguess the direction of stock prices.
   The theory holds that GM stock must set a new high within four
months of its previous peak in any given market cycle to maintain
an ``all clear'' signal for investors. If it fails to do so, then
it switches to a bearish, or at least ``caution'' indicator.
   The ``all clear'' light has been on since Oct. 20, 1987, the day
after the crash on Black Monday, notes Robert Stovall of
Stovall-Twenty-First Advisers Inc., long known as a leading
advocate of the GM bellwether.
   But barring some last-minute fireworks, Stovall says, that is
about to change.
   GM's most recent peak was $47.44 (adjusted for a subsequent
2-for-1 split) on Feb. 8, 1989. The shares, trading late last week
around $41, would have to rally above their February level by
Thursday, June 8, to avoid a negative signal.
   Of course, many money managers of the investment institutions
that dominate the modern markets dismiss indicators like the GM
bellwether as quaint artifacts of a bygone time, like engraved
stock certificates or mechanical ticker-tape machines.
   If they want an ``indicator,'' thank you, they'll take a
computer-program model combining dozens of variables that suggests
changes in their Tactical Asset Allocation plans.
   Still, says Stovall, the GM bellwether has been an accurate
guide about 70 percent of the time since the 1920s, and has some
logic going for it.
   ``GM's stock is a useful foreshadower of future market trends,
because of its giant capitalization and cyclical product line,'' he
maintains. ``It is also the only blue chip stock to have, over many
years, regularly raised or lowered its dividend depending on the
corporate outlook.''
   Besides, say some other analysts, it's a potential sign of
trouble any time you see big names like International Business
Machines and GM lagging behind when the market is rallying.
   ``GM's action is especially disturbing since it looks so toppy
and vulnerable on the chart, and in addition has proved to be so
very important as a forecasting tool,'' says Stan Weinstein in the
current edition of his investment advisory letter The Professional
Tape Reader.
   However closely Wall Streeters may watch it, GM stock has been
only a fringe participant at best in the market's rise to new highs
in the 1980s.
   ``Actually,'' said Stovall, ``the shares have been better as
directional signals than as an investment over the past 20 years.
   ``GM shares at the 40 level are virtually unchanged from the
1969 price zone, while Merck has soared by eight times; Ford stock
has risen by a factor of five and IBM has more than doubled, among
many other superior long-term performers.''

   A day after its previous plan expired,
Ford Motor Co. issued a new incentive package with rebates ranging
from $500 to $4,000 and interest rates as low as 2.9 percent for
two-year loans.
   The new package, announced Thursday, includes a wide variety of
Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars and trucks.
   The plan comes in addition to one the company began May 20
covering subcompact cars. Both programs expire July 31.
   Automakers use incentives to shrink vehicle inventories. Car and
truck sales this year have been running behind last year's pace,
while production schedules have been changed only slightly.
   Analysts have speculated for months that carmakers may be forced
into widespread layoffs and plant shutdowns during the second half
of the year to further reduce inventories and give time for
retooling factories for the coming model year.
   Ford's announcement Thursday came the day after Chrysler Corp.
expanded its existing rebate program to include Jeep Cherokee and
Wagoneer models.
   There are no expiration dates on Chrysler incentives.
   Meantime, General Motors Corp.'s Oldsmobile Division announced
new incentives Thursday and its Buick Division followed suit today.
Olds ebates range from $800 to $1,500 and Buick's are between $500
and $1,500.
   Both programs also give buyers the option of cut-rate financing,
with interest rates as low as 2.9 percent on two-year loans. Other
incentives for other GM cars and trucks expire Monday.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge's Ruling Bars Future Lawsuits Over Asbestos Ailments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. bankruptcy judge's ruling allows the
transfer of most of the ownership of UNR Industries Inc. to people
who had asbestos-related claims against the manufacturer.
   About 130,000 claimants and creditors are involved in the plan,
which gives stockholders control of 8 percent of the Chicago-based
company's shares, while claimants and creditors receive 92 percent.
   The reorganization plan was overwhelmingly approved this spring
by shareholders, most claimants and creditors.
   But a group of nearly 50 claimants filed objections to the plan
with the bankruptcy court. Judge David H. Coar dismissed these
objections Thursday in approving the plan that would compensate
victims of asbestos-linked diseases and bar future lawsuits.
   There were more than 100,000 claims against UNR, whose potential
liability could exceed $875 million.
   For the first time in seven years, the company now will be
operating free of court jurisdiction.
   ``We're trying to save the company, which isn't even in the
asbestos business anymore,'' said attorney Mickey Gaynor, who
helped develop the reorganization plan for UNR, which now
manufactures steel products. ``They've been making money. It's a
very profitable company.''
   Denver-based Manville Corp. has sought similar protection,
citing overwhelming asbestos-related damage claims. But UNR
Industries' 1982 filing was the first seeking to use Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code to deal with legal claims.
   Asbestos, a fibrous flame-resistant mineral once widely used for
insulation, has been linked to lung cancer and other respiratory
ailments. The company stopped using asbestos in 1962.
   In 1968, insurance companies began denying compensation in such
cases. UNR has settled with several insurers for a total of $71.8
million and is challenging additional companies.
   UNR, formerly known as Union Asbestos &amp; Rubber Co., specializes
in the manufacture of steel tubing, shopping carts and other
products for commercial and consumer uses.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as the
market continued a turnaround begun in the previous session.
   Thursday's strong advance was largely attributed to renewed
buying by traders who had sold the market in May in anticipation of
lower prices down the road. Prices indeed fell as growing
conditions improved, and the short-sellers returned as buyers.
   Rumors of Soviet purchases of U.S. corn lent additional support
to the markets this morning.
   Soybean prices got a further boost from indications of light
farmer selling overnight and stronger European markets for soybean
meal and oil.
   Forecasts for strong thunderstorms and hail in the ripening
wheat fields of the central Plains provided some early support to
wheat futures prices.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.89} a bushel; corn was } cent
to 2} cents higher with July at $2.61} a bushel; oats were \ cent
to 1} cents higher with July at $1.72 a bushel; soybeans were 1
cent to 5 cents higher with July at $7.10} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at
68.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with August at 77.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent
lower to .03 cent higher with June at 48.27 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .27 cent to .47 cent lower with July at 30.05
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Thursday, led by

   The stock market ran up a strong gain today,
responding to employment statistics that raised hopes for an easier
Federal Reserve credit policy and lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 23.52 to 2,514.15
by noontime on Wall Street, surpassing the post-crash closing high
of 2,502.02 it reached on May 22.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,020 up,
360 down and 479 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
increased by 101,000 in May _ only about half of the amount
projected by economists at leading brokerage firms.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
described job growth as ``very slow.''
   Traders seized on the data as evidence that the Federal Reserve
might soon relax its credit policy, seeking to cushion the economy
against the risks of a recession.
   Interest rates dropped sharply in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, rose about $10 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Texaco led the active list, up { at 49{. The stock fell 2\
points Thursday as financier Carl Icahn unloaded his holdings of
more than 42 million Texaco shares.
   USX, meanwhile, slipped back ~ to 36| after taking a 2]-point
jump Thursday. News of the Texaco transaction prompted speculation
that Icahn might be preparing a deal for USX, in which he also has
long held a large stake.
   Amgen climbed 3\ to 44\ in the over-the-counter market. On
Thursday the Food and Drug Administration gave Amgen approval to
produce and sell a genetically engineered drug for treatment of
anemia in kidney patients.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.66 to 181.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.85 at 359.94.

   Eastern Airlines said today it plans ``austerity
measures'' that will include temporary changes in wages and
benefits for its non-union employees and reassignment of some
management workers to permanently replace striking machinists.
   The company declined to elaborate but did state that the changes
were aimed at satisfying creditors of the strikebound airline,
indicating wage and benefit cuts were likely.
   In a brief statement, Eastern said the changes were needed
because of financial difficulties created by the 3-month-old strike
against the carrier and its bankruptcy proceeding.
   The company scheduled an afternoon news conference in Miami to
outline what it called changes in ``wages, vacation policies and
other benefits areas.''
   Eastern spokesman James Ashlock in Miami described the changes
as austerity measures aimed at satisfying creditors as the airline
moves ahead with its recently announced plan to reorganize as a
smaller carrier.
   Because Eastern aims to reduce its workforce to 17,000 employees
after having nearly 30,000 before the strike, middle-management
positions were likely to be targeted, Ashlock said.
   ``A lot of people will be offered other positions,'' he said,
noting that many middle-level management people have been
performing new jobs to replace the striking union workers.
   Eastern currently has 4,500 to 5,000 non-union employees, most
of them in management positions, who have been running the airline
since Machinists, pilots and flight attendants walked out on March
4.
   On Thursday, an investor group seeking to buy Eastern was given
a last chance by a federal bankruptcy judge and submitted a revised
plan.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland had given the group led
by Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie until 6 p.m. EDT
Thursday to submit a business plan for Eastern to the airline and
to the committee representing its creditors.
   Ritchie said late Thursday he submitted a detailed business plan
and proposal just before the judge's deadline. He also said he
scheduled meetings with representatives of Eastern and its
creditors.
   ``I have now delivered a realistic plan for the rebirth of
Eastern that includes more-than-adequate financing, a firm
commitment to growth and the unanimous support of Eastern's
unions,'' Ritchie said in a statement.
   Lifland set another hearing for 2 p.m. today on the Ritchie
group's offer.
   The bankruptcy court wrangling is important because the strikers
want parent Texas Air Corp. to sell the airline, but Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo wants to continue to run Eastern but as a
smaller carrier. Lifland and David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed
examiner for Eastern, have considerable influence over what happens
next.
   Miami-based Eastern, one of the nation's most unprofitable
airlines, has been mired in a strike and Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection for nearly three months.
   In a separate development, Eastern agreed Thursday to pay $3.1
million to several of its employee benefit plans to settle a
federal government complaint alleging the airline tapped those
plans to pay corporate expenses. The airline entered into the
consent agreement with the government without admitting or denying
that it had committed any wrongdoing.
   And on Capitol Hill, the Senate approved a non-binding
resolution urging the bankruptcy court to consider appointing a
special trustee to replace Lorenzo in running the carrier. On a
94-0 vote, lawmakers included the language in a $3.3 billion
spending bill for this year.
   At the bankruptcy hearing, Shapiro asked Lifland to give the
Ritchie group until Monday to discuss its offer with Eastern and
its creditors. Shapiro said he didn't believe the buyout proposal
was viable but he wanted to ``lean over backwards to be fair.''
   Leaders of Eastern's unions continued to hope that the airline
might be sold.
   ``Nothing's ever the last chance,'' Charles Bryan, head of the
striking Machinists union, told reporters outside the bankruptcy
courthouse in Manhattan.
   Shapiro said he had been poised to recommend that both Ritchie's
proposal and a rival offer from a group headed by former Piedmont
Airlines Chairman William Howard be dismissed. But, he said,
Ritchie and his associates dissuaded him at a meeting early
Thursday, saying they'd raised the minimum $100 million in equity
Shapiro had earlier demanded from any potential buyer.
   Although the group had met that requirement, it still lacked a
viable business plan for running the airline, Shapiro said.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Thursday that 13 unions had
agreed to guarantee up to $5 million each to make the $50 million
available. The Eastern pilots and Machinists would determine the
use of the loan in the purchase of the airline, he said.
   Under the Ritchie proposal, Eastern's unions would have a
``substantial'' equity stake in the airline, Bryan said.

<HEAD>Continued Labor-Management Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fact that wage rates have remained in line
with other economic factors, including productivity growth and
inflation, is one of the more remarkable economic differences
between the 1970s and 1980s.
   While wage growth has intensified during the past year, perhaps
in response to a tight labor market, few analysts foresee a
wage-price spiral at all, and certainly not the sort that proved
ruinous a decade or so ago.
   By March of this year, average hourly earnings were up just over
4 percent from a year earlier, while the consumer price index, one
measure of inflation, has been running in a 4 percent to 4.5
percent range for about a year.
   Benefits add to the total cost of wages and salaries, but even
with these added the total increase in labor costs last year was
slightly under 5 percent, greater than inflation but only minimally.
   It was very different in the 1970s, when wages played a large
role in the double-digit inflation that plagued much of the decade.
   Losing faith in government's ability to restrain inflation,
organized labor sought and obtained big wage increases, reasoning
that whatever increases they obtained might be erased by inflation
in the following year or two.
   Much of heavy industry acquiesced. Rather than holding the line
on wages, management often acceded to labor's demands, confident
the added cost could be passed on to the consumer. Management was
correct.
   Consumers got caught up in the frenzy too. Fearing that existing
prices would be higher in months to come, buyers moved up their
purchase dates for big-ticket items. They were right: Prices were
higher; they helped make them so.
   Before the inflation-recession cycle was over, interest rates,
prices and unemployment at one time or another all hit double-digit
levels. It was a scene to be avoided, and for most of the time
since then it has been avoided.
   In the 1980s, the attitudes of labor and management are vastly
different. Labor seeks security and so does management, and both
feel it can best be obtained through stability _ through avoidance
of strikes and layoffs.
   Neither had much choice. The decade began with high
unemployment, which hardly is the environment for wage demands.
And, faced with greater foreign competition, management wasn't in a
position to grant increases.
   Helping to improve labor-management relations was a more stable
economic environment. Learning from its mistakes of the 1970s,
Federal Reserve policy has been directed at avoiding crises and
retaining stability.
   Unconvinced, some analysts of the economy still are watching
wages for signs of trouble, and many were surprised that wage
inflation didn't erupt when unemployment dropped below 5.5 percent
of the civilian labor supply.
   In theory, the labor supply at that level of unemployment is
hardly of the same quality as it would be with, for instance, a 7
percent jobless rate. At the higher rate, many experienced workers
generally are seeking jobs.
   Generally, as labor quality deteriorates _ as industry relies on
less skilled, less productive workers _ business costs rise. This
time they didn't, and the reasons why aren't totally clear.
   Did business simply swallow the higher costs? Why didn't
organized labor put on a long-delayed push for higher wages? Could
it be that the memories of the 1970s were too painful to risk
repeating?

<HEAD>Honeywell To Sell Semiconductor Unit To Atmel Corp.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETSY HENDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. announced Friday it plans to
sell its Colorado Springs, Colo., semiconductor unit to Atmel
Corp., a privately held company based in San Jose, Calif.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Honeywell in November
announced it was looking for a buyer for the unit, which
manufactures custom and semi-custom integrated circuits primarily
for computer producers.
   Atmel is purchasing substantially all of the assets and assuming
certain liabilities of the semiconductor unit, which employees
about 1,100 workers, said Honeywell spokeswoman Susan Eich.
   Some jobs will be cut for the sale, which is expected to be
completed this summer. Of those still on the payroll, most will be
transferred to Atmel and some will be retained by Honeywell, Eich
said.
   Honeywell said Atmel will continue to supply products and
services to Honeywell and Honeywell customers.
   Atmel was founded in 1984 by George Perlegos, who has been
active in the semiconductor industry since 1972. The company
produces non-volatile, programmable memory and logic semiconductors
for both military and commercial markets.
   Perlegos said the acquisition will help his company's growth and
will help efforts to keep semiconductor manufacturing in the United
States.
   Honeywell is an international control company that provides
products, systems and services for the home and building,
industrial, space and aviation, and defense and marine markets. The
company has 78,000 employees worldwide, with 1988 sales of $7.1
billion.
   Honeywell, which got out of the computer business in 1986, no
longer needs extensive semiconductor operations, Eich said.
   ``We don't have a strategic interest in being in the merchant
semiconductor market,'' she said.
   Honeywell has a similar operation in Plymouth, Minn., which is
being kept. It produces integrated circuits exclusively for the
company's internal use.

   A late surge left share prices only slightly lower
Friday on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished with
a loss of 0.8 point, or 0.04 percent, at 2,103.4. The index had
been down as much as 22.9 points in early trading.
   Over the past two weeks, interest rates worries have led to a
decline in the index of 102.1 points, or 4.6 percent.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended the day 0.1 point lower
at 1,745.5. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 1.03 points to
close at 1,201.40.
   Volume rose to 635.9 million shares from 512.5 million shares on
Thursday.
   Fueling the afternoon rebound was news that U.S. employment grew
at a slower-than-expected pace in May. The data, interpreted as a
sign of a slowing economy, suggested the U.S. Federal Reserve may
have greater latitude to ease monetary policy.

<HEAD>Zero-Coupon Bonds: Investment Miracle or Ticket to Doom?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investing in zero-coupon bonds, according to
whom you listen, is either a sure-fire trip to financial nirvana or
a one-way ticket to investment hell.
   ``Zeros offer probably the first chance you've ever had to take
your spare `change' and turn it into a fortune worthy of Midas,''
gushes ``Zero Coupons,'' a book on the investment. ``No longer are
we barred from making huge profits due to a lack of investable
cash. With zeros, your investment is carefree. ''
   Another investment guide, ``The Complete Book of Bonds,'' has
this bit of jaded advice about investing in zero coupons: ``If
you're anxious to part with your money, why not visit Las Vegas or
Atlantic City, where you can get some enjoyment from the
experience?''
   Zeros are bonds that lack the coupons entitling a bondholder to
periodic interest payments, hence the term zero coupon. Corporate,
municipal and Treasury bonds all are available in zero-coupon form.
   Some zero coupon bonds are originally issued without the
coupons, while others are created when investment houses ``strip''
the coupons from a bond and sell the bond and securities based on
the coupon strips separately.
   Because zeros lack coupons, holders of zeros don't receive any
current income from their investments until the bonds reach
maturity.
   To make up for this, the bond is sold at a deep discount from
its face value, or par.
   Upon maturity, the bondholder receives the face value of the
bond, and in effect receives a compound rate of interest that was
built into the bond's low original price.
   The rate of return on a zero can be substantial. For example, at
a 10 percent interest rate, a 20-year zero bought for $5,000 would
be worth $35,000 at the bond's maturity, excluding brokers'
commissions.
   But the appreciation built into the bond's price is treated as
taxable income each year even though the bondholder receives none
of the benefit until the bond reaches maturity.
   Because of this, many investment advisers believe taxable zeros
are suitable only for retirement plans, such as tax-sheltered IRAs
and Keoghs, and for company pension plans.
   Savings bonds, the best-known form of zeros, are an exception.
While the value of a savings bond appreciates over time, its owner
can elect to pay no federal income taxes on it until it is cashed
in.
   There are also tax-exempt zeros in the form of municipal bonds
that may be attractive to some investors outside of retirement
accounts.
   A major disadvantage of zeros is the potential for wild swings
in their prices on the open market compared with regular bonds.
This occurs because zeros represent an interest in a future
lump-sum payment and their interest rate is locked in.
   These price swings may make it difficult to sell a zero before
maturity except at a steep loss should interest rates rise; since
the zero has locked in a lower interest rate than the market rate,
it is worth less than you paid for it.
   Zeros once were extremely popular with parents saving for their
children's education. But the overhaul of the federal tax code in
1986 severely limited the tax advantage of this way of saving for
college tuition.
   Jay Goldinger, chief market strategist at Capital Insight Inc.,
a Beverly Hills, Calif., investment firm, believes zeros are only
suitable for investments in a retirement account.
   Outside of such a tax-sheltered account, ``the tax consequences
are just awful,'' he said.
   As for municipal zeros, he said, ``it's a disaster, unless
you're a real expert in the muni area.''
   He said municipal zeros often contain provisions that allow the
issuer to call, or redeem, the bonds before maturity. An early
redemption could drastically lower a bond's yield.
   Mutual funds that invest in zero-coupon municipals are a safer
way to invest in these bonds, Goldinger said, but only if the
investment is limited to a small aount.
   Investors also must shop around when buying zeros. Since the
interest earned is determined by how the bond is priced, investment
houses can take a generous profit on the bonds and still pay an
attractive return. Some investment houses may take a smaller profit
margin on zeros than others.

<HEAD>Liquor Industry Doesn't Fear Ad Ban, But Criticizes Surgeon General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liquor industry officials says they don't fear
the government will restrict their advertising like does for
cigarette makers, but they believe the U.S. surgeon general went
too far in a recent report calling for cutbacks in alcohol
promotions.
   ``Alcohol and tobacco are entirely different products,'' said
Patricia Schneider, director of health and social issues for the
Wine Institute, a trade association in San Francisco that
represents California winemakers.
   She said the danger with alcohol is the abuse of the product,
unlike tobacco in which any use of cigarettes can be viewed as
harmful.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop issued a set of proposals this
week aimed at curbing drunken driving. Koop recommends banning
alcohol advertisements on college campuses and halting ads that use
celebrities who appeal to youths.
   Also, he said, alcohol advertising should be matched with
pro-health and safety messages and he called for an increase in
excise taxes on beer, wine and distilled spirits.
   Aside from these proposals, government warning labels will start
appearing on alcoholic beverage containers this fall. The labels
will caution pregnant women against drinking and warn how alcohol
can impair the ability to drive.
   Government warning labels have appeared on cigarette packages
for more than 20 years and cigarette ads have been barred from
television and radio since the early 1970s.
   Producers of distilled spirits voluntarily have withheld from
broadcast advertising since the early years after Prohibition,
unlike beer and wine companies that promote their products on the
airwaves.
   Some experts say it's unlikely that advertising restrictions
similar to those on cigarettes would placed on beer and wine.
   ``If you took beer (advertisements) off TV, 50 percent of the
male population would be on Congress' necks because they wouldn't
be able to see baseball games on television,'' said Roy Burry, a
beverage and tobacco analyst at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. in New
York.
   But industry officials nonetheless say they sense political
pressure to halt broadcast ads of their products.
   ``We're concerned about people trying to ban our product from TV
and radio,'' said Stephen Lambright, vice president of
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the nation's largest brewer. ``But that
is not to say we're on a 20-year track behind the tobacco
industry.''
   The surgeon general's office, while discouraging people from
smoking, is not trying to stop people from drinking, only from
drinking and driving, said Jim Brown, a spokesman in the office.
   But spokesmen for the alcohol industry say they hear a different
message.
   ``It's a real anti-alcohol campaign,'' said Schneider, of the
Wine Institute. ``The real issue is to encourage safe drinking
habits.''
   ``We think these recommendations seek to curtail alcohol use,
not alcohol abuse,'' said Steve Forsyth, a spokesman for Miller
Brewing Co.
   Industry officials say they try to promote responsible use of
their products, but they say Koop is trying to tarnish the image of
alcoholic beverages.
   ``He's stigmatized a perfectly legal and legitimate product,''
said Lambright at Anheuser-Busch.
   It is possible some consumers who see the warning labels and
hear the surgeon general's proposals will begin viewing alcohol in
the same light as cigarettes, said Henry Pomeroy, director of
corporate communications for Hiram Walker-Allied Vintners in
Detroit.
   But people on both sides of the alcohol issue say clear
distinctions exist between alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
   ``Alcohol problems are suffered by those who don't drink, by
victims of drunken driving,'' said Pat Taylor, director of the
alcohol studies project at the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington that has pushed
for restrictions on alcohol. ``With smoking, the person most
affected is the smoker.''
   Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in
Boston who has been active in bringing liability suits against
tobacco companies, said the alcohol industry is less vulnerable
because the beverages themselves pose less of a health hazard than
cigarettes.
   Also, he said, while cigarette companies insist their products
are safe, alcohol companies acknowledge the potential for abuse.
   ``It will certainly help (the alcohol companies) look
responsible,'' Daynard said of that acknowledgment.

   The stock market advanced broadly today,
responding to employment statistics that raised hopes for an easier
Federal Reserve credit policy and lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.03 to 2,510.66
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street, surpassing the post-crash closing high of
2,502.02 it reached on May 22.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,080 up,
463 down and 436 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
increased by 101,000 in May _ only about half of the amount
projected by economists at leading brokerage firms.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
described job growth as ``very slow.''
   Traders seized on the data as evidence that the Federal Reserve

   Interest rates dropped sharply in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction

<HEAD>Government Continues Sale Of Mexico's State-Owned Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Mexican government has sold 773
state-owned companies to private investors since 1983 and plans to
continue selling non-strategic industries, the Treasury Department
says.
   The department said in a news release Thursday that the
so-called privatization process ``guarantees a maximum benefit for
the federal government.''
   It said since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office
Dec. 1, a total of 17 of companies were sold to private investors.
   Salinas announced earlier this week his administration's plan
for national development, which includes the continued sale of
state-owned companies, a fight against inflation, liberalizing
regulations on foreign investment in Mexico and a tough negotiating
posture with creditor banks to lower payments on the $107.4 billion
foreign debt.
   The Salinas government, which marked six months in office this
week, has brought inflation down to about 20 percent annually, from
last year's rate of 51.7 percent.
   Last month, the government opened the economy to foreign
investment by allowing foreign ownership in many sectors previously
restricted to Mexican ownership and increased the amount of foreign
ownership allowed in others.
   The measure was designed to attract greater investments from
abroad.
   The government is now engaged in difficult negotiations with
foreign banks to lower interest and principal on the debt.
   When the preceding administration of Miguel de la Madrid
initiated the sale of state-owned firms in 1983, the government
owned 1,155 companies.
   Business leaders in Mexico have often criticized government
control of the economy and bureaucratic interference with private
enterprise.
   As part of this divestment campaign, Salinas announced plans to
sell the government's inefficient ferry system that serves routes
to the mainland from the Baja California Sur peninsula.
   Salinas said the ferry company has drained the government of $82
million a year to make up for its losses.

<HEAD>Houston Oil Company Slapped With $5 Million Fine for Destroying Gas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. on Friday paid the government $5
million, one of the stiffest civil penalties ever levied by federal
officials, as settlement for the deliberate destruction of 1
billion cubic feet of natural gas.
   ``This is a matter of cheating the American people _ first by
wasting an important natural resource and second by not paying
America for using it,'' Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said. ``We
will not tolerate this kind of behavior.''
   Tenneco said the incident involved about 1.17 billion cubic feet
of gas over about a nine-month period ending Feb. 3, 1987.
   ``This was an isolated incident and occurred without authority
or the knowledge of Tenneco's executive management,'' spokesman Lew
Bullion said.
   ``The flaring was in clear violation of the company's corporate
policy, which is to comply with all rules and regulations governing
its oil and gas operations. There were immediate corrective actions
taken to halt the loss of gas and appropriate disciplinary measures
were taken,'' he said.
   Bullion said he did not know how many people were involved,
describing it only as ``a small group.''
   ``We are proud of our record and remain committed to a corporate
policy that mandates compliance with the letter as well as the
spirit of the rules and regulations governing our businesses,''
J.L. Ketelsen, Tenneco chairman, said.
   ``Our investigation shows Tenneco executive management in no way
condoned this,'' Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said
Friday. ``But what occurred was wrong. Tenneco management has been
cooperative ...''
   Goldstein said the $5 million fine, delivered Friday by Tenneco
to federal Minerals Management Service officials in New Orleans,
might not be the end of the matter.
   ``In our negotiations, there is ongoing dispute between the
department and Tenneco as to the value of the gas,'' he said. ``The
secretary wanted to make sure we preserved the right to collect
more royalties.''
   Tenneco estimated royalties lost because of the destruction of
gas at $115,000.
   Tenneco last year sold its oil and gas operations for more than
$7 billion. The incident cited by the Interior Department occurred
between May 1986 and February 1987 at a Gulf of Mexico drilling
platform.
   Interior officials said the gas was destroyed by ``flaring,'' a
process that burns off unwanted gas. Tenneco said the action
resulted in no health, safety or environmental damage.
   According to the department's inspector general's office,
Tenneco burned off the gas because prices were too low to make it
profitable to bring it onshore.
   The company's lease agreement with the government, however, made
Tenneco responsible for paying royalties on all gas and oil,
regardless of whether it was sold. Government officials said
Tenneco tried to avoid the payments by filing false production and
royalty reports and by disconnecting a gas meter.
   Two technicians from the Minerals Management Service, on an
inspection tour of a Tenneco offshore platform, discovered the
problem when they saw bubbling in the water _ a sign of gas being
vented.
   Under terms of the accord, which has been in negotiation for
months, Tenneco will pay the fine in exchange for the government's
agreement not to seek criminal prosecution, civil penalties or
cancel the company's lease.

   Northrop Corp. directors boosted the value of
stock options held by Chairman Thomas Jones last year, the same
year they reprimanded him for his handling of payments in South
Korea, the company's proxy statement reveals.
   Jones holds options to buy 1.2 million shares of Northrop stock
under an incentive plan. Last year, the board cut the exercise
price _ the price at which he is entitled to buy the stock _ from
$45.88 a share to $29.88 a share.
   The stock was selling for about $25 a share on Friday. But if
Northrop stock climbed back above $45.88 _ the 1987 high was
$52.62{ _ the change in the exercise price would add $19.2 million
to the value of Jones' options.
   The same proxy statement said Jones had been reprimanded for his
``management style.''
   The statement didn't explain, but the reprimand is widely
believed to stem from the company's payment of $7.8 million to
Korean businessmen and companies in an unsuccessful attempt to sell
Northrop's F-20 fighter jet to that country from 1984 to 1986.

   The dollar fell sharply Friday as U.S.
unemployment data indicated a slowdown in U.S. economic growth,
interest rates fell on the bond market and a Midwest bank lowered
its prime rate.
   ``The dollar came off rather dramatically today,'' said Bob
Morrissey, a senior currency trader with the Bank of Boston's New
York office.
   The May jobless figure showed a modest 101,000 new jobs in U.S.
non-farm payrolls, half the level expected by many analysts and one
sign that inflationary pressures are subsiding.
   Southwest Bank of St. Louis lowered its prime rate from 11.5
percent to 11 percent, although other banks did not follow suit.
   In addition, a rally on the bond market that sent long-term
interest rates to a 15-month low weakened the dollar, dealers said.
   Dealers said the unemployment figures heightened market
expectations that the Federal Reserve Bank may soon ease its
monetary policy in an effort to reverse the dollar's recent surge.
   Lower interest rates hurt the value of the dollar by making
yields on dollar-denominated investments less attractive to global
investors.
   ``If you consider the balance of risk between the Fed
maintaining its monetary policy or easing, it's clear that after
this latest set of figures the balance has shifted in favor of an
early easing,'' said Christian Dunis, a senior official at Chemical
Bank in London.
   But the Fed, he added, likely would wait for the release of
further economic data before acting.
   Francoise Soares-Kemp, a vice president at Credit Suisse in New
York, said the currency market ``was about as volatile as we've
seen in years.''
   She and other traders cited a 2 percent increase in the value of
the German mark as a key indicator of the dollar's decline.
   Ms. Soares-Kemp said currency swings were exaggerated because
many major traders stayed out of the market.
   In addition, she said, the fall was a reaction to the dollar's
steep runup of recent weeks. ``It went too far too fast,'' she said.
   In London, the British pound rose against the dollar to $1.5900
from $1.5730 late Thursday. Later in New York, the pound rose
further to $1.6040 from $1.5776 late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 141.80 Japanese yen, down from
142.52 yen Thursday. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at
141.75 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 140.50 yen from 142.41
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.9420 German marks, down from 1.9820;
1.6690 Swiss francs, down from 1.7005; 1.2055 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2053; 6.5970 French francs, down from 6.7240; and 1,411
Italian lire, down from 1,436.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included 1.9785 West German marks, down from 1.9835; 1.6850 Swiss

down from 1,442.50; 1.2063 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2068.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $362.60 an ounce
from $360.97 bid at Thursday's close.
   In London, gold slipped to $362.25 bid from $362.50 Thursday.
Gold edged higher in Zurich to a late bid price of $362 a troy

   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $366.75

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If new USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry
thought his predecessor's troubles with takeover speculator Carl
Icahn were history, he got a jarring reminder less than 48 hours
after taking charge of the steel and energy giant.
   Icahn's sale of a record $2 billion block of Texaco Corp. stock
on Thursday immediately raised speculation that he might turn his
attention to USX, which he unsuccessfully pursued in 1987.
   Corry, who succeeded retiring Chairman David M. Roderick on
Wednesday, declined comment at a news conference Friday on the
possible impact of Icahn's stock sale.
   USX, which shot higher late Thursday after news of Icahn's
Texaco stock sale, finished down $1 at $36.50 a share Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   But Wall Street analysts gave various reasons why they did not
believe a takeover bid was likely any time soon.
   Charles Bradford, of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, cited $5.1
billion in long-term debt that could become due immediately upon a
change on control of USX. That would increase the cost of a
takeover beyond the $9.4 billion market value of its stock.
   ``I really doubt that's as big a poison pill as some people
think,'' said Bruce Lazier of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben. ``If it's a
viable economic deal, the financing will be had.''
   Bradford also cited $2 billion in tax credits that the USX steel
division could forfeit if ownership changes.
   ``Icahn certainly is aware of those things and doesn't want to
lose them either. But there is a lot of other restructuring that
could be done,'' Lazier said.
   For example, USX could sell its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. for $2.5
billion that could be used to repurchase stock, Bradford said. USX
also could appease any dissident shareholder by raising its
dividends and speeding the sale of its diversified businesses.
   Icahn has advocated selling the steel division and concentrating
on oil and natural gas production. Roderick has said USX may be
willing to sell the steel unit, the nation's largest steelmaker,
but has received no offers that it considers worthy.
   Icahn acquired some 29 million shares of USX, or around 11
percent of the outstanding common stock, beginning in 1986. Late
that year he proposed a takeover at $31 per share, but USX rejected
the proposal and threw roadblocks in his way, and he withdrew the
proposal in early 1987.
   Since then, Icahn has been a highly interested but satisfied
shareholder, according to Roderick's account of their frequent
discussions over lunch and dinner.
   The sale of Icahn's 42 million Texaco shares came one day after
Roderick, 65, retired and was succeeded as chairman by Corry.
   Any corporate raider might have to pay off USX's long-term debt
under the terms of the company's lending agreements. According to
the USX annual report, lenders could declare $5.1 billion in
long-term debt due immediately upon a change in control of the
company.
   Among the $5.1 billion is $738 million in revenue from the Yates
oil field of Marathon Oil Co. that is pledged as payment on
borrowings.
   The steelmaking USS Division also enjoys about $2 billion in tax
credits that could be forfeited if the parent USX sells off more
than 20 percent of the steel division or if more than half the
company's stock changes hands, Bradford said.
   Also, said Bradford, ``Keep in mind, USX has a staggered board
of directors. If you were to make a tender offer today and you got
it all you'd get only a third of the board seats next year.''
   The sale of Icahn's Texico stock the day after Roderick left
office may have been only a coincidence. Roderick has denied
speculation that he had an agreement with Icahn to delay takeover
activity until after his retirement.
   Roderick's reputation lends credence to the speculation,
Bradford said.
   ``Let's face it, Roderick's personality was that of a fighter.
He was a Marine Corps sergeant and a semi-pro boxer,'' he said.
``Corry's background is that of a lawyer.''

   Gold and silver futures prices surged in late trading Friday,

$371.90 a troy ounce; silver was 8.8 cents to 10 cents higher with
July at $5.338 a troy ounce.
   The gains more than offset Wednesday's steep decline and
appeared to leave the gold market positioned for a further advance.
   The weakening of the dollar's value against the Japanese yen and
West German mark was the primary factor in the rally, prompting
investors to shift assets from dollars to gold.
   But the late surge in oil prices, a potentially inflationary
development, appeared to fuel some new investment buying of
precious metals, especially after the spot gold price rose above
technical resistance at about $365 an ounce. Spot gold settled at
$368.60.
   ``There are some ideas here that a short-term bottom has been
carved out,'' said Bernard Savaiko, a metal-market analyst in New
York with PaineWebber Inc. ``The market was very oversold and
looking for a technical bounce.''
   Expectations for a drop in interest rates were fanned by
Friday's national unemployment report, which showed job growth at
its lowest level in more than three years.
   Some observers say the slowdown in job creation could prompt the
Federal Reserve to ease up on interest rates in an attempt to
stimulate the economy, which could increase the threat of higher
inflation and spur more buying of gold as an inflation hedge.
   The late rally in oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was largely due to nervousness about the OPEC strategy meeting in
Vienna, Austria, analysts said.
   Little news came out of Friday's opening OPEC sessions, but many
of the traders who had sold the market earlier in the week were
reluctant to hold risky positions going into the weekend and turned
buyers late in the day.
   ``I would say a vacuum, a reluctance to sell, brought about
aggressive, nervous short-covering,'' said Jerry Samuels, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 69 cents
higher with July at $20.14 a barrel; heating oil was 1.69 cents to
1.95 cents higher with July at 50.04 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .35 cent to 1.51 cents higher with July at 64.85 cents
a gallon.
   Corn and wheat futures prices rose slightly on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid rumors of Soviet purchases of U.S. grain.
   The Agriculture Department announced after the close that China
had purchased 200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat and that more than
100,000 metric tons of U.S. corn had been sold to ``unknown
destinations,'' which usually means the Soviet Union.
   Soybeans ended lower on a continued easing of Midwestern drought
fears.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 3\ cents higher with July at $3.91\ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2\ cents higher with July at $2.62\ a
bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3\ cents lower with July at $1.68\ a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 6 cents lower with July at
$7.06{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were broadly
mixed and feeder cattle were lower, partly reflecting slack demand
on the cash markets. Pork futures were mostly lower in light,
featureless trading.
   Live cattle settled .70 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June
at 68.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent to .45 cent
lower with August at 77.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .32 cent
lower to .05 cent higher with June at 48.32 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .12 cent to .30 cent lower with July at 30.30
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Icahn: Raider or Manager?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was a time when Carl Icahn's opponents
could easily pin the label ``corporate raider'' on the takeover
strategist. But four years after Icahn bought and began running
Trans World Airlines, his image has become less clear-cut.
   Icahn has pursued a string of companies over the years,
including Phillips Petroleum Co., Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. and B.F.
Goodrich Co. His bids were largely unsuccessful, but Icahn reaped
millions of dollars in profits and became known as a raider in the
process.
   Now there is speculation his next target will be USX Corp., the
oil and steel giant in which Icahn holds a large stake and
unsuccessfully targeted for takeover in 1987. Icahn's sale of a
record $2 billion block of Texaco Corp. stock on Thursday raised
speculation that he might turn his attention to USX.
   Icahn's tactics took a different turn after he defeated Texas
Air Corp. in the fight for TWA in September 1985.
   TWA management was convinced Icahn would dismantle the airline
and sell it off in pieces for a profit. Instead, he has taken steps
to build up the carrier and improve its financial health after
years of losses.
   In February 1986, Icahn announced the airline was buying Ozark
Air Lines, a smaller regional carrier. At the time, he said the
purchase would give TWA facilities and aircraft it needed but could
not have acquired any other way.
   In an attempt to further boost TWA's size and flagging finances
he bid $1.65 billion for USAir Group Inc. in early 1987, but his
target fought him off by acquiring Piedmont Aviation Inc.
   Icahn also has considered buying Eastern Airlines, last fall and
again after Eastern went into bankruptcy court reorganization in
March.
   Icahn also is building TWA from within, announcing earlier this
year the airline was expanding and updating its fleet with
brand-new Airbus Industrie planes.
   Icahn proved a tough manager at TWA, negotiating wage
concessions with the airline's unions. When the Independent
Federation of Flight Attendants walked out in March 1986 in a
dispute over Icahn's demands for givebacks, he began replacing
strikers and they were forced to call off the walkout nine weeks
after it started.
   But his management of TWA has not meant a completely new Icahn.
   In 1986, during the flight attendants' strike, Icahn planned a
hostile attempt to buy Viacom International Inc. He ended up
selling his 17 percent stake in Viacom back to the firm in exchange
for potentially lucrative stock purchase rights.
   Wall Street analysts said Icahn likely wanted to benefit from
the entertainment company's expansion plans, but couldn't juggle a
takeover bid and his TWA problems at the same time.
   By selling his stock back to Viacom, Icahn repeated transactions
he had made many times in the past, when companies repurchased his
stock at a premium price to remove the threat of a takeover. The
practice, known as ``greenmail'' on Wall Street, branded Icahn as a
raider years ago.
   The Texaco stock sale _ the most expensive block trade ever on
the New York Stock Exchange _ gave Icahn $2.07 billion and raised
questions about what he might do with the money.
   Icahn became Texaco's biggest shareholder in late 1987, and
immediately began fighting with management, charging it was not
doing enough to raise the company's stock price.
   He proposed a takeover of Texaco valued at $14.5 billion and
tried unsuccessfully to unseat the company's board in a proxy
fight. Icahn said that if he won control of Texaco, the oil giant's
assets would be sold and the proceed would go to Texaco
shareholders.
   However, after the company undertook a major restructuring that
included the sale of billions of dollars in assets and payment of
an $8 a share special dividend to stockholders, Icahn reached a
standstill pact in which he agreed not to attempt a Texaco takeover
for seven years.
   Icahn already has a major stake in USX. He made a $7.2 billion
bid for the company in early 1987, but gave up after the USX board
rejected it. When he made his bid, there were again charges he only
wanted to drive up the stock price and profit from it, but he did
not sell his shares when he abandoned the offer.

   Energy futures prices rose Friday, led by a jump
in heating oil and gasoline prices.
   Analysts said the sharp rise in prices took them by surprise,
given the bearish undertone in the market in recent days as
investors nervously awaited OPEC's mid-year meeting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude oil grade, ended 33 cents
higher at $20.14 a barrel. The August contract rose 41 cents and
other months were even higher.
   Among refined products, the July heating oil contract rose 1.95
cents to 50.04 cents a gallon and the unleaded gasoline contract
for July delivery jumped 1.51 cents to 64.85 cents a gallon. Other
contract months also gained.
   ``There was no news and no cash reason why the market behaved
like this,'' said James R. Fiedler, vice president in charge of
energy brokering for E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. ``It
was most likely the rumor of a rumor story.''
   OPEC ministers are scheduled to open talks on Monday in Vienna
focusing on the cartel's production ceiling for the second half of
the year.
   Market observers said there was little news from Vienna, where
OPEC's eight-member monitoring committee met briefly and then
adjourned. The rally, they said, coincided with the end of the
meeting, which was intended to lay the groundwork for Monday's full
ministerial meeting.
   ``The question is why would it be so bullish,'' said Nauman
Barakat, vice president of energy investments at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``The fact that the meeting adjourned without any
contention and vitriolic statements by the Kuwaitis and the Saudis
indicates they want to find a compromise.''
   OPEC is expected to raise its output ceiling by at least 1
million barrels a day over the current 18.5 million barrels to
stabilize prices at around current levels.
   But Kuwait's insistence on a higher quota has pitted it against
its Persian Gulf neighbor, Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer.
   Barakat said that speculation that OPEC General Secretary
Subroto had arrived at a formula for resolving the differences
between the Saudis and Kuwaitis helped lift prices.
   Other analysts attributed the gains to technical factors, led
primarily by a strong rise in heating oil.
   ``Heating oil had been oversold so it had more potential to
rally,'' said Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. ``It led crude
oil and coming up to the weekend, I'm not surprised to see
short-covering.''

<HEAD>CN&amp;W Employees Make Offer For Parent Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of the Chicago &amp; North Western
announced they have submitted an offer to buy the system's parent
CNW Corp., adding a new twist to the company's fight against a
hostile takeover bid by a New York investor group.
   The Association of General Chairman, a group comprising the
leadership of the railroad's 16 unions and 6,500 members, issued a
statement saying terms of the proposal would not be revealed.
   Ed Wytkind, a spokesman for the group, said the proposal was
submitted to a committee of independent CNW board members by
Friday's 5 p.m. deadline for offers. He said the proposal calls for
employees ultimately to hold a one-third share in the recapitalized
company, with shareholders retaining the remaining two-thirds.
   ``We will not discuss the bidders or the bids received,'' CNW
spokesman James Foote said.
   Japonica Partners has offered $44 a share for outstanding CNW
stock. The New York-based investment group already owns 8.8 percent
of CNW's shares.
   CNW rose 75 cents to $46.50 a share Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Soon after Japonica launched its tender offer, CNW urged
shareholders not to sell their stock while the company searched for
other potential buyers.
   In its statement, the CNW employee group said it was undertaking
a buyout to keep CNW intact and avoid ``splintering'' of the
company's rail system, which covers 6,000 miles in nine states.
   ``We will not stand by and allow this railroad to fall victim to
the often devastating effects of leveraged buyouts,'' said Ellis
Johnson, president of the union association. ``The best way to
avoid such a fate is to take the matter into our own hands.''
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with money from the target's cash
flow or raised by the sale of its assets.
   CNW defeated Japonica's attempt to elect its own slate of
directors at the annual shareholders' meeting last month.

   Long-term interest rates plunged to their lowest
levels in 15 months Friday as investors snapped up bonds in flurry
of anticipation that the Federal Reserve might ease credit
following a weak U.S. employment report.
   ``It was a spree, a jamboree, a jubilee,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   Trading started with a bang after the Labor Department reported
the nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.2 percent in May from
April's 5.3 percent.
   Although lower unemployment can indicate stronger economic
growth _ which tends to boost interest rates _ the market
concentrated on factors in the report that underscored the view
that the economy is slowing. For example, the report indicated May
had the weakest month-to-month job growth since March 1986.
   The report sent bond prices sharply higher and the gains held
throughout the session.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond soared 1~ points, or
nearly $18.75 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in
the opposite direction, plunged from Thursday's 8.60 percent to
8.43 percent, its lowest since March 3, 1988.
   ``The report accentuated rumors all week that the Fed is going
to ease'' interest rates, said Robert Chandross, vice president and
chief economist for Lloyds Bank PLC's North America head office in
New York.
   ``The question is whether the market is expecting more than it's
going to get,'' he said.
   Indications that the economy was slowing, and thus dampening
inflation, have raised speculation the Federal Reserve might push
interest rates lower to help curb the recent rise of the dollar.
   Chandross suggested the Fed may allow the federal funds rate _
the interest on overnight loans between banks _ to trade lower. The
Fed influences the fed funds rate _ and thus other short-term
interest rates _ by adding money to the banking system or draining
it out.
   The federal funds rate traded at 9 9-16 percent late in the
session, down from 9 13-16 percent late Thursday.
   A lower federal funds rate could entice major banks to lower
their prime interest rates, a benchmark used to set interest in a
variety of consumer and corporate credit. Early Friday, Southwest
Bank of St. Louis lowered its prime rate from 11.5 percent to 11
percent, but major banks did not follow suit.
   ``If we do get some prime rate cuts by the large money center
banks, it tells the Fed that demand for money has weakened a
little, and (the Fed) will seriously consider cutting the discount
rate,'' said Jack Barbanel, senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co.
   While some experts speculated a widespread prime rate cut could
come as early as next week, they said they did not believe the Fed
would ease credit by cutting its discount rate, the interest it
charges on loans to banks, as quickly.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments rose 23-32 point to 1[ points, intermediate
maturities jumped 1\ points to 1| points, and 20-year issues were
up a full point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 10.93 to 1,165.03.
   In corporate trading, industrials moved higher. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 2.90 to 317.63.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 13-32 point. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.39 percent from 7.43 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills slipped to 8.62 percent as
the discount fell 23 basis points to 8.35 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 8.56 percent as the discount fell 26 basis
points to 8.12 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.55
percent as the discount fell 22 basis points to 7.93 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of Alar, the apple chemical
that stirred a national furor over a possible cancer risk to
children, said Friday it is taking the substance off the U.S.
market immediately.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co. continued to defend the chemical as safe
but said continued use on apples ``is causing doubt and confusion
about the safety of America's food supply.''
   Apple growers and processors had pleaded for such action because
fears about Alar had drastically cut into apple industry sales.
   The company said sales of daminozide, which is marketed under
the name Alar, would continue to about 70 markets outside the
United States, including some that export apples and apple products
to this country.
   However, a spokeswoman for the International Apple Institute
said most imported apples are green ones, such as Granny Smiths,
which are not treated with Alar.
   Supplies of the chemical held by U.S. customers may be returned
for refunds, the company said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said late Friday it has
reached agreement with Uniroyal on a plan to monitor the removal of
Alar from the U.S. market, although there is no government ban on
its use. The EPA said it also will notify foreign governments about
agency concerns about Alar.
   ``The action taken by Uniroyal will significantly reduce risk
from exposure to daminozide,'' said Victor Kimm, the EPA's acting
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances.
   The EPA has said it plans to ban use of daminozide in food
products because tests in laboratory animals have indicated the
chemical can cause cancer. Final action on the proposed regulation
is not expected until late 1990.
   Uniroyal has disputed the findings. And James Wylie, company
vice president, said Friday, ``We want to emphasize that we have
not changed our opinion about the safety of daminozide.''
   The EPA estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the U.S.
apple crop is treated with Alar, a growth regulator that improves
the apple's appearance and gives it a longer shelf life.
   Wylie, of Uniroyal, said at a news conference, ``Our voluntary
action is taken to ease public confusion and, we hope, to let the
proven scientific process work.''
   ``Daminozide has become the focus of a needless controversy that
is causing doubt and confusion about the safety of America's food
supply _ a needless controversy that is hurting the apple industry
and the American public,'' he said.
   The company indicated that it intends to resume selling Alar if
a government scientific review, scheduled to be completed next
year, concludes the chemical is safe.
   Apple growers applauded the decision by Uniroyal, but some
suggested that the company should have made the move much earlier.
The International Apple Institute estimates that growers have lost
more than $100 million because of the apple scare over Alar in
recent months.
   ``They are darn late in getting to this point. We've been after
them for a long time and consumer confidence has been affected,''
said John McAlister of Tree Top Inc., the nation's largest apple
juice maker.
   McAlister said in Yakima, Wash., that Tree Top's sales have
dropped more than 20 percent since the Alar controversy began in
February, even though Tree Top and other processors have said
repeatedly they do not use Alar-treated apples.
   ``This action is most welcomed ... since it will allay any
remaining concerns consumers may have about small levels of Alar in
apples and apple products,'' said Larry Davenport, executive
director of the Processed Apples Institute.
   Many growers have stopped using the product since concern about
its health effects gained widespread attention earlier this year.
Wylie, although not providing any specific production figures, said
sales of Alar in the United States have dropped 75 percent during
the past three years.
   Earlier this year, a report by the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private environmental group, said young children are
particularly at risk from Alar and a variety of pesticides used on
fruits and vegetables because they consume large amounts,
especially relative to their weight, of apple products, other
fruits and vegetables.
   Although the government said the levels of Alar in apples were
not hazardous, the private group's report prompted many parents to
question whether they should continue to provide apple products to
their youngsters. School districts in a number of major cities for
a time stopped providing apples in school lunchrooms.
   Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the Uniroyal decision represented ``a capitulation to
public opinion'' but that consumers could still be exposed to the
chemical because it will continue to be sold in countries that
export apple products to the United States.
   But Maureen Miklavic, a spokeswoman for the International Apple
Institute, said exposure to Alar from its use in other countries
would be unlikely. Not only are most imports green apples and thus
free of Alar, she said, but imported apple concentrates are
expected to be closely monitored by the processing industry for
possible Alar content.
   Congress is considering legislation that would prohibit the
importing of Alar treated apples.

<HEAD>Yeutter Authorizes Limited Haying and Grazing of Idled Acres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secretary of agriculture Friday
authorized additional limited relief for livestock producers with
parched pastures, and an Iowa cattlemen's group said that it was
pleased even if there were more strings attached than it desired.
   While the decision applies to 16 states with stunted pastures
and meager feed supplies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
the relief is needed most in Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska.
   The action to allow haying and grazing on lands idled under a
federal program designed to conserve highly erodable acres was
announced in Washington by Secretary Clayton Yeutter three days
after a tour of drought-stricken regions of southern Iowa.
   ``Livestock producers have exhausted stocks of hay that were
carried into winter, and they are now faced with another dry
spring. So they're out of hay and short of grass,'' Yeutter said.
   Iowa farmers with dwindling ponds, dried up wells and skimpy
pastures had urged Yeutter on Tuesday to open up land taken out of
production under the federal Conservation Reserve Program. In that
program, the government makes an annual payment to farmers who
agree to remove erodable land from production for at least 10 years.
   As of last year, 28 million acres nationwide had been placed
into the conservation reserve program and the government pays an
estimated $1.4 billion a year to participants.
   The USDA earlier had authorized livestock grazing and hay
cutting on land taken out of production under this year's commodity
programs.
   The 16 qualifying states are: California, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico,
New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.
   The emergency haying and grazing rights will be granted on a
county-by-county basis.
   County offices of the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service will submit applications to their state office
for designation as a livestock emergency and recommendations will
be made to Washington.
   Richard Vohs, an aide to Gov. Terry Branstad, said it should not
take counties long to apply for the relief.
   During last year's drought, farmers and ranchers also were
allowed to harvest hay or graze livestock on Conservation Reserve
Program acres.
   Unlike the 1988 program, however, owners will not be allowed to
donate their conservation land for use by other livestock producers.
   Other USDA restrictions on use of the conservation acres are:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
    _At least 25 percent of a field be left undisturbed for wildlife
cover.
   _No haying or grazing will be allowed on fields seeded after
July 1, 1987.
   _Participants will lose 50 percent of their government
conservation reserve payments in the next contract year.
   _Only one cutting of hay will be permitted and no hay may be
harvested after July 15. Farmers must leave at least three inches
of stubble on harvested fields.
   _Grazing will only be allowed after an inspection of the field
and will not be allowed after Aug. 1.
   _Any reseeding must be paid for by the owner and the government
will not reimburse farmers for fences or watering facilities
erected on conservation acres used for livestock.
   _Vegetative cover specifications in the conservation program
contract won't be waived because of drought.
   _Compliance spot checks will be expanded for the conservation
program.
   Maynard Jayne, field manager Iowa Cattlemen's Association in
Ames, said while restrictions were more severe than his group had
recommended, ``we are quite pleased the secretary has made the
decision.''
   One sore point with the group was the decision to prohibit
donation of haying and grazing rights.
   ``Many cattlemen do not have Conservation Reserve Program''
acreage, he said, and will be denied the extra source of forage for
their livestock.
   He also said the 50 percent reduction in rental payments is
twice the level of last year, a level the Iowa cattlemen's group
had recommended be continued.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines' ground workers overwhelmingly
accepted a four-year contract that makes its mechanics the highest
paid in the industry and includes an unusual flexible benefit
package, their union said Friday.
   The pact, which also accelerates some new workers more quickly
along the airline's wage scale, was approved by a vote of 13,103 to
4,157, or 76 percent in favor, said Transport Workers Union
spokesman Jim Gannon in Washington.
   Gannon said all locals approved the contract, ranging from a
high of 91 percent at American's home base of Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport to a low of 66 percent.
   ``This contract includes many innovative provisions that will
benefit both the company and its employees,'' American vice
president Charles Pasciuto said. ``It is a real win-win deal.''
   American's first proposal included provisions where employees
would begin contributing toward their own health insurance, a key
sticking point in earlier negotiations.
   The new contract solves that conflict with ``flex benefits,''
under which the company will allocate to each employee a certain
amount of money to be used toward benefits and the worker will be
able to select the desired coverage.
   All workers were moved up on American's 14-step pay scale. The
scale, under which it takes 12 years to reach top pay, has long
been a sore point with workers and the union had sought to reduce
the time to five years.
   Gannon said the contract also makes top-scale mechanics the
highest paid in the industry.
   During the life of the contract, a line mechanic's top salary
will rise from $18.75 per hour to $20.58 an hour, plus a $2 per
hour license premium for mechanics with two licenses.
   The agreement covers 22,000 American workers, including
mechanics, bag handlers, ground crews, stock clerks, guards,
meteorologists and aircraft cleaners.
   The contract was devised a month ago during a marathon
negotiating session between the union, the airline and a federal
mediator who had been called in after workers rejected an earlier
offer.

   Knight-Ridder Inc. has completed its sale of the
Star-News in Pasadena, Calif., and its suburban newspapers for
approximately $55 million.
   Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce Knight-Ridder's
debt, according to a statement released Thursday by Knight-Ridder.
   The Star-News was bought by Pasadena Newspapers Inc., owned by
William Dean Singleton of Houston. Singleton also serves as vice
chairman and chief executive officer of Media News Group.
   The Star-News has daily circulation of more than 38,000, and
Sunday circulation of about 43,000. Knight-Ridder purchased the
Star-News, which employs about 200 people, in 1956.
   The suburban papers included in the deal belong to the Foothill
Intercity Newspapers group. Member newspapers include the Arcadia
Tribune, the Duartean, the Monrovia News-Post and the Temple City
Times, twice-weeklies with a combined circulation of about 24,000.

<HEAD>Economy Cools Slightly In May, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The Monday AMs embargo on the following has been broken; the
story is now available for immediate use.</HEAD>

   The U.S. economy cooled slightly in May for the
first time since July 1986, in a further indication inflation could
be easing, the nation's purchasing managers said Friday in their
monthly report.
   Production by the nation's factories continued to grow, although
at a significantly slower pace than in April, according to the
report issued by the National Association of Purchasing Management.
   ``The total economy resumed its ratcheting path toward slower
growth during May as the manufacturing economy reported the first
decline in growth in almost three years,'' said Robert J. Bretz,
chairman of the trade group, based in Tempe, Ariz.
   ``Once again, expanding exports and increased capital
expenditures are providing the real growth,'' he said. ``Virtually
all indicators confirmed the slowing of the economy and, perhaps
most importantly, the sharp slowing of inflation growth along with
it.''
   The group's Purchasing Managers' Index declined to 49.7 percent
in May, down sharply from 53 percent in April, the group said. It
was the first time in 33 months the indicator had dropped below 50
percent and indicated the economy was slowing further, the group
stated.
   A reading above 50 indicates the economy is generally expanding;
below 50, that the economy is generally declining.
   ``The PMI has averaged 51.9 percent for the first five months of
1989,'' Bretz said. ``Past experience indicates that, if this
average were to continue for the balance of the year it would be
consistent with real GNP growth of about 2.5 percent, or roughly
the same as in the first quarter. The PMI would have to fall below
44 percent before signalling negative real GNP.''
   The group's price index plunged to 57.6 percent in May from 66.5
percent in April, the lowest since December 1986. Only 11 items in
the group's survey were reported up in price last month, the fewest
since February 1987.
   New orders continued to expand in May, but also at a reduced
rate, the group said. Once again, inventory buying did not supply
the growth in production; inventories decreased sharply in May for
the fifth consecutive month.
   New export orders increased in May but at a somewhat slower rate
of growth, the group said. Of the 69 percent of group members who
said they export, 25 percent reported better export orders, down
slightly from 28 percent in April.
   The 5 percent who reported lower export orders during the month
compared with 4 percent in April. The seasonally unadjusted index
of new export orders was 60 percent in May, moderately lower than
62 percent in April. The group said this indicated exports
continued to fuel economic growth.
   The group's figures are compiled through a monthly survey of
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies.

   OPEC ministers met briefly Friday before
breaking up for private bargaining over how to set new guidelines
for pricing and producing their oil.
   Twelve ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries met in a 90-minute session that preceded formal
strategy sessions set to begin Monday.
   The ministers declined to give details of their talks, which
were not attended by Qatar. OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, the
Nigerian oil minister, would only say the officials discussed ``the
whole agenda.''
   Venezuela's oil chief, Celestino Armas, said the officials would
meet again Saturday and Sunday.
   The ministers are attempting to fashion a new accord that will
guide their pricing and output policies for the last six months of
the year.
   The cartel last November reached an accord governing production
for the first half of 1989. The agreement set an OPEC output
ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day, sharply under actual
production levels of late last year, in an attempt to support a
target price $18 a barrel.
   Prices are now more than 40 percent higher than when the
agreement was made, partly due to accidents in oil producing areas
that have caused supply disruptions.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
has soared from $12.34 a barrel at the end of November to nearly
$17.70 this week, although it topped $18 earlier this year.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, closed up 33 cents at $20.14 a barrel Friday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Some officials predict the ministers may decide to extend their
current accord temporarily if they cannot reach a quick consensus.
   Some OPEC ministers have presented new ideas for an accord, but
most appear unwilling to want any changes that could upset what has
been a surprisingly strong market so far this year.
   Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister, said, ``The main
objective of the meeting is to have stability.''
   Evenness in the market, he said, ``will be brought by production
levels in accordance with demand.''
   The ministers must consider whether to maintain their production
ceiling at 18.5 million barrels a day, or boost it some to 19.5
million or 20 million barrels. Some analysts say OPEC already is
producing in excess of 20 million barrels a day.
   Affecting their decision will be estimates on demand for their
oil in the second half of the year.
   The International Energy Agency, in its Monthly Oil Market
Report, predicted demand for OPEC crude would rise to 20.4 million
barrels a day in the last six months of the year.
   If the producers agree to increase their output cap, they then
have the tricky task of dividing up the extra amount.
   Several nations, including Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
are pressing to enlarge their quotas. Ecuador and Gabon also would
like more, officials say.
   Analysts say the Saudi Arabian delegation has suggested lifting
the overall ceiling by 1 million barrels a day and giving some of
the extra to those four nations.
   The ministers also must decide whether to maintain the $18 a
barrel target price, which has been in effect since January 1987.
   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said on his arrival in
Vienna that he would suggest eliminating the reference price, but
has declined to elaborate on the plan. Nazer has said previously
that an option would be to eliminate the benchmark price in favor
of strict adherence to production quotas.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   The former president of the failed Golden
Pacific National Bank was sentenced to five years in prison
Thursday for defrauding bank customers of $15 million through phony
certificates of deposit.
   Kuang Hsung J. Chuang, 48, of Staten Island was convicted Jan.
18 on 22 counts of making false statements to the Federal Reserve,
misapplying bank funds and defrauding bank customers.
   According to evidence at trial, Chuang, who was also chairman of
the board, and the New York bank's former vice president and
cashier, Theresa Shieh, 37, of Queens, sold tens of millions of
dollars in bogus certificates of deposit, called ``yellow
certificates,'' between 1980 and 1985.
   Sales of the yellow certificates, so named because they were
printed on yellow paper, were kept off the bank's books and hidden
from federal regulators.
   The certificates were not federally insured and were used to
generate a multimillion dollar slush fund under Chaung and Ms.
Shieh's control, unlike genuine certificates of deposit.
   On June 21, 1985, the federal comptroller of the currency
declared Golden Pacific insolvent and placed it in receivership
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   About $15 million in yellow certificate funds were due customers
at the time. After a court battle, the FDIC has been treating the
yellow certificates as insured deposits and has been reimbursing
customers.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum is scheduled to
sentence Ms. Shieh, who also was convicted, on June 12.

<HEAD>Sun Microsystems Expects Significantly Lower Earnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with quotes from Sun president, analyst.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc., completing
an expensive ``bone-by-bone transplant of the skeleton of the
company'' and plagued by supply problems, Thursday forecast
significantly lower earnings or possibly a loss in its fourth
quarter ending June 30.
   A loss would be its first since it reported red ink in its
initial quarter in 1982.
   Although Sun, a leader in workstation computers, issued its new
forecast at the close of the stock market, its share price tumbled
$1.25 to $20.75 in trading on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market.
   Revenues in the fourth quarter could fall below the $497 million
of the third quarter ended March 30, the company said. That would
put the company's fiscal 1989 revenues at about $1.8 billion, up
from $1.2 billion last year.
   ``The conversion to a new management information system in April
was not without difficulties,'' the company said. ``This slowed
production early in the quarter. In addition, the introduction in
this quarter of five major new products has made it more difficult
to forecast product mix.''
   Sun said production of the new products has been ``somewhat
impaired by an insufficient supply of certain components.''
   Scott McNealy, Sun's president, declined to specify which
components were in short supply but said, ``We expect those
component shortages to not be an issue by mid-July.''
   He also declined to say which of the company's new products were
affected most by the supply shortage or to give details of how well
the products were selling. But he said the SPARCstation1, Sun's
low-cost entry into the workstation market with a starting price of
about $9,000, was ``clearly the lead product'' among the new
entries.
   McNealy said the company could be ``faulted for not being more
precise on our forecasting,'' but he said it was difficult to
predict what customers would order and how much the change in
management information systems would affect sales.
   ``Basically, we had to do a bone-by-bone transplant of the
skeleton of the company,'' he said, referring to the replacement of
a management information computer system that had been in place
since its early days with a new system.
   Delays have also resulted from continued strong sales of Sun's
traditional products, causing unexpected production demands, the
company said.
   ``These factors have hindered Sun's ability to assess accurately
the company's incoming orders, to forecast and to schedule
production efficiently,'' the company said.
   Sun said the problems will be confined to the fourth quarter and
the company is not encouraging changes in expectations for fiscal
1990, which the company said will be ``an excellent year.''
   Kathleen Hurley, an analyst at the San Jose-base research firm
Dataquest Inc., said she was not surprised by the company's
announcement in light of the ambitious product introductions made
this year.
   ``When they announced the SPARCstation I, that's a significant
revamping,'' she said. ``That affected their net income. It takes a
lot of time and money to do that.''
   She called the cost of introducing the new products and the
multimillion-dollar change of the management information system ``a
natural migration. I don't think they messed up.''
   ``I think they'll recover by the end of the first quarter (of
fiscal 1990) or the start of the second quarter,'' she said. ``The
workstation market as a whole is doing well.''
