   The Sandinista government on Tuesday
freed 29 peasants accused of collaborating with U.S.-backed rebels _
the first of about 1,200 prisoners Nicaragua has promised to release.
   The 29 were freed from a city jail in this northern town.
   ``This should coincide with the beginning of the demobilization
of the Contras (rebels) from Honduran territory and the withdrawal
of those who operate in Nicaraguan territory,'' President Daniel
Ortega said.
   He said there will be no mercy for rebel groups who do not
disband in compliance with the peace agreement signed last week in
Honduras by Ortega and four other Central American presidents.
Ortega spoke at a cermony during the release of the 29 in Pantasma,
140 miles north of Managua.
   ``He who does not accept the hand we are extending should be
prepared,'' he said.
   Under the agreement signed at the summit conference in Tela,
Honduras, the rebels are to disband by early December.
   An estimated 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents will be moved
from camps along the Honduran border and resettled in Nicaragua,
under the accords. The government said recently there are about
2,500 Contras operating in Nicaragua.
   In return for the disbanding of the rebels the government has
pledged to hold free and fair elections in February. It would be the
first free vote since the Sandinistas defeated the conservative
government of President Anastasio Somoza and gained power in July
1979.
   Ortega said the rebels ``have the opportunity to contribute to
peace in Nicaragua'' and ``avoid more suffering for their families.''
   On Sunday, Ortega agreed to a request from the National Union of
Farmers and Cattlemen to release about 1,200 peasants accused of
aiding the rebels.
   Ortega said Tuesday that 1,515 rebels and 39 former national
guardsmen in the Somoza regime are in Nicaraguan prisons.
   The government freed 1,897 former guardsmen on March 17.
   The leftis government has announced monthly cease-fires in its
war against the rebels since June 1988, when a temporary truce
between the two sides expired.
   Pantasma is located in a northern valley the rebels tried to take
numerous times but failed. In October 1983, 48 peasants died in the
fighting.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Appointment of Jay Sharbutt as a television
writer has been announced by The Associated Press, which also said
it will expand its New York-based TV staff to two writers.
   Sharbutt will join the AP on Sept. 4. He has covered television
for the Los Angeles Times since 1983. The second TV writer will be
Scott Williams, now a national editor in New York for the news
service. Williams will transfer to the television beat later this
year.
   ``This expansion of television coverage for our members is part
of a general enhancement of AP's entertainment report,'' William
Ahearn, executive editor, said Monday.
   Ahearn said Sharbutt will be AP's lead television writer in New
York, covering all aspects of the industry. He succeeds Kathryn
Baker, who resigned to pursue a freelance writing career.
   Jerry Buck will continue as an AP television writer in Los
Angeles, where John Horn also covers TV as part of a general
entertainment beat.
   For Sharbutt, 49, it is a return to the AP's TV beat, which he
covered from 1972 to 1978. He was AP's drama critic until 1983 and
then joined the Times.
   Sharbutt joined the AP in 1966 as a newsman in its Richmond, Va.,
bureau after working for The Ledger in Lakeland, Fla., and for The
Orlando Sentinel.
   In subsequent years, he served as an AP newsman in Washington,
Los Angeles, and in Saigon during the Vietnam War.
   Williams, 39, has been a member of AP's national editing staff in
New York since 1984. He has supervised filing of the national news
report, and handled feature writing assignments.
   Williams joined the AP at New Orleans in 1978 after work as a
reporter for The Fitchburg-Leominster Sentinel &amp; Enterprise in
Fitchburg, Mass.

<HEAD>The American Jeep Is Mark of Prestige to Japanese 4WD Enthusiasts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOTOSU, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese have gone wild over four-wheel
drive vehicles and on that score they have shed their prejudices
against American automobiles.
   The American-made Jeep is the mark of prestige.
   Churning up mud, bouncing over dirt moguls, mucking through boggy
sinkholes, enthusiasts careen around a 5.5-acre four-wheel-drive
playground in the shadow of Mount Fuji.
   The equivalent of a ski resort for dirt vehicles, the
pay-by-the-day Motosu Highlands course is flourishing because herds
of four-wheel-drive vehicles were banned from tearing up Mount Fuji
itself.
   But the four-wheel-drive vehicle also has become a status symbol
in Tokyo's high-fashion Harajuku district, where urban dandies
cruise around in chrome-trimmed, jacked-up, jeep-type vehicles with
the tops down, festooned with macho but unused heavy-duty winches
and fog lights.
   And in affluent residential neighborhoods, housewives load
groceries into Jeep Cherokees parked next to Mercedes Benzes and
Saabs.
   In a country eager for ever-more-stylish ways to spend new-found
cash, four-wheel-drive recreational vehicles have become the
ultimate Japanese yuppie vehicle _ and the American Jeep is the one
to own.
   While other American cars are deemed mediocre by the Japanese,
Jeeps evoke an image of American wide-open spaces and outdoor life
that many Japanese long for, says Nobuyoshi Fukushima, editor of 4X4
Magazine.
   Chrysler Jeep sales have doubled in Japan for three years in a
row, but they still totaled only 500 in 1988.
   The vast majority of four-wheel-drive cars on Japanese roads are
still domestic models, such as the Mitsubishi Pajero or Isuzu Big
Horn. And many vehicles with the genuine Jeep insignia were built by
Mitsubishi, which bought the technology from the Willis Overland Co.
more than 20 years ago, before Jeep manufacturing was taken over in
the United States by American Motors Corp. and then Chrysler.
   Four-wheel-drive vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of
Japan's auto market. For the past few years jeep-type sales have
grown 20 to 30 percent annually, or three times as fast as the
entire car market, estimates Fukushima. One in 11 of the 6.7 million
cars produced in Japan last year had four-wheel drive.
   Recreation vehicles are part of a growing leisure industry fueled
by rising incomes and longer vacations. Skiers, surfers, and scuba
divers also are avid drivers of jeep-style vehicles. But 75 percent
of four-wheel-drives in Japan never leave city streets: their appeal
is atmospheric rather than functional.
   Jeep-style vehicles with power steering, leather seats, stereos,
adjustable suspensions and automatic transmissions sell fast, and
dealers say they're getting BMW trade-ins from buyers.
   The top-of-the-line U.S. Jeep Cherokee costs about $35,000 in
Japan, more than double the price of many smaller Japanese
jeep-style cars.
   ``This is really a luxury car, for well-to-do buyers, mostly
professionals in their late 30s or 40s,'' says Masayuki Sakamoto,
director of marketing for Chrysler Japan Sales, Ltd.
   Masaaki Kuroiwa, who has been selling Jeeps and Jeep parts for
more than 20 years from a cluttered suburban garage, finds the fad a
little ironic.
   ``There's no need for these cars in Japan nowadays,'' he said.
``There's hardly any place to really drive them. It's just a
fashion, people like them with all kinds of shiny accessories stuck
on. It's a way to spend money.''
   Kuroiwa fell in love with Jeeps when they were the only vehicles
that could get around in a devastated Japan just after World War II.
As a child he admired the powerful olive-green vehicles driven by
American occupation troops.
   After the U.S. occupation forces left Japan, their Jeeps
continued to serve as all-round vehicles, especially on rough
country roads, but they nearly disappeared in the 1960s, when many
were shipped to poorer countries for another lifetime of service.
   Now Kuroiwa and others are buying vintage American Jeeps as
collectors items from the Philippines, where they are still widely
in use.
   In Kuroiwa's lot, Yuichi Tanaka, 45, proudly pats the hood of his
well-preserved Jeep, which is exactly as old as he is.
   ``It's won a lot of Jeep beauty contests,'' he said.

   He was a lawyer, investment banker, professor and
editor _ and only 32 when the plane he was in crashed in the
mountains of Ethiopia.
   But friends remember Ivan Tillem as a selfless man who overcame a
poor, troubled childhood to use his wealth to help others,
especially the young _ from disadvantaged children in Brooklyn to
starving children in Africa.
   ``When everyone else was talking, he was out there doing,'' said
Neal Schnall, his roommate on a 1986 trip to Ethiopia.
   Tillem was on the plane that crashed Aug. 7 in southwestern
Ethiopia, killing 16, including U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas.
Tillem, an Orthodox Jew, had worked on behalf of Ethiopians, Jewish
and otherwise, since 1986, helping establish a poultry-farming
enterprise.
   ``You can't save the world, but you can save one corner of it _
and in Ivan's case, several corners,'' said Barbara Ribakove Gordon,
executive director of the North American Conference on Ethiopian
Jews.
   ``It was very typical of him, that helping Ethiopia meant not
just sitting in New York and writing checks, but going there, going
to visit Jewish villages, putting drops in children's eyes.''
   Tillem's resume looked like that of someone twice his age:
chairman of the Pacific Financial Corp.; professor at Stern College
at Yeshiva University, where he was on the board of trustees;
publisher and editor of the Jewish Almanac, which he subsidized to
keep it affordable.
   ``It's hard to believe that one guy could do all these things,''
Schnall said. ``He used to say, `I don't have time to sleep. I've
got things I've got to do.' ''
   Among those things were establishing a scholarship fund for poor
students at Yeshiva University, and a fund for retarded and
disadvantaged children at Ohel Children's Home in Brooklyn.
   ``He had almost an obsession to make a difference,'' said
longtime friend Dennis Rapps, executive director of the National
Jewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs, where Tillem once
practiced civil rights law.
   As Tillem wrote in his preface to the Jewish Almanac, ``hunger,
despair, homelessness, blindness, deprivation, enslavement and
hopelessness'' exist alongside ``tranquility, order and privilege,''
and Jews should work to improve the ratio.
   ``That is `tikkun hoalam' _ repairing the world, for the world
can and should be different than it is,'' he wrote.
   ``He listened to what others had to say and spoke quietly,'' said
Karen Bacon, dean of Stern College for Women. ``But he was so
imaginative in his ideas.
   ``And all of them were directed toward solving problems of
humanity _ social problems, political problems. He had ideas for the
subways, for Ethiopia, for Haiti, for everybody.''
   The money for all this came from canny investments. Pacific
Financial's latest venture is Atlantic Air, a passenger airline out
of Atlantic City, N.J.
   ``He gave away most of his money,'' said Abe Bayer, director for
international affairs for the National Jewish Community Relations
Advisory Council.
   Tillem seldom spoke of his childhood, friends said, though it was
known his parents divorced and that he lived in a series of foster
homes before a rabbi in Queens took him in as a teen-ager. He was
unmarried.
   ``You got the sense that he had a thing for children, that what
happened to him wouldn't happen to anyone else,'' said Rapps.
   ``He was a very strange and enigmatic fellow,'' Bayer said. ``I
don't want to gloss this over. He was a loner, a restless,
imaginative and tortured soul. And it was shaped by a very poor and
traumatic childhood.''

   The farm crisis hot line is disconnected,
but officials say farmers and University of Illinois advisers who
help them are wiser because of Rural Route.
   The unique program ended this summer after 3,500 farmers called
its toll-free number seeking confidential advice about their
financial problems.
   Rural Route, which received $2.2 million in state and federal
funds over four years, has left both farmers and advisers better
prepared for the future, said Peter Bloome, assistant director of
the university Cooperative Extension Service.
   ``They have a vivid memory of a recent event that will make them
more cautious,'' he said. Farmers also have learned that farming is
a business and that they ``have a value and worth that has nothing
to do with that occupation.''
   Rural Route also taught university advisers to be aggressive in
looking for solutions to farmers' economic problems, and preparing
farmers for their future in agriculture or in some other occupation
if necessary, said Bloome.
   ``Some wanted to pretend the men in trouble were older, poorly
educated smaller farmers who were laggards at accepting
technology,'' he said. ``The opposite was true. They were young,
well-educated and progressive.''
   The hot line was unplugged July 1, although the services remain
available.
   ``Calls had dropped to one a day or less,'' said Bloome. ``The
overall financial picture for farmers was much improved, and
farmers' need for anonymity seemed to be less.''
   When the first call came into Rural Route, on March 18, 1985,
farm income was down, debt and operating costs were up, and many
farmers felt a serious economic pinch.
   Bills _ and stress _ mounted. Foreclosure loomed for some. There
was an increase in alcohol abuse, family discord, divorce and
suicide. But many troubled farmers refused to seek help because of
pride and fear of ridicule in their communities.
   Farmers were referred to counseling centers around the state, or
advisers _ always from another county _ were dispatched to their
farms.

   A man arrested for kidnapping and killing a
five-year-old girl confessed he killed two other girls in a series
of brutal murders that have shocked Japan, police said Tuesday.
   Tsutomu Miyazaki, who was arrested Friday for kidnapping and
killing Ayako Nomoto two months ago, confessed to police that he
also killed two 4-year-old girls, Mari Konno and Erika Namba.
   Police were also grilling the 26-year-old Tokyo print shop worker
regarding his possible involvement in the disappearance of a fourth
girl, 7-year-old Masami Yoshizawa of Saitama state, who vanished
last October.
   Miyazaki was in custody after being arrested July 23 for
allegedly taking nude photographs of a 6-year-old girl. He was
charged with indecent assault in the case.
   Miyazaki was re-arrested Friday on charges of kidnapping and
killing Nomoto, who he told police ``made fun of a deformity'' in
his hands. Her torso was found near a public restroom in a cemetery
northwest of Tokyo on June 11. Police discovered the girl's skull
Thursday at a location Miyazaki led them to.
   Under Japanese law, prosecutors have a maximum of 20 days to
collect evidence against him before releasing him or bringing
charges.
   ``In the most brutal murder case in postwar crime history,
Miyazaki finally confessed he killed the other two,'' the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   The new development appeared on the front pages of all the major
Japanese papers. Reporters have been camping out in front of
Miyazaki's house, as well as the victims' homes.
   In his confession statement, Miyazaki said, ``On Aug. 22, I
picked up Mari, drove her to a mountain, where I strangled her to
death. I took two pictures of her in the car. I burned her with
other things in the front yard at my house. I put her bones and
ashes in a box and put it at the front door of Mari's home,'' the
police reported the letter said.
   In February, after the box was found, letters were sent to
Konno's home and the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun by a writer
named ``Yuko Imada,'' claiming responsibility for her abduction and
murder. Investigators later found that ``Yuko Imada'' was a name of
a female detective in a comic book.
   Miyazaki told police he also kidnapped Namba, strangling her in
his car, stripping her clothes off and throwing her in the woods,
police said.
   Mitsuyoshi Maniwa, a psychology professor at Shizuoka University,
said Miyazaki could not distinguish between reality and the
fictional world largely due to his fascination with horror and
animation videos.
   Susumu Oda, a mental health expert at Tsukuba University
described the series of abductions as ``murder for pleasure.''
   ``This case involved abnormal sexual desires, especially toward
little girls, sadism, obsession for dead bodies and objects,'' Oda
said.

<TEXT>
   This communist land of comparative
plenty, long a magnet for Soviet bloc citizens seeking consumer
goods and comfortable vacations, also is becoming an escape route to
the West.
   On Sunday night, a dozen young East Germans who spent the weekend
outside the West German consulate in hopes of reaching the West
crawled into their sleeping bags for another night on the sidewalk.
   Police drove by now and then, but did not disturb them.
   Across the Danube River, a new Interior Ministry committee was
examining requests for refugee status from 10 applicants: a Soviet
citizen, a Czechoslovak and eight stranded Somalis.
   Three refugee camps for 1,400 people are being built outside
Budapest. They are primarily intended for ethnic Hungarians from
Romania, but officials say the camps will be open to all Europeans
who can prove they face persecution at home.
   One of the young East Germans said: ``We still don't know whether
we'll make it, but the way West is a lot easier from Hungary than
from East Berlin.''
   Hungary began welcoming Romanian refugees in January 1988,
breaking an agreement with the communist ally to return its citizens
who sought asylum.
   About 17,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have fled
to Hungary in the first instance of one Warsaw Pact country giving
sanctuary to citizens of another on grounds of persecution.
   Hungary's decision to take in refugees from Romania put a further
burden on the already strained relations between the two allies.
   Hungary has long maintained the estimated 1.7 million-member
ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania is subject to discriminatory
policies. Hungary also has expressed concern over a Romanian plan to
demolish villages and resettle the population. Hungary fears that
this could destroy ethnic culture and traditions.
   Romania rejects the charges as interference in its internal
affairs.
   Hungarian officials said in recent interviews the country will
not change its new border and refugee policies just to avoid
tensions with allies.
   In May, Hungary began dismantling barbed wire and other barriers
on its border with Austria. Since then, at least 1,500 East Germans
with few chances of travel to Western Europe have tried to cross
into Austria illegally through Hungary.
   Hundreds succeeded and have gone on to West Germany. Other
hundreds who failed have gone underground in Hungary or sought
asylum on West German diplomatic property.
   Police Col. Karoly Nagy urged all people who are in Hungary
illegally to leave, but also told reporters none would be ``forcibly
deported.''
   A government official said privately: ``Because this decision
expands the possibility for the East Germans to go to the West
illegally, it's clear that this decision is not among those that the
East Germans are happy about.''
   The new refugee policy, which could provide asylum to any East
European who proved persecution, is likely to disturb Hungary's East
European allies even more.
   On March 14, Hungary became the first Soviet bloc country to join
the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Refugees, which took effect
June 12.
   It commits authorities not to return anyone to a country where
his ``life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race,
religion, nationality ... or political opinion.''
   Some Western countries have applied the convention broadly,
giving asylum to most citizens of Soviet bloc countries.
   The Interior Ministry insists Hungary does not want to become a
conduit to the West, but officials formulating new laws to conform
with the convention say all cases will be heard.
   ``If an individual meets the criteria of the Geneva convention,
then we will definitely grant him refugee status, because if we
decided to accept something we have to carry it through,'' said
Laszlo Albrecht, deputy head of the ministry's refugee section.
   ``I cannot speak for the Czechoslovak or East German governments,
but in case they disapprove, what can we do?''
   Under new laws taking effect in October, each applicant will be
heard by a refugee camp panel, Albrecht said. A refugee who is
rejected may appeal to an Interior Ministry committee, then demand a
court hearing.
   Albrecht said other countries of permanent residence would be
sought for most refugees other than ethnic Hungarians, indicating
most would come from the East and go West.
   ``It's clear that not too many Swiss citizens are going to ask
for refugee status from us,'' he said, and smiled.

<HEAD>Six Months After Soviets: Najib Still in Power, Guerrillas Feuding</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after the Soviet military
withdrawal, President Najib remains in power, the U.S.-backed
guerrillas who oppose him are feuding and both superpowers are
increasing arms deliveries.
   The United States and Soviet Union have said they want a
political settlement of the 11-year-old civil war, but talks in
Stockholm two weeks ago produced no breakthrough and summer fighting
has continued.
   When the last Soviet troops crossed the Oxus River border Feb.
15, journalists in Kabul awaited the imminent arrival of the Moslem
guerrillas, as predicted by Western diplomats who had closed their
embassies and left.
   Six months later, with Najib in office and his communist
government denying rumors of an attempted coup in July, there is no
expectation of guerrillas capturing Kabul or any key provincial
capital.
   Western embassies remain closed, however. Soviet bloc and Asian
diplomats in Kabul say that is more indicative of U.S. opposition to
reaching a deal with Najib than to fear of the rockets that fall on
the city almost daily.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said Monday that
Najib, who uses only one name, has proved his government can defend
itself and is not the kind of Soviet ``puppet'' the United States
expected to fall.
   Najib has offered to hold elections, under U.N. supervision, for
a broad-based coalition government but insists his party
participate. The guerrillas reject that participation.
   ``We want a political settlement,'' Amani said. ``War brings
nothing but the killing of innocent civilians and further
destruction of our country. The war option cannot solve anything.''
   Rockets are a daily threat in this mile-high capital ringed by
mountains. Some unofficial estimates say they hit civilian targets
98 percent of the time and military targets only 2 percent.
   U.N. sources said 281 people were killed and 745 wounded, nearly
all civilians, by rockets and a car bombing between June 25 and Aug.
1.
   Residents generally blame the rockets on the guerrillas and on
the United States, which pays for them, but more and more they also
are holding the government and Soviets responsible.
   ``Both sides buy rockets and we hate both of them,'' said Salah,
an 18-year-old student, as he walked through rubble that had been a
friend's home.
   ``I think now it's time the great powers, the Soviet Union and
the United States, must accept some type of solution for
Afghanistann'' said Esmatee Wardak, president of the Women's
Committee.
   Washington and Moscow agreed to act as guarantors of the
U.N.-mediated accords of April 1988 between Afghanistan and
neighboring Pakistan, which provided for withdrawal of Soviet
soldiers and an end to outside involvement.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet forces entered the country in December 1979.
   Each side has accused the other of interfering. The United States
says the Soviet Union is shipping arms to Najib's government at the
rate of $2.5 billion to $3 billion a year, nearly double the figure
before the withdrawal.
   The United States has promised the guerrillas new weapons with
which to disable airport runways and counter high-altitude bombing
by the Afghan air force.
   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi of the Afghan supreme military council
said last week the Soviets were supplying with new MiG-29 fighters
and the latest Sukhoi-27 ground attack jets to defend against a
possible Pakistani attack.
   At least 3 million Afghans have fled to Pakistan, Afghanistan's
eastern neighbor, which Najib's government accuses of direct
involvement in the war. Guerrillas use border cities and refugee
camps as bases and supply points.
   Peter Tomsen, a U.S. envoy to the guerrillas appointed by
President Bush, predicted a major guerrilla offensive during the
fighting season, which lasts until November, but it has not
materialiized.
   ``The end is clear,'' he told a congressional committee last
month. ``Resistance will prevail.''
   Tomsen said little of the guerrillas' failure to capture the
provincial capital of Jalalabad after months of siege, and an attack
July 9 by one of the seven guerrilla groups based in Pakistan on
another.
   Members of the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's group Hezb-i-Islami, which
has received the most U.S. aid, were reported to have killed 30
field commanders and fighters of the rival Jamiat-i-Islami.
   Compounding the effections of factionalism has been the
reluctance of some field commanders to fight. Some say they resent
not being included in the exile government formed earlier this year
and are unwilling to risk their men for it.
   Najib has emphasized national reconciliation, offering autonomy
to local commanders who make peace will him.
   On Monday, he met with 60 former guerrillas who came over to the
government and said: ``Those who were fighting come together, just
like two brothers beside each other.''
   The government has yet to win over any major guerrilla commanders.
   Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Monday the security
belt around Kabul was being extended to prevent long-range rockets
from reaching the city.
   He said the zone, now about 20 miles, would be enlarged to
between 25 miles and 40 miles, depending on terrain. Amani said the
government expected the guerrillas to start using long-rante
rockets. Those now in use have ranges of 20 miles or less.

   A giant, 18-foot-long alligator is living
in Lake Okeechobee, boaters and fishermen claim, but a state
wildlife expert says he doubts it.
   ``It looks monstrous, bigger than our boat, and we have a
19-footer,'' Rebecca Dunn, who has been fishing on the lake with her
fishing-guide husband since 1966, said recently.
   ``We see it all the time,'' said Mrs. Dunn, who said she believes
the alligator is a female. ``She throws her food up in the air, way
up, then catches and eats it, mostly fish and birds.''
   Mrs. Dunn has named the alligator Hendrietta, for Hendry County,
one of five counties surrounding Lake Okeechobee, which is about 100
miles northwest of Miami and at 700 square miles is Florida's
largest lake.
   Bass fisherman Sonny Pease said he saw the creature sunning
itself on shore with its tail curled around itself like Lady
Godiva's hair.
   Pease said that when he took his boat closer to the gator, he
kept repeating, ``Oh, my God, that alligator is long. Nobody's going
to believe this.''
   When he got within about 200 yards of the big reptile, it started
swimming toward his 18-foot boat.
   It ``was all of my boat's size,'' Pease recalled.
   An 18-foot alligator would break Florida's longest alligator
record by nearly 4 feet.
   However, wildlife biologist Mike Jennings of the state Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission in Gainesville said an 18-foot-long
alligator would be highly improbable.
   The longest gator caught since records were first kept in 1977
measured just over 14 feet and weighed 714 pounds, and was trapped
last month in the Apalachicola River southwest of Tallahassee.
Trappers estimated it was 100 years old.
   The heaviest gator, caught in April near Gainesville, weighed
1,043 pounds and was 13 feet long. It took a tow truck to lift it
and three scales to weigh it.
   ``That was a very healthy gator,'' Jennings said. ``I would've
questioned it, if I hadn't seen it myself.''
   The giant gator's real length may be determined after Sept. 1,
when Florida's monthlong alligator season starts.
   ``Every hunter who has a permit will be going for him,'' said
Pease's 22-year-old son, Keith.

   A member of the ``Night Stalker'' trial jury
was shot and killed Monday in what officials said appeared to be a
domestic dispute.
   Phyllis Singletary, 30, of suburban Carson, was found inside her
apartment and her live-in boyfriend was being sought for
questioning, said Sheriff's spokesman Bill Wehner. She had been shot
repeatedly, he said.
   It wasn't known how the murder would affect deliberations in the
serial slayings trial of Richard Ramirez.
   The 12-member panel first began deliberating on July 26, after
hearing 165 witnesses during testimony that lasted six months.
   Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged
with 13 counts of murder and 30 other felony charges. Prosecutors
alleged that Ramirez is the devil-worshipping ``Night Stalker'' who
raped, robbed and murdered victims in a 1985 rampage that terrorized
Southern California.

   North Carolina State basketball coach Jim
Valvano spent more time dodging questions than answering them at a
Tournament of Champions basketball doubleheader news conference.
   The four representatives of the tournament teams _ N.C. State,
Pittsburgh, Ohio State and Oklahoma State _ gave brief speeches
Monday to start the news conference.
   When it was his turn to take the podium, Valvano immediately made
reference to the ongoing saga at his school.
   ``I can now say no comment in seven different languages,'' he
joked.
   Valvano had kept his public appearances to a minimum since the
release of ``Personal Fouls,'' a book authored by Peter Golenbock,
which contains allegations of wrongdoing in the N.C. State
basketball program.
   On Monday, he coined a phrase which ended up being his only
answer to questions on the subject.
   ``I will comment on that at the appropriate time,'' he said.
   A few minutes later, however, a determined reporter asked another
question involving the controversies surrounding the university.
   ``You really want to talk about this don't you,'' asked Valvano.
``Unless you think the `appropriate time' was in seven minutes,
that's still the answer.''
   Valvano has denied the charges against him, but the University of
North Carolina System formed a commission that conducted an
investigation into N.C. State's athletic program.
   Details of the report are to be released Aug. 25 at a meeting of
the UNC Board of Governors in Chapel Hill.
   Despite the occasional testiness, Valvano did joke some.

<TEXT>
   The opposition and government held a
third round of talks Monday on the country's political crisis in an
attempt to resolve the impasse over whether Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega will step down and who will govern the country after Sept. 1.
   The opposition is demanding that its victory in the May 7
presidential elections be recognized so it can take power when the
current terms of acting President Manuel Solis Palma and the
legislature expire at the end of August.
   It also wants Noriega to relinquish his post as chief of the
Panamanian Defense Forces, which makes him the country's de facto
leader.
   International observers said Noriega had the election annulled
when it became apparent the opposition was winning. He has resisted
more than a year of U.S. and opposition pressure for his ouster,
ever since he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in 1988 in
Florida.
   The opposition on Monday however refused a government proposal
that the two sides join in demanding an end to U.S. military
maneuvers along the Panama Canal, said Romulo Escobar Bethancourt,
head of the government delegation to the talks. No reason for the
opposition refusal was given.
   Last week there were at least 10 incidents between Panamanian and
U.S. troops near the Panama Canal.
   An Organization of American States mission that is mediating the
talks is to present another progress report on Aug. 23. The last
meeting between the two sides was last Friday.

<HEAD>Emporia Police Charge Father in Murder of Infant Boy Nine Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMPORIA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police detective haunted for years by the
supposedly accidental death of a 17-month-old boy is resting easier
since his reopening of the case led to the arrest of the boy's
stepfather for murder.
   The suspicious death of Adam Walford nine years ago was
particularly troubling to Lt. Larry Adams because Adam was virtually
the same age as his own son, David.
   ``I guess over the years I've always thought about Adam Walford
never getting a chance to grow up and do the things David has
done,'' said Adams, a 16-year veteran of the police force in the
eastern Kansas town of Emporia.
   On Aug. 19, 1980, Adam Walford died of severe head injuries
suffered at his home. Despite indications of abuse, the death was
ruled an accident.
   A new investigation started by Adams led to the arrest Saturday
of the boy's stepfather, Gurney Gerald Bartley. The 38-year-old
truck driver posted $25,000 bond and was released on a charge of
second-degree murder. Bartley is scheduled to appear Wednesday in
Lyon County District Court.
   Nine years ago, then-Sgt. Adams was one of two detectives
assigned to investigate the child's death.
   Bartley told detectives he was in the house with Adam when he
heard a thud. He said the boy had fallen off a 3{-inch step in a
doorway between two rooms. After Bartley telephoned for help, the
boy was taken to a Wichita hospital where he died three days later.
   Just a few days before, Adam had been taken to an Emporia
hospital emergency room for an ankle injury. He also had numerous
bruises, Adams said.
   Police, a doctor and relatives all suspected the boy's injuries
were not an accident.
   But Sedgwick County forensics pathologist Dr. William Eckert
somehow had been given a wrong description of Bartley's story. When
he performed the autopsy, he ruled that Adam's injuries probably
were caused by the type of accident he believed Bartley had
described. The county attorney decided there wasn't enough evidence
to prosecute and the case was closed.
   Authorities would not say what description the pathologist was
given because prosecutors plan to use it as evidence in the trial.
   In 1986, Adams received permission to reopen the investigation.
He reinterviewed dozens of people, including the boy's grandparents
and mother, who was at work when the injury occurred. The mother,
Stephanie Craver, subsequently divorced Bartley and remarried and
now lives in Georgia.
   ``The entire family suspected abuse from the very beginning. I
think that's what led to the divorce,'' Adams said. Craver has been
``very supportive and felt something had happened to her son, and
did want the investigation open,'' he said.
   Investigators also uncovered a new witness _ a longtime friend of
Bartley who told officers that Bartley told her he was disciplining
Adam when the injury occurred.
   Finally, Adams and Lyon County Attorney Rod Symmonds decided to
view the boy's autopsy, which had been videotaped as a training
exercise. It was something Adams had avoided doing the first time
around.
   ``I just did not want to see a 17-month-old cut up,'' he said.
``I should have done it, though. That was my job.''
   The viewing proved crucial, showing that Eckert had been given
wrong information.
   Adams contacted Eckert, and after reviewing the evidence the
pathologist changed his mind. His new report blamed the boy's fatal
injuries on an ``assaultive scenario.''
   ``I can't explain the feeling I got inside of me when he called
it a homicide,'' Adams said. ``All these years, I knew it was a
homicide, and now I had an expert forensic pathologist calling it a
homicide.''
   Armed with that report, confirmation from two other pathologists
and the new witness, the county attorney decided to prosecute
Bartley for second-degree murder.
   ``I'm just ready to put it to sleep and let Adam Walford rest,''
Adams said. ``I can just put this file someplace and not have to
look at it again.''

<HEAD>Minorities Under-Represented in AIDS Treatments, Doctors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many minorities infected with the AIDS virus
are not seeking new life-prolonging treatments because of a lack of
information and distrust of the medical establishment, doctors and
social workers say.
   Poor blacks and Hispanics are under-represented in AIDS clinical
trials where experimental therapies are tested, and they often don't
seek treatment until they are sick enough to qualify for free
medical care, said AIDS caseworkers attending a government
conference on AIDS and minorities.
   ``They're not as well-educated about prevention and they don't
have a cousin who is a doctor who can tell them about the latest
drug that's being tested in a clinical trial in their area,'' said
Dr. Gina Brown, an assistant attending physician in obstetrics and
gynecology at Harlem Hospital.
   Also, the poor are often suspicious of attempts to get them into
medical research, she said. Many hear only that the treatments, like
AZT, make patients sick and don't understand that the drug can
cripple the AIDS virus, said Brown, also a clinical instructor at
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York.
   One way to include more minorities in clinical trials would be to
move the trials out of the academic medical centers and into the
neighborhoods, many conference participants said Monday.
   Because much of the research on new drugs is being conducted at
universities, clinical trials are often set up in a way that
excludes poor people, said Keith Cylar, a clinical social worker and
activist with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, known as ACT UP.
Often, services like transportation and day care are not considered,
he said.
   ``Don't put the trials on Madison Avenue or at New York
University, put them in Harlem,'' he said.
   As of a month ago, 7,096 people with AIDS were participating in
clinical trials sponsored by the National Institute on Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, the chief AIDS research institute at the
National Institutes of Health. Among them were 557 blacks, 731
Hispanics and 427 women.
   AIDS activists helped start the move to community-based testing,
and the federal government is preparing to distribute $6 million in
the fall to groups that want to expand or begin such programs.
   P. Clay Stephens, an AIDS services worker from Boston attending
the conference, dismissed the often-heard reasons researchers give
for excluding women and intravenous drug users, the fastest growing
segment of AIDS cases, from clinical trials: They are unreliable
because they don't always show up for treatments.
   ``Well, are they not coming in because they're at their methadone
clinic? That's a very valid place for them to be,'' she said. ``Did
the woman not come in because her child was sick?
   ``Those concepts of non-compliance are often covers for our poor
design based on having dealt with other middle-class people who can
plan ahead and are in control of their lives in terms of scheduling
and resources,'' she said.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, whose
department is sponsoring the conference, told the opening session
that the government and local communities must do a better job
targeting AIDS prevention messages to minorities.
   He said the messages must be ``culturally relevant and
sensitive,'' but he added that ``community standards must be
respected'' in educating about the disease that is often transmitted
through sexual contact.
   As of July 31, the total number of Americans diagnosed with AIDS
reached 102,621, of whom 59,391 have died since July 1, 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   Blacks, who comprise 12 of the U.S. population, represent 26
percent of adult AIDS cases in the United States and 53 percent of
pediatric cases, he said. Hispanics, who make up 7 percent of the
nation's population, represent 15 percent of adult cases and 23
percent of pediatric cases.

<TEXT>
   Industrialist Armand Hammer, pardoned by
President Bush for making illegal campaign contributions to Richard
Nixon's 1972 campaign, says the president's action reinforces his
faith in the American legal system.
   White House spokesman Bob Hall confirmed Monday night that Bush
had pardoned the 91-year-old Hammer and nine other people whose
names were not released. The White House usually does not announce
its action on pardons.
   Hammer, who pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976, released news
of his pardon in Los Angeles.
   ``Having spent my lifetime fighting injustice, this vindication
reinforces my abiding faith in the American system of justice,'' he
said in a statement issued Monday through his Occidental Petroleum
Corp. ``I deeply appreciate President Bush's action in clearing my
name.''
   Hammer spent several years seeking a pardon, and there had been
speculation that President Reagan would grant one in his last days
in office.
   Hammer originally pleaded guilty in Washington to a criminal
information filed by the Watergate special prosecutor to three
misdemeanor charges of making $54,000 in illegal contributions to
the Nixon campaign.
   But the judge threw out the plea after Hammer wrote a 20-page
letter to his probation officer blaming former Montana Gov. Tim
Babcock, an Occidental Corp. vice president, for the contributions.
   Babcock was convicted of concealing that Hammer was the true
source of the money.
   In 1976, Hammer left a hospital bed in a wheelchair and hooked to
a cardiac monitor to enter another plea in a Los Angeles court.
   ``I'm pleading because I'm guilty,'' he told the judge at the
time.
   Hammer was sentenced to a year's probation and fined $3,000. The
judge said he spared Hammer a prison sentence because of his
precarious health.
   Hammer was a self-made millionaire by the time he graduated from
Columbia University Medical School at 23, having taken over his
father's pharmaceutical business four years earlier.
   After graduation, Hammer went to the Soviet Union to negotiate a
business deal, and wound up with a concession for an asbestos mine
and a pencil factory.
   Proud of having met every Soviet leader since Lenin, Hammer has
devoted much of his fortune to collecting great art, research on
cancer and promoting world peace.
   Hammer's money sent American physicians to treat victims of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Better times on the farm are boosting sales of
new tractors and other machinery, the Agriculture Department says.
   Another reason for the increased sales is the relative scarcity
of good used machines. For years, because of tight finances, farmers
had to do with what they had. Thus, says the department's Economic
Research Service, many farmers who might be in the used market are
turning to new models.
   ``Sales in all categories of new farm machinery are expected to
expand in 1989,'' the agency said in a report. ``Farmers appear to
be continuing a trend toward using larger tractors.''
   Analysts said sales of four-wheel-drive tractors are expected to
grow the most this year, up 65 percent from 1988, followed by a 23
percent increase for the larger two-wheel-drive models, those of
more than 139 horsepower.
   Sales of combine harvesters and hay balers are also expected to
gain about 22 percent each this year.
   Overall, farmers are forecast to spend $6.2 billion to $6.7
billion on machinery this year, the third consecutive annual
increase, report said. Last year's expenditures rose to $6.03
billion from less than $5.8 billion in 1987 and $4.6 billion in 1986.
   Machinery sales rose to a record of almost $12 billion in 1979
before sliding seven consecutive years to the 1986 level.
   ``Weather conditions weakened sales growth in 1988, but are not
expected to play a significant role this year,'' the report said.
``Higher net cash income, lower real interest rates, and reductions
in outstanding debt began boosting farm machinery expenditures in
1987 and will continue to increase sales through 1989.''
   Rising land values also are improving farmers' financial
standings, enabling them to replace aging farm machinery.
   Another factor this year is a larger planted acreage, triggered
in part by last year's drought-reduced harvests and rising market
prices of some of the major commodities.
   ``An expansion in planted acres increases the return a farmer
receives from the machine, because it is used on more acres,'' the
report said. ``Furthermore, greater planted acreage makes machine
down time more costly because more acres must be worked within the
same time frame.''

   A defensive war against Africanized honeybees
has helped slow the northward march of the insects across Mexico,
the Agriculture Department says.
   Popularly called ``killer bees'' by some, including movie
writers, the migrating bees were expected to reach the southern
United States in 1987 or 1988. Then, maybe 1989 or 1990.
   But department officials now say the bees won't reach the Rio
Grande Valley of southern Texas ``for another 18 months or later.''
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said Monday that a joint project
with Mexico has delayed the bees' arrival and ``should give
researchers and beekeepers enough time to study the bee and learn
how to manage it.''
   The Africanized honeybee is the hybrid offspring of European
honeybees and pure African queen bees brought to Brazil in 1956 for
research. The African queens escaped and began interbreeding with
native honeybees.
   Africanized bees have been migrating northward since then and
were found in southern Mexico in 1986. Today, they are about 400
miles south of the U.S. border near Tecolutla, Veracruz, Mexico.
   Although the venom of Africanized bees is no more potent than
that of the European bees that are common throughout the United
States, the hybrids can be more dangerous because of their
aggressiveness and the likelihood of them stinging in greater
numbers.
   Besides the notoriety as a fierce pest around humans and animals,
the Africanized honeybee also is feared by many commercial
beekeepers for what it might do to their industry.
   Glosser said his agency began working with the Mexican government
two years ago in a cooperative program to control the Africanized
bees.
   The program includes the detection and tracking of the bees as
they near the U.S. border; trapping and destruction of swarms to
reduce their numbers; and efforts to alter the bees genetically to
they pose less of a threat.
   ``Program personnel in Mexico have hung almost 60,000 traps in
the last 18 months and have caught more than 11,000 swarms of
Africanized bees,'' Glosser said. ``That's millions of Africanized
bees that will never reach the United States.''
   The project in Mexico also uses ``requeening'' to reduce the
transfer of Africanized traits to regular honeybee colonies.
   Beekeepers are encouraged to select queens from desirable genetic
stock and mark them with a bright paint so that it's easy to tell if
they are in the hive. If an unmarked queen is noted, that female is
replaced with a marked queen known to be of good genetic stock.

   A quarterly report by the Agriculture
Department says the number of workers employed by farmers showed a
seasonal increase in July, but dropped slightly from a year ago.
   The hired work force on farms was estimated at 1,197,000 during
the week of July 9-15, up from 830,000 in April. In July 1988, the
work force was 1,200,000.
   That did not include 351,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In April, those
totaled 198,000 workers, and in July 1988 they were estimated at
303,000.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.23
per hour, up from $4.90 per hour a year earlier but below the
average of $5.35 in April, the report said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage rate
available. However, workers in California were reported at $5.80 per
hour, compared with $6.45 in April and $5.74 a year earlier in July
1988.
   Florida workers averaged $5.55 per hour, compared with $6.24 in
April and $5.19 a year earlier.

   Eastern Airlines officials say they are
changing some of their business procedures after agreeing to pay a
$75,000 fine for alleged federal consumer violations.
   The Department of Transportation said Monday that the financially
hobbled carrier agreed to pay the civil penalty ``to avoid costly
litigation,'' but was not conceding guilt. The alleged violations
occurred in 1986 and 1987.
   It could take the government years to pocket the funds, however,
because Eastern has been under the protection of federal bankruptcy
laws since March 9, five days after the strike against the carrier
began.
   When a bankruptcy judge approves a schedule for repaying
creditors, the payments might take years.
   The DOT charged the airline with taking more than the required
seven days to issue credit-card refunds to customers. It also
accused Eastern of not informing some consumers that flights listed
by the carrier were operated by independent commuter airlines with
agreements with Eastern.
   Eastern officials said little about the settlement. But
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the company had ``changed our
procedures to better comply with DOT regulations.''
   DOT officials said Eastern uses an express delivery service to
speed the shipment of refund claims to its Miami headquarters.
   Northwest Airlines agreed to pay a $325,000 fine in November
1987, the largest ever. Continental Airlines _ like Eastern a
subsidiary of Texas Air Corp. _ agreed to pay a $250,000 penalty for
similar charges in June 1987.
   Eastern filed a reorganization plan with the federal bankruptcy
court July 21. Its goal is to emerge from reorganization by the end
of this year.
   Under the agreement with the DOT, the government would receive
its payment after all creditors have been repaid but before
Eastern's debts to Texas Air are repaid.
   If the agreement isn't approved by the court by Nov. 30, it would
be voided and the government would have to renew its efforts to
press its case against Eastern.
   Sam Podberesky, a DOT assistant general counsel, said the fine
could be repaid in the next few months or could be delayed until
sometime in the 1990s.
   Typically, he said, fines levied against financially healthy
airlines are paid within anywhere from 15 days to two years. Claims
against carriers in bankruptcy can take years, he said.
   Eastern, which operated 1,100 flights daily before the strike,
operated 350 flights Monday and planned to increase that to 390
Tuesday, Ceremsak said.

   Rep. Mickey Leland's crusade against hunger
will live on despite his death, says House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
but there appears to be no obvious successor to carry the torch.
   ``There will be a determination on the part of members of the
House to work for those goals that Mickey Leland sought to achieve _
the alleviation of hunger and suffering here and in Africa and
elsewhere in the world,'' Foley said Monday.
   However, Foley, D-Wash., didn't say who would become chairman of
the House Select Committee on Hunger, the panel Leland founded in
1984. Leland, a Texas Democrat, died in a plane crash last week
while on a fact-finding mission in Ethiopia.
   Foley aide Jeff Biggs said a new committee chairman was not
expected to be named until next month when Congress returns from a
month-long recess.
   Leland's efforts were credited with getting $800 million in
relief for victims of famine in Africa.
   ``Whenever a member wanted to do something (on hunger) they would
go to him,'' Miranda Katsoyannis, chief of staff of the hunger
committee, said Monday. ``This committee served as a focus. The
Congress became more sensitive as a result.''
   Leland parceled out responsibilities and several members of the
committee were leaders in specific areas, Katsoyannis said.
   The senior member is Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who shared Leland's
concern for hunger in the Third World. Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y.,
another committee member, was one of Leland's closest associates and
among the first to go to Ethiopia to strengthen search efforts last
week.
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., is known for his work with the hungry
of Central America, while Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., has been a leader
in nutrition efforts among the rural poor of the United States. Rep.
Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, is known for his work on hunger problems
among the Hispanic poor.
   Seniority rules don't apply to select committee chairmanships
which, like standing committees, are made by the speaker.
   Select committees don't act on legislation, but do initiate
studies, hold hearings and influence other committees to make
changes or additions to the federal statutes.
   ``Select committees at their best, offer us a flexibility and a
sense of focus that we may otherwise not find in our standing
committees,'' House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said
during debate in February on whether to continue the committees.
   Leland said during the same debate that his committee's work was
extensive during the 100th Congress.
   ``Thirty-two hearings, nine basic human needs seminars and
numerous briefings were held; nine reports were published and
monthly status reports on international and domestic hunger were
issued and widely distributed,'' he said.
   The House Select Committee on Hunger was instrumental in setting
up the Child Survival Fund, part of the U.S. foreign assistance
program. It also provided impetus to expanded research into the
effects of vitamin A on child mortality.

<HEAD>Congressmen Seek to Curb Pentagon in Rulings on Exports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several members of Congress are making a new
bid to curb the Pentagon's power to stop exports of high-technology
goods, but defense officials say the limits are needed to keep
equipment out of communist hands.
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., and others say the Commerce Department
should oversee shipments of goods with both military and civilian
uses, as long as the goods are not being sold to the Soviet Union,
China or other Communist-ruled countries.
   ``I think it makes sense,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., who
heads the subcommittee on international trade in the House Foreign
Affairs Committee. ``I can't commit myself now, but I`ll be glad to
look at a proposal.''
   Supporters of the Commerce Department on the issue include Sens.
John Heinz, R-Pa., and Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., and Rep. Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb.
   Members interested in changing the trade rules worry that the
Defense Department is overzealous in blocking exports. They see U.S.
business losing sales to foreign competitors when more sales are
needed to reduce the trade deficit. At the current rate, the trade
deficit will be $111 billion this year.
   The Defense Department, however, has told the General Accounting
Office its work on export licenses has ``resulted in denial of
license application to known diverters in Pacific Basin countries,
at an estimated value of approximately $200 million.''
   Sensitive goods shipped to allies have sometimes reached Soviet
hands. The Japanese government found that Toshiba Machine Co. had
sold the Soviets sophisticated machinery capable of silencing
submarine propellers. At one point, some members of Congress showed
their anger by destroying a Toshiba radio with hammers on the
Capitol lawn.
   When Congress returns from vacation next month, AuCoin and other
advocates of the change will sound out opinion in both Houses.
AuCoin represents a district where there are many high-technology
companies.
   The new effort in Congress would not keep the Pentagon out of
decisions on exports that go directly to communist-ruled countries,
or on exports of purely military goods.
   The countries on which the Pentagon would continue to have its
say include Cuba, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, East
Germany, Romania, Alania, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia.
   The House voted last year to let the Commerce Department oversee
exports to non-communist countries of technology with non-military
uses, but the Senate would not go along.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher won a decision from President
Bush against the Pentagon last month on a similar issue, enabling
American manufacturers to ship higher-powered computers to the
Soviet Union as well as to other countries _ despite public
opposition from Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.
   ``We did have a difference inside the administration on this
question,'' Bush told reporters at the time. ``This will not
endanger the legitimate national security needs of this country.''

<HEAD>US Gives Assurances to PLO in a New Round of Talks</HEAD>

   The United States, pledging to keep talking to
the Palestine Liberation Organization despite deep policy
differences, says it aims for a Mideast agreement with Israel that
promotes Palestinian political rights.
   A conciliatory statement issued Monday in Washington and Tunisia
sought to repair the recent rift between the Bush administration and
Yasser Arafat's group while also urging the PLO to approve an
Israeli election plan.
   The statement by U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau Jr. said the
United States seeks a settlement based on Israel giving up territory
in exchange for peace. Also listed as ``firm principles'' in the
U.S. statement were ``security and recognition for Israel and
Palestinian political rights.''
   The statement did not say how those rights would be expressed.
   ``Our immediate task ... is to find a practical means to
translate these principles into political reality,'' it said.
   The PLO demands a state on the Israeli-held West Bank and in
Gaza. U.S. policy opposes statehood, and would have Israel and
Palestinians negotiate an arrangement acceptable to both sides.
   ``The Palestinians should have a chance to determine their own
future in negotiations with Israel as well as to run their daily
affairs,'' said a U.S. official who demanded anonymity.
   Meanwhile, Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, pledged
the United States would keep talking to the PLO to try to get
negotiations started.
   ``We don't expect a breakthrough in each particular meeting,''
Boucher said in announcing that the talks begun last December had
resumed in Tunisia. ``It's an ongoing process.''
   The department last month accused the PLO of attaching
unacceptable conditions to its provisional approval of an Israeli
proposal for elections on the West Bank and in Gaza. One was the
demand for statehood.
   The Bush administration supports the Israeli proposal to choose
elected Palestinian representatives for negotiations as the best way
to get talks started. The PLO, however, has denounced the proposal
as a ploy to block Palestinian statehood.
   Last week, the department again criticized Arafat's organization.
Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said a statement adopted by Fatah, the
main PLO faction, raised questions about the PLO's ``commitment to
accommodation, understanding and peace.''
   Delegates to a Fatah meeting in Tunis, where the PLO maintains
its headquarters, had approved a resolution calling for
``intensification of the armed struggle and all other forms of
battle to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian
territories.''
   On Monday, the department took a different approach through both
spokesman Boucher and envoy Pelletreau.
   Boucher said Pelletreau had met in Tunisia with a PLO delegation
headed by Yasser Abd-Rabboo and again sought ``a positive
Palestinian response'' to the Israeli election proposal.
   ``We continue to believe that through an Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue progress can be achieved in moving the process forward to
elections and peace negotiations,'' he said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, while disapproving of U.S.
talks with the PLO, proposed elections to select Palestinians who
would negotiate temporary and limited self-rule with Israel. After
five years, Israel, Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan would negotiate
an overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   The lengthy statement by Pelletreau called Monday's session
``serious and probing'' while offering assurances to the PLO that
the Bush administration seeks to foster political rights for
Palestinians.
   ``There is a road to peace in the Middle East,'' it said. ``We
are suggesting that the next, but not the last, milestone on that
road is an election in the occupied territories.''
   In Tunis, Abd-Rabboo said he expected the discussions to continue
in ``the near future'' and said an international peace conference
was ``the best introduction to establish an effective peace.''

   The Bush administration is upset that the
Soviet Union ignored two high-level U.S. appeals to change its plans
to test a long-range missile that passed near the Hawaiian islands.
   ``There was no danger, but there is always a risk, however
slight,'' a U.S. official said Monday after Friday's 8,000-mile
flight of an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile was
disclosed.
   The missile didn't pass over land while flying over the island
chain, but a U.S. official said the point of the complaint was that
``it was too close for comfort.''
   The missile was launched from the Tyuratam installation deep in
the Soviet Union and splashed down some 1,250 miles south of Oahu,
officials said.
   Two U.S. officials told The Associated Press the missile had
passed over waters between two tiny Hawaiian islands, Neckar and
Nihoa. A third official confirmed that the Soviets conducted the
test Friday despite U.S. appeals that it posed potential political
and safety problems.
   The Soviets announced Aug. 7 that they intended to conduct a test
between Aug. 11 and Aug. 21, but neither of the two private U.S.
appeals to Deputy Ambassador Serge Chetverikov nor the test itself
were made public.
   ``It's somewhat disturbing the Soviets didn't take our concerns
into account,'' a U.S. official said Monday. ``There was no danger,
but there is always a risk, however slight, it might be that
something would go awry. That is why we felt it was inappropriate.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond R. Seitz and his deputy,
Curtis W. Kamman, held separate meetings last Monday and Tuesday
with Chetverikov to complain that the missile was likely to pass
over the Hawaiian Island chain before splashing down in the ocean.
   Seitz and Kamman are the senior officers in the State
Department's Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs.
   ``The U.S. government expressed its deep concern to the Soviets
over the planned test and asked that it be modified,'' a U.S.
official said.
   Chetverikov returned to the State Department on Wednesday to say
the test would be conducted strictly over water, not over any U.S.
territory. He said it would involve only international airspace and
water.
   ``We did not find that response persuasive or sufficient, because
the Soviet missile test would pass over the Hawaiian Island chain,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It is not
a legal issue but an issue of political and safety considerations.
Once again, we strongly urged the Soviets to reconsider their
plans.''
   Two years ago, in a similar situation, the Soviets revised a
missile test near Hawaii when the Reagan administration objected.
   In the U.S. appeals to the Soviets, the planned test was
described as a ``provocation,'' said another U.S. official, who also
requested anonymity.
   U.S. relations with the Soviet Union have been on the upsurge on
most fronts, although there have been recent disagreements over U.S.
assistance to rebels in Afghanistan and Soviet overtures to Iran.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze will meet in Wyoming next month to plan a summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   China's ambassador to the United States, whose
tenure marked a steady expansion in U.S.-Sino relations until the
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, is ending his
tour with meetings and parties.
   Clues to how the administration and corporate America view China
two months after troops marched into Tianamen Square may be found in
the attendance at Ambassador Han Xu's farewell reception at the
Chinese Embassy on Wednesday.
   Han has invited an array of officials, businessmen, academic
experts and diplomats. China-watchers will size up the
representation and observe which members of Congress, on vacation
for the August recess, return to Washington for the affair.
   President Bush said after the Tianamen Square massacre that
relations with China were important and that dialogue would continue
in the hope that Chinese leaders would end repression.
   However, the president said it would not be ``business as
usual,'' suspending military and top-level exchanges.
   Han, 65, has made farewell visits to Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, four other Cabinet members and other senior officials. No
meeting is scheduled with Bush, who knew Han Xu when he headed the
U.S. liaison office in Beijing.
   Han's call on Baker last Friday was ``strongly personal, based on
a friendship that they've had for many, many years ... a one-on-one
meeting,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   The Chinese Embassy said Han and Baker ``expressed a desire to
preserve and develop'' U.S.-China relations.
   Han, in meetings with U.S. officials since June, has faithfully
echoed his government's line condemning U.S. criticism of its
pro-democracy crackdown as interference in internal Chinese affairs.
   A State Department expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said U.S.-China relations had been moving ahead until June. But he
said the United States had continued to communicate with Han.
   ``How are you going to tell them you're upset about things if you
don't talk to them?'' he asked. ``Nothing has altered our dismay
about events, but the way to express that view is to have contacts
at a sufficient level so you know you're getting through.''
   Han also paid farewell calls to Secretary of Agriculture Clayton
Yeutter, Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft, Senate Democratic and Republican Party leaders George
Mitchell and Bob Dole and other senior officials, the Chinese
Embassy said.
   Former President Nixon, who met Han during his historic 1972 trip
to China, gave a dinner Aug. 3 for the ambassador, said Nixon aide
John Taylor.
   Han, who has been in Washington for more than four years, will be
replaced by Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen.

<TEXT>
   Supporters and detractors of Richard C. Breeden
agree his nomination as chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission could define the Bush administration's response to the
internationalization of financial markets.
   President Bush on Monday named Breeden, point man on the new
multibillion-dollar plan to bail out the savings-and-loan industry,
to head the five-member SEC.
   ``He's an important member of the Bush team. It seems to me that
Bush has placed a high priority on the SEC,'' said Lee Polson,
executive director of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, a national organization of state-level securities
regulators.
   Joseph R. Hardiman, president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, said Breeden ``would be one who would be readily
acceptable to the securities industry and one who would readily
resolve the issues'' facing the industry.
   The White House announcement ended speculation about a successor
for SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, who announced in May that he was
stepping down.
   The SEC post requires Senate confirmation.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the securities
subcommittee, said the challenges faced by the commission include
``growing internationalization of financial markets and whether the
SEC will have adequate resources in the 1990s.''
   ``I look forward to the committee's hearings on Mr. Breeden, and
to the opportunity they will afford to closely examine the Bush
administration's plans in a number of key areas,'' Dodd said in a
statement.
   Created in 1934 during the Depression, the SEC oversees
securities markets and regulates the sale of stocks, bonds and other
securities as part of its mission to keep the markets honest while
protecting investors.
   Most recently, Breeden served as one of the architects of the S&amp;L
restructuring legislation, submitted in February, and guided it
through Congress. The final plan, a sweeping rewrite of banking laws
and the largest single-industry government bailout, was signed into
law by Bush last week.
   Securities industry leaders and Republicans generally hailed
Bush's choice, but some Senate Democrats were less enthusiastic.
   ``I think it's a splendid appointment,'' said Roderick M. Hills,
a former SEC chairman under President Ford.
   ``It's going to be a very hard time at the commission in these
next few years,'' said Hills, now in private legal practice in New
York. ``The focus is going to be different. Our companies are going
to seek capital abroad and foreign companies are going to be seeking
capital here.''
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, also praised Breeden's intelligence and work on the
savings and loan bailout but said, ``He brings a limited direct
market experience to this critical assignment and that is a matter
of some concern when the SEC faces a time of epic challenge.''
   Breeden, a 39-year-old lawyer and banking specialist, said
through an aide he will not speak with reporters until after his
Senate confirmation.
   Breeden, whose job as presidential assistant for issues analysis
made him something of a White House trouble shooter, also helped
fashion administration policy for dealing with the Alaska oil spill.
   Breeden was deputy counsel to Vice President Bush from 1982 to
1985.
   Earlier, he was a securities specialist with a New York law firm,
and between government assignments worked in the Washington office
of a Houston law firm.
   He was also directed a task force on deregulation headed by Bush
as vice president, and wrote the panel's report on the deregulation
of financial services.
   But Polson said he saw no irony in a former deregulator's
appointment to a major regulatory agency.
   ``When Chairman Ruder was picked, he was widely characterized as
a deregulator, too,'' said Polson ``I don't think it's useful in
determining how he's going to perform as chairman of the SEC.''
   Bush announced he would nominate Breeden to the commission seat
held by Charles C. Cox, whose term has expired. After Breeden's
confirmation by the Senate, Bush would immediately designate Breeden
as the new chairman.
   Ruder said Monday he plans to resign effective Sept. 30 unless
Breeden is confirmed before that. His resignation would create
another vacancy on the commission.

<HEAD>Progress Made in Hostage Contacts: Fitzwater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says a breakthrough on
negotiations for the release of American hostages in Lebanon most
likely is months away.
   ``We think generally the progress has been significant,'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   However, Fitzwater said he would not equate progress on the
diplomatic front with the eventual release of the hostages.
   ``Those two elements are a long way apart, so I would not compare
the two,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the United States had gleaned ``considerable
amounts of information'' from contacts with other countries. Asked
if information was being received from Iran, he replied, ``from all
sources.''
   The United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran
but has been communicating through third-party contacts, such as the
Swiss government.
   Asked what he meant by ``significant'' progress, Fitzwater said,
``We're not prepared to say, but (it is) in the general issue of
understanding the problem better, improving relations and hopefully
to get some kind of break down the road.
   ``I think we're looking at a long-term situation, months, not
weeks.''
   Fitzwater declined comment on a statement by Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that Iran will never hold talks with
the United States. Shortly before Khamenei made his statement, Iran
renewed an offer to help free the hostages.
   Fitzwater said the contradictory statements ``typifies why we
would not like to react to every comment that is made.''

   It was hardly a typical time capsule _ black
vinyl packed with lipstick, makeup and old photos.
   It was a purse that had been stolen Oct. 18, 1970.
   Construction workers in an old department store being converted
to apartments found the purse behind a storage cabinet last
Wednesday. The money was gone, but there was an address book with
some telephone numbers.
   After 18 years and 10 months, Alice Wilson had the purse she had
long since given up for lost.
   Inside was her driving learner's permit, photos of her high
school sweetheart and her high school girlfriends, her Social
Security card, voter registration card and lipstick and makeup.
   ``It brought back memories,'' said Wilson, who had been working
in the department store when the purse was stolen.
   She said the thief took $60, her weekly pay. The bag apparently
was tossed on the tall, wooden cabinet in the basement of the store.
And there it stayed until the workers moved that cabinet.

   Julian Lennon is running hard to escape the
shadow of his famous father, John.
   The 26-year-old singer told US magazine in its Sept. 4 issue that
his voice, which is similar to his father's, from now on will be
heard on songs that are ``a lot more raw and a lot more opinionated
lyrically.''
   ``I've used my shyness in the past to avoid issues and keep my
opinions quiet. I'm not tired of being nice, but there is more to me
than that,'' he said.
   Lennon hopes his third album, ``Mr. Jordan,'' will help him
recover from his second album, ``The Secret Value of Daydreaming,''
which he called ``a disaster.''
   Lennon's first album, ``Valotte,'' won him a Grammy nomination
for best new artist.
   Lennon said that during the the 1986 release of ``Daydreaming''
he ``was pressured and contractually obligated to write a hit in a
short period of time.''
   Since then, he said, he changed management and stopped doing
drugs.
   ``I'm not the dumb kid I was two years ago,'' he says. ``A lot of
decisions hadn't been made in my best interest, and I felt like I
was being packaged. In one way, it was because of my ignorance and
naivete. I haven't got a cent of what I earned from my first two
albums.''

   Alan Paley, an actor with television
credits going back to ``Surfside Six'' and ``Sea Hunt,'' faces
attempted armed robbery charges after suffering a gunshot wound.
   Paley, 54, who on his acting resume lists ``experience with
police .38,'' allegedly used such a weapon trying to stick up a
stranger wearing a Rolex watch and gold ring in a hotel restroom
last week, police say.
   Fort Myers golfing executive William Donald, 55, said he wrestled
the gun away and chased Paley with it, shooting him in the abdomen
as he climbed into his car. ``He was a pretty good actor,'' Donald
said. ``Maybe that's why he felt he could rob me.''
   Paley took off in his car but surrendered to police an hour
later, according to authorities. He was released Saturday from Coral
Springs Medical Center.
   He apparently had problems with his work in the insurance
business and was unemployed, said police Sgt. Howard Smith.

   A 111-foot yacht belonging to Super 8 Motel
chain co-founder Ron Rivett was beached to keep it from sinking, the
Coast Guard said.
   There were no injuries, but the Bonheur, which has a helicopter
pad and is reported to be worth more than $1 million, was damaged
extensively.
   The vessel was pumped out and refloated early Monday but Coast
Guardsman Ronald Morris said in Juneau, ``You get something like
that and you have to rip everything out and start from scratch,
except for the hull.''
   The vessel lost a propeller and shaft and began taking on water
Saturday about 35 miles northeast of Sitka on Peril Strait, Morris
said. The crew lowered launches to push the Bonheur up against old
piers; at high tide nearly the entire main deck was under water.
   A tug was sent to tow it to Sitka where Rivett and his family
were vacationing.

<HEAD>Judicial College Teaches Judges How to Better Fight War on Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Outrage over drug-related crime has spawned
calls for more police and prisons, but a school for judges hopes to
teach jurists to wage war on drugs with treatment rather than tough
jail terms.
   The National Judicial College is launching an instructional
program to show judges how to handle criminals who have drug
problems.
   ``There's an onslaught of drug-related cases coming into the
courts right now across the country,'' said Thomas Russell,
assistant dean of the Reno-based institution.
   ``What we're trying to do is teach judges patterns of drug use
and about evaluation and treatment programs so they don't just order
criminals to be locked up every time.''
   One judge in each state has been invited to enroll in the
inaugural one-week program, which begins Sunday, Russell said. At
least 44 judges selected by each state's chief judge plan to attend.
   The course will become a regular offering next March at the
judicial college, whose alumni range from local judges to Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The school offers short courses, mostly lasting one to four
weeks. They range from basic instruction for new appointees to the
bench, to retraining for experienced jurists. The private school,
located on the University of Nevada's Reno campus, is funded by
state and federal grants, as well as tuition.
   Chicago Circuit Court Judge Michael Getty, one of the main
instructors for next week's course, said he aims to teach jurists to
recognize when it would be better to sentence a criminal to
treatment instead of prison time.
   ``Neither the penitentiary nor probation by themselves are an
adequate response to this country's drug crimes problems,'' Getty
said.
   In Chicago, for example, Getty said judges sometimes sentence
non-violent criminals who have drug problems to residential or
non-residential treatment programs along with community service.
   ``The recidivism rate for treatment programs is not as high as if
you send them to prison,'' he said. ``From that point of view, these
types of programs are a tremendous success.''
   That message appears to stand in contrast to increasingly
strident calls for tougher law enforcement.
   Last week, U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh outlined the
Bush administration's $1 billion crime-fighting package, including
harsher penalties for the criminal use of guns, ending plea
bargaining in such cases, hiring more investigators and prosecutors
and doubling space in federal prisons.
   Getty said drug-using criminals who commit violent crimes must
pay through incarceration.
   ``I'm not advocating that all drug offenders not go to prison,''
he said. ``But there are a significant number who ought to be placed
in treatment programs rather than prisons.''
   According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 62
percent of the 605,000 people in state and federal prisons in 1988
used drugs regularly before they were incarcerated.
   Of those, 27 percent used drugs daily, according to Donna
Hunzeker, criminal justice program manager for the national
lawmakers group. Twenty-two percent were under the influence of
drugs while committing the crime for which they were sentenced to
prison, she added.
   ``The studies show that drug use accelerates criminal behavior,''
Ms. Hunzeker said.
   Russell, the assistant dean, said he hopes that by treating
people for drug problems, crime can be reduced.
   ``Part of the solution to reducing the high crime rate is to find
the problems and deal directly with them,'' Russell said. ``The role
of the judge will be to recognize when the problem is drugs.''

   Twenty years ago today 400,000 people
descended on Max Yasgur's farm for a giant celebration of music and
youth, but residents near the site of the rock festival say this
time they're being invaded by reporters.
   ``Swedish national radio just interviewed me,'' said Arthur
Schubert, 62, who worked as a security officer at the festival.
``That makes Hong Kong, Brazil, London and some guy from Germany,
too, today. That doesn't even count the Americans.''
   Schubert is doing media relations for a Woodstock reunion
festival this weekend in nearby Swan Lake, and reporters made up a
big part of the crowd at the Woodstock site in upstate New York.
   Besides reporters, about 200 people were camping at the site,
Sullivan County sheriff's deputy Paul Pratti said Monday.
   Campers strummed guitars, bought food from vendors and watched
movies on videocassette recorders powered by portable generators.
   Police were expecting more people to arrive through the rest of
the week in the town of about 3,000, but not too many, County
Sheriff Joseph Wasser said.
   ``It's not like we're expecting an onslaught,'' Wasser said.
   The Aug. 15-17, 1969, concert is seen by many as marking the peak
of a decade of social change in the United States. The crowd
gathered at the site since Saturday included some original
festival-goers and others not even born then.
   The weather was the same as 20 years ago _ rainy _ as were
conditions on the field now owned by Charley and Debbie Gelish _
muddy.
   While Bethel is planning no official remembrance on Woodstock's
20th anniversary, the Imperial resort hotel in Swan Lake is staging
a ``Remember Woodstock'' concert Thursday to Saturday featuring such
Woodstock alumni as Melanie and John Sebastian.

<HEAD>Panamanian Bank Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering, Fined $5 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian bank was ordered to pay the United
States, Canada and Switzerland a record $5 million fine after
pleading guilty to federal charges that it laundered $411 million
for a South American cocaine cartel.
   Banco de Occidente of Panama, where two managers allegedly
conspired with the Medillin cartel, entered its guilty plea Monday
before U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley.
   The $5 million fine was the largest ever imposed by a federal
court against a bank for drug-money laundering, said U.S. Attorney
Robert L. Barr Jr. The conviction was the first of its kind
involving a foreign bank with no U.S. operations.
   The guilty plea resulted from a plea bargain between prosecutors
and the bank, which had faced a maximum penalty of fines totaling
$10.5 million and forfeiture of an amount equal to assets identified
as cocaine proceeds.
   Canada and Switzerland, which helped in the two-year
investigation dubbed Operation Polar Cap, each will receive $1
million of the fine, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced in
Washington. The fine-sharing arrangement was the first of its kind,
Thornburgh said.
   ``This international cooperation in the war against drugs sends a
message to drug traffickers everywhere that it is going to be harder
for them to hide their ill-gotten profits, and easier for us to
recover them,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said.
   ``The bank pled guilty because of the activities of two people in
one branch office,'' said William Richey of Miami, an attorney for
the bank.
   Richey said drug-profit transfers slipped through the bank
unnoticed because the bank ``exists to transfer funds. It's a trade
bank.''
   According to prosecutors, the general manager and a commercial
manager at a Banco de Occidente of Panama branch were bribed by
members of the Medellin cartel. The Colombian ring reportedly
accounts for up to 80 percent of the cocaine entering the United
States.
   The bank is a subsidiary of Banco de Occidente of Cali, Colombia.
   The money was sent out of the United States and ``laundered''
through wire transfers, transactions used routinely to exchange
large sums of money.
   To conceal cocaine profits, the money launderers, posing as
jewelry dealers, exchanged gold-painted lead bars among themselves
to generate phony gold bullion transactions, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Wilmer Parker III said during Monday's hearing.
   Parker said informants and undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents posing as money launderers penetrated the
Medellin cartel and met several times with its leaders.
   ``The significance of this case cannot be overestimated,'' said
Barr. ``We have dealt a significant blow _ certainly not a death
knell, but a significant blow to the ability of the cartel to meet
its major problem in this country ... what to do with the vast
amounts of cash.''
   The bank pleaded guilty to one count of aiding cocaine
trafficking through money laundering and to one count of conspiracy
to defraud the United States.
   Acting under the agreement, the bank on Monday paid by check the
$2 million of the fine being split by Canada and Switzerland. The
bank agreed to pay the remaining $3 million over the next four years.
   O'Kelley noted that Banco de Occidente of Panama lists a net
worth of only about $7 million.
   He said the fine represented a substantial share of the bank's
capital. ``The court has some question as to the ability of the bank
to survive a penalty more severe,'' the judge said.
   The general manager, William Guarin, and the commercial manager,
Clara Garcia, remain under indictment.
   Part of the fine will be applied to a special federal fund
allowing the money to be used for prison construction and anti-drug
expenses.
   Under legislation enacted in 1986, the United States can seize
property owned or under the control of narcotics traffickers even
when the actual profits are no longer available for seizure.
   ``Moving the assets of illegal drug trafficking out of one bank
account and into another can no longer cover up the illegal act,''
Thornburgh said. ``It is like fingerprints that cannot be brushed
away.''

   Mickey Leland's widow could take over her
husband's House seat almost without opposition, but some politicians
are pondering a race for the post if she chooses not to run,
observers say.
   ``So many people know her personally and out of respect for
Mickey and her, she could walk in,'' Jack Carter, Harris County
Democratic Party chairman, said of Alison Leland.
   ``In the great Southern tradition, it's the wife who would come
forward,'' said Robert Stein, a political science professor at Rice
University. ``If Mickey Leland's wife is in there, you're not going
to have anyone running against her.''
   Mrs. Leland is a 30-year-old investment banker with Shearson
Lehman Hutton. Observers also noted that she is two months pregnant
and has a 3-year-old son.
   ``I would think her first concern is her health and child,''
Stein said.
   Members of Leland's family have remained in seclusion since the
wreckage of his plane was found Sunday in a remote area of Ethiopa.
   ``She is a very strong young woman, but she has been badly
shaken,'' said the Rev. William Lawson, a family friend. ``All in
all, she has been extremely courageous and she has taken it
extremely well.''
   Gov. Bill Clements has not made a decision on a special election
date. It must be held on or before Nov. 7.
   If Mrs. Leland chose to succeed her husband, she would not be the
first.
   In October 1972, a plane carrying Hale Boggs, a Louisiana
Democrat and then House majority leader, crashed in Alaska. Boggs'
wife, Lindy, was elected to his seat in 1973 and continues to serve.
   If Mrs. Leland chooses not to run for the seat, three Houston
councilmen with ties to Leland are among the most likely candidates,
observers said.
   Rodney Ellis, a former top Leland aide and close friend, was
viewed as the strongest candidate, Stein said. Other potential
aspirants include Anthony Hall, a friend who lost a 1978 runoff
against Leland, and Ben Reyes, another Leland friend who went to
Ethiopia to be close to the search.
   ``Everybody in Houston is reluctant to discuss this, out of
respect for Mickey and his family,'' Carter said. ``But the
practical side is that of the people who have looked at the district
before _ the two named most are Hall and Ellis.''
   Ellis is out of his office this week and has not discussed
running for the seat, said Rhonda Belt, his office coordinator. Hall
said it was inappropriate to comment on a possible race this soon.

   The U.S. dollar opened higher but fell slightly in
Tuesday afternoon trading against the Japanese yen, while share
prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange firmed.
   The dollar opened at 142.40 yen, up 0.47 yen from Monday's close
of 141.93 yen, and moved between 142.20 yen and 142.70 yen. It
finished at 142.20 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which declined
41.34 points Monday, added 139.07 points, or 0.40 percent, to close
at 34,810.69.
   ``There was no market-affecting news'' this morning, said a
foreign exchange dealer at The Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank.
   He said the Bank of Japan had intervened during the morning
session but with little effect.
   ``The dollar is robust,'' but should not rise over 144 yen, he
said.
   The dealer predicted the market would not fluctuate much the rest
of the week, which is a holiday for many market participants.
   The stock exchange firmed in the morning session, even though the
volume of transactions was only 200 million shares, said a trader at
Nomura Securities, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``High-tech stocks and steels were the focus'' of this morning's
trading, he said.
   High-tech ``is very important to Japanese future growth. As for
steels, they are very important for infrastructure expansion and
should be bought in large amounts, but until now they were being
sold cheaply,'' he said.
   He also said machine issues such as Yamatake-Honeywell firmed on
a report in the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun that said
orders for machine tools had increased 30 percent the first six
months of this year.

   Gary Dotson, finally cleared of a rape that his
one-time accuser later said she invented, says he's bitter over the
agony the legal system put him through.
   ``It's a good system but mistakes happen,'' Dotson said Monday
after a judge overturned his conviction. ``I have my bitterness,
yes. It has been hard to deal with.''
   After the judge acted, prosecutors dropped charges that could
have led to a new trial, saying they could not win the case again.
   As the hearing ended, Dotson turned and smiled at his relatives
in the audience, then heaved a sigh of relief.
   ``It's over,'' Dotson told reporters. ``As they say, this is the
first day of the rest of my life.''
   Dotson was convicted in 1979 of the rape and aggravated
kidnapping of Cathleen Crowell Webb and was sentenced to 25 to 50
years in prison. Dotson had served six years of the sentence when
Mrs. Webb, now a Harrisville, N.H., homemaker, said she invented the
1977 attack because she feared she had become pregnant by her
boyfriend.
   ``I forgave her a long time ago. I've no animosity against her,''
Dotson said. ``As far as I'm concerned, today my name has been
cleared.''
   Mrs. Webb's attorney, John McLario, said she was pleased with the
dismissal of charges and wondered ``why something like this wasn't
done long ago.''
   ``She trusts that it will be put to rest and she naturally wishes
the best for Gary,'' McLario said. ``She is very sorry for the part
she had in this unfortunate situation. When she came forward in 1985
she never anticipated it would be a four-year odyssey.''
   Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald granted Dotson a new trial
based on genetic tests which prove his semen could not have made the
stain in Mrs. Webb's underpants _ the key in his conviction.
   Prosecutor Gayle Shines moved to dismiss the charges against him,
citing conflicts in Mrs. Webb's statements and the difficulty in
disputing the genetic test. Ms. Shines also said it was uncertain
that Dotson would have to spend more time in jail if convicted again.
   Ms. Shines said the state ``absolutely (does) not'' owe Dotson an
apology.
   ``He was tried by a jury of his peers,'' she said. ``I don't
believe a mistake was made.''
   But Dotson's attorney, Thomas Breen, said the only conclusion was
that Dotson was falsely convicted.
   ``Gary's going to have to live with the horror of knowing that he
was incarcerated all those years for a crime he never committed,''
Breen said.
   Dotson, 32, who married and became a father since his release,
was paroled last August after recurring minor problems with the law
returned him to prison.
   He has two months left in an alcohol and drug treatment center,
and said the program has changed his life.
   ``It's hard for us to take a look at ourselves,'' Dotson said.
``I feel more confident in myself. For the first time in 12 years I
can take responsibility for my own actions.''
   He plans to attend college this fall, and train to be a drug and
alcohol counselor, he said.
   When Mrs. Webb recanted her testimony, Gov. James R. Thompson
granted Dotson clemency, saying his punishment had been sufficient.
But the governor refused to pardon Dotson, saying he did not believe
Ms. Webb's reversal.
   ``I wish him well,'' Thompson said after Monday's hearing. ``I
hope he will be able to conquer his alcohol dependency and live a
normal and productive life.''

   A 7-year-old boy shot and wounded his
5-year-old playmate as they imitated characters in the movie
``Robocop,'' police said.
   Ronelis Frendeles was in guarded condition late Monday after
being wounded in both legs by a single gunshot, said police
spokeswoman Lori Nedzweckas.
   The 7-year-old, whose name was withheld by police, found the
.38-caliber handgun in the trunk of his uncle's car. Police
described the shooting as accidental but said it remained under
investigation.
   The shooting occurred outside the older boy's home across a
parking lot from the police department in Lake Worth, abou 60 miles
north of Miami, while the child's mother was grocery shopping about
12 blocks away.
   The 7-year-old told police he was imitating the half-man,
half-robot character in the movie ``Robocop.''
   Under a Florida law set to take effect Oct. 1, adults who fail to
secure a loaded weapon that is used by a minor in an accidental
shooting could be charged with a felony. The charge carries up to
five years in prison.

   An Army observation helicopter crashed
and burned in a wooded area of Fort Bragg early today, killing the
three soldiers on board, said a base spokesman.
   The OH-58A Kiowa helicopter was on a routine training mission
when the crash occurred at 12:10 a.m., Maj. Doug Foster said.
   Names of the victims were witheld pending notification of
relatives, Foster said.
   He said an investigation will be conducted to determine the cause
of the accident.
   It was the second wreck in less than a week involving military
aircraft on Fort Bragg.
   On Wednesday night, a C-130 from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas,
crashed during an exercise here, killing one crewmember and injuring
six others.

<HEAD>Judge Rules DNA Test Inadmissible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled that genetic tests linking a
double-murder suspect to a slain pregnant woman and her toddler are
inadmissible as evidence at trial.
   State Supreme Court Justice Gerald Sheindlin on Monday urged
lawyers in previous DNA cases to re-examine their trial records to
see if appeals were warranted on the basis of his opinion, believed
to be the first of its kind.
   Genetic tests have been used in at least 80 cases of rape and
murder in 27 states.
   Sheindlin found that a genetic testing company, Lifecodes Corp.,
had failed to properly perform DNA tests.
   The tests were ordered after Joseph Castro, who is charged with
killing a pregnant woman and her 2-year-old daughter, told police in
a statement that blood found on his wristwatch was his.
   Experts witnesses concluded that the blood on the watch was not
Castro's blood, but said the tests showing the blood was that of the
slain woman were not conducted properly.
   Sheindlin said the flaws made the Lifecodes test inadmissible as
evidence.
   ``The testing laboratory failed in several major respects to use
the generally accepted scientific techniques and experiments for
obtaining reliable results, within a reasonable degree of scientific
certainty,'' the judge said.
   Ed McCarthy, a spokesman for District Attorney Robert Johnson in
the Bronx borough, said the prosecution conceded there was a flaw in
the testing.
   Vilma Ponce and her daughter were murdered on Feb. 5, 1987. A
trial date has been set for Sept. 11.

<HEAD>Exxon Valdez Moving Into Drydock For Nine Months Of Repairs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers will get their first look at the
damaged hull of the Exxon Valdez after the crippled tanker goes into
drydock for a nine-month repair job.
   The Exxon Valdez was scheduled to be moved during the afternoon
high tide today from Pier 6 at the National Steel and Shipbuilding
Co. to the dock from which it was launched in 1986, said NASSCO
spokeswoman Debby Torbol.
   Actual repairs were likely to begin in September, because it will
take time to remove water from the repair dock so the ship can be
examined in detail.
   ``I suspect there will be a two-week period in which the only
people in there will be lawyers and engineers,'' said NASSCO senior
vice president Al Lutter.
   Repair costs are estimated at $25 million, but the shipyard's
director of support services, Dick Grothen, said the price tag could
change after a thorough inspection of the damage.
   Dockmaster Frank Russell, a veteran of more than 40 dockings,
said he will coordinate the vessel's movement by using up to eight
tugs while monitoring the tanker's position through a team of divers
and surveying instruments.
   The 166-foot wide Valdez, which spilled about 11 million gallons
of crude in Alaskan waters when it hit a reef March 24 in Prince
William Sound, must squeeze inside a dock with just three feet of
clearance.
   ``It's the first time NASSCO has done this,'' Russell said.
   Exxon Shipping Co. officials have said they plan to return the
987-foot-long tanker to service, possibly under a different name,
after repairs are completed.
   Nearly one-third of the ship's bottom either is gone or has been
severely weakened, and 24 brackets had to be welded to the hull so
the tanker wouldn't collapse under its own weight in drydock.
   After being towed 2,000 miles from Prince William Sound, the
Exxon Valdez waited offshore for three weeks after officials
detected oil slicks around it. Before the ship could navigate the
42-foot-deep channel of San Diego Bay, divers removed massive steel
slabs that dangled from the hull as far as 70 feet below the surface.
   The ship finally arrived at NASSCO on July 31.
   Though booms have remained in place since then to contain
possible spills, NASSCO officials say no discharges or slicks have
appeared.

<HEAD>Trial Judge Rules Judges Retain Fishing Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of the Abenaki Indians said a
judge's decision to grant the group fishing rights is one step
toward winning back land claimed by the tribe.
   ``This victory is for fishing rights,'' said tribal chief Homer
St. Francis. ``Now we'll be fighting for our land.''
   The ruling by Vermont District Judge Joseph Wolchik recognized
the Abenaki's aboriginal fishing rights dating back 11,000 years.
   It dismissed fish and game violations filed two years ago by the
state against several tribe members. The state contended the
tribespeople had no right to fish without the state license required
of other people.
   The Abenakis number about 2,500 and live primarily in
northwestern Vermont.
   Wolchik said the state failed to prove the tribe ``abandoned or
ceded their Missisquoi homeland or that their aborginal rights were
extinguished by either an express act or an act clearly and
unambiguously implying any sovereign's intent to extinguish those
rights.
   ``Accordingly, the Missisquoi's aborginal right to fish in their
Missisquoi homeland continues to exist today,'' he wrote.
   Although the ruling dealt only with the issue of fishing rights,
Gabor Rona, the tribe's lawyer said ``what makes this so monumental
for the Abenakis is that the issues the court needed to address and
did address in this fishing case are precisely the same as would be
addressed in a land claim.''
   But it was not clear whether the special status that Wolchik
granted the tribe would translate into anything more than the right
to fish.
   The judge found the Abenakis do not meet the federal definition
of a dependent Indian community, a finding that could impact any
future land claims.
   ``The available evidence leads this court to conclude that
neither the Missisquoi homeland or any part of it is Indian
country,'' the judge said. ``The thrust of the evidence is that the
Missiquoi community is thoroughly mixed if not blended into the
non-native American community.''
   Andrew Eschen, an assistant attorney general, said that while the
Abenakis had contested the state's criminal jurisdiction over the
tribe, Wolchik found the state does have jurisdiction.
   St. Francis said he would push, through the United Nations, for
total autonomy for the tribe.
   The Abenakis trace their tribe back to 9300 B.C. In recent
decades they have begun pushing to assert their right over land in
northern Vermont.
   The fight has split the tribe itself, with one faction favoring
more militant stands such as tribal courts, schools and law
enforcement. That faction, led by St. Francis, is in power today.
   The case originated in 1987, when Abenakis held a fish-in on the
banks of the Missisquoi River in Swanton. More than 30 people were
charged with fishing without a license or failure to display a
license.

<HEAD>South Korean Student, Priest Detained After Crossing Border</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities took into custody today a
South Korean student and a New York-educated Korean priest who
crossed the border from North Korea to dramatize national
unification efforts.
   Twenty-year-old Im Su-kyong, nicknamed ``The Flower of
Unification,'' held the hand of the Rev. Moon Gyu-hyon as they
crossed the border at Panmunjom, officials said.
   Ms. Im and Moon were taken into immediate custody and flown to
Seoul by police helicopter, where she was reportedly sneaked into
Seoul National University Hospital for a check-up and is expected
later today to be turned over to the national intelligence agency.
   The hospital would not confirm the report, but it was ringed by
riot police who blocked the entrance of reporters. The priest was
under arrest, officials said.
   Government officials said Ms. Im and the priest would be charged
with violating national security laws for making illegal trips to an
enemy country.
   The two were detained by South Korean officers assigned to the
U.N. Command as soon as they walked across the border at Panmunjom,
the truce village in the demilitarized zone separating the two
Koreas, officials said.
   The United Nations, a signatory to the 1953 Korean Armistice that
ended their bloody war, has jurisdiction over the southern half of
the truce village.
   Speaking to a rally of about 70 people in the northern sector of
Panmunjom, Ms. Im said her return across the border was intended to
promote the re-unification of the Korean peninsula, divided since
1945, the officials said.
   ``I hope my act will contribute to advance the unification of
South and North Korea,'' she was quoted as saying. ``Korea is one
forever and we must work to unify our fatherland.''
   North Korean news reports received in Tokyo said the South Korean
radical student was cheered by tens of thousands of people today
when she left the border town of Kaesong for the truce village.
   ``Taking into consideration the firm determination of Ms. Im to
return to South Korea with ardent desire for unification, our side
decided to open the door of our area at Panmunjom and will
thoroughly guarantee their safety,'' the North Korean reports said.
   In Seoul, about 1,000 people, including about a dozen foreigners,
marched in downtown Seoul shouting ``Drive out Yankees who block
unification'' and ``Safe passage for Miss Im _ the unification
flower!''
   South Korean officials said about 3,000 riot police were deployed
along the road leading to Panmunjom to block a possible attempt by
radical students and dissidents to march to the border.
   In a speech marking Korea's liberation from Japan, President Roh
Tae-woo asked that the communist North immediately resume all
channels of suspended dialogue.
   ``North Korea must realize that the only thing they can gain by
agitating the extremists and radicals within our society and by
enticing a few of them to secretly visit Pyongyang is the abhorrence
of our people,'' Roh said.
   Dialogue between the two Koreas has been sporadic but meetings
have been held the last year in an effort to improve relations. The
talks, however, bogged down after secret trips to the North by a
South Korean dissident clergyman, a lawmaker and the student, Ms. Im.

   A man found guilty of murder,
counterfeiting, and West Virginia's largest bank heist had been
convicted only once before this summer, but the courts decided he
was no stranger to crime.
   Judges on Monday bypassed a federal act under which John P. McCoy
could have been eligible for leniency and gave him the stiffest
sentence in the memory of prosecutors in southern West Virginia.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II sentenced McCoy to life in
prison plus 43 years on robbery, murder, jail escape and
murder-for-hire charges.
   ``Mr. McCoy is certainly one of the most, if not the most,
dangerous criminal in the district,'' U.S. Attorney Michael Carey
said. ``There are other people who have had the potential, but he's
the one who had it all come up in the same summer.''
   McCoy, 43, was convicted in June of staging West Virginia's
largest bank robbery and with killing a federal witness.
   In July, he and his girlfriend were found guilty in a
counterfeiting plot that made $800,000 in bad bills.
   This month, he and three others were convicted in a jail-escape
and murder-for-hire scheme.
   ``He told preposterous stories to three separate juries. He's a
pathological liar,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Bryant.
``There's no act that this man wouldn't do. This man should set no
foot in public for the rest of his life.''
   Federal Judge Robert Staker, who handled the counterfeiting
trial, imposed a nine-year sentence to run concurrent with Haden's
penalty. McCoy, of Slater's Branch, Ky., was fined a total of
$262,500.
   The McCoy case challenged the limits of the Sentencing Guidelines
Act of 1987, established to help trim jail populations and grant
leniency to newcomers to the world of crime.
   McCoy, with only a 1982 mail fraud conviction behind him, began
the summer eligible for leniency under the guidelines.
   The sentence imposed by Haden is the stiffest in memory in
southern West Virginia, Carey said. The district doesn't have
complete records on sentencings.
   McCoy maintained his innocence and claimed Bryant had a vendetta
against him because he used legal knowledge gained in prison to help
others.
   In addition to robbing the Matewan National Bank branch at
Kermit, McCoy was convicted of intimidating federal witnesses and of
killing Russell Davis, an accomplice in the robbery, in 1987.
   Co-conspirator Harold D. ``Boonie'' Runyon, 39, of Forest Hill,
Ky., pleaded guilty to the killing and testified for the government
against McCoy. Runyon was sentenced last month to life plus five
years.
   McCoy and his girlfriend, Debbie Farley, 36, used a color
photocopying maching to make what federal agents said were
relatively poor copies of U.S. and Canadian currency.
   McCoy and three others, including his 21-year-old son, Kennis,
were convicted two weeks ago of hiring a man to kill witnesses and
family members. No one was killed or injured. McCoy also was
convicted of concocting a jail-escape plot that failed.

   An alligator-like reptile took a stroll in
this Los Angeles neighborhood, giving neighbors a jolt before
authorities provided gator aid by roping it.
   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies got a report of a roaming
reptile on Monday and arrived to find a 3{-foot caiman, a type of
Central or South American crocodile similar to an alligator, Deputy
Chris Wahla said.
   ``The alligator was busily walking northbound on Clovis Avenue
approaching the intersection of 130th Street,'' he said.
   With rope supplied by a neighbor, deputies Allen Sarpy and
Richard Lucas lassoed the caiman, Wahla said.
   The deputies kept a tight rein on the crocodile for 20 minutes
until animal control officers showed up and took it to an animal
shelter. Wahla said he doubted the owner would step forward to claim
it.
   ``Animal control said the caiman variety was illegal to possess
in the United States,'' the deputy said.

   ``Parenthood'' pleasures and the deep-water
perils of ``The Abyss'' were box-office favorites this weekend,
heading a list that included loony comedies and die-hard
blockbusters.
   Universal's ``Parenthood,'' starring Steve Martin, took in $9.7
million in its second week of release, according to figures released
Monday by Exhibitor Relations Inc.
   ``The Abyss,'' with the lesser-known Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio, scored a hit with its hardware-heavy tale of close
encounters in the deep ocean. The big-budget film earned $9.3
million in its debut week. But the 2 hour and 20 minute running time
cost the movie one showing per day in many theaters, contributing to
an unimpressive per-screen average of $6,079.
   The return of sarcastic slasher Freddy Krueger brought ``A
Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child'' to third place in its
first weekend of release. ``Nightmare'' grossed $8.1 million,
followed by the Tom Hanks-drooling dog police comedy ``Turner and
Hooch'' in fourth with $6.3 million.
   The romantic comedy ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' with Billy
Crystal and Meg Ryan as best friends who become lovers, finished in
fifth with ticket sales of $6.2 million. ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' the
police adventure sequel with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, was next
with $6.1 million.
   Still going strong in seventh place was ``Batman,'' collecting $5
million. ``Batman'' has now sold $223 million worth of tickets. It
was trailed by the fading Sylvester Stallone prison movie ``Lock
Up,'' in eighth with $3.34 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were the family comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids'' with $3.33 million in ninth and the withering ``Young
Einstein'' with $2.1 million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Parenthood,'' Universal, $9.7 million, 1,300 screens, $7,440
per screen, $30.3 million, two weeks.
   2. ``The Abyss,'' 20th Century Fox, $9.3 million, 1,533 screens,
$6,079 per screen, $13 million, one week.
   3. ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,'' New Line,
$8.1 million, 1,902 screens, $4,266 per screen, $8.1 million, one
week.
   4. ``Turner and Hooch,'' Disney, $6.3 million, 1,880 screens,
$3,357 per screen, $38.9 million, three weeks.
   5. ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' Columbia, $6.2 million, 1,171

<HEAD>Pravda Blasts Baltics for `Nationalist Hysteria'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Communist Party daily Pravda today
blasted extremists and growing ``nationalist hysteria'' in the
Baltic region for labor unrest that is now its seventh day in
Estonia.
   ``Openly anti-Soviet groups have become activized'' in the three
Baltic republics and ``a situation is building up of nationalist
hysteria,'' the newspaper said in an unsigned commentary.
   In two other Soviet areas threatened by labor unrest, the
Caucasus republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan, officials said today
that all was quiet.
   Estonia's Communist Party chief called Monday for Russian workers
in his tiny republic to end the strike and negotiate differences.
   But in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, strike committee member
Mikhail Lysenko said today that thousands of Russian workers at
about 50 factories stayed off the job to protest a new law that
tightens residency requirements for voters and candidates.
   Pravda aimed its criticism at the law rather than the strikers,
saying ``the passage of discriminatory acts has an extremely
destabilizing influence on the political situation.''
   Pravda's comments reflected Moscow's unease with the grassroots
nationalist movements that have swept the Baltic republics of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
   The movements, known as People's Fronts, have moved from focusing
on support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms to ``narrow
nationalist positions,'' Pravda said.
   It complained that the fronts had taken to attacking the
Communist Party for neglecting the interests of non-Russian
populations, and that ``certain forces'' were pushing for complete
secession from the Soviet Union.
   Pravda also criticized the Baltic movements for sending
emissaries around the country to spread their ideas, and ``using
foreign ties more and more often for the same destructive goals.''
   It proposed political dialogue as the only means of defusing the
situation.
   Estonian party chief Vaino Vyalyas said Monday that dialogue had
not succeeded in resolving the strike, but that he was not ready to
give up.
   ``We met with strike committee representatives and they later
said they were not satisfied with the results. If so, let's continue
the talks,'' Vyalyas said in an Estonian television interview.
   State-run Moscow Radio said the Estonian law will take the right
to vote away from more than 100,000 non-Estonians in the republic of
1.6 million people.
   The new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the same
district for two years, or anywhere in Estonia for five years.
Candidates must live in the same place for five years, or in Estonia
for 10 years.
   Vyalyas admitted the rights of Estonia's minorities _ whom he did
not identify but presumably including Russians _ had not been taken
into account. ``This is our mistake and it must be corrected,'' he
said.
   Estonians say residence requirements for voters and candidates
are legitimate measures used around the world.
   But one strike leader said if Americans had a similar law, they
would have to wait five years to be able to vote after moving from
one state to another.
   The strike has already cost millions of dollars, Moscow Radio
said.
   The striking Russians, most of whom work in heavy industrial
plants, also object to a new national decision to give Estonia free
rein over its economy. The workers are demanding that factories with
a predominantly Russian-speaking labor force remain the property of
the national government rather than be handed over to Estonia.

   Summer showers and thunderstorms drenched much of the nation
early today.
   An upper air disturbance over the central Rockies produced
showers and thunderstorms over eastern Colorado and southeast
Wyoming. A thunderstorm at Longmont, Colo., produced wind gusts up
to 50 mph.
   An upper air low pressure system combined with unstable air over
the northern Rockies triggered thunderstorms over western Montana
and the Idaho panhandle. Thunderstorm winds gusted to 66 mph at
Lewiston, Mont., Monday night.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over southern
New England, and thunderstorms with heavy rains developed in humid,
unstable air over Georgia and Alabama. More than 2 inches of rain

   A Navy petty officer has filed suit to
collect the $100,000 life insurance benefit of a shipmate who died
as a result of the April 19 gun-turret blast aboard the USS Iowa.
   The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Miami seeks
payment of a $50,000 double-indemnity policy to Kendall Truitt from
Amex Life Assurance Co. of San Rafael, Calif., according to Ellis
Rubin of Miami, Truitt's attorney.
   Truitt, now stationed at Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville,
is the sole beneficiary of the policy held by his fellow gunners
mate, Clayton Hartwig, one of 47 sailors killed in the Iowa
explosion.
   The life insurance company has refused to pay the claim on
Hartwig's death until the Navy completes its investigation into the
accident, Rubin said.
   ``They are waiting for the Navy's report and they said the Navy
is indicating they have circumstantial evidence that it might have
been a suicide,'' Rubin said.
   Amex, a division of American Express, would not comment on the
lawsuit.
   Amex had two months to pay the benefit from the filing of the
loss, which occurred June 12, Rubin said.
   ``I think they will settle with us as soon as the Navy report
does not reach the conclusion there was a suicide, and it won't,''
Rubin said.
   ``We are very upset that the Navy report is taking so long to
come out. Either the Navy is planning a whitewash or a coverup, I
don't know which of the two. That's why it is taking so long,''
Rubin said.
   News reports after the explosion indicated that investigators,
suspicious of the life insurance policy, at one point were focusing
on Truitt. But Rubin said in June that Naval Investigative Service
agents had apologized to his client for news leaks suggesting that
Truitt was involved in the explosion.
   Last month, NBC News reported that the Navy had determined that
the explosion aboard the Iowa was the result of sabotage by a
suicidal sailor.
   NBC said the Navy investigation reached that decision after
ruling out mechanical malfunctions, accidental detonation,
electrical flaws and all other technical causes for the explosion.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said July 19 that the conclusion of
suicide ``was not based on official reports of the Navy.''

   Constitutional scholars urged Congress to
reject a proposed amendment outlawing desecration of the American
flag, but a U.S. senator said there was political pressure to agree
to the measure.
   The 200-year-old former home of the Supreme Court was the setting
Monday for the Senate Judiciary Committee's second hearing on what
action, if any, should be taken in response to the Supreme Court's
June decision that flag burning represents protected political
speech.
   The Bush administration and leading Republicans in Congress
support a constitutional amendment that would permit states to
outlaw destruction of the flag.
   But a Philadelphia-based federal judge and two constitutional
historians asked the committee Monday to show restraint.
   Flag burning, while carrying powerful emotional weight, is not a
serious enough offense to merit the curtailment of free-speech
protections, said federal Judge Louis Pollak, the former dean of the
University of Pennsylvania law school.
   ``I urge you not to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bill
of Rights, not to celebrate that anniversary by submitting a
proposed amendment which would dilute protections of the First
Amendment,'' Pollak said.
   The session was considered an official judiciary panel hearing,
even though Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Chairman Joseph Biden,
D-Del., were the only members present. The hearing was held at the
200-year-old former city hall, which housed the U.S. Supreme Court
from 1791 until 1800.
   Fifty-three senators have agreed to sponsor a constitutional
amendment, Specter said, noting that ``there is a considerable
political downside'' to not going along, since so many Americans
were outraged by the high court ruling.
   ``I confess to being one of those who was indignant (at the court
decision),'' Specter said. Still, Specter said he would prefer that
Congress simply pass a bill outlawing flag desecration; Biden agreed
   Proponents of the amendment argue that such a sweeping statement
is needed because a bill might not pass constitutional muster with
the high court. An amendment would require a two-thirds majority
vote in the House and Senate, and ratification by three-quarters of
the states.
   ``I would like to see the Congress of the United States take the
third option of doing nothing,'' Pollak said. ``Doing nothing may be
the hardest of the options,'' the judge said.
   Specter replied: ``I disagree with you, Judge Pollak, that doing
nothing may be the hardest thing to do. We are experts at that.''
   Law professor Stanley Kutler of the University of Wisconsin and
history professor Michael Parrish of the University of
California-San Diego urged Congress not to overreact.
   Kutler compared the flag issue to prohibition, which came about
with the 18th Amendment and was later repealed. In both cases, he
said, ``emotion ruled.''

   An incoming call to a mobile phone in
luggage aboard a commuter plane apparently triggered a smoke alarm,
forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing, a federal official
said.
   The Express Airlines I plane carrying seven passengers and two
crew members landed without incident Monday and no one was injured,
said Bob Spencer, a Federal Aviation Administration supervisor at
Port Columbus International Airport.
   The Columbus-to-Milwaukee flight was about three miles outside
Columbus when a detector light was activated, indicating smoke in
the baggage area, Spencer said.
   The pilot of the twin-engine, turbo-prop plane radioed the
airport about 5:30 p.m. and emergency vehicles were called out to
the runway, he said.
   After the plane landed, the crew discovered a cellular telephone
in a passenger's suitcase, and determined a call had caused the
problem, Spencer said.
   The flight continued to Milwaukee after the telephone was shut
off, Spencer said.
   Express Airlines I, based in Memphis, Tenn., operates the plane
under a marketing agreement with Northwest Airlines.

<TEXT>
   Frederik W. de Klerk has
stirred both hope and doubt about his ability to lead South Africa
toward a peaceful solution of its racial conflicts.
   The 53-year-old education minister, who was sworn in today in
Pretoria as acting president, is known as an affable pragmatist who
seeks to avoid ideological labels.
   He became leader of the governing National Party in February,
narrowly defeating a Cabinet colleague in a parliamentary party
caucus.
   ``Our goal is a new South Africa, a totally changed South Africa,
'' he told Parliament at the time. ``White domination, insofar as it
still exists, must go.''
   Later, de Klerk said: ``White security can never be built on
injustice toward others. Things will have to change drastically and
quickly.''
   After several years of black protests and increasing world
sanctions against South Africa during P.W. Botha's rule, many whites
saw de Klerk as representing a new and more conciliatory generation
of National Party leaders.
   They welcomed the vision of a nation in which, as he put it,
``all reasonable people align themselves behind mutually acceptable
goals.''
   Helen Suzman, who pioneered anti-apartheid views among Parliament
members, said of de Klerk: ``People are being too optimistic if they
think he is going to throw fundamental policy overboard, but I think
he's pragmatic and intelligent. He realizes that change is
absolutely inevitable.''
   Black leaders said they suspect de Klerk will pursue largely
cosmetic changes. Their suspicions were strengthened by his refusal
to accept a one-man, one-vote system that would give power to the
black majority, and by the National Party's platform for general
elections Sept. 6.
   The platform supports the idea of group social and political
rights, which has helped preserve segregated neighborhoods and
schools under the apartheid system of racial separation.
   De Klerk practiced law before entering Parliament in 1973. He
held several Cabinet posts beginning in 1978 and in 1982 took the
powerful job of National Party leader in the Transvaal, South
Africa's most populous and wealthiest province.
   He is married, with three children and his wife, Marike, once
described him as ``a charmer, with many broken hearts left after
him.''
   F.W., as he likes to be called, comes from a long line of
politicians beginning with his great-grandfather, a senator. His
brother Willem quit as editor of Rapport, the largest
Afrikaans-language newspaper, after being criticized for
increasingly liberal views on race reform.
   The brothers have differed over politics, but have said they
never let those differences affect their close family relationship.
   South African analysts picture de Klerk as a centrist, careful
not to alienate either conservatives or liberals in the National
Party.
   If, as expected, the party wins the Sept. 6 elections, de Klerk
will become president with the same task as Botha: To meet black
demands for civil rights and still reassure the minority whites
their way of life will not be destroyed.
   Tom Sebina of the banned African National Congress guerrilla
movement, said recently de Klerk and Botha ``are pieces of the same
carcass. If the meat is bad, the meat is bad.''

<HEAD>Marine With AIDS Suing Navy for Medical Malpractice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Marine has filed a $55 million suit against the
U.S. Navy charging that malpractice forced his wife to have a blood
transfusion that left her infected with AIDS, which she passed on to
him and their son.
   Martin Gaffney, 40, a chief warrant officer at the South Weymouth
Naval Air Station, contends that Navy doctors mishandled his wife's
pregnancy in 1981, resulting in a stillbirth and the need for a
transfusion.
   At the time, little was known about AIDS, and donated blood was
not routinely screened for the virus. But Gaffney's suit, which is
scheduled to go to trial Aug. 21 in federal court, says the
transfusion would not have been needed had doctors properly treated
his wife, Mutsuko.
   Mrs. Gaffney died of AIDS in 1987, shortly after the lawsuit was
filed. The Gaffneys' son, Johnny, was born with AIDS and died in
1986 at the age of 13 months.
   The only member of the family to be spared infection was their
6-year-old daughter, Maureene. Gaffney himself has tested positive
for the virus, although he has not yet shown any symptoms.
   Marianne Bowler, an assistant U.S. attorney who is representing
the Navy, declined to comment on the case.
   Gaffney's attorney, Jaclyn McKenney, said Navy investigators
traced one of the units of blood that Mutsuko Gaffney received to a
discharged Marine.
   A deposition from the blood donor, identified as ``John Doe'' in
court records, shows he has refused to be tested for AIDS because he
fears the result might prevent him from getting jobs and health
insurance.
   Mrs. Gaffney was under the care of doctors at Long Beach Naval
Hospital in California when she delivered the stillborn baby four
weeks overdue. The doctors had declined to induce labor earlier or
to perform a caesarian section to deliver the baby, the lawsuit says.

   Israeli warplanes buzzed Palestinian
refugee camps near this southern port today, drawing heavy
anti-aircraft fire from guerrillas, police reported.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio in Beirut earlier reported
the Israeli fighter-bombers hit targets near Sidon, 25 miles south
of Beirut.
   But a police spokesman in Sidon, who cannot be named under
standing regulations, said the Israeli jets ``did not attack.''
   The spokesman said two Israeli jet fighters flew at ``a very low
altitude'' over the Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh camps on the city's
eastern edge at 12:15 p.m. (4:15 a.m. EDT).
   Guerrillas in the sprawling shantytowns opened up on the jets
with twin-barrelled anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed
when the jets made a single pass over the camps.
   Witnesses in Sidon said the Israeli action triggered panic in the
city. Several motorists jumped from their vehicles and took cover in
bomb shelters, entrances to buildings and fields.
   The Israeli air force has carried out nine raids this year
against targets in Lebanon, including Sidon's refugee camps. Eight
people have been killed and 67 wounded in the air strikes.

   Environmental activists from Massachusetts to
California took to the treetops to voice their opposition to logging
in the country's remaining virgin timberlands.
   Protesters set up camps in trees to coincide with the first of
four hearings by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on its proposal
to list the northern spotted owl as a threatened species.
   Environmentalists say the owl requires old-growth forests for its
habitat; the forest-products industry says many logging and mill
jobs would be lost if the owl is protected by setting aside forest
in protected zones.
   ``This is obviously spotted owl week throughout the Northwest,''
said Darryl Cherney, an Earth First! spokesman involved in the
protests near Ukiah, Calif. ``The timber crisis is culminating to
such an extent right now, that now's the time'' for action.
   Earth First!, known for putting spikes in trees to discourage
logging, said its ``aerial occupations'' had protesters sitting on
3-by-6-foot platforms suspended in trees. They were equipped with
food, water and other gear, and supported by ground crews, Cherney
said.
   The protests began Sunday or Monday in Washington, Oregon,
California, Colorado, New Mexico and Massachusetts, Cherney said.
Others were planned in British Columbia, Georgia and Montana. Some
protesters said they were prepared to stay in the trees for weeks.
   Jay Ward, 31, lodged himself 50 feet high in an evergreen outside
U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield's office in Portland, Ore. He said he had
enough food and water to last at least four days.
   Portland was the site Monday of the first hearing, at which a top
official in the U.S. Forest Service said the spotted owl can survive
without being listed as a threatened species under federal wildlife
protection law.
   Hal Salwasser, deputy director for wildlife and fisheries, said
his agency is managing timberlands with the aim of ensuring the
owl's long-term survival.
   Although the hearings were supposed to center on the biological
concerns of the owl, many loggers testified about the economic
consequences they feared if logging is restricted. Federal judges
already have halted timber sales in the region because of lawsuits
filed by environmentalists.
   ``To tell you the truth, I'm scared to death,'' said Scott Hall
as he held his 3-year-old son, Adam, in his arms. Hall, a
superintendent for High Cascade Lumber in Skamania County, Wash.,
said his mill is expected to run out of logs _ and jobs _ in
November.
   Cherney said the demonstrations were not just about the spotted
owl, but included concerns over forest resources in general.
   ``If someone's sitting in a second-growth tree our message is:
Let some of these second-growth forests become old-growth forests,''
he said.
   In Washington's Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, three
demonstrators climbed trees in the Goodman Ridge timber sale in an
attempt to stop logging, said Janine Blaeloch, an Earth First!
spokeswoman in Seattle.
   Gary Cordova, a Forest Service spokesman in Portland, said he
knew of no agency policy for dealing with such protests and that
decisions were made at the scene.
   ``We don't want to violate anyone's constitutional rights to free
expression, but we also want to guarantee ... that logging
operations are able to continue,'' he said.

   Democrats in the district Claude Pepper represented
for 27 years hoped to emerge from today's primary runoff with a
candidate strong enough to defend the U.S. House seat against a
formidable Republican opponent.
   Dade County Elections Supervisor David Leahy predicted about 15
percent of the 18th District's 100,198 registered Democrats would
vote in the special runoff election pitting former city commissioner
Rosario Kennedy and attorney Gerald Richman.
   Richman defeated Ms. Kennedy by 146 votes in the Aug. 1 primary,
winning 28 percent to her 27 percent of the vote in a field of seven
Democrats.
   State Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen took 83 percent of the vote in the
GOP primary and will face the winner of today's vote Aug. 29.
Republicans are confident they can add to their 10-8 edge in the
Florida congressional delegation by taking over Pepper's seat.
   President Bush was to campaign with Ms. Ros-Lehtinen on
Wednesday, and Vice President Dan Quayle paid a political visit two
weeks ago.
   Ms. Kennedy, 44, and Richman, 48, campaigned Monday in Miami
Beach retirement areas after concentrating campaigning Sunday in
predominantly black areas that may hold the swing vote Tuesday. Ms.
Kennedy carried predominantly Hispanic precincts Aug. 1 and Richman
dominated Miami Beach's Jewish and retiree vote.
   Pepper died May 30 at age 88.

   A spokesman said Christopher E. Jackson, 33, may be considered

   The duck was the mate of a drake that spent time flying between
Lafayette Park opposite the White House and a nearby fountain.
   Eyewitnesses told The Washington Times that Jackson identified
himself as ``Chris from New Hampshire,'' picked up the duck Monday
and crossed Pennsylvania Avenue to the northern gate of the White
House.
   He then pulled a knife from his pocket and slit the fowl's throat
before impaling its remains on the White House fence, according to
the Secret Service.
   Four Secret Service agents then handcuffed Jackson and took him
into custody after disarming him.
   The White House had no comment on the incident.
   The FBI was called in to investigate because the bureau has
jurisdiction over migratory birds.

<TEXT>
   National Party leader F.W. de Klerk
was sworn in today as South Africa's acting president, a day after
he and other Cabinet members forced the resignation of P.W. Botha.
   In a news conference immediately after taking the oath of office,
de Klerk praised the ousted Botha, who was in power for 11
tumultuous years, as one of South Africa's greatest leaders.
   ``His greatest gift to South Africa is the fact that he has put
our country on the road to fundamental reform, that he has
successfully started pulling South Africa out of its dead-end
streets and that he guided us in the direction of a totally new
dispensation,'' de Klerk said.
   Shortly after being sworn in at the Union Buildings by Chief
Justice Michael Corbett, de Klerk said he planned to convene a new
Parliament on Sept. 13, a week after national elections. He is
expected to be chosen by an electoral congress the next day to serve
a full five-year term as president.
   Botha had attacked de Klerk personally in what was seen as a
bitter and undignified farewell speech broadcast on national
television Monday night. Specifically, Botha said he opposed de
Klerk's plans to make an important diplomatic trip to Zambia later
this month.
   De Klerk defended himself in a television interview immediately
following Botha's speech, and said the 73-year-old president's
departure ``was in the best interest of South Africa.''
   Botha, with his party's support, initiated South Africa's first
halting steps of race reform in the late 1970's and early 1980's,
though his efforts slowed considerably after nationwide black unrest
erupted in 1984.
   After his swearing-in, de Klerk said of Botha, ``His place in
history among the great leaders that our country produced is already
assured.''
   ``There is no doubt that we stand on the threshold of a new era
in South Africa and southern Africa,'' the 53-year-old de Klerk
said. ``History offers us a unique opportunity for peaceful
solutions.''
   ``I trust that the people of South Africa will show the courage
and vision required to break the cycle of conflict, tension and
isolation that has gripped us for so long,'' he said. ``We want to
build a new South Africa in which all people participate in
decisions affecting their lieves at all levels.''
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading critic of the
National Party, said of de Klerk: ``All he is doing is giving a new
face to apartheid.'' Tutu said the transition is ``just a change of
initials from P.W. to F.W.''
   But Tutu said from his Cape Town office that he felt sorry for
Botha.
   ``He looked a pathetic figure. Here we saw a coup. They didn't
use guns, but they certainly put pistols to his head.''
   In general, de Klerk and the other Cabinet ministers were more
sympathetic to Botha than the public and news media today.
   The banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, said the leadership change will make
little difference to South Africa's 28 million blacks.
   The Cabinet members told Botha, who suffered a stroke Jan. 18, to
use his health as an excuse for resigning 23 days before the crucial
polls.
   But the defiant Botha said his health was not the issue.
   ``I am not prepared to leave on a lie,'' Botha said he told the
Cabinet.
   Botha showed no emotion or signs of ill health when reading his
20-minute resignation statement from a desk at his official
residence in Cape Town.
   ``After all these years of my best efforts for the National
Party, and for the government of this country as well as the
security of our country, I am being ignored by ministers serving in
my Cabinet,'' Botha said.
   Botha, nicknamed the ``Great Crocodile'' for his feared temper
and sometimes ruthless manner, seldom appeared in public following
his stroke.
   Botha insisted he was not a ``sulky old man,'' but he never
offered congratulations to de Klerk, who replaced Botha as party
leader in February.
   Botha's behavior became increasingly erratic in recent weeks.
Last month he refused to attend a farewell banquet planned by the
National Party to honor him.
   He did, however, appear unannounced at a provincial party
congress, forcing de Klerk to give up his seat at the head table.
   De Klerk, a lawyer who appears to share Botha's vision of limited
and gradual race reform, has spoken in vague terms of dismantling
more apartheid laws.
   However, he has not promised any specific changes on major
apartheid issues such as power-sharing with the black majority or
desegregating schools and neighborhoods.
   ``De Klerk was party to the disastrous policies of the government
under P.W. Botha's rule,'' the United Democratic Front said in a
statement. ``The mass democratic movement demands the government as
a whole resigns so that democracy and peace may be established once
and for all.''
   P.W. Botha, who met with four black African leaders last year,
worked hard to increase South African contact with the rest of the
continent. But he had said it was ``inopportune to meet with
President Kaunda at this stage,'' because the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement is based in Zambia and is
planning to disrupt the September elections.
   The National Party, which has ruled South Africa for 41 years, is
expected to lose ground to both the anti-apartheid Democratic Party
on its left and the hard-line segregationist Conservative Party on
its right.

   A man arrested in connection with the kidnapping and
slaying of a 5-year-old girl has confessed to killing two other
girls in a series of cases that have brought fear to Tokyo suburbs,
police said today.
   In a society remarkably free of crime, the brutality of the
murders in an area northwest of Tokyo has shocked many Japanese and
dominated news and television reports.
   The cases, however, also have drawn attention to the many
animated films available in Japan that show violence and scenes of
undressed girls and comic books involving crime. The suspect,
Tsutomu Miyazaki, said he collected them.
   Miyazaki, the 26-year-old son of a printing shop owner, was
arrested Friday in the kidnapping and killing of 5-year-old Ayako
Nomoto two months ago. On Sunday, police said he confessed to
killing two 4-year-old girls, Mari Konno and Erika Namba.
   Police said they also were questioning Miyazaki about whether he
was involved in the disappearance of a fourth girl, 7-year-old
Masami Yoshizawa, missing since October.
   Miyazaki was first arrested July 23 for allegedly forcing a
6-year-old girl to let him take nude pictures of her. During
questioning, he admitted to having killed Ayako and directed police
to a wooded area where her skull was found, police said.
   Police said Miyazaki told them he had picked up Ayako in his car
but became angry when she ``made fun of a deformity'' in his hands
and strangled her. He then took her body to his room, where he
chopped off her head, hands and feet, they said. Her torso was found
northwest of Tokyo on June 11.
   ``I cannot control myself when I see a young girl,'' newspapers
quoted him as telling police.
   Since Miyazaki confessed last week to murdering Ayako, an army of
reporters has been stationed at his house, police headquarters, the
victims' houses and murder sites.
   When questioned, teachers told reporters Miyazaki seldom stood
out and left little impression on them. Acquaintances described
Miyazaki as a quiet loner who bragged about his collection of nearly
4,500 videotapes, including many animated films.
   One of Miyazaki's videotapes, ``Chiniku no Hana'' (Flower of
Blood and Flesh), has a plot that resembles Ayako's murder,
investigators said. In it, a man follows a girl in his car, kidnaps
her and then dismembers her in his apartment.
   Police quoted Miyazaki as saying he picked up Mari in his car and
``drove her to a mountain, where I strangled her to death. I took
two pictures of her in the car. I burned her with other things in
the front yard at my house. I put her bones and ashes in a box and
put it at the front door of Mari's home.''
   In February, when the box was found, letters were sent to Mari's
family and to the newspaper Asahi Shimbun signed with the female
name ``Yuko Imada.'' In the letters, the writer claimed to have
killed Mari out of frustration from being unable to bear a child.
   Investigators said Monday they had discovered that ``Yuko Imada''
was the name of a female detective in a 1988 comic book who solved a
case involving a poisoned salami in a supermarket. Police said they
believe Miyazaki wrote the letters because of his interest in comics
and animated films.
   Police said Miyazaki told them he had kidnapped Erika, strangled
her in his car, stripped off her clothes and left her in a forest.
   Mitsuyoshi Maniwa, a psychology professor at Shizuoka University,
said Miyazaki was unable to distinguish between reality and fiction
because of his overwhelming interest in horror and animation videos.
   ``Through images and advertising, comic books, magazines and
videotapes, men are taught to look at women as objects,'' said Chie
Kanematsu, editor of a newsletter published by Kodo Suru Onnatachi,
a group fighting exploitative images of women. ``This is the
environment Japanese children grow up in.''
   Under Japanese law, prosecutors have up to 20 days to release him
or bring charges.

   A suspect was charged with murder and
kidnapping for allegedly beating a man in his home, abducting his
wife and two small children and leaving the children near the
women's body in a wooded area, police said.
   Byron Raynes, 21, was charged after turning himself in to police
in Greenville, 110 miles north of Augusta. He was flown to Augusta
late Monday and was being held in the Kennebec County Jail awaiting
District Court arraignment today or Wednesday, state police
spokesman Randy Nichols said.
   Authorities said family members identified the dead woman as Peg
Shaw, 35.
   The state medical examiner's office scheduled an autopsy for
Monday night, but the findings were not immediately available,
Nichols said.
   Nichols identified her husband as John Shaw, who is employed at
the Augusta Mental Health Institute. The couple's children _ son,
Sam, 3, and daughter, Julia, 1 _ were reunited with their father,
police said.
   Police declined to say if Raynes knew the family or if any motive
for the crime had been established.
   Before he turned himself in, police had put out an all-points
bulletin for Raynes. Nichols refused to say whether there was any
evidence in the Shaw's home in the Augusta suburb of Gardiner
linking Raynes to the assault.
   Raynes has longstanding family ties in Gardiner, where he was
living with his parents, Nichols said. He was employed by an
electrical contractor in the Augusta area, he said.
   At about 6:30 a.m. Monday, an assailant entered the Shaw's home,
striking John Shaw in the head with a wooden mallet and handcuffing
him in the basement, Nichols said.
   About an hour later, neighbors heard Shaw screaming for help, he
said. Police were called and as they were questioning Shaw, the
family's van drove past the house, he said.
   ``We feel at that point that the suspect was alone,'' Nichols
said.
   Police soon found the van abandoned at some railroad tracks in
Gardiner, Nichols said.
   Early in the afternoon, a state police trooper noticed some
tracks coming from a muddy road in South Gardiner. Nearby, the
trooper found the woman's body and her two children huddled together
nearby.
   During the day, police used an airplane and boats on the Kennebec
River in their search for the suspect, Nichols said.
   Authorities also had set up roadblocks on U.S. 201 in the area,
Gardiner Deputy Police Chief Craig Marshall said.

<BYLINE>Bitterness May Be Natural Poison Alarm, Taste Expert Says ^By MALCOLM
RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ability to taste bitterness may be a
natural defense against poisoning, says a prominent taste researcher.
   For one thing, bitterness and toxicity tend to appear together
strikingly often, although there are exceptions, said Linda
Bartoshuk of Yale University.
   For another, scientists have found that the tongue contains more
than one kind of sensor to detect bitterness, she said. That would
make sense if the system were set up to detect multiple types of
poisons, she said.
   Bartoshuk discussed research in taste Monday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association.
   Bitterness and sweetness are detected when substances bind to
specialized proteins, while saltiness and sourness are sensed in a
different way, she said.
   She demonstrated the multiple types of bitterness detectors by
having audience members taste postage-stamp-sized squares of paper
impregnated with a substance called 6-n-propylthiouracil. About half
the audience tasted it as bitter. The other half sensed no taste at
all.
   Yet everybody in the audience could have tasted the bitterness of
quinine, Bartoshuk said. So the two kinds of bitterness are picked
up by different sensing proteins, she said.
   The ability to taste the chemical on the paper is determined
genetically, she said. About two-thirds of the general population
are ``tasters'' on this test, she said.
   Tasters find Swiss cheese more bitter than non-tasters do, she
said. They also perceive sugar placed on the front of the tongue to
be twice as sweet as non-tasters do, she said.
   Non-tasters find caffeine less bitter, and so are not likely to
notice the difference between regular and decaffeinated coffee, she
said.
   Just what difference the responsible genes make in the taste buds
is not clear, but perhaps tasters have some bitterness-sensing
proteins that non-tasters lack, she said.

   Rep. Larkin Smith went to Washington with a
hard-line stance against crime gained in 22 years of law
enforcement, and in his short House tenure he impressed colleagues
with his knowledge of the law.
   The bodies of the freshman Republican congressman and his pilot
were found Monday in the wreckage of a single-engine plane that
crashed Sunday night in a densely-wooded area of the DeSoto National
Forest in south Mississippi.
   The gray-haired ex-sheriff won a seat on the House Judiciary
Committee because of his law enforcement experience, despite a
Republican tradition of appointing only lawyers to the panel.
   ``Because of his background and hard-working manner he gave every
indication of becoming a star,'' said Alan Coffey, chief Republican
counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.
   Gov. Ray Mabus ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff,
saying Smith ``had dedicated his life to public service.'' A date
has not been set for a special election to fill his seat.
   President Bush expressed regret in a statement read by White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``Congressman Smith was just
beginning a promising career in the Congress,'' it said.
   Searchers had to bulldoze their way to the thickly wooded crash
site after rescuers spotted the wreckage of the single-engine Cessna
177 from the air.
   Smith, 45, and his pilot, 58-year-old Chuck Vierling of Gulfport,
had left Hattiesburg Sunday evening for a 90-mile flight to
Gulfport. Smith had thrown out the first baseball at the Dixie Youth
World Series.
   The plane's engine appeared to have been dead when it crashed,
said Dr. Michael West, deputy medical examiner for neighboring
Forrest County. West said there was no sign of fire or smell of
gasoline at the crash site.
   Smith was the second congressman in as many weeks to die in a
plane crash. Earlier Sunday, the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep.
Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and 15 other people had been found in
Ethiopa with no survivors. The plane disappeared Aug. 7 on a flight
to a remote village.
   ``He had emerged as one of the real leaders in the freshman class
of the 101st Congress,'' said Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery,
D-Miss., who had joined Smith at the youth baseball series.
   ``Our last conversation at the series was talking about the loss
of Congressman Leland, and I told Larkin that he should be careful
in traveling and performing his duties.''
   Smith had co-sponsored legislation to strengthen federal drug law
enforcement, and criticized drug czar William Bennett for backing an
import ban on semi-automatic assault weapons.
   He once took fellow Judiciary Committee members to an FBI
shooting range to demonstrate his belief that shotguns were just as
dangerous as assault weapons. He claimed 90 percent of crimes were
committed with pistols and shotguns.
   A death penalty advocate, he supported making capital punishment
laws uniform across the country. ``It may not deter crime, but that
person who committed that heinous crime won't be out there,'' he
said.
   He also advocated eliminating paroles and early release for
dangerous criminals, and streamlining the federal appeals process,
which he called ``never-ending.''
   Smith sat on the House-Senate conference committee that drafted
the final savings and loan bailout legislation, a rare assignment
for a freshman.
   A native of the small south Mississippi town of Poplarville,
Smith's law enforcement career began in 1966 when he joined the
Pearl River County Sheriff's Department. In 1977, he was appointed
chief of police in Gulfport.
   Running as a reform candidate in 1983, Smith defeated incumbent
Leroy Hobbs to take over the scandal-ridden Harrison County
Sheriff's Department. Hobbs later was convicted of racketeering and
drug charges.
   Last November, he narrowly defeated state Sen. Gene Taylor for
the seat held by fellow Republican Trent Lott, who ran successfully
for the Senate.
   Survivors include his wife, Sheila, a daughter, Tracy, and
grandson.
   A memorial will be held Wednesday and Thursday in Biloxi. A
funeral Mass will be held Thursday, followed by the burial in
Gulfport.

   Soldiers drove public buses to get
workers to offices today at the start of a daylong strike called by
Sinhalese radicals protesting the continuing deployment of Indian
troops in Sri Lanka.
   Shops in Colombo were closed and hundreds of employees began
returning home because most offices and businesses were not
functioning. Soliders in camouflage uniforms patrolled the city and
policemen were posted at major intersections and near bus stops.
   At least seven people were killed by Sinhalese radicals today and
Monday, according to military officials. The officials, who cannot
be identified under briefing rules, said the victims included two
soldiers ambushed early today in the central town of Nuwara Eliya.
   The other killings were in the Sinhalese-dominated south, they
said.
   The strike coincides with the 42nd anniversary of India's
independence from Britain. At least two Colombo-based newspapers
refused to carry special supplements to mark the occasion, sources
in the dailies said on condition of anonymity.
   The call for the strike came in posters signed by the National
Worker's Federation, which the government describes as a radical
group.
   The posters in the Sinhalese language denounced the presence of
an estimated 43,000 Indian soldiers, deployed in the northeast to
oversee a 1987 peace accord aimed at ending a Tamil insurrection for
an independent nation.
   The ultra-nationalist front says the Indian troops compromise the
country's sovereignty. It also says the government has made too many
concessions to the Tamil militants, who began their separatist
campaign in 1983.
   The Tamils argue they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese,
who comprise 75 percent of the population. Tamils are 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa on June 1 asked India to withdraw
its soldiers, but so far India has pulled out only 2,200 troops and
the results have failed to appease the extremists.
   India has said a quick withdrawal of troops could lead to more
violence but that it will withdraw soldiers in phases, pulling them
all out by February.
   Sinhalese extremists have killed at least 4,000 people over the
past two years, according to the government. About 11,000 other
people have died in the 6-year-old Tamil revolt.

   Authorities have executed a policewoman in Canton
for taking tens of thousands of dollars in bribes, official reports
said today.
   Major state newspapers and television reports said the
policewoman, Zhang Mayun, took bribes worth $56,150 in exchange for
allowing people to remain in the southern city illegally.
   She was sentenced to death on June 19, but the reports did not
say exactly when she was executed. Death sentences in China are
usually carried out within a day or two with a bullet to the back of
the head.
   In another report, the English-language China Daily said
authorities had received 172,000 tips from informants at corruption
reporting centers from January to June. The centers are part of a
major government anti-corruption drive.
   The reports mentioned three pending cases of officials also
accused of taking bribes.
   About 22,000 officials were accused of wrongdoing by the
informants.

<TEXT>
   The brother-in-law of former Mexican President
Luis Echeverria was held without bail today as a witness in the 1985
torture-murder of a U.S. drug agent.
   Ruben Zuno-Arce was flown from Texas to Los Angeles on Monday and
ordered held pending a hearing next Monday.
   Investigators believe he has information about the slaying of
Enrique Camarena, according to papers filed by the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Camarena and his pilot were kidnapped and slain after the DEA
agent led a series of damaging raids on marijuana plantations
allegedly run by reputed Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro-Quintero.
   Zuno-Arce, whose sister is the wife of Echeverria, Mexico's
president from 1970 to 1976, was arrested Wednesday night in San
Antonio by U.S. immigration agents as he tried to cross into Mexico.
An inspector recognized Zuno-Arce as one of those on a list of
suspected drug traffickers, authorities said.
   Jeremiah Handy, Zuno-Arce's lawyer, said he knows the Mascota,
Mexico, resident as a successful dealer in lumber and vegetables,
with no history of drug trafficking.
   Zuno-Arce does not know Caro-Quintero ``except as a name in the
paper like anyone else,'' Handy said. He called the unusual no-bail
order ``a government tactic to in fact hammer on him, put him in
jail and cause grief to his family.''
   Camarena's slaying strained U.S.-Mexican relations, and the DEA
has vowed to bring in every person involved in the murders. Several
members of the Mexican federal police force were linked to the
killings. One was convicted last year.
   Eight more men are charged with murder and conspiracy in the
case, including Caro-Quintero, who is in custody awaiting trial in
Mexico City.
   Camarena and his pilot are believed to have been killed at
Caro-Quintero's home in Guadalajara. Zuno-Arce formerly owned the
home, according to his arrest warrant. The agent's body was found on
a ranch 65 miles from Guadalajara.

   British authorities in West Berlin have installed
ladders along the bank of a river where East Germans have tried to
swim to the West, a British spokesman said today.
   Diplomatic spokeswoman Biddy Brett Rooks said the ladders, which
are like those used in swimming pools, were installed ``for
humanitarian reasons.'' However, she declined to say they were
specifically aimed at helping escaping East Germans climb out of the
water.
   ``Our purpose is to help anyone in the water, however they got
there,'' the spokeswoman said.
   The ladders and a stretch of rope were placed last week on the
western bank of the Spree River in the British sector of West
Berlin, she said. Communist East Berlin lies on the other side of
the river.
   During one dramatic escape attempt in February, Martin Notev was
grabbed by East German border guards in a patrol boat after he had
touched the western bank of the Spree.
   Britain, the United States, and France protested, saying the
21-year-old East German man had already reached the West although he
was still in the water.
   Notev was sentenced to prison, but East Germany reversed itself
and freed him after the Western protests. He was sent to West Berlin
on June 21.
   Berlin was split into sectors controlled by Western allies and
the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. The East built the
fortified Berlin Wall in 1961 in an effort to prevent East Germans
from escaping.

<TEXT>
   Republican congressional candidate Bob Lanier,
who is running for former House Speaker Jim Wright's seat, got an
Oval Office chat today with fellow Texan George Bush but did not get
a commitment for a presidential campaign appearance.
   The president squeezed in an early morning Oval Office visit with
Lanier and his wife, Sandy, that was arranged on short notice at the
request of Texas GOP officials.
   Lanier, who finished atop a field of eight during the first round
of balloting Saturday, flew to the capital Monday night after the
White House sent word that he'd better hurry if he wanted to see
Bush before the president leaves Wednesday for a nearly three-week
vacation in Maine.
   Lanier, 44, a pediatrician and allergist who hosts the syndicated
``60 Second House Call'' show, faces an early September runoff
against Democrat Pete Geren, a lawyer and former aide to Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas.
   Lanier led the field with 39 percent of the vote to Geren's 32
percent. Wright is backing Geren in the runoff.
   Lanier said Bush did not promise to campaign in Fort Worth for
him.
   ``We really hadn't discussed what his plans are going to be. I
think he's about ready to do two or three weeks in Kennebunkport,''
said Lanier. ``It hasn't really been addressed or promised one way
or the other yet.''

   Troops today stormed a prison and
killed 16 convicts who had taken 15 members of a religious group
hostage in an escape attempt and murdered five of them, including a
teen-ager.
   The bloody assault ended a three-day standoff at the Metropolitan
District Command Detention Center and came five hours after the
convicts tried to flee by using hostages as shields.
   During the attempted break, five hostages escaped but a
16-year-old female captive died, along with one convict, officials
said. The remaining 15 inmates then retreated to the jail compound.
   Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccay, the regional military commander, said
officials decided to storm the jail after the escaped hostages told
them some captives had been slain.
   In all, five hostages died. Baccay said none died in the police
assault.
   The hostages were seized Sunday during religious services at the
downtown jail in Davao City, 610 miles southeast of Manila.
   One of those slain was missionary Jacqueline Hamill, 36, of
Sydney, Australian, who had been working in Davao City since last
month. Cecilia So, a nurse at Davao Doctors' Hospital, said Miss
Hamill was pronounced dead on arrival after the assault.
   All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a
Protestant group that conducted a prison ministry. The inmates,
including murderers, asked for a getaway vehicle and gave
authorities a 4 p.m. deadline to meet their demand.
   Maj. Antonio Inciong of the military's Civil Relations Service
said Miss Hamill and other female captives were sexually molested by
their captors. Officials said about nine of the hostages were women.
   Military and civilian negotiators had been holding talks with the
inmates since late Sunday in an effort to peacefully resolve the
crisis.
   But about 10 a.m. today, military spokesman Maj. Wilfredo Garcia
said the inmates announced they were leaving the detention center
with their prisoners.
   ``The hostage takers started firing when they broke out,'' Garcia
said. ``Heavy firing ensued.''
   Convict leader Mohammed Naser Samparani, a former air force
soldier serving a 27-year sentence for murder, was killed in the
attempted escape, along with hostage Julieta Verzosa, 16.
   After the first burst of gunfire, the inmates remained holed up
inside the compound until the military attacked. Before the assault,
reporters could see four bodies, three male and one female, stacked
up in the area controlled by the inmates. It appeared the four had
been slain after the breakout failed.
   On Monday, former Rep. Jesus Dureza, who was negotiating with the
gunmen, said Samparani threatened to ``waste all my bullets into the
Australian'' unless officials provided the convicts with a getaway
vehicle.
   There were conflicting reports about how the hostage drama began.
Justice Undersecretary Silvestre Bello said the convicts overpowered
a guard and then looted an armory for weapons.
   But the Rev. Jamuel Ducurme, who had attended Sunday's prison
services, said the incident began after Samparani, a prison trusty,
asked to take food to the wife of a soldier who lived next to the
jail.
   Samparani returned a few moments later with an M-16 rifle, fired
warning shots and seized the hostages, Ducurme said. The pastor said
he was allowed to leave.
   Police said most of the inmates were believed to have been from a
group that escaped in April from the Davao Penal Colony and seized
several hostages to protest conditions at the prison.
   They surrendered after being promised they would be transferred
to the Muntinlupa prison, in a Manila suburb, but the promise was
never fulfilled.
   Officials said later the promised transfer could not be carried
out because the inmates faced additional charges in Davao City in
connection with the penal colony escape.

   Such attacks on Kabul, which have occurred almost daily since
late June, have been blamed by the government on U.S.-backed
guerrillas. The guerrillas say they attack only military targets.
   Several other rockets also struck other parts of the capital
today, but there was no immediate word on casualties.
   One airport official said nine rockets hit the airport.
   Several struck near the main passenger terminal during busy
morning hours, airport officials said on condition of anonymity.
   They reported one government soldier injured. They said no
passengers were injured and a runway was slightly damaged.
   There was no report of damage to civilian airplanes.
   The airport also has a military section, and it was not known if
anything was damaged there.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said today that
299 rockets had been fired on Kabul in the past four weeks, killing
188 civilians and injuring 483.
   The guerrillas are fighting to overthrow the country's
Soviet-backed Marxist government.

<HEAD>Bones Show Indians Led Harsh Life Under Spaniards But Lived Longer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of the skeletons of 268
Indians buried in the 17th century on Amelia Island shows they were
overworked and underfed by their Spanish masters, scientists say.
   But the researchers are puzzled because the Indians lived longer
than ancestors who were better fed and didn't have to carry burdens
for the Spanish, said Rebecca Saunders, supervisor of the
archaeologists.
   The study of the bones, she said, showed that the Guale and
Yamasee Indians' diets were nutritionally deficient and that they
suffered from arthritis in their vertebrae and feet, indicating they
had carried many heavy loads.
   ``What we have learned from this is that both the Guale men and
women were used as bearers by the Spanish,'' Ms. Saunders said in
Monday's Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville.
   The remains were unearthed at the sites of two mission
graveyards. Excavation began four years ago when a backhoe, clearing
land for a house, uncovered a graveyard.
   Researchers found that many of the Indians lived to what was then
the ripe old age of 40, Ms. Saunders said. The Indians who lived in
the area in the 1400s ate better but rarely reached that age.
   ``It's a contradiction that we have not been able to solve,''
said Ms. Saunders, who is writing a dissertation on the missions for
the University of Florida.
   Ten archaeologists from the university plan to excavate areas
where once stood the house where the Franciscan missionaries lived;
their cookhouse, and a circular structure that might have been part
of the mission village.
   The scientists also will attempt to locate the site of the
mission church.

northeastern peninsula popular with tourists.
   An official of the National Forest Fire Control Center said the
fires have destroyed over 1,200 acres of land, mostly forests, since
they started two days ago.
   He said strong northerly winds continued to blow across the

<HEAD>Newspaper Apologizes for Reporting Prime Minister Had Illegitimate
Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper has apologized for reporting that
Toshiki Kaifu, the new prime minister, fathered an illegitimate
child, and it said the story was nothing more than ``groundless
rumors.''
   The Nagoya Times, which is published in Kaifu's central home
district, printed the story Aug. 4 as he was emerging as the most
likely successor to Sousuke Uno.
   Uno resigned after 69 days in office amid allegations he kept
paid mistresses. His predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, quit to take
responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal involving
high-ranking members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   In its apology Monday, The Times said the story originated in a
letter from a reader. The paper said it later investigated the woman
who supposedly had the illegitimate child and found no evidence to
back her claims.
   Kaifu, elected prime minister by Parliament's lower house on
Wednesday, angrily denied the newspaper report. He said he had asked
the paper to apologize and publish a retraction.
   Sueo Ishida, editor of the 140,000-circulation evening newspaper,
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the paper's
president, Tadashi Yokouchi, met with Kaifu chief secretary Shozen
Kanaishi in Tokyo on Monday to apologize for the report.
   Ishida said details of the talks were not known, but Kanaishi
accepted the apology.

<HEAD>High Rates, Prices Keep Resales Low</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High mortgage rates and rising prices continued
to plague sales of existing homes in the second quarter, a real
estate trade group reported today, with 41 states and the District
of Columbia posting declines.
   At the same time, the National Association of Realtors said
booming prices made housing most expensive on the West Coast and the
Northeast in the April-June period.
   The median price of a home in the San Francisco Bay area, the
most expensive market, was $265,700, the Realtors said, compared
with Peoria, Ill., which had the lowest median price of $47,700.
   The median price means half of the houses sold for more and half
for less.
   The Realtors said their quarterly survey of sales of previously
owned homes showed a seasonally adjusted annual resale rate of 3.72
million units, down 3.1 percent from the January-March quarter.
   NAR President Ira Gribin said the sales reflected a lagging
response to drops in interest rates that began in May.
   ``It took some time for the market to turn,'' he said. ``Now, the
people who can afford to get in the market are house-hunting.''
   But Gribin said the survey also indicates that home ownership is
slipping further out of reach for first-time buyers in areas with
expensive housing.
   ``High-cost areas are losing their entry-level market,'' he said,
and in some high-cost markets, mortgage rates are forcing buyers to
purchase less-expensive homes.
   Washington, D.C., was the only area outside of the West Coast and
Northeast ranking near the top of the price list. The nation's
capital had a median price of $139,900.
   Ranked second in the median price list behind San Francisco was
Honolulu, with a price of $265,500, followed by Orange County,
Calif., $247,600; Los Angeles, $218,000; and Boston, $188,600.
   The report said 22 metropolitan areas recorded median prices
exceeding the national median of $92,900 for the second quarter.
Forty-three areas recorded annual median price increases exceeding
the national price increase of 4 percent.
   By region, the West posted an 18.7 percent median price increase
in the second quarter over the April-June quarter of 1988. It was
followed by the Midwest, up 4.9 percent; the South, up 4.6 percent;
and the Northeast, up 3.5 percent.
   The Northeast was the only region to post an increase in sales of
existing homes, up 1.3 percent to an annual rate of 790,000 units,
the Realtors said.
   The West, paced by California, registered a 7.2 percent decrease
to a 640,000 annual pace. California's resale pace, 523,700 units
and highest of all the states, dropped 14.9 percent.
   In the Midwest, sales of existing homes fell 3.1 percent to a
rate of 950,000 units and in the South, they were down 2.9 percent
to a resale pace of 1.35 million units.

<HEAD>High Court Reinstates Murder Charges Despite Police Misconduct</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' highest court reinstated murder
charges against a man accused of killing a detective, despite what
the justices called ``contemptible and disgusting'' police
misconduct in the case.
   Police cheered the decision Monday by the Supreme Judicial Court
that Albert Lewin can be tried for the 1988 slaying of Sherman
Griffiths. But defense attorneys said the ruling would encourage
police to fabricate evidence.
   Three Boston detectives threw the murder investigation into
turmoil last spring when they admitted they had created a fictitious
informant to obtain a search warrant for the drug raid in which
Griffiths was shot.
   In March, Superior Court Judge Charles M. Grabau dismissed the
murder charge against Lewin, 33, saying police had prevented a fair
trial by repeatedly lying about the informant.
   Writing for the majority in the high court's 4-2 ruling, Justice
Herbert Wilkins said, ``In order to express its outrage at the
reprehensible police conduct in this case, society need not punish
itself by freeing a man who may be guilty of murder in the first
degree and other serious crimes.''
   Wilkins said the ``contemptible and disgusting misconduct by
police officers in blatant violation of their sworn duties'' would
not prevent a fair trial.
   Griffiths, 36, was shot to death as he tried to break in the door
of Lewin's apartment. Lewin has been in jail for more than a year
awaiting trial.
   The three officers who testified about the fictitious informant
have been suspended pending a perjury investigation.
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache applauded the court's
decision, saying he was happy for Griffiths' widow that Lewin would
be brought to trial.
   He said Boston police officers ``are ordinary human beings'' who
work under extraordinary pressure.
   A lawyer for Lewin, Patricia Garin, said the ruling ``sets a
precedent for toleration of massive perjury by the police and it
vindicates them in their `anything goes' strategy.''
   Harvey Silverglate, co-chairman of the Massachusetts Association
of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the decision will ``make it
increasingly likely that police will be allowed to frame innocent
citizens.''
   In two dissents, Chief Justice Paul Liacos and Justice Ruth
Abrams said the majority opinion essentially condoned police
misconduct.
   ``Because of the officers' lies, the defendant languished in jail
while court proceedings continued with what the court has
characterized as `perfidious' police conduct,'' Abrams wrote.

<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski today called
for a joint meeting as soon as possible of the country's major
political leaders to find a ``rational solution'' for the deepening
governmental crisis.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, meanwhile, said he is willing to
serve as prime minister ``if society wants it.''
   Earlier, Walesa welcomed Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak's decision to give
up trying to form a government, as one of Poland's two minor parties
endorsed Walesa's bid to form the next government.
   The developments came one day after Kiszczak offered to resign as
prime minister in the face of opposition from Solidarity, and urged
instead that pro-communist Peasant Party leader Roman Malinowski
form a coalition government that would include both communists and
the free trade movement.
   Solidarity has rejected such offers previously, saying only a
government headed by the opposition and dominated by non-communists
will have the credibility necessary to solve Poland's political and
economic problems.
   Jaruzelski ``expresses his concern over the deepening instability
of Poland's political and economic situation,'' a communique on the
state's PAP news agency announced.
   ``The president intends to appeal to representatives of the main
political forces in the country for participation in a joint meeting
devoted to seeking rational solutions ... as soon as possible,'' PAP
said.
   Poland's economy particularly is in disarray, with industrial
production falling, shortages of basic commodities common, its
foreign debt at a burdensome $39 billion and growing and rising
inflation.
   Associates have said that under such conditions that Walesa
himself might be willing to serve as prime minister.
   In a statement issued by Walesa today, he said:
   ``Gen. Kiszczak's declaration expressing readiness to resign ...
was received by myself as resulting from a feeling of responsibility
for Poland, and a step opening new possibilities to solve the
current government crisis.''
   Walesa, who is not a member of Parliament, said his offer of a
coalition government of Solidarity, the Peasants and the Democratic
Party ``is today the only chance to change the course of events
dangerous for the country.''
   Such a government, he said, would be ``a government of national
responsibility, nominated with respect for the rights of the Polish
president.''
   Walesa apparently was referring to the constitutional rights of
the newly elected Jaruzelski to control foreign policy and the armed
forces. Presumably, Solidarity would nominate for the defense,
interior and foreign ministries only candidates acceptable to
Jaruzelski.
   Despite those assurances, the prospect of a Solidarity-led
government has alarmed both the communist Polish United Workers
Party and the Soviet Union, which has said it could be destabilizing
both for Poland and Europe.
   Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek has said the
party also fears a Solidarity-led government would purge a large
segment of the ``nomenklatura'' _ party functionaries who hold tens
of thousands of government and management posts.
   The nomination of Malinowski, a non-communist but long allied
with the communists, was apparently the party's effort to offer an
alternative to a Solidarity-led government that Poland's East bloc
and party hardliners could not accept.
   The resignation of a communist premier because the opposition
will not endorse his bid to form a government _ and the plausible
attempt by Solidarity to form a government against the wishes of the
Polish and Soviet communist parties _ demonstrates how radically
East bloc politics have changed.
   Such events would not have been thinkable even a year ago.
   Malinowski has not publicly replied to Kiszczak's suggestion that
he form the government. But he already faces opposition from
Solidarity and from within his own party, among others.
   If Solidarity would succeed in its push to win the prime
minister's post, it would be the first non-communist government in
the East bloc since the late 1940's.
   Kiszczak, elected prime minister on Aug. 2, said he would contact
Jaruzelski and ask him ``to draw proper conclusions from the
situation.''
   Faced with the difficulty of winning a majority in Parliament
despite opposition from the Solidarity caucus that makes up 35
percent of the chamber, the longtime interior minister blamed
Walesa's proposal for prolonging and complicating the problem of
forming a government.
   Walesa announced Aug. 7 that he wanted to form the Solidarity-led
coalition. His representatives commenced talks Thursday with the
Peasant and Democratic parties, which hold the balance of power in
parliament, amid signs the discussions were going positively.
   In essence, the Peasant and Democrat parties, once regarded as
little more than communist fronts, have been thrown into the role of
kingmakers because neither the Communist Party nor Solidarity has an
absolute majority in Parliament.

   Inessa Stateikim had flowing red hair until a
bargain permanent at a beauty college burned her scalp and caused
her hair to fall out in clumps, she testified in a $6 million fraud
trial against the school.
   ``I was bald,'' she told jurors. ``I couldn't stop crying. ... I
stayed home for a year.''
   Ms. Stateikim testified Monday in a federal class-action lawsuit
accusing the D'Or Beauty College of consumer fraud and seeking
damages for 1,404 students who attended D'Or's two schools since
1983.
   The students charge the school with misrepresentation and failing
to provide adequate training. They say few students graduate or pass
the state licensing examination.
   The school has been barred from participating in federal student
aid programs.
   Ms. Stateikim was a student in D'Or's three-month manicurist's
course when she received a permanent in 1984. No supervisor was on
hand, she said.
   Ms. Stateikim said she had to see a doctor for her burning scalp.
She got a wig and became a recluse until her hair grew back.

   Masked rioters hurling
gasoline bombs and rocks clashed with riot police in the streets of
Londonderry today, the 20th anniversary of the deployment of British
troops in the city. Officers arrested an Irish-American activist.
   Martin Galvin, publicity director of the New York-based Irish
Northern Aid Committee, was accused of violating a ban on entering
British territory.
   Police say the group collects money to buy arms for the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland. Galvin said the money is for families of victims
of the province's violence.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the British police force, said
three hours of pre-dawn violence occurred in the city's Roman
Catholic Bogside area, where two decades ago crowds barricaded
streets in battles with police.
   Police fired dozens of plastic bullets to disperse rioters, who
wore masks to hide their identities from authorities. Two men were
hit but were not believed to be seriously hurt, police said.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said at one
stage gunshots were heard, apparently fired at police, and that
officers later were reported to have fired in the air to scare off
the rioters.
   Police said a small homemade explosive device was thrown at an
armored police Land Rover, rocking the vehicle and breaking windows
in nearby homes.
   The news agency quoted an unidentified local resident as saying
rioters ran down a street throwing gasoline bombs and rocks: ``This
is the worst (violence) we have had for four to five years. People
were expecting trouble but no one knew what.''
   Sporadic violence was also reported in Belfast.
   Galvin, 39, was bundled into a police jeep and driven away after
taking a well-publicized walk through Londonderry.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in London said Galvin would be
flown to the British mainland and handed over to immigration
officials. The spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Galvin was expected to be deported.
   Galvin has visited the province at least four times since 1984
despite being ordered by Britain to stay out.
   On Monday, several thousand IRA supporters paraded peacefully
through the Bogside neighborhood. They marched into the old walled
city, a historic Protestant stronghold, and walked past the ruins of
a building shattered by an IRA bomb two days earlier.
   ``We've all risked our lives for 20 years and I say, fight on,''
said Martin McGuinness, once the top IRA commander in the city and
now a vice president of the IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein.
   ``I'm here to pay tribute to the troops of the Irish Republican
Army,'' McGuinness said.
   Earlier, he read off the names of 37 members of the IRA's Derry
Brigade who have died since ``the troubles'' began in August 1969.
   Sinn Fein was alone in taking such public notice of the 20th
anniversary of the British troop deployment.
   The larger Catholic party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party,
ignored it.
   James Molyneaux, leader of the largest Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists, and Democratic Unionists Party leader Rev. Ian
Paisley used the day for a first meeting with the new secretary of
state for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, the British Cabinet member
responsible for the province.
   Molyneaux and Paisley said they had emphasized the opposition of
Unionists, who support continued British rule, to the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement that guaranteed the Irish government a formal
consultative role in the running of the province.
   ``We completely disillusioned the secretary of state that the
Unionist leadership was weakened in the protest and fight to end the
agreement,'' Paisley said.
   The mainly Catholic IRA says the Anglo-Irish Agreement makes no
difference to its guerrilla. The IRA wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic
Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   The anniversary, and the preceding weekend, passed without any
additions to Northern Ireland's sectarian death toll, which has
surpassed 2,700 in 20 years.
   Security forces had feared the IRA would attempt a significant
attack to mark the date.
   On Monday, a high-ranking officer of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary contended that the violent incidents were spurred by
news media attention given to the anniversary.
   ``I am honestly convinced that the presence of camera crews is
keeping this going,'' said Chief Inspector Ian Williamson. There was
no evidence, he said, that the incidents had been part of any larger
pattern by any of the province's illegal paramilitary groups.

   Two cosmonauts will blast off Sept. 6
to reman the orbiting space station Mir after a four-month lapse
dictated by finances and technical delays, space officials announced
today.
   The new six-month mission by flight commander Alexander S.
Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A. Serebrov will include a ride
outside Mir in a new ``space motorcycle.''
   Serebrov, a veteran of two earlier space flights, and Viktorenko,
who flew once before, are to blast off the night of Sept. 6 aboard a
Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur space center in the republic of
Kazakhstan, officials said.
   Mir, the showcase of the Soviet space program, was launched in
February 1986. Though designed to be permanently manned, it was
vacated April 27 when three cosmonauts rocketed back to Earth.
   Officials have said it was vacated to save money and because two
new modules for the station were not ready.
   The Soviet space program has come under fire recently for heavy
spending at a time when the country is suffering a $192 billion
budget deficit and shortages of food and other basic consumer goods.
   A 20-ton module containing the space motorcycle, a new space
shower and a new hatch for space walks will be launched in October
and attached to Mir, Serebrov told a news conference in Star City,
the cosmonaut trainin center 25 miles east of Moscow.
   Alexander N. Balandin, a backup engineer for the September
flight, said the motorcycle is similar to a maneuvering unit used by
U.S. space shuttle astronauts. The Soviet unit can travel 495 feet
from Mir for up to three hours.
   Alexei A. Leonov, deputy director of Gagarin Cosmonaut Training
Center at Star City and a former spaceman, told reporters he had
worked with Soviet engineers to develop a space motorcycle in the
early 1970s, but the project deemed unnecessary and canceled.
   A second module with equipment to grow crystals in the
weightlessness of space is to be launched in February, Serebrov said.
   The 20-ton Mir already has one module attached to it and a space
observation laboratory.
   Balandin and cosmonaut Anatoly Y. Solovyov are to join Viktorenko
and Serebrov aboard Mir in early March, officials told reporters.
   Mir had been manned for a total of 880 days by four crews since
its launch. Cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov broke space
endurance records by staying a year before returning to Earth.

   The army said today that a Shiite Moslem cleric
kidnapped by Israeli commandos is being held under administrative
detention, which allows people to be jailed without being charged or
tried.
   In Damascus, Syria, Iran's foreign minister said Israel must
unconditionally release the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, and
indicated Iran will not use its influence to free hostages in
Lebanon until Obeid is free.
   Israel's military censor, meanwhile, asked police to open an
investigation into a report in the Sunday Times of London and the
Washington Post that two of three Israeli soldiers missing in
Lebanon are dead, said Eitan Haber, spokesman for Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
   The Jerusalem Post reported today that an extensive investigation
was underway to pinpoint the source of the report. Cabinet ministers
will be investigated as well, it said.
   An army spokesman said Obeid, the Lebanese cleric kidnapped by
Israeli commandos on July 28, is being held for six months under an
administrative detention order signed by Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron. He did not say where Obeid was.
   Israel accuses Obeid of coordinating attacks by the Moslem
fundamentalist Hezbollah on Israeli troops in south Lebanon.
   Administrative detainees, generally Palestinians, are usually
allowed to have a lawyer and appeal their detention. But the army
spokesman, who is not identified under military regulations, would
not say if Obeid had such rights.
   Obeid's abduction July 28 worldwide attention after a radical
Shiite group in Lebanon claimed to have killed an American hostage,
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, in retaliation.
   Israel has demanded the release of three Israelis missing in
Lebanon as well as 16 foreign hostages in exchange for Obeid and
other Shiite Moslem prisoners. The hostage held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, today dampened hopes
his country might use its influence with kidnap groups to free the
hostages.
   ``We hope that Sheik Obeid will be released,'' he said after
arriving in Syria for talks on the Lebanese war. ``This release
should take place without any prior conditions _ no talks, no
discussions before Sheik Obeid is released.''
   On Sunday, the front pages of Israeli papers carried headlines
quoting the Sunday Times story that two of the three missing
Israelis were in fact dead.
   The story said intelligence officers questioning Obeid have
concluded that the two infantrymen died of wounds soon after their
car was ambushed in south Lebanon in February 1986.
   Israel's chief army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid, did not
confirm or deny the report but said the government considers its
soldiers to be alive unless it is given documentary proof to the
contrary.
   In another report on the hostage affair, The Independent of
London said Monday that Obeid's abduction had sabotaged sensitive
overtures by Israel to Iran and the Hezbollah to free the prisoners.
   The paper said the inner Cabinet appointed a three-man team to
negotiate with the Hezbollah that consists of Uri Lubrani, chief
coordinator of Israeli policy in Lebanon; Gen. Ran Goren, head of
the army's manpower branch; and Ori Slonim, a Tel Aviv lawyer and
confidante of Rabin.
   The team had ``opened new channels with Iran and the Hezbollah
via two Palestinan Shiites who have close links with Teheran,'' the
paper said. Frustrated by the slow progress of negotiations, Israel
kidnapped Obeid, it said.
   It said Rabin expected the kidnapping to hasten the negotiations,
but instead Hezbollah broke off the contacts in anger.
   Rabin's spokesman, Haber, refused to comment on the Independent
report. Other officials also declined to comment, saying the issue
was sensitive.
   One security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
report was ``nonsense.''

   ``Ivana'' has Ivana Trump seeing red, with the
wife of Donald Trump claiming that the lipstick is trading on her
name.
   Mrs. Trump, who runs the Plaza Hotel for her husband, has a name
that has ``become synonymous with the very best, regardless of the
project or activity,'' according to a $10 million lawsuit filed
Monday in federal court.
   Pavion, a Nyack cosmetics company, began selling Ivana lipstick
in March. Stanley Ackers, the company's president, said he did not
have Mrs. Trump in mind and did not name the lipstick after anyone
in particular.
   According to the lawsuit, Pavion tried ``to mislead the trade and
the public into believing that (Mrs.) Trump has either approved or
sponsored the goods.''
   Trump has fought several similar court battles.
   In June, he won a court order barring the Washington-based
International Trading and Finance Co. from calling its moving and
storage subsidiary Trump Shuttle _ a name Trump used weeks later
when he bought the Eastern Shuttle.

   The president, asked whether he would consider seeking the

Israelis, said, ``We have no criminal indictment'' against him. ``We
wouldn't move against somebody without the legal process going

   Bush met with reporters on the day before a scheduled two-week
vacation at the family compound in Maine.
   He opened with a statement mourning Reps. Mickey Leland of Texas
and Larkin Smith of Mississippi, who were killed in separate
airplane accidents in recent days. And he said he would return in

   Bush also appealed to the Senate to vote on more than 100

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police searched southwestern Brazil
today for four kidnappers who flew to Paraguay but then crosssed
back over the border after Paraguayan authorities opened fire on
their plane.
   Police chief Francisco Pedro Fontoura in Toledo, a farming city
1,215 miles southwest of Rio, said police had found a truck stolen
by the fugitives 25 miles southeast of the city.
   ``The truck had mechanical problems and was abandoned by the
fugitives,'' Fontoura said by telephone. ``I think they're probably
holed up in a house nearby, possibly with other criminals.''
   The fugitives, identified as two married couples, kidnapped
9-year-old Said Agel on Aug. 3 in the central city of Goiania.
Police discovered their hideout, and the kidnappers exchanged the
boy for a $42,000 ransom and three local television reporters who
offered themselves as hostages. One of the reporters later was
released.
   The kidnappers and the remaining hostages left Goiania in an
armored car and fled through three states to Sao Paulo state, in
southwestern Brazil. On Sunday they traded the armored car for a
plane, released the hostages and flew to Paraguay.
   Federal police said the plane landed at a clandestine airstrip
used by smugglers near the city of Hernandarias, near the border
with Brazil. But Paraguayan police fired on the plane and it
returned to Brazil on Monday.

   A former CIA operative who was a key figure in
the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver L. North is hospitalized after
suffering a heart attack.
   Glenn Robinette, now a security consultant, said in a telephone
interview today that suffered the attack last Friday and is expected
to remain hospitalized until the weekend.
   Robinette testified at North's trial that he and the former
National Security Council aide created phony documents to disguise
the fact that someone else had paid for a $16,000 security fence at
North's home.
   North was convicted on three counts in the Iran-Contra affair,
including the acceptance of an illegal gratuity _ the fence.
   Robinette, who testified under a grant of immunity, said he
received money for the fence from arms dealer Richard V. Secord.
Secord, who worked with North in the plan to divert money from the
sale of weapons to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, is
scheduled to go on trial Nov. 13.

<TEXT>
   An air fare skirmish has intensified into a war,
as major U.S. airlines extend bargains on summer travel into the
historically weak fall season.
   Trans World Airlines started the move Sunday, announcing it was
cutting round-trip fares by as much as $160 to lure passengers in
the fall. TWA also said it would lower certain international fares
into next spring.
   The reductions were matched Monday by Pan American World Airways,
USAir, United Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines and
Eastern Airlines in markets where they compete with TWA.
   American Airlines and Delta Air Lines went one better by matching
the cuts for all the mainland U.S. cities they serve, not only those
where they compete with TWA.
   Spokesman Jim Brown in Dallas said American would match TWA's new
fares to Europe on a competitive basis. Delta spokesman Jim Lundy in
Atlanta said early today his company had not yet decided on cuts for
international fares.
   Pan Am also cut fares across its entire overseas network except
for the Soviet Union, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners in New York.
   The reduced fares are available for domestic flights from Sept. 9
to Dec. 15 and for international flights from Oct. 1 to May 21.
Reservations must be made by Sept. 1.
   Air fares had been steadily rising in recent months amid strong
passenger traffic and may have peaked for awhile, industry analysts
say. Continental started a round of cuts Aug. 2 when it reduced to
$75 each way its weekend fares through Labor Day on most non-stop
flights, and lowered transcontinental weekend fares to $100 each way.
   ``I think traffic is strong enough that (the new discounts) can
put on some incremental passengers; it's free money,'' said Kevin
Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   An unusual arrangement in the latest fare-cutting allows one
change in travel dates. Discount fares normally prohibit such
changes. In addition, a ``lowest fare guarantee'' ensures that if
fares are reduced further after a ticket is purchased, passengers
will be refunded the difference.
   ``TWA wants to stimulate traffic during the historically weak
fall travel period, and passengers who act now will be getting a
great deal,'' Robert Cozzi, TWA's senior vice president of
marketing, said in a statement.
   The offer covers more than 100 cities worldwide, he said.
   Examples of TWA's new round-trip fares for travel on Tuesday and
Wednesday are: St. Louis-Dallas, $148; New York-Los Angeles, $198;
Chicago-Denver, $168; and San Antonio-Washington, $198.
   Round-trip fares to Europe have been cut by about $100. Examples
of one-way fares from New York on TWA starting Nov. 1 are: London,
$149; Paris, $199; Frankfurt, West Germany, $189; Madrid, Spain,
$213; and Rome, $232.

<HEAD>Parents Of Student Slain By Drug Cult Meet With Bush, Bennett</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a Texas college student killed
in a ritual slaying by members of a drug cult told President Bush
today that for every drug user there are victims and suffering.
   Jim and Helen Kilroy were among about a dozen people meeting with
Bush and national drug policy director William J. Bennett as the
administration prepares its first comprehensive strategy for
fighting drugs, due out Sept. 5.
   The Kilroys said Bush was ``very sensitive'' to what happened to
their son, who disappeared in the Mexican border town of Matamoros
while in spring break.
   His body was later found in a mass grave on a ranch outside the
city, and had been dismembered by the drug cult, which believed that
human sacrifices would protect their illegal activities.
   Bennett said the nation suffered with the Kilroys a couple of
months ago, ``but since that time the Kilroys have taken their pain
and their tragedy and turned it into a ... very good effort.''
   The Santa Fe, Texas, couple have founded the Mark Kilroy
Foundation, which Kilroy said emphasizes education against the use
of illegal drugs, and that the use of drugs causes much suffering.
   ``The government has to enforce the laws because right now people
sell drugs, use drugs at will. I think that has to be at all levels,
local state and federal,'' he said after the White House meeting.
   ``That's the one thing we said to President Bush, there is a need
for enforcement,'' Kilroy said.
   ``I believe the drug dealers know exactly what they're doing and
that they should be punished,'' Mrs. Kilroy said.
   Mrs. Kilroy said even casual drug use has terrible effects.
   ``There is so much suffering we definitely should make every
effort possible to see an end to it in our generation,'' Kilroy said.
   Mrs. Kilroy said Bush and Bennett did not issue any specific
recommendations for fighting drugs, but she is satisfied the
administration is ``moving in the right direction'' and praised Bush
and Bennett for asking others about what can be done.
   ``I think the federal government will do its part, but that all
of us are going to have to do our part too. It's going to take the
entire nation, everyone doing their part to rid our country of this
terrible crisis,'' Mrs. Kilroy said.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Tuesday.
   Good morning.
   Let me first have a brief statement and then I'd be glad to
respond to questions.
   I want to note again the passing of two outstanding public
servants, Congressmen Mickey Leland and Larkin Smith.
   They lost their lives in tragic aircraft accidents.
   Their passing is mourned by everyone who knew them.
   And Barbara and I extend our sympathies to their families and
friends during this difficult period.
   Their death also reminds us that there are outstanding men and
women in public life who are working at every level of government to
better the lot of mankind.
   And these two fine individuals represented a deep caring for the
poor, the disadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and
many other areas of our society that need improving.
   In the last two days, I've attended meetings to consider our new
national strategy to deal with the drug problem.
   And it's an issue that tears at the heart and feeds the fears of
every American.
   Just yesterday we learned that more than 75 percent of Americans
say they favor tougher drug laws.
   Teen-agers find drugs the biggest problem facing their generation.
   And it's clear in these surveys and from hundreds of personal
stories of tragedy that we hear every day that drug abuse is a
national menace and that the central government must attack it with
every means at its disposal.
   Bill Bennett has given me now an outline of our national strategy.
   It's balanced, decisive, effective and achievable, and it will
target all aspects of the problem.
   It will call for commitment and sacrifice and understanding, but
it's clear to me that the American people demand no less.
   And we'll be working on the final points of this strategy over
the next few weeks, and I'll present to the American people, on
Sept. 5, a coordinated counterattack involving all basic anti-drug
initiatives and agencies.

   A Chinese airliner with 54 people aboard crashed
today near Shanghai, killing at least 18 passengers and crew
members, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
   The plane plunged into a river after an aborted takeoff from
Hongqiao Airport, about 14 miles north of Shanghai, at 3:46 p.m.,
the report said.
   Earlier, Xinhua said 33 passengers and crew members were killed,
but a later report said 18 died and rescue efforts were contuinuing.
Xinhua did not explain the discrepancy.
   Reports received by the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai said 54
people were on board the flight.
   The plane was a Soviet-designed Antonov-24 on flight 5510 of
China's flag carrier, the Civil Aviation Administration of China. It
was en route from Shanghai to the southern city of Nanchang.
   Officials at the CAAC office in Shanghai contacted by telephone
said they could not immediately confirm the report.
   It was the first crash involving a Chinese airliner since last
August, when a flight from Canton crashed while landing at Hong Kong
International Airport, killing seven people.
   Last year, Chinese airlines were involved in five major accidents
that killed 172 people. CAAC Chief Hu Yizhou acknowledged early this
year that the airline's safety record has ``serious problems'' and
called for improvements in air safety.

   A 13-year-old boy shot and killed his
best friend and kept the body in his bedroom closet for two days,
authorities say.
   Sheriff's Sgt. John Faile said the slaying of 10-year-old Darrell
Dwayne Dockery may have been an accident.
   Officers began looking for the boy Saturday night and found the
body late Monday, shot once in the side, in the home of his
unidentified friend, who was taken into custody on juvenile charges
of manslaughter and negligent homicide.
   ``They were good friends, always together here or at the other
boy's house,'' said Raymond Boisclair, Dwayne's stepfather. ``But
the whole time we were looking for Dwayne, that boy never called or
offered to help. I thought that was kind of odd.''
   Dwayne was last seen by his family Saturday morning, when he said
he was going to his friend's house two blocks away to see if he
wanted to go fishing.
   Ronnie Bowen, director of the youth aid division of the sheriff's
office, said officers questioned the 13-year-old, who said the
10-year-old had left the house.
   But the older boy came under suspicion because he ``didn't act
like a normal 13-year-old,'' Bowen said. The boy eventually told
officers where to find the body, Bowen said. He said it appeared
Dwayne was shot with a rifle.
   Boisclair said the boys ``never had a fight that we ever heard
them in.''

   President Bush said today that the new
drug-fighting strategy he will unveil next month is ``balanced,
decisive, effective and achievable'' and said the American people
demand no less.
   The president, at a news conference, called attention to a new
Gallup poll that found overwhelming numbers of teen-agers think
drugs are the biggest problem facing their generation.
   ``It is clear in these surveys that drug abuse is a national
menace and that the central government must attack it with every
means at its disposal,'' Bush said.
   Asked if he was willing to raise taxes to pay for the anti-drug
fight, the president said, ``We're not going to have to, but we are
going to expand federal expenditures.''
   Asked where the money was coming, he said, ``Stay tuned, and we
will show you in September how we're going to allocate the resources
for this.''
   The poll, released on Monday at the White House, said teen-agers
and adults alike view drug abuse as the most important problem
facing the country _ eclipsing fear of war, the economy, AIDS,
crime, abortion and alcohol abuse as top concerns.
   The president gave no specifics of what the new strategy, to be
released Sept. 5 after he returns from his vacation, will be. ``This
will be a rather comprehensive national strategy,'' he said.
   ``There is a little bit of good news out there,'' Bush said.
``There is a decline in the casual use of cocaine that's taking
place.'' He said more can be done with education to counter the
demand for drugs and that efforts to cut the supply line have also
had some effect.
   One adult in four and one teen-ager in three has come to believe
that drug abuse is the country's greatest problem, said the poll,
and six in 10 teen-agers believe it is the greatest problem facing
their generation.
   William Bennett, the national drug policy coordinator, said
Monday that the poll results ``give a very clear sense of
direction'' to the administration in its strategy.
   ``In times of crisis such as war, the public is willing to make
great sacrifices to the public good,'' said George H. Gallup. ``In
key ways today, the American people are in a wartime mode and sense
a national emergency in the drug crisis.''
   Only six years ago, in a similar poll, unemployment most bothered
53 percent of adults; drugs and drug abuse did not register. Four
years ago it was the top concern of only 2 percent. In the telephone
conducted by the Gallup Organization in June and July it was the top
worry of 27 percent.
   ``In the 50 years that the U.S. public has been asked to name the
most important problem facing the nation, it is virtually
unprecedented for any social issue to appear at the top of the
list,'' Gallup said.
   People are so disturbed, he said, that three-fourths of all
teen-agers and nearly half of adults are ready to volunteer to help
in drug prevention programs, education and treatment.
   ``A record number of Americans cite the drug crisis as the
nation's top problem, replacing the `guns and butter' issues of
international tensions and economic worries,'' he told a news
conference also attended by Bennett.
   After drugs and drug abuse the top concerns by adults were
poverty, homelessness and hunger, 8 percent; the economy in general,
7 percent, and the federal budget deficit and the environment, 6
percent each.
   Next came crime, inflation, other economic problems, and a
decline in morals, each with 3 percent; then abortion, unemployment,
the trade deficit and dissatisfaction with government, at 2 percent,
and quality of education, 1 percent.
   Twelve percent of adults listed other problems at the top, and
the rest said they had no answer.
   Fear of war, the category listed the most worrisome by 27 percent
of adults in 1985 and 23 percent in 1987, was listed first by only 4
percent in the new survey.
   Drug abuse was listed by 32 percent of teen-agers as the most
important problem facing the country, ahead of fear of war, 14
percent; economic issues, 13 percent; environment and pollution, 7
percent; political issues, 6 percent; AIDS, 5 percent; crime, 3
percent; abortion, 2 percent; and alcohol abuse, 1 percent. Nine
percent of the teen-agers listed other concerns and the rest said
they didn't know.
   Gallup interviewed 1,005 adults and 500 teen-agers in the
telephone poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points for the adults and 6 percentage points for the
teen-agers.
   In the new survey, 60 percent of the teen-agers questioned said
drug abuse is the biggest problem confronting their age group _
nearly twice the number saying it is the biggest problem for the
country. For their age group, 13 percent said the worst problem was
peer pressures, 11 percent said alcohol, and 8 percent said teen-age
pregnancy.
   Considered the top problem by 3 percent or less: school problems,
teen-age gangs, problems in growing up, unemployment, teen-age
suicide, getting along with parents and career uncertainties. AIDS
and fear of war were listed first by less than 1 percent.

   But let me emphasize here that the federal government cannot do
it alone.
   Local communities and states and individuals and families must
help.
   I'm being told in these meetings of the last few days that the
American people are ready to take on this fight.
   Late August is a traditional vacation period, but we cannot
forget the full agenda that faces America at this time: our
hostages, the Middle East, Lebanon, drugs, the budget, and so many
other matters.
   In addition, the Congress is considering more than 100 of our
nominees for government positions, and we need these people.
   And I urge the Congress to make this a top priority when they
come back.
   All of these issues will be on my mind as we prepare for the hard
work of the fall.
   And so on this last day before vacation, I'll miss you, but _ let
me just see _ Norm?
   Q. Mr. President, your spokesman said yesterday that significant
progress had been made in pursuing the issue of the hostages. We're
told that you've been on the phone to foreign leaders, that there's
been a flurry of diplomatic contacts. But can you say today that
we're any closer to seeing the hostages released than we were, say,
about three weeks ago when the Israeli seizure of Sheik Obeid set
into motion this chain of developments that seems to have raised
expectations or hopes of a breakthrough?
   A. Norm, I can't say that today, but we're going to keep on
trying.
   But I cannot give you a definitive assessment of that.
   I just don't know.
   There's a lot of lines out there, a lot of initiatives have been
taken.
   As I said earlier, the cooperation that we've received, some that
we've solicited and some unsolicited, from leaders around the world,
it's just been magnificent.
   But I can't give you that, you know, positive assessment at this
point.
   Q. Can I follow up on just one path that was pursued on that. In
the absence of an exchange of prisoners, have you considered the
extradition of Sheik Obeid to this country to face criminal charges?
   A. No, we have no criminal indictment against Sheik Obeid.
   Q. Is that any kind of a legal option?
   A. Well, we don't _ we wouldn't move against somebody without the
legal process going forward.
   Q. Mr. President, what does it mean when you pointedly remind
Iran that ``goodwill begets goodwill.'' The United States wants the
return of the hostages in Lebanon. If that occurred, what would the
United States do in return for Iran?
   A. Too hypothetical to answer, but I would simply repeat that we
are looking for signs of change, certainly when it comes to holding
of hostages.
   We all know that we've had some major differences with Iran and
the question of state sponsorship of terrorism.
   That's a given.
   Now, we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signals
coming out of Iran, some in the old mode and then some that offer
more hope.

   The Tax Court ruling could be ``financially devastating'' to the
state, Craig Corimier, a deputy director of the state Department of
Revenue, had warned in court papers before the decision Monday by
Judge William Moroney.
   Moroney cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Michigan case that
bars states from taxing federal retirees' pay if they don't also tax
state, county and local government pensioners. The high court ruling
March 28 could affect 21 states.
   Howard Boice, a spokesman for the Revenue Department, said the
agency hadn't decided whether to appeal the ruling.
   Corimier, who has estimated the cost of the ruling at $160
million to $210 million, noted that that the state had great
difficulty resolving a $165 million budget deficit during the last
session of the Legislature.
   Brian Luscher, attorney for three retirees whose class-action
lawsuit led to the ruling, said he was seeking refunds from 1984
through 1988.
   Since the suit was filed, Arizona passed a law making all
public-employee pensions taxable in the future.

   President Bush said today he can't offer any
assurances that American hostages held in the Middle East will be
freed anytime soon, and said his administration continues to look
for ``signs of change'' from Iran.
   ``I think that if Iran decided they wanted those hostages to come
out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would
happen, perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood,'' Bush
said.
   ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the rest of our
lives,'' he said. The United States broke off diplomatic relations
with Iran a decade ago.
   At a pre-vacation news conference at the White House, Bush was
questioned repeatedly about the possibility of military action
against those holding the hostages, and he replied that ``at some
point we have to stand up for our interests, even if it means
military, yet I'm not threatening military action.''
   Later, he added, ``If I could find a way to take those hostages,
get them, and bring them out and that required using the military
force of the United States, make no mistake about it, I would do it
in an instant.''
   The president fielded questions for 30 minutes on subjects
ranging from economic policy to drug abuse. On those topics, he:
   _ Refused to rule out kidnapping Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega to bring him to trial on drug trafficking charges.
``I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' he said.
   _ Said he was ``comfortable'' with budget director Richard
Darman's weekend comment that the Federal Reserve was keeping
interest rates too high to permit sustained growth.
   _ Promised to return from his vacation in Maine on Sept. 5 with a
comprehensive plan to attack the ``national menace'' of drug abuse.
He said his plan would include additional federal spending, but
would not require higher taxes.
   _ Said he wished the ``legal process'' could move along in the
case of Felix Bloch, a State Department official suspected of
espionage, ``without a lot of hype.'' Bloch has not been charged.
   _ Called on the Democrat-controlled Senate to act speedily on
more than 100 high-level government appointments that await
confirmation.
   _ Eulogized Reps. Mickey Leland and Larkin Smith, who died in
recent days in separate plane crashes. He said the two were ``fine
individuals (who) represented a deep caring for the poor, the
disadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and many other
areas.''
   Bush was questioned repeatedly about the hostages in the Middle
East, and the recent flurry of sensitive diplomatic efforts aimed at
winning the release of the eight Americans held in captivity.
   He noted conflicting signals emanating from Iran in recent weeks.
   ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the rest of our
lives,'' the president said. The hostages are thought to be held by
the Shiite religious group Hezbollah, a faction heavily influenced
by the Iranians.
   ``We're going to keep on trying but I can't give you a definitive
assessment'' of whether the hostages are any closer to freedom, Bush
said.
   ``I just don't know. There's a lot of lines out there, a lot of
initiatives have been taken,'' he said.
   Asked why he did not retaliate militarily after the murder of Lt.
Col. William Higgins, Bush said the United States still did not have
adequate information to take either a diplomatic or military
response. The Pentagon still is not certain when or how Higgins
died; on July 31, his captors released a videotape that showed him
hanging from a makeshift gallows.
   ``I do not want to be responsible for the loss of innocent
life,'' Bush said, adding that he was also concerned that an
American response could lead to harm for the remaining eight
hostages.
   He said that if he could mount an effective military rescue, ``I
would do it in an instant.''
   The president was asked whether he would consider seeking the
extradition of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, whose capture last month by
the Israelis outraged his religious followers. ``We have no criminal
indictment'' against Obeid in the kidnapping of Americans, Bush
said. ``We wouldn't move against somebody without the legal process
going forward.''
   Bush generally endorsed Darman's criticism that the Federal
Reserve was harming economic growth by keeping interest rates too
high.
   ``I feel very comfortable with his (Darman's) sallying forth,''
Bush said. ``I think I have said the same things in the past.''
   However, Bush stopped short of saying that if a recession
occurred, it would be the fault of policies by the central bank.
   Bush went out of his way to emphasize his commitment to a new
national plan for fighting drug abuse, and said it would take a
``full court press, not just in the federal government, but all
across society'' to deal with it. He said drug czar William Bennett
has given him a draft proposal, and said the plan he unveils next
month will be ``balanced, decisive, effective and achievable.'' He
offered no details.
   On the hostage issue, Bush said he had received ``magnificent''
cooperation from world leaders, some of it unsolicited, but he did
not identify anyone by name.
   Bush was asked about his Inauguration Day comment that goodwill
would beget goodwill in the U.S. relationship with Iran.
   ``Now we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signals
coming out of Iran, some in the old mode, some that offer more hope.
I would leave it stand that a clear and good signal would be the
release of the American hostages.''
   He added, ``I just hope that the positive signs prevail, because
there are some, they are encouraging.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of birds captured in the
forests and jungles to be sold as pets were set free Tuesday on
India's Independence Day to dramatize a campaign against cruelty to
animals.
   The freeing of the birds was led by environmental activist Maneka
Gandhi, sister-in-law and political foe of Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
   About 500 people watched as the birds were set free along the
Yamuna River at the cremation site of Mohandas K. Gandhi, leader of
the non-violent freedom struggle that culminated in India's
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Mrs. Gandhi, a leading member of the Janata Dal opposition party
that seeks to unseat the prime minister's Congress Party in
elections later this year, called the freeing of the birds ``a
soaring triumph for bird lovers.''
   The birds were bought from dealers with contributions from animal
rescue groups.

   Police patrolled suburban Constantine,
Algeria's second-largest city, after demonstrators blocked a road
and destroyed public buildings, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The eastern Algerian suburb was calm Tuesday, but police remained
in the village after a day of demonstrations that turned violent
Sunday, according to the daily newspaper El Moudjahid.
   There were no details on the cause of the demonstration or on
injuries or arrests.
   Algeria was rocked last year by violent demonstrations in the
capital brought on by a declining standard of living in the
financially-strapped North African nation. The demonstrations led to
a series of constitutional reforms, a diminishing of the power of
the ruling party and a restructuring of the government of President
Chadli Bendjedid.

<HEAD>Irish-American Activist Arrested for Entering British Province</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American pro-IRA activist
was arrested Tuesday for violating a 5-year-old order barring him
from British territory, police said.
   Lawyer Martin Galvin, publicity director of the New York-based
Irish Northern Aid Committee, or NORAID, was bundled into a police
jeep and driven away after taking a high-profile walk through
Northern Ireland's second-largest city.
   The British government said Galvin would be deported after being
flown to London's Heathrow Airport and handed over to immigration
authorities there.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd ``has no reason to alter his decision
in relation to the exclusion order made in July 1984,'' the Home
Office said. ``As an illegal entrant and the subject of an exclusion
order, Mr. Galvin will be removed from the U.K.''
   Galvin's arrest came only hours after masked rioters marked the
20th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Northern
Ireland by throwing rocks and homemade bombs at police. Riot squads
fired plastic bullets, slightly injuring two men, police said.
   Galvin, 39, has visited Northern Ireland at least four times
since 1984 despite being under a British exclusion order. He said he
arrived for this latest visit three days ago.
   ``It would have been unconscionable for me not to have been with
the nationalist people on the 20th anniversary of the arrival of the
troops,'' he told reporters.
   The exclusion order against Galvin was signed in July 1984
following a speech at Toomebridge, County Londonderry, in which he
encouraged violence the day after a soldier was killed in
Londonderry.
   A month later, police tried to arrest Galvin when he appeared on
a platform of speakers in west Belfast. Police killed a young man
with a plastic bullet when fighting broke out in the crowd of
thousands of IRA supporters. Galvin was lifted over the heads of
people in the crowd and vanished up a back street.
   The ban is difficult to enforce because movement between Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic is easy. There are many unpatrolled
roads across the border, no passport requirements and only random
checks of cars.
   In the latest incident, officers grabbed Galvin as he stood with
officials of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican army's legal political
wing, at Free Derry Corner, a symbol of Irish nationalist resistance
to British rule.
   As he was led away, Galvin shouted: ``This will attract
international attention!''
   Britain says NORAID collects funds to buy arms for the IRA.
Galvin denies this, saying the money goes to families of victims of
20 years of violence in the province.
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams called for Galvin's release,
saying the arrest was ``ironic testimony to British repression which
relies upon exclusion orders, the denial of human rights and
censorship, as well as military force to maintain its presence
here.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
said violence flared early Tuesday in the Bogside, a Roman Catholic
stronghold and scene of some of the worst sectarian violence when
the ``troubles'' broke out 20 years ago.
   Police said one homemade bomb was thrown at an armored car,
rocking the vehicle and breaking windows in nearby homes.
   In north Belfast, a bomb exploded in the Catholic Ardoyne area
and a bus and a car were hijacked and burned.
   In Coalisland, County Tyrone, a crowd of 30 people hurled
gasoline bombs at the town's police station and a bomb exploded at a
gas station in Dungannon, in the center of the province.
   Several thousand IRA supporters marked the 20-year anniversary on
Monday by marching peacefully from Creggan, another Catholic
stronghold, to Bogside. They walked into Londonderry's old walled
city, a Protestant area, and past a building wrecked by an Irish
Republican Army bomb recently.
   The IRA is fighting to unite the province and its Protestant
majority with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule. More than 2,700 people have been killed in 20 years
of fighting.

<TEXT>
   The brakeman on a train that derailed and
caught fire July 22, forcing 3,000 people from their homes for up to
a week, had used cocaine sometime in the 48 hours before the
accident, a federal agency says.
   Blood and urine samples provided by the unidentified brakeman
tested positive for the drug, the Federal Railroad Administration
said Monday in a statement. Samples from the engineer and conductor
tested negative.
   The agency did not say how much cocaine the brakeman had used and
said it had not determined exactly when use occurred.
   ``His role in the cause of the accident, if any, has yet to be
determined,'' said agency spokeswoman Claire H. Austin in Washington.
   Austin said the brakeman was in the lead locomotive of the 37-car
CSX Transportation Co. train when 14 cars derailed and caused a
chemical fire. Twelve people were injured.
   Two days later, CSX spokesman R. Lindsay Leckie said, the
brakeman admitted himself to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation
center.
   The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the
first car to derail was an oversized flatbed. Investigators also
discovered worn wheels and brakes and a variety of operating
violations.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of U.S. Rep. Mickey
Leland and the 15 others in his delegation were lifted off a
mountainside in southwestern Ethiopia today, officials said.
   ``We've got them all,'' Air Force Capt. Kevin Krejarck told
reporters in the capital upon his return from Gambela, a town near
the crash site. ``The site has now been cleared.''
   The bodies, lifted one by one from the wreckage by helicopters
hovering near the face of a sheer cliff, were flown to Gambela,
where they were placed aboard an Ethiopian air force C-130 cargo
plane for the return to the capital.
   U.S. Marine Lt. Col. David Titus said the bodies would be
identified in Addis Ababa by a team of U.S. forensic experts, a
process he said could take up to a week.
   Two C-130 Hercules cargo planes carrying rescue teams and fuel
left the capital shortly after dawn for Gambela, about 35 miles
southeast of the crash site, where joined two Blackhawk helicopters
in the operation, said U.S. Embassy spokesman James Haley.
   Heavy clouds, rain and low visibility were believed to have led
to the crash of the Twin Otter carrying Leland, eight other
Americans and seven Ethiopians to the Fugnido refugee camp in
southwestern Ethiopia on Aug. 7.
   Persistent bad weather also slowed the 6-day search as well as
the recovery effort after the twin-engine plane was found Sunday,
and the director of operations said the recovery operation could
take two more days.
   ``The recovery is proving to be extremely difficult because of
slippery rock, thick undergrowth and tall savannah grass,'' Air
Force Maj. Gen. James Record, of the U.S. Central Command, told a
news conference in Addis Ababa Monday night. ``The cliff inclines at
an 80 degree angle.''
   Gambela has served as the recovery coordination base since 12
bodies were found Sunday on the three-quarters the way up the slopes
of a 5,500-foot mountain where the Twin Otter crashed, about 350
miles southwest of Addis Ababa.
   Record said Ethiopia had accepted an offer from the U.S. National
Transportation and Safety Board to participate in an investigation
into the cause of the crash.
   He said a team of experts already was on its way to Ethiopia,
including representatives of the Boeing and Pratt and Whitney
aircraft companies, which manufactured the plane's body and engine.
The aircraft, which carries up to 20 passengers, was built by the
Canadian Boeing subsidiary de Havilland.
   A four-man congressional delegation also planned to fly to
Ethiopia to escort the bodies home but officials have said they will
not leave Washington until the bodies have been identified.
   Leland, 44, was on his fifth visit to Africa and his second this
year when the accident occurred en route to the refugee camp, one of
four in southwestern Ethiopia run by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees that house more than 300,000 Sudanese fleeing war and
famine in their neighboring country.
   The six-term Texas Democrat was traveling to the camps in his
capacity as chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger.

<HEAD>President Won't Rule Out Abducting Panamanian Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today refused to rule out
abducting Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to bring him
to trial on drug-trafficking charges, say, ``I have an obligation to
try to bring people to justice.''
   The president also said at a news conference that he has told
Guillermo Endara, who was widely considered the victor in Panama's
May 7 presidential election that ``We will continue to support what
the people of Panama voted for.''
   A senior State Department official said that Bush's vow of
support for Endara did not put the administration at odds with an
Organization of American States agreement to promote new elections
Sept. 1, conditioned on a transfer of power from Noriega's regime to
a transitional government.
   The United States supports that plan, although it continues to
believe that Endara fairly won the election, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The president was asked about comments he made in a recent Hearst
Newspapers interview in which he seemed to indicate in answer to a
question that kidnapping would be an acceptable option to bring
Noriega to this country to face a federal indictments in Florida.
   Asked today if kidnapping would be appropriate, Bush said:
   ``We have an indictment out against General Noriega for drug
trafficking. I'm told that it's a good indictment ... I'm not saying
what I would do or wouldn't do ... I have an obligation to try to
bring people to justice.''
   Mediation efforts by the OAS and economic and diplomatic
sanctions against Panama by the United States have failed to get
Noriega to give up power. There are no indications he will step down
as Panama's de facto ruler in the face of the OAS call for a
peaceful transfer of power next month.
   ``I'm not holding my breath on his voluntary departure,'' the
president told reporters.
   Asked what the administration plans are with regard to Panama, he
said, ``I don't know for sure what we are going to do.''
   Noriega unilaterally invalidated the May election, after
initially claiming it was won by his handpicked presidential
candidate.
   Various independent international and U.S. observer groups said
Endara won the election by as much as a 3-1 margin despite
widespread fraud allegedly engineered by Noriega's forces.
   Bush said he had recently told Endara, ``who was duly elected by
the people of Panama, that we will continue to support what the
people of Panama voted for.''

   A. Well, that _ if their justice system goes forward and there is

didn't try to see him brought to trial.
   Q. Well, sir, can't you take the lead in that and encourage the

   Q. Mr. President _
   A. We've got to get to the back of the room here.
   We're _ yeah?
   Q. Can you explain why you have not retaliated for the murder of
Colonel Higgins?
   A. Retaliated for his murder?
   Q. Yes, sir.
   A. If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, private
sector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostages
out or guard against future hostage taking, I would take such action.
   Military action _ I'd like to know that what action we took was
not going to victimize a lot of innocent people.
   And I'd like to be sure of all the facts before taking action on
the Higgins case.
   And I wish I could tell you we had all the facts, and we don't.

   I also must _ would have to weigh, if we considered military
action, the lives of the Americans that were being asked to carry
out that action.
   So, it's just not clear yet, but if I could find a way to take
those hostages, get them and bring them out, and that required using
the military force of the United States, make no mistake about it, I
would do it in an instant.
   Yeah? Right in the back. You have a follow-up?
   Q. Yes. May I ask what you're doing to increase the intelligence
that would let you do something like that? Have you ordered the CIA
to try to get assets in Lebanon?
   A. Well, the problem there is it takes a long time.
   And I do think that the period that we went through quite a few
years ago has resulted in less human intelligence than is necessary
to come to grips with something as murky as hostage-holding.
   And so I'd like to do more, and the various agencies know of my
interest in this, but I don't want to hold out the wrong kind of
hope that you can say, ``let's get more agents, more intelligence of
the human source'' and that that happens overnight.
   It just doesn't work that way.
   Yeah, way in the middle in the back, yes?

   Three teen-agers who collapsed and
died while exploring an abandoned coal mine apparently were felled
by suffocating gas so dangerous that ``all it takes is one breath''
to disable, a mine expert says.
   A fourth member of the group was in serious condition, suffering
from oxygen deprivation.
   Blackdamp, a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen feared by
miners, was detected in the mine Monday, said Jim Diamanti, a mine
manager who helped recover the bodies.
   ``All it takes is one breath of it and you're literally knocked
down and you can't function. If somebody doesn't pull you out,
you're dead,'' Diamanti said.
   ``Your body quits working. Your mind doesn't, but your body
immediately quits working and you can't move.''
   Killed on Sunday were Christian Rossman, 15; Catherine
Schrettner, 16, and Greg Folchert, 17. Autopsies were planned. Frank
Warner, 16, was in serious condition at St. Mary's Hospital after
being pulled from the cave.
   Sheriff's Lt. Wayne Harms said the teen-agers, along with two
others _ Miles Slape, 17, and Abby Roberts, 16 _ drove to the mine
Sunday night. Slape told authorities he entered the mine first but
came out when he had trouble breathing.
   ``The others didn't believe him so they went inside and they
never came out,'' Harms said.
   Slape and Roberts heard their friends choking and tried
unsuccessfully to re-enter the mine. Neither had keys to the two
cars they had driven, so they ran and walked five miles through the
desert to a motel to call for help.
   Rescuers found the bodies about 400 feet inside the cave, just
beyond a pile of rubble they suspect kept the blackdamp inside the
cave.
   They theorized that Warner, who was found atop the rubble, was
high enough to avoid the low-lying layer of blackdamp.

   President Bush paid tribute today to two House
members killed in recent plane crashes, calling them ``outstanding
public servants'' who were ``working to better the lot of mankind.''
   Bush opened a question-and-answer session with White House
reporters by recalling the deaths in Ethiopia of veteran Rep. Mickey
Leland, D-Texas, and in Mississippi of freshman Rep. Larkin Smith,
R-Miss.
   ``I want to note again the passing of two outstanding public
servants ..., the president said. ``... Their passing is mourned by
everyone who knew them.
   ``... Their death also reminds us that there are outstanding men
and women in public life who are working to better the lot of
mankind,'' Bush said, alluding to Leland's interest in alleviating
world hunger and Smith's concern with the war on drugs and crime.
   Meantime today, the bodies of Leland and the 15 others in his
delegation were lifted off the mountainside crash site in
southwestern Ethiopia, officials said.
   The bodies, lifted one by one from the wreckage by helicopters
hovering near the face of a sheer cliff, were flown to Gambela,
where they were placed aboard an Ethiopian air force C-130 cargo
plane for the return to Addas Ababa for identification procedures
that could take up to a week.
   Leland was memorialized at a special service Monday, one day
after searchers found the wreckage of his plane in a remote mountain
ravine 100 miles from its destination near Ethiopia's border with
Sudan.
   Meanwhile, a delegation of U.S. and Canadian aviation safety
experts left Washington on Monday for Ethiopia to help investigate
the cause of the crash. The Ethiopian government had requested the
aid.
   Plans for a delegation of four members of Congress and two White
House aides to travel to Ethiopia to accompany the American bodies
back to the United States were on hold until the bodies were
retrieved and identified.
   Leland, a 44-year-old Texas Democrat who headed the House Select
Committee on Hunger, was on his sixth visit to Africa and his second
this year when the plane crashed on Aug. 7.
   ``This mission was a mission of mercy. It was the best our
country had to offer. It showed our compassion, our generosity, our
interest in seeing that there are no more hungry people, the
children would not die of hunger. So why these?'' said Robert
Mallett, an aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said at the
memorial service.
   Mallett and other congressional staff members praised Leland and
the Capitol Hill aides who were among those accompanying him.
   Sponsored by the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus, the
service in the stately caucus room of the Russell Senate Office
Building mourned Leland; Patrice Y. Johnson, Leland's chief of
staff; Joyce Williams, a staff member for Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., for 10 years; and Hugh A. Johnson Jr., a staff member of
the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   ``We ask God, why these? They're our best,'' Mallett said. ``Your
living will not be in vain. Because we're going to see that
homelessness is no more. That ... in the words of the old Negro
spiritual, `we ain't going to study war no more.' We're going to see
that there are no more hungry children in Ethiopia, anywhere in the
world.
   ``In that way, we will know that in your dying, you have
challenged us to live,'' Mallett said.
   ``We gather today with heavy hearts as we join with his staff,
his family, and Senate staff in this great, immeasurable loss,''
prayed Senate Chaplain Richard C. Halverson. ``We remember the
hungry and the homeless for whom he laid down his life.''
   Leland, the founder of the hunger committee, was leading a
16-member delegation of Americans and Ethiopians to the refugee camp
when the twin-engine plane vanished shortly after takeoff from Addis
Ababa. There were no survivors.
   The trip was intended to focus attention on the need for hunger
relief for hundreds of thousands of Sudanese, who have been forced
from their homes by the country's long-running civil war.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters, ``There
will be a determination on the part members of the House to work for
those goals that Mickey Leland sought to achieve, the alleviation of
hunger and suffering here and in Africa and elsewhere in the world.''
   Foley said Leland's willingness to return to Africa was a
``testament to his determination individually to follow through on
commitments and values that were very, very close to him.
   ``And I think other members will also be willing to assume those
risks and I don't think this will change,'' said Foley.
   Letters, telegrams and phone calls of condolence poured in to
Leland's office Monday, as staff members from other congressional
offices pitched in to help.
   Private companies sent food and ``concerned people'' stopped by
to bring cookies, said Clara Pinzana, press secretary to Rep. Greg
Laughlin, D-Texas.
   In Dallas, about 500 mourners gathered at the Peoples Missionary
Baptist Church for a memorial service sponsored by the
Interdenominational Ministers Alliance of Dallas.
   The Rev. S.M. Wright, president of the alliance, said Leland had
worked closely with many political and religious leaders in Dallas,
trying to solve statewide problems.

<HEAD>South Korean Student Arrested After Return From North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South Korean student called ``the
flower of unification'' by supporters returned home Tuesday from
communist North Korea, clutching the hand of a clergyman who came to
escort her. Both were arrested.
   Im Su-kyong, 20, went to North Korea six weeks ago as a symbol of
the peninsula's reunification and had been told she would be
arrested for violating a law against visiting an enemy country.
   Tears streamed down Miss Im's face Tuesday as she addressed a
small crowd a few yards from from the demarcation line in the
Panmunjom truce zone. She said she was prepared for arrest.
   A South Korean soldier using a megaphone told her and the Rev.
Moon Gyu-hyon, a Roman Catholic priest studying in the United
States, to halt as they stepped over the raised cement line that
bisects the oval-shaped Panmunjom area.
   Miss Im dropped a bouquet of flowers she was carrying and grabbed
Moon's hand as they walked toward two South Korean border guards.
   The radical student left Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in
a motorcade Monday, seen off by thousands of screaming people waving
flowers.
   On Tuesday, what appeared to be much of the population of Kaesong
City, just outside the Demilitarized Zone, repeated the scene as her
open limousine pulled away from a guesthouse and headed for the
crossing. A loudspeaker van followed, blaring Miss Im's words of
farewell.
   Just before crossing the line, she told the crowd:
   ``Reunification of our motherland will come in the near future if
all Korean students North and South struggle together. If there are
forces that stand in my way, I will tell them of your sincere and
peaceful desire for reunification.''
   ``When our country is reunited, we will meet again!'' Miss Im
shouted.
   A North Korean army officer, Lt. Col. Yun Kiun, said, ``She is
brave.''
   She, Moon and officials of North Korea's Peaceful Reunification
Comittee then linked arms and sang ``Our Wish Is Reunification,''
swaying from side to side.
   Several Westerners in the northern sector of Panmunjom were seen
holding large placards that read ``Korea is one.''
   Officials in South Korea said Miss Im and Moon were the first
people to cross the border against the wishes of either government
since the Korean war ended in 1953.
   South Korea had said repeatedly that the crossing would violate
the Korean Armistice Agreement. Officials of the U.S.-led United
Nations Command, a signatory to the armistice, said they would file
a formal protest with North Korea of the violation.
   The U.N. Command, consisting of the United States and 15 other
nations that supported South Korea in the 1950-53 war, has
jurisdiction over the southern half of the Panmunjom truce area 35
miles north of Seoul.
   North Korean reports quoted Maj. Gen. Choi Ui Ung, chief delegate
to the Armistice Commission, as saying: ``Allowing them to go to the
South through Panmunjom is in full accord with the armistice
agreement and the spirit of humanitarianism.''
   Miss Im, who studies French at Hankook University in Seoul,
entered North Korea on June 30 to attend the World Festival of Youth
and Students in Pyongyang.
   Her original plan was to return July 27, but she stopped short of
the demarcation line when Seoul refused permission, and went on a
hunger strike for five days. North Korean officals said she became
ill during the fast and had only recently been released from a
hospital.
   Moon visited North Korea in June and returned there after a trip
to the United States, where he studies with the Maryknoll Order in
New York state.
   After their arrests, Miss Im and Moon were were flown to Seoul by
helicopter and she was given a medical checkup before being turned
over to the national intelligence agency, South Korean officials
said.
   They said the priest was questioned about his trip and about
anti-South Korea statements he allegedly made while in North Korea.
   If the two are convicted under the national security laws, they
could receive prison sentences of up to 10 years, legal experts said.
   In a speech in Seoul marking both Korea's liberation from
Japanese rule and its division in 1945, President Roh Tae-woo said
the Koreas should ``recognize each other, seek coexistence and
coprosperity and restore and develop a single national community
through mutual opening-up, exchanges and cooperation.''
   Roh also cautioned North Korea against agitating radicals in the
South.
   ``North Korea must realize that the only thing they can gain by
agitating the extremists and radicals within our society and by
enticing a few of them to secretly visit Pyongyang is the abhorrence
of our people,'' he declared.
   Dialogue between the nations has been sporadic. Several meetings
were held during the past year, but negotiations bogged down after
the illegal trips to North Korea.

<TEXT>
   Scientists have concluded that a
kerosene-based chemical Exxon Corp. had concocted to remove oil from
Alaskan beaches doesn't work.
   A review committee determined that Corexit 9580MS generally is
harmless to marine life but is of little value in lifting oil from
rocky shorelines.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced
Monday the substance wouldn't be approved for use on crude oil
spilled when the Exxon Valdez ran onto a reef in Prince William
Sound March 24.
   The review committee, made up of representatives from state and
federal agencies involved in the cleanup, has looked at hundreds of
chemicals and cleanup techniques but so far hasn't found anything
better than the high-pressure washing that is becoming less
effective as the oil weathers and hardens.
   NOAA is on the committee, as is the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   With Exxon's self-imposed deadline of Sept. 15 for the end of
this year's cleanup rapidly approaching, Corexit 9580MS was one of
about a dozen chemicals that under went extensive study as
scientists sought a last-ditch solution.
   Environmentalists and state officials have been wary of the use
of chemical dispersants, fearing they would simply break up the oil
and distribute it through the water, where it would be more toxic
than on the beach.
   Corexit is one of a variety of dispersant chemicals Exxon makes.
The company tried a kerosene-based blend of the chemical that
scientists hoped would break oil free from rocks but wouldn't
dissolve it to the point it couldn't be picked up by skimmers.

   Q. Mr. President, you've told us you're going to expand vastly
the fight against drugs. Are you willing to raise taxes to pay for
that?
   A. We're not going to have to, but we are going to expand federal
expenditures.
   Q. Follow-up on that, Mr. President.
   A. Yeah.
   Q. If you're not going to raise revenues to fight the drug war,
where are you going to get this money? Can you tell us specifically _
   A. Stay tuned, and we will show you in September how we're going
to allocate the resources for this.
   Q. And do I understand that this money will have to come from
other federal programs now being funded? Can you tell us
specifically where this _
   A. Not yet.
   No, I can't tell you yet because the final decisions haven't been
made.
   But we will have to do some reallocation of resources, there's no
question about that.
   Q. Mr. President?
   Q. (Inaudible) _ Panama _
   A. Yeah?
   Q. _ Going back to Latin America for a minute. On Sept. 1,
there'll be an inauguration of the candidate that Noriega supported,
effectively institutionalizing what the U.S. considers a ``stolen''
election. What is the U.S. going to do now? Are we going to be
limited to these kind of skirmishes that we saw last week, these
arrests of one side or the other, or is there something else?
   A. I don't know for sure what we're going to do.
   Part of our understanding of the OAS agreement was that Noriega
would be _ would be out.
   And I'm not holding my breath on his _ his voluntary departure.
   But _ and I have told Mr. Endara, who was duly elected by the
people of Panama the other day, that we will continue to support
what the people of Panama voted for.
   But it's still rather murky as to what will happen beyond Sept. 1.
   There are some hints that possibly there will be a transfer.
   Let me just simply say this, I would reiterate that our argument
is not with the Panamanian defense forces, it is with Mr. Noriega
himself, and that if he were to go out, and that you had the will of
the people recognized, we would instantly have better relations with
Panama; it would be good for our country and certainly it would
improve life for the Panamanians.
   John, in the middle.
   Q. Mr. President, in the past you've said that the budget is very
tight, there's not much room at the federal level for spending. Now
you say that resources are going to be reallocated. Doesn't that
signal some hard times ahead for the military or the social programs
or both?

   Tens of thousands of traditionalist and right-wing
Roman Catholics marched through the streets Tuesday in ceremonies of
atonement for what they call the crimes of the French Revolution.
   The hymn-singing procession, with hundreds of colorful banners
bearing royal and Christian symbols, wound its way along a 2{-mile
route from the Louvre to the Opera and back via the stock market
district.
   Heading the procession was the Rev. Philippe Laguerie, leader of
fundamentalist Roman Catholics loyal to rebel Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre, who was excommunicated by Pope John Paul II for
consecrating bishops in his order without authorization.
   Organizers estimated about 30,000 people took part in the daylong
events, which began with a traditional Latin Mass in front of the
Louvre _ a former royal palace that is now a museum.
   The events were organized by religious fundamentalists and people
identified with extreme right-wing politics, two groups that overlap
in France.
   Jean-Claude Martinez, a leader of the extreme-right National
Front who served in Parliament from 1986-88, was among the
spectators. He described the participants as ``the right wing, the
hard core of our electorate. About 90 percent would be National
Front voters.''
   Authorities refused permission to hold the rally at the Place de
la Concorde, where King Louis XVI was beheaded, but Brigneau said
the square in front of the Louvre was just as appropriate.
   ``We are here in the heart of what was the Republic of fear, the
Republic of terror, the Republic of the revolution,'' he said,
noting that during the Terror, prisoners were taken from cells just
across the Seine in the Conciergerie in carts past the Louvre to the
guillotine.
   ``There were many innocents, priests, men of the people, children
who were killed,'' said Gabrielle Fath, who said she came from her
home in Montbronn in eastern France ``to atone for all the crimes
committed in the Revolution.''
   Gerard Champion, of Arras in northern France, said the official
bicentennial celebrations this year were ``grotesque. They showed
the desire of the authorities to continue to brainwash the people
into thinking the revolution was good.''
   Champion and Mrs. Fath said they were not necessarily advocating
a return to monarchy. ``I'm not against democracy as such, as long
as its founded on faith,'' Champion said.
   Mrs. Fath said she would prefer ``a just and pure king like St.
Louis,'' but could support a republican government ``if we had a
good Catholic president who outlawed abortion.''
   The day ended with an appeal to the Virgin Mary, asking her to
accept ``a public rehabilitation of France, which seems to have
abandoned its Christian vocation for the past 200 years.''
   The vow was a renewal of King Louis XIII's consecration of France
to Mary in 1638, which he ordered to be made every year on Aug. 15.
   ``We are ardent and convinced counterrevolutionaries,'' said
Francois Brigneau, an editorialist for the extreme-right weekly
National Hebdo, in a welcoming speech.
   Calling attention to a 13-foot replica of a guillotine on one
side of the square, Brigneau said it was symbolic of ``our hostility
to a bicentennial which insists on recounting a tragedy with
cheerful words, and on glorifying the executioners without a thought
to honoring the victims.''
   The procession marked the feast of the Assumption, when Roman
Catholics believe the Virgin Mary's body and soul were taken up into
heaven after her death.
   A simultaneous but smaller procession, also with a statue of
Mary, took place outside Notre Dame Cathedral a few blocks away
under the auspices of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Paris.

   A 12-year-old boy lost two front teeth but
was otherwise uninjured when a 14-year-old acquaintance shot him in
the mouth with a small-caliber pistol, police said.
   The unidentified 14-year-old boy was questioned Monday night and
later booked with attempted second-degree murder, police spokeswoman
Cindy Chadwick said Tuesday.
   Kunte Kinte Green said he was standing on a corner talking with
friends Monday night when the older boy pointed a gun at him and
pulled the trigger several times before it fired, according to
police.
   Authorities speculated the bullet was deflected by the boy's
teeth. He said the bullet did not hit his lip and he felt no pain.
He said he learned he had been shot when he began bleeding.
   ``He'll be all right,'' said Eddie McRaney, the boy's cousin.
``We're blessed that it wasn't any worse than it was.''

   The daughter, son and wife of a man
who was shot to death on the porch of his mobile home were charged
in the slaying, and authorities say the family had plotted his death
for at least a month.
   Investigators have refused to give a motive for the shooting of
Robert Dean ``Bobby'' Bell. But two daughters who aren't charged in
the case, ages 16 and 20, said that Bell had been violent and
abusive to his family for years.
   Bell's daughter, Patricia C. Hylton, 21, and son, Robert Dow
Bell, 22, were charged Monday with murder. They and their mother,
Penny Carr Bell, 43, were charged with solicitation and conspiracy
to commit murder.
   Bell was shot in the back of the neck with a rifle Friday.
   Authorities allege the Robert Dow Bell taught his sister, Ms.
Hylton, how to use the gun and that she fired the shot.
   An informant had told authorities that the defendants asked him
last month where they could get poison and that Penny Bell later
asked for help in finding someone to kill her husband, sheriff's Lt.
Gary Cuff testified Monday.
   Deputies then hid a microphone on another informant, and Cuff
said deputies listened as family members admitted to the murder
plot. Robert Dow Bell said that Patricia had ``the guts to do it''
and fired the shot, Cuff said.
   Ms. Hylton and her brother were jailed without bail. Bail for
Penny Bell was set at $400,000.

   A. Yes. We're in a period of hard times in the sense that we
don't have all the money that we would like to spend in several
areas.
   So, it isn't easy.
   And I'm determined, though, to get this federal budget deficit
down and to live within the Gramm-Rudman targets and to do it
without threatening this long expansion by raising taxes on the
American people.
   Owen?
   Q. Have you made no final decision on what programs are going to
get the pinch on _
   A. No, the OMB is working on that right now.
   Yes?
   Q. The last administration also made the fight against drugs a
major priority, and yet drug interdiction efforts have not slowed
the distribution of crack cocaine. People in this country still
think drug abuse is a very major problem. What can you do
differently now that you're president than the last administration
or even prior administrations to turn this problem around?
   A. Well, the drugs _ in the first place, we're formulating a
national drug strategy.
   And though we've approached _ in the previous administration we
approached various parts of it, this will be a rather comprehensive
national strategy.
   You point out the bad side of it, and it is horrible, no question.
   There is a little bit of good news out there, and that is the
decline _ a decline _ a serious decline in the amount of casual use
of cocaine has taken place.
   This encourages, because I think with better emphasis on
education, we can do more on the demand side.
   On the interdiction side, we are going to have some specifics in
that that I think will help get to the problem at the source.
   So, you learn.
   I salute the interdiction people who have done a good job, but
we're just trying to improve on it, make it better.
   Q. Mr. President?
   Q. Can I follow that _
   A. Yeah, here _
   Q. Can I follow that up?
   A. Yeah, Owen, please follow up there.
   Q. I know there's talk about using military assistance to provide
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to help cut down on drug trafficking. Can
you tell me if you would consider deploying U.S. troops in these
countries to help in that effort?
   A. Well, I have said previously, way back in the campaign, that I
would give serious consideration to an invitation from countries to
help them.
   And I'll tell you what I found at this G-7 meeting.
   It was a very interesting _ from several of the European leaders,
the feeling that maybe we ought to have some kind of international
effort to help countries in this regard, going after people where _
in a country, at the invitation of a government of a country, people
that have been out of the reach of the law enforcement _ of the
local _ of the local _ of the country itself _ of the government.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek End to Strike; Pravda Blasts `Nationalist Hysteria'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One week into Estonia's costly strikes, a panel of
legislators flew there Tuesday to hear out angry workers, and a
toughly worded Pravda article showed the Kremlin's growing
impatience over the walkouts.
   The Communist Party's top newspaper blasted ``nationalist
hysteria'' in the Baltic region and blamed a law passed by Estonia's
Supreme Soviet parliament for igniting labor unrest among ethnic
Russians and other non-Estonians in the republic.
   Izvestia, the Soviet government daily, reported that the workers'
protest, in its seventh day, has shut down another mine in Estonia,
and that railway employees walked off the job at a station at
Yulemiste.
   That means all rail freight stations around Tallinn, Estonia's
capital, have been paralyzed by the strike, with more than 3,000
rail cars standing idle, Izvestia said.
   To assure the flow of supplies to the city of 480,000 people,
goods are being shipped to other cities in Estonia, the paper quoted
the republic's deputy premier, P. Palu, as saying. ``That way, we'll
supply Tallinn with everything needed,'' he said.
   Maarika Saarna, an editor with Estonian state radio, said from
Tallinn that at last report, 26,000 workers at about 40 enterprises
in the republic of 1.5 million people were believed to be on strike.
   Mikhail Lysenko, a member of the strike committee, said by
telephone that ``thousands'' of ethnic Russians at some 50 factories
were staying off the job.
   The strike began one day after Estonia's lawmakers adopted a law
limiting voting to adults who have lived in the same district for
two years, or anywhere in Estonia for five years. Candidates for
elected office must live in the same place for five years, or in
Estonia for 10 years.
   State-run Radio Moscow said the law will take the right to vote
away from more than 100,000 recent non-Estonian arrivals _ the
precise goal pursued by the law's advocates, who fear an influx of
outsiders will make ethnic Estonians a minority in their own
homeland.
   In its tough commentary, Pravda aimed its criticism at the law
rather than the strikers, saying ``the passage of discriminatory
acts has an extremely destabilizing influence on the political
situation.'' In Estonia and its two Baltic neighbors, Latvia and
Lithuania, ``a situation is building up of nationalist hysteria,''
the paper said.
   On Monday, Estonia's Communist Party chief Vaino Vyalyas called
for ethnic Russians to negotiate their differences with the
republic's authorities and end the strike, which Radio Moscow said
has cost the Soviet economy millions of dollars.
   However, Vyalyas said in an Estonian TV interview that an initial
round of negotations with protesting workers Monday did not succeed
in resolving the strike, and called for more.
   He admitted the rights of Estonia's minorities had not been taken
into account, and added ``this is our mistake and it must be
rectified.'' Russians and other migrants make up about one-third of
Estonia's population.
   Ms. Saarna said two sets of negotiations were taking place
Tuesday in Tallinn, at the Estonian party's policy-making Central
Committee and with members of the Moscow-based Supreme Soviet
legislature's commission on interethnic relations, who flew to
Tallinn to try to calm tempers and end the strike.
   Ms. Saarna, an ethnic Estonian, defended the new election law
from criticisms published by Pravda and in other Moscow-based media.
``They forget every civilized country has a citizenship,'' she said.
``We are fighting for staying alive as a nation. They act as though
the poor Russians only had this place (Estonia) to live in.''
   In the Caucasus republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan _ two other
Soviet areas threatened by nationalist labor unrest _ officials said
all was quiet Tuesday.
   Georgian activists called off a strike they had considered for
Tuesday, according to Gruzinform, the official Georgian news agency.
An activist said the strike was postponed until Sept. 1 because the
government promised it will identify and take action against
instigators of violence in one district of the republic, Abkhazia,
by then.
   At least 20 people died in the violence last month. Finding and
punishing those responsible has been the Georgian activists' main
demand.
   In Azerbaijan, where six factories in the capital of Baku were
reported on strike Monday and 10,000 people demonstrated Monday
night, an Interior Ministry official said life was back to normal
Tuesday.

   Syrian troops pounded defense lines around
the country's besieged Christian enclave with artillery and tank
fire today in what police feared was a softening-up barrage before a
major ground offensive.
   Sixteen people were kiled and 86 wounded, police said.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in an
extraordinary move, today called an emergency meeting of the
Security Council to arrange a cease-fire. There was no immediate
word on when the council would convene.
   Police reported clashes between Syrian and Christian forces in
three provinces. Both sides battled with artillery in Beirut,
hitting residential neighborhoods in the eastern Christian and
western Moslem sectors.
   The latest casualties raised the toll in the fighting that broke
out March 8 to at least 757 dead and 2,036 wounded.
   The Syrians, outnumbering Christian forces by two-to-one, were
reported massing troops and Soviet-built T-72 tanks in the central
mountains that form the eastern flank of the beleaguered enclave.
   The action appeared to be seeking to stretch Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun's forces, who two days earlier repelled an attack
on a mountain outpost overlooking the capital.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio meanwhile reported Israeli
warplanes blasted targets shortly after noon today near the southern
port of Sidon, but police had no immediate confirmation.
   The Syrians have about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate and have sided with a Moslem government
that rivals the Christian government headed by Aoun, who commands
about 20,000 fighters.
   A police spokesman said fighting flared across Beirut's dividing
Green Line, in the mountains southeast of the capital and on the
northern flank of the Christian enclave.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said the Syrians ``want to shatter Aoun's forces and
weaken their supply lines. They want Aoun to fight a war on several
fronts at the same time.''
   The Syrian moves were ``an apparent preparation for a new attack
on Aoun's defenses'' following an abortive attempt to storm the
Christians' strategic Souk el-Gharb strongpoint, 15 miles southeast
of Beirut two days ago, he said.
   The mountaintop outpost, besieged by Moslem forces since 1983,
controls a network of roads twisting through the mountains into the
Christian heartland north of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners in Moslem west Beirut, the Chouf mountains
southeast of the capital and in Syrian-controlled north Lebanon
hammered Aoun's defenses with 130mm howitzers and tanks.
   Police said shells were falling on Christian positions at a rate
of five a minute.
   Two unidentified warplanes flew over the Christian perimeter at
high altitude, releasing scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking
missiles. But they drew no fire.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Christian artillery were targeting Syrian troop
concentrations in the central mountains and the Druse Moslem
villages facing Souk el-Gharb.
   Aoun's forces were ``determined to foil all attempts to storm
through our lines, even before they launch an attack,'' the
spokesman said.
   In Washington, the U.S. State Department criticized Syria and its
allies for the continued warfare in Lebanon and said the bloodshed
makes U.S. efforts to gain the release of American hostages held by
Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems there more difficult.
   In Kuwait, Syrian Defense Minister Gen. Mustafa Tlass was quoted
by the Al-Watan daily as saying Damascus will supply its Moslem
allies with all the weapons, including surface-to-surface missiles,
they need to defeat Aoun's troops and right-wing militia allies.
   Syrian and Christian gunners shelled residential districts of
Beirut intermittently through the morning, bringing to a standstill
what little life there was left in the devastated capital.
   An estimated 90 percent of the city's population of 1.5 million
has fled the last few weeks, leaving only about 150,000 people
huddled in underground shelters.
   A few bakeries that have not been hit or closed down were open,
but few civilians risked being caught in the open to line up for
bread.
   ``There are only a few people still in Beirut anyway,'' said
Hassan Zebib at the sandbagged entrance of his west Beirut bakery.
   ``We only allow five people to wait for bread at the entrance. We
don't want a large crowd to avoid casualties in case we're
shelled,'' he added.
   The Telecommunications Ministry appealed for its technicians to
``report to duty immediately to repair telephone and telex lines
that suffered severe damage during the shelling.''
   The current round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
broke out when Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed
militias south of Beirut.
   His attempt to restore long-eroded government authority over the
militias, whose ports siphoned an estimated $100 million a year in
customs levies from the state treasury, triggered retaliatory
shelling by the Syrians and their allies.

   A shower of rocks in a gold
mine west of Johannesburg killed 11 miners and left three missing,
authorities said Tuesday.
   Six men also suffered injuries at the West Driefontein mine
Monday in a ``pressure burst'' _ an accident caused when a buildup
of underground pressure erupts through the face of a mine shaft or
tunnel, according to Gold Fields of South Africa, owner of the
facility.
   The accident occurred at nearly 7,600 feet underground.
   The company said efforts to find the missing miners were
continuing.
   South Africa has many of the deepest gold mines in the world and
hundreds of miners are killed in underground accidents each year.

   Seven thousand relatives of war victims paused for a
minute of silence Tuesday on the anniversary of World War II's end,
and Emperor Akihito prayed for world peace.
   At least 10 members of the Cabinet of new Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu marked the day by making visiting the Shinto shrine for 2.4
million of Japan's 3.1 million war dead _ including 14 convicted war
criminals.
   Kaifu himself did not visit the Yasukuni Shrine. Opposition
political parties and other groups in Japan say such visits violate
the constitutional separation of religion and state and promote
militarism.
   Akihito, attending a ceremony at a martial arts hall near the
Imperial Palace, stood before 25,000 white and yellow chrysanthemums
and bowed deeply, with Empress Michiko at his side.
   ``Looking back, it has already been 44 years since the end of the
war, and in the midst of the peace and prosperity of today brought
about by the untiring hard work of the people, when I recall the
times replete with hardship, my mind is filled with a thousand
emotions,'' Akihito said.
   ``On the occasion of this day, in remembrance of the war victims,
I think of the many people who lost their lives and of their
families, and I am deeply saddened,'' he told relatives of war
victims.
   ``I pray, along with all our people, for the future development
of our country and for world peace,'' he said.
   The late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, announced to the
nation on Aug. 15, 1945, that Japan would surrender to the allies.
   Akihito led Tuesday's ceremony in a minute of silence at noon,
the exact moment that Hirohito's voice was broadcast.
   About 90 members of Parliament from the governing Liberal
Democratic Party also visited the Yasukuni Shrine, Kyodo News
Service reported.
   Last year, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita did not visit Yasukuni
on the war anniversary. His predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, visited
the shrine in 1985 but later discontinued the visits because of
strong opposition from China and other neighboring nations.
   The Chinese and other nations in the region are wary of any signs
of growing Japanese militarism. In a prewar conquest, Japan seized
Manchuria from China in 1931.
   In his statement marking Tuesday's anniversary, Kaifu said,
``Those who did not return did not die in vain, as we take the
lessons of the war closely to heart and pledge to work for world
peace and the prosperity and harmony of our country in international
society.''

   So, we have no specifics on that at this point.
   But generally speaking, we have used military assets, as you know.
   We've used helicopters, for example, in, I believe it was Bolivia
and perhaps Peru.
   And we're _ we're _ we're interested in all of this, but I don't
think you can inflict force on a country, and I wouldn't _ I
wouldn't want to be a part of that at all.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. Mr. President, you talked about conflicting signals coming out
of Iran as a result of your diplomatic efforts _
   A. Well, I'm not sure it's a result of it, but there are
conflicting signals coming out of Iran.
   Q. Coincident with _
   A. OK.
   Q. _ your diplomatic efforts. I'd like to ask, do you believe
that President Rafsanjani is firmly in charge in Iran? How long are
you prepared to give this diplomatic process before trying some
other means or effort?
   A. Well, please elaborate.
   What do you mean, ``before trying some other means''? I'm not
sure _
   Q. Well, there are those _ there are those who believe that there
should be stronger military messages _
   A. Yeah.
   Q. _ sent.
   A. I don't know the answer to your first part of it, and I don't
know any expert in this government that does.
   I had a meeting with various agency experts on Iran, and I think
the jury is still out as to the _ what has happened internally there
in Iran.
   I think all our experts feel that there are some hopeful signs,
and I would cite some of the comments by Mr. Rafsanjani.
   And then, you've seen some countersigns, one as recently as
yesterday by Mr. Khamenei.
   And there are others _ their interior minister who seems to be
very hard over.
   So, I think we don't know yet _ we don't know how it is sorting
out.
   But again, I would go back to the earlier answer, that that's
fine, that can move forward.
   But if I find some other channel or action that would get our
hostages out of there, I wouldn't wait on sorting out the internal
affairs of Iran.
   Yeah?
   Q. If I can follow, though, just how long are you prepared to
wait? And would you consider stepping up military pressure in this
process? And to what extent do you hold Iran responsible for the
safety of these hostages?
   A. Well, again, we're trying to sort out _ there certainly _ I
think that if Iran decided they wanted those hostages to come out of
there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen _
perhaps not with certainty, but a good likelihood.

<HEAD>Ex-Congressman Launches Bid For Texas Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Kent Hance, a one-time Democrat
who beat President Bush's son for Congress in 1978, today launched a
bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
   Hance cited his experience as a state senator, congressman and
railroad commissioner. ``I am the one candidate who does not need
on-the-job training. As your governor, I will lead from day one,''
he said.
   Hance's Republican rivals include Midland oilman Clayton Williams
and former Secretary of State Jack Rains of Houston.
   On the Democratic side, state Treasurer Ann Richards is the only
announced candidate, although Attorney General Jim Mattox is raising
money for the race, and former Gov. Mark White also is considering a
comeback.
   Hance entered Congress by defeating George W. Bush and in 1981
was one of the ``Boll Weevil'' Democrats who backed President
Reagan's income-tax cut.
   After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate nomination in 1984,
Hance became a Republican. He unsuccessfully sought the GOP
gubernatorial nomination in 1986.
   Hance promised to seek a constitutional ban on state income
taxes, increased local control over schools and tougher penalties
for drug dealers. He also expressed a strong anti-abortion stance.
   Gov. Bill Clements, who has served two, non-consecutive four-year
terms, has said he will not seek re-election.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Elderly Can Have More Control Over Memory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older people who accept the stereotype
that they're supposed to be forgetful are more likely to be so, a
researcher says.
   ``A younger person is likely to attribute memory problems to
inattention or a task being difficult, while an elderly person often
says, `Well, I had trouble with that because I'm old,''' said Robin
West, a University of Florida psychology professor and author of the
book ``Memory Fitness Over 40.''
   In a new study, Ms. West hopes that combining memory-improving
techniques with a different set of beliefs about aging will bring
long-term changes.
   ``We're not going to try to convince people that aging doesn't
change memory _ it does,'' she said Monday.
   ``If older adults avoid memory tasks, they're likely to lose
these skills because their lifestyles often are less demanding than
those of younger people,'' Ms. West said. ``Their boss isn't asking
them to do a complex job and they aren't supervising their
children's activities.''
   The first memory skill people are likely to lose as they get
older is mental speed. Other early problems are difficulty
concentrating and retrieving information, such as feeling someone's
name is on the tip-of-the-tongue, she said.
   Imagery is one technique Ms. West suggests to improve memory.
Grocery lists can be memorized, for example, by matching pictures of
food with each item on the list and mentally linking the pictures,
she said.
   ``Older adults have as many stereotypes about aging and memory as
young people do,'' she said. ``Many believe that age brings memory
decline and that it is more pervasive and serious than it often is.''

   And so, as you know, the position of the United States government
has been that Iran and a couple of other states have been involved
in the state sponsorship of terrorism.
   And so, I don't think it's a question of how long, it's a
question of not _ in my view, it's a question of exploring every
avenue to get these people back and recognizing that at some point
we have to stand up for our interests even if it means military.
   And yet, I'm not threatening military action because I've told
you some of the constraints on authorizing military action.
   Q. Your budget director said over the weekend that the Fed ought
to be a little bit less concerned about inflation and more concerned
about recession and perhaps let loose on interest rates. Do you
agree with that?
   A. Listen, I don't know of any president, now or in the past, who
doesn't favor lower interest rates.
   That is _ that's the American way.
   But you also have to be concerned about inflationary pressures.
   I thought what Dick Darman said was very balanced and very _ I
can feel very comfortable with his sallying forth and saying that.
   And I think I've said essentially the same thing in the past.
   Q. Mr. President?
   Q. Mr. Darman also suggested that the Fed might be responsible
for any recession down the road if interest rates don't come down.
Do you agree with that, sir?
   A. Well, I'd like to go back, because I don't recall that part of
it, and take that under advisement and let you know at a later date.
(Laughter.)
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, are you _ what is the United States doing, if
anything, to try and stop the destruction of Beirut that's under
way? Is this _ is it a fear that if the Syrians succeed in driving
the Christians out, that would seriously set back any progress
that's been made on settling the West Bank and Gaza problem?
   A. The answer to your last question is yes, and the answer to the
first part is joining others in calling for a cease-fire and the
withdrawal of all foreign forces; support for the Arab League
mission, which regrettably has hit an impasse right now, but
encouraging those three countries involved to re-energize that
initiative; joining, where we can _ I had a long talk with the
secretary general to see what role the United Nations can play.
   And indeed, I might take this opportunity to thank him for his
timely dispatch of his emissary to the Middle East _ although that
wasn't a mission about Lebanon, it had to do with Colonel Higgins.
   I was deeply appreciative of his taking that action.
   So, we are in a very complicated situation in the Lebanon, where
I am not sure any outside power can do other than exort people in
the country to have the cease-fire, and to withdraw foreign forces,
and then to take a look at whatever constitutional change is
necessary so you have a representation there that all factions in
Lebanon can feel comfortable with.
   And it's a long process.
   And in the meantime, I am literally heartbroken _ I have bored
some of you with this, but I have been to the Lebanon when I was in
business, and I recall it as the peaceful oasis in a then-troubled
Middle East.
   And I saw Christians living peacefully with the Muslims, and some
day, again, I would like to think that the Lebanon can be restored
to that.

   A federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent was
arrested in a sting by his own agency after delivering 62 pounds of
cocaine to informants at Logan International Airport, authorities
said today.
   Edward K. O'Brien, 44, headed the DEA's Springfield office from
1982 to 1988 and works at DEA headquarters in Arlington, Va.,
helping set up a DEA museum, said agency spokesman George Festa.
   O'Brien, who lives in Fairfax County, Va., was arrested Monday.
Officials said drug charges would be filed today.
   Investigators said O'Brien had received the drugs in Miami
earlier Monday from a DEA informant. O'Brien was paid $14,000 to
transport the drug and was expecting another $14,000 on delivery in
Boston, officials said.
   O'Brien was placed on leave.
   DEA spokeswoman Kathi Sullivan refused to elaborate on how the
sting worked.
   Also arrested in the case were O'Brien's brothers, Paul, 34, and
John, 39, both from Cape Cod, the DEA said. They were accused of
taking part in the deal
   The DEA alleged that this was the second such delivery. On July
27, while under surveillance, O'Brien picked up 55 pounds of sham
cocaine in Miami and brought it to Boston, receiving $25,000 from
informants, officials said.

<HEAD>Soviet Cosmonauts Will Return to Space Station Next Month</HEAD>

   Two cosmonauts will reactivate the Mir
space station in September after four months in mothballs, and
they'll try out a new ``space motorcycle'' and shower, and install a
docking port for the Soviet space shuttle, officials said Tuesday.
   Alexander S. Viktorenko, the flight commander, and Alexander A.
Serebrov, the flight engineer, are to blast off Sept. 6 to resume
the Soviet manned space program that was put on hold because of
tight finances and technical delays.
   Among the highlights of the six-month mission will be a ride
outside Mir in a ``space motorcycle.'' Alexander N. Balandin, a
backup engineer for the flight, said the motorcycle is similar to
the manned maneuvering unit used by U.S. space shuttle astronauts.
   It can travel up to 50 yards away from Mir for 2-3 hours at a
time, he told a news conference at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training
Center in Star City, about 25 miles east of Moscow.
   Soviet officials have said cosmonauts will use the craft to
inspect Mir's exterior, repair satellites and as a rescue vehicle.
   Mir, the showcase of the Soviet space program launched in
February 1986, was designed to be manned permanently but was
unexpectedly vacated April 27, when three cosmonauts returned to
Earth.
   Officials have said the Mir was mothballed to save money and
because two new modules _ including one containing the motorcycle _
were not ready.
   The Soviet space program has come under fire for lavish spending
at a time when the country is suffering a $192 billion budget
deficit and chronic shortages of consumer goods and food. Serebrov
said the lapse in the program saved an estimated $32 million,
including the cost of a supply ship that would have been needed as
well as a crew transport capsule and rocket booster.
   ``Unfortunately, the calculations are such now that when a
cosmonaut doesn't fly, we economize and it's advantageous. We're
working toward a situation where a cosmonaut flies and there will be
only profit,'' said Anatoly Y. Solovyev, another backup cosmonaut
for the mission.
   A 20-ton module containing the cycle, a new space shower and
wider, more comfortable airlock for space walks will be launched in
October and attached to Mir, Serebrov said. The cosmonauts plan to
try out the new cycle at some point during the mission while wearing
a new, more flexible spacesuit.
   Alexei A. Leonov, the training center's deputy director and a
former cosmonaut, said he had worked with Soviet engineers to
develop a space motorcycle in the early 1970s but the project was
canceled ``because some wise guy said it wasn't needed.''
   A second module with a special docking port to receive the new
Soviet shuttle Buran and equipment to grow crystals for electronics
in the weightlessness of space is to be launched in February,
Serebrov said.
   Buran, a carbon copy of the U.S. shuttle, flew for the first time
in November without a crew. Leonov said the shuttle won't fly again
until 1991 at the earliest, and then will be launched without a crew
to link up with Mir using the new docking port. It could return to
Earth carrying cosmonauts, Leonov said.
   The 20-ton Mir already has one module attached to it, a space
observation laboratory called Kvant. Mir has docking ports for three
more modules.
   Serebrov, a veteran of two flights, and Viktorenko, who flew once
before, are to blast off at night aboard a Soyuz rocket from the
Baikonur space center in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan,
Leonov said.
   Balandin and Solovyov are to join the two aboard Mir in early
March and work with them for a week, said Viktorenko, 43. He said he
and Serebrov, 45, will then return to Earth.
   Mir has been manned for 880 days since its launch, with four
resident crews. Cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov broke
space endurance records by staying aboard for one year.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Says Iran Has Nothing to Do With Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS FARES</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's foreign minister repeated his
nation's frequent denial of any link with hostages in Lebanon, but
he also indicated Tuesday that talks might follow if Israel frees a
kidnapped Shiite Moslem cleric.
   President Bush adopted a conciliatory tone, saying in Washington
the Iranians have it in their power to get American hostages
released and rejoin the ``family of law abiding'' nations.
   Sixteen Westerners are missing in Lebanon, including eight
Americans, and most are believed held by Shiite groups loyal to Iran.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, thought to be among
the ``pragmatists'' led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said talks
with the Syrians ``will not have anything to do with the hostage
issue since this issue does not concern us.'' He spoke to reporters
after meeting with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
   Official media in Damascus indicated, however, that President
Hafez Assad and other Syrian leaders were pressing the Iranians for
action on the hostages. Syria was Iran's main Arab ally in its
eight-year war with Iraq, in which a truce was reached a year ago.
   Velayati said Israel must free the pro-Iranian cleric, Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, without conditions.
   Israel kidnapped Obeid from south Lebanon on July 28. It has
offered to trade him and hundreds of other Lebanese Shiite prisoners
for three Israeli soldiers held captive in Lebanon and the Western
hostages.
   Bush said in Washington: ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran
for the rest of our lives. We've had a good relationship with them
in the past. They're of strategic importance. They'd be welcome back
into the family of law-abiding, non-terrorist-sponsoring nations.''
   He said the best signal Iran could give the United States of its
intention to improve relations would be to bring about the release
of the Americans.
   ``I think that if Iran decided they wanted those hostages to come
out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would
happen,'' Bush said.
   In another apparent signal to Tehran, the United States told the
World Court it would be willing to participate in a suit brought by
Iran over the shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in July
1988 by a U.S. Navy ship in the Persian Gulf.
   Velayati, who arrived Monday for talks on the fighting between
Syrians and Chrstians in Lebanon, said: ``We hope Sheik Obeid will
be released. This release should take place without any prior
conditions _ no talks, no discussions before Sheik Obeid is
released.''
   Syria has been instrumental in past hostage releases and has
promised Washington to help resolve the crisis surrounding Obeid's
abduction.
   After talks with the foreign minister, Velayati met with Assad
and delivered a letter from Rafsanjani, who has indicated
flexibility on the hostage issue since his inauguration the day
Obeid was kidnapped. The contents were not disclosed.
   Accompanying Velayati to Damascus was one of his deputies,
Hussein Sheikholeslam, a hard-liner with close links to Hezbollah,
or Party of God, the group thought to sponsor Shiite kidnap gangs in
Lebanon.
   Sheikholeslam was a leader of Iranian militants who stormed the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held 52 Amricans hostage
for 444 days.
   Velayati also met in Damascus with Hezbollah leaders, including
Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, the movement's spiritual adviser.
Fadlallah said Friday that all hostages should be freed.
   Britain asked Iran to release businessman Roger Cooper after
nearly four years of detention so he can attend his mother's funeral
Saturday. Cooper, 53, was detained in November 1985 for overstaying
his visa and later was accused of spying, but no charges have been
filed. His mother died Aug. 3.
   Tehran newspapers denounced the United States on Tuesday.
   Kayhan International, an English-language daily, said for Bush to
``pin hopes on Iran's assistance'' to free the hostages ``without
respecting Tehran's conditions is wishful thinking.''
   It said Iran rejects indirect talks through Pakistan, an Islamic
neighbor with which Tehran is forging new links, because of
Washington's ``insolent tone.''
   Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan of Pakistan was scheduled
to arrive in Tehran on Wednesday for a three-day visit.
   Kayhan said the release of billions of dollars in Iranian assets
the United States froze in 1979 would ``be taken only as a goodwill
gesture,'' not as an trade-off for help in freeing the hostages.
   Abrar, a radical daily, said: ``The return of Iranian assets and
properties is the indisputable and lawful right of the Islamic
republic and is not something to be bargained over.''
   Last week, the English-language Tehran Times said Iran would be
willing to help free the hostages if the assets were released.

   The money was gone, but the workers figured
Alice Wilson would still like to have back the purse they found
behind an old department store cabinet. They were right. Found
nearly two decades after it was stolen, it was like her own personal
time capsule.
   There were pictures, an address book, old telephone numbers,
memories.
   The construction workers who found it _ Chuck Williams and Tracy
Johnston _ eventually found Ms. Wilson, using the phone numbers.
   To ensure that they would recognize her, they studied her
photograph.
   ``They were surprised ... they said you sure look different,''
said Ms. Wilson, whose permed dark hair has replaced the large Afro
she once wore. ``They said I looked much better.''
   ``It was my favorite purse at the time because it was given to me
for my birthday,'' Ms. Wilson, now 39, said Tuesday. ``Never in a
million years did I think I would get that purse back.''
   Inside was her learner's permit for driving. There were photos of
her high school sweetheart, her girlfriends from high school. There
was her then-new Social Security card. And her then-new voter
registration card, along with gold-colored lipstick and makeup.
   There was a photo of her mother smoking a cigarette. Ms. Wilson
happily said her mom has since given up the habit.
   Then there was a photo of herself as a much younger woman,
wearing red bellbottom pants, a halter top and platform shoes. In
another she wore a mini dress.
   ``It brought back memories,'' said Ms. Wilson, of Forestville,
Md., who now works as a congressional liaison for the Department of
the Army.
   When she found the photo of her cousin Larry, a Vietnam veteran,
she said a wave of combined sadness and joy came over her.
   ``So many young people were killed'' in Vietnam, she said. ``I
was so glad that he made it back.''
   Ms. Wilson said she and her sorority sisters, some of whom are
pictured in another photo, will have a 20-year reunion Sept. 23.
``It's Gamma Theta Rho ... or is it Beta Rho?'' she questioned.
``It's been a long time.''
   A thief had apparently stolen her purse from a locker 19 years
ago when she worked as a secretary at the Lansburgh's department
store. The abandoned building is being torn down.
   The thief took $60 _ her weekly pay _ she said, and apparently
tossed the purse atop the tall, wooden cabinet in the basement of
the store.
   And there it stayed, through the years, until the workers moved
that cabinet.
   ``It's like a dream come true, a fantasy (to have) people you
don't even know to bring back good memories,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``It
goes to show that we do have some good samaritans.''

   Q. I'd like to follow up _
   Q. Mr. President, if I could follow up, there are reports that
the United States does not want to pressure Syria to back off
because we need their help to get the hostages out?
   A. That's wrong.
   I never heard such a report, but if there is such a report you've
heard, it is wrong.
   Yeah.
   Q. Mr. President, in the interview last week, I believe with
Hearst Newspapers, you seemed to say that you would be willing to
kidnap General Noriega to bring him to justice. Is that your policy
and would that be an appropriate thing for the United States
government to do?
   A. We have an indictment out against General Noriega for drug
trafficking.
   I am told that it's a good indictment, that it's an in-depth
indictment, and I'm not saying what I would do or wouldn't do.
   But there was a case where a man named Yusef, I believe _ Younis,
Younis was apprehended and brought to justice.
   And I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice.
   Q. Well, are there any constraints on what means you use, even
though there's a legal indictment, or are there limits on what would
be appropriate in enforcing such an indictment?
   A. There's always limits _ there's always limits in matters of
this nature.
   And the limits, as far as I'm concerned, are the lives of, first
of Americans, and clearly, innocent life.
   You've got to consider those things when you go about whatever it
is _ hostages, or the _ trying to bring Mr. Noriega to justice.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. Mr. President, there was some talk of sending the Green Berets
to South America, do you think _
   A. What was that question?
   Q. Sending the Green Berets _
   A. Yeah.
   Q. _ There has been some talk of sending Green Berets to South
America. Do you think that the DEA is enough to do this job, or not?
And why?
   A. To do the job of _ of helping at the source?
   Well, you have to look at it country-by-country, and then I could
tell you a little more about what the problem is.
   Some of the countries are faced with enormously well-organized
and financed insurgencies.
   Some of them are faced with the most highly financed cartels.
   And so you'd have to look individually.
   And there's _ DEA isn't big enough or strong enough to solve the
problems in these various South American countries; they can help a
lot, and in some areas they have been very, very helpful.
   But I don't think that the DEA alone can solve the problems of
the cartels in Colombia, for example.
   Q. Are you considering sending the Green Berets to South America?
   A. No. No, I'm not considering that.
   Q. Mr. President _
   (Marlin Fitzwater): Final question _
   Q. On the drug plan _
   Bush: This is the final question, Marlin says _
   Q. (Inaudible).
   A. Pre-vacation question.
   Q. Secretary Bennett has indicated that part of the drug plan is
to hold casual users of drugs accountable. Given that many, many
state prisons are overflowing and, indeed, the federal system has no
more room at the present time, what type of accountability are you
looking for? Would it be jail time, or something short of that?
   A. Well, it depends what the _ you know, what the penalty is for
the crime involved.
   And the tolerance, though, of casual users, or the excusing of
one echelon of society for using drugs and then going after another
is unacceptable in a national strategy.
   And so, I'd say we'd have to look at the individual _ individual
case.
   But I think the day of tolerance for those who break the law in
using drugs is over, and should be over.
   And so, we will try to make the punishment fit the crime, if you
will.

   Q. What are you going do about Felix Bloch, Mr. President? What
about Bloch?
   Q. Do you have any political advice for Mario Cuomo? (Laughter.)
   A. Let the legal process go on without a lot of hype.
   That's what I suggest on Felix _
   Q. Mr. President, are you a little concerned about raising
expectations on drugs?
   A. No, I'm not because I think the time has come to encourage
every element in our society, the teacher, the family, the local
community, the state, the federal government to pitch in.
   So, I am not.
   I think it is time that we recognize there is a major national
program _ problem, there are signs that some things can happen
through education, and I cite the decline in cocaine use.
   And I think given that ray of hope, we ought to put on a
full-court press, not just in the federal government, but all across
society to try to solve this problem.
   Q. But isn't your reputation largely on the line given the
promise you made at the inaugural?
   A. Far more important than my reputation is can we solve this
problem, can we make progress against this scourge?
   And so be it, that's the way it is.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the moon moves into the Earth's shadow
Wednesday night, creating a total eclipse visible to perhaps a
billion people, Art Whipple will fire a laser beam at a
breadbox-sized reflector on the lunar surface a quarter of a million
miles away.
   If the astronomer is successful, tiny particles of light will
jump back across the vast distance and be captured by telescopes at
the McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Texas.
   If he's not successful, Whipple says he'll still enjoy the lunar
eclipse _ a rare opportunity to watch the full moon change from a
bright silver to a polished copper or faint orange, or, perhaps,
even vanish from view.
   People on the continents bordering the Atlantic Ocean will have a
chance to see some phase of the lunar eclipse. It will start at 8:23
p.m. EDT and end about 5{ hours later.
   It will be the first full lunar eclipse since December 1982, and
the next one will not occur until December 1992.
   In the United States, the East Coast will have the best viewing,
if skies are clear, while Alaska will miss it altogether. In the
central, mountain and western time zones, the eclipse will be under
way already by the time the moon becomes visible. Moonrise in
Chicago, for instance, is at 7:43 p.m. CDT, twenty minutes after the
eclipse begins. And in Los Angeles, the moon rises at 7:35 p.m. PDT,
when the eclipse is already in totality.
   Cloudy skies could spoil the celestial show for much of the East.
Wednesday forecasts call for thundershowers. Observers may have
better luck in the central and western areas of the country where
clear to partly cloudy skies are predicted for most areas.
   With good local weather, some phase of the spectacle should be
visible to observers in North and South America, western Europe and
Africa, and the Antarctic. Sailors at sea in the Atlantic and in the
eastern Pacific Ocean also will be able to see part of the eclipse.
   A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow
created by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its
orbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline.
   For Whipple, the total eclipse is precious opportunity to fire
laser beams at a darkened full moon.
   The University of Texas and McDonald Observatory astronomer will
be firing the laser at a reflector placed near a lunar feature
called Hadley Rille in 1971 by the Apollo 15 astronauts.
   ``Anytime the moon sites are available, we fire the laser,'' he
said in a telephone interview. But Whipple said it is impossible to
see the laser reflection from a full moon because the natural
surface reflects sunlight so powerfully. Only during an eclipse, he
said, can McDonald scientists detect light reflecting from the
Apollo instruments.
   By clocking the time it takes for light to travel from the laser
to the moon and then back to the McDonald telescopes, scientists are
able to precisely measure the distance between the Earth and its
moon.
   Whipple said in the years since astronomers have been laser
ranging to the Apollo reflectors, they have discovered that the moon
is moving away from the Earth at the rate of about two inches a
year. The mean distance between the Earth and moon is about 230,000
miles.
   But even without the laser experiment, Whipple said the
astronomers are eagerly awaiting the eclipse.
   ``We're looking forward to the show,'' he said.
   During an eclipse, the moon can appear to be a bright coppery red
if there is clean air between the lunar surface and the observer on
Earth. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon can dim to an
faint orange color or even fade from view altogether.
   Dust from volcanic eruptions can contribute to the color, but
astronomers say that enough time has passed since the last major
volcanic eruption that most dust has settled.
   The eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called the
penumbra, the outer fringe of the Earth's shadow. This phase shows
as a grayish shading of the moon. Half an hour later, the moon edges
into the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow. Total eclipse,
when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will begin at about
10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes.
   When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverse
order. The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the moon edges out
of the shadow altogether and regains its customary bright silver
color.

   William Records, the first officer of the
United Airlines DC-10 that crashed, killing 111 people, has been
released from Marian Health Center.
   Records is the last of the crew of Flight 232 to leave the
hospital. He flew home Monday to Washington state on a chartered
Lear jet, said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United in Chicago.
   Flight 232 attempted an emergency landing at Sioux Gateway
Airport on July 19 about 40 minutes after its No. 2 engine
apparently exploded. Officials believe pieces of the disintegrating
engine severed the aircraft's three hydraulic systems, making the
jet almost impossible to steer.
   Pilot Al Haynes, 57, and second officer Dudley Dvorak, 51, were
released July 25 from Marian Health Center.
   Pilot Dennis Fitch, 46, of Bartlett, Ill., who helped guide the
crippled airplane to the airport, was released from Aug. 5. Fitch
was a passenger on Flight 232 but volunteered to help after the
engine explosion.
   One hundred eighty-five of the 296 passengers aboard Flight 232
survived the crash. Six passengers remained in Sioux City hospitals
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Study Says Confidence Growing in Safety of Nation's Blood Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growing understanding about AIDS is building
Americans' confidence in the safety of the nation's blood supply,
but many still believe it is likely they could get the disease by
receiving or donating blood, said a poll released Tuesday.
   The poll conducted for the American Association of Blood Banks
found that 66 percent think the blood supply is safer today than
five years ago, up from 56 percent last year and 44 percent in 1985
when screening for AIDS in blood donations began.
   The survey shows ``the American public understands the steps
being taken to protect the blood supply,'' said Laurence A. Sherman,
president of the association.
   He said, however, gaps remain in the public's understanding.
   More than half of those surveyed, 52 percent, said they believe
it is unlikely they could get AIDS from a blood transfusion.
However, 44 percent considered it likely.
   In fact, Sherman said, the chances of getting AIDS from a
transfusion are extremely low. Since 1985, public health officials
estimate that about 60 people have been infected with the virus
through transfusions, a tiny fraction of the 4 million to 5 million
transfusions performed each year in the United States.
   ``We're not happy with 60,'' but that is far lower than the
30,000 that are believed to have been infected before procedures
were initiated to screen out AIDS-contaminated blood, said Gilbert
Clark, executive director of the association.
   ``The American public wants zero risk ... but zero risk is
unattainable,'' as with any medical procedure, he said.
   Blood banks receive about 12 million blood donations a year.
   Three-quarters of those polled said it was unlikely someone could
get AIDS from donating blood, but 20 percent erroneously believed it
was likely.
   Sherman noted that the proportion of the public believing AIDS
could be transmitted while giving blood has dropped from 34 percent
in 1985, but he said this faulty belief has made if more difficult
to recruit blood donors.
   Overall, the nation's blood supply is ``marginal'' and the amount
of blood in the system has been unchanged for the last several years.
   He said that donating takes more time today than it did before
1985 because blood banks require more detailed questioning of donors
as part of the AIDS-screening efforts. Blood that is donated is also
subjected to an antibody test to detect presence of the AIDS virus.
   For the second year in a row, the survey found that AIDS was
ranked as the most serious health problem facing the country, ahead
of cancer, heart disease and drug abuse. However, fewer _ 31 percent
this year compared with 36 percent last year _ gave it top ranking.
   Black Americans were the only group that showed increasing
concern about AIDS, with 48 percent ranking it as the top health
problem, up from 42 percent last year.
   Among the other findings:
   _Contracting AIDS through a transfusion and difficulties during
recurperation shared second place, each cited by 17 percent, as the
greatest concerns in the case of an operation. The top concern, 27
percent, was complications due to errors made by doctors and medical
staff. Sixteen percent cited complications from anesthesia.
   _41 percent said they feel they have ``a lot'' of accurate
information about AIDS, up 4 points from last year and 20 points
since 1985.
   _16 percent of those polled said they personally knew someone
infected with the AIDS virus, but 82 said they did not.
   _91 percent said favored criminal penalties for people who donate
blood even when they know they are infected with the AIDS virus.
   _82 percent would require mandatory reporting to health officials
the names of people who test positive for AIDS, and 81 percent would
require mandatory testing of high-risk groups, such as drug users,
homosexuals and prostitutes.
   The telephone poll, conducted by Hamilton &amp; Staff of Washington,
D.C., surveyed 1,000 randomly selected adults between June 23 and
July 6. The sampling error for the survey is plus or minus 3
percentage points.

<TEXT>
   The 6-month-old trial of ``Night Stalker''
murder defendant Richard Ramirez took another bizarre twist when a
juror deliberating the case was slain in an apparent domestic
dispute.
   The body of Phyllis Singletary, a 30-year-old telephone employee,
was found Monday afternoon in her home. Neighbors reported hearing
fighting and gunshots in her apartment Friday night and early
Saturday.
   Authorities were seeking her live-in boyfriend, James Cecil
Melton, 51, for questioning, said sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan, who dismissed a juror last
week for sleeping during deliberations at Ramirez's trial on 13
murder charges, replaced Ms. Singletary with an alternate today and
sent the panel home for the day.
   The judge warned that the slaying apparently ``had nothing to do
with this case'' and ``does not add or diminish to the evidence of
whether Mr. Ramirez is guilty or innocent.''
   Both the defense and prosecution expressed a desire to avoid a
mistrial. But defense attorney Ray Clark said he wants jurors to be
polled on whether they feel they are able to go forward. The jury
returns Wednesday.
   Prosecutors allege Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from El Paso,
Texas, is the devil-worshiping ``Night Stalker'' who raped, robbed
and murdered people in their Southern California homes in 1985.
   The jury began deliberations July 26 but was ordered to start
over after the one member was dismissed. Monday was to have been the
first day of the new deliberations, but Ms. Singletary didn't show.

   Advocates for improved pre-natal health care
said Tuesday that spending $400 for expectant mother services can
save a thousand times that amount in lifetime care costs for a low
birthweight infant.
   Pointing out that the infant mortality rate in the United States
is the worst of any of the 18 industrialized nations, the National
Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality called for ``universal
access'' to early maternity and pediatric care for all mothers and
infants.
   In a report issued this month, the commission said employers
should make sure the health insurance they offer covers maternity
and well-baby care, and called on the government to assume the
responsibility for those who don't have insurance.
   ``We can spend the money now or we can spend a lot more later,''
said the report. ``The costs of prenatal care _ care that can
prevent low birthweight _ can be as little as $400 per mother.
   ``The lifetime costs of caring for a low birthweight infant can
reach $400,000.''
   Low birthweight is the leading cause of infant deaths and chronic
and disabling illness, the commission said. Low birthweight babies
are those born at less than five and a half pounds.
   ``This is very serious business,'' Dr. Reed Tuckson, commissioner
of health for the District of Columbia. He said the infant mortality
rate for blacks is twice that for whites and named the crack cocaine
problem as the reason for a recent increase in infant deaths in the
district.
   He and other panelists appeared for an infant mortality symposium
sponsored by the Congressional Black Associates and the Young Black
Professionals at the Capitol.
   The group acknowledged that a tight federal budget meant little
money for pre-natal care programs, and Tuckson pointed out that much
of the funding for public health concerns was now going to find a
cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   But the panel said publicity could do a lot to get expectant
mothers to available health care facilities.

   With the collapse of complete communist
control of parliament, the once docile United Peasants Party has
emerged as an independent political force whose leaders seem
determined to play a major role.
   Prime Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak said Monday he is ready to
give up trying to form a government in favor of Roman Malinowski,
the leader of the Peasant Party.
   Malinowski, who has favored continuing his party's historical
alliance with the communist party, would be asked to create a
Cabinet composed of representatives of all forces in parliament,
according to Kiszczak.
   But the 54-year-old economist, who has led the party since 1981
and was among top communist coalition candidates who were defeated
in June parliamentary elections, faces opposition from Peasant
lawmakers in parliament who fear reprisals at the polls if the
party's links with the unpopular communists are not cut.
   Led by Aleksander Bentkowski, their independent-minded
parliamentary floor leader, at least one third of the 76 Peasant
deputies favor forming a coalition government with Solidarity.
   As the third-largest group in parliament, in which neither the
larger communists or Solidarity lawmakers holds a majority, the
Peasants suddenly have been catapulted into the role of kingmaker.
   The split between the party leadership and its representatives in
parliament comes as the Peasants search for a new identity in
response to voter disenchantment with the old party model and with
an eye to completely free elections promised in the future.
   The peasant movement in Poland has deep roots, with the first
organized Polish Peasant Party founded in Rzeszow, then in
Austria-ruled Galicia, in 1895. Rzeszow, now in southeast Poland,
remains a center of rural activism.
   Before and after World War II, the party advocated land reform to
free the peasantry from the control of large wealthy landowners. In
pre-war Poland, it was an important political force, with its leader
Wincenty Witos serving as premier three times.
   One of its leaders, Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, also headed the Polish
government-in-exile in London during World War II.
   The Polish Peasants Party enjoyed a brief period of independent
activity in Poland after World War II. But the communist party that
swept to power as a result of Soviet military might forced the
merger of the independent party, known as the PSL, with a
pro-communist Peasant Party, the SL, in 1949 to form the ZSL _ as
the United Peasant Party is now known.
   In that era of Stalinist purges, independent Peasant leaders were
forced to flee the country, step down or bend to communist rule.
   In the most notorious case, Mikolajczyk, the wartime premier and
only member of the London government to risk coming back to Poland
after the war to join a communist-led coalition, fled in 1947 when
it became clear he was facing arrest and a show trial.
   He was denounced as a spy and lost his citizenship in 1949. Only
this year was his citizenship restored posthumously by the Council
of State.
   For most of the history of the Polish People's Republic, the
Peasant Party _ like the other minor party, the Democrats _ has
obediently followed communist policy.
   In the last decade, as a result of political reforms, the Peasant
Party has been allowed to develop a more independent policy while
still acknowledging the communist party's ``leading role.'' It
traditionally has exercised broad powers in rural areas and often
holds the ministry of agriculture.
   The ZSL claims a membership of 500,000 and says it represents the
interests of farmers.
   Peasant deputies resenting communist domination of the policies
of their own party were critical of Malinowski's defense of
continued obedience to the communists at a caucus last week.
   Deputies favoring a coalition with Solidarity also have said
their constituents resented Kiszczak's election as prime minister
because it left the impression that nothing has changed, despite
Solidarity's victory at the polls in June.
   The internal revolt within the ZSL took on a new dimension
Tuesday, as 120 peasant activists from around the country met in
Warsaw and decided to resume the activities of Mikolajczyk's old
PSL, which was declared illegal in 1947, the state news agency PAP
said.
   Participants, who included representatives from Rural Solidarity,
the independent farmers' union, said the party would be revived on
the basis of the program adopted by the PSL in 1946.

   Thousands of people cheered, and 15 quietly
protested, as Marines stormed a city-owned beach on Lake Erie on
Tuesday in a recruitment drive.
   ``Just to see the vast majority of people here getting up early
and watching us makes me proud of the service I do in the Marine
Corps,'' said Staff Sgt. Sam Adkins of Chattanooga, Tenn.
   ``I feel it's my job to protect the people I see here,'' said
Adkins, dressed in full combat gear and with his face blackened with
camouflage.
   Police Capt. Cel Rivera estimated that 10,000 people turned out
at Lakeview Beach to watch a company of about 100 Marines board four
landing craft from the USS Boulder and land on the beach in a
morning mist.
   Fifteen people staged a silent protest at a gazebo overlooking
the beach, holding anti-war placards and distributing literature.
   ``This whole thing is so silly, the idea that you can make a war
a carnival,'' said the Rev. Steve Hammond, a co-pastor at First
Baptist Church in Oberlin.
   The protesters represented various groups, including the Lorain
County Peace and Justice Commission, Clergy and Laity Concerned and
the Baptist Peace Fellowship.
   But most of the crowd cheered the Marines and scampered across
the beach to inspect the landing craft.
   ``I liked it,'' said Gary Jones of Westlake, who was holding his
1-year-old son, Bradford. Jones said he wanted to see ``where your
tax dollar goes.''
   Gov. Richard Celeste had refused the Marines permission to land
June 24 at Cleveland's Edgewater State Park as part of a 20-city
recruiting promotion tour of the Great Lakes region.
   Celeste, whose action was denounced by veterans' groups, said the
landing would be an inappropriate use of the park.
   After the Marines landed and held a brief formation, they mixed
with the crowd, which included families sitting on picnic blankets
and a Navy band playing jazz music.

   F.W. de Klerk became acting
president Tuesday and pledged faster action on limited racial policy
reforms begun by his predecessor, P.W. Botha, but did not say what
he would do.
   ``There is no doubt that we stand on the threshold of a new era
in South Africa. History offers us a unique opportunity for peaceful
solutions,'' de Klerk said at the brief swearing-in ceremony in
Pretoria.
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading critic of the government,
said: ``All he is doing is giving a new face to apartheid.''
   The transition is ``just a change of initials from P.W. to F.W,''
said the black Anglican Church leader, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace
Prize for his work against apartheid.
   In Washington, the State Department said it hoped for an ``active
dialogue'' with the new leadership on ending apartheid, the official
policy of racial discrimination. It held out the possibility of a
visit by de Klerk, who also heads the governing National Party.
   Botha, who led South Africa for 11 often turbulent years,
resigned Monday night after repeated confrontations with his Cabinet.
   National Party leaders tried to persuade the 73-year-old
president to leave gracefully after he suffered a stroke Jan. 18,
but Botha refused. His stubborn, defiant manner resulted in
embarrassing public battles likely to hurt the party in
parliamentary elections Sept. 6.
   There was no evidence of policy disputes with the Cabinet, but
younger leaders appeared to believe Botha's age, health and growing
political isolation made him unable to continue the gradual, limited
reforms he introduced in the early 1980s.
   After nationwide black unrest developed in 1984, Botha
increasingly turned away from reform and relied on repression to
stifle black political demands.
   De Klerk praised Botha on Tuesday for starting reform.
   ``His greatest gift to South Africa is the fact that he has put
our country on the road to fundamental reform, that he has
successfully started pulling South Africa out of its dead-end
streets,'' he told reporters after being sworn in by Chief Justice
Michael Corbett.
   He repeated his intention to speed reform, but did not pledge
specific action on such major apartheid issues as sharing power with
blacks, who outnumber whites 28 million to 5 million and have no
voice in national affairs.
   ``We want to build a new South Africa in which all people
participate in decisions affecting their lives at all levels,'' de
Klerk said.
   ``I trust that the people of South Africa will show the courage
and vision required to break the cycle of conflict, tension and
isolation that has gripped us for so long.''
   Since taking over from Botha in February as leader of the
National Party, which has governed since 1948, de Klerk has stressed
the need for immediate reform to end South Africa's deep racial
divisions and international isolation.
   His speeches are more conciliatory than Botha's, his personal
style affable rather than confrontational. At age 53, he belongs to
a younger generation more receptive to change.
   Through 17 years in politics, however, he has been a loyal
supporter of the National Party _ including limited race reforms
that reject majority rule. De Klerk has not set himself apart from
any Botha policies and has yet to name apartheid laws he would
repeal.
   The African National Congress, the main guerrilla movement
fighting white supremacy, said Botha ``dedicated his life to the
construction of the apartheid system and its defense at all costs.''
   ``He has brought death and destruction to millions of people in
South Africa and the rest of the region ... through a systematic
campaign of brutal repression,'' general secretary Alfred Nzo said
in Lusaka, Zambia, where the group has its headquarters.
   South African media also had harsh words about the former
president.
   ``The last image that will linger for many years is that of a
blind Samson who with his last strength tried to overturn the
pillars of his party on himself and his own companions,'' said
Beeld, an Afrikaans-language daily that had supported Botha.
   Although the National Party is favored in next month's elections,
it is expected to lose ground to both the anti-apartheid Democratic
Party on its left and the segregationist Conservative Party on its
right.
   De Klerk said he will convene a new Parliament a week after the
election. If the Nationalists win, he is expected to become
president for a full five-year term.

<HEAD>Bush Says Hostages Could Come Home if Iran Wanted it So</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday he could not claim
American hostages in Lebanon were any closer to freedom despite an
intense diplomatic effort but that there was ``a good likelihood''
they could come home if Iran wanted them released.
   Renewing his appeal for assistance from the new leaders in
Tehran, Bush said, ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the
rest of our lives. We've had a good relationship with them in the
past'' before breaking off relations a decade ago.
   Iran, accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, is
the major bankroller of Hezbollah, the radical group thought to be
an umbrella for various factions of the hostage-holders.
   ``I think that if Iran wanted those hostages to come out of
there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen _
perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood,'' the president
said.
   He said that there were limits on possible military action to
free the hostages, that he did not want to see innocent people
killed and would have to weigh the risks to U.S. forces that would
be involved.
   ``But if I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and
bring them out, and that required using the military force of the
United States, make no mistake about it _ I would do it in an
instant,'' the president said.
   ``At some point we have to stand up for our interests, even if it
means military, yet I'm not threatening military action,'' he said.
   Bush discussed the hostage situation in a half-hour news
conference on the eve of his departure for a three-week vacation at
his seaside compound at Kennebunkport, Maine.
   He promised that one day after his Labor Day return to
Washington, he would unveil a new anti-drug program that is
``balanced, decisive, effective and achievable.''
   Bush said the program would require more federal spending but not
higher taxes, adding that the money would be diverted from other
programs.
   While the hostage crisis and, to a lesser extent, drugs,
dominated the news conference, he commented on other subjects
ranging including economic policy and Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega. The president:
   _ Refused to rule out the possibility of abducting Noriega to
stand trial in the United States on drug-trafficking charges. ``I
have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' Bush said.
   _ Pronounced himself ``very comfortable'' with budget director
Richard Darman's comment that the Federal Reserve was keeping
interest rates too high to permit sustained growth.
   However, when asked if he agreed with Darman that the Fed would
be responsible for any recession if interest rates don't drop, Bush
sidestepped, saying ``I don't recall that part of it and (I'll) take
that under advisement and let you know at a later date.''
   _ Said he wished the legal process could proceed ``without a lot
of hype'' in the case of Felix Bloch, a State Department official
suspected of espionage. Bloch has not been charged.
   _ Eulogized Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Larkin Smith,
R-Miss., who died in separate plane crashes. He said they were
``fine individuals (who) represented a deep caring for the poor, the
disadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and many other
areas of our society that need improving.''
   The plight of the eight Americans held hostage in Lebanon was
pushed to the fore after Israeli commandos seized a Moslem cleric in
Lebanon, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, on July 28. In response, a group
called the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth contended it had
hanged American Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   Asked if the American hostages were any closer to freedom now as
a result of the developments of the past few weeks, Bush said, ``I
can't say that today, but we're going to keep on trying.''
   Bush said that with Hashemi Rafsanjani assuming the presidency of
Iran, ``we hear different signals coming out of Iran _ some in the
old monde and then some that offer more hope.
   He said the release of the hostages would send ``a clear and good
signal'' of Iran's intentions, adding that ``there are many ways
that countries who are estranged can get back together, from
diplomatic relations or a wide array of other things.''
   Asked if the United States might seek the extradition of Obeid,
who has been said to have been instrumental in Higgins' abduction,
Bush said ``we have no indictment'' against Obeid.
   Later, Bush said, ``If the justice system goes forward and there
is an indictment against him, I would be remiss if I didn't try to
see him brought to trial.''
   Bush seemed caught off guard momentarily when a questioner asked
why the United States had not retaliated for Higgins' death.
   ``If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, private
sector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostages
out or guard against future hostage taking, I would take such
action,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.N. Calls Camps `Life Threatening'; 124 Volunteer to Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong's teeming
detention centers are in danger of dying because of malnutrition and
disease, the top U.N. refugee official in the colony said Tuesday.
   Robert van Leeuwen called for better food and ``a massive
immunization campaign'' for boat people being housed on an outlying
island and on five ferries in Hong Kong's harbor.
   Also on Tuesday, 124 Vietnamese refugees, convinced their quest
for a new life is over, have volunteered to return to the country
they fled.
   The group, ranging from elderly women to four babies, is
scheduled to fly to Vietnam on Thursday in the biggest such
repatriation of boat people since the first group left in March.
   Van Leeuwen based his statements on a preliminary report by U.N.
officials about camps housing 6,700 of Hong Kong's 51,000 boat
people.
   Large numbers of children in a camp at Tai A Chau Island and the
ferries were suffering from ``borderline malnutrition,'' Van Leeuwen
said, although he not say how many.
   ``When you have a population which has become weakened through
below-standard levels of nutrition they become very vulnerable to an
outbreak of disease which could have life threatening
consequences,'' he said. ``They cannot be expected to continue much
longer with the diet provided.''
   Van Leeuwen's statement is one of several recent criticisms made
recently by U.N. officials of Hong Kong's handling of the boat
people.
   Last week, another U.N. official said the camps were some of the
worst he had seen.
   ``The space is less than the space given to people in prison
here,'' said Omar Bakhet, head of the technical support unit for the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Hong Kong. ``It is
even less than what is supposed to be given here for a dog.''
   The U.N. organization has alleged that more than 100 boat people
were beaten by police during a July 23 disturbance at a detention
center in the New Territories section of Hong Kong.
   Opposition to the refugees is growing in this crowded colony of 5
million people. Residents of one village have organized protests and
sit-ins against a planned camp near the High Island reservoir in the
New Territories.
   The opposition was evident Tuesday when reporters were brought to
the Lo Wu detention center near the Chinese border to speak with
some of the voluntary returnees.
   Posters reading, ``Say no to Viets,'' and ``No more Viets,''
lined the entrance to the camp.
   Inside the camp, a former army post, children and women in ragged
clothing looked out through barbed-wire fences. Vietnamese men in
T-shirts smiled and asked for cigarettes.
   ``Those people who still have hope will stay,'' said Truang Van
Bong, a 21-year-old fisherman from Haiphong. ``I have no more hope
so I'm going back. I think my government won't punish me. I believe
the assurances of the United Nations.''
   Vietnam has promised it won't prosecute its returning citizens.
   Other refugees said they were returning because they missed their
families.
   ``I miss my old mother very much,'' said Le Thi Minh, 39, a
fishmonger from Haiphong. She said her brother was unable to care
for her mother because he is in jail for trying to flee Vietnam.
   ``We all have to take risks,'' she said about returning. ``But
for me the pull of my family is too strong.''
   The group of 124 will be the third to leave Hong Kong since the
voluntary repatriation program began in March. So far, groups of 75
and 68 boat people have returned home.
   Adult returnees are given $50 and children 14 and under are given
$25. The U.N. will also assist them once they return to their homes
with a food allowance.
   They are among the 38,300 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong
Kong since the British colony adopted a tough policy last year
ruling out resettlement for most of them.
   Under the new policy, Vietnamese are considered refugees only if
they can prove they fled their homeland beccause of persecution.

   President Bush paid tribute anew Tuesday to
Reps. Mickey Leland of Texas and Larkin Smith of Mississippi,
calling them ``outstanding public servants'' who gave their lives
trying to ``better the lot of mankind.''
   The president, opening a news conference, spoke out again on the
``tragic aircraft accidents'' that killed the two lawmakers six days
apart.
   Leland, a Democrat from Houston, perished Aug. 7 with 15 others
on a mercy flight in Ethiopia, while Smith, a Republican from Long
Beach, Miss., was killed Sunday night with his pilot in Mississippi.
   ``I want to note again the passing of two outstanding public
servants,'' said Bush.
   ``Their passing is mourned by everyone who knew them, and Barbara
and I extend our sympathies to their families and friends during
this difficult period,'' he said.
   ``Their death also reminds us that there are outstanding men and
women in public life who are working at every level of government to
better the lot of mankind. And these two fine individuals
represented a deep caring for the poor, the disadvantaged, the
vistims of drug abuse and crime, and many other areas of our society
that need improving.''

   A Chinese passenger plane faltered during takeoff
Tuesday and plunged into a river near the Shanghai airport, killing
18 people, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
   Television news said the Antonov-24, a twin-turboprop of Soviet
design, carried 32 passengers and eight crew members. Xinhua said
rescuers were trying to extricate survivors from the wreckage near
Hongqiao airport, 12 miles north of Shanghai.
   It was the first Chinese air accident since August 1988, when a
flight from Canton crashed while landing at Hong Kong, killing seven
people.
   Five major crashes, which killed 172 people, were reported in
1988. Hu Yizhou, head of the national airline, said early this year
there were ``serious problems'' with safety and called for
improvements.
   Xinhua quoted witnesses as saying the Antonov seemed to go out of
control as it became airborne, then plunged into the river about 100
yards away.
   Flight 5510 of China Eastern Airlines, a subsidiary of the
national Civil Aviation Administration of China, was bound for
Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi province in southern China, 600 miles
southwest of Shanghai.
   The worst death toll last year was in a crash near Chungking in
the southwest that killed all 108 people on the aircraft.

<HEAD>First-Time Crack Dealer Gets Life in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 30-year-old crack dealer with no prior
police record has been sentenced to life in prison without
possibility of parole on his first conviction.
   Ernest ``Polo'' Staley ``had a decision to make, and that was
whether to deal in crack or not,'' U.S. Attorney Mike Moore said.
``And he chose to deal in crack. He got exactly what Congress wanted
for that decision.''
   At Monday's sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge William
Stafford was unswayed by Staley's pleas for mercy.
   ``It seems to me your activity was the type you could stop at any
time,'' Stafford said. ``You were the wheel on which this whole
operation spun.''
   But defense attorney Robin Rosen argued for mercy.
   ``I've represented people who took lives and received less of a
sentence,'' Rosen said. ``It's a tragedy. I'm not saying this as an
attorney, I'm saying this as a human being: Everybody has worth and
dignity. Everybody should have a chance at rehabilitation.''
   Staley, convicted June 1, made as much as $25,000 a week, one
witness estimated. Staley ferried cocaine from Fort Pierce, cooked
the powder into crack rocks in a microwave oven, then kept the
street dealers supplied, witnesses said.
   Prosecutors argued that Staley's case met federal guidelines for
a life sentence. Besides heading the drug ring, the case involved
more than one kilogram of crack, a firearm was found, and Staley
tried to bribe a witness not to testify by offering $10,000 or a
Mercedes Benz. He also refused to reveal the source of his cocaine.
   Staley implored the judge for a second chance.
   ``I can remember J.F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King saying every
man and woman makes a difference. In order to make a difference, you
have to be given a chance,'' he told the judge.
   Staley said he'd already begun rehabilitation while in federal
custody for the past 14 months.
   ``My intention is to set up a drug foundation to help somebody
with a drug problem,'' Staley said. ``I know drugs are a terrible

<HEAD>Bush Hints Abducting Noriega Might Be Justifiable</HEAD>

   President Bush, saying ``I'm not holding my
breath'' waiting for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step aside,
Tuesday hinted that abduction of the Panamanian leader might be
justifiable.
   ``I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' Bush
told a news conference. He cited the FBI's 1987 abduction of a
Lebanese highjacker as precedent for such long-arm tactics.
   Noriega remains under 1988 indictments on U.S. drug-conspiracy
charges.
   While declining to say whether abducting Noriega was actually
being considered, Bush said: ``We have an indictment out against
Gen. Noriega for drug trafficking. I'm told that it's a good
indictment, that it's an in-depth indictment.''
   Expanding on remarks he made in an interview last week with
reporters from Hearst Newspapers, Bush told the nationally broadcast
news conference: ``I'm not saying what I would do or wouldn't do,
but there was a case where a man named Younis was apprehended and
brought to justice.''
   It was a reference to the FBI hostage rescue squad's grabbing on
Sept. 13, 1987, of Lebanese hijacker Fawaz Younis in the
Mediterranean Sea.
   U.S. agents lured Younis aboard a yacht 13 miles off the coast of
Cyprus with the prospect of a drug deal and a party. He was later
convicted in U.S. District Court in Washington of leading five
heavily armed men in hijacking Royal Jordanian Airlines Flight 402
and holding 70 passengers and crew hostage for 30 hours in Beirut.
   Bush reaffirmed the longstanding U.S. view that normal relations
with Panama cannot resume so long as Noriega remains in power.
   However, Noriega, whose regime annulled a May 7 presidential
election that international observers said was won by opposition
candidate Guillermo Endara, has shown no signs of yielding to U.S.
demands that he step down.
   A team of international mediators is in Panama now negotiating
terms of a resolution by the Organization of American States (OAS)
calling for new elections on Sept. 1.
   ``Part of our understanding on the OAS agreement was that Noriega
would be out,'' Bush said. But, he added: ``I'm not holding my
breath on his voluntary departure.''
   Bush also told reporters that he had recently told opposition
candidate Endara that ``We will continue to support what the people
of Panama voted for.''
   A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Bush's vow of support for Endara did not put
the administration at odds with the OAS agreement to promote new
elections Sept. 1, conditioned on a transfer of power from Noriega's
regime to a transitional government.
   The United States supports that plan, said the official, although
it continues to believe that Endara fairly won the election.
   Noriega, commander of Panama's defense forces and de facto
leader, said last week that he was not going to step down, despite
the OAS agreement. He has been in power for six years.
   Last Wednesday, Bush told reporters from Hearst Newspapers that
``I wouldn't rule out any option'' when asked if he would consider
seizing Noriega to bring him to trial in the United States.
   According to some published accounts, former President Reagan
considered a plan to abduct Noriega while he was visiting his
daughter in the Dominican Republic, but rejected it as too risky.

   The sun didn't shine into Tsutomu Miyazaki's room.
   The single window of the room where police believe Miyazaki
mutilated the body of 5-year-old Ayako Nomoto was blocked by piles
of comic books, pornography and children's cartoon videotapes.
   Police announced Tuesday that the 26-year-old print shop worker
had confessed to killing and mutilating three girls in what
television news is calling the worst murder case in Japan's postwar
history.
   Miyazaki was arrested Friday in connection with the killing of
Ayako in June.
   Police said Miyazaki also confessed to strangling Mari Konno, 4,
in August 1988, burning the body and leaving it on her parents'
doorstep; and strangling Erika Namba, also 4, in December and
dumping her body on a mountain.
   Television and newspaper coverage, including images of the
suspect's room, has stirred fear in the homes of Japanese unfamiliar
with the level of violent crime in many other societies.
   The child slayings are the latest in a series of murders of
startling brutality by Japanese youth.
   Experts have been filling the airwaves with analyses of the
impact of violent sex imagery that is perhaps more pervasive in
Japanese popular culture than in any other developed country.
   Japanese barely blink at the graphic scenes of rape and murder
they see in sports newspapers and comic books. They usually ignore
the ads plastering telephone booths for prostitution services.
   Now, the extraordinary attention given the Miyazaki case, which
has dominated the front pages of national newspapers for days, has
stunned the Japanese and stirred concern about sex and violence in
the media.
   Police told local newspapers that the videos Miyazaki collected
ranged from cartoons to child pornography and violent movies.
   Authorities say Miyazaki confessed that in early June, he
kidnapped the 5-year-old near her suburban apartment, killed her,
mutilated her body and dumped it in a cemetery.
   Members of Miyazaki's video club told newspapers he was an
obsessive collector of cartoon tapes. His main hobbies, news reports
say, were copying tapes and doing pornographic photography.
   His parents simply described him as shy. ``He was always so quiet
that we wanted him to hurry up and get married so we could stop
worrying about him,'' they told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.
   Some experts blame violent videos for contributing to his mental
state and that of other people like him.
   ``If such videos were not so widely available, crimes like this
might not have happened,'' said Susumu Oda, professor of mental
health at Tsukuba University. ``For people with this kind of
disposition, videos can help put plans in their heads.''
   Another reportedly obsessive video hobbyist, Yoshiaki Kataoka,
21, was arrested Monday on suspicion of videotaping and sexually
abusing more than 30 girls.
   Kozo Hida, a 22-year-old mechanic who reportedly spent most of
his free time playing video games with neighborhood children, was
arrested earlier this year on suspicion of strangling one of them.
   Gang violence also is worrying many Japanese.
   In June, a young man received the death sentence _ a rarity for a
minor _ for his role in slaying a young couple out for a drive. A
group of teen-agers beat the couple with iron rods, raped the woman,
and killed both of them.

<HEAD>East German Asylum-Seekers Move Vigil in Budapest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of East Germans who want to
flee to the West moved their vigil Tuesday from the closed West
German Consulate to a nearby church, while German and Hungarian
officials negotiated their fate.
   These and other East Germans, who demand permission to emigrate
via West German diplomatic facilities in the East bloc, have created
a standoff involving their communist homeland, West Germany and
Hungary.
   West German diplomats closed their Budapest consulate and embassy
Monday because they said they could not handle the crush of East
Germans demanding asylum.
   Rezsoe Stuchlik, head of the Hungarian Red Cross foreign section,
said Tuesday about 200 East Germans had come from the consulate to
the courtyard of a Roman Catholic church about two miles away.
   An East German outside the church grounds said later the number
had risen to about 300.
   About 30 East Germans remained in front of the consulate. They
said West Germany diplomats had given them money.
   ``I'm staying here as long as it takes,'' said a 47-year-old man
from the Berlin area who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``One
month, two months, I don't care.''
   Varying numbers of East Germans have been maintaining a vigil in
front of the embassy and consulate for at least a week. They had
been allowed inside at night until the buildings closed Monday.
   In Bonn, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher said Monday
that 141 other adults and 40 children were holed up inside the
embassy in Budapest. Political opposition figures estimate that 400
East Germans have overstayed their visas and gone underground.
   West Germany closed its East Berlin mission Aug. 8 after 131 East
Germans seeking guarantees that they can go to West Germany sought
refuge there.
   Negotiations involving both German states and Hungary continued
Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said. It gave no details.
   In Bonn, government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said Chancellor
Helmut Kohl wrote a letter on the problems in Hungary to East German
leader Erich Honecker. He did not say what the letter said.
   Red Cross officials said they didn't know how long the East
Germans at the Budapest church would continue their vigil. ``We have
means of taking care of them for about two weeks, but we're
considering longer-range plans,'' said Stuchlik.
   Speaking by telephone, Stuchlik said tents may be erected in the
courtyard by Wednesday. He said the Red Cross and the Hungarian
Maltesian Caritas Service, a charity group, were providing three
meals a day for the East Germans.
   Hungarian authorities were not consulted about the move to the
church, he said.
   He said the Hungarian Red Cross could turn to the International
Red Cross if it ran out of money and food for the East Germans.
   An East German consulate statement carried by the Hungarian news
agency MTI urged all East Germans staying here illegally to return
home. It also repeated a pledge that they would not be prosecuted
for escape attempts or overstaying visas.
   East Germans began asking for asylum in Budapest last month after
failed attempts to escape across the Austrian border, where liberal
Hungarian authorities have removed fences. The East Germans say they
fear persecution at home because they tried to flee.
   At least 1,600 East Germans are estimated to have crossed
illegally into Austria from Hungary since the fences came down in
May. Once in Austria, they try to obtain papers from the West German
Embassy in Vienna for travel to West Germany.
   East Germans can easily visit Hungary, but it is difficult for
them to travel legally to the West.
   The East German who commented at the church said West German
diplomats on church grounds were issuing West German passports to
the East Germans.
   According to West German law, all East Germans have a right to
West German passports. Consulate and embassy personnel routinely
issued passports to all East Germans seeking them before the two
compounds closed.
   However, Hungarian border authorities have not allowed bearers of
West German passports made out in Budapest to cross into Austria.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills on
Tuesday expressed support for increasing tax benefits for individual
savers, contending that expanded Individual Retirement Accounts
would help boost the country's low savings rate and reduce America's
huge trade deficit.
   Hills stressed that her endorsement did not mean that the
administration had decided to propose such a change, which has the
potential of benefiting millions of Americans.
   But other officials have said the administration is readying a
fall campaign to address the chronically low U.S. savings rate and
that expanding tax benefits to individual investors who use IRAs was
one of the ideas being considered.
   Hills said that expanding IRAs would ``highlight the great need
for private savings to go up. It sends up a flag saying, this is
very important, not only to your nation, but to your own future and
to your children.''
   One reason long advanced for America's high trade deficits is
that Americans consume more than the country can produce
domestically. If Americans could be persuaded to cut back on
consumption and save more, then it would limit the need for foreign
goods, economists reason.
   Higher U.S. savings rates would also lower the cost of capital
for U.S. businesses and make their products more competitive on
overseas markets.
   Hills said she did not know anyone in the administration who
opposed increasing IRA tax benefits but she said there was concern
over such questions as the potential loss of federal revenue.
   The huge cost to the treasury of IRAs was one reason that they
were greatly scaled back by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. As a result,
the number of tax returns claiming IRA deductions fell from 15.5
million in 1987 to 7.4 million last year.
   The administration is considering a variety of proposals to boost
U.S. savings rates as part of a fall initiative designed to address
long-range problems facing the country. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady is scheduled to kick off the campaign with a series of
speeches, officials have said.
   The personal savings rate, savings as a percent of after-tax
income fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and increased
only slightly to 4.2 percent last year. By contrast, the savings
rate in Japan was 16.5 percent in 1987.
   Hills said that increasing the U.S. savings rate would help her
answer charges from Japanese trade negotiators that the United
States has not done enough on its own to solve its huge trade
deficit.
   Currently, Hills is holding negotiations with Japan, Brazil and
India in an effort to get those nations to lower trade barriers
cited by the administration last May when it issued a ``hit list''
of the countries with the most harmful barriers to sales of American
products.
   The Japanese have countered that America should make progress in
boosting its savings rate and cutting its huge federal budget
deficit as a way of lessening its dependence on foreign capital.
   The administration's various trade opening initiatives are aimed
at lowering the country's huge trade deficit, which measured $126.5
billion last year on a current account basis covering trade in both
merchandise and services.
   Hills said the current account deficit over the next 18 months
may actually rise ``a little,'' reflecting the rise in the value of
the dollar, which makes American goods less competitive on overseas
markets.
   ``It is hard to predict, but I do not look for a dramatic drop in
the trade deficit,'' she said.

   A research lab worker has been
hospitalized with a probable case of a deadly monkey virus that
killed one co-worker and infected another.
   Gary Merkle, 32, of Mattawan, was in fair condition Tuesday in
Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo, hospital spokesman William
Russell said.
   Test results for Merkle, who was admitted Saturday, are pending.
He is ``considered a probable case of herpes B virus,'' Russell said.
   Thomas McGeorge, 23, of Kalamazoo died in June from the virus
after he was infected through a bite or scratch from a research
monkey at International Research and Development Corp. of Mattawan,
an independent contract lab.
   Another former IRDC employee is infected with the virus, which is
present in more than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys, a type of Old
World monkey commonly used in experiments.
   The virus is harmless to animals, but attacks the brain and
central nervous system in humans and has an estimated 70 percent
mortality rate once symptoms appear.
   IRDC corporate officials are out of town and Merkle's employment
status could not be confirmed, company spokesman James Webb said.
   On July 28, the public health department levied $30,600 in fines
against IRDC for alleged violations of worker safety regulations and
for failing to tell all employees who worked with the monkeys about
the risks they faced.
   IRDC officials have denied the allegations and are appealing.
   The company, which employs about 350 people, uses thousands of
animals, including monkeys dogs, rabbits and rats, to test drugs and
chemicals for pharmaceutical, veterinary and agricultural companies.

<TEXT>
   Comedy shows, led by ABC's ``Roseanne,''
claimed all the places in the Top 10 of the Neilsen television
ratings for the week ended Aug. 13.
   In second place was NBC's ``Cheers,'' which has been running a
close race all summer with ``Roseanne'' for first.
   NBC, the No. 1 network for the 60th straight week, had six shows
in the Top 10 and second-place ABC had four. CBS, running third, was
squeezed completely out of the top slots and had only three shows in
the first 20.
   The sitcoms in the Top 10 were: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's
``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Wonder Years,'' NBC's ``Dear John,'' NBC's ``A
Different World,'' NBC's ``Golden Girls'' and ABC's ``Coach'' tied,
NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' and NBC's
``Empty Nest.''
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
10.9. ABC was second with 9.8 and CBS was third with 9.1.
   For the season to date, from Sept. 19, 1988, NBC leads with 14.6,
ABC is second with 11.8 and CBS is third with 11.7. The rating is
the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes with television
in the United States. The share is the percentage of sets in use.
   Two NBC summer shows continued to do poorly in the ratings.
``Knight &amp; Daye'' was in a tie for 44th place and ``13 East'' fell
again to a tie for 47th place. ``13 East'' made its debut in 10th
place, then dropped to 35th place last week.
   ABC's new magazine show ``Primetime Live'' was in 43rd place,
after its premiere the week before in 37th place.
   ``Married...With Children'' was again Fox Broadcasting's
highest-rated show, finishing 36th. Fox's ``Totally Hidden Video''
was 39th and ``America's Most Wanted'' was tied for 47th with ``13
East.''
   ``The CBS Evening News'' was first among the news shows, giving
CBS its only consolation for the week. CBS had a rating of 9.0, ABC
was second with 8.7 and NBC was third with 8.3.
   The lowest-rated network show was ABC's ``Incredible Sunday.''
Here are the five bottom network shows: CBS' ``Tour of Duty,'' CBS'
``Beauty and the Beast,'' ABC's ``A Man Called Hawk,'' ABC's ``The
Devil and Max Devlin'' and ABC's ``Incredible Sunday.''

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Calls For Meeting to Solve Government Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski called
Tuesday for an emergency meeting of Poland's political leaders to
seek ``rational solutions'' to a growing government crisis that he
said threatens the nation's stability.
   The call was seconded by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who also
said that ``if society wants it,'' he would agree to serve as prime
minister.
   If Solidarity succeeds in winning the prime minister's post, it
would be the first non-communist government in the East bloc since
the late 1940s.
   Prime minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said Monday he is ready to resign
and abandon efforts to assemble a Cabinet in the face of
Solidarity's opposition to any communist-led government. Kiszczak
became prime minister 12 days ago.
   He urged that United Peasant Party Chairman Roman Malinowski, a
communist loyalist, be selected by Jaruzelski to form a ``grand
coalition'' government that would include communists and members of
Solidarity.
   But the proposal of Malinowski drew little interest from other
political groups, and Malinowski himself by late Tuesday had not
answered whether he wants to be considered a candidate.
   Walesa reiterated his proposal to form a government based on a
coalition of Solidarity, the Peasant Party and the Democratic Party,
with some sensitive posts left to the communists.
   In the confused political situation, the state PAP news agency
said Jaruzelski ``expresses his concern over the deepening
instability of Poland's political and economic situation.''
   ``The president intends to appeal to representatives of the main
political forces in the country for participation in a joint meeting
devoted to seeking rational solutions ... as soon as possible,'' PAP
said.
   Jaruzelski also asked for restraint in ``political and social
emotions, which make national accord more difficult.'' He contacted
Walesa through private channels to ask him for a meeting, possibly
on Wednesday, said Walesa aide Krzysztof Pusz.
   The joint meeting was likely to bring together representatives of
the three parties and Solidarity, who were the main figures in last
spring's successful talks that led to an accord on elections and
legalizing the independent trade union movement after a seven-year
ban.
   Walesa said he welcomed Kiszczak's decision to abandon forming a
government but rejected Malinowski as prime minister. He said the
parties in the coalition discussions should decide on a candidate.
   ``If society wants it, I will have to go for the prime minister's
office,'' Walesa said. ``But I would prefer someone else.''
   Walesa also told state TV: ``After we sit down and reach
agreement on deep reforms, then we will find the names (to head the
government) too.''
   He said any Solidarity-led government would guarantee the
sensitive ministries of defense and interior to the communist party
and would do nothing to endanger ``the functioning of the Warsaw
Pact'' military alliance.
   Walesa said a Solidarity coalition would be ``a government of
national responsibility, nominated with respect for the rights of
the Polish president'' _ referring to the constitutional rights of
Jaruzelski to control foreign policy and the armed forces.
   Despite such assurances, the prospect of a Solidarity-led
government has alarmed the communist party and the Soviet Union,
which has said it could destabilize Poland and Europe.
   The party may also fear a Solidarity government would purge the
``nomenklatura'' _ party loyalists who hold tens of thousands of
government and management posts _ and undermine the communist
party's main base of support.
   The Democratic Party, which along with the Peasants holds the
parliamentary balance of power, on Tuesday endorsed Walesa's bid to
form the next government.
   ``We think that we should do everything to realize Lech Walesa's
proposal, which has broad support,'' said the secretariat of the
party, which historically has been allied to the communists.
   Walesa said Aug. 7 that only a government headed by Solidarity
and dominated by non-communists will have the credibility to solve
Poland's political and economic problems
   On the economic front, Kiszczak's caretaker Cabinet said extra
food supplies are to be directed to larger cities, and publicly
owned shops are to be sold or rented to private food vendors.
   Walesa praised Kiszczak's decision to resign, saying it reflected
a ``feeling of responsibility'' and could solve the government
crisis. He said he had nothing personally against Gen. Kiszczak, the
interior minister for eight years.
   The resignation of a communist premier because the opposition
won't endorse him _ as well as the bid by Solidarity to form a
government against the wishes of the Polish and Soviet party
authorities _ demonstrates how radically East bloc politics have
changed. The events would have been unthinkable a year ago.
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the country's Roman Catholic primate, noted
the changes during an annual Assumption Day sermon in Czestochowa.
   ``These events and changes of great significance were made
finally without violence and destruction. ... And we should thank
God for that,'' he said. But he warned the crowd of 150,000 of ``new
concerns,'' including the economy.
   Solidarity began coalition talks Thursday with lamakers from the
two minor parties, which have a combined strength of 103 seats and
hold the balance of power in parliament. Normally obscure and once
regarded as little more than communist fronts, the parties have been
thrown into the role of kingmakers.
   Aleksander Bentkowski, the leader of the Peasant Party's
parliament delegation, said he favors Solidarity's concept for the
next government.
   About a third of the Peasant Party legislators are leaning to
Solidarity and want greater independence from the communists.
Malinowski represents the more traditional, pro-communist wing of
the party that claims 500,000 members.
   Since partially free elections in June, many of the minor-party
lawmakers feel that in order to survive they must distance
themselves from the generally unpopular communists.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Order Strike to Protest Gaza Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The leaders of the anti-Israeli uprising Tuesday
ordered West Bank Palestinians to boycott their jobs in Israel for a
week to protest restrictive new measures imposed on Arabs in the
Gaza Strip.
   The order for a seven-day strike, which would be the longest in
the 20-month-old uprising, came along with a call for ``more stones
and knives'' in fighting Israeli occupation.
   A Palestinian man died Tuesday of a gunshot wound suffered a day
earlier in a clash with soldiers, the army said.
   The death brought to 536 the number of Palestinians killed by
soldiers or Jewish settlers since the uprising began in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis have
been killed.
   Sixteen other Palestinans were reported shot and wounded Tuesday
in confrontations with soldiers in the occupied lands, according to
Arab reports. One of the victims, a 14-year-old girl from the Askar
refugee camp near Nablus, was reported in critical condition with a
bullet in the head.
   The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising said in a
communique that the strike should begin Friday, the day the army
begins enforcing a new rule that requires Gaza Strip Palestinians to
show computerized ID cards to enter Israel.
   Cards are denied anyone considered a security risk.
   More than 50,000 Gazans work in Israel, as do about 60,000
Palestinians from the West Bank.
   The uprising leaders called the cards ``a policy of starvation''
that would deny Arabs work and said West Bank Palestinians who did
not strike in sympathy for those in the Gaza Strip would be
considered ``betrayers.''
   It also called for an escalation of the fight against Israeli
occupation and ordered Palestinians not to meet with Israelis who do
not support the goals of an independent Palestinian state. It said
``anybody who breaks this decision will be outside the national
line.''
   Israeli officials have held a series of meetings with Palestinian
leaders to try to persuade them to accept the government's peace
plan, which calls for elections in the occupied lands but rules out
an independent Palestinian state.
   The 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories closed
their shops and offices Tuesday in response to a strike call by the
Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement.
   Another commercial strike has been called Wednesday by the
underground leadership.
   The Palestinian who died Tuesday was identified by an army
spokeswoman as Ahmed Abdel Khaled Ayub, 23, of the Fara refugee camp
near Nablus.
   The spokeswoman said Ayub was shot in the back Monday when
soldiers opened fire on youths who attacked an army patrol ``at
close range with large stones and concrete blocks.''
   Several thousand camp residents raised Palestinian flags and

<HEAD>Historians Say Secret Pact No Proof of Forced Annexation of Baltics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin made it clear Tuesday that its
acknowledgement of a secret pact with Nazi Germany dividing up
Poland and the Baltic states does not mean it was admitting the
Baltics were forced to join the Soviet Union.
   The latest official view of history and the Molotov-Ribbentrop
pact came in a Foreign Ministry news conference with nine historians
and a ministry spokesman. They said it was perfectly logical for the
Baltics to invite the Red Army onto their territory after the Nazis
invaded Poland.
   The issue is at the heart of a drive by Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia to gain more autonomy _ if not outright independence _ from
the Soviet Union.
   For decades, the Soviet Union denied the existence of the secret
protocols to the non-aggression pact, which was signed by Germany's
Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Soviet Union's Vyacheslav Molotov on
Aug. 23, 1939, one week before the Nazis invaded Poland.
   Microfilm copies in West German archives indicate the protocols
allocated the majority of Poland to Germany's sphere of influence,
and the Baltic states and eastern Poland to the Soviet Union.
   A commission set up by the Soviet parliament in June is expected
to announce any day that it has determined the protocols were
genuine. Members of the commission say the official report will
condemn the protocols and declare them null and void.
   ``The secret protocols said the Baltics were in the sphere of
influence of the Soviet Union,'' agreed historian Mikhail I.
Semryaga at Tuesday's news conference. ``But what does that mean? It
does not mean they were obliged to become part of the Soviet Union.''
   ``I was in the western Ukraine in September 1939,'' said another
historian, Valentin M. Berezhkov, referring to an area that had been
part of Poland and was incorporated into the Soviet Ukraine that
month. ``The population was friendly.''
   Berezhkov also said he thought it was logical for the Baltics to
agree to the establishment of Soviet military bases on their soil
after the Nazis had invaded Poland.
   The historians did show some signs of disagreement when asked if
they were dismissing the testimony of Baltic witnesses to the events
of 1939-40, who say their independent nations were forced to join
the Soviet Union by the occupying Red Army.
   Historian Alexander O. Chubarin said some members of his
profession are reconsidering the standard view that the Baltics
viewed their entrance to the Soviet Union ``with euphoria.''
   Chubarin said he personally believes there were various opinions
among Baltic citizens at the time, and ``the choice was very narrow
in 1940, after the fall of France.''
   ``A lot of people saw the Soviet Union as a good partner,'' he
said. ``They saw the Soviet Union as the embodiment of socialist
principles'' but wound up with Stalinism instead of socialism.
   ``They suffered, as did many other peoples of the Soviet Union,''
Chubarin said.
   On orders from Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, tens of thousands of
Baltic citizens were deported to Siberia and the Far North.
   But another member of the panel, Alexander S. Orlov, said the Red
Army was moderate in its actions in the Baltic and even agreed to
inform local authorities of impending military exercises.
   ``Occupying forces never behaved like that,'' Orlov said.
   Several members of the panel blamed Stalin for the secret pact,
and echoed the conclusion of the commission that the protocols were
illegal because they never were approved by the nominal parliament
of the time.
   Maj. Gen. Viktor I. Filatov, editor of Military History Journal,
argued the protocols ``were just prepared by clerks'' and never
approved.
   But Chubarin did not let that pass. ``Those were not minor clerks
who signed it,'' he said. The German copies of the pact and
accompanying maps show the signatures of Stalin as well as Molotov
and Ribbentrop.
   One member of the parliamentary commission, Latvian I.Y. Kezbers,
said in the newspaper Arguments and Facts this weekend that the pact
showed Stalin's ``imperialist tendencies.''

<HEAD>President Appears Handcuffed in Effort to Rescue Hostages</HEAD>

   He shuffled U.S. warships around the
Mediterranean, sought the help of other nations and offered Iran his
goodwill. But with it all, President Bush appeared on Tuesday to be
handcuffed in his struggle to free the American hostages.
   Two weeks of veiled threats interspersed with indirect offers to
resume normal relations with Tehran have not produced tangible
results. And Bush, responding with evident discomfort to tough
questions at a White House news conference, could neither report
evidence of progress in his multi-layered campaign nor offer a
promising new approach.
   ``We're going to keep on trying,'' was about all he could muster
in the way of a response. ``There's a lot of lines out there, a lot
of initiatives have been taken.''
   And yet, Bush was forced to acknowledge that efforts so far
failed to permit him to provide a ``positive assessment at this
point.''
   His predicament is not unique. President Jimmy Carter tried a
similar range of tactics, and a dramatic helicopter rescue operation
that fell apart in a disabling windstorm in the Iranian desert. And
yet he was unable to liberate the Americans held hostage in Tehran
for 444 days.
   They emerged on his last day in office, Ronald Reagan's
Inauguration Day in 1980.
   As for Reagan, despite his muscular campaign rhetoric, only a
surreptitious transfer of U.S. weapons to Iran _ which caused an
uproar when it became public _ seemed to liberate three Americans.
And others were seized subsequently.
   Bush, rounding out his seventh month in the White House, might
take some comfort in his predecessors' frustrations. But he, too,
has been unable to dent the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which abducted
and apparently killed Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   The factions believed to be holding eight other Americans in
Lebanon present an elusive and perhaps impossible target. They are
mingled in with innocent civilians in slums and camps, and
apparently move the hostages around and about in a crazy-quilt
pattern that defies American surveillance.
   ``If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, private
sector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostages
out or guard against future hostage taking, I would take such
action,'' Bush said.
   But on the military front, at least, the leader of the world's
most powerful nation seems paralyzed.
   ``I'd like to know that what action we took was not going to
victimize a lot of innocent people,'' Bush said. ``When you look at
the action that the United States can take, I don't want to be
responsible for the loss of innocent life.''
   Besides, Bush must weigh the safety of the hostages themselves
and the lives of the Americans sent on a long-shot rescue mission.
   On the diplomatic front, his appeal to the Soviet Union, the Arab
world and other friendly or neutral countries has at least gained
their sympathetic support. But as with Bush's public signal to Iran
last Wednesday that ``goodwill begets goodwill,'' there is no
response from Tehran that portends freeing of the hostages.
   Iran's religious leader issued a flat rejection Monday of Bush's
goodwill gestures and White House hints that direct talks could be
in the offing.
   ``Next to Israel, the usurper regime ruling over occupied
Palestine, you are the most cursed government in the eyes of the
Iranian people,'' the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in slamming that
door shut. ``No one in the Islamic Republic will hold talks with
you.''
   That leaves the legal front.
   Lawyers at the Justice Department have been looking at
anti-terrorist laws to see if a case can be built for extraditing
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the Israeli-held Moslem cleric said by some
to have played a role in Higgins' abduction.
   Presumably, that might touch off a chain of events leading to a
swap for the hostages, as Israel has proposed.
   But Bush was very cool to the idea.
   If there is an indictment, he said, ``I would be remiss if I
didn't try to see him brought to trial.''
   Well, a reporter pressed, could the president take the lead and
encourage the Justice Department to proceed?
   ``I've put it just exactly the way I want to put it,'' Bush said
with a touch of irritation and frustration.
   On Wednesday, with the hostage crisis _ his first real foreign
policy problem _ hanging over him, Bush embarks on a 20-day
vacation. Obviously, he would like to have a solution, or at least
be on the verge of one.
   ``If I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and
bring them out, and that required using the military force of the
United States, make no mistake about it, I would do it in an
instant,'' Bush said.
   But he left the White House podium with every indication that is
not about to happen.

<HEAD>Ignition Test on Shuttle Rocket Motor Called Successful</HEAD>

   Preliminary results show that an ignition
test Tuesday of the space shuttle's redesigned solid rocket motor
was a success, officials at the Marshall Space Flight Center said.
   The center is continuing to test the redesigned engine to check
the performance of joints that were blamed for the 1986 Challenger
explosion, even though the engine is currently used in flights. The
lastest was by Columbia, which returned Sunday from a space voyage.
   The tested rocket motor contained intentional flaws, including a
lack of adhesive on one of the joints and a small hole in another.
But the test worked as predicted with no leaks passing expected
points, said Chuck Vibbart, project manager for the test.
   Further testing on the rocket motor will be done in the next few
days to determine if any possible leaks occurred, officials said.
   The test was the initial one in the second phase of trials of the
redesigned solid rocket motor. Officials expect to conduct several
more years of testing, including some work on the next generation of
rocket motors to be built at a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration site in Iuka, Miss.
   ``We feel that we have tested the redesigned rocket motor
sufficiently to demonstrate its flight readiness,'' Vibbart said
after Tuesday's test. ``But we're also cautious technical engineers
that feel we need to continue to gather data to make sure there are
no surprises lurking out there.''

<HEAD>Gandhi Speaks on Independence Day, 27 Injured by Grenade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi used his
independence day speech Tuesday to attack Parliamentary opponents
and accuse them of slowing the nation's progress.
   Also Tuesday, authorities blamed Pro-Pakistani extremists for a
grenade that injuring 27 people in the city of Srinagar, a popular
tourist resort in the northern Jammu-Kashmir state. Moslem
extremists there are waging a campaign to support Pakistan's claim
to part of the state.
   Gandhi delivered his annual speech amid tight security after
police warned that Sikh militants might launch attacks.
   In his speech, Gandhi attacked ``traitorous forces'' in
Parliament.
   He has accused political groups opposed to his Congress Party of
espousing religious fundamentalism, especially within the country's
majority Hindu faith.
   He is scheduled to call general elections in the next four
months, and he suggested repeatedly these groups are hindering the
nation's development.
   The prime minister was elected to a five-year term in December
1984, two months after his mother and predecessor, Indira Gandhi,
was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.
   Gandhi spoke from the ramparts of the 17th century Red Fort. He
was flanked by foreign diplomats, Cabinet ministers, and senior
government officials.
   Authorities checked for hidden explosives in vehicles arriving
for the ceremony. Visitors were frisked and sent through metal
detectors.
   Gandhi wore a white, bulletproof jacket over a white tunic and
trousers during his speech celebrating Indian independence from
Britain in 1947. A bulletproof glass shield on his podium was
removed minutes before he began his 50-minute speech.
   Police officials said security was strengthened after they
received reports that nine militants had entered the capital for
terrorist attacks.
   Sikh militants in the northern state of Punjab have been fighting
for an independent nation since 1982. They have been blamed for
1,200 killings in Punjab this year and for bomb attacks in New Delhi.
   Tuesday's violence, however, was blamed on Moslem militants who
apparently were trying to enforce a general strike in the Kashmir
Valley of Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Government spokesman Mohammad S. Pandit said 27 people were
injured when a hand grenade exploded at a vegetable market in
Srinagar.
   Pandit said the grenade, thrown at a police jeep, missed and
instead exploded among morning shoppers.
   He said no one was injured in three other bomb attacks around the
area.
   Pandit blamed the attacks on ``Kashmiri militants and
secessionists,'' which are terms used by the government to describe
pro-Pakistani groups.
   Srinagar, a predominantly Moslem city, is about 62 miles west of
the border with Pakistan, which claims part of the state as its own.
   Three Moslem militant groups called the strike in Srinagar to
protest what they said was ``forcible occupation of Kashmir by
India.''

<HEAD>Sinhalese Radicals Enforce One-Day Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinhalese radicals enforced a one-day
general strike Tuesday, the latest in a series to protest the
presence of Indian soldiers trying to end an ethnic civil war.
   Traffic virtually halted in Colombo and other parts of this
island off the tip of India. Most businesses closed.
   Soldiers patrolled the city and policemen stood guard at major
intersections and bus stops.
   Sinhalese militants of the People's Liberation Front, who have
conducted a campaign of strikes and assassination against the
government for two years, had distributed posters warning people to
stay indoors.
   The campaign began after Indian troops were deployed in Sri Lanka
two years ago to try to help end the war involving separatists in
the Tamil minority demanding a homeland in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who has been negotiating with
India for a phased withdrawal of the estimated 43,000 soldiers,
urged people to refrain from violence.
   ``No room should be left for the slightest undermining of the
sovereignty of Sri Lanka,'' he said in a reference to India's
declaration that it would not withdraw while the Tamil insurrection
continues.
   ``Every practical step should be taken to ensure total peace in
the north and east by taking into consideration the realities of the
situation,'' Premadasa said in a statement released by the
government.
   Most Tamil rebel groups laid down their arms, but the largest,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, continued the fight against
the Indian soldiers.
   A military official, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said the Tigers ambushed and killed four Indian soldiers
Tuesday in Morawewa, 145 miles northeast of Colombo.
   At least 1,000 Indians have been killed since they arrived after
the peace accord of July 29, 1987, and the Tamil war has cost 10,000
Sri Lankan lives since it began in 1983.
   The Indians are deployed only in the northeast, where most Tamils
live, but the People's Liberation Front says their presence
compromises Sri Lankan independence. It also claims the accord made
too many concessions to Tamils.
   Premadasa's government blames the Sinhalese radicals for 4,000
killings since June 1987, including at least seven on Tuesday, which
brought the total to 79 in four days.
   Tuesday's strike coincided with the 42nd anniversary of India's
independence from Britain. At least two Colombo dailies refused to
carry special supplements on the occasion, sources at the newspapers
said privately.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese. Most Tamils are
Hindus and Sinhalese are predominantly Buddhist.
   India, an overwhelmingly Hindu nation, became involved because it
is the regional power and 60 million of its people are Tamils.

   Oliver Tambo, president of the African National

a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Tambo, 71, was flown to London Friday for medical tests.
   The exiled South African nationalist leader was was suffering
from exhaustion brought on by a punishing schedule, said Mendi
Msimang, the ANC's chief representative in London, who visited him
Monday night.
   ``He is in good spirits and is being kept fully informed of
developments in South Africa,'' Msimang said.
   He added that Tambo had not suffered a stroke, as sources in the
organization initially were quoted as saying.
   The length of Tambo's stay at the hospital, which was not
identified, has not been determined, Msimang said.
   Tambo, leader since 1967 of the largest guerrilla organization
fighting the white-led government in South Africa, has been in exile
since South Africa banned the ANC in 1960.

<HEAD>Theft of Endangered Turtle Eggs Gets Two-Year Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who repeatedly stole eggs from
the nests of endangered sea turtles was sentenced Tuesday to two
years in prison.
   It is believed to be the longest prison sentence imposed under
the Endangered Species Act, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said in a
statement.
   James Bivins, 37, of West Palm Beach, pleaded guilty in June to
taking 818 green and loggerhead sea turtle eggs from 17 nests on
Jupiter Island Beach in August 1988.
   Six weeks earlier, wildlife officers had caught him poaching
1,088 eggs from a state park in Riviera Beach, the U.S. attorney's
office said. He also had a 1973 turtle egg theft case in which
adjudication was withheld.
   ``By destroying these nests, James Bivins has pushed the
endangered green sea turtles one step closer to extinction,''
Lehtinen said in his sentencing recommendation.
   After Bivins' second arrest, he had agreed to cooperate with
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission officers as an
informant, and cease his nest raids.
   At that time he told them customers paid him up to $15 for a
dozen sea turtle eggs. Some people believe the eggs are an
aphrodisiac, while others buy them for the taste.
   State game officers abandoned Bivins as an informant after his
third arrest.
   U.S. District Judge James C. Paine ordered that Bivins serve two
years in prison, followed by a year's supervised release and three
years of probation.

   A couple kicked off a USAir flight after
an attendant complained they smelled badly are asking the airline
for an apology and the price of two of its most expensive tickets.
   ``Personally, I don't think we smelled any different than anybody
else on the plane,'' Randi Freeman said Tuesday. She claimed the
airline fabricated the accusation as a ploy to regain two seats on
an overbooked flight.
   USAir spokesman Larry Pickett said airline employees followed
company policy in removing Freeman, 27, and her husband, Amir
Omrani, 30, from Flight 252 on July 31. Pickett denied the flight
was overbooked.
   Pickett said the head attendant and gate supervisor told the
couple to leave because their body odor was offensive. He said
passengers also had complained.
   ``If passengers are offending other passengers with their odor or
anything else, we have every right to remove them from the plane,''
he said.
   Freeman said airline employees eventually told the couple that
only Omrani had an offensive body odor, and they gave the couple
toiletries and put them on a later flight.
   ``Nothing changed from the time we got off the first plane until
we got on the next one. My husband washed up and put on my
deodorant, but he didn't take a shower. When we got on the next
flight, I asked a woman sitting next to me if we smelled and she
said no,'' she said.
   Freeman said she has written USAir President Edward Colodny
seeking an apology and $3,528, the cost of first-class round trip
tickets for two from New York to Los Angeles.

   The drop in mortgage interest rates that began
in March is being offset by the prohibitive high cost to first-time
buyers, causing only a ``modest rally'' in sales of existing homes
for the rest of the year, a real estate trade group said Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said the interest rate
declines will result in across-the-board sales increases, but not at
last year's level. Earlier high mortgage rates had caused sales to
fall 3.1 percent in the spring.
   ``Falling rates are likely to trigger only a modest rally,'' said
John A. Tuccillo, NAR chief economist.
   While rates are falling, an NAR survey of 83 metropolitan areas
showed housing costs rising during the second quarter, pricing many
prospective first-time buyers out of the market.
   Twenty-two areas posted median prices above the national median
price of $92,900 during the April-June period, the NAR said.
Forty-three areas recorded an annual median price increase exceeding
the national price increase of 4 percent.
   The median price means that half of the homes sold for more and
half for less.
   The growing range of metropolitan prices indicates that some
area's housing costs have reached a level sufficient to shut out
entry-level buyers indefinitely, said NAR President Ira Gribin.
   The group is urging federal legislation containing help for
first-time buyers including expansion of the Federal Housing
Administration's mortgage insurance program and a down-payment
assistance plan.
   In its report, the NAR said sales of existing homes fell in the
second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.72 million
units. The survey covered sales of single-family detached homes,
town houses, apartment condominiums and co-operatives.
   But mortgate rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent in March, have
fallen since then to 9.96 percent last Friday, according to the
Federal National Mortgage Association.
   Gribin said consumer response lagged the mortgage rate drop but
should be felt in the third quarter.
   ``Now, the people who can afford to get in the market are house
hunting,'' he said.
   Affordability, however, is a problem for many.
   The NAR survey showed that prices of existing homes rose in all
regions during the second quarter. But while the Northeast posted
the slowest increases, it still had the highest median pricetag of
$145,900.
   Elsewhere, prices rose 18.7 percent in the West to a median cost
of $139,700; 4.9 percent in the Midwest to $70,900; and 4.6 percent
in the South to $84,700.
   The San Francisco Bay area was ranked as the most expensive
market, with a $265,700 median price. It was followed by Honolulu,
$262,500; Anaheim-Santa Ana, $247,600; Los Angeles, $218,000; and
Boston, $188,600.

   The State Department said Tuesday it hopes to
conduct an ``active dialogue'' with the new South African leadership
to press for an end to apartheid, and held out the possibility of a
U.S. visit by acting President F.W. de Klerk.
   The department declined comment, however, on the resignation of
President P.W. Botha, calling it an internal South African affair.
   ``We look forward to an active dialogue with the new South
African government as part of our efforts to promote real
negotiations leading to a non-racial democracy in South Africa,''
department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   ``The level of that dialogue will be determined mutually in our
discussions with the new government,'' he said.
   Asked whether de Klerk would be invited to visit by President
George Bush, Boucher said that ``will be determined mutually in our
discussions.''
   De Klerk, who is expected to be elected president in September
balloting, intended to visit the United States this summer and
become the first South African leader to do so in 30 years. But he
postponed his visit, citing a heavy cammpaign schedule, under
pressure from Congress.

   The Agriculture Department has awarded a total
of $200 million to 46 organizations under the Targeted Export
Assistance program for the fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1,
the department announced Tuesday.
   Under TEA, as the program is called, trade associations get funds
to carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products.
The program is aimed at countering or offsetting adverse effects of
unfair foreign trade practices on U.S. exports.
   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their
own money in carrying out specific projects. The amount of those
contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, the agency that oversees
the program.
   The $200 million allocated by USDA is the same as for the current
fiscal year, a level set by Congress in 1989 appropriations
legislation.
   Officials said the 1990 allocations will be finalized after
Congress completes work on next year's appropriations bill.
   The largest amount for next fiscal year was $15.4 million
reserved for Cotton Council International to promote raw cotton in
overseas markets, followed by $12.5 million for the California
Raisin Advisory Board.
   Other leading recipients included: American Soybean Association,
$11.5 million; Florida Department of Citrus, $9.9 million; and the
U.S. Meat Export Federation and the Wine Institute, each with $9
million.

<HEAD>Japanese in Beijing Take Precautions Against Terrorist Threats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Japanese living in Beijing took special
precautions Tuesday against possible attackd by an obscure terrorist
group calling itself the ``Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad.''
   The group had said in death threats received as long as a month
ago that on Tuesday its members would start killing two Japanese
businessmen or tourists a week to retaliate for Japan's ``economic
invasion'' of China.
   The threats, contained in letters sent to Japanese in cities
nationwide, have led hotels and businesses to tighten security,
Japanese businessmen said.
   An official at Japan Air Lines, which received the first threat
in July, said arrangements had been made to improve security at the
Beijing airport.
   ``We haven't done anything special ourselves, but stricter
security measures are being taken by the public security office at
the Beijing airport,'' said Shigeki Suetsugu, a JAL manager.
   Additional plainclothes and uniformed guards were posted at the
Jinglun Hotel, which is popular with Japanese businessmen and where
the airline's ticket and reservations office are located, Suetsugu
said.
   About 230 Japanese businessmen living and working at the Minzu
Hotel in Beijing met with the hotel staff to plan extra security
precautions. The measures included hiring additional guards and
implementing mandatory registration of visitors in the evenings,
said Toshimi Inoue, manager of a trading company operating from
offices in the hotel.
   ``All the hotels are looking out for the Japanese,'' Inoue said.
``Of course we don't really expect anything to happen, but it's
better to take precautions.''
   Japanese Embassy officials said no special measures were planned
beyond earlier warnings to nationals to take precautions such as
varying their routes to work and staying indoors at night.
   As of late Tuesday, no attacks or incidents involving Japanese
nationals had been reported, the embassy said.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said Thursday his
ministry was considering lifting an advisory against non-essential
travel in China. He said the advisory would remain in effect for
Beijing, which has been under martial law since May 20. Martial law
was imposed because of the pro-democracy movement that was crushed
by military forces on June 3-4.
   Most of the Japanese living in China left following the military
suppression of the student-led movement. Airline employees said
virtually no Japanese tourists are traveling to China, but most
Japanese businessmen have returned to their jobs.
   ``We're just going ahead with our work as usual,'' said Kenji
Ishii of the Japan Association for Promotion of International Trade.
   ``You can't spend all day worrying. After all, there are
extremists in Japan, too.'' Said Inoue, who has managed a trading
firm in Beijing for four years.
   ``The protests last spring seem to have brought some of those
groups out into the open here in China, too,'' he said, referring to
organizations such as the Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad.
   Some Japanese say the threats have cast a pall over living and
working in China.
   ``We don't expect anything to happen, but the threats make it
impossible for us to move around freely. It makes life here rather
grim,'' said JAL's Suetsugu. ``It would be a lie to say I'm not
worried. It's creepy.''

   A man pleaded innocent by reason of insanity
Tuesday to charges that he set his pregnant daughter on fire during
an argument.
   Joseph Richmond of Akron entered the plea before Summit County
Common Pleas Judge Glen B. Morgan, who ordered psychiatric tests and
set a Sept. 12 trial.
   Richmond, 41, has been indicted on felonious assault, child
endangering, and aggravated arson. Authorities said that on July 24,
he doused his 17-year-old daughter, Kimberly Richmond, with brake
fluid and set her on fire.
   The woman gave birth by Caesarean section to a baby girl after
she received third-degree burns over 70 percent of her body.
   The victim remained in serious condition Tuesday at Children's
Hospital Medical Center of Akron, said hospital spokeswoman Carol
Wallace. The woman regained consciousness and was taken off a
respirator Aug. 1.
   The baby has been released from the hospital in the custody of
her maternal grandmother, Ms. Wallace said.

<TEXT>
   Eighteen rockets hit Kabul's airport
and residential areas Tuesday, killing and wounding some civilians,
the government said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said there were
civilian casualties but he had no figures. He said there were no
casualties at the airport but sources there said a soldier was
wounded.
   An airport official, speaking with the condition he not be
identified, said nine rockets hit the airport and did minor damage
to the runway. Amani said only three rockets hit the airport and the
runway was ``not damaged even slightly.''
   Reporters trying to enter the airport were turned away by
security guards.
   Moslem guerrillas, who began fighting the government after a
communist coup in April 1978, control most of the countryside around
Kabul and other cities. Soviet military forces entered the war in
December 1979, but completed a U.N.-mediated withdrawal Feb. 15.
   Amani said rockets destroyed two houses about half a mile from
the airport and others hit a bus station and shopping center.
   The airport sources said several rockets landed in front of and
behind the main passenger terminal of the civilian section during
the busy morning hours when several flights were arriving and
departing. No information was available on damage or casualties in
the military section.
   All passengers in the terminal were safe but departing flights
were delayed, one airport official said.
   Amani said 299 rockets have hit the city in four weeks, killing
188 civilians and injuring 483, not counting casualties from
Tuesday's attacks.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday endorsed complaints
made by Budget Director Richard Darman that the Federal Reserve was
keeping interest rates so high that the central bank was impeding
economic growth.
   ``I don't know of any president, now or in the past, who doesn't
favor lower interest rates,'' Bush said in response to a question at
a news conference.
   ``I can feel very comfortable with his (Darman's) sallying forth
and saying that,'' Bush said. ``I think I've said essentially the
same thing in the past.''
   Darman on Sunday criticized the Federal Reserve for pursuing
interest rate policies which he said could be pushing the country
toward a recession. He said the central bank should ease credit
further to keep the 6{-year-old economic expansion alive.
   Darman said that if the country does suffer a recession it will
be because the Fed ``erred on the side of caution'' in keeping
interest rates high in an effort to guard against inflation.
   Bush sidestepped a question on whether he agreed with Darman's
assessment on who would bear the blame for a recession, saying he
would take that question ``under advisement.''

<HEAD>Opening of Wallenberg Files Raises Hopes of Solving Mystery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet offer to open files on Raoul
Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat missing since World War II, has
raised hopes of unraveling the mystery about his fate. But an
official in Moscow said Tuesday the material will show Wallenberg is
dead.
   Wallenberg, who was credited with saving tens of thousands of
Jews from Nazi concentration camps, vanished after his arrest by
Soviet troops entering Budapest, Hungary, in January 1945.
   The Soviets say files discovered in 1957 showed Wallenberg, who
would be 77 today, died of a heart attack in prison 30 months after
his arrest. But Soviet dissident sources have reported seeing the
Swedish diplomat in labor camps during this decade.
   The Stockholm-based Raoul Wallenberg Association said Monday it
has been invited to send a four-member delegation, including
Wallenberg's closest relatives, to Moscow for talks on his
disappearance.
   The group is to travel to Moscow in mid-October.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh
said Wallenberg's relatives ``probably will have the opportunity to
acquaint themselves with all the materials we have on the Wallenberg
case, including the materials on his death in 1946.''
   There was no explanation for Gremitskikh's reference to 1946 for
Wallenberg's death, given previously as July 1947.
   Wallenberg issued Swedish passports to 20,000 Hungarian Jews
slated for Nazi death camps. His intervention with German
authorities was credited for the survival of another 100,000
Hungarian Jews.
   The Soviets never explained why he was arrested but many
historians believe he he was mistaken for an American spy.

   Half a year after renewing its lease on the

over the Democrats, according to a report Tuesday by the Federal
Election Commission.
   During the first six months of the year, the national committees
of the Republican Party raised a total of more than $45 million,
while the Democrats raised just $8.9 million, the report said.
   In the same period, Republicans also outspent the Democrats $36.4

   The Republicans have held similar financial advantages in the
comparable periods following the 1984 and 1986 elections, the

   President Bush urged the official watchdogs for
all federal departments and agencies Tuesday to help him fulfill his
commitment to ``the highest ethical standards in government.''
   Bush told the inspectors general in a memo he was relying ``on
your vigilance to help me honor that commitment.''
   Bush has sent Congress legislation that would revamp the federal
ethics law and ban receipt of honoraria by members of Congress.
   ``Even with adoption of these measures, I realize how much our
system of ethical standards will still depend on the work of
individuals,'' including ``specialists like you who devote their
careers to the maintenance of high standards,'' Bush wrote the
inspectors general, whom he met with in January shortly after his
inauguration.
   He made no mention of the influence-peddling scandal at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development now under investigation
as a result of an inspector general's report.
   But Bush said:
   ``Your careful monitoring of agency activities and your diligence
in investigating possible improprieties is essential both in
ensuring that employees adhere to scrupulous standards and ...
seeing that justice is done when employees fall short of proper
conduct.''

<HEAD>Investigators Search For Clues In Crash That Killed Congressman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators hauled twisted
portions of a light plane to Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi
Tuesday in hopes of determining what caused a crash that killed Rep.
Larkin Smith and his pilot.
   ``So far we don't have any significant findings. The wreckage is
being removed for further examination,'' George Prellezo, regional
director for the National Transportation Safety Board, said from
Miami.
   ``The preliminary examination did not reveal anything
significant. So basically we don't have anything to suggest what may
have caused the crash.''
   Searchers on Monday found the body of Smith, 45, along with that
of pilot Chuck Vierling, 58. Authorities said the pair's
single-engine Cessna 177 crashed about 9:30 p.m. Sunday into a dense
south Mississippi forest.
   Smith, a freshman Republican from Mississippi's 5th District,
threw out the first pitch in a youth baseball tournament in
Hattiesburg and was returning to his home in Gulfport, a Gulf Coast
city about 70 miles to the south.
   Prellezo said volunteers from Keesler used a path cut by a
bulldozer during the search to remove wreckage.
   A Perry County Sheriff's Department deputy, who declined to give
his name, said no portions of the plane were found intact.
   Prellezo said an NTSB investigator was being assisted by about
five other people, including personnel from the Federal Aviation
Administration and the aircraft's manufacturer.
   He said they were interviewing witnesses and would examine the
plane's engine. Nothing about the positioning of the crash debris
offered any clues about its cause, Prellezo said.
   ``There was nothing significant about the wreckage itself,
nothing strange, nothing extraordinary,'' he said.
   There was no indication that foul play had been involved in the
crash, but it had not been ruled out, Perry County Sheriff Carlos
Herring said.
   But Prellezo said, ``We have no reason to suspect foul play at
this point.''
   Officials say the plane apparently clipped a 70-foot-tall pine
tree and disintegrated on impact.
   Smith will be mourned at a two-day public memorial Wednesday and
Thursday at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum and Convention Center in
Biloxi, officials said.
   The gray-haired former sheriff and police chief went to
Washington with a hard-line stance against crime gained in 22 years
of law enforcement experience and quickly impressed colleagues with
his knowledge of the law.
   Smith won a position on the House Judiciary Committee, breaking a
Republican tradition of appointing only lawyers to the panel.
   ``Because of his background and hard-working manner he gave every
indication of becoming a star,'' said Alan Coffey, chief Republican
counsel for the Judiciary Committee.
   ``I'm just absolutely heartsick to lose somebody like (Smith),''
said Gov. Ray Mabus, who ordered state flags flown at half staff.
``Our hearts and prayers go out to his family. He and I were real
good friends, even though we were in different (political) parties.
He was easy to work with.''
   Smith was the second congressman in as many weeks to die in a
plane crash. Earlier Sunday, the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep.
Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and 15 other people were found in Ethiopia
with no survivors. That plane disappeared Aug. 7 on a flight to a
remote village.
   Smith's survivors include his wife, Sheila, a daughter, Tracy,
and a grandson.

<TEXT>
   The prosecution in the tax evasion and extortion
trial of hotel queen Leona Helmsley rested its case Tuesday after
six weeks of testimony in which former employees called her a
penny-pinching tyrant.
   But even before the last witness had completed his testimony,
attention was focused on the defense presentation.
   At issue is an accounting report that claims Mrs. Helmsley and
her husband, Harry, are actually owed $681,000 in tax refunds during
1983-85, the years charged in the indictment.
   In arguments at the start of the day, Assistant U.S. Attorney
James DeVita said defense attorneys had given him a copy of the
report Monday afternoon. He complained to U.S. District Judge John
Walker that the rules of evidence mandate that the defense turn over
such documents at a much earlier date.
   Walker, who appeared upset at the development, admonished Mrs.
Helmsley's attorney, Gerald Feffer.
   ``I am extremely disappointed in defense counsel for not
furnishing this earlier,'' Walker said. ``To me, it is inexcusable
and I can't understand why it didn't happen.''
   Walker said that if he allows the report to be admitted into
evidence, the trial could take a month longer than expected because
the government would need to rebut its conclusions.
   The judge also indicated that he may grant the government a delay
to review the report and its underlying documents. If he does this,
the trial could continue into September.
   He reserved his decision on whether to admit the report into
evidence.
   The government ``needs to have absolute and complete disclosure
of every aspect of this offer of proof,'' Walker said. ``That
includes finding out from the accountants when they were retained,
what they had to say and what the basis is for their testimony.''
   The report itself has not yet been made public. But Feffer and
another lawyer for Mrs. Helmsley, James A. Bruton III, have
described it during arguments.
   They said two outside accounting firms reviewed the tax returns
of several Helmsley-owned partnerships from 1983-85 and found that
the accountants who prepared the returns had incorrectly calculated
the depreciation of property.
   These alleged oversights, the lawyers claim, resulted in an
overstatement of the Helmsleys' personal income.
   Bruton said the report concluded that the Helmsleys overpaid
$90,000 in taxes in 1983, $13,000 in 1984 and $578,000 in 1985.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is charged with evading about $1 million in
federal taxes by charging about $4 million in personal expenses to
Helmsley-owned businesses. Two former aides, Frank Turco and Joseph
Licari, are being tried for assisting in the scheme.
   Mrs. Helmsley and Turco are additionally charged with conspiracy
to extort payoffs and merchandise from vendors doing business with
the Helmsley organization.
   Mrs. Helmsley's husband, Harry, 80, was also charged but was
severed from the trial for health reasons.
   The last of 42 witnesses to testify was Gus Lesnevich, a
handwriting expert hired by the prosecution to review invoices,
memorandums and other documents submitted during the trial.
   Lesnevich identified the initials and writing of Mrs. Helmsley
and her co-defendants on the documents.
   When DeVita stood and said the government had rested its case,
Mrs. Helmsley smiled and appeared relieved.
   Previous witnesses had portrayed Mrs. Helmsley as an abusive boss
who sometimes forced suppliers to charge her personal expenses to
her business. Even her attorney conceded that she was ``demanding''
and ``abrasive.''

<HEAD>Cuomo Tries to Sell Bush on Anti-Shoreham Position</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo tried and failed
Tuesday to change the federal mind and win presidential approval for
his plan to dismantle a new nuclear power plant.
   ``I don't think anything was done to change the governor's mind.
I don't think anything was done to change the president's mind,''
Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said outside the White House.
   ``We haven't seen anything new in the information the governor
gave us.''
   President Bush, Moore, White House chief of staff John Sununu and
Bush aide Andrew Card met with Cuomo for nearly an hour Tuesday
after Cuomo said he wanted to see the president personally to make
his case for dismantling, rather than mothballing, the Shoreham
plant 50 miles east of New York City on Long Island's northern shore.
   Cuomo left the president with a 2-inch-thick binder of
information on Shoreham and a list of 10 questions he would like the
administration to answer about Shoreham and nuclear energy. The
questions generally expressed great skepticism about the feasibility
of mothablling the plant.
   ``We left it that the (administration's) energy planners would
talk to my planners, that the president would ask people at Energy
and presumably his staff as well to read the book, to read the 10
questions, and to get back to us with answers,'' Cuomo said. ``He
was precise about saying that we were entitled to answers and we
would get answers.''
   The governor declined to characterize Bush's reaction to the
presentation, but said it was a positive sign that the president had
even agreed to the meeting.
   Cuomo said the federal government's attempt to derail the tearing
down of the Long Island nuclear power plant amounted to usurpation
of state's rights.
   ``The Department of Energy is presuming to tell the state of New
York what plants it can build, whether or not it should mothball the
plants, whether or not it needs environmental impact statements,''
he said. ``There's no such authority in the Department of Energy,
nor has anybody ever attempted anything like that in all the years
of this federal government.''
   But Moore disagreed, calling Cuomo's argument ``a red herring.''
   ``The Congress has charged the Department of Energy with
fashioning a national energy policy,'' he said. ``The law says that
we're supposed to speak up, we're supposed to make decisions, we're
supposed to do what we can to see to it that the American people
have affordable energy and have the supplies of it that they need.''
   The Energy Department argues that the 813 megawatts that Shoreham
can produce are needed to ease possible power shortgaes in the
Northeast, and that replacement power would mean burning more
environmentally harmful fossil fuels.
   Cuomo asked in July for a meeting with Bush after White House
chief of staff Sununu said the plant should be mothballed, not
dismantled.
   ``We want to wait for the people of Long Island to realize that
the plant is needed,'' Sununu said in an interview with Newsday, a
Long Island newspaper.
   Cuomo said at the time he did not expect to be granted an
audience with the president because it would put Bush in the
embarrassing position of admitting he was ill-informed. But at a
meeting of the National Governors Association in Chicago earlier
this month, Bush told Cuomo they could get together.
   The federal-state debate over Shoreham's fate has been running
since Bush appointed Sununu and Energy Secretary James Watkins, both
of whom have been strongly pro-nuclear and pro-Shoreham.
   The Democratic governor blasted the administration for its
``unjustified and arrogant interference'' in trying to block a
shutdown settlement negotiated between the state and the Long Island
Lighting Co., which built Shoreham. The state has long maintained
that the area around Shoreham could not be safely evacuated in the
event of a nuclear accident.
   Under the settlement, the state will buy the $5.5 billion plant
for $1 and have it dismantled at the company's expense. In return,
the company has been guaranteed annual rate increases of about 5
percent for at least a decade. Long Island homeowners and businesses
already pay the highest electricity rates in the country.
   Although the deal has been approved by various state agencies and
company stockholders, the Department of Energy has said it would
seek to prevent it from going through by opposing transfer of
Shoreham's license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must approve
the transfer, and the department has tried to slow that process by
asking the commission to order its own environmental review of the
impact of closing Shoreham and freeze staffing there.
   Last week, the Energy Department also joined a private lawsuit
that challenges the Shoreham shutdown on environmental grounds.

   Watergate figure G. Gordon Liddy says he
isn't worried about being typecast as a bad guy.
   In the early 1970s, the former Nixon aide concocted a campaign of
dirty tricks against Democratic presidential candidates and
masterminded the break-in at the Watergate headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee.
   Liddy, 58, was in Tacoma recently filming ``Nowhere Man,'' in
which he plays a character who fakes his death as part of a scheme
to throw the cops off his trail so he can make a huge drug score.
   The sordid role suits him fine, Liddy said.
   ``If you are seen by producers, directors and casting people as a
credible villain, you're fortunate indeed, because we waste a
villain a week on every show,'' he said speaking of television and
movies in general. ``It's a big market for villains, a far bigger
market than for the guy with the capped teeth who gets the girl.''
   In another, as-yet-unreleased movie, ``Street Asylum,'' Liddy
says he plays ``a corrupt megalomaniac, a former police official now
running for mayor who has formed a sinister alliance with a female
mad scientist.
   ``I am also a sexual pervert,'' he says of the role. ``There's
absolutely no redeeming social value whatsoever in that character.''
   Liddy says his wife agrees he fits the mold.
   ``Mrs. Liddy says, `You don't have to act,''' Liddy said. `` `You
just go up there and be yourself, and you're the perfect villain.'''

<HEAD>Rebels Attack Police Academy with Mortars, Rockets, Bombs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL ESPINO, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels attacked a newly
built police academy Tuesday with mortars, rockets, dynamite bombs
and rifle fire, wounding two policemen and five cadets, authorities
reported.
   The attack, which began with a mortar barrage early Tuesday,
awakened residents in El Espino, located just west of San Salvador,
and two nearby communities.
   A rebel spokesman telephoned local radio stations and said 25
guerrillas carried out the assault. He gave no report of rebel
casualties.
   He said the raid was part of an offensive he called ``The armed
struggle for democracy will not be detained.'' He read a communique
that said the academy, where several hundred recruits are trained,
was turning out ``agents of repression.''
   The armed forces press office said several buildings in the
complex were damaged.
   An army helicopter gunship arrived shortly after the attack began
and illuminated the area with dozens of red flares.
   As they withdrew the guerrillas left mines that were removed by
bomb-disposal teams.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front have
been fighting since 1980 to overthrow the government. It is
estimated that about 70,000 people have been killed in the war.
   Both the 11-week-old rightist government of President Alfredo
Cristiani and the rebels have indicated a willingness to begin
negotiations on ending the conflict but no peace talks are scheduled.

<TEXT>
   Authorities on Tuesday recovered the
bodies of all 16 people killed in the crash of a plane carrying a
U.S. congressional delegation headed by Rep. Mickey Leland.
   A helicopter hovered near the face of a sheer cliff in
southwestern Ethiopia as the bodies were hoisted up one by one from
the rugged mountainside where the twin-engine plane crashed last
week.
   They were flown to the nearby town of Gambela and placed aboard
an Ethiopian air force C-130 cargo plane for the return to Addis
Ababa.
   ``We've got them all,'' Air Force Capt. Kevin Krejarck said upon
his return to the capital from Gambela. ``The site has now been
cleared.
   ``The weather gave us a break today,'' Krejarck said. ``It was
sunny down there for the first time in days.''
   The effort to retrieve the bodies of Leland, who headed the House
Select Committee on Hunger, and his companions was stalled Monday by
low clouds, rain and fog that shrouded the mountain, which is called
Tam.
   About 50 American and Ethiopian personnel were able to reach the
site Tuesday, said James Haley, chief spokesman for the U.S. Embassy
in Addis Ababa.
   The recovery teams were lowered to the base of the cliff by
helicopters, then had to scale it to reach the wreckage and bodies,
Krejarck said.
   A team of Air Force investigators arrived from Washington to work
with Ethiopian authorities to determine the cause of the accident.
The team included representatives of the U.S. Civil Aviation
Authority, and the Boeing and Pratt and Whitney companies, which
made the body and engines of Leland's chartered Twin Otter.
   Marine Lt. Col. David Titus said the bodies would be identified
in Addis Ababa by a team of U.S. forensic experts, a process he said
could take up to a week.
   Funeral and memorial service plans for Leland were announced in
Houston. A memorial service is to be held at 7:30 p.m. Friday at
Hannah Hall Auditorium on the Texas Southern University campus. Mass
will be said at 10 a.m. Saturday at St. Anne's Catholic Church in
Houston.
   There will be a private burial at a later date.
   In addition to Leland, there were eight other Americans and seven
Ethiopians aboard the twin-engine plane which disappeared in bad
weather on Aug. 7 en route to the Fugnido refugee camp, about 350
miles southwest of the capital, near the Ethiopian-Sudanese border.
   Heavy clouds, rain and low visibility were believed to have led
to the crash of the aircraft, which slammed into the 5,500-foot
mountain about 100 miles from the refugee camp.
   After a six-day search, rescuers Sunday found the wreckage and
bodies strewn over about a quarter-mile wide region of the
mountain's severe slopes.
   A four-man congressional delegation planned to fly to Ethiopia to
escort the bodies home but officials have said they will not leave
Washington until the bodies have been identified.
   Leland, a 44-year-old Texas Democrat, was on his sixth visit to
Africa and his second this year when the plane crashed en route to
the refugee camp, one of four in southwestern Ethiopia run by the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees that holds more than 300,000
Sudanese fleeing war and famine in their neighboring country.

<HEAD>Jordan Schedules First Elections for Parliament in 22 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jordan's first general parliamentary
elections in 22 years will be held Nov. 8, Prime Minister Zeid Bin
Shaker said Tuesday.
   His announcement, carried by the official Jordan News Agency,
said the date was set by the 26-member Cabinet in accordance with
King Hussein's election decree earlier this month.
   Interior Minister Salem Massadeh said about 1,400 candidates
would run for a parliament of 80 seats and candidate registration
would start Saturday.
   A ban on political parties, in effect since a coup attempt in
1957, remains in force so candidates will run as individuals
although they can be members of political organizations.
   Massadeh said more than a million voters registered in a 15-day
period that ended Tuesday. About 1.2 Jordanians are eligible to vote.
   He said committees would begin examining the registration lists
Wednesday and the procedure would take a week.
   Since the early 1950s, parliaments have been evenly divided
between the east and west banks of the Jordan River, but voting on
both banks has not been possible since Israel captured the West Bank
in the 1967 Middle East war. A few district elections were held in
1984 to replace lawmakers who had died.
   King Hussein suspended the old 60-member parliament last year
after relinquishing sovereignty over the West Bank to the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Election of the mew parliamewnt solely from
Jordan will help seal the country's separation from the
Israeli-occupied territory.
   The king approved a law April 17 calling for a 72-member body
representing only the East Bank. After four days of rioting over
price increases later that month he promised elections by the end of
the year.
   Political activists said the April election law did not
distribute seats fairly according to population and it was amended
in July to add eight seats for major population centers.

<HEAD>Researchers Enlist Tiny Wasp in Lyme Disease Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wasp no bigger than the dot of an ``i''
could play a big role in the fight against Lyme disease following
its rediscovery by a victim of the ailment who was searching through
old newspaper files.
   The state on Tuesday awarded a $15,000 grant to the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst to collect chalcid wasps, reproduce them
and eventually let them loose on the deer tick that carries Lyme
disease.
   ``There's very exciting possibilities there for some control of
the problem that has really panicked some people who summer here,''
said William Wilcox, senior county agriculture agent for Martha's
Vineyard and Nantucket.
   ``We need more information, but it looks like there's potential
there,'' said Roy Van Driesche, an entomology professor involved in
the project.
   The minuscule wasp took on new prominence after a member of the
Martha's Vineyard Lyme Disease Action Committee ``started to poke
around in the Vineyard Gazette files,'' Wilcox said.
   Burton Engley, a 76-year-old Martha's Vineyard resident who had
suffered two mild cases of Lyme disease, said he was trying to track
down reports of an experiment he recalled from the 1920s.
   He found a 1937 article that reported a 1926 experiment in which
chalcid wasps from Europe were released on the island to kill dog
and wood ticks. That fit with a 1985 study that found the wasp's
eggs had infested and were killing nearly 27 percent of the deer
ticks on the island.
   ``It's just a lucky break actually that it worked out that way,''
Wilcox said.
   Local health officials then contacted the University of
Massachusetts' Applied Biological Control Program to explore the
possibility of using the chalcid wasps for disease control.
   Lyme Disease, named for the Connecticut town where it was first
documented in 1975, can cause rashes, headaches and sore muscles,
and, if not detected early, arthritis and heart irregularities. It
can be treated with antibiotics.
   Between 5,000 and 8,000 cases of Lyme Disease are reported
nationally each year, and 350 cases have been documented in
Massachusetts since officials began documenting the disease in 1985,
said Paul Etkind, state epidemiologist.
   ``If this works, it could maybe reduce incidents by 35 percent,''
said August Schumacher Jr., commissioner of food and agriculture.
``That's 100 cases.''
   The chalcid kills ticks by using a needle-like appendage to
insert eggs inside the host. As the eggs develop, they kill the
tick. The wasp also may help inhibit immature ticks from spreading
the disease, health officials said.
   Researchers hope to begin work soon at a field station on
Nantucket, Van Driesche said.
   If the wasps prove effective, state officials hope to have them
commercially bred and used in conjunction with the current burning
techniques and pesticides.
   ``It could be part of spring in Massachusetts would be releasing
a box of these bugs,'' Schumacher said.

   Drug czar William J. Bennett sounded a
distinctly negative note Tuesday about the nostalgia that has welled
up around the 20th anniversary of Woodstock.
   Bennett emerged from a White House meeting on anti-drug strategy
with President Bush to complain about ``memory distortion'' going on
about the rock concert in upstate New York that captivated a
generation in 1969.
   The 45-year-old Bennett, a onetime guitar player and fan of early
rock 'n' roll, recited what he called ``the casualty list from
Woodstock'': rock performers, including singer Janis Joplin, who
died in later years from drug overdoses.
   Bennett, who as a graduate student at the University of Texas in
the late 1960s had a blind date with Joplin, complained about the
torrent of publicity marking the anniversary of the three-day
counterculture festival.
   He said ``part of the legacy of Woodstock was tolerance of drugs
and let us be glad that is over rather than wishing it were back. We
do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs. We've come too
far.''
   People ``have been hearing today and probably will hear ad
nauseam over the next couple of days fond memories and nostalgia
about Woodstock, and there's a lot of memory distortion going on,''
he said.
   ``The next time you hear somebody gushing about Woodstock and
`Why can't it be that way today?' remind them of the casualty list
from Woodstock.
   ``In order of performance:
   ``_Janis Joplin, who died in 1970 of a drug overdose;
   ``_Jimi Hendrix, dead, 1970 drug overdose;
   ``_Keith Moon of the Who, dead of a drug overdose in '78;
   ``_Paul Butterfield Blues Band _ Butterfield died of a drug
overdose in '87.
   ``Woodstock was a time of a great deal of tolerance for drug use
and it was also a time of a great deal of death, because of the
tolerance of drugs,'' said Bennett.

   France said Tuesday it is sending a destroyer to the
eastern Mediterranean to be in a position to aid French citizens in
Lebanon while pursuing diplomatic actions aimed at a cease-fire in
the civil war.
   Premier Michel Rocard's office said the 5,000-ton destroyer
Duquesne, equipped with surface-to-air Exocet missiles, was ordered
out of port early Tuesday.
   The statement said France also was ``pursuing and intensifying
her diplomatic actions in nearby concerned capitals and with
international organizations to achieve an immediate halt in the
fighting'' in Lebanon.
   It said the destroyer was being sent to provide ``all assistance
that could be asked and to be in a position to aid the French
community.'' The statement noted that the French ambassador's
residence in Beirut has been hit several times during the artillery
duels between Lebanese Christian and Syrian forces.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas has spoken with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar several times recently on
the Lebanese conflict and sent Thierry de Beauce, secretary of state
for international cultural relations, to capitals throughout the
Middle East.
   About 7,000 French citizens live in Beirut and 85 percent have
dual nationality, the Foreign Ministry said. Six hundred French
soldiers serve with the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
   France administered Lebanon for 20 years, withdrawing in 1943,
and has been active in seeking a solution to the 14-year-old
sectarian civil war.

   A man sought in the death of a ``Night
Stalker'' trial juror committed suicide Tuesday and admitted in a
note to killing the juror during a domestic dispute, authorities
said.
   Hours earlier, Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan sent the jury
home to recover from the shock of Phyllis Singletary's death. Tynan
said he hoped the jury could resume deliberations Wednesday, and
lawyers for both sides said they wanted to avert a mistrial in the
year-old trial.
   James Cecil Melton, 51, shot himself in the head at 10:30 a.m. at
a motel in suburban Carson after sheriff's deputies received an
anonymous phone tip that he was there, said Deputy Bill Wehner.
   ``He came out of his room onto the balcony, put a fully loaded
unidentified caliber handgun to his head, and shot himself,'' said
Wehner. ``He died at the scene.''
   Melton had been sought for questioning in the killing of
Singletary, 30, his live-in girlfriend, who was shot at the couple's
Carson home, Wehner said.
   In a note, Melton admitted killing Ms. Singletary in a domestic
dispute, but the note did not elaborate, the deputy said.
   Defense and prosecution lawyers said they believed the jury, with
an alternate replacing Ms. Singletary, could continue working toward
verdicts on the serial murder charges against Richard Ramirez.
   Ramirez, 29, a drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged with 13
counts of murder and 30 other felonies. Prosecutors contend Ramirez
is the devil-worshiping ``Night Stalker'' who raped, robbed and
murdered victims in a 1985 rampage that terrorized Southern
California.
   ``Mr. Ramirez doesn't want a mistrial. He wants to go forward,''
said attorney Ray Clark. ``He's like the rest of us. Nobody's happy
about this. It's a very sad thing.''
   Some of the jurors were in tears as they arrived in court Tuesday.
   ``I think there is a tear in the eyes of a lot of us,'' Tynan
told the panel. But he stressed that Ms. Singletary's slaying ``had
nothing to do with this case.''
   Ms. Singletary's battered body was found Monday after she had
failed to show up for jury deliberations that morning. Wehner said
she had been beaten before she was shot many times.
   Neighbors told police the couple had fought over the weekend and
one woman said she heard gunshots.
   The judge selected an alternate to replace Ms. Singletary.
   ``It is tragic,'' the judge said. ``But what happened to her does
not add or diminish to the evidence of whether Mr. Ramirez is guilty
or innocent.
   ``I do not mean to be callous,'' he said, ``but we have business
to do.''
   He recessed court for the day.
   ``I think we all have been terribly affected,'' he said.
   It was the second time in five days that a deliberating juror had
to be replaced. On Friday, a juror was dismissed for sleeping during
the talks and an alternate was substituted.
   In addition to the 12 regular jurors seated from the beginning of
the trial, 12 alternates were chosen. As of Tuesday, five had been
sent in as regular jurors.

   Showers and thunderstorms dampened the East Coast, portions of
the Great Lakes region and the central Plains on Tuesday, while the
rest of the nation enjoyed fair skies.
   Precipitation was most widespread along the middle and south
Atlantic Coast, Georgia, Alabama and the southern Appalachians.
   Half an inch to an inch of rain fell during a two-hour period in
Knox County, Ky. A thunderstorm produced a half-inch of rain in 30
minutes at Springfield, Vt.
   Strong thunderstorms were expected over portions of the lower
Great Lakes and over parts of Montana and northern Wyoming. Pea-size
hail struck Flint, Mich.
   Locally heavy rain fell on portions of the central Plains as an
upper level disturbance and a slow moving cold front produced
thunderstorms over central Nebraska and northern Kansas. Two inches
of rain accumulated in central Nebraska.
   Afternoon temperatures were mostly in the upper 60s and 70s in
Michigan, the upper Mississippi Valley, the northern Great Plains
and the northern Rockies. Readings were in the lower 60s in upper
Michigan, northern lower Michigan and northern Wisconsin.
   Most of the eastern United States had temperatures in the 80s,
with a few 90s near the Gulf Coast.
   There were also a few readings in the 90s over Utah and interior
valleys of California, with temperatures over the 100-degree mark in
the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 105 degrees at Needles, Calif. The
nation's low was 29 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms in the East Coast states, the Appalachians, the Ohio
and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf Coast states, the northern Rockies
and the northern High Plains.
   Widely scattered thunderstorms were expected in the mountains of
the Southwest.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s and lower 90s across
most of the nation. Highs were forecast in the 70s in Maine, the
Great Lakes region, the northern Rockies, Washington state and the
Pacific Coast.
   Readings were to reach the upper 90s in parts of Utah and Nevada,
near 105 degrees in the interior valleys of California and near 110
degrees in the desert Southwest.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Namibia's administrator on Tuesday
ordered that 1,200 policemen who had served in a paramilitary unit
be confined to their bases for retraining.
   Adminstrator-general Louis Pienaar said the policemen had been
members of a disbanded counter-insurgency group known as
``Koevoet,'' the Afrikaans-language word for ``crowbar.''
   He said the action was designed to ease tensions as the
territory, also known as South-West Africa, heads toward
independence.
   Pienaar said the relative calm in Namibia allowed the policemen
to be ``confined to bases where they will undergo reorientation and
retraining to equip them for roles that are to be redefined.''
   ``If the situation should in any way deteriorate ... I shall
consider the steps that would need to be taken in order to restore
law and order,'' he added.
   United Nations officials, including Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, had said that former Koevoet members were
intimidating civilians in northern Namibia and should be removed
from the 6,000-member Namibian police force.
   U.N. military and civilian personnel are in Namibia to monitor
the transition to independence. The territory has been administered
by South Africa since World War I under a mandate from the defunct
League of Nations.
   Koevoet squads played a leading role in the South African-led
security forces battle against guerrillas of the South-West Africa
People's Organization (SWAO).
   Most Koevoet members were black Namibians. Some civilians accused
the unit of brutality and atrocities. It was disbanded in January.
   Many ex-Koevoet members have been integrated into the regular
police force. Pienaar had argued the ex-Koevoet fighters were needed
to guard against possible attacks by SWAPO guerrillas.
   Under a U.N.-backed regional peace accord, South Africa agreed to
free the territory beginning April 1. But on that date, some 1,000
SWAPO guerrillas crossed into northern Namibia from southern Angola,
setting off three weeks of fighting that threatened to derail the
independence plan.
   But the peace process is back on track and SWAPO is favored to
win pre-independence elections in November.
   Pienaar said he decided to confine the ex-Koevoet members to the
bases after U.N. officials assured him that the threat of a SWAPO
attack had subsided.

   President Bush on Tuesday promised a
``balanced, decisive, effective and achievable'' national drug plan,
backed by more federal money, to meet Americans' demand for action.
   He declined to say where the money would come from ``because the
final decisions haven't been made.''
   Bush said he would not raise taxes, ``but we are going to expand
federal expenditures.'' He added, ``We will have to do some
reallocation of resources.''
   Bush focused on the anti-drug campaign on his last day at the
White House before leaving for a three-week vacation in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   He told reporters at a news conference that his drug policy
coordinator William Bennett has given him an outline of the
developing national drug strategy.
   ``It's balanced, decisive, effective and achievable, and it will
target all aspects of the problem. It will call for commitment and
sacrifice and understanding, but it's clear to me that the American
people demand no less,'' he said.
   He said final details of the plan will be worked out over the
next several weeks before he announces the specifics on Sept. 5.
   Bennett's proposal would target drug users, as well as strengthen
enforcement. A draft of the plan obtained by The Associated Press
calls for users to be arrested and fined and to lose their driver's
licenses, their cars, their federal grants if they have any.
   Bush discussed whether to put federal financial muscle behind
such proposals in a meeting Tuesday with his Domestic Policy Council
of advisers.
   As drafted, the plan would withhold federal highway funds from
states that did not revoke drug offenders' licenses, and it would
withhold federal criminal justice funds from states that don't
perform drug tests on people in the criminal justice system. Schools
receiving federal money would have to have firm prevention programs.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said Bush was still weighing
those ideas.
   During his presidential campaign, Bush supported revocation of
drug offenders' driver's licenses.
   The draft strategy would seek a 49 percent increase in federal
treatment money for 1990, to $925 million; $1.2 billion for new
prison construction; a $200 million increase for state and local law
enforcement, and $50 million for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, most of it for security improvements at public housing
projects.
   The president, asked Tuesday if he planned to cut other programs
to fund the anti-drug war, said he could not state where the money
would come from, ``because the final decisions haven't been made.
But we will have to do some reallocation of resources, there's no
question about that.''
   Pressed on how he would come up with the funds, he added, '`We're
in a period of hard times in the sense that we don't have all the
money that we would like to spend in several areas.''
   At the same time he expressed determination to reduce the federal
budget deficit and stay within the spending limits set by
congressional budget writers.
   Some law enforcement professionals and members of Congress have
criticized the anti-drug plan being developed by Bennett under the
legislation that established his job as too reliant on enforcement
solutions.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, criticized Bush's resolve not to raise taxes to fight
drugs.
   ``To make real progress on this issue, it is going to take a
massive commitment of resources to law enforcement, drug treatment
programs, drug education, and more. If that means raising taxes to
pay for drug-fighting measures, so be it,'' Biden said Tuesday. ``We
should not let the politics of `read-my-lips' stand in the way of a
full scale effort to arrest the drug epidemic.''
   Bennett told reporters Tuesday that his plan will lay out ``terms
of accountability for all aspects of this problem, whether it's the
treatment side or the education side or the law enforcement side,
and we're holding ourselves accountable.''
   ``We're saying in 10 years, there's going to be a lot less drug
use,'' said Bennett.
   Bush on Tuesday met with two groups of community anti-drug
activists to get their opinions on what must be done.
   Among them were the parents of a Texas college student killed by
members of a drug cult.
   Jim and Helen Kilroy, among about three dozen people meeting with
Bush and Bennett, later said tougher enforcement is needed. Their
son's body was found in a mass grave outside Matamoros, Mexico.
   Drug treatment experts said after the meeting that they didn't
dwell on where to get the money for the anti-drug fight.
   Geraldine Sylvester, head of New Hampshire's Drug Rehabilitation
Services, said, ``I don't know how the funds are going to be
reallocated. But I know there is a total commitment to fight this
war on drugs on all levels and, if there has to be some shuffling of
resources, I'm certain they are astute enough to figure out exactly
how to do that.''
   The president, in his remarks, was asked if drug-producing
countries should be penalized if they fail to cooperate in stemming
the flow of drugs.
   ``I wouldn't be opposed to that, provided they were able to
cooperate with us,'' the president said.
   But he said he has ``a certain responsibility to look at the
problems that are facing some of these countries with limited armed
forces of their own, with very complicated insurgencies in their
countries and to formulate a foreign policy that takes these things
into consideration.''
   He expressed the view that Colombia's leadership wants to help,
for example, but that its effort is hindered because Colombia ``has
been ripped asunder by the drug cartels,'' with many judges and
officials assassinated.

   Syndicated gossip columnist Karen Feld filed a
lawsuit Tuesday alleging that biographer Kitty Kelley and a
photographer tried to drive her out of business.
   Feld is seeking $50 million dollars in damages from Kelley and
Time Inc. photographer Stanley Tretick for threatening to file a
lawsuit which Feld says resulted in her losing her syndicated column
at The Washington Times.
   In the lawsuit in District of Columbia Superior Court, Feld
alleged that Kelley and Tretick ``engaged in wanton, outrageous and
unjustifiable conduct, causing grave injury to Feld, including
severe emotional distress.''
   In June, Feld wrote a column saying Kelley appeared at the
funeral of the daughter of former Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger
``disguised as one of the bereaved.'' The article speculated that
Kelley, who is writing a biography of Nancy Reagan, attended only to
get access to Reagan insiders.
   Kelley told Washingtonian Magazine that she had been invited by
the Nofzigers, who confirmed the invitation, and threatened to sue
Feld. That suit was never filed.
   Feld's publicist, Samantha Dean of Samantha Dean &amp; Associates
Inc. in New York City, said that Feld stands by her column.
   Kelley did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.
   Times Managing Editor Wesley Pruden said Feld's column was not
dropped because of Kelley's complaint. ``We dropped her column for a
number of reasons. It just doesn't fit in with what we want to do,''
he said.

   President Bush, preparing for an education
summit with the nation's governors next month, signed an executive
order Tuesday establishing a new President's Education Policy
Advisory Committtee.
   He has not yet named the members, but it will be the first
presidential advisory committee on education in years.
   Bush, who has said he wants to be ``the education president,''
has summoned the governors to a summit in Charlottesville, Va.,
Sept. 27-28, to discuss the problems of the nation's schools and
search for common solutions.
   Roger Porter, the president's domestic policy adviser, will serve
as secretary for the committee, which must complete its work by Dec.
31, 1990, unless the president extends its life.
   The advisory panel that published the scathing ``A Nation At
Risk'' report in April 1983 warning of ``a rising tide of
mediocrity'' in U.S. schools was actually a creation of the
Department of Education and then-Secretary of Education T.H. Bell,
not the Reagan White House.
   But Reagan held a ceremony at the White House to unveil the
report, which helped trigger moves in virtually every state to raise
high school graduation standards.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos has said the reform movement
has brought some improvements to U.S. schools, but not enough.
   Bush proposed a $441 million package of school reforms last
April, include expanded support for magnet schools.

<TEXT>
   State officials Tuesday approved a
far-reaching blueprint to clear the polluted skies of Southern
California so the state can meet federal standards by the year 2007.
   Harriet Wieder, an Orange County Supervisor serving on the
nine-member Air Resources Board, characterized the board's plan to
clean the nation's smoggiest air as a ``leap into a `Brave New
World.'''
   ``But it's either that leap, or we wake up one morning and
discover that it's `The Day After,' and that we did it to
ourselves,'' said Brian P. Bilbray, a board member and San Diego
County Supervisor.
   The board voted 8-0 to adopt the plan, despite industry
opposition that prompted the board two months ago to request
additional information from the regional agencies that developed the
program.
   The plan was branded ``Texas justice'' by William T. Huston, a
commercial developer leading a coalition of business and labor
interests battling to revise the smog cleanup effort.
   ``They're acting as their own judge, jury and executioner,''
Huston said.
   But while two reports were presented to clarify questions raised
by business and political interests, the Air Resources Board made no
changes in adopting the plan.
   ``Those people who oppose the plan are going to have to look at
how they plan to accomplish the same goals,'' said ARB Chairwoman
Jananne Sharpless. ``So far, the alternatives offered have come up
very short of the goals, or they don't have any authority for doing
what they want to do.''
   The unprecedented plan represents a comprehensive approach to
improving air quality, using land-use planning, transportation
programs and stricter standards for industry smokestacks, automotive
emissions and petroleum-based fuels.
   It was finalized last March, following more than five years in
development, by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and
the Southern California Association of Governments.
   The first part of the three-phase program calls for enacting more
than 120 rules that would require, for example, the chemical
reformulation of aerosol sprays and stricter controls on industry
smokestacks.
   Existing smog-control rules were incorporated in the plan, but it
also serves as a blueprint for the future by outlining the process
for adopting new rules and by planning for the use of anti-pollution
technologies yet to be perfected.
   The Los Angeles basin has the worst air pollution in the nation,
and has been working under a court order to comply with standards
set by the federal Clean Air Act and enforced by the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Air quality measurements for El Monte Tuesday showed ozone levels
at about 15 hundred parts per million, an unhealthy level, said Tom
Eichhorn, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management
District.
   ``It was unhealthful, but for August in Southern California it
was pretty good,'' Eichhorn said.
   Following the board action, state and two regional agencies can
begin enacting the plan's clean air provisions, even though the EPA
has yet to give its approval, said Bill Sessa, a spokesman for the
Air Resources Board.
   California is the only state with its own standards for vehicle
emissions, and has led the nation in reducing smog by pioneering new
standards and such devices as the catalytic converter, Sessa said.
   Last June, for example, the board tightened its emission
standards, which exceed federal standards for several pollutants,
for automobiles to be produced in 1993 and afterward.
   The board also plans to require improvements in computerized
pollutant control equipment in cars, tighten state smog check
requirements and set new standards for petroleum-based fuels.
   Huston refused to say whether his group, the Community Air
Quality Task Force, plans to file a legal challenge to the plan,
although he said that's an option to be considered.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission declined
on Tuesday to confirm or deny a published report that it is
investigating USA Today financial columnist Dan Dorfman.
   According to the newsweekly U.S. News &amp; World Report, the SEC is
looking into ``whether Dorfman wittingly or unwittingly is being
used by individuals who give him information in order to manipulate
the stocks he writes about.''
   William R. McLucas, an associate director in the SEC's
enforcement division, declined to comment on the report Tuesday,
citing commission policy against confirming or denying reports of
investigations.
   Dorfman denied that he had been a party to any manipulation.
   ``I'm so careful and sensitive about what I do,'' he said Monday
night when reached at his home for comment.
   Dorfman, who also is a commentator on Cable News Network's
``Moneyline'' program, said he knew nothing about any investigation.
   ``I have not been contacted by the SEC, the New York Stock
Exchange or anybody else,'' he said. ``I think it's a lot of crap.''
   Tom Petruno, Dorfman's editor at USA Today, also said he knew of
no investigation.
   ``We have no idea where U.S. News got this information or who its
sources are,'' he said.
   Citing unidentified sources, the magazine said in its issue dated
Aug. 21 that the SEC probe deals with Centaur Partners, a
Maryland-based investment partnership that Dorfman has written about
repeatedly in the past 14 months.
   U.S. News said the SEC is investigating whether Centaur, in
establishing initial positions in several prominent companies, may
be manipulating the market in the companies' stock.
   When Dorfman reported that Centaur bought shares in these
companies, the companies' stock price rose. The question is whether
Centaur is selling shares in these companies to investors, leaving
those investors holding the bag when takeover bids don't
materialize, the magazine said.
   Maryland businessman Melvyn Estrin, president of one of the
limited partnerships that make up Centaur, denied to the magazine
that Centaur tried to manipulate stock prices or that it ever gave
Dorfman any information.

<TEXT>
   The bones of the five suspected victims
of cannibal Alferd Packer were reburied Tuesday in a simple yellow
pine coffin as a minister prayed for all victims of ``crime and
evil.''
   In a ceremony devoid of flowers or music, the scientists who dug
up the bones last month placed them in five compartments inside the
4-foot-by-4-foot corduroy-lined coffin.
   Four Lake City clergymen spoke briefly to a crowd of about 150
gathered at the hilltop grave before the coffin was lowered 8 feet
into the ground. A steel plate was placed over the coffin to
discourage vandals.
   Packer was the only survivor of a snowbound party of Utah
gold-seekers that was trapped in the San Juan Mountains in southwest
Colorado during the winter of 1874.
   Packer claimed one member of the party killed the other four and
Packer was forced to kill him in self-defense. He said he ate their
remains to survive.
   He eventually was convicted of manslaughter and served time in
prison, but maintained his innocence until his death.
   Dr. James Starrs, a George Washington University law professor
who wanted to separate fact from legend about Packer, led a research
team that dug up the bones last month.
   The bones and other artifacts found in the common grave were
transported to the Arizona State Museum in Tucson for analysis. But
time and money shortages forced the reburial of the bones earlier
than the scientists had hoped.
   Last week, Starrs and Walter Birkby, curator of physical
anthropology at the Arizona State Museum, said they found at least
four of the victims were bludgeoned to death in butcher fashion and
then were carefully defleshed. They also said there was no visible
evidence that any had suffered gunshot wounds.
   Birkby said Tuesday that the only answer scientists found in
their examination of the remains was that the victims were murdered
and cannibalized.
   ``We found nothing to corroborate or refute anything Packer
said,'' Birkby said Tuesday. ``We'll never know who did it based on
any solid physical evidence. We're never going to know.''
   When the bones were dug up in July, the expedition took on the
air of a light-hearted historical circus. Reporters descended on the
community and T-shirts with slogans such as ``have a friend for
dinner'' and ``taste the high country'' sold briskly.
   On Tuesday, the Rev. Jeff Light of the Presbyterian Community
Church began the reburial ceremony with a prayer for victims of
``crime and evil.''
   Three other ministers, representing the other religious
communities of Lake City, population about 400, addressed the
gathering of local residents and tourists. Then the scientists
placed the bones in the coffin compartments and served as
pall-bearers.
   Sandra Jarman, who owns the property on which the remains were
buried, placed five grapevines and eucalyptus leaves on the coffin
before it was lowered into the common grave.
   Dressed in a black jogging suit and black tennis shoes, Jarman
said she's pleased the bones have been returned to the place where
they were dumped in burlap sacks 115 years ago.
   ``They've become my little friends,'' she said.
   A headstone erected on the site in 1928 or 1929 was to be
restored to its place and the site opened to tourists Wednesday.

<HEAD>Greek Cypriots March to Protest Turkish Occupation of Famagusta</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 3,000 Greek Cypriots holding
lighted candles marched Tuesday to the U.N.-policed Green Line to
protest the Turkish occupation of Famagusta, once a flourishing
tourist resort.
   The Green Line divides the island into Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot zones.
   The marchers, led by Famagusta's former Mayor Nikos Voyatzis,
walked through Dherenia, a suburb of the now-deserted port city, to
a checkpoint. There they handed a U.N. officer a petition calling
for Greek Cypriot refugees to be allowed to return home.
   ``Greeks and Turks must live together,'' the demonstrators
shouted.
   The demonstration marked the day in 1974 that Turkish troops
seized Famagusta after invading Cyprus. The Turks invaded after a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking to unite the island with
with Greece.
   Before the march, a message from President George Vassiliou, the
Greek Cypriot leader, was read, saying ``We reiterate our
determination to return to our homes in the Turkish-occupied north,
but we are trying to achieve this through peaceful means.''
   Vassiliou referred to U.N.-sponsored talks being conducted with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash aimed at reunifying the island
as a two-zone federated state.
   The Green Line that splits the island is guarded by a
2,300-member U.N. peacekeeping force that has served in Cyprus since
violence flared in 1963.

   Gay Men's Health Crisis on Tuesday urged New
Yorkers who may have AIDS to seriously consider being tested for the
disease, a change of emphasis that the group said was based on
medical and political developments.
   While the organization has been skeptical about testing in the
past, its director, Richard Dunne, said it was reassured by a state
confidentiality law and encouraged by evidence some drugs can extend
the lives of AIDS patients.
   ``We've always said think about it,'' said Dunne. ``The
difference is that if you thought about it in 1985 you probably
wouldn't want to get tested. If you think about it in 1989, you
probably will want to get tested.''
   The organization was not recommending the test be taken, Dunne
said, because the decision was a personal one.
   GMHC placed ads headlined, ``Think about it,'' in the city's four
major daily newspapers Tuesday. They noted that the drug AZT can
slow development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and
treatments such as aerosolized pentamidine can prevent some
AIDS-related illnesses.
   GMHC provides counseling for people with AIDS and lobbies in
their behalf.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer who said he was running for ``an American
seat'' decisively captured the Democratic nomination Tuesday over a
Cuban-born woman in an ethnically tense battle to succeed the late
Rep. Claude Pepper.
   Gerald Richman, a 47-year-old former Florida Bar Association
president making his first run for office, defeated Rosario Kennedy,
44, who resigned after four years as a Miami city commissioner to
run in the special election.
   With all of 146 precincts reporting unofficial returns, Richman
had 14,411 votes, or 61 percent, to 9,226 votes, or 39 percent, for
Ms. Kennedy.
   Richman will face Republican state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 37,
on Aug. 29. President Bush will campaign with the Cuban-born
educator here Wednesday as the Republican Party eyes what it
considers a golden opportunity to add to its 10-8 majority in
Florida's congressional delegation.
   Pepper held the seat for the Democrats from its inception until
his death 27 years later, May 30 at age 88.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Richman stunned Ms. Kennedy, the Democratic front-runner, with a
late-charging, 146-vote victory in the Aug. 1 primary, in which five
other Democrats were eliminated.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, whose resignation after seven years as state
legislator is effective Aug. 29, won the four-way race for GOP
nomination with 83 percent of the vote. Her campaign manager is Jeb
Bush, the president's son.
   Little difference on issues emerged between Ms. Kennedy and
Richman in their runoff, dominated by discussion of ethnic
divisiveness, qualifications and ability to defeat Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.
   In late charges, Ms. Kennedy criticized Richman, who raised money
for Democratic candidates in 1988, for contributing $2,000 to the
Bush campaign. Richman said he attended a Bush dinner at a friend's
request and his campaign countered that Ms. Kennedy campaigned with
then-candidate Dan Quayle. Her campaign said she appeared with
Quayle in her role as a city commissioner.
   Ms. Kennedy carried predominantly Hispanic precincts Aug. 1, and
Richman dominated Miami Beach's Jewish and retiree vote.
   Jo Ann Pepper, the late congressman's niece, and black candidates
Marvin Dunn and Sonny Wright dominated the diverse district's black
neighborhoods and all three have endorsed Ms. Kennedy. However,
Richman devoted much attention to the black vote in the runoff race.
   There are 32,183 registered black voters, 16,028 registered
Hispanics and 51,987 non-Hispanic whites among the 100,198
registered Democrats in the 18th District.
   Richman has said repeatedly: ``This is an American seat.''
Richman says that theme means he is ``for all the people'' and that
he rejects Republican leader Lee Atwater's 2-month-old statement
it's time to elect the first Cuban-American to Congress. The
most-qualified candidate should be elected, he says.
   Ms. Kennedy says her remark in jest that she was ``that
Cuban-American'' was in the context that the Republican front-runner
was Cuban-born.
   Ms. Kennedy, who was 14 when she left Cuba, implied in a Saturday
debate that Richman's campaign tried to exploit her Spanish accent
and asked Richman: ``When are you going to stop this type of
divisive campaign?''
   The Dade County Fair Campaign Practices Committee was critical of
Richman's campaign, and The Miami Herald called it ``naked,
deliberate, bigotry'' and has endorsed Ms. Kennedy.
   Democrats are concerned about increasing Hispanic numbers, 40
percent to 50 percent of the registered voters, in the district.
Most are Republicans.
   Richman supporters say he can best energize the vote in black
neighborhoods and on Miami Beach to capitalize on the Democrats'
continued registration advantage.
   There are 71,620 registered Republicans, 46,738 of them
Hispanic-born.

<HEAD>Valdez Moving Into Drydock For Nine Months Of Repairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK EVJE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipyard workers on Tuesday began moving the
Exxon Valdez from a pier to a dock where the tanker that caused the
nation's worst oil spill will be repaired over the next nine months.
   Tugboats helped guide the 987-foot ship into the repair dock,
which is only 3 feet wider than the 166-foot-wide Valdez, National
Steel and Shipbuilding Co. officials said.
   Workers plannd to tow the Valdez from its current berth at a
NASSCO pier into San Diego Bay, then turn and back it stern-first
into the dock.
   The vessel was launched three years ago from the same dock, which
resembles a huge swimming pool separated from the bay by a moveable
gate.
   The crippled ship was returned to NASSCO from Alaska, where it
ran aground March 24 in Prince William Sound, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of crude into the sound's wildlife-rich waters.
   Repairs to the ship and its shredded hull were expected to cost
about $25 million.
   Dockmaster Frank Russell, a veteran of more than 40 dockings,
said he would use up to eight tugs to coordinate the ship's movement
while monitoring the tanker's position through a team of divers and
surveying instruments.
   Shipyard workers were not expected to start repairs this week
because it will take about six days to remove all the water from the
dock.
   ``I suspect there will be a two-week period in which the only
people in there will be lawyers and engineers,'' said NASSCO senior
vice president Al Lutter.
   Once inside, the gate will be closed and NAASCO crews will start
draining water from the repair dock. After lowering the water level
about six feet, which takes about four hours, the Valdez will come
to rest on blocks and supports that will hold the ship while it's
being repaired.
   Five clusters of 24 adjustable jacks, each having a 250-ton
capacity, have been installed to maintain an even keel when the ship
is lowered. A level landing was crucial because the tanker otherwise
might slide off the blocks and damage itself and the repair dock,
Russell said.
   Exxon Shipping Co. officials have said they plan to return the
tanker to service, though possibly under a different name, after
repairs are completed.
   The Valdez arrived off the San Diego coast July 10 after being
towed more than 2,000 miles from Prince William Sound. But its entry
into the bay was delayed three weeks after oil slicks were sighted
near the vessel. The ship pulled into the NASSCO yard on July 31.

   Parked amid the tents and trailers littering
the alfalfa field, the site of rock 'n' roll's most memorable
concert 20 years ago Tuesday, was a jeep with the license plate ``TV
Junkie.''
   It was in the right place. Woodstock's 20th anniversary party was
a premier media event, with dozens of reporters elbowing each other
to find out if the peace and love generation had lost its way in the
1980s.
   A forest of satellite dishes surrounded a plaque that
commemorated the epochal three-day concert that attracted some
400,000 spectators. Woodstock veterans and wistful ``wannabes''
barely had the chance to formulate their reminiscences before being
asked to share them with the world.
   ``You want my favorite quote?'' Debbie Armstrong, of Montgomery,
N.Y., called out as a reporter wandered by a tent thick with tattoos
and tie-dyed shirts. ``We feel like we're at the Orange County Fair
_ only we're the attraction.''
   Much to some people's disappointment, there was no organized
celebration of Woodstock's 20th anniversary at the late Max Yasgur's
one-time farm. Rather, it was a free-form party, as tourists mingled
with campers staking their turf under the watchful eyes of dozens of
cameras.
   Armstrong and her friends said they'd been interviewed about a
dozen times. Their favorite came Monday night, when they crowded
around a campfire and shouted ``Goodnight from Woodstock'' on cue to
a cameraman from Scranton, Pa.
   ``This has turned into such a media event,'' she said. ``Back
then, they (reporters) weren't even into the heart of it. It took 20
years for the spirit to sink in.''
   But the attention has its downside, she said.
   ``A lot of people are drawn toward the cameras,'' she said. ``A
lot of people are behaving because the press is looking.''
   That didn't stop one man with a cast on his foot from holding up
a marijuana cigarette. When questioned by a reporter, his companion
said she was from Venus.
   Twenty-year-old Denise Frangipane of Bethel said she'd been
camping at the site for the last four days, ``because we weren't
there last time. I'm getting tired of saying that.'' She said she
made the same statement the day before to a German television crew,
or was it a French team?
   A makeshift stage crammed with speakers stood at the bottom of
the natural amphitheater where Richie Havens launched the original
Woodstock with a three-hour show.
   ``Anybody who has anything just gets up and plays,'' Frangipane
said. Despite hopeful rumors spreading through the crowd that the
Grateful Dead would make a return engagement, the stage was empty
Tuesday afternoon.
   Makeshift hot dog, souvenir and T-shirt stands lined the country
road leading to the field, where several hundred people were
gathered Tuesday.
   A representative of the field's current owners, June Gelish and
Louis Nicky of New York City, collected $5 from each carload for
``field restoration.''
   Ron Anderson, 42, put a guitar in the back of his car and drove
up from Coventry, Conn., for the day. He'd already been interviewed
by reporters from enough channel numbers to make up a lottery card.
   He wasn't at the original concert, but said he was glad to
experience it this way.
   ``I didn't really know what to expect. I found it to be quite
interesting. We've met some pretty nice people,'' he said.

   The family of Rep. Mickey Leland said Tuesday the
best way to honor the late congressman would be to continue his
life's work to fight world hunger.
   In a statement released Tuesday, family members expressed thanks
to President Bush, the Ethiopian government and others who worked to
find Leland and the 15 others who perished in a remote mountainside
plane crash a week ago.
   The family also announced that a burial Mass would be held at 10
a.m. Saturday at St. Anne's Catholic Church in Houston. A community
memorial service was scheduled Friday at Texas Southern University.
   ``We take great comfort in knowing that Mickey died living his
passion: To end world hunger,'' Houston City Councilor Rodney Ellis
said, reading from the family's statement. ``The legacy of Mickey
Leland asks that each of us to continue to share in his vision, not
only of ending world hunger and homelessness, but also of a world
where all nations and their people are at peace.''
   Leland and his party of 15, including eight other Americans, died
when their twin-engine plane crashed into a rugged mountainside in
Ethiopia while en route to a refugee camp near the Sudan border. The
plane disappeared Aug. 7 and was discovered early Sunday morning.
   Leland, 44, was head of the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   The Houston Democrat's family said they wanted to complete
Leland's work ``by making sure that every child in every nation has
an opportunity to grow to a healthy adulthood.'' They asked that
donations in Leland's honor be made to InterAction, an international
hunger relief organization, or by contacting a food bank.

   A former Boeing Co. executive was indicted
by a federal grand jury Tuesday on charges he stole and reproduced
classified Pentagon and National Security Council documents.
   Richard Lee Fowler, 64, allegedly stole secret Pentagon planning
documents while he was selling Boeing products to the military from
1979 to 1985.
   The classified documents described the Pentagon's Planning,
Programming and Budgeting System, used to plan future weapons
purchases.
   ``Possession of these documents would provide a competitive edge
to anyone in the business of supplying the (Defense Department) with
tactical and strategic weaponry,'' Pentagon Inspector General June
Gibbs Brown said in a statement.
   Fowler, who had been a senior marketing analyst with Boeing, was
charged as part of a continuing investigation into allegations some
defense contractors got the planning documents illegally, according
to a statement by U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson.
   The charges are not related to the ``Operation Ill Wind''
investigation of armed forces contract fraud and bribery that has
resulted in dozens of indictments since June 1988 and nine
convictions.
   Fowler, of Springfield, Va., was charged with a total of 39
felony counts, including a charge he removed the ``secret''
classification stamp from some documents and reproduced them for
other Boeing executives. He could be sentenced to 310 years in
prison and fined $265,000 if convicted.
   Reached at home Tuesday night, Fowler declined to comment on his
indictment.

   The second flight of the
B-2 stealth bomber was scrubbed Tuesday because a preflight
checklist took too long to complete to get a full day's flight test
completed, the Air Force said.
   Col. Don Weisert, the B-2's deputy program director at Ohio's
Wright-Patterson AFB, also blamed the weather and said in a
telephone interview, ``There was nothing wrong with the airplane.''
   ``We expected winds to come up and we wanted to make sure we
could get in a full day of activity,'' he said.
   A statement released at Edwards said: ``The second flight of the
B-2 has been delayed because of the crew rest requirement. They have
been on duty on preflight status for the maximum time for safety.''
   Air Force officials did not specify how long was the allowable
duty day for the B-2 crew. Flight crews, however, must be allowed
sufficient periods of rest depending on the requirements of the
mission.
   The three- to four-hour second flight, which may include
retracting its landing gear, faster speeds and higher altitudes, was
initially planned for Saturday but was postponed.
   After a five-hour delay on Tuesday, the ominous-looking flying
wing emerged from its hangar at about 12:30 p.m. and rested for
about 90 minutes before the mission was scrubbed.
   Captain Tess Taft, an Air Force spokeswoman reached at
Wright-Patterson said, ``It looks good for tomorrow.''
   On its July 17 maiden flight, Northrop Corp. test pilot Bruce J.
Hinds and Air Force Col. Richard Couch flew the B-2 for nearly two
hours and reached an altitude of 10,000 feet without retracting the
landing gear.
   The B-2, a tailless, 172-foot-long wing with bulges in the
middle, was described by Couch as a ``very nimble aircraft'' and ``a
lot of fun'' to fly.
   The $530 million, four-engine bomber, engineered to elude radar
detection, is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, along with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aged B-52 bomber fleet
that forms part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent against the Soviet
Union.
   The so-called stealth technology combines advanced composite
materials and a special shape to create a plane believed to be
undetectable by enemy radar. Though the bomber is still being
developed, stealth fighters have operated for several years.
   The government has already invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has
balked at the thought of paying more than $500 million apiece for
132 bombers.
   On July 14, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved
President Bush's $305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal
1990, but stipulated no money could be spent on the B-2 until it
flew.
   Despite the bomber's first successful flight, however,
congressional opposition remains.
   Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, Northrop and the Pentagon last
month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes. A list
of 156 B-2 contractors in 26 states and the District of Columbia was
declassified.
   The Pentagon wants $4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming
fiscal year, and it may need $8 billion in each of the three years
of peak production, 1992 to 1994.

   A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that
Jewish inmates at the State Prison of Southern Michigan should be
allowed to travel between complexes at the prison site so they can
attend weekly Sabbath services.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously rejected claims by Michigan prison officials that
permitting the inter-complex travel by six Jewish inmates would pose
security problems. The inmates accused prison officials of violating
their civil rights.
   The appeals court's decision reverses a ruling by U.S. District
Judge Horace Gilmore, who upheld the prison officials' position and
barred travel of the prisoners for the weekly services.
   The appeals court upheld another portion of Gilmore's order which
requires the prison officials to permit an annual Passover Seder
observance at the prison.
   The inmates filed suit in April 1986.
   The Michigan facility once was operated as a single 4,500-bed
prison, but has since been split into three separate complexes,
according to testimony.

   A United Airlines jet made an emergency landing in St. Louis
Tuesday when a warning light indicated a problem with the landing
gear, and an American Trans Air jet landed in Chicago after the
pilot shut down an engine, officials said.
   No one was injured in either incident, said spokesman Mort
Edelstein of the Federal Aviation Administration's Chicago office.
   United Flight 673, en route from Chicago to St. Louis with 83
people aboard, notified the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport
control tower about 11:30 a.m. that the left main landing gear might
not be fully extended, said Tony Boos, a spokesman for the St. Louis
Airport Authority.
   ``We do not know what was wrong, but we do know the landing gear
held firm on contact,'' said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.
   The Boeing 737 circled the airport for nearly an hour to burn off
as much fuel as possible, Boos said.
   Mechanics were working to determine the problem.
   Several hours later, the American Trans Air jet landed at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after rescue crews were put
on emergency standby.
   The American Trans Air charter flight was carrying only a crew of
three.
   Authorities have not determined why the pilot shut down the rear
engine on the three-engine Boeing 727 jet, the FAA said.
   On Sunday, the rear engine of a Continental Airlines Boeing 727
bound for Portland, Ore., disintegrated as the plane was taking off
from Denver, forcing the pilot to abort the takeoff.

   Soldiers rushed a prison Tuesday
and shot to death 16 convicts who had been holding members of
religious group hostage for three days. Five hostages, including a
9-year-old boy, were killed.
   Among the slain hostages was an Australian missionary who one of
the freed captives said had been raped at knifepoint the night
before she was killed.
   Officials reported it was decided to storm the prison after some
of the 15 hostages escaped and told them the would-be escapees had
killed other captives.
   ``We were not ... dealing with reasonable people,'' said Justice
Undersecretary Silvestre Bello, who was involved in negotiations
with the convicts. ``We had to authorize a military operation,
especially since there was an urgent need to save the five living
hostages.''
   The attack began about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firing
automatic weapons and secured the downtown jail in Davao City, 610
miles southeast of Manila, after about 40 minutes, witnesses and
officials said.
   A few hours earlier, the convicts had tried to escape by using
hostages as shields. During the confusion, a captive was killed and
five others fled. They told police four other hostages had been
slain.
   Jacqueline Hamill, a missionary from Sydney, was among those
slain by the convicts. Her body was found dumped outside the
detention center with a bullet wound in the chest.
   The Rev. Fred Castillo, one of the freed hostages, said Miss
Hamill and some of the nine other women hostages were raped. Other
freed hostages said they heard the women screaming on Monday night.
   ``Jackie told me about the incident,'' Castillo said Tuesday.
   The standoff began Sunday at the Metropolitan District Command
Center in Davao City. Bello said inmates overpowered a guard during
a Bible session at the prison and then looted additional weaons from
an armory.
   All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a
Protestant group.
   The leader of the convicts was identified as Mohammed Naser
Samparani, a former air force soldier convicted of murder. He had
threatened to kill Miss Hamill unless authorities provided a getaway
vehicle by 4 p.m. Tuesday. Bella said.
   Samparani then changed his mind and said the inmates wanted to
flee the prison immediately.
   The convicts emerged a few minutes later with their captives and
began firing, the military said.
   Samparani and a 16-year-old female hostage were killed then. The
remaining inmates withdrew into the compound with the other hostages.
   Five hostages escaped in the next hour and told authorities at
least four other captives were dead.
   They included Miss Hamill, 36, who had been in Davao City one
month, and a 9-year-old boy.
   Officials quoted them as saying the captors also raped some of
the female hostages.
   Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccay, the regional military commander, said
none of the hostages was killed in the military assault.
   Police said most of the inmates had escaped in April from the
Davao Penal Colony and seized several hostages to protest conditions
at the prison.
   They surrendered after being promised they would be transferred
to the Muntinlupa prison, in a Manila suburb, but they were not
moved.

   A crack addict was arrested Tuesday in the
stabbing death of woman whose screams were ignored by neighbors
until an hour after the attack allegedly began, police said.
   Franklin Rivera, a 21-year-old handyman, was taken into custody
at a subway station in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, said
Deputy Chief Francis X. Smith.
   Rivera allegedly broke through a rear window of Ruth Velez's
apartment in a three-story house to commit a burglary about 10 p.m.
Saturday, Smith said.
   Velez, 39, pulled out a kitchen knife to defend herself, and the
intruder grabbed it from her, stabbed her in the stomach and beat
her around the head, Smith said.
   Neighbors heard screams but did not call the police until shortly
after 11 p.m., Smith said.
   Rivera had worked for 10 weeks for a contractor who stored
equipment in the garage of the house where Velez lived, Smith said.
   Smith said neighbors should not be blamed for not calling police
right away.
   ``They misevaluated the degree of urgency of the screams,'' he
said.
   Rivera told detectives he had been taking crack for the last four
or five days, Smith said.

   Dave Dravecky, who made a comeback from cancer in
his pitching arm, hurt the arm and tumbled to the ground while
pitching Tuesday night and was taken off the mound on a stretcher.
   X-rays taken at Queen Elizabeth Hospital were negative, and a
Giants spokesman said the injury did not appear to be serious.
Dravecky was conscious as he left the field carried by his San
Francisco Giants teammates.
   ``It was a sharp, painful pop,'' Dravecky, 33, told trainers.
``It was the strangest experience I've ever felt.''
   Dravecky, who had a cancerous tumor removed from his left arm
less than a year ago, was making his second start for the Giants in
his comeback.
   Dravecky was pitching to Montreal's Tim Raines when the injury
occurred. The pitch went wild and he suddenly fell.
   Trainers and teammates rushed to the mound and surrounded
Dravecky. Dravecky was sitting up on a stretcher as he was removed
and trainers were holding Dravecky's left arm.
   Dravecky took a three-hitter and 3-0 lead into the sixth. Damaso
Garcia led off with a home run and Andres Galarraga was hit by a
pitch before Dravecky hurt himself.
   Dravecky won his first start for the Giants last Thursday,
pitching into the eighth inning in beating Cincinnati.

   Masked rioters threw
homemade gasoline bombs and rocks at police in Londonderry early
today following a peaceful march by IRA supporters 20 years to the
day since British troops entered the city.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the three hours of pre-dawn
violence occurred in the city's Roman Catholic Bogside area where
crowds barricaded streets two decades earlier in battles with police.
   Police fired dozens of plastic bullets to break up the rioters,
who wore masks to hide their identities. Police said two men were
hit and injured by the bullets but that their condition was not
thought to be serious.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said that at
one stage gunshots were heard, apparently fired at police, and that
officers later were reported to have fired in the air to scare off
the rioters.

   Many minorities infected with the AIDS virus
are not seeking new life-prolonging treatments because of a lack of
information and distrust of the medical establishment, doctors and
social workers say.
   Poor blacks and Hispanics are under-represented in AIDS clinical
trials where experimental therapies are tested, and they often don't
seek treatment until they are sick enough to qualify for free
medical care, said AIDS caseworkers attending a government
conference on AIDS and minorities.
   ``They're not as well-educated about prevention and they don't
have a cousin who is a doctor who can tell them about the latest
drug that's being tested in a clinical trial in their area,'' said
Dr. Gina Brown, an assistant attending physician in obstetrics and
gynecology at Harlem Hospital.
   Also, the poor are often suspicious of attempts to get them into
medical research, she said. Many hear only that the treatments, like
AZT, make patients sick and don't understand that the drug can
cripple the AIDS virus, said Brown, also a clinical instructor at
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York.

   Teen-agers and adults alike view drug abuse as
the most important problem facing the country _ eclipsing fear of
war, the economy, AIDS, crime, abortion and alcohol abuse as top
concerns, says a new Gallup poll.
   The results, said William Bennett, the national drug policy
coordinator, ``give a very clear sense of direction'' to the Bush
administration, which is to unveil its drug strategy on Sept. 5.
   The Gallup report was released as President Bush prepared to
discuss drug strategy today in three meetings, two with outside
groups and one with his domestic policy council.
   One adult in four and one teen-ager in three has come to believe
that drug abuse is the country's greatest problem, said the poll
released at the White House on Monday. Six in 10 teen-agers believe
it is the greatest problem facing their generation.

   A Panamanian bank was ordered to pay the United

pleading guilty to federal charges that it laundered $411 million
for a South American cocaine cartel.
   Banco de Occidente of Panama, where two managers allegedly
conspired with the Medillin cartel, entered its guilty plea Monday
before U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley.
   The $5 million fine was the largest ever imposed by a federal
court against a bank for drug-money laundering, said U.S. Attorney
Robert L. Barr Jr. The conviction was the first of its kind
involving a foreign bank with no U.S. operations.
   The guilty plea resulted from a plea bargain between prosecutors
and the bank, which had faced a maximum penalty of fines totaling
$10.5 million and forfeiture of an amount equal to assets identified
as cocaine proceeds.

   A defense attorney sees the McMartin preschool
molestation trial as ``a cottage industry event'' and legal experts
say its protracted length is symptomatic of a bloated, unworkable
justice system.
   With the trial in its third year and the charges against Raymond
Buckey and his mother 6 years old, the McMartin case has set records
in criminal law. And it's not over yet.
   In April, the trial became the longest in U.S. history,
surpassing the two-year record of the Hillside Strangler case. Its
cost was estimated recently at $15 million and climbing.
   ``This trial has become a cottage industry event,'' said Buckey's
attorney Danny Davis. ``It made experts out of people who testified.
It became an annuity for attorneys. It has regularly been a ratings
focus for television. ... Lots of carpet baggers glom on and make
hay.''

   It may be art, but Illinois tourism officials
couldn't believe their eyes when an ad featuring an Alberto Vargas
watercolor of a nude woman fondling her breasts beckoned Europeans
to visit Chicago.
   Portrayed on the other side of the Atlantic as home to seamy
politics, bluesy music and gangsters, the city has long been viewed
as a wide-open town. But this time, city and state officials
concurred, someone went too far.
   ``We think there are a lot greater things that portray Chicago
better than a nude lady,'' said Avis LaVelle, spokeswoman for Mayor
Richard M. Daley.
   ``I'm sorry it happened,'' Gov. James R. Thompson said, ``but it
wasn't our fault.''
   Developed for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community
Affairs by the Milan, Italy-based STZ agency, the ad featuring
``Legacy Nude No. 1'' was part of a 13-week campaign running in the
European editions of Newsweek and Time.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If there can be an unsung hero in opera,
especially in a monumental extravaganza such as ``Die Meistersinger
von Nuremberg,'' it would have to be the chorus master.
   Despite the central role of the 97 singers, the largest chorus in
any Seattle Opera production to date, the man charged with welding
them into a crisp ensemble with flawless diction and perfect pitch
gets no major billing and takes no bows.
   What George Fiore does take is unabashed pride in his work.
   ``I'm always in charge, because I have to be,'' he said. ``I get
very good results with the chorus.''
   In an interview at a rehearsal earlier this month, Fiore waxed
enthusiastic during a parade scene that brings more than 100 people
on stage in the third act.
   ``You see that? Active, energetic. They really are the populace,
not just 100 sticks, people singing notes,'' he said.
   The 63-year-old Fiore became chorus master five years ago after
occasional work as associate chorus master, coach for principal
singers and other jobs with the opera dating to 1968.
   ``I brought him in,'' said Speight Jenkins, general director of
the Seattle Opera. ``I don't think there's a better chorus master in
the country.''
   Jenkins, who spent two years as host of the television series
``Live From the Met'' and eight as music critic for the New York
Post, said Fiore's crowning achievement was a fight scene with 135
people on stage in the second act.
   ``For three minutes they are in a wild melee, singing and
fighting on stage. Then the night watchman's horn is heard, and
everyone vanishes,'' Jenkins said.
   The libretto calls for 16 separate vocal lines _ for example,
four soprano sections _ each exchanging epithets. In previous modern
stagings, Jenkins said, ``they simply have each line of people sing
all the words.''
   Director Francois Rochaix, however, decided that to be true to
Wagner's libretto, half the singers in each line should sing one
epithet and the other half the response.
   ``People are going to hear a difference, a clarity of lines, I
hope,'' Jenkins said. ``George has done such extraordinary work that
the people are able to do this. He taught it to them (to sing)
faster than he ever thought Hermann (Michael) could conduct it.''
   With the slightest breakdown in timing, anything less than
perfect pitch and diction, the music would sink into cacophany.
   ``I think we've rehearsed that fight scene 30 or 40 times. It
hasn't fallen apart yet,'' Jenkins said.
   ``Die Meistersinger,'' one of the longest operas at six housrs,
poses other challenges as well. Total costs are likely to exceed
$1.6 million for seven performances Aug. 3-19.
   ``A (new) production on the scale of ours has not been done since
the Met's (The Metropolitan Opera) in 1962,'' Jenkins said.
``Everybody likes to do `Die Meistersinger.' It's just that they
can't afford to produce it.''
   A quarter or more of the cost goes for costumes, sets and other
one-time expenses.
   Under a contract with the American Guild of Musical Artists,
full-time choristers get $8 an hour for rehearsal time, plus a
performance fee, for a total of about $1,200 for ``Die
Meistersinger,'' while auxiliaries earn as little as about $100
total, said Monte Jacobson, a soprano in the chorus since the
company was founded 25 years ago.
   ``They all have jobs like anybody else,'' Fiore said. `Some of
them are housewives, of course, but that's a full-time job, too.''
   Regulars, including those from past seasons, must survive an
audition every two years. About 190 singers were heard in special
auditions to choose the 61 auxiliary choristers in ``Die
Meistersinger.''
   The chorus, which began rehearsals May 18, sings the opening and
closing lyrics, and ``Die Meistersinger'' is one of handful of
operas in which ``the people'' comprise a central role.
   ``Wagner composed this opera as a strong statement of the German
people,'' Jenkins said. ``In each of the acts, the people have a
very strong role to play.''
   Set in 16th-century Nuremberg, the opera tells the story of Hans
Sachs, a cobbler and master singer who winds up serving as principal
judge in a song contest among the town's apprentice master singers.
To the victor goes the hand and fortune of Eva, the beautiful
daughter of the town's wealthy goldsmith and the object of Sach's
own unrequited love.
   The cast includes Roger Roloff as Sachs, soprano Helen Donath as
Eva, and Julian Patrick, Benn Heppner and Bergitta Svenden in other
lead roles.
   ``Die Meistersinger'' is the seventh new Wagner production for
Jenkins. Since he took over in 1983, the Seattle Opera has risen to
No. 6 in attendance nationwide, and Wagner News has declared it
``without a doubt the leading Wagner company in America.''
   The company is best known for annual stagings of Wagner's
four-part ``Der Ring des Niebelungen'' from 1975 to 1987, the first
nine years in English as well as German.
   Jenkins, hired largely to overhaul the Ring, presided over new
productions of ``Die Walkure'' in 1985 and of ``Das Rheingold,''
``Siegfried'' and ``Die Gotterdammerung'' in 1986.
   Despite the company's overall financial health, annual
productions ended in 1988 because of persistent operating deficits
for the $3.5 million summer extravaganza and what Jenkins saw as a
lack of sufficient local corporate and individual donations. He has
said he hopes to revive the Ring for performances every two or three
years, starting in 1991.
   The Ring's legacy is evidence this year with the return of
Michael as conducter, Rochaix as director, Joan Sullivan as lighting
director and soloists Patrick and Roloff, who sang Wotan in 1984,
1986 and 1987.

   As one editor at People magazine recalls, there
was no ``burst of pride'' among the staff when some of their stories
began appearing two years ago on a televised edition of the weekly.
   But Hal Wingo, the magazine's assistant managing editor, says
``People Magazine on TV'' is winning over the more than 150 writers,
editors, artists and production staff as it prepares to air its
fifth edition on Wednesday.
   ``Some of them were disappointed in it in the beginning,'' he
said of the staff's reaction. ``I believe this next show is the best
reflection yet of what the magazine is all about. It feels like the
magazine.''
   The staff was concerned, he said, because a quality TV show would
stimulate sales of the magazine, which sells a majority of its
copies on newstands. Generally, no subject airs unless it already
was in print.
   This time, the one-hour special on CBS includes an interview with
Christie Brinkley and Billy Joel in which the singer strikes back at
those who claim the couple will split, and a segment about Robert
Redford's fight to save an endangered Hispanic community.
   It also looks at the case of a woman who has been in jail for two
years because she refused to allow her daughter to visit the
ex-husband she claims raped the girl.
   It takes the viewer to Zambia to hear about the successful
efforts of a U.S. couple who went there five years ago to teach
local residents the importance of making their government protect
wild animals being killed off by poachers.
   And it includes an interview with professional tennis player
Michael Chang and a first-person narrative from the mother of two
5-year-old conjoined sisters.
   Wingo said the mix of celebrity interviews, features and more
serious subjects is closer to what the magazine strives to publish
each week.
   The magazine went through the same sort of search for the best
combination of stories when it started, he said.
   ``Nobody had ever done this before. We kind of made up the rules
as we went along,'' Wingo said.
   Duplicating the broad mix of 20 to 25 stories in the magazine was
difficult on the televised special, which could only include six to
eight segments, and it irritated the magazine's staff, he said.
   But Ward Sylvester, supervising producer of the TV special, said
he'd ``like to think we've always reflected the magazine.''
   ``Many of our stories were covers,'' he said. ``We look at the
magazine and try to think of stories that will translate well.''
   Sylvester said the show has improved since the arrival of KCBS-TV
Los Angeles anchor Bree Walker, who was host for the first time when
it aired last in April.
   ``I lean toward the hard news features, that's my bent,'' she
said. ``One of the things that they wanted to do was try to make
`People Magazine on TV' a more topical and newsier show.
Issue-oriented features will be a bright spot of this next show.''
   Walker added: ``We have to be a little forgiving the first time
around on any new show.''

<HEAD>Inflation Stopped In Its Tracks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inflationary thrust that began in 1987 and
seemed to be gathering momentum was blunted in July, according to a
small-business survey with a record of accuracy.
   ``What appeared to be an inflation-gathering-steam has suddenly
dissipated,'' said Prof. William Dunkelberg, who conducts the survey
for the National Federation of Independent Business.
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of business and
management, said the change was clearly reflected in written
responses from 1,851 small- and medium-size businesses, and was
abrupt and substantial.
   Prior to the latest survey, responses showed actual and planned
price increases had steadily increased for nearly two years, raising
until recently the fear of a broad-based resurgence of inflation.
   That fear was shared by many economists, the Federal Reserve
Board and even by some White House advisers, but based on the latest
responses, Dunkelberg said that ``at least for the moment, the
momentum in prices has been blunted.''
   The survey, which examines existing conditions and attitudes
about the future of prices, hiring, inventories, borrowing and
various other factors, seeks to obtain an indication of economic
conditions six months hence.
   Many of these indicators are then synthesized and expressed in a
``Small Business Optimism Index,'' which last month rose slightly to
99.8 from 99.5 in the second quarter of this year.
   For comparison purposes, the third quarter of 1975 is assumed to
be 100, meaning the latest index approximates the expectations of
small and mediuum-size businesses at that time.
   The index, begun in 1974, reached its highest reading of 108.7 in
the first quarter of 1984, and remained above 100 with just two
exceptions until the second quarter of this year. Its low was 81.1
in the second quarter of 1980.
   The latest measurement, said Dunkelberg, suggests a modest
improvement over the second quarter in the outlook for business
conditions and business expansion, although the future of the
economy as a whole stays a bit negative.
   Analyzing the report, Dunkelberg said more companies expect a
deterioration of economic conditions than improvement over the next
six months. Unemployment might drop slightly, then rise modestly.
Interest rates will fall a bit.
   In the professor's estimate, the current weakness in interest
rates ``is more a result of weakening credit demands than of Federal
Reserve easing.''
   Earlier studies have shown a reluctance of many firms to take on
debt in recent years. In the late 1970s more than 50 percent of
respondents said they were regular borrowers, but since 1981 that
rate has not exceeded 44 percent.
   For many companies, he said, the direct impact of higher rates,
should they occur, isn't large. More important, he said, might be
the impact of higher rates on cash flow, since it might affect
customers and discourage buying.
   The survey is conducted among the more than 500,000 member
companies of the federation, which range in size from
proprietorships to a relatively small number of companies with sales
in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   What the federation does not represent is the top tier of perhaps
1,000 companies in terms of sales, such as those represented on the
Fortune 500 list of largest companies, and whose views are more
often sought in surveys.
   However, the federation points out that the economic segment
represented by its members employs about half the private, non-farm
work force and produces about 50 percent of the nation's goods and
services.
   Measuring economic sentiment from this half of the economy thus
involves a greater spread of business experience and opinion.

<HEAD>Civilian Politicians Seek Ways to Get Along With Chile's Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The political opposition is pursuing an
unprecedented dialogue with the armed forces, seeking a formula for
peaceful co-existence when Chile returns to civilian government in
March.
   The military, which has ruled since 1973, has indicated a
willingness to negotiate, but only under certain conditions.
   Both sides agree that the lack of communication in the past had
led to a mutual animosity and distrust that both sides agree must be
eliminated if the future government is to enjoy stability.
   Patricio Aylwin, the presidential candidate of a united
center-left opposition and heavily favored to win the presidential
election Dec. 14, recently remarked: ``We want an approach, an
exchange of views.''
   ``The isolation that has existed for years among civilians and
military is not good for the country and must end,'' Aylwin added.
``The time has come for a dialogue.''
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the right-wing army commander who has been
president since seizing power in September, 1973, was obliged to
call December's general elections after losing a referendum in
October on extending his rule to 1997.
   Aylwin and other opposition leaders want the dialogue to take
place before the new government takes office March 11.
   Experts expect several highly conflictive items will be on the
agenda.
   Ignacio Walker, a leading adviser to Aylwin on military matters,
said the talks would include the role of the armed forces under the
civilian government, the continuation of the present
commanders-in-chief in their posts, the defense budget and, probably
the most sensitive problem, how the new government will deal with
the human rights violations during Pinochet's rule.
   After the 1973 coup, which toppled the elected government of
Marxist Salvadoe Allende, the military launched a campaign of
political repression. Thousands of leftists were arrested, many were
tortured, killed or sent into exile. Human rights groups have
documented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared after
being arrested by seurity agents.
   The opposition has said that it will investigate all pending
cases of rights abuse and try those responsible.
   Its leaders have also said they will seek to repeal an amnesty
law, issued by Pinochet, that pardoned violations occurred from 1973
to 1978.
   That announcement by the opposition prompted a stern warning from
the military ranks. Gen. Fernando Matthei, the air force commander
who is considered politically moderate and has expressed support for
a dialogue, said repealing the amnesty law could unleash ``an
unpredictible reaction'' by the armed forces.
   ``Those wanting to repeal the law do not realize how serious that
could be,'' Matthei added.
   He noted that Pinochet himself has warned that an attempt to try
military officials could lead to an interruption of the democratic
transition.
   Opposition leaders have insisted they seek ``truth and justice,''
not vengeance against the military. They are under heavy political
pressure from human rights groups representing victims of repression
or their relatives.
   Another highly controversial subject is the constitutional clause
that allows the military chiefs, including Pinochet, to retain their
military commands under the civilian government. Pinochet has said
he will remain the army's leader for as long as the constitution
allows _ until 1998.
   Even some pro-government politicians contend the new leadership
must be empowered to make changes in the military command. But the
armed forces have vowed to make no concessions on the point. A
statement issued by the army warned the armed forces are prepared to
``use legitimate force'' to uphold constitution, which was drafted
by the military and approved in a referendum.
   And military commanders insist that their mission includes
ensuring internal stability as well as defending the country against
foreign attack. That is considered another potential area of
controversy, but opposition leaders say they are prepared to talk
about it, too, in spite of the risks and difficulties.
   ``The peaceful end of military dictatorships has never been easy,
and Chile cannot be an exception,'' wrote Rene Abeliuk, a Social
Democratic leader, in a newspaper column.
   The Roman Catholic Church also has urged civilians and military
to talk about their differences ``to help the transition to
democracy.''

<HEAD>Women See Hopeful Sign in West Berlin's Female-Majority Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women around the country see a new female-majority
government in West Berlin as a sign of a new age in West Germany and
a test case that could influence their political fortunes in the
future.
   Women hold eight of the 13 seats in the West Berlin Senate, the
city's governing body.
   While the coalition of leftist Social Democrats and
environmentalists has held together better than many had predicted
when it took office in March, it has been tainted by controversy.
   Anne Klein, the state minister for youth affairs, has been
accused of taking part in illegal gambling activities.
   Culture Minister Anke Martiny has come under fire in the press
following allegations that one of her women staffers misused office
contacts and mailing privileges to secure an apartment.
   But women defenders respond that what happened to the women is
nothing more than the kind of trouble men get into.
   ``I wouldn't want to understate the seriousness of such matters,
but it's fair to say that they are not problems specific to women
politicians,'' said Ingrid Hesse, a spokeswoman for the Social
Democratic Women's Organization, an arm of the Social Democratic
Party, which governs in coalition with an environmentalist group.
   ``The fact that a woman is discovered to have taken part in
something questionable doesn't detract from the undeniable
importance of this huge step forward for women,'' Ms. Hesse added.
   Peter Rudolph, a taxi driver in his 50s, tended to agree.
   ``People are always looking for excuses to complain about the
government, especially now with all those women,'' he said. ``They
aren't doing anything the male politicians weren't doing, but
everyone notices now.''
   The eight women senators caucus over croissants and coffee each
Tuesday morning in a ritual that has been called the ``Witches
Breakfast.''
   ``It is really quite productive, and it lets all these women blow
off steam so that it doesn't interfere with the whole Senate's
business,'' said Alice Uebe, chief adviser to Ms. Martiny and an
active the Social Democrat.
   The women are credited with pressing for changes aimed at
improving living conditions in this city of 2 million people tightly
ringed by communist East Germany.
   They have introduced measures to reduce air and noise pollution,
improve housing availability and to expand day-care opportunities
for the increasing numbers of West German women who work outside the
home.
   While many Berliners attribute the atmospheric changes to the
women's influence, they likewise are blamed for decisions and edicts
that don't sit well with the public.
   West Berlin's interior minister, Erich Paetzold, decided in July
to require that official correspondence be gender-neutral. For
example, a male resident is a Berliner, and a female is a
Berlinerin. The unisex term is BerlinerIn, with the second ``i''
capitalized.
   What has become known as the ``Big I'' decision has been widely
ridiculed as silliness resulting from the female majority in the
Senate. Hanna-Renate Laurien, a former senator of the out-of-power
Christian Democratic Union, called it ``perverse.''
   Monika Herrmann, one of the founding members of the women-only
Artemisia Hotel and art gallery in West Berlin, says the new
government has awakened the West German women's movement.
   But she and others also maintained that it has left some men
feeling defensive and threatened.
   ``For a long time many people have confused emancipation with
sexual alternativism,'' Ms. Herrmann said in an interview. ``Women
are doing things for themselves, and men fear their power is being
reduced.''
   A member of the city government's 35-women advisory council on
family and social affairs, Ms. Herrmann said the women in positions
of authority now recognize that they have to move carefully to
achieve what they want without undermining their electoral support.
   Meanwhile, women politicians in other parts of the country keep a
close eye on West Berlin to gauge their own standing with voters.
   ``The Berliners have given the situation for political women a
step up, but we are seeing this in other areas of the country as
well, in smaller cities,'' observed Ingrid Sehrbrock, director of
the Women's Union of the Christian Democatic Union. ``What kind of
example the Berlin coalition poses remains to be seen, but it has
certainly raised everyone's consciousness.''

<TEXT>
   BAN NON SAO-AE, Thailand (AP) _ The war has nothing to do with
them, but without warning it comes roaring in often on the 729
people of Ban Non Sao-Ae who make their living by farming.
   The war is Cambodia's _ government forces fighting rebels _ and
the villagers have the misfortune of living close to the border
where the fighting frequently breaks out with artillery barrages
that send shells crashing into Thailand.
   ``Bunker'' is one of the few English words that have worked their
where
also.''
   Dum Jankeja, 64, said he also will stay. Dum and his wife share a
bunker with three other households, and he said adversity has
brought the villagers closer.
   ``We have to go through this together. We help each other out. If
we go into the bunker, we go in together.''
   Less fortunate was Somwang Janpit, 22, one of at least three
villagers who recently lost legs to landmines.
   In June, he was searching for bamboo shoots in a deserted field.
He thought the blast he heard was someone shooting birds _ until he
saw his right leg was gone.
   ``Yes, I'm angry,'' he said. ``Now I can't take care of my father
and mother.''
   His mother, 63, now toils nine hours a day in the fields to feed
him, his handicapped sister and their father, 84.
   At the village school, anything that sounds like gunfire sends
the children dashing for the bunker on the compound. Heavy shelling
last year shattered several school buildings.
   But most students have learned to cope, a teacher said.
   ``Their homes are here in the village. When they hear it (the
shelling), they are scared. When it's over, they go and play like
children everywhere.''

   Islanders say there is a curse on
this mysterious 700 year-old ruined city they know as the Reef of
Heaven.
   The curse is so strong, they say, that no one will stay overnight.
   ``No way. The last person who stayed there was a German governor
about 100 years ago,'' said Bermin F. Wellbacher, director of
tourism and natural resources for Pohnpei, site of the city and one
of the three island states that make up the Federated States of
Micronesia. ``He was found mysteriously dead the next morning. You
wouldn't catch me there, no way.''
   But Wellbacher is more than happy for tourists to come in daytime
to see a stone megalith that is one of the wonders of the Pacific.
   It is the prime tourist attraction of this impoverished, remote
island 2,485 miles west of Honolulu.
   Few people know about Nan Mahdol. No one has fully explained how
it was built or who built it.
   Most Pacific islands never had a Stone age, but at Nan Mahdol the
walls are made of stone blocks that weight up to 50 tons.
Archaeologists believe the stones came from another island and
brought to the site on rafts. But how laborers were able to lift
them remains a mystery.
   It takes an hour by fast boat across a lagoon to reach the city.
At low tide visitors must wade through a sea grass swamp and climb
slippery rocks to the dark grey, moss-covered walls of the ruin.
   Nan Mahdol is a canal city built on 92 artificial islands 15
miles from Kolonia, the capital of Pohnpei.
   Built near the passage through the coral reef into the lagoon, it
covers 160 acres. Huge walls of basalt rock up to 20 feet high
enclose a deserted city with burial chambers, vaults made of giant
stone slabs and pathways of crushed coral.
   Scientists believe an advanced civilization built a seawall, a
priestly burial place, and adminstrative center, servants quarters,
a ceremonial center, a coconut-oil processing area and a
communications center where messages were sent by beating log drums.
   Carbon dating of the ruins indicates the city was built between
the years 1285 and 1485. Recent underwater archaeology suggests it
might be even older.
   Legend also says Nan Madol was created by magicians who then flew
off into space.
   Nowadays, people of Pohnpei are divided over who owns the city.
   The local paramount chief, Salvadore Hadley, claims it is his.
   The government also claims it.
   At stake is who gets the revenues from tourism.
   ``I don't ever want to see the day that a paramount chief and the
government are fighting one another in court,'' said Wellbacher the
tourism official. ``It goes against all our traditions. But it is
our greatest tourist asset.''
   Last year almost 8,000 tourists visited Pohnpei, a lush volcanic
island which in turn was ruled by Spain, Germany, Japan and the
United States.
   It is now the capital of Micronesia, made up of the islands of
Pohnpei, Truk and Kosrae, all formerly part of the U.S.-administered
United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
   Wellbacher wants to build a road to the shoreline near Nan Mahdol
to make the trip easier for tourists.
   He'd like to add a restaurant and souvenir shop.
   But no hotel.
   ``No one will stay overnight,'' Wellbacher said.

<HEAD>Chris Lemmon Pursues Dream in Fox Network's `Open House'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chris Lemmon has thrown over the pursuit of
money in Fox Network's ``Duet'' to chase his dream of becoming a
pianist in ``Open House.''
   It's not really a new show. In fact, it's as much a spinoff as
anything else. ``Duet'' has been revamped, given the new name ``Open
House'' and a largely new cast.
   Lemmon still plays Richard Phillips, but now he has different
goals. The focus has been moved to a real estate office where
Phillips' wife Linda, played by Alison La Placa, now works.
   ``It's about my wife coping with her new job as a real estate
saleswoman. I'm a guy who's given up millions of dollars to follow
his dream,'' Lemmon said.
   Last season, Richard quit his in his father's patio business.
``Linda was pregnant and Richard grew up and realized what was
important. They now have a young daughter. I think they changed the
show because Fox stepped in and ordered a change. They wanted
something more controversial with the wife working and supporting a
husband who is trying to find a new career.''
   It's partially a case of art imitating life. Lemmon, who has a
degree in classical piano and composing, had hoped to pursue his own
dream.
   ``It was a typical case of a man biting off more than he could
chew,'' said Lemmon. ``I wanted to be a pianist, a composer, then an
actor, a producer and a director. I still want to do all of them,
but in time.''
   During the summer, Lemmon and his wife, Gina Raymond, took off to
Massachusetts for the movie ``Dad,'' with Chris' father, Jack
Lemmon, and Olympia Dukakis. ``We play Pop and Olympia at the age of
35. I cut my hair (and) grew a mustache,'' Chris said.
   ``Gina went through a remarkable makeup transformation that made
her look like Olympia. I didn't think it was possible.''
   The Lemmons, father and son, previously appeared together in
``That's Life.''
   ``Pop and I are so significantly alike physically and
temperamentally that I think we can only play father and son. That
cuts down on the amount of work we can do together, which is tough
because we love working together.''
   The acting bug hit Lemmon rather late. He studied with his
father's acting coach, David Alexander, and in the comedy workshop
run by the late Harvey Lembeck.
   His first series was the short-lived ``Brothers and Sisters.'' He
appeared in some TV series and feature films, but his big break was
being named ``The Aramis Man'' in the TV commercials.
   Before his marriage he worked only enough to pay the bills and
support his skiing habit. ``One season I went to the slopes 55
times,'' he said. ``I sprained my thumb three times in one month. I
lived in a cheap apartment and 12 or so commercials that I could do
in two weeks would hold me for the year.
   ``What's more important? Your work or your life? I'm always
concerned about people who say a career is the most important thing
in their life. With me my wife and my family come first. I don't
think I could ever believe in the movie business ahead of my family.
   ``After that comes the health of this planet. Then the health of
the brothers and sisters on this planet. My career comes fourth.
It's left me happy and sound spiritually. It works for me.''
   Lemmon is also active in Greenpeace and Save the Whales.
   He is working with several partners on a small film about Robert
Schumann, the German composer.
   ``His wife Clara made the money while he stayed home with their
11 children and wrote music,'' he said.

   UAL Corp.'s stock price kept rising amid
unconfirmed reports that several suitors have expressed interest in
buying the airline company.
   UAL rose $1.50 to close at $258.50 a share Monday in New York
Stock Exchange trading. The increase followed a gain of about 56
percent last week following a $240-a-share takeover proposal to UAL,
parent of United Airlines, from Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis.
   The New York leveraged buyout firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co
and Forstmann Little &amp; Co. also reportedly have expressed interest
to UAL officials in buying the Chicago-based company, while
officials of New York-based Pan Am Corp. have stated they were
interested in a possible merger.

   Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in June
as business sales fell 0.3 percent, the government said. Analysts
said the report indicated slow but continued economic growth with
low inflation.
   Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as
production exceeds demand, a process that sometimes leads to a loss
of jobs as businesses cut their output. Economists, however, said
the inventories reported Monday are not unusually large in
proportion to sales.

he knew getting into instant photography could mean a lawsuit from
competitor Polaroid Corp. but said he was convinced his company
would win.
   Chandler was called to testify Monday in a U.S. District Court
trial to determine how many dollars in damages his company will have
to pay Polaroid. An earlier federal court decision established that
Kodak infringed on patents of Polaroid, the Cambridge, Mass.-based
pioneer of instant photography.
   Polaroid is seeking nearly $12 billion, while Kodak has argued it
should pay $177 million.

   Construction of houses, apartments and
condominiums fell 8 percent in the second quarter, according to the
F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co.
   Residential starts during the second three months of the year
totaled 388,926 units, down from 420,843 units during the same
period a year earlier, the McGraw-Hill Inc. division said Monday.
   The second-quarter construction rate was the lowest in more than
six years, the result of a surge in mortgage rates, George A.
Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge, said in
a news release.
   ``Although rates have fallen sharply since spring, building
activity will remain sluggish for a few more months until
inventories are pared down. We're looking for a fourth-quarter
pickup in housing starts,'' Christie said.
   Here is a list of the top 10 metropolitan areas in order of the
number of dwelling units started during the second quarter, followed
by the percentage change from a year earlier.
   1. Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., 12,729, down 20 percent.
   2. Washington, D.C., 12,325, down 6 percent.
   3. Los Angeles-Long Beach, Calif., 11,197, down 12 percent.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in several

week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.83 percent, up from 7.70 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.09
percent on July 24 and six-month bills averaged 8.08 percent on June

   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors

   The Federal Reserve's tight-money policy,
initiated last year to slow the economy and prevent inflation, has
achieved its desired effect, University of Michigan economic
research shows.
   An economic forecast prepared for release today predicts a ``soft
landing'' following the implementation of the policy and 3 percent
growth during 1990 with an unemployment rate of 5.7 percent.
   The forecast is based on a series of equations involving hundreds
of economic variables that comprise the Michigan Quarterly
Econometric Model of the U.S. Economy, also known as the Michigan
Model.
   Janet C. Wolfe, a University of Michigan economist who helped
prepare the forecast with Professor Saul H. Hymans and economist
Joan P. Crary, said the Federal Reserve's policy in part caused
economic growth to slow this year.
   ``The danger that runs in this type of policy is if the Fed
tightens too much ... growth might slow down or become negative, and
that would be a recession,'' Wolfe said.
   She said the U.S. Department of Commerce's most recent
measurement showed that the economy is growing at a rate of 1.7
percent this year. The forecast indicates continued sluggishness but
a pickup during 1990.
   ``While we expect slow growth for the remainder of this year ...
we do not expect a recession,'' Wolfe said. ``We expect renewed
growth during 1990. That is contingent upon easing of the Fed toward
the end of this year.''
   According to the forecast, inflation is expected to hold steady
at 4.4 percent in 1989 and 1990, then creep up to 4.5 percent in
1991. The gross national product will grow by 2.6 percent in 1989,
2.2 percent in 1990 and 2.9 percent in 1991, according to the
forecast.
   Civilian unemployment is forecast to edge up from 5.3 percent in
1989 to 5.7 percent in 1990 and 5.8 percent in 1991. Automobile
sales are predicted to hold steady at 10 million per year through
the forecast period, a decline from the 10.6 million units sold in
1988. Housing starts are expected to rebound from 1.4 million units
in 1989 to 1.7 million units in 1991.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating whether USA Today financial columnist Dan Dorfman
wittingly or unwittingly was used by individuals who gave him
information in order to manipulate stock prices, according to U.S.
News &amp; World Report.
   The SEC investigation deals with Centaur Partners, a
Maryland-based investment partnership that Dorfman has written about
repeatedly in the past 14 months, the weekly news magazine reports
in its Aug. 21 issue, quoting unidentified sources.
   The SEC is investigating whether Centaur, in establishing initial
positions in several prominent companies, may be manipulating the
market in the companies' stock, U.S. News said.
   When Dorfman reported that Centaur bought shares in these
companies, the companies' stock price rose. The question is whether
Centaur is selling shares in these companies to investors, leaving
those investors holding the bag when takeover bids don't
materialize, the magazine reported.
   Maryland businessman Melvyn Estrin, president of one of the
limited partnerships that make up Centaur, denied to the magazine
that Centaur tried to manipulate stock prices or that it ever gave
Dorfman any information.
   Dorfman also denied that he had been a party to any manipulation.
   ``I'm so careful and sensitive about what I do,'' he said Monday
night when reached at his home for comment.
   Dorfman, who also is a commentator on Cable News Network's
``Moneyline'' program, said he knew nothing about any investigation.
   ``I have not been contacted by the SEC, the New York Stock
Exchange or anybody else,'' he said. ``I think it's a lot of crap.''
   Tom Petruno, Dorfman's editor at USA Today, also said he knew of
no investigation.
   ``We have no idea where U.S. News got this information or who its
sources are,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the SEC told the magazine that the agency could
not confirm or deny any such investigation.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Share Prices Also Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar climbed today against the Japanese
yen for the fourth consecutive trading day, and share prices on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange also gained.
   The dollar closed at 142.20 yen, up 0.27 yen from Monday's close
of 141.93 yen. It opened at 142.40 yen and moved between 142.20 yen
and 142.70 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 3.35 yen over the last four trading
days.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which declined
41.34 points Monday, climbed 139.07 points, or 0.40 percent, on
Tuesday, closing at 34,810.69.
   The dollar opened higher following a rising trend overseas and
moved upward during the morning session.
   At one point, the Bank of Japan sold about $200 million in
efforts to check the dollar's rise, said a dealer from Mitsubishi
Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dollar-buying cooled in the afternoon, he added.
   A trader at Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities said stock trading
was relatively brisk even though many market participants are taking
summer vacations this week.
   ``Even though the volume was only 400 million shares, the cost of
the amount bought and sold was much higher than that traded at the
same time last year,'' he said.
   The trader said the buying of high-priced stocks such as Sony and
TDK, which had been the focus of Monday's trading, had ended during
the morning.
   Steel shares attracted buyer attention for some time, he added.

<HEAD>With PM-SEC-Breeden Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When you ask people about Richard C. Breeden,
the savvy Washington lawyer nominated to head the Securities and
Exchange Commission, they always start off by calling him ``very
intelligent'' or ``extremely bright.''
   ``He has the experienced, good mind that will stand him in good
stead,'' former SEC Chairman Roderick M. Hills said Monday after the
nomination of Breeden, an architect of the savings and loan industry
bailout, was announced.
   Even people who question the wisdom of the appointment, like Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich, start their criticism with ``Mr.
Breeden is highly intelligent and did fine work on the S&amp;L reform
package ...''
   One industry source, who did not wish to be identified, said that
because of his keen mind Breeden does not ``suffer fools gladly''
and could be abrasive.
   But when Breeden was gathering information for a task force
chaired by then-Vice President George Bush, on what financial
regulatory rules needed to be amended or scrapped, said the source,
``We sent him some very difficult, complicated stuff.
   ``Usually, people in that position read it and don't understand
it or pass it on to someone else to read it. But when we met with
him it was obvious he had read it and understood it all.''
   Industry observers believe Breeden's wide-ranging experience will
be an asset in the SEC position.
   ``He comes to this job with a fairly broad knowledge of the
financial services industry,'' said Joseph R. Hardiman, president of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees
over-the-counter stock trading.
   A 1972 graduate of Stanford University and a 1975 graduate of
Harvard Law School, Breeden practiced securities law on Wall Street
with the prestigious firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. He also worked
for the Washington office of the politically powerful Texas law firm
Baker &amp; Botts.
   From 1981-82, Breeden was an executive assistant to the
undersecretary of labor.
   ``He's been a practitioner. He's been in government. He knows
banking,'' said the industry source. ``He may get rid of a lot of
junk along the way but he'll be doing his job.''
   The White House announcement ended months of speculation about
who would succeed departing SEC Chairman David S. Ruder who
announced in May he was stepping down.
   In contrast to Ruder, 60, an academic and legal expert who
managed to keep his distance from the free-market philosophy of the
Reagan administration, Breeden, 39, is known as a fierce fighter for
the policies of George Bush.
   Breeden helped write the Bush plan for bailing out the nation's
ailing savings and loan industry and then shepherded through
Congress the plan to spend more than $150 billion over three decades
to deal with the nation's biggest money problem since the Depression.
   Before that, Breeden, a Manhattan Beach, Calif., native who now
lives in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington, worked for and
with Bush in a number of capacities.
   Breeden, now a presidential assistant for issues analysis, also
helped fashion administration policy in dealing with the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
   He helped candidate Bush prepare for the 1988 presidential
debates with Michael Dukakis.
   From 1982 to 1985, he was deputy counsel to Bush as vice
president. Breeden also served as staff director on the task force
Bush chaired to reform the financial regulatory system.
   ``I'm not sure if he's a regulator or a deregulator,'' said
Gordon Macklin, chief executive officer of the San Francisco
investment banking firm of Hambrecht and Quist.
   Macklin, who has known Breeden since 1984, said the wiry and
intense lawyer is `` interested in efficient, cost effective
regulation. He knows the inter-relationships in the world of
financial services, he has a broad view of what's out there and an
extensive knowledge.''

   A striking telephone worker was critically injured in a picket
line accident, and the only contract talks between unions and four
strikebound regional telephone companies failed to make any gains.
   Meanwhile, customers of the four Baby Bell companies continued to
experience minor delays on operator-assisted calls, but a union
spokesman said the strike by more than 190,000 employees would bite
harder in time.
   ``The strike certainly has not seriously affected service,'' Jim
O'Hare, president of Local 1118 of the Communications Workers of
America in Albany, N.Y., said Monday.
   ``But we know that after a while these machines that are running
will show signs of lack of maintenance. You'll see more trouble as
time goes on,'' he said.
   CWA workers were in the second week of a strike against New
York-based NYNEX Corp., Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic and San
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis. Union members at Ameritech, which
has its headquarters in Chicago, joined the walkout Sunday.
   Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
also are on strike at NYNEX, Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic. The
strikes affected customers in 20 states and the District of Columbia.
   Bell Atlantic representatives presented a revised proposal to
union officials at an hour-long meeting Monday, but CWA spokesman
Jim Willer said the company's health insurance offer was
``unacceptable.'' Willer said the company continued to demand that
workers pay deductibles plus half the premiums for relatives other
than spouses and children.
   Efforts to shift some health care costs onto workers are a key
issue in the four strikes.
   The three other regional phone companies _ Atlanta-based
BellSouth, Denver-based US West and St. Louis-based Southwestern
Bell _ have reached settlements. The seven Baby Bells were formed in
the 1984 breakup of American Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co.
   No talks were scheduled at Ameritech, which serves 12.3 million
customers in five Midwestern states.
   CWA officials in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin
said their bargaining committees would meet Thursday in Detroit to
plot strategy before seeking any talks with Ameritech subsidiaries
in their states.
   ``I don't expect any talks before the end of the week,'' said L.
Keith Dooley, co-chairman of the Indiana bargaining committee.
``Right now I would say we're still a long ways off from getting a
contract.''
   Ameritech subsidiaries have offered a three-year contract with an
immediate increase of 5 percent, most of which would come in the
form of a $1,000 signing bonus for lower-paid employees. Base wages
would increase 2 percent in 1990 and 1991, said Larry Cose, a
spokesman for Illinois Bell.
   The CWA said the offer would do little for lower-paid operators
and clerks.
   ``The base pay has to increase enough to make it worthwhile for
people to work there,'' said Greg Kenefick, a CWA spokesman in
Cleveland.
   Meanwhile, NYNEX picket Edward G. Horgan, 34, was hospitalized in
critical condition after a picket line accident in the New York
suburb of Mount Pleasant.
   Police Chief Paul Oliva said an 18-year-old NYNEX employee was
driving on the service road of a NYNEX facility when her car brushed
Horgan, after he and several other pickets gathered around her car
and yelled at her.
   Horgan mounted the hood of the slowly moving car and pounded on
the windshield, but slid off and hit his head on the pavement,
police said. The union disputed that, saying he fell onto the hood
and the young woman accelerated. No charges were filed.
   New York Telephone Co. President Fred Salerno called the accident
``tragic'' and asked the union to resume negotiations ``to try and
calm the waters.''
   In other incidents:
   _ A NYNEX car was burned shortly after midnight Monday in a
company parking lot in Elmont, N.Y. Police said the fire was
suspicious.
   _ Four strikers were arrested at a New York Telephone facility in
Catskill, 40 miles south of Albany, when they ignored police
barricades.
   _ Two people were arrested outside Michigan Bell offices in the
Detroit suburb of Southfield. Officer Gary Conat said one allegedly
obstructed a police officer, but he wasn't sure about allegations
against the other.
   _ Toll and 911 service was cut off to about 8,000 customers in
West Virginia after vandals cut 11 cables. Residents in the area are
still able to dial police or fire directly, C&amp;P Telephone of West
Virginia said.

   The price of UAL Corp. shares continued to rise
with unconfirmed reports that several additional suitors were
interested in aquiring the airline company.
   UAL rose $1.50 to $258.50 a share Monday in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The increase followed a gain of some 56 percent
last week following a $240 a share takeover proposal to UAL, parent
of United Airlines, from Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis.
   The New York leveraged buyout firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
and Forstmann Little &amp; Co. also reportedly have expressed interest
in buying the company, while officials of New York-based Pan Am
Corp. have stated they were interested in a possible merger.
   ``It basically says the sophisticated players in the market ...
believe that there will be other bidders for the company,'' said
Robert Joedicke, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. He said the amount of money that will be needed to take over
UAL limits the number of potential bidders.
   ``It's not something anybody and everybody will become involved
in,'' Joedicke said.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in its editions today that the
airline, which is negotiating on a new contract with its pilots
union, is also considering a possible management-led employee buyout.
   Weekend talks between UAL and the pilots apparently were aimed at
determining whether the airline's unions might agree to enough
concessions to make an employee buyout bid viable, the Journal said.
UAL would also have to win the support of the machinists union and
other employees.
   United's pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying
the company.
   Kathy Hardin, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association
unit at United, said Monday the union's financial and legal advisers
were studying efforts to take over the company.
   UAL spokesman Robert Doughty said today the airline had no
comment on the report. ``It is our policy not to confirm or deny
negotiations,'' he said.
   Analysts have said UAL could fetch as much as $6.75 billion and
prospective bids likely would include a management buyout plan.
   The Journal has quoted officials it did not name as saying UAL
had received nibbles from several groups, including companies that
showed interest in Eagan, Minn.-based NWA Inc., parent of Northwest
Airlines.
   In addition to Davis; Kohlberg Kravis, Forstmann Little and Pan
Am were among those who unsuccessfully made takeover proposals for
NWA, which was sold to a group headed by Los Angeles investor Alfred
Checchi for $3.65 billion.
   Officials of UAL refused to comment Monday on the report of
additional bidders.
   ``We neither confirm or deny any other bids,'' UAL spokesman
Doughty said Monday.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts also remained silent on the issue.
   ``The firm has said nothing and haven't made any comment'' on
whether it is interested in acquiring UAL, said spokesman Tom Daly.
   Officials of Forstmann Little also declined comment.
   Pan Am said it would make an offer if UAL's board asked it to.
   ``They have not publicly said they were up for sale,'' said Pan
Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners. ``My understanding is that they
did say they were going to explore some alternative.''
   Last week, in response to Davis' overture, UAL's board of
directors announced it would explore all possible financial and
strategic alternatives open to the company.

diminished chances that the Federal Reserve would lower interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.07 points to finish at

   Corn and soybean futures opened higher today on
the Chicago Board of Trade after getting a boost from the National
Weather Service's 30-day forecast.
   The forecast issued Monday called for below-normal precipit`tion
and above-norlal temperatures in major crop areas.
   An Agriculture Department report that noted some detdrioration in
soybean crop quality may have contributed to today's early gains.
   Analysts said the good showing in the soybean and corn pits
should spill over into the wheat market.
   Wheat also should get support from Algeria's bid for U.S. wheat
under the export bonus program, which subsidizds grain sales to
foreign nations, the analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.99{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 3\ cents higher with September at $2.31 a bushel; oats were
} cent to 2 cents higher with September at $1.38 a bushel; soybeans
were 3{ cents to 11{ cents higher with August at $6.14 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .23 cent lower with August at 74.37
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .27 cent lower with
August at 84.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent to .37 cent
lower with August at 47.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.40 cent to .60 cent a pound with August at 24.75 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mostly lower and pork futures were
mixed in Monday's trading.

   The Federal Reserve isn't likely to lower
interest rates any time soon to boost economic growth, despite a
pointed warning of recession from President Bush's budget director,
many economists say.
   Analysts predicted Monday that interest rates will hold steady
because the central bank is satisfied it has done all it needs to
keep the country out of an economic slump.
   Those economists suggested that comments by Budget Director
Richard Darman might actually backfire and make the central bank
less inclined to ease credit conditions for fear of appearing to bow
to political pressure.
   Darman complained that the central bank was keeping interest
rates too high and would shoulder the blame if the country falls
into a recession.
   ``If we do have a recession, I think it will be because they
erred on the side of caution'' in fighting inflation by keeping
interest rates too high, Darman said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
   The White House tried to soften the sting from Darman's message
by praising the Fed on Monday for generally doing a ``good job'' but
Bush today generally endorsed the comments during a morning press
conference.
   Bush praised Darman for expressing his views, which he called
``very balanced.''
   ``I feel very comfortable with his (Darman's) sallying forth,''
Bush said. ``I think I have said the same things in the past.''
   Bush said he did not know of any president who had ever come out
against lower interest rates, but he stopped short of saying that he
believed that if a recession did occur, it would be the fault of the
central bank.
   Private economists were surprised by the timing of Darman's
criticism, given recent economic statistics such as a drop in the
jobless rate in August that suggest the economy isn't as sluggish as
previously feared.
   ``There is virtually no chance that we will have a recession this
year. So why stir up this fuss and get financial markets unsettled
when you don't have to?'' asked Michael Evans, head of a Washington
forecasting company.
   But other economists said they believed Darman was positioning
the Fed to take the blame if the economy does weaken and the country
ends up in a recession right before next year's congressional
elections.
   ``This is a classic situation of setting up the Fed to be the
fall guy if something goes wrong,'' said Robert Dederick, chief
economist at Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Dederick and other economists said it was unlikely that Darman's
remarks would have any impact on upcoming Fed decisions. Top Fed
policymakers will meet again in Washington on Aug. 22.
   Many economists said they expected the central bank to hold
interest rates steady and not ease further given recent signs that
certain key sectors, such as consumer spending, are rebounding.
   ``So long as the economy is OK, there is no reason for the Fed to
ease any more,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   From March 1988 through March 1989, the Federal Reserve pushed
short-term interest rates higher in an anti-inflation campaign. The
Fed reversed course in June and has made three modest moves to lower
interest rates by making more money available to the banking system.
   Banks have been able to cut their prime lending rate since early
June by a full percentage point to 10.5 percent. Home mortgage rates
have declined as well, dropping below 10 percent to stand at 9.96
percent for fixed-rate loans.
   Sinai said he believed mortgage rates have hit their low for the
year and may even climb by about one-fourth percentage point in
coming weeks as financial markets realize that the central bank has
decided to hold off on further easing moves.
   Paul Getman, senior economist at the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., consulting company, said the Fed was correct to pause before
driving interest rates any lower.
   He said if economic activity turns out to be stronger in the
second half of the year than forecast, the Fed would run the risk of
triggering higher inflation next year by loosening credit conditions
too rapidly.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market slipped from earlier highs and
turned mixed in moderate trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.36 points to
2,682.28 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 6.64 points an
hour earlier.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by a margin of about 10 to
9 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 657 issues down, 611 up and
555 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 72.99 million shares.
   Analysts said the market opened higher in response to a firming
bond market after declining on Monday.
   The stock market has moved in tandem with bonds since Friday,
when the credit market plunged in response to a rise in retail sales
that renewed inflationary concerns and diminished hopes that
interest rates would go lower.
   But the stock market began to slip late this morning in what
analysts said was a continuation of the correction phase after its
recent runup.
   The market has climbed more than 10 percent since late June and
about 30 percent since last fall. Wall Street analysts say the
current market is now overbought and could drift for several
sessions before resuming an upward march.
   ``We could see some more zigzagging today without any sustained
movement either way until the market works out the overbought
condition,'' said Philip Roth, analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.16 at 191.53.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index stood at
379.05, a gain of 0.05.

<HEAD>Chrysler Tentative Car Prices Up Average of 5 Percent for '90</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: AMer planned.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said today tentative
prices for its 1990 cars will increase an average of 5 percent over
comparably equipped 1989 models.
   Nearly half the boost is caused by the installation of
driver-side air bags in all of Chrysler's U.S.-made cars, expected
to be about 1 million vehicles in the 1990 model year, spokeswoman
Karen Stewart said.
   She said the average air bag will cost a consumer $450, less than
what Chrysler pays to buy and install them. She refused to say
exactly what the automaker is spending on the systems.
   The rest of Chrysler's price increase stems from economic
reasons, including higher material and labor costs, she said.
   The federal government requires driver-side air bags or automatic
seat belts on all cars made in the United States after Sept. 1.
   Earlier this month, General Motors Corp. announced a tentative
average price increase of 3.4 percent and Ford Motor Co. said its
car prices could go up as much as 4.8 percent for the coming model
year.
   Stewart said a few of the 1990-model cars offered by the nation's
No. 3 automaker will decrease in price while the rest will increase
between 2.8 percent and 6.9 percent. She said she did not have a
list of all models and their price increases.
   Chrysler's final retail prices will be announced in September or
October, she said.

<HEAD>Computer Software Maker Announces Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Software maker Ashton-Tate Corp. said
Tuesday it would lay off at least 15 percent of its employees, or
about 260 workers, and cut other costs in the face of expected
additional losses.
   Last month, Ashton-Tate reported a $19.8 million second-quarter
net loss on revenue of $59.5 million. Its president and chief
operating officer, Luther J. Nussbaum, resigned and his duties were
assumed by board chairman Edward M. Esber Jr.
   ``The (workforce) reduction will be a minimum of 15 percent,''
according to Ashton-Tate spokeswoman Linda Duttenhayer, who said the
company now has 1,731 employees worldwide.
   Ashton-Tate, once a top manufacturer of computer software,
recently has faced intense competition in its core business of
software for the storage and retrieval of information in personal
computers.
   It said reduced revenues, together with anticipated job-cutting
costs and other expenses, may result in a larger operating loss for
the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30, than in the second quarter
that ended June 30.
   The company said its previously announced program to reduce
inventories on the shelves of U.S. distributors and resellers is
continuing.
   Ashton-Tate also is going through a transition to a newer version
of its dBASE IV software, and said shipments of the current version
are expected to decline as customers wait for the new version.
   Esber said he will directly oversee the database business.
   ``This is another important step in restoring Ashton-Tate's
profitability,'' Esber said. ``The company's cost-reduction program
will result in greater focus and execution on projects with the
biggest impact on near-term revenues.''

<HEAD>Penney, Dayton Hudson Post Earnings Gains for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said Tuesday that improved sales in its
fashion apparel business helped it post a 21.2 percent profit
increase in the second quarter, while earnings doubled for another
retailer, Dayton Hudson Corp.
   The Dallas-based Penney reported it earned $98 million, or 74
cents per share, in the three months ended July 29, compared with
$81 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 5.1 percent to $3.51 billion from
$3.34 billion.
   ``We expect to build on the current strong sales momentum,
particularly in apparel lines, during the second half,'' said Penney
Chairman William R. Howell. ``Our significant sales growth has shown
that our reputation for fashion apparel is growing.''
   In the first half of the year, Penney earned $226 million, or
$1.71 per share, up 6.8 percent from $212 million, or $1.57 a share,
a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 4.5 percent to $6.92 billion from $6.62
billion a tear earlier.
   From Minneapolis, Dayton Hudson said it earned a record $56
million, or 72 cents a share, in the three months ended July 29, up
from $28 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue increased 15 percent to $3.10 billion from
$2.69 billion a year ago.
   ``Strong performance by our three major operating companies led
to the record earnings,'' Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief
executive of Dayton Hudson, said in a statement.
   Its Mervyn's chain had an 18 percent increase in revenue from the
1988 second quarter, followed by Target stores at 17 percent and
Dayton Hudson Department Store Co. at 7 percent. Lechmere stores'
revenue was about the same as during last year's second quarter, the
company said.
   Pretax earnings were $10 million higher than they otherwise would
have been because costs related to the closing of its Branden's
stores were higher than the company had provided for in the fourth
quarter 1988.
   Six-month net earnings rose 62.7 percent to $96 million, or $1.23
per share, versus $59 million, or 70 cents a share, for the same
period in 1988. Revenue for the first six months increased 13
percent to $5.92 billion from $5.24 billion a year ago.
   Dayton Hudson operates 675 stores in 38 states.

<HEAD>Sara Lee Posts Record Sales, Earnings for Quarter and Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sara Lee Corp. on Tuesday announced record
fourth-quarter sales of $3.06 billion and earnings of $102.7
million, led by strong performances by the hosiery and underwear
companies in its personal-products division.
   The sales figure represented a 5.5 percent increase over the $2.9
billion recorded in the year-earlier period, while earnings were up
17.9 percent over the $87.1 million logged in the final quarter of
1988. Per-share earnings rose to 86 cents from 75 cents.
   For the fiscal year ended July 1, sales were $11.7 billion, a
12.4 percent increase from $10.4 billion in 1988, and net income
rose 26.3 percent to $410.5 million from last year's $325.1 million.
Earnings per share to $3.50 from $2.83 a year earlier.
   While most consumers still associate the Chicago-based
conglomerate with pastries, the Sara Lee bakery division showed only
a 6 percent increase in volume for the year.
   By comparison, sales were up 20 percent and earnings 28 percent
for the personal products division, led by such companies as Haines
Underwear and L'eggs hosiery.
   ``That wouldn't come as a surprise to market analysts or the
investment community,'' said company spokesman Ronald Culp. ``That's
been the area of strongest growth in recent years.''
   The fiscal-year earnings also reflected a pretax gain of
approximately $87 million as Sara Lee sold its Hollywood Brands,
Lyon's and Peck Foods subsidiaries. Earnings also were affected by a
$55 million charge for restructuring of the U.S. food operations.

   Contempt charges have been dismissed against
a nun accused of delaying coal trucks during a miners' strike by
driving slowly.
   Sister Bernadette Kenny was among several people charged July 12
in Dickenson County with impeding Pittston Coal Group trucks in
violation of a court order. The United Mine Workers have been on
strike against Pittston since April 5.
   U.S. District Judge Jackson Kiser on Monday ruled that the
government had failed to show that the truck behind the nun's motor
home was a Pittston vehicle.
   The nun, who was delivering medical supplies at the time of her
arrest, said she was not trying to block coal trucks but was driving
slowly because of the size of her vehicle and the narrow, winding
road.

<HEAD>Workers Retake Assembly Plants Closed By Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of workers tore down black and
red strike flags, unlocked gates and poured back to their jobs
Tuesday at American-owned assembly plants closed over a union power
struggle.
   ``We're waiting for the other union to come and try to take us
out,'' said Alberto de la Torre, 22, an assembly line worker at the
Nibco valve plant in this northern border city.
   ``We've been inactive for three weeks. We need our jobs,'' said
Marco Antonio Becerra, a Nibco section chief.
   Maquiladoras are foreign-owned plants that take advantage of
Mexico's lower wage rates to assemble products to sell in the United
States.
   About 900 workers, both men and women, defied a rival union and,
unlocking gates, reopened 15 American plants closed July 25 when one
union leader attempted to take control from another.
   Rafael Morales put up strike banners and locked the gates of
plants organized under leader Abel Hernandez.
   About 2,000 workers were idled by the strike, although they said
the companies continued to pay their salaries.
   Morales argued that Hernandez no longer could legally represent
the workers because Hernandez had withdrawn from the Federation of
Mexican Laborers, or CTM.
   But the workers said Tuesday that they want Hernandez as their
union leader whether or not he's allied with the CTM.
   They're tired, they said, of waiting for government and judicial
authorities to end the strike.
   ``We want the government to intervene. We want them to respect
the contract we have with Hernandez,'' said Aurelio Veraza, a Nibco
supervisor.
   Hernandez, who had called for workers to return to their jobs,
said Tuesday that he did so because ``they don't have any reason to
stay out.''
   Morales was not immediately available for comment.
   No American manager was on the premises of any of the plants as
the workers calmly walked past the two or three guards at each gate.
   Once inside, each person went to work at his or her station,
taking orders only from the supervisors involved in the retaking of
the plants.
   The workers contend that Morales acted illegally when he forced
the plants closed.
   ``Only workers have the right to strike,'' said Veraza. ``We're
happy with the work the Americans give us. They're giving us chances
to advance.''
   The state labor arbitration board had ruled in favor of Morales,
but the plants took the case to federal court asking that Hernandez
be declared the official representative.
   The federal court has yet to issue a ruling in the case.
   All the workers interviewed said they expected Morales supporters
to attempt to remove them from the plants.
   No action had been taken by the rival union, however, hours after
the plants reopened.
   Two American companies, Invacare Corp. of Elyria, Ohio, and
Pilling de Mexico of Pennsylvania, have said they'll pull out of
Mexico before being forced to sign a contract with Morales.
   And the workers said Tuesday that they're concerned that if the
plants aren't in operation, they'll close down.
   ``If the plants close down nobody is going to make sure we have
jobs. We're not taking action against anybody. We just want to hold
on to our jobs,'' said Nibco's Alonso Rivera.
   Salinas has not made a statement favoring one union leader or the
other.
   Plant managers have made several trips to Mexico City seeking an
end to the conflict through the federal government.
   No decision had come Tuesday from either the courts or government
officials.
   Don King, plant manager for the newly opened West Bend plant,
said Tuesday that the workers' action proves their loyalty to
Hernandez.
   ``It's a loud signal from the Mexican people to the government
that they want their jobs and they want to work and work under the
representation of Abel Hernandez,'' said King, contacted in at the
Economic Development Corp. in McAllen, Texas, just across the border
from Reynosa.
   Asked when the American managers would return to the plants, King
said, ``We have to wait and see what happens. We are continuing to
try to solve this legally.''

<HEAD>Deteriorated Soybean and Corn Crop Boosts Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, with the rise triggered by reports of
deteriorating crop conditions.
   Monday's crop ratings from the Department of Agriculture showed a
decline in the condition of the soybean crop, particularly in Iowa
and Illinois, due to lack of moisture.
   ``There was also a strike overnight in Brazil,'' said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc. in Chicago. ``While it did
not affect Brazilian soybean shipments, the psychology of that
didn't hurt the beans.''
   Soybean prices were also supported by the National Weather
Service's 30-day forecast _ released Monday _ which calls for
below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures.
   Corn futures were boosted by the announcement that Mexico would
be in the market for 400,000 metric tons of corn and rumors that the
Soviet Union would also enter the market.
   Wheat futures were helped by light commercial purchases by
Algeria and carryover from the other markets, Gidel said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.99 a bushel; corn was 2{
cents to 5} cents higher with September at $2.33{ a bushel; oats
were 3{ cents to 3} cents higher with September at $1.40 a bushel;
soybeans were 7 cents to 15 cents higher with August at $6.17{ a
bushel.

<HEAD>Cable Giant Posts Larger Loss in 2nd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest
cable television systems operator, said Tuesday its second-quarter
loss widened to $63.6 million, citing higher interest expenses and
increased losses by its affiliates.
   The company's loss for the three months ended June 30 was three
times larger than its $21.9 million loss in the second quarter of
1988.
   Revenue for the second quarter rose 31.8 percent to $726.4
million from $551.0 million in the second quarter of 1988.
   The company said the increase in revenue was due to new cable
television subscribers, increases in rates and acquisitions.
   TCI said its operating income rose to $142.6 million from $125.4
million a year earlier.
   Interest expenses, however, climbed to $205.9 million from $138.8
million a year earlier, and its share of losses by affiliates rose
to $29.7 million from $400,000 in the second quarter of 1988.
   ``Consummation of the purchase of a 42.5 percent indirect
interest in SCI Holdings Inc. and the business combination involving
United Cable Television Corp. and United Artists Communications Inc.
have had a negative impact on TCI's earnings due to the cost of
servicing the indebtedness incurred to finance the transactions and
the resulting increase in depreciation and amortization,'' the
company said.
   For the first six months of the year, TCI recorded a net loss of
$115 million compared with a loss of $29.2 million in the first half
of 1988.
   Six-month revenue rose 31.4 percent to $1.38 billion from $1.05
billion a year earlier.

   Eastern Airlines, trying to rebuild from a crippling
strike and financial problems, on Tuesday expanded its schedule and
cut its already discounted fares while adding the lure of refundable
tickets.
   A union leader, meanwhile, said the new fare cuts for fall travel
by Eastern's healthier competitors would badly hurt Eastern's
efforts to rebuild without its unions.
   The discounts of up to $160 on a roundtrip fare were announced
Sunday by Trans World Airways and matched over the next two days by
carriers including Eastern, Delta Air Lines, Pan American World
Airways, United Airlines, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines,
Continental Airlines and USAir Group.
   George Brennan, Eastern's vice president for marketing, said
Eastern had already planned new discounts before the other carriers
and he said Eastern's fall promotion offers tickets that ``are much
easier to use and a much better value in most cases.''
   Besides competitive rates, Brennan said, Eastern's discounted
fares, beginning Sept. 7, have fewer restrictions and unlike the
other carriers, allow full refunds on unused tickets.
   ``We've been ... planning a major initiative for some time. Our
fares are very, very different. Our fares are like going to an ATM
(automatic teller machine) and theirs are like trying to get a
mortgage,'' Brennan said.
   Eastern will require only three- to-seven-day advance purchase
and its low fares are available nearly every day and carry no
restrictive penalties.
   The fares will affect all domestic markets, Eastern said.
   The carrier increased Tuesday from 350 to 390 daily flights by
adding 40 flights connecting Atlanta and destinations mostly in the
South and said it would fly 600 daily flights starting Sept. 7.
Eastern's rebuilding plan proposed to its creditors calls for 800
daily flights by year's end and an airline about two-thirds its
pre-strike size.
   While Eastern says it has hired enough new pilots and is keeping
up with maintenance despite its strike, it has been leasing five
planes and crews from sister carrier Continental Airlines. Brennan
said more planes and crews will be leased from Continental, owned by
Texas Air Corp. as is Eastern, to meet the September expansion but
that the practice is only temporary.
   Eastern union leaders, in their sixth month on strike, say the
airline's claims to be coming back are misleading because their
fares, as low as $39 one way, make it impossible to make money.
   ``The more they fly, the more they lose,'' Machinists District
100 President Charles Bryan told a rally in Miami on Saturday.
   Matell said Eastern's priority is winning back customers and the
company is pleased at 75 percent load figures as its tries to come
out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   ``Indications are we're getting a warm welcome back,'' Matell
said. ``That's not to say that after a 5-month strike operating 10
percent of our service that there isn't a major challenge in
rebuilding the airline.
   ``You have to first win back your customer base. We said in our
business plan we would lose hundreds of millions of dollars between
the comeback and the end of the year,'' Matell said.
   Bryan said in an interview Tuesday that consumers are going to go
with the other airlines because ``they are very reliable, first-line
carriers. They're not having phantom flights and people don't have
to worry about losing their money.
   ``If Eastern tries to go even lower than the rest of the
carriers, that's just going to compound their problems. It's going
to doom the rebuilding plan, which was already doomed,'' Bryan said.
   Before the strike that started March 4, Eastern normally had
around $1 billion in revenue per quarter. Last quarter, Eastern
posted $89.6 million in revenue.
   Management last week hurdled a major barrier to its rebuilding
efforts when a split in pilots union ranks resulted in at least 250
more pilots returning to work, boosting to 650 the union crossovers.
Eastern said with its own recruitment and training program it now
has the 1,700 pilots needed for its rebuilding plan.
   Eastern is still hiring flight attendants and mechanics to
replace strikers.
   The unions are backing a buyout bid by Chicago businessman Joseph
Ritchie and are lobbying in Washington for presidential and
congressional intervention.

   The dollar ended mixed in choppy trading Tuesday
following a modest rise overseas.
   Gold prices firmed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery closed up $3.60 at $370.70 a troy
ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold
at $368.50 an ounce, up $3.80 from Monday.
   Dealers said the dollar remained locked into a fairly narrow
trading range in anticipation of new data that should shed more
light on the economy and the short-term outlook for U.S. interest
rates.
   The government is scheduled to release reports on industrial
activity and housing starts for July on Wednesday, merchandise trade
in June on Thursday, and the consumer price index on Friday.
   Some economists are predicting those reports will show continued
economic growth, lessening the possibility of lower interest rates.
   The dollar has been boosted in recent days on speculation that
interest rates won't fall any time soon. When rates remain firm,
dollar-denominated securities, such as bonds, become more attractive
to foreigners, and that increases the need for those investors to
exchange their currencies for dollars.
   The dollar headed higher in Europe, although trading was subdued
Tuesday due to the closing of markets in France, Italy and Belgium
in observance of the Assumption Day religous holiday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose for the fourth consecutive trading day to 142.20
Japanese yen from 141.93 yen. It traded at 142.30 yen in London and
at 142.15 yen in New York, up from 141.925 Monday.
   The British pound weakened in London, falling to $1.5735 from
$1.5840 late Monday. Sterling fetched $1.5768 in New York, down from
$1.5770.
   Other dollar rates at Tuesday's close compared with late Monday,
included: 1.9437 West German marks, down from 1.9485; 1.6748 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6805; 1.18025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17955;
6.5675 French francs, down from 6.5780; and 1,395.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,399.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday: 1.9500 West
German marks, up from 1.9395; 1.6790 Swiss francs, up from 1.6760;
6.5835 French francs, up from 6.5535; 2.1905 Dutch guilders, up from
2.1832; and 1.1822 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1775.
   Gold gained in London to a late bid price of $365.75 an ounce, up
from $364.00 bid Monday. In Zurich, gold jumped to $366.25 an ounce
from $363.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.42 to $365.72 an ounce.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $5.242 a troy ounce from $5.195 late
Monday. Silver settled at $5.24 an ounce in London, up from $5.21.

<HEAD>Deteriorated Soybean and Corn Crop Boosts Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade on reports of deteriorating crop
conditions.
   On other markets, copper futures continued to rally, energy
issues were up, precious metals prices climbed, livestock were down
and pork futures prices were mixed.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 5} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.99\ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 6{
cents higher with September at $2.34\ a bushel; oats were 3\ cents
to 4 cents higher with September at $1.39{ a bushel; soybeans were
11 cents to 20 cents higher with August at $6.22{ a bushel.
   Analysts say Monday's crop ratings from the Department of
Agriculture showed a decline in the condition of the soybean crop _
particularly in Iowa and Illinois _ due to a lack of moisture.
   ``There was also a strike overnight in Brazil,'' said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc. in Chicago. ``While it did
not affect Brazilian soybean shipments, the psychology of that
didn't hurt the beans.''
   Soybean prices were also supported by the National Weather
Service's 30-day forecast _ released Monday _ which calls for
below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures.
   Corn futures were boosted by the announcement that Mexico would
be in the market for 400,000 metric tons of corn and rumors that the
Soviet Union also will enter the market.
   Wheat futures were helped by light commercial purchases by
Algeria and carryover from the other pits, Gidel said.
   Copper continued its climb on New York's Commodities Exchange,
amid fears of a shortage in supplies.
   In addition to a strike that has idled Peru's copper mines, the
strike at Canada's Highland Valley copper mine in British Columbia
continues, as does the shutdown of mines in Bougainville, Papua New
Guinea, due to landowner terrorism.
   ``There is some speculative buying as the demand numbers out of
Japan and the United States are strong,'' said Fred Demler, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Rumors of a strike in Mexico also boosted copper prices.
   Copper was 1.25 cents to 1.50 cents higher with August at $1.218
a pound.
   Bargain hunting pushed precious metals futures up on the Comex,
Demler said.
   The climb in prices were due to a weaker dollar resulting from
intervention by the central banks of several major industrial
nations.
   Gold was $3.60 to $4.30 higher with August at $370.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 4.7 cents to 5 cents higher with August at $5.242
a troy ounce.
   Energy futures were up in lifeless trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The market is looking for something to shake it out of its
lethargy,'' said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D. &amp; F. Man
International Futures Inc. in New York. ``It doesn't appear as
though there is anything on the horizon that will do that.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 10 cents higher
with September at $18.68 a barrel; heating oil was .02 cent to .24
cent higher with September at 50.28 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .03 cent lower to .20 cent higher with September at
52.06 a gallon.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were pressured by commercial selling and
anticipation of the Department of Agriculture's cattle-on-feed
report. Analysts say the report, due out Thursday, is expected to
show lighter placements in feed and heavier marketings than last
year.
   Pork futures were pressured by increased hog receipts and falling
cash prices.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .45 cent lower with August at 74.07
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .90 cent lower with
August at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .35 cent
lower with August at 46.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.28 cent lower to .12 cent higher with August at 24.87 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Chrysler Tentatively Plans 5 Percent Average Price Hike For 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. tentatively plans to boost prices
of its 1990 model cars by an average 5 percent, the automaker said
Tuesday, and blames much of the rise on the cost of
federally-mandated passenger restraints such as air bags.
   Price hikes outlined by the nation's third-largest automaker
would boost the price of a Chrysler LeBaron coupe by 8.7 percent to
$12,495 and of a subcompact Plymouth Horizon by 6.07 percent to
$6,995, for example.
   The federal government is requiring that all cars made in the
United States after Sept. 1 have driver-side air bags or automatic
seat belts as standard equipment.
   Chrysler and Ford Motor Co. said they will install air bags on
about 1 million cars each during the 1990 model year and General
Motors Corp. said it will have the devices on about half as many.
   Earlier this week, GM announced a tentative 3.4 percent increase
in its 1990 car prices, nearly 1 percent of it blamed on air bags.
Ford Division General Manager Thomas Wagner said earlier this month
that his company will boost car prices about 4.8 percent.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said Tuesday that air bags
will add about $450 to the price of each U.S.-made Chrysler car,
although that's less than the automaker actually is spending on
buying and installing the devices. She declined to say exactly how
much the company is spending on air bags.
   The rest of Chrysler's price increase stems from economic
reasons, including higher material and labor costs, she said.
   Those figures are a bit lower than some analysts expected and may
not include much padding for buyer incentives that can be factored
into any car-buying deal.
   There has been speculation that the Big Three are eager to get
out of the incentive war they have been in since early April.
Incentives have cost the companies hundreds of dollars per car in
recent months, cutting directly into profits.
   But a unilateral withdrawal from the rebate war may be tough, and
consumers have grown accustomed to dealer offers of rebates and
cut-rate financing.
   ``They're filing for pretty big price increases,'' said analyst
David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``But whether they will
be real world or just on paper to be superseded with rebates is a
good question.''
   Healy said he may have the answer: ``I think they will wait for
about 15 minutes, see that (1990) sales are slow and come out with
rebates.''
   Firm retail prices will be announced during the next few weeks as
the automakers introduce their 1990 cars.
   Although it is nearly certain that most 1990 cars will be more
expensive than 1989s, some analysts say the sticker shock could be
worse.
   ``If you look at an air bag cost and assume it's between $350 and
$500,'' said analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New
York City, ``the price increases would not appear to be recovering
the total costs of air bags and materials.''

<HEAD>Wussler Resigns From TBS After 10 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert J. Wussler announced Tuesday he was
resigning from Turner Broadcasting System Inc., ending a 10-year
relationship in which the senior executive helped guide the
international expansion of cable television concern.
   Wussler will become president and chief executive officer of
COMSAT Video Enterprises, a Washington-based satellite technology
company. His departure set off a reorganization at the TBS executive
suites.
   TBS Chairman Ted Turner issued a brief statement: ``It is with
regret that I have accepted the resignation of TBS Senior Executive
Vice President Robert Wussler. Bob has been an integral part of the
growth and success of our company over the past decade.''
   Wussler's duties at TBS will be split among several people.
   Advertising, public relations and research will report to Gerry
Hogan, president of Turner Entertainment Networks; the Braves, the
Hawks and Turner Sports will report to Terry McGuirk, president of
Turner Cable Network Sales; and the Goodwill Games, for which
Wussler negotiated with the Soviet Union in 1986, will report to
Paul Beckham, TBS senior vice president for finance and
administration.
   Wussler joined TBS in 1980 after a 21-year career at CBS Inc. and
sits on Turner's board of directors. At TBS, he was responsible for
overseeing the company's ongoing international expansion and its
sports operations, which include the Atlanta Braves baseball team
and the Atlanta Hawks basketball team.
   Wussler also was in charge of all TBS sports and non-fiction
programming.
   His resignation comes at a time when the company is riding high,
having just reported its first quarterly profit in three years. The
Cable News Network has recently signed an agreement to use a Soviet
satellite, allowing its signal to virtually cover the world.
   The 1980s have seen TBS grow from a station known mostly for its
programming of reruns and Braves games to a media power that
includes CNN, Headline News, the new TNT network and the MGM film
library.
   Wussler said in a telephone interview Tuesday that TBS has great
potential for more growth.
   ``I leave with great sadness. I've seen TBS grow from a couple of
hundred people to 4,500 (employees),'' he said. ``TBS is a wonderful
corporation. There's no upper limit here.''
   But he said he was ready for new challenges.
   COMSAT, he said, ``asked me to come in and explore what expansion
in software there can be in the '90s. There's going to be dramatic
changes in how we watch television and purchase equipment.''
   Wussler's interest in satellite technology dates back to the
early 1960s, when he was involved in the expansion of satellite and
minicam usage at CBS.
   Wussler said he would begin the new job in early September, and
that it would probably take until then to wrap his business up at
TBS.

<HEAD>Car, Truck Sales Up 8.2 Percent In Early August</HEAD>

   Sales of cars and light trucks rose 8.2 percent in
early August compared with last year, partly because of buying by
consumers seeking to avoid price increases for 1990 cars, the
companies reported Tuesday.
   Vehicles assembled by the eight major automakers in the United
States sold at an average daily rate of 33,660 during the Aug. 1-10
period this year, compared with a rate of 31,118 during the same
time last year.
   Car sales rose 7.4 percent and truck sales were up 9.4 percent
from the year-earlier period.
   In the last two seeks, the Big Three automakers have outlined
tentative price hikes for cars in the model year that generally
begins in October. General Motors Corp. said its tentative prices
will be about 3.4 percent above 1989 levels, Ford Motor Co. said its
prices will be about 4.8 percent higher and Chrysler Corp.'s 1990
prices will be about 5 percent up from 1989.
   The companies said some of the increases are due to costs
stemming from governmental requirements that they install passive
restraint systems _ air bags or automatic seat belts _ in 1990 model
cars.
   Some consumers may be pushing their 1990 car buying plans up a
few months to miss the price boosts.
   ``I think in all probability there are people buying a little
earlier than usual, but not many,'' said analyst Ron Glantz of
Montgomery Securities Inc. of San Francisco.
   He said the picture would become a clearer later in the month as
more sales reports are issued.
   Consumers also were lured by incentives, which automakers would
like to drop during the coming model year.
   ``Car sales are a little stronger than I expected,'' said analyst
David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York. ``I would
say it is the attractive rebates on the '89s and the fear of costs
of air bags.''
   For Jan. 1 through Aug. 10, car and truck sales were 3.6 percent
behind last year's pace, falling to an average daily rate of 38,063
this year from a rate of 39,500 last year. Car sales were off 4.8
percent and truck sales were down 1.5 percent during the period.
   GM car sales during the 10-day August period dropped 2.7 percent
to a daily rate of 9,368 this year from 9,631 a year earlier. GM's
sales for the year to date were 8.6 percent behind last year's pace.
   GM's truck sales in early August were up 9.2 percent and for the
year to date were 2.2 percent behind last year's pace.
   Ford's early August car sales rose to a rate of 6,826 a day, 17.6
percent up from a rate of 5,804 in the year-earlier period. For the
year-to-date period, Ford's car sales were down 1.6 percent.
   Ford truck sales in early August were up 5.1 percent over last
year. For the year through Aug. 10, Ford's truck sales were down 2.8
percent from last year's pace.
   Chrysler's early August car sales rose 5.6 percent to a daily
rate of 2,835 this year from 2,685 daily a year earlier. Chrysler's
car sales for the year to date were 14.1 percent behind last year's
pace.
   Truck sales were up 16.8 percent in early August for Chrysler,
while falling 0.2 percent from a year earlier for the Jan. 1-Aug. 10
period.

<HEAD>Sandinista Government Seeks Foreign Investments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government said Tuesday
it is embarking on a program to attract foreign investments now that
an agreement has been reached to disband the U.S.-backed rebels.
   In an interview with the Sandinista party newspaper Barricada,
Jesus Castillo, director of foreign investment, said the government
had begun a publicity campaign designed ``to be an aggressive policy
to attract foreign capital.''
   He said companies in other Latin American countries, the United
States and various European countries had expressed interest.
   Castillo said the campaign would emphasize the foreign-investment
law enacted in November 1987, which allows total or partial
repatriation of profits to other countries, depending on the
industry.
   Foreign capital also can form joint ventures with Nicaragua's
public or private sectors. The leftist government seeks foreign
capital in several areas, particularly agriculture.
   Castillo said 36 foreign companies operate in Nicaragua, among
them Esso, Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsico Inc. Esso, whose parent company
is Exxon Corp., operates the country's only oil refinery.
   A U.S. economic embargo virtually ended the flow of investment
capital from the United States and, with the rebel warfare, helped
create hyperinflation and severe unemployment.
   Inflation was estimated at 20,000 percent last year, but by July
the rate had slowed to 8.5 percent a month. Official figures put the
unemployment rate at 25 percent of the 1 million-member labor force.
   On Aug. 7, President Daniel Ortega and four other Central
American presidents agreed that the rebels, known as Contras, should
be disbanded.
   President Jose Azcona of Honduras said Monday he was convinced
Nicaragua had established democratic conditions that would allow the
Contras to return to their homeland. Most of the Contras are in
bases in Honduras.

   The stock market finished slightly higher Tuesday
after struggling through a featureless session.
   ``It was a yawning affair,'' said Edward P. Nicoski, a technical
analyst for the Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. investment firm.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.86 points to close
at 2,687.78. The Dow Jones average had declined a total of 34.71
points in the previous two sessions, retreating from near-record
highs.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
809 issues up, 689 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 148.77 million
shares, up from 142.01 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.425 million shares.
   The market zigzagged through most of the session. Analysts said
there was some profit-taking but overall little selling pressure as
many participants withdrew from the market to await more information
on the economy.
   ``The market is looking for new impetus,'' said Eugene Peroni,
technical analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
``The market vacillations seem to suggest that traders are looking
for a new comfort level at which to buy.''
   Blue-chip stocks came alive in afternoon trading, pushed higher
by computerized trading strategies.
   Economy sensitive and industrial stocks posted gains, reflecting
what some strategists called an improved outlook.
   ``People feel the worst of the industrial downturn is upon us,''
said Michael Metz, equities analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Smith Corona rose \ to
18\, Ford Motor gained ~ to 51 and General Motors advanced 1[ to 45{.
   UAL fell 4\ to 254\, reflecting some emerging doubt about the
chances of a takeover bidding war for the airline company. USX also
fell ] to 34~ and Philip Morris lost 1| to 157|.

   Oil futures prices finished mostly higher Tuesday
in continued dull trading, buoyed mainly by technical market
factors, traders said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September-delivery
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, closed 10 cents higher at $18.68 per 42-gallon barrel.
Contract months for later delivery posted smaller advances.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded regular
gasoline for September delivery slipped 0.3 cent to 52.06 cents a
gallon. Most contracts for later delivery rose, however.
   Heating oil futures, which led the market higher last week,
posted moderate gains. The September contract jumped 0.24 cent to
finish at 50.28 cents a gallon.
   ``It's been very, very quiet in the market,'' said Jerry Samuels,
a vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The market gained some momentum when the September crude contract
hit the $18.50-per-barrel level, but other than that technical
factor there was little to move prices, he said.
   The oil market has been in the summer doldrums for some time.
Traders are looking forward to Labor Day for a pickup in activity
and beyond that to the next scheduled meeting, on Sept. 23, of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

   Armand Hammer, elated over his pardon by
President Bush for a Watergate-era crime, won a 13-year battle to
clear his name with the same persistence and political savvy that
made him a multibillionaire industrialist and intimate of world
leaders.
   Hammer, 91, said on Monday he had been pardoned for making
illegal contributions to President Nixon's re-election campaign in
1972. Hammer had pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976, and was
sentenced to one year's probation and fined $3,000.
   White House officials confirmed that Bush had pardoned Hammer and
nine other unidentified people on Monday, but refused to give
details. Repeated efforts to reach presidential counsel C. Boyden
Gray were unsuccessful Tuesday.
   ``Having spent my lifetime fighting injustice, this vindication
reinforces my abiding faith in the American system of justice,''
Hammer said in a statement from his Los Angeles home. ``I deeply
appreciate President Bush's action in clearing my name.''
   A spokesmen said Tuesday that Hammer, chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., would have no further comment.
   Hammer spent several years seeking a pardon. President Reagan is
known to have considered granting Hammer's wish before he left
office last January, but nothing came of it.
   ``I'm pleading (guilty) because I'm guilty,'' Hammer had declared
in federal court in 1976. But Hammer had blamed former Gov. Tim
Babcock of Montana, a former vice president of an Occidental
subsidiary, through whom the $54,000 in illegal payments were made.
   Hammer argued that he funneled the money through Babcock to
maintain anonymity, but that Babcock did not deliver the funds until
after a new federal law went into effect in April 1972 which
prohibited making campaign contributions in someone else's name.
   Babcock was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $1,000
for concealing the identity of Hammer as the actual donor. A federal
judge later set aside Babcock's prison term, partly because Hammer
was given probation instead of a prison term because of his age and
poor health.
   Leaving his hospital bed as a heart patient for sentencing 13
years ago, Hammer expressed regret over the first crime he had ever
committed. He told the judge that ``I trust, in the time that may be
left me, your honor will allow me to continue being a useful member
of society.''
   Since his brush with the law, Hammer has circled the globe in his
specially outfitted Boeing 727 hobnobbing with presidents, kings and
prime ministers, pushing for U.S.-Soviet summit talks, providing aid
to earthquake victims, giving away chunks of his vast art collection
and trying to raise $1 billion to find a cure for cancer.
   ``I've had two dreams, two ambitions in life, and I hope to
accomplish both of them,'' he once said. They are peace between East
and West and a cure for cancer.
   All the while, Hammer has guided Occidental Petroleum's growth
from a struggling oil company worth $34,000 in 1956, when he made
his first investment, into a colossus of oil, chemicals, coal and
foods with a book value of more than $6 billion.
   His pardon was not universally applauded, however.
   A group called the Friends of Oliver North decried the pardon for
the man they said ``has been trying to encourage communist expansion
through his open business dealings with the Soviet Union.'' The
group called on Bush to ``muster the courage'' to pardon North, the
former White House aide convicted of charges in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Born in New York as the grandson of a Russian Jewish immigrant,
Hammer became a millionaire while still studying at Columbia
University, when he took over his physician father's faltering
pharmaceutical business and turned it into a money-maker.
   At 23, he was fresh out of medical school but unwilling to wait
six months to begin his internship at New York's Bellevue Hospital.
So in 1921, Hammer made his first trip to the Soviet Union to help
alleviate a typhus epidemic.
   Once there, Hammer decided the Russian people needed food more
than medical assistance. He quickly announced a deal that brought a
shipload of surplus American wheat valued at $1 million in return
for Russian furs, hides and caviar.
   That deal caught the attention of V.I. Lenin, the first of many
Soviet leaders Hammer has known. Lenin encouraged the young American
entrepreneur to take over an abandoned asbestos mine near western
Siberia, the first Soviet concession ever granted to a foreigner.
   Hammer developed the mine into a profitable enterprise, and soon
obtained sales concessions for such leading American firms as Ford
Motor Co., U.S. Rubber, Allis-Chalmers and Underwood Typewriter. He
also opened the Soviet Union's first pencil factory, which posted $1
million in profits in the first year.
   Hammer left the Soviet Union in 1930, taking his profits in the
form of paintings, tapestries, silver and jewels, which formed the
start of his multimillion-dollar art collection. He owns two art
galleries in New York City.
   During the 1940s, Hammer netted a $7.5 million profit from a
$100,000 investment by developing a way to turn surplus potato crops
into commercial alcohol and marketing a blended whiskey under his
own label. He accumulated seven distilleries and later sold his
entire whiskey interests to the Schenley group.
   He also made fortunes in livestock feed and cattle, and held the
nation's first million-dollar purebred Angus cattle sale. Even
today, he is reaping fat profits from a $20 billion chemical
fertilizer deal with the Soviets, and has joint coal mining and
phosphoric acid ventures under way in China.
   Commenting on his reputation as a worldwide wheeler-dealer,
Hammer once said: ``I am first a catalyst. I bring people and
situations together. That's the big thing _ bringing the deal
together.''

<TEXT>
   A Boeing Corp. subsidiary overcharged the
government by $5.9 million on five computer projects between 1983
and 1987, a House committee said Tuesday.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee, released a report from the General Accounting
Office, the congressional auditing agency, detailing the overcharges
by Boeing Computer Services Co. Like GAO, Conyers said he was asking
the Air Force to seek recovery of the money.
   Spokesmen for Boeing Computer Services in Seattle had no
immediate comment on the report.
   Conyers also said he received a related but separate report from
the GAO Tuesday suggesting that the Software Productivity
Consortium, a group of 14 of the nation's leading defense firms
established to develop tools and techniques to improve the
productivity of military software, may have overcharged the
government by $22.5 million for their participation in the
consortium.
   In both cases, the House Government Operations Committee said,
the improper charges stemmed from misclassification of projects as
``manufacturing and production engineering,'' a category of expense
for which contractors can be fully reimbursed by the government.
   The GAO, however, concluded that both Boeing Computer Services
and the Software Productivity Consortium should have classified
their activities as ``independent research and development''
expenditures, a classification of expenses for which the government
contribution is limited.
   ``In this era of $300-billion military budgets and
half-billion-dollar airplanes, $6 million may not seem like much,
but that money could give 2,225 youngsters a chance in life by
putting them through one year of Head Start,'' Conyers said in a
statement.

<HEAD>Group Raises Bid for Sea Containers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock price for Sea Containers Ltd. surged
Tuesday after a bidder pursuing the equipment leasing and shipping
concern raised its unsolicited takeover offer by about $200 million
to more than $1 billion.
   The bidder is Temple Holdings Ltd., a company jointly owned by
Stena Holding AG, a Swedish shipping concern, and Tiphook PLC, a
British concern that provides containers to the shipping industry.
   Temple said it was raising its tender offer for Sea Containers'
common stock to $63 a share from $50 a share and boosted its offer
for the company's convertible preferred shares to $101.43 a share
from $80.50 a share.
   The offer values Sea Containers at about $1.02 billion, up from
$824 million under the previous offer was launched May 26.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Sea Containers rose
$4.12{ a share to $67.12{.
   Sea Containers had said last week that it was considering
recapitalizing as an alternative to the original takeover offer.
   The company, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, and its New
York-based public relations firm could not be reached after business
hours for comment on the higher offer.
   The three companies reportedly met Aug. 3 to discuss the
possibility of a sale of certain assets of Sea Containers' ferry
services and container businesses to Stena and Tiphook.
Subsequently, Stena and Tiphook said they may sell all or part of
their 8 percent stake in Sea Containers.
   Temple extended the expiration date of the latest tender offer to
Aug. 28.
   It said that under terms of its original offer, which was to have
expired Monday, approximately 103,500 shares of common stock had
been tendered.

<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diamond-Star Motors Corp. announced Tuesday
it has reached a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers
union on the company's first three-year labor contract.
   Diamond-Star is a joint venture of Chrysler Motors and Mitsubishi
Motors, which are equal partners and have a joint management team at
the $650 million factory built west of town.
   Neither the company nor the union would discuss terms of the
contract, which must be ratified by 2,300 assembly line and
maintenance workers at the year-old factory.
   ``Negotiations concluded today,'' Robin Skiles, Diamond-Star
spokeswoman, said Tuesday. ``The two sides began talking March 29
and negotiations have continued since then.''
   Frank Joyce, UAW spokesman in Detroit, described the talks as
``protracted'' and said they recently intensified.
   Joyce said he expects the proposed contract to be put up for a
ratification vote within a week.
   The company employs about 2,600 people in the assembly of
two-door sports coupes marketed as the Plymouth Laser and the
Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   Diamond-Star also builds high-performance versions of the Laser
and Eclipse, which are four-wheel drive specialty coupes to be
distributed as the Eagle Talon and Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX.
   Plans call for the company to build a four-door sedan, called the
Eagle Summit and Mitsubishi Mirage, later this fall.
   Production at the plant began last September and workers voted to
join the UAW in December.

<HEAD>Canadians Say They Will Raise Bid for Dunkin' Donuts If They Win
Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Canadian partnership removed some conditions
Tuesday on its $296 million hostile bid for Dunkin' Donuts and said
it would raise the offer to $308 million if it wins a lawsuit
challenging the doughnut shop chain's anti-takeover measures.
   DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Kingsbridge Capital Group
and Cara Operations Ltd., said it would raise its price to $45 a
share, from $43, if Delaware's Chancery Court orders Dunkin' Donuts
to rescind its employee stock ownership plan and other defenses.
   The Toronto-based partnership's offer originally was conditioned
on obtaining 75 percent of the doughnut company's shares. That
offer, which was set to expire at midnight Tuesday, was extended
until Sept. 15 and is now conditioned on obtaining just 50.1
percent, or a bare majority, of the shares.
   ``What we are saying by dropping the minimum number of shares is
that we're prepared to buy a voting control position and hang around
until we get actual control, which could take a couple of years,''
said Eric W. Evans, a spokesman for Kingsbridge.
   Dunkin' Donuts, which is based in suburban Randolph, had no
immediate response to the revised offer. The reaction on Wall Street
was lukewarm; Dunkin' Donuts shares rose 37{ cents to close at
$37.87{ in over-the-counter trading Tuesday.
   Kingsbridge, the merchant banking arm of investor George Mann's
Unicorp Canada Corp., offered a friendly merger with Dunkin' Donuts
at $42 a share in May. When it was rebuffed, it joined with Cara,
the parent company of two Canadian restaurant chains, to launch the
$43-a-share hostile offer.
   Dunkin' Donuts has set up a series of tough defenses, including
the employee stock ownership plan, which holds about 16 percent of
its outstanding common shares.
   It also has a shareholder rights plan, or ``poison pill,''
designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a
takeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive.
   And it has sold $28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an
11 percent stake in the company, to an avowedly friendly investor,
General Electric Capital Corp.
   Kingsbridge and Cara have filed suit in Delaware charging that
the ESOP and preferred stock sale were improperly put in place
solely to prevent a takeover. The Canadian partners also have asked
the Chancery Court to order Dunkin' Donuts to remove its poison pill.
   Last week, the court refused to grant the partnership a
preliminary injunction against the takeover defenses. The case has
not yet been scheduled to be heard on its merits.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced new rules
allowing foreign investment in the nationalized petroleum industry,
hoping to attract $8 billion over the next five years and modernize
the industry.
   ``This is the first time we have defined clearly what foreign
investment is allowed in petrochemical products,'' Alfredo Elias,
spokesman for the Mexican Petrochemical Commission, said at a news
conference Tuesday.
   The commission has ruled that 15 oil-based products are now open
to 40 percent private investment by foreign and domestic interests,
Elias said. Those products were formerly reserved exclusively for
the national oil company Petroleos de Mexico, also known as Pemex.
   The new rules also allow about 350 tertiary petrochemical
products to be manufactured with 100 percent private investment.
These include about 100 plastics products.
   Loosening Pemex's grip on petroleum by-products follows a May
announcement that the government was allowing greater foreign
ownership in Mexican companies.
   President Carlos Salinas Gortari's administration has been
striving to increase foreign investment and make the notoriously
ineffectual oil industry more efficient and less corrupt.
   ``It's important for Mexico to be integrated in world commerce
and that we modernize technology,'' Elias said.
   The Mexican Constitution reserves primary petrochemical product
manufacture to the government; only secondary and tertiary products
come under the new ruling.
   The Energy, Mines and Parastate Companies Department projects
Pemex investments of $1.5 billion through 1995. The government
expects to attract an additional $8 billion from foreign and
domestic private investors, Elias said.
   Foreign companies that have shown an interest in investing
include Du Pont, Union Carbide Corp., Hoechst Celanese Corp. and
Shell Oil Co., he added.
   The government hopes to increase petrochemical exports and
decrease imports under the new scheme, he said.
   Investment of 40 percent will be allowed in producing vinyl
acetate, acetone, acrylic acid, anhydrous acid, chlorobenzenes,
ammonium phosphate, isoprene, isopropanal, ammonium nitrate,
ammonium sulfate, polypropylenes and urea. These are all secondary
products.
   Pemex will maintain exclusive control over 20 primary
petrochemical products derived from the first refinement of crude
oil. They include benzene, ethanol, methanol, propylene, N-paraffins
and toluene.

   The Chicago Board of Trade, at the center of a

practices, on Tuesday created a permanent panel to monitor the

   The Committee on Ethics and Integrity will examine all aspects of
exchange trading practices ``to ensure the utmost of integrity and
ethical conduct,'' the Board of Trade said in a statement.
   It said the committee was created by the unanimous vote of the
exchange's board of directors.
   In addition to creating the committee, the board also added its
fourth director who is not a member of the exchange. This will bring
the board's membership to 25.
   ``Integrity is the No. 1 priority of this exchange,'' said CBOT
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann. ``We feel that the addition of another
non-member director and the establishment of the Committee on Ethics

   The striking Communications Workers of America and NYNEX Corp.
announced plans for their first contract talks since the walkout
began as strikers mourned the death Tuesday of a telephone worker
injured on the picket line.
   But spokesmen for unions striking another of the four so-called
``Baby Bell'' companies, Bell Atlantic Corp., said bargaining was
going slowly.
   ``I believe this is going to be a long strike,'' said John
Cremmy, an executive board member of Local 827 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. ``I estimate at least a month,
maybe longer.''
   Nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, technicians and other workers
are on strike against the four regional telephone companies in 20
states and the District of Columbia.
   Only Pacific Bell had official contract talks in progress
Tuesday. Company spokeswoman Lynn Jimenez refused to disclose any
details of the negotiations. No other talks were announced.
   Most customers have noticed the strike only through delays in
services such as directory assistance, but strikers said a few
thunderstorms knocking down telephone lines could put the companies
in trouble.
   A Bell Atlantic subsidiary, New Jersey Bell, reported five cases
of sabotage Tuesday. Lines were cut some time during the morning by
axes and hacksaws, causing about 2,000 customers in four towns to
lose service. Service was expected to be restored by mid-evening,
officials said.
   The companies affected are:
   _New York-based NYNEX, which serves about 50 percent of New York
state, a small part of Connecticut and the five other New England
states. Its companies have 60,000 workers on strike. Some 10.3
million customers are affected.
   _Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which has subsidiaries serving
12.7 million customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland,
Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. It
has 52,000 workers on strike.
   _San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, whose two
subsidiaries serve 13.2 million customers in parts of California and
all of Nevada. More than 40,000 CWA members are striking.
   _Chicago-based Ameritech, which owns companies serving 12 million
customers in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan. It has
35,000 employees belonging to the CWA on strike. An additional
12,500 employees, members of the IBEW, have ratified agreements with
the companies.
   NYNEX and the CWA announced informal contract talks for Wednesday
after company president Fred Salerno appealed for calm.
   Salerno's appeal came one day after cable splicer Edward G.
Horgan, 34, was fatally injured when he mounted the hood of a car
driven by a non-striking telephone employee on the service road of a
NYNEX facility in the New York City suburb of Mount Pleasant.
   Horgan pounded on the windshield, but slid off and hit his head
on the pavement, police said. The union disputed that, saying he
fell onto the hood and the 18-year-old driver accelerated. No
charges were filed.
   Horgan died of head injuries at 1:15 p.m. Tuesday, said union
spokeswoman Clara Allen.
   Salerno said he had called CWA Vice President Jan Pierce with his
concerns, ``and he and I agreed the best way of approaching it is to
try and calm the waters and try and find a way back to the
negotiating table.''
   In Philadelphia, however, a CWA spokesman said the telephone
company was negotiating at a snail's pace.
   ``Yesterday, the company got back to our proposal of four days
ago,'' union spokesman Bob Schlacter said Tuesday.
   ``They offered shallow changes,'' Schlacter said. ``Our union was
all over them because they took four days to make these small
changes. We are still far apart on major issues.''
   Informal negotiations between the CWA and Bell Atlantic occurred
in Washington on Tuesday and further talks are expected Wednesday,
company spokesman Larry Plumb said.
   Ken Pitt, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, said the company was waiting
for the CWA to respond to its latest offer.
   Three other companies have reached settlements with the CWA and
the IBEW. They are Atlanta-based Bell South, Denver-based US West
and St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell.
   In West Virginia, meanwhile, the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone
Co. said it was repairing damage by vandals that had left 8,000
customers without operator service or an emergency 911 connection in
Putnam and Kanawha counties.
   Also, two union members striking the New York Telephone Co. were
charged with harassment in Erie County after a company manager
complained they followed his service truck to a job and screamed
insults at him.
   In Newark, N.J., more than 700 striking telephone workers staged
a noisy rally outside New Jersey Bell's state headquarters Tuesday
to protest the benefits package offered by the company.
   ``This strike is not against the people of New Jersey but against
the company that refuses to give benefits,'' said Terry Caggiano, an
information operator in Newark.

the Singapore and Sydney foreign exchange markets.
   Minoru Ozawa, a foreign exchange dealer with the Taiyo Kobe Bank,
said dealers were positioning themselves before announcements later
Wednesday of U.S. housing starts and investment utilization rates
for July.
   ``There were no other reasons to sell,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities said

   He said that stock traders also were waiting for the U.S. figures
from Washington, but were optimistic.
   Blue chips as well as laggard issues attracted buyer attention,
