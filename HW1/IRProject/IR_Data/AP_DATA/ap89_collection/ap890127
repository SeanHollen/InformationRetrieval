   Former President Reagan, before he left office,
told Congress that the United States would be unlikely to certify
this year that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear bomb, The
Washington Post reported.
   The newspaper, in its Saturday editions, said Reagan certified
last November that Pakistan ``does not possess a nuclear explosive
device,'' but attached a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex.,
saying the administration was nearing its limits of being able to
continue making the certification.
   ``The Congress should be aware that as Pakistan's capabilities
grow, and if evidence about its activities continue to accumulate,
this process of annual certification will require the president to
reach judgments about the status of Pakistani nuclear activities
that may be difficult or impossible to make with any degree of
certainty,'' the Post quoted Reagan as saying.
   Without certification, required annually under the law, Pakistan
will not be eligible to receive U.S. economic and military aid
beyond the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   The Reagan administration budget for fiscal year 1990 includes a
request for $621 million in assistance to Pakistan, part of a $4.02
billions, six-year package.
   The Post, quoting unnamed congressional sources, said Reagan
administration officials had told lawmakers privately that Pakistan
was so close to building a bomb that ``it had been a very close
call'' in renewing the certification last November.
   The newspaper said it was not known if President Bush will accept
its predecessor's conclusion about Pakistan's nuclear capabilities,
although Bush is known to be extremely concerned about the problem
of nuclear weapons proliferation.
   In his letter to Wright, the Post said, Reagan said he had made
his ``best judgment'' on the basis of available information to the
U.S. government, based on the standard set by Congress regarding the
Pakistani nuclear program.
   The standard, he said, ``is whether Pakistan possesses a nuclear
explosive device, not whether Pakistan is attempting to develop or
has developed various relevant capacities.''
   Reagan said in the letter that the United States remained
``extremely troubled'' by the continuing risk of a nuclear arms race
between Pakistan and India, the Post said.

   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen ended
an unprecedented visit to Thailand on Friday, declaring ``the
killings must stop'' in his country.
   Hun Sen's visit to Thailand, which previously shunned his
Vietnamese-backed government and supports the guerrilla coalition
fighting it, is considered an important move to end the conflict.
   ``We are starting to build a foundation,'' said Thai foreign
policy adviser Kraisak Chunhavan.
   Hun Sen said his trip was successful, but he brushed aside
reports that the visit at Bangkok's invitation implies recognition
of his government by Thailand.
   ``The question of recognition or non-recognition does not matter.
The question is to stop the killing as soon as possible,'' he said.
   The unexpected talks reflects Thailand's worry that other parties
that might not represent its interests are taking major initiatives
on the Cambodian issue.
   In the past, Bangkok derided Cambodia's leaders as puppets of the
Vietnamese.
   In New Delhi, India, meanwhile, Vietnam's foreign minister Friday
said Cambodian peace talks in Indonesia would be held as scheduled
despite Prince Norodom Sihanouk's statement that he will not attend.
   Nguyen Co Thatch compared the peace talks beginning Feb. 19 with
the final 15 minutes of a soccer match where everyone is ``trying to
score a point. If anyone misses the match, it is his
responsibility.''
   ``The match will continue, I only hope Prince Sihanouk will
change his stand,'' Thach told a news conference.
   Sihanouk said he will not come to the talks because Hun Sen has
rejected his five-point Cambodian peace plan.
   ``The role of Prince Sihanouk is very important, but he cannot
decide everything,'' Thach said.
   Thach was in India along with Nguyen Van Linh, secretary-general
of Vietnam's Communist Party, who was the chief guest at India's
republic day celebrations on Thursday.
   Vietnamese troops invaded Camdobia in late 1978 and installed a
pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh. Vietnam says it will pull out
completely from Cambodia by the end of 1990 or perhaps sooner if a
political solution is reached.
   The Vietnamese are fighting a coalition of three major Cambodian
resistance groups: the communist Khmer Rouge, the non-communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front of former Cambodian Prime
Minister Son Sann and followers of Sihanouk.
   The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1978 to drive the Khmer Rouge
from power. From the 1975 takeover of the Khmer Rouge to its ouster,
an estimated 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people died from
Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.

<HEAD>At Least 9,500 Gallons Of Radioactive Nuclear Wastes Leaked In 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 9,500 gallons of highly
radioactive nuclear waste leaked from aging storage tanks on the
Hanford nuclear reservation in 1988, according to Department of
Energy documents.
   Seven of the 149 aging, single-walled storage tanks on the Energy
department's plutonium production site were suspected of leaking
last year, the documents said.
   More than 500,000 gallons have spilled into soil around the 1
million gallon-capacity tanks since the late 1970s, but the Energy
Department contends the wastes do not enter groundwater, posing no
environmental or health risks.
   ``It's a drop in the bucket when you consider ... leaks of
500,000 gallons,'' said Jim Thomas of the Spokane-based Hanford
Education Action League, on Thursday. ``But environmental
contamination is still happening.''
   The wastes are byproducts of more than 40 years of plutonium
production for nuclear weapons at the south-central Washington site
generally considered the most contaminated of the DOE's production
sites.
   Estimates for cleaning up the site run to $57 billion over the
next 50 years.
   Bill Klink, a spokesman for Westinghouse Hanford Co., the
contractor that handles the storage tanks, said there is little that
can be done to prevent the leaks.
   Klink said 115,000 gallons that leaked from a tank in 1973 have
stayed within 165 feet of that tank. The tanks are no longer used,
and liquids from at least 95 of them have been into 28 newer,
double-walled tanks on the site.
   However, a large volume of highly concentrated, non-pumpable but
moist ``salt cake'' remains at the bottom of the tanks. DOE
officials concede they are unsure how to permanently dispose of
those wastes.
   Reports on file at the Energy Department's reading room in
Richland, along with its news eleases, show at least seven suspected
leaks during 1988.
   A May news release said that four tanks previously considered
stabilized showed signs of declining liquid levels, and estimated
about 1,500 gallons had leaked.
   The reports say that in July, the level of liquid wastes two
storage tanks was found to have dropped.
   One leak was estimated at 3,000 gallons, the report said. The
other lost about 5,000 gallons.
   Another tank, also showed a gradual decrease in the waste level
``indicating a possible leak or evaporation of residual liquids,''
according to an October ``unusual occurence'' report.

<HEAD>Toilet Rat Cure: Flush Them Back Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rats are scurrying into residents' toilets
with increased frequency as a major sewer project is completed
around the city, a city official says. His solution: ``Flush them
right back down.''
   Bernie Fritz, animal control supervisor for the city, said
Wednesday the rodent problem has worsened as the new system
gradually eliminated the rats' usual exits from sewers _
street-corner catch basins.
   ``They are seeking food and water,'' Fritz said. ``The toilet has
the biggest opening, so the rodents swim through the water and pop
their heads right up.''
   The elimination of catch basins that trap refuse swept into the
sewers also has hurt efforts to control the rat population. The most
convenient and effective way to kill the rodents has been by putting
poison in the catch basins, Fritz said.
   The rat problem has not reached a crisis stage, he said, but the
increased number of rodents in areas where catch basins have been
eliminated has left public health employees seeking a new way to
control them.
   The sewer project, now in its fourth year, creates separate lines
for sanitary and storm sewers. The sewers had been combined, which
occasionally posed health and environmental problems.
   Fritz told the City Council's Public Works Committee Wednesday
that workers have begun attaching poison to pieces of plywood that
they then hang from manholes into the sanitary sewers that run down
city streets.
   Workers have begun a three-month test to make sure the plan works
and to better judge how much more money it might cost the city,
Fritz said.
   Fritz said residents in the vicinity of sewer separation work can
make sure basement toilet lids are shut and floor drains closed.
   And if they find a rat in the toilet?
   ``The best thing to do is shut the lid and flush them right back
down,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ugliest Tie Contest Winners: Wide, Colorful And Repulsive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   What's black and white and red all over, made
from puckered polyester stretch fabric, and covered with starfish?
   The winner of the ``Ugliest Tie in America'' contest, of course.
   This revolting piece of neckwear and 1,400 other contest entries
were on display Thursday evening at the Italian Trade Commission in
New York, which advertised the competition in Esquire magazine as a
way to promote a tasteful alternative _ silk designer ties in
subdued colors, imported from Italy.
   Among the top 10 ugly ties, brightly colored nylon and large
geometric shapes were common. The grand prize-winning black, white
and red number was submitted by 18-year-old Asim Siddique of Dallas,
who said he had a hard time choosing from his father's large
assortment of hideous neckwear.
   ``I thought I had a pretty good shot at winning,'' said Siddique,
a freshman at Collin County Junior College, reached at home by
telephone. ``Once you see the collection, you would think the odds
are on your side.''
   Siddique won 50 Italian designer silk ties as grand prize, and he
plans to stick a few in his dad's closet ``when he's not looking.''
   Each of the 10 runners-up won 25 designer ties.
   One of the runners-up, Geraldine Friedman of Upper Montclair,
N.J., sent in a brown, gold and silver tie bearing a design of
medallions, diamonds and black and white checks.
   She said her husband wore it to their son's bar mitzvah 15 years
ago but ``I doubt he's worn it since. ... My husband has so many of
these ugly ties that you can't believe.''
   Among the other runners-up were a velour tie covered with
multicolored hexagons submitted by Kevin Shippy of Akron, Ohio, and
a green-and-yellow number with large flowers of which the owner,
Colin Mackenzie of Vancouver, Canada, wrote: ``I wore it with a pink
shirt and love beads.''
   The neckwear that didn't win included ties bearing smile faces,
sailboats, American flags, pieces of a patchwork quilt, peace signs,
and even a naked woman.
   Most of the ugly ties were also very wide, five to six inches and
more. The ideal width for a tie these days, according to the
February issue of Gentlemen's Quarterly, is 3{ to 3} inches.
   Italian Trade Commissioner Mario Costagna said that when he saw
the winners, ``I was about to faint.'' He said he doubted there
would be quite so many klunkers were the same contest held in Italy.
   Costagna said Americans bought more than $62 million worth of
Italian ties last year.
   Esquire's editor-in-chief, Lee Eisenberg, said he made sure to
wear a ``perfectly boring'' black-and-white tie to the party
announcing the winners. He blamed the profusion of ugly ties not on
their owners but on gift-givers.
   Looking at the hundreds of fashion disasters on display, he said:
``I find it kind of melancholy. To me it represents 1,200 sad
Father's Day mornings.''

<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army of farm wives, bolstered by the
latest cholesterol concerns, prepares to fan out across the country
to tout the health benefits of U.S. soybean oil.
   Some of the nation's biggest food producers agree to stop using
highly saturated, imported tropical fats like palm and coconut oils
in processed foods, following a bristling private ad campaign.
   Meanwhile, Malaysia, a major palm oil exporter, gears up a public
relations effort to combat what it calls ``vicious scare tactics''
that target its product.
   A vegetable oil war has heated up to full sizzle.
   At stake is the $3 billion-a-year vegetable oil market in the
United States, where the dominant domestic soy oil producers are
squaring off against foreign competitors such as palm oil producers.
   Soy oil accounts for about 72 percent of the 16 billion pounds of
oil sold annually, according to the St. Louis-based American Soybean
Association.
   U.S. Department of Agriculture figures indicate tropical oil
imports have slumped in recent years: Coconut oil imports fell 18
percent, to 450,000 metric tons in 1988 from 548,000 metric tons in
1986, while palm oil imports fell 37 percent to 175,000 metric tons
from 280,000 metric tons in the same period.
   Right now, farmers in the heartland are benefiting from public
concern raised about highly saturated tropical fats. Saturated fats
have been linked to an increase in blood cholesterol that causes
heart disease.
   ``The American consumer will be the big winner with healthy food
products, and the farmers will benefit too,'' said Gunnar Lynum of
the American Soybean Association. ``We represent the good product
and we must promote it.''
   Tropical oil purveyors see it differently. Malaysia has hired the
New York-based public relations firm Hill and Knowlton Inc., which
plans a news conference in March to present scientific claims that
palm oil is a balanced fat that reduces cholesterol and has other
nutritional values.
   Some 1,500 farm wives, in turn, plan their own public relations
blitz with visits in the coming weeks to newspapers, radio stations
and local groups to tout soy oil. They'll carry boxes filled with
commercial cookies, crackers and cereal that no longer contain
tropical oils.
   The American Soybean Association, which is funded by roughly
400,000 soybean growers, plans to introduce a ``soymark'' to
identify products made with soy oil and has spent $400,000 for
promotions over two years.
   One of the more visible assaults in the oil wars has been a
blistering ad campaign by Omaha, Neb., businessman Phil Sokolof, who
spent $2 million to establish his private National Heart Savers
Association.
   One of his ads showed a coconut ``bomb'' and cautioned consumers
that their health was threatened by coconut and palm oils. It listed
popular foods containing tropical oils under the caption ``The
Poisoning of America.''
   So far, a number of giant food processors _ including General
Mills Inc., Pillsbury Co., Quaker Oats Co., Kellogg Co. and Keebler
_ have announced they will drop tropical oils in favor of other
vegetable fats in formulas for certain cookies, crackers, and
cereals.
   Tropical oil producers claim the switching doesn't mean the
battle is lost. Rick McElheny, senior vice president of Hill and
Knowlton, said the companies made a pragmatic business decision to
switch from tropical oils, but predicted they would reverse
themselves.
   ``Because of all this furor and the vicious scare tactics, they
don't want to fight that battle,'' said McElheny. ``They'll let us
do the education, then come back into the market at another time.''
   Some researchers also say the issue is not as simple as the
anti-tropical oil ads suggest.
   They say a small percentage of saturated fat in the American diet
comes from tropical oils _ most is from meat and dairy products.
They also say some recipes require soybean oil to be hydrogenated
and that increases the level of saturated fat.
   To lower the risk of heart disease, they advocate a balance of
saturated and unsaturated fats in the diet, along with exercise and
a reduction in total fat consumption.
   ``A lot of this is industrial hype _ they are worried about the
competition for the oil market,'' said Patricia Johnston, a food
chemist at the University of Illinois. ``I don't think eating a few
cookies with soybean oil is going to make that much difference.''

   Hospital officials say a janitor should have
known better than to take a vacuum cleaner into a room where even
jewelry and credit cards are prohibited because of a powerful magnet
inside a diagnostic machine.
   The janitor, whom Allegheny General Hospital officials declined
to identify Thursday, was struck Monday by the vacuum as it was
whisked several feet toward the Magnetic Resonance Imaging unit,
which uses a magnetic field to record images from inside the body.
   The janitor, part of a crew stripping wax from the floor, escaped
with bruises and a cut.
   ``We take great pains to tell and show our housekeeping staff
what they should and should not take in there,'' said Shawn Haag,
the hospital's vice president of operations.
   Employees are told to remove any metal, including jewelry, before
entering the room. They are warned that even information coded into
the black magnetic strip on the back of credit cards can be
scrambled by the magnet, which is 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet.
   The MRI unit ``has a few scratches, but we expect it has only
minor damage,'' Haag said.

<TEXT>
   The debate over the use of tropical oils in foods centers on the
role fat plays in the diet. Research shows that eating a diet high
in fat, particularly saturated fats, causes elevated blood
cholesterol levels in many people. High cholesterol levels increase
the risk of heart disease.
   Despite the war of words between producers of the various oils,
nutritionists say one can still be at risk if the total percentage
of fat consumed, whether so-called ``good'' fat or not, is too high.
   Here is a brief explanation of fats:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FAT BASICS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   All dietary fats are mixtures of three kinds of fatty acids:
saturated, mono-saturated, and polyunsaturated.
   According to some studies, the relative health merits of
different oils and fats are determined by the proportions of each of
the three different kinds of fatty acids in the individual oil or
fat.
   However, all fats, no matter what the proportion of the three
fatty acids they contain, provide the same number of calories, 9 per
gram.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SATURATED FATTY ACIDS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Fats with a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids are
generally solid at room temperature. Research indicates they
increase blood cholesterol.
   ANIMAL FATS have a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids
than most fats from plants. Animal fats also contain cholesterol.
Examples of animal fat are: chicken fat, lard, precreamed or animal
fat shortening, beef fat, and butter.
   TROPICAL OILS are derived from plants, and therefore contain no
cholesterol. However, they are high in saturated fatty acids. Some
tropical oils actually have more saturated fatty acids than the
animal fats. Examples of tropical oils are: palm oil, coconut oil,
and palm kernel oil.
   HYDROGENATED FATS are other fats of plant origin that have been
processed, or hydrogenated, and have become saturated fats. The
degree of saturation is dependent on the processing, but generally
the harder the product is at room temperature, the more saturated it
is. Examples of hydrogenated products are: hard shortenings, hard or
stick margarines, and some kinds of peanut butter.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MONO-SATURATED FATTY ACIDS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Fats with a high proportion of monosaturated fatty acids do not
increase blood cholesterol. Studies suggest the monosaturates,
particularly olive oil, actually reduce levels of cholesterol in the
blood. Examples of monosaturated fats are: olive oil, peanut oil and
avocado oil.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Fats with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids are
found primarily in plants and in some kinds of fish. Polyunsaturates
reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels in
the blood. Examples of polyunsaturates are: sunflower oil, corn oil,
soybean oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil and some fish oils.

<HEAD>Chinese Artists Reunite 10 Years After Unprecedented Exhibit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade after their avant-garde exhibition in a
Beijing park shook up the moribund Chinese art world, a group of
pioneering artists has reunited in this British colony for their
first retrospective.
   The youthful Chinese artists, known as ``The Stars,'' shot to
prominence in 1979 when they marched through Beijing to protest
police interference in a show they had set up without official
approval.
   The authorities gave in and allowed the artists to stage the
exhibition, unprecedented in Communist China, that featured
once-forbidden topics such as nudes, abstracts and works of
aesthetic rather than political content.
   After another show in 1980, however, the 30-member group
disbanded. While some remained active in Beijing, others scattered
around the globe, settling in Europe, Japan and the United States.
   Six of the artists were recently in Hong Kong for a retrospective
featuring the work of 12 group members. The exhibition opened
earlier this month in the basement gallery of a posh residential
neighborhood and is scheduled to run for five weeks before moving to
Taipei, Taiwan and Paris.
   Sculptor Wang Keping said The Stars were significant by showing
that artistic activity in China need not be organized or approved by
the ruling party. ``Earlier art was all the same,'' he said.
   Individuality was the driving force behind the group, agrees
Chang Tsong-zung, the owner of Hanart Gallery who organized the
retrospective. ``The only common aim of the artists when they first
started was that they wanted to be different from each other.''
   Bo Yun, a teacher at the Academy of Arts and Design in Beijing
whose abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective, said
artistic freedom in China has advanced since the group's landmark
1979 exhibition but limitations remain.
   There is no problem, he said, ``if you use a work of art to
satirize an opponent of the government. But if you mock the
government, I'm afraid that will pose a problem.''
   Members of The Stars also say Beijing no longer allows them to
exhibit as a group, thwarting two attempts in 1983 and 1986. The
reason, believes Bo, is that the group's name has become a symbol of
the democracy movement.
   The retrospective includes works that date from the group's
heyday, including Wang's Buddha-like bust of Chairman Mao Tse-tung
signifying the deification of the Communist leader during the
ultraleftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. It is called ``The Idol.''
   Other pieces adopt obviously current themes, including the
mixed-media work ``Safe Sex'' by Ai Weiwei that features a
prophylactic attached to a rain coat. Prices run from hundreds to
thousands of dollars.
   The works are as different as the paths the artists have taken
since they disbanded after their Beijing exhibitions.
   Wang, 39, a soft-spoken man with a wisp of a goatee who joined
the fanatical Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, moved to
Paris in 1984, convinced he could not develop further in China
largely because of political pressure. ``Art freedom is only
possible in a democratic country with human rights,'' he said.
   The sculptor lives and works out of a workshop he rents from the
French government and has been featured at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Paris and the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seoul,
South Korea.
   Wang recently wrote a political play titled, ``The Retrial of Wei
Jingsheng,'' a contemporary of The Stars who led a fledgling
pro-democracy movement in China before being jailed for 15 years in
1979. Wang said the play will be performed in Paris this March.
   Bo, 40, has remained in Beijing although he is considering a move
overseas. He supplements his 150 yuan ($40) a month salary by
selling his paintings to foreigners in China and at overseas
exhibits. He owns a tiny Fiat, a sign of financial well-being in a
country where private cars remain rare.
   Other Stars on display in the retrospective include Huang Rui and
Ma Desheng, the two leaders of the group, and Li Shuang, who was
arrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor re-education
for ``incitement to debauchery.'' When she was arrested, she was
living with a French diplomat but had not yet married him.
   The exhibition includes caligraphy by Zhong Ahcheng, also known
as Ah Cheng, whose fictional work ``The King of Children'' was
translated to film and premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last
year.
   Although The Stars have spread throughout the world they have
stayed in touch with one another. From the heady days of 1979-80 was
forged ``a feeling of brotherhood'' that has not diminished, Bo said.

<TEXT>
   Carlos Saul Menem, a Peronist and
leading candidate for president, drives race cars, flies planes,
smiles easily, wears his hair to his shoulders and likes to be
photographed with showgirls.
   The 53-year-old provincial governor is colorful in a way that
intrigues an electorate weary of the burdens of Argentina's foreign
debt, energy crisis, triple-digit inflation, rising unemployment,
and political and social tensions.
   Union members and the poor are the core of Menem's Peronist Party
constituency. They ignore his gaffes and policy gaps, and remember
his promises of a brighter tomorrow, his visits to their factory or
village, the naturalness with which he slips a gaucho poncho over
his head and sips mate tea and the five years he spent in prison
during the 1976-83 military dictatorship.
   ``It's easy for me to communicate with people,'' Menem said in an
interview at his campaign office. ``I talk with everyone. I feel at
home in the most humble places.''
   Menem's main rival in the elections set for May 14 is Eduardo
Angeloz of the governing Radical Civic Union.
   The Peronist has been the front-runner since his upset nomination
last July, though his lead narrowed from 37 percent to 30 in a
recent nationwide survey by the agency Mora y Araujo, Noguero and
Associates.
   Two other candidates trail by wide margins in that and virtually
every other poll. The number of undecideds remained high at 19
percent.
   Menem and Angeloz, once classmates at the National University of
Cordoba law school in the 1950s, are as different as the
side-by-side provinces they govern.
   Angeloz's Cordoba is a rich, populous, industrial hub of 2.5
million.
   He prides himself on being a good administrator, and supports the
policies of the President Raul Alfonsin, including privatizing
Argentina's costly public services, paying off the foreign debt, and
basing economic growth on increased exports.
   Menem's La Rioja is a poor, sparsely populated province of
200,000 where high technology is needed to coax seedless grapes and
jojoba, whose oils are used in hair preparations, from desert sand
and heat. As many people who can work for the government.
   Menem was born and reared in La Rioja, the second of four sons of
Syrian immigrants who founded a successful vineyard and winery.
   He notes with pride he has been re-elected twice, and does not
dwell on the fact that his deficit-ridden province issues its own
currency that is worthless elsewhere, nor on the national
implications of his solution to economic stagnation: increased
public spending.
   Eager for middle class support to push him past the 50 percent
minimum he needs in the popular vote to win the election outright,
Menem says he will honor the country's foreign debt obligations and
promote political stability, social harmony and economic growth.
   Businessmen and professionals, however, are wary of his plans for
such things as a ``social pact'' between labor, capital and
government. The pact would, he insists, help set budget policy,
resolve wage disputes, establish price levels.
   Many middle-class voters are troubled by the gaps between Menem's
proposed policies and his personal opinions.
   Argentina's nearly $60-billion foreign debt will be honored,
Menem says, although he maintains that repayment is a ``true
immorality,'' given the country's need for investment capital. He
says he will seek to negotiate a five-year moratorium.
   Menem also attracts criticism for random remarks that rarely are
substantiated or followed up. For example, he has said:
   _ The Peronist Party might try to impeach Alfonsin on grounds of
mishandling the economy.
   _ Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, a military rebel leader, is a
``brilliant'' soldier.
   _ Fidel Castro has dramatically improved life in Cuba.
   _ Paraguay's dictator, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, is a ``good
friend'' of Argentina.
   ``What kind of government can we expect from that candidate and
that party?'' asks Congresswoman Maria Christina Guzman. ``The
Argentine people know well enough. There is a great danger that that
government would be, simply, the waiting room to chaos.''
   Angeloz, who also heads the Independent Federal Confederation
ticket on which Ms. Guzman is the vice presidential candidate, calls
Menem's proposals ``demagogic,'' ``magic prescriptions'' and
``simplistic.''
   Yet, Menem's rallies are well attended, his appearances in
mass-market magazines frequent.
   In speeches and interviews, he quotes the Bible, European
statesmen and philosophers _ and his party's revered founder and
namesake, Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, president in 1946-55 and for 10
months ending with his death in 1973.

<HEAD>Furry Jury Sniffs At Soviet Sausage</HEAD>

   Angry meatpackers are suing a newspaper for an
article that said their sausage was so bad that even cats can't
stomach it, but editors said they turned to a furry, four-legged
jury that proved their point.
   ``Twenty-four sausage experts don't eat it at all; five only eat
high quality sausage or out of extreme hunger. Only one, the
2-month-old kitten Mura, you can say actually sits down to the
sausage,'' the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta said in announcing the
feline findings.
   The dispute started with the literary weekly's story on June 15
titled ``The Cat Doesn't Know ... '' and was brought up recently in
the Dzerzhinsky regional people's court.
   In a complaint signed by Yu. M. Luzhkov, chairman of the Moscow
agroindustrial complex, officials demanded a retraction of the
newspaper's report that producers were breaking the law by putting
protein additives in the sausage, known in Russian as ``kolbasa.''
   Because of a shortage of meat in many Soviet stores, finding good
quality sausage has become a fixation for many people. A cartoon in
an October edition of the satire magazine Krokodil showed a line of
shoppers standing outside a theater, not to buy tickets, but to buy
the sausage for sale in the theater's buffet.
   The case also shows that the more aggressive style of reporting
by the Soviet press under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
encouragement of greater openness is likely to get it into
occasional legal trouble. The Tass news agency said this week a
court had dismissed a lawsuit against a film producer by a
biochemical plant near Leningrad that objected to his documentary
about pollution.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta reported about its dispute with the sausage
manufacturers in an article in this week's edition titled, ``May the
Cats Judge Us.'' It gave no indication that the case had gone any
further than the initial complaint.
   It said that using the permission of state quality control
officials to add protein additives, the factories were grinding up
the skin and bones of cattle and throwing them into the sausage.
   Animal blood, protein paste, blood plasma, starch, flour, and
emulsions of protein and fat also were part of the gray,
unappetizing mixtures churned out by the factories, Literaturnaya
Gazeta said.
   ``Blocks of frozen meat weren't unfrozen or washed before being
chopped, and were happily thrown in with knots of wool and even the
trademarks of the factories that produced these blocks. Nails, sand
and glass have fallen into the sausage,'' it said.
   To judge the validity of its first story, the newspaper said it
sought out the Fauna Cat Lovers' Club in the Dzerzhinsky region,
where it is being sued.
   Boris Berenshtein fed some sausage to Kuzya, his 2{-year-old cat,
``but Kuzya didn't find any joy in it. Just the opposite, he gave a
look like a person saying, `What's that for? What did I do that was
so bad, master?' ''
   It said another cat, Gavrila, tests the sausage for the whole
family of Maria Klyueva. If Gavrila eats it, the whole family will.
If she turns up her nose, so does the family.
   In the end, out of 30 cats, only Mura the kitten eats the sausage
regularly, Literaturnaya Gazeta said.
   ``All kitties, like Mura, must loyally love sausage! That's the
way it always has been since man thought up sausage. But why, the
devil take them, won't they eat it?'' the newspaper asked. ``And why
do we continue to eat it?''

<HEAD>Valentino Debuts In French Haute Couture</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French haute couture world rolled out the red
carpet for Valentino, the king of Italian couture who showed a new
spring-summer high fashion collection that was sensuous and pretty.
   Valentino ruffled feathers in Rome when he announced he was
taking his collection to Paris. Then his business manager Giancarlo
Giametti made matters worse by saying that Valentino could no longer
afford to show for ``down-and-out women and second-rate actresses''
in Rome.
   On Thursday, the Italian master closed a week of French shows on
a high note, flattering the female form with generous draping, front
and back.
   Not all the designs were sexy. Some daytime wear was so strict it
made the models look like tea room waitresses or high-class nannies.
Stiff and proper white collars popped out of impeccable navy blue
suits, and for the cocktail hour, they reappeared in black and white
with dainty lace bibs, aprons and cuffs.
   There were lots of fabulous high-waisted pants. Ending above the
ankle and worn with high heels, they were perfect with suit jackets
and belted tunics.
   ``The collection is beautiful, just beautiful,'' Italian actress
Ornella Muti said after the show. ``There's nothing for me for the
day, because I don't dress up. The evening dresses were wonderful.
Especially the long black dresses.''
   Miss Muti said she was sorry Valentino's clothes can't be worn
more often.
   ``In Rome, you just don't have occasions to wear things like
that,'' she said.
   The Golden Thimble award for the season's most beautiful
collection went to Guy Laroche for spring and summer designs that
some fashion insiders say may be his last. Laroche has been ill for
some time, and he looked gaunt at the Wednesday showing of classic
designs in luscious colors.
   The two-time winner of the Golden Thimble, Laroche said
``eccentricity was not the synonym for elegance.''
   The shirtwaist classic was the story at Givenchy on Thursday,
with high fashion clothes modeled to the romantic crooning of Frank
Sinatra and Yves Montand.
   Classic daytime dresses in gabardine, silk shantung and linen,
skimmed the knee, flared in gentle pleats at the hips, belted at the
waist and tied up at the neck in time for a business lunch.
   There were lots of pantsuits for daytime wear. Full-cut to
camouflage the bumps and adorned with flat, horizontal pockets,
trousers ended just above the ankle, giving a nice, balanced line.
   Givenchy's suits in buttery leather melted in the mouth. Striking
in bright blue and juicy red and stunning in black and white, the
classic blazer softened into new shades of honey, cognac and
mustard. Simple cotton tank tops and silk tie blouses were worn
underneath to give that beautiful, pared-down look Givenchy was
looking for.
   Spring was in the air with go-anywhere, broad-shouldered suits in
creamy whites and pastels, often decorated with round gold buttons
and nipped slightly at the waist.
   Cocktail dresses were a little sexier, with belted or draped
waists, side slits and plunging necklines. Again, the shirtwaist
style, but updated with gold metal braiding and appliques outlining
hems and lower sleeves.
   There were plenty of dresses for hot summer nights and the
schoolmarm daytime look loosened up with pretty floral motifs and
geometric patterns in gauze, crepe and chiffon.
   Givenchy excelled at evening wear, serving up a myriad of colors
and styles. There were organza sheaths and chiffon dresses with
embroidery recalling sea grottoes, along with bustiers of pearl and
porcelaine. One mousseline bustier dress looked like an Indian sari.
   Per Spook also showed on Thursday, presenting a collection based
on the comfort and versatility of wide-legged pajama pants that
covered the foot and brushed the floor.
   His models, in tie-up or sling-back flats most of the time, wore
pants under everything from layers of silk jackets to
off-the-shoulder, ruffled shirts.
   Muted greens, sandy beiges, khaki and camel and burnished oranges
dominated Spook's color palette for daytime wear, but they exploded
into shimmering blues, reds, greens and oranges for evening. Silk
crepe jackets and tuniques, topping orange and yellow silk pants,
were embroidered with sequins and tiny mirrors and emblazoned with
dragons.
   Spook also presented an array of skirts, conventional and
wrap-around, with asymetrical hemlines. Most hit the knee but some
dropped to the less seen midcalf.
   Spook's wedding dress in blue, white and red was a salute to this
year's bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution. Inspired
by the low-necked, corseted look popular two centuries ago, the
dress _ in silk taffeta _ was puffed up by tricolor petticoats and
set off with ruffles and a big bustle.

   A new pinball game takes players on a sumptuous
romp through the Playboy mansion, packed with playmates and pleasure
in the hedonistic style that made Hugh Hefner famous.
   ``Ciao, babe. You look beautiful,'' says Hef, the game's amiable
host, whose tape-recorded voice comes over a digital stereo system
on the computerized, bi-level playfield.
   Wolf whistles and sighs are heard as players rack up points on
the state-of-the-art pinball machine, which is being built to
commemorate Playboy magazine's 35th anniversary.
   ``This will be the pinnacle of pinball for the 80's,'' said Joe
Kaminkow, designer of the machine for Data East Pinball Inc. of
suburban Melrose Park.
   ``There are ramp shots that take you through the mansion and its
grotto. There are cooing birds and cooing girls. The mansion's zoo
is in there, too.''
   The backglass, which combines color photography and animation,
features Playboy founder Hefner and his bride-to-be, Kimberley
Conrad, playing host to a party of playmates by the swimming pool
with its cascading waterfall.
   Hefner's voice accompanies players throughout the game, at one
point asking whether anybody wants more champagne.
   ``I've been playing it for nine months,'' Kaminkow said. ``I love
it.''
   The machine, the second marketed by Chicago-based Playboy, will
be officially unveiled May 11 at a party at the mansion in Holmby
Hill, Calif., with Hefner and Ms. Conrad on hand.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Police Chief First in GOP Race for Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY FARAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daryl Gates, a 40-year veteran of the Los
Angeles Police Department and chief of the 7,000-member force since
1978, filed papers Thursday to become the first Republican in the
1990 race for governor.
   Gates, 62, said his announcement was only of the formation of an
exploratory committee, and that he would not be campaigning actively
in the immediate future or stepping down from the chief's post.
   The chief was required by a new state law, Proposition 73 of last
June, to sign a formal ``Statement of Intent'' which declares that
he is seeking funds for use in a campaign for the office of governor.
   He didn't say when he would make a final decision on whether to
launch an active campaign, but he said if he did do so, he would
resign as police chief.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian announced three weeks ago that
he intends to retire from public life when he completes his second
term in 1991, opening the way for a free-for-all for the GOP
nomination in the June 1990 primary.
   U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth,
also are considering the GOP race.
   On the Democratic side, Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a
former Los Angeles district attorney, is the early favorite for the
Democratic nomination in a possible race with former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Controller Gray Davis.
   The muscular, athletic Gates has spent his entire career in the
Los Angeles Police Department, joining the force as a 22-year-old
rookie in 1949 following his graduation from the University of
Southern California.
   He is credited for the inconspicuous security his department
provided during the 1984 Summer Olympics, but was criticized after
remarking that blacks reacted differently than ``normal people'' to
a controversial police chokehold.

   There is no sign of foul play in the
simultaneous deaths of three of four quadruplets on Jan. 13, the
Fulton County medical examiner said Thursday.
   The infants, Kia, Mia and DeAnthony, were found by their mother,
Tonja L. Walker, at about 5 a.m. on Jan. 13. The fourth infant,
DeAndrea, was hospitalized but now is in good health.
   ``I'm not telling you it's a matter of black and white _ it's
not,'' said Dr. Joseph Burton. ``The scales just tip away from the
direction of foul play at this time.''
   Burton said the simultaneous, unexplained deaths may be unique in
forensic science. He said autopsies revealed that two of the three
had respiratory problems that could have contributed to death.
   The cause, he said, will be listed as ``sudden unexplained death
in infancy.'' He said he probably always will have ``haunting
suspicions'' about the case.
   He said autopsies ruled out meningitis, which doctors suspected
at first as the cause of death.
   There were no signs of strangulation or suffocation. ``We tested
for sedatives, tranquilizers, pesticides, arsenic, strychnine,
cocaine, marijuana, the whole shooting match,'' he said. ``We tested
blood, tissues, stomach contents.''
   Neuro-forensic experts reported finding an unusual change in a
brain cell in the base of one infant's brain. The brain stem
controls breathing.
   Investigators initially suspected foul play because of deaths
happened together and because of contradictory statements made by
adults in the house.
   Maj. L. Dwayne Hobbs of the Forest Park Police Department said
the case remains open but inactive.

<HEAD>`60 Minutes' Captures Gold Baton Award For Two Decades Of Reporting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' on Thursday
received the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award
for two decades of reporting that ``changed the nature of television
news,'' the school announced.
   The Gold Baton, the highest honor of the prestigious broadcast
journalism awards, was formally presented at a ceremony hosted by
Charles Kuralt, anchor of CBS-TV's ``Sunday Morning'' program.
   Other network television winners among the 13 news programs to
capture Silver Batons at the 47th annual awards were CBS News for
coverage of the Persian Gulf by Allen Pizzey, NBC News for ``A
Conversation with Mikhail Gorbachev'' and ABC News for ``Nightline:
In The Holy Land,'' the university said in a release.
   The ``60 Minutes'' program was cited by the awards jurors for
doing ``more than just establish the news magazine format for
television.''
   ``In its 20-year existence it has given more time in prime time
to investigative pieces, captivating features, fascinating profiles
and historic interviews than any other program in the history of
television news,'' the release said.
   In major television markets, Silver Baton award winners included
WCVB-TV in Boston for ``We the Jury,'' in which producer-reporter
David Ropeik found a judge, lawyers and a defendant who let him
follow a trial through the eyes and experiences of the sequestered
jurors.
   Other winners were WWOR-TV of Secaucus, N.J., for tough reports
on the health and safety of children in Jersey City schools and
patronage in that city's school administration, and WUSA-TV of
Washington for ``Thurgood Marshall: The Man,'' in which Marshall
speaks bluntly about a variety of subjects.
   In medium television markets, winners were Erin Hayes and WSMV of
Nashville, Tenn., and KING-TV of Seattle for ``Looking for Lincoln.''
   Columbia University said Ms. Hayes ``consistently demonstrates
her ability to tackle stories other journalists shy away from.'' For
example, it said, she pursued subjects such as sewage overflow as a
potentially serious problem and used an unusual style of
understatement in an investigative report on restaurant inspections.
   According to the release, even before the presidential primaries
KING-TV ``recognized the importance of examining the character of
the 13 major candidates and resourcefully formed a team of seven
local stations around the nation to produce revealing portraits of
each candidate.''
   In small television markets, winners were WCAX-TV of Burlington,
Vt., for ``The Politics of Pollution,'' and John Camp and WBRZ of
Baton Rouge, La., for investigative reporting.
   WCAX-TV used ``extremely effective pictures and natural sound''
to describe the impact of acid rain on New England and the economic
impact of cleaning up industrial pollution, Columbia said.
   Camp demonstrated a ``consistently high level of investigative
reporting'' by documenting mismanagement, bribery and patronage in
the practices of Louisiana's Office of Alcohol Beverage Control, and
by exposing how accident victims sometimes collect huge damage
claims because attorneys fail to challenge the claims in court,
Columbia said.
   For independent television production, Public Affairs Television
and Alvin H. Perlmutter Inc. received an award for ``Joseph Campbell
and the Power of Myth, with Bill Moyers,'' six hourlong
conversations with Campbell, a leading scholar and teacher of
mythology, the release said.
   In radio, Nina Totenberg and National Public Radio was honored
for coverage of the Supreme Court nominations.
   The university noted that Ms. Totenberg broke the story of Judge
Douglas Ginsburg's use of marijuana, ``raising issues of changing
social values and credibility with careful perspective under
deadline pressure.''
   The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards were established
in 1942 by the late Jessie Ball duPont in memory of her husband,
Alfred I. duPont.
   Winners were selected from more than 600 submissions made by
radio and television news directors and producers nationwide.

   Cardinal Jozef Glemp told several thousand
mourners at a funeral service for a priest found in his rectory last
weekend that the clergyman had apparently been murdered.
   The body of Rev. Stefan Niedzielak, provost of the Powazki
cemetery, was found Saturday. He was buried at the cemetery
Thursday. Officials say he died of a broken neck, but have yet to
determine the circumstances of his death.
   ``He died a violent death,'' Glemp said Thursday in brief remarks
to the crowd in front of the Charles Borromeo Roman Catholic church
in northwestern Warsaw.
   Poles have been particularly sensitive to the safety of clergymen
since the 1984 murder of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a supporter of
the Solidarity trade union movement who was killed by security
police.
   Niedzielak, 74, maintained a shrine to Poles killed in the Soviet
Union and speakers at the service said he served as a chaplain to
soldiers in the underground Home Army during the World War II.
   Many elderly Poles attended the funeral. Some of the men wore
red-and-white armbands lettered with the initials of the underground
Home Army, which fought against the Germans during the war.
   One woman held up a banner decorated with red-and-white
carnations saying, ``To the chaplain of Independence.''
   Police blocked the road leading to the cemetery and dozens of
passengers in buses patiently waited for the two-hour service to
conclude.
   The Rev. Zdiszlaw Krol, chancellor of the Warsaw Curia, called
Niedzielak a ``great patriot.''
   Other speakers praised Niedzielak's role in preserving the memory
of those Poles who died at the hands of the Russians during World
War II.
   Several speakers referred to the circumstances surrounding the
priest's death.
   Wojciech Ziembinski, a friend of the dead priest, said: ``And
you, Father Stefan, did not fall off any chair.'' Some had suggested
he died in a fall from a chair.
   Krol dismissed robbery as a motive, saying Niedzielak kept no
valuables in his apartment, which was across from the church.
   The government said an investigation is continuing.

<HEAD>Trucking Industry Hopes to Qualify More Trained Drivers</HEAD>

   A truck industry group says it hopes to put
thousands of professionally trained new drivers on the highway under
a new certification program for driver-training schools aimed at
countering an impending shortage of drivers and weeding out the bad
institutions.
   The Professional Truck Driver Institute of Amrica announced
Thursday that it was certifying eight schools with facilities in 14
states to train drivers, and it hopes more schools will qualify.
   Prospective drivers pay up to $4,000 for six- to eight-week
courses that generally include two weeks in the classroom and the
rest of the time driving trucks on special roadways.
   Jim Johnston, an institute board member and president of the
Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association, said the
certification program offers ``a good chance to get rid of some of
the bad apples'' among training schools.
   He said some of the more than 300 driver-training institutions
around the country rip off students and don't prepare them for the
road.
   Schools had to meet 107 standards, ranging from a minimum number
of hours of training to maintenance of up-to-date equipment.
   Institute president Edward E. Kynaston told a news conference
that about 50 schools applied for certification and even those that
got it had to upgrade their programs to qualify.
   The certifications, recommended by a three-member independent
panel that visited the schools, are good for 18 months. The first
graduates from the certified courses would be qualifying in a few
weeks, Kynaston said.
   The newly certified schools can train about 15,000 drivers a
year, he said. More than 300,000 new truck drivers hit the nation's
highways each year, with drivers currently numbering about 3 million.
   The schools are American Truck Driving School of Elm Mott, Texas;
Chicago Truck Driving School; Diesel Driving Academy of Shreveport,
La.; Crete Carrier Corp. of Lincoln, Neb.; United States Truck
Driving School of Wheat Ridge, Colo.; American Transportation
Education Centers of Crystal City, Mo.; Cummins Professional
Training Center of Indianapolis; and Commercial Training Services of
Portland, Ore.
   George Beaulieu, president of the American Truck Driving School,
said his institution trains about 5,000 drivers a year using more
than 200 tractor-trailer trucks on campuses in Texas and Michigan.
   He said more women, government retirees and recent immigrants are
applying to be truck drivers as the industry faces a shortage of
trained drivers.
   Joseph Passananti of the Chicago school, which trains about 750
drivers a year with 10 trucks, said truck drivers ``who used to be
the knights of the road'' have been suffering from a poor image in
recent years.
   But he said better equipment, better pay and better working
conditions, including sometimes telephones in the truck cab, are
making the job more attractive.
   Truck drivers' earnings range from $25,000 and $60,000 a year,
said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the American Trucking
Associations, Inc. He said tougher standards for drivers, increased
shipping demands and slower growth in the 25-35 age group, which is
the most likely group from which drivers come, are causing the
driver shortage.
   The Professional Truck Driver Institute is an organization set up
by the trucking industry in 1985 to promote driver training and
safety.

   Joe Piscopo says he's no star and if he can
convince an appeals court he's just another Joe, it would save him
thousands of dollars in a divorce ruling.
   A lawyer for Piscopo, 37, argued in Bergen County Superior Court
on Wednesday that the comedian-actor of ``Saturday Night Live'' and
beer commerical fame does not have celebrity good will _ the ability
to generate future earnings based on celebrity status.
   The arguments were part of an appeal Piscopo filed on an Aug. 23
divorce ruling by Superior Court Judge Isabel R. Stark that his
celebrity good will is a ``quantifiable asset.''
   Piscopo's lawyer, Francis W. Donahue, said that if Piscopo has
celebrity good will, it's worth about $46,000 to his former wife,
Nancy.
   Donahue also contested the judge's decision to let Piscopo's
ex-wife move to Florida with their 9-year-old son, Joe Jr., and to
make Piscopo pay $40,000 annually in child support.
   Charles Abut, a lawyer for Piscopo's former wife, urged the court
to uphold the original decision. The appeals court decision is
expected within 10 days.

   Patrick Swayze, who played an altruistic hothead
who dances with both heart and pelvis in the movie ``Dirty
Dancing,'' says he wants to be taken seriously as an actor.
   The classically trained dancer told Gentlemen's Quarterly in its
February issue: ``I don't wanna be a sex symbol. I wanna be an
actor.''
   With all the attention Swayze is getting from fans, the
actor-dancer is ``becoming an extroverted recluse,'' the magazine
says.
   ``You wind up trying to create a world for yourself because you
don't have the real one any more. You can't go anywhere. I didn't
realize the extent of the trade-off,'' Swayze said.
   The 36-year-old Swayze says his eyes are too squinty, and that
his smile is too crooked.
   ``I smile off to one side. I got my father's smile. I've been
workin' not to smile like that,'' he said. ``I'm always exercising
the other side of my face when I'm drivin' my car, so I don't get
too lopsided.''
   ``That's the only level of narcissism I allow myself.''

   Pop singer Robert DeBarge has been
sentenced to five years and three months in federal prison for his
role in a drug case in which his brother awaits sentencing.
   DeBarge and his brother, Jonathon, both members of the singing
DeBarge family of Grand Rapids, and two other men were convicted
last October in U.S. District Court of conspiring to distribute 2.2
pounds of cocaine.
   Robert DeBarge, 26, also a former member of the singing group
Switch, was sentenced Thursday by U.S. District Judge Richard
Enslen. He was convicted of all five charges against him, including
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and traveling across state lines to
further the drug deal.
   DeBarge, before he was sentenced, said he only made $250 profit
on the cocaine deal. He was ordered to report to prison Feb. 20.
   Jonathon ``Chico'' DeBarge, 22, will be sentenced Feb. 7 for
conspiring with intent to distribute cocaine and for traveling from
Los Angeles to Michigan to do so.
   The younger DeBarge gained recognition in 1987 with ``Chico,'' a
pop funk album on the Motown label that reached No. 33 on
Billboard's soul chart.
   He was stopped June 28 by federal drug agents during an
inspection of incoming passengers at Detroit's Metropolitan Airport.
Packages of cocaine were found in his carry-on bags.

<HEAD>Report Says Oil Imports to Surge as Prices Stay Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government forecasters say U.S. dependence on
foreign oil is likely to reach historic peaks in the 1990s as
consumption grows and production slides.
   Imports may account for more than half the nation's oil
requirements by 1994, up from 37 percent last year, the Energy
Information Administration said Thursday.
   In a forecast to the year 2000, the agency also said the
projected import surge would not necessarily make the nation more
vulnerable to a supply crisis.
   Oil imports by 1994 may reach 9.9 million barrels a day, or 55
percent of supplies, and by the end of the century the figures could
be 11 million barrels a day, or 59 percent.
   The highest dependence on record was in 1977, when 46 percent of
oil supplies were imported.
   Many oil industry officials, particularly the smaller,
independent producers hurt most by sharp drops in world oil prices
since 1986, have urged the Bush administration to take action to
limit the growth in oil imports. They contend that further harm to
the domestic industry would weaken national security.
   The Energy Information Administration report said that despite
the trend toward rising imports, ``there is no clear and simple
answer'' to whether the nation was becoming more vulnerable to
potential disruptions of world oil supplies.
   It said U.S. energy security was being preserved partly by a more
competitive global energy market and by the growth in national
stockpiles of oil.
   The existence of substantial oil stockpiles in the United States,
Japan, West Germany and other import-dependent nations ``should even
be adequate to discourage some countries from attempting to use such
a disruption to achieve political objectives,'' the report said.
   The report also said:
   _Despite a current surplus of capacity for generating
electricity, there is likely to be a need for ``substantial fresh
construction'' of power plants ``in a relatively short time.''
   _Coal will remain a mainstay of the domestic energy industry,
accounting for 25 percent of the nation's total energy consumption
by the year 2000, up from 23 percent last year.
   _Oil prices will move erratically for several years as OPEC
struggles to restrain its production. Prices are likely to remain
near current levels of about $15 a barrel at least until 1990, then
begin moving gradually higher.
   By 1994 the world oil price is likely to be $18.90 per barrel, in
1988 dollars, rising to $28 by the end of the century. The current
price is about $15 a barrel.
   _Natural gas production will grow at a slower rate than
consumption, forcing the nation to import increasing amounts of gas.
Much of the extra imports will come from Canada.

<HEAD>Coroner Says Officer Killed By Shotgun Blast, Not Gunman's Pistol</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of two policemen killed in a shootout
with a transient who grabbed an officer's pistol was fatally wounded
by a shotgun blast, not the pistol, said a coroner's report that
apparently contradicted the police account.
   The report raised the possibility that the officer was caught in
crossfire during last Friday's shootout in which other police
officers, some armed with shotguns, killed the gunman.
   Thousands of police officers attended a memorial service Thursday
for the two slain officers, Gordon Silva, 39, and Gene Simpson, 45.
Afterward, police spokesman Officer Don Tietgens said Police Chief
Joseph McNamara would have no immediate comment on the coroner's
report.
   ``The chief thinks it is inappropriate to comment because of the
fact that we just buried fellow officers,'' he said. ``Until the
results of lab tests and ballistics tests are turned in and our own
investigations are complete, we will have no comment.''
   Police had reported that Silva and Simpson were both fatally shot
by Dale Randy Connors, who had wrestled away Simpson's .357-caliber
Magnum pistol during a brief struggle near a downtown doughnut shop.
Connors was later identified as a transient and petty criminal who
associated with the homeless.
   Simpson was shot in the head with his service revolver, but
Silva's death certificate conflicts with the initial police version
of how he was killed. Connors only carried the pistol during the
shootout and apparently did not have access to a shotgun.
   Silva's death certificate listed shotgun pellet wounds to the
abdomen as the cause of death, John Manok, chief investigator for
the Santa Clara County Coroner, said Thursday.
   He added that his office has not issued its complete report in
the case. ``We are looking at the middle of next week for that,''
Mank said.
   Two other wounds to Silva's legs were superficial, said Manok,
adding it could not be determined whether the superficial wounds
were from a pistol.
   Part of the shooting was filmed by Santa Clara University
students who were in the area taping a documentary for a class.
   The blurred, jumpy videotape's audio track recorded 26 shots in
3{ minutes, with 21 of those coming during the final 30-second
volley that killed Connors.
   The shooting began with a noontime call of a disturbance at
Winchell's Donut House in downtown San Jose, where Connors was
reportedly threatening people and went into the street to direct
traffic.

<HEAD>Study Questions Greenhouse Warming</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists looking at nearly a century of
records say they can't discern any warming trend to confirm the
threat of a greenhouse-like heating of the earth.
   The heat and drought of last summer helped fuel concern about the
greenhouse theory of climate change, even though scientists
cautioned that one unusual season didn't necessarily prove a
long-term trend.
   Now, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration report that they have been unable to find evidence of
any overall temperature increase for the United States.
   ``The most important result of this study is that there is no
statistically significant evidence of an overall increase in annual
temperature or change in annual precipitation for the contiguous
U.S., 1895-1987,'' concluded the authors of the new analysis.
   Another leading climate expert, however, cautioned that the
findings don't necessarily knock down the greenhouse theory.
   James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New
York said that the new analysis is limited to the United States.
   It's not inconsistent with the greenhouse theory for some parts
of the world to be warmer, others cooler and some to show no change
at this point, he said in a telephone interview. By the mid-1990s,
he went on, the data should show a clearer trend.
   ``Assuming the numbers are right, they are not inconsistent''
with the greenhouse warming theory, responded John Topping of the
Climate Institute, also pointing out that the study covers only the
United States.
   The new study, published in the January edition of Geophysical
Research Letters, showed no significant change in the nation's
average temperature or precipitation between 1895 and 1987.
   According to the greenhouse theory, the growing amounts of carbon
dioxide and some other gases in the atmosphere tend to trap heat
from the sun, warming the earth in somewhat the same way glass warms
a greenhouse.
   This drew widespread attention last summer as hot, dry weather
parched fields across much of the nation. Cooler fall temperatures
dropped the national average for the year back to near normal,
however.
   Scientists at last month's meeting of the American Geophysical
Union in San Francisco expressed skepticism about whether the effect
has already begun.
   In addition, some climate experts contend that warmer weather
would evaporate water to generate more clouds, and that those clouds
would then deflect some incoming sunlight and cool the earth.
   And a study published in the Journal of Climate in November
disclosed that an apparent climate warming of as much as 1 degree
Fahrenheit could be the fault of the heat generated by growing
cities, since many weather stations are located in urban areas.
   The new report was compiled by Kirby Hanson of the NOAA Air
Resources Laboratory, George A. Maul of the NOAA Atlantic
Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory and Thomas R. Karl of
the National Climatic Data Center.
   They looked at both temperature and moisture since the greenhouse
theory holds that a warming of the climate would likely result in
changes in rainfall patterns, causing drought in some areas.
   The study analyzed records from some 6,000 observing points over
93 years and found considerable year-to-year variation but no
long-term trend other than an increase in precipitation, in the
fall, between 1970 and 1987.

<HEAD>Genetic Tests Show Virus Associated with Multiple Sclerosis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A virus similar to the AIDS virus is closely
associated with the crippling disease multiple sclerosis, according
to U.S. and Swedish researchers using a sensitive genetic test of
blood cells.
   E. Prem Kumar Reddy, a researcher at Wistar Institute in
Philadelphia, said a study published today in the journal Science
provides ``direct proof'' that the human T-lymphotropic virus, or
HTLV-I, is involved in the MS disease process.
   Although HTLV-I and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that
causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, are not causing
the same disease, ``their basic mechanisms of infection are very,
very similar,'' Reddy said.
   ``Something that works for HIV should also work for HTLV-I,''
Reddy said in a telephone interview.
   Reddy and his associates at Wistar proved that there is HTLV-I in
the blood cells of multiple sclerosis patients by performing
extremely precise assays for the genetic pattern of the virus. As a
control, similar assays were performed on blood samples from 20
healthy people, 10 from Sweden and 10 in Philadelphia.
   The HTLV-I genetic pattern was found in each of six multiple
sclerosis patients tested at the University of Lund in Sweden. Of
the 20 healthy subjects, Reddy said the HTLV-I genetic pattern was
in only one.
   Reddy said the research proves that HTLV-I is ``associated'' with
multiple sclerosis, but it does not prove that the virus, by itself,
is the cause of the disease.
   Dr. Byron Waksman, vice president for research and medical
programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in New York,
said the study ``could lead to an important shift in how we approach
and treat this disease.'' But the study does not settle a debate
among experts on the precise disease process of MS, he said.
   He said some experts believe the crippling disease is an
``autoimmune process,'' in which the immune system, for unknown
reasons, attacks the body. Others, said Waksman, believe that MS is
caused directly by a virus, and still others suggest it is a
combination of both processes.
   ``It's an exciting lead, but clearly you need confirmation from
other laboratories,'' said Dr. Dale McFarlin, a MS expert at the
National Institutes of Health.
   He said much work still needs to be done to understand the HTLV
virus and its relationship to MS. The virus, he said, is implicated
in a number of diseases, including leukemia and a nervous system
disorder called tropical spastic paraparesis that resembles MS.
   And, yet, said McFarlin, the vast majority of people infected
with HTLV never develop any of these diseases. This suggests, he
said, that other factors, such as genetic patterns, are involved in
these diseases.
   Collaborating with Reddy in the study were four other scientists
at Wistar, a private research laboratory, and Magnhild
Sandberg-Wollheim of the University of Lund in Sweden.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, incurable disease that attacks
the brain and other parts of the central nervous system. The disease
strikes most frequently between the ages of 20 and 40, and there are
about 250,000 MS patients in the United States.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   As of Jan. 9, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 83,231 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 46,678, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from the
disease.

<HEAD>FTC Makes False Advertising Claim Against Campbell's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. should have mentioned the
sodium content of its soups in advertisements that claimed they were
good for the heart because of being low in fat and cholesterol, the
Federal Trade Commission says.
   Saying that the company's magazine ads a year ago were ``false,
misleading or deceptive,'' the FTC issued a complaint Thursday
against Campbell's, which said it would contest the allegation.
   The commission also charged that Campbell's had no substantiation
for its implied claim that ``most of its soups make a positive
contribution to a diet that reduces the risk of heart disease.''
   ``Health-related information is important to consumers, and
advertising is a principal source of that information,'' said
William MacLeod, head of the commission's Bureau of Consumer
Protection. ``This is why the commission demands accuracy in
advertising.''
   The offending ads ran in magazines in the winter of 1988 and then
were dropped for a new campaign. Company spokesman David Hackney
said the decision to end the ads had nothing to do with the
commission's investigation.
   MacLeod singled out a two-page ad that said Campbell's soups were
high in fiber, high in calcium when made with milk and low in fat
and cholesterol.
   ``A serving of regular Chicken Noodle, or new Special Request
with one-third less salt, is low in fat and has just 15 milligrams
of cholesterol. And that's especially good to know, because research
tells us that a diet low in fat and cholesterol may help reduce the
risk of some forms of heart disease,'' the ad said.
   Campbell's sells about two-thirds of the $2.2 billion worth of
soup sold in stores every year.
   The commission proposed that Campbell's be required to disclose
in its advertising the exact sodium content of any soup having more
than 500 milligrams per eight-ounce serving if the company claims
heart benefits for it.
   There was no request that the disclosure say anything about the
effects of sodium.
   Many manufacturers and cooks add it to food for better taste.
It's in dispute just how much sodium, part of ordinary table salt,
is bad.
   Humans need only 200 milligrams a day but most Americans probably
get 4,000 to 6,000 milligrams, the National Academy of Sciences said
in a recent report urging people to hold down intake to somewhere
between 1,100 to 3,300 milligrams.
   In many people, extra salt makes their blood pressure shoot up,
but in others blood pressure remains constant over wide variations
in salt intake.
   Hackney said Campbell would present experts that would dispute
any linkage between dietary sodium and high blood pressure. ``We
stand behind our advertising and don't think it's misleading,'' he
said.
   In a later statement from corporate headquarters, Campbell's said
it is the only major soup manufacturer to list sodium content, along
with other nutritional information, on the label.
   Not counting such variations as its ``Chunky'' line or its two
kinds of low-sodium soups, Campbell's makes 70 different condensed
soups in the familiar red-and-white cans.
   MacLeod declined to say what the commission staff knows about
their average sodium content, but a quick inspection of six on a
supermarket shelf showed sodium ranging from 710 milligrams in
turkey vegetable to 910 milligrams in chicken noodle. The
supermarket house brands were similar.

   Many buildings in earthquake-prone areas
should be constructed atop rubber shock absorbers to protect office
contents such as computers as well as human lives, experts are
telling major U.S. corporations.
   ``It's not adequate anymore to just think about stopping building
collapse,'' says Robert J. Kuntz, president of the California
Engineering Foundation, a nonprofit education group that sponsored a
two-day conference to make engineers aware of the shock absorbers.
   ``You've got to protect the hundreds of millions of dollars of
equipment inside these buildings and allow the enterprise to remain
functional,'' he said. ``This goes beyond protecting life and limb.''
   Kuntz and others urged companies in quake-prone areas nationwide
to consider building new low- and medium-rise buildings _ and even
refurbishing old ones _ using ``seismic base isolation,'' which
involves placing large, flexible shock absorbers between a building
and its foundation.
   The meeting, which ends today, drew about 100 engineers and
officials from major corporations and government institutions
including the Air Force, Rockwell International, TRW and
Hewlett-Packard Co. It was sponsored by Kuntz's group, the National
Science Foundation, the California Manufacturers Association and
others.
   Participants took buses to nearby Rancho Cucamonga to tour San
Bernardino County's 4-year-old, $32 million Foothill Communities Law
and Justice Center.
   The five-level courthouse was built atop 98 cylinder-shaped
rubber shock absorbers, or bearings, which measure 30 inches across
by 17 inches high and are made of alternating layers of rubber and
steel, said Douglas Way, of Base Isolation Consultants, the San
Francisco firm that designed the system.
   It was te first U.S. building and largest in the world to be
built on the shock absorbers, and was designed to withstand a
``great'' quake measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale on the San
Andreas Fault 12 miles away.
   Engineers usually make buildings resistant to quakes by
strengthening them and bolting them down solidly. But even if
buildings resist collapse, the businesses inside can be crippled by
damage to computers and other equipment, Kuntz said.
   The shock absorbers are appropriate only for buildings up to
about 12 levels, said civil engineer professor James Kelley, of the
University of California at Berkeley. Taller buildings vibrate more
slowly during major quakes and don't require the devices, which also
might make the skyscrapers vulnerable to tipover, he said.
   Japan now has about 20 buildings on shock absorbers, Salt Lake
City has two, New Zealand one, and a planned University of Southern
California hospital also will be built upon them, Kelly said.
   Less advanced shock absorbers, unacceptable by U.S. standards,
are beneath some buildings in China, France, Mexico and Yugoslavia,
he added.
   Rep. George Brown Jr., D-Calif., criticized the American
construction industry for failing to keep competitive with Japanese
builders in using the shock absorbers.
   ``The United States has done quite well in making new advances in
earthquake engineering. We have not done as well in using this new
knowledge to make buildings safer,'' Brown said, adding they should
be used in new buildings and nuclear power plants.
   ``At this rate in 20 years ... we'll just buy
earthquake-resistant buildings from Japan,'' he added.
   Many corporations haven't considered base isolation technology
because it is new and expensive, Kuntz said.
   Kelly said the shock absorbers add about 5 percent to the cost of
a new building, but that the devices buffer a building from shaking
so much that costs of reinforcement could be reduced.
   The prevention of damage also makes them economical, said
Alexander Tarics, president of Base Isolation Consultants.
   Major and great quakes, those measuring 7 to 8 or more on the
Richter scale, could cause $20 billion to $100 billion damage in
Southern California and $40 billion to $60 billion in losses in
northern California, not to mention thousands of deaths, according
to a summary of previous government reports by the engineering
foundation.

   John Tower told senators it would be
``unrealistic'' to think Star Wars could shield everyone in the
country from a nuclear holocaust, an outlook that differs from
former President Reagan's optimism about the space-based missile
defense system.
   Cautioning that he didn't want to get ``out in front'' of
President Bush's statements on the Strategic Defense Initiative, the
defense secretary-designate said that SDI was part of an effort to
move nuclear strategy from an offensive to a defensive focus.
   But, he cautioned, ``it remains to be seen whether that is a
realistic objective.''
   On the second day of confirmation hearings Thursday before the
Senate Armed Services Committee, Tower also said he will be
impartial despite having received more than $1 million in consulting
fees from seven defense contractors.
   ``I intend to be very, very objective,'' the former Texas senator
told the panel he once chaired. ``There will always be people who
will be skeptical. I learned during the past two months that not
everybody loves me.''
   Tower made his remarks about SDI under questioning from Sen. Al
Gore Jr., D-Tenn., who said Tower's pessimism ``represents a view
markedly different from the public's perception of President
Reagan's advocacy of a perfect defensive umbrella.''
   Reagan launched the program five years ago and said it should be
aimed at building a ballistic missile defense (BMD) that would
protect Americans from Soviet nuclear attack.
   Bush said during last fall's campaign that he favored deployment
of a limited SDI system as soon as possible.
   Tower told the committee: ``To begin with, I don't believe that
we can devise a BMD umbrella that can protect the entire American
population from nuclear incineration. I think that's unrealistic.''
   Discussing his consulting work, Tower testified that over a
three-year period he received $1,028,777 in fees from defense
contractors, including such industry giants as Rockwell
International, Martin-Marietta and LTV.
   Other companies were British Aerospace, Hicks &amp; Associates,
Jeford-McManus International Inc., and Textron Inc.
   Tower said he broke his ties with defense companies on Dec. 1
last year, one day after learning from Bush's transition staff that
he was under serious consideration for the defense post.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, expressed his
concern about Tower's former ties, saying, ``the difficulty here is
not that you have worked for a contractor as a consultant, but a
number of them, five or six or seven of the major corporations.''
   ``If you were to recuse (not involve) yourself on all of them,
you couldn't be secretary of defense,'' he said.
   In his testimony, Tower also urged Congress to tighten
``revolving-door'' laws to prevent officials ``from profiting
unfairly, unethically or illegally or inordinately'' if they move
between Pentagon and industry jobs.
   But he cautioned Congress that it should write such laws
``carefully enough so that honest, hardworking people who might want
to engage in public service are not summarily proscribed'' from
working at the Pentagon.
   Under questioning from Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., about the Soviet
Union's military superiority, Tower acknowledged that ``at this
moment, they have the capability to prevail in an invasion of
western Europe.''
   Hearings on Tower's nomination resume on Tuesday when
conservative Paul Weyrich, chairman of Coalitions for America, and
William G. Phillips, president of the National Council for
Industrial Defense, are scheduled to testify against the nomination.

   Both the dollar and stock prices rose sharply in
Tokyo Friday, buoyed by strong overnight performances in foreign
markets.
   The dollar opened at 128.42 yen and moved between 128.40 and
128.80 yen before closing the week at 128.65 yen, up 1.13 yen from
Thursday's closing.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues gained 134.32 points, or 0.42 percent, to close at a
record high of 31,646.13.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar's rise in Tokyo resulted from
expectations of an improvement in the U.S. gross national product,
scheduled to be released in Washington later Friday.
   The GNP is the total value of goods and services produced by a
nation in a given period of time.
   On the stock market, dealers said the Nikkei's gain was triggered
by the strong 25.18-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average
in New York on Thursday.

   Jesse Jackson broke bread with Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh and emerged saying he had great respect for his
integrity and for his commitment to enforcing civil rights laws.
   Jackson contrasted the Justice Department under Thornburgh, a
longtime member of the NAACP, to the department under former
President Reagan's earlier appointees that ``sometimes attempted to
sabotage'' civil rights by failing to enforce laws protecting
minorities.
   ``In some sense for the first time in eight years, the lights
have been turned back on in the Justice Department and hopefully the
dust will be cleared from the books,'' said Jackson.
   The civil rights activist said Thornburgh asked him during the
lunch Thursday to submit a list of people he would recommend to head
the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   He said he urged Thornburgh to appoint ``someone who is credible
and reputable with a commitment to fulfill the laws passed in 1965,
earned with the blood of modest people.''
   ``There must be a facing up to the fact that the jugular vein of
our democracy is justice,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson said that Thornburgh is committed to enforcing civil
rights law, unlike William Bradford Reynolds, who headed the
division under the Reagan administration.
   ``There is a considerable gap between the positions of Mr.
Reynolds and Attorney General Thornburgh and their life history and
their commitment to social justice,'' said Jackson, who was an
unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination
last year.
   ``I have happened to know Attorney General Thornburgh for some
time,'' Jackson told reporters. ``I have great regard for his
integrity, for his intelligence, and for his courage, and for his
commitment.''
   Thornburgh, standing next to Jackson at a news conference after
the lunch, said, ``This department is committed, as is the
president, to the full enforcement of the civil rights laws of the
United States and the full enjoyment of equal opportunity by all of
its citizens.
   ``We will differ, I am sure, from time to time, as to how that
can best be accomplished,'' the attorney general said.
   ``But I think it would be foolhardy not to sit down and counsel
together. The ideas that Rev. Jackson gave us today will get full
consideration and we hope to continue the discussion.''
   Jackson also said he urged Thornburgh to ask President Bush to
convene a White House conference on civil rights ``to take a
comprehensive look at reviving and renewing our quest for justice in
the country.''
   A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Thornburgh would relay Jackson's proposal to Bush.
   Jackson was accompanied by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., Delegate
Jaime Fuster of Puerto Rico and chairman of the House Hispanic
Caucus, and several other civil rights leaders.

<HEAD>Erosion Control Tops List of USDA Priorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soil erosion from water runoff and wind is the
main enemy of American farmers and consumers, and will rank at the
top of the Agriculture Department's hit list the rest of this
century.
   ``Erosion control remains the top priority because, of all the
problems addressed by USDA conservation programs, erosion is the
most widespread threat to long-term agricultural productivity and
environmental quality,'' the department reported Thursday.
   Erosion is outpacing soil replenishment, passing the
``tolerance'' level accepted by most conservationists, on an
estimated 277 million acres of non-federal rural land _ an area
larger than California and Texas combined.
   ``About 173 million of these acres are cropland, on which erosion
was 2.3 billion tons in 1982,'' the report said. ``If left
unchecked, erosion will reduce the ability of the soil to produce
needed food and fiber.''
   Further, it said, the silt from eroded soil can damage land, air
and water. Total costs are virtually impossible to pinpoint, but one
study estimates that water erosion alone costs the nation $3 billion
to $13 billion each year.
   The report updated the department's National Conservation Program
developed in 1982 in response to the Soil and Water Resources
Conservation Act of 1977. The law, or RCA, required long-range
conservation planning by the department for programs affecting soil
and water conservation on non-federal lands.
   Assistant Secretary George Dunlop said that the protection of
water quality ranks with erosion abatement in the Agriculture
Department's list of priorities. In 1982, he said, the priorities
were erosion control, and water conservation and upstream flood
control.
   In the early 1980s, there was a drop in world demand, a global
recession and serious debt problems in many importing countries. At
the same time, world agricultural production was rising, and
surpluses grew.
   One result was renewed attention to conservation and the 1977
law's process for looking ahead to solving soil and water problems,
the report said.
   The 1985 farm law included authorization of the Conservation
Reserve Program, or CRP, which enables farmers to take highly
erodible land from crop production for 10 years and protect it with
grass and tree plantings.
   Congress set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres in the CRP
by the end of 1990. About 28.2 million acres have been enrolled in
the program.
   According to the report, the CRP already has had a major impact
on erosion and is currently saving 530 million tons of soil
annually. By 1995, it said, the fully operational CRP is expected to
save 800 million tons of soil per year, thus reducing total U.S.
erosion losses on non-federal land by 15 percent.
   The 1985 law also included requirements that farmers have
conservation plans completed to help protect land and water
resources, or risk losing price supports and other federal benefits.
   Robert J. Gray, policy director for the private, non-profit
American Farmland Trust, said the USDA figures on saving soil are
impressive but that ``no one has been able to really spot check the
fields'' to determine if the claims are correct.
   ``The jury is still out on how effectively they're going to
enforce these conservation compliance plans,'' Gray said in a
telephone interview. ``They claim that they're going to have all the
plans in place by 1990.''

   The Agriculture Department says cattle feedlot
inventories in the nation's 13 leading beef states totaled 9.41
million head as of Jan. 1, down 4 percent from a year ago but 2
percent more than two years ago.
   Only California, Idaho and Kansas showed increases from a year
ago, while decreases were reported in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois,
Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.
Minnesota was unchanged.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during October, November
and December totaled 5.49 million head, a 2 percent decrease from
the same period of 1987 but 2 percent more than in 1986, the report
said Thursday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the final
quarter of the year totaled 6.65 million head, down 1 percent from
the previous year and 2 percent fewer than in the same period of
1986.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.73 million head
during January, February and March, down 2 percent from last year's
first quarter and down fractionally from 1987, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef. The
first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Jan. 1,
and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   Soybean farmers are still being affected by
crop prospects in Brazil and Argentina, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   Combined production of the two countries is forecast at 31
million metric tons, up 3.3 million tons from last year, the
department's Economic Research Service said Thursday.
   ``However, prospects are more uncertain this year because of
delayed plantings in both countries and dry weather, especially in
Argentina,'' the report said. ``The size of the South American crop
will influence soybean prices and U.S. plantings in 1989.''
   U.S. soybean production last year, the lowest since 1976, dropped
to about 1.54 billion bushels, or 41.9 million tons. A metric ton is
about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of soybeans.

<TEXT>
   A select group of scientists whose military
work is often cloaked in secrecy is reviewing research that
concluded a linear accelerator may be a cheaper, safer and quicker
way than building new reactors to produce nuclear weapons material.
   The JASON Group, which the Defense Department has consulted on
projects involving complex technology since the late 1950s, was
briefed on the research late last week in La Jolla, Calif.
   Participants included researchers from Los Alamos and Brookhaven
national laboratories and the Westinghouse-Hanford Co., who for more
than a year have been exploring the possibility of using an
accelerator to produce tritium.
   In a summary report prepared last summer, they said an
accelerator could be built more quickly than a reactor, would be
cheaper to construct and operate and would produce far less
radioactive waste.
   But Department of Energy officials have said the linear
accelerator technology is not ``mature'' enough to justify changing
the department's plan to build two new tritium-producing reactors.
   The Energy Department's existing tritium-producing reactors, at
the Savannah River complex in South Carolina, have been beset with
safety problems and are currently shut down.
   The schedule for restarting them continues to slip, leading to
warnings that a tritium shortage may develop. The radioactive
substance must be periodically replenished in nuclear warheads.
   William Kato, chairman of the nuclear energy department at
Brookhaven and one of those who attended the JASON briefing, said
the group's members ``seemed to be very enthusiastic and highly
supportive'' of the accelerator alternative.
   Kato said the ``normal practice'' of the JASON Group would be to
write a report that ``I assume would go to the Department of Defense
and Department of Energy.''
   The JASON program is administered by MITRE Corp., a non-profit
engineering and research firm which acts as a Defense Department
think tank and is often engaged in classified programs. A MITRE
spokeswoman confirmed that the briefing took place.
   ``The JASONS have not yet decided whether or not to give the
matter further consideration,'' said Joanne Briggs.
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target,
in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision
produces tritium, a radioactive gas.
   Chris Sankey, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said Thursday
that as a ``long-range option to augment, not replace, our plans for
two new production reactors, we may undertake additional evaluation
of the accelerator concept. That would take place when a concrete
proposal is presented to the department.''
   Ms. Sankey said that while the department supports
``state-of-the-art technology for our programs, we can't appropriate
money and base decisions on what we think is going on in the
scientific community.''
   The department has announced plans to build new tritium-producing
reactors at Savannah River and the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory in Idaho Falls.
   The JASON Group comprises about 55 scientists who do
``sophisticated scientific research and analysis in support of the
national security community,'' said Jan Bodanyi, a spokeswoman for
the Defense Department.
   The JASON Group has studied everything from parts of the Star
Wars missile defense system to ways to detect plastic guns, she said.

   Government lawyer Kristina Nygaard carries work
home at night. Legal papers, dealing with the licensing of
hydroelectric power projects. She spreads them over the dining room
table.
   Morton Klevan says he is proud of his work for the government,
but wouldn't advise his kids to go into it, ``not unless they made a
bundle, first.'' He owns a house he says he couldn't afford to buy
now.
   James McGovern is assistant to the chief counsel of the IRS. He
has seen five commissioners come and go. He is ``very proud'' of his
work. Does he think the public unfairly beats up on the civil
service? ``No comment on that,'' he says.
   They were among three government careerists _ the top of the
cream, senior civil servants earning between $67,800 and $80,000 a
year _ who, as they sat listening to their new boss Thursday, tried
to explain to a reporter why they think they should make more.
   In a nutshell: They like the work, but people with commensurate
responsibilities on the outside earn far more.
   ``I'm not unhappy. I have made a free choice to stay in
government,'' said Klevan. ``But I had to borrow money to send my
kids to college.''
   They were in the audience Thursday when President Bush drove
around the corner to Constitution Hall to address 3,000 of the 8,000
members of the government's senior executive service: the career
managers who stay when political appointees come and go.
   He didn't tell them what they most wanted to know _ whether he
would recommend that Congress accept, reject or modify the
substantial pay raise that's before Congress.
   It would give Congress and top officials 50 percent increases,
and top civil servants raises as big or almost as big. A senior
executive earning $67,800 would go to $80,000. One at the top,
getting $80,000, would go to $120,000.
   But Bush told his audience the next best thing: that he
considered himself one of them.
   ``What we do have in common is that each of us is here to serve
the American people,'' he said. ``Each of us is here because of a
belief in public service as the highest and noblest calling.''
   Miss Nygaard, assistant general counsel for hydroelectric
licensing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said she
liked what she heard from Bush _ that ``by and large we can be
trusted; we do not, by and large, have a private agenda, and, by and
large, we simply want to be highly professional.''
   She said the spread between the $76,400 she makes and what she
could make is widening.
   Enough to lure her away? ``They're pushing their luck.''
   Klevan, senior director, Office of Policy and Legislative
Analysis in the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration, said he helps safeguard the American people's
private pensions and health and welfare plans in which $1.5 trillion
is invested.
   Son of a plumber, he graduated eighth in his class at Harvard Law
School. A few years ago, he said, he earned $57,500 a year in the
government and turned down a job paying $100,000.
   He's happy in his work, yet he had to borrow to send his kids to
college. Youngsters just out of law school with academic records
like his can start work earning the $70,000 a year he gets now.
   ``I have to stress I'm not complaining,'' he said. ``If I were
unhappy, I could go anytime. What keeps me in government is the
intrinsic interest in what we're doing. ... It's important work,
with enormous impact.''
   Helmut Hellwig, principal adviser to the undersecretary for
technology in the Department of Commerce, said he has put in two
stints in government, taking off 10 years to be president of a New
England electronics company.
   He said he puts in 60 hours a week, leaving home at 6:30 a.m.,
returning by 7:30 p.m., and when he goes in on weekends he is far
from alone at the office.
   ``I gave up a job paying $100,000 in 1986 to come back to
government to a job that's now paying $70,000,'' he said. ``That's
OK, I returned for idealistic reasons. But what worries me is that
government isn't getting idealistic young people. I'm one of the
young ones here. I'm 50.''

   James A. Baker III faced a major decision on
his first working day as Secretary of State _ deciding to evacuate
the handful of U.S. officials threatened by the spreading civil war
in Afghanistan.
   Baker remained out of the public eye at the agency on Thursday,
but the increased turmoil in Kabul required his immediate attention.
   The secretary's circumspect day stood in sharp contrast to the
last change of administration in 1981, when Secretary of State
Alexander Haig entered the building and boasted that President
Reagan had annointed him ``the vicar of American foreign policy.''
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be named, said
Baker's predecessor, George Shultz, had decided to leave the
decision on whether to close the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to the new
administration. Baker moved the morning after taking his oath of
office, the official said.
   The decision to evacuate the U.S. employees came as the Soviets
continued to pull out troops that have been in the country since
1979 and as fighting has increased between the pro-Moscow government
and U.S.-backed rebels battling for control.
   Although a more formal swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for this
evening at the White House, Baker had been sworn in privately
Wednesday evening at the State Department, hours after he was
confirmed by the Senate as President Bush's chief adviser on foreign
policy.
   Baker, one of Bush's closest friends and the man who managed the
final months of his campaign for the White House, kept a low profile
during his first working day and no schedule was released about his
activities.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman declined to specify any of
Baker's plans for the day, except to say that he was ``getting
established, that's his first priority.''
   Redman noted that Baker had ``met with his top people.''
   Asked by a reporter to identify those people _ so that clues
might be drawn about those in line for top slots during the new
administration's overhaul of personnel _ Redman only smiled.
   The spokesman did say, however, that the new secretary planned to
accompany Bush on his first major foreign trip overseas, to Japan
and China next month.
   True to the former Treasury secretary's crisp and formal style,
Baker wore a suit and tie as he held early-morning meetings with top
aides in his formal office workspace, said one senior official who
met with him.
   Shultz had been known for striking a more informal tone, meeting
with aides in the cozy sitting room next to the office, doffing his
suit coat for a sweater and poking intermittently at the embers in
his fireplace.
   The new secretary also took a cue from Bush and emphasized high
standards in the first message he sent to U.S. diplomats and State
Department employees around the world.
   ``I join with President Bush in emphasizing that public service
should conform to the highest standards of ethical performance,''
Baker wrote in the message cabled to all State Department employees
around the globe. ``For me, ethics means not only abiding by the
letter of public service by also the spirit _ not only in what we
do, but how we do it.''
   Bush had stressed ethics during his campaign in an attempt to
neutralize the criticism aimed at the Reagan administration for its
ethical problems.

<HEAD>Shellshocked Farmers Fear Another Dry Year Amid Winter Of Discontent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Farmers shellshocked by the 1988 drought are worrying anew
whether the unusually warm winter will break, sending them the
precipitation they need for next year's crops.
   ``There's a pervading omen, a feeling of ominous concern. I sense
it with other farmers, I sense it with the salesmen of agricultural
products,'' said Joe Summer, a corn and soybean farmer in McLean
County in central Illinois.
   Parts of the county have received 25 inches less rain than
average in 22 months. For the first time in 45 years of farming,
Summer is taking out multiperil insurance on next season's crop.
   The warm, dry winter had something to do with that decision, he
said Thursday, but so did bad crops in six of the last eight years
in what used to be the nation's top corn-producing county.
   ``We're all beginning to get a little paranoid about it,'' the
62-year-old farmer said. ``There is no frost in the ground. This
unusually warm weather is strange. It is a harbinger of some sort, I
think.''
   According to the National Weather Service, severe to extreme
drought conditions continue in much of the northern Great Plains,
northern Rockies and parts of the Midwest.
   The weather service's most recent precipitation map shows extreme
drought in Montana, the Dakotas, central Minnesota, eastern Iowa,
northwestern Illinois and much of Wyoming, eastern Idaho, central
Washington and eastern Oregon, said meteorologist Dave Miskus of the
Climate Analysis Center in Washington, D.C.
   However, the most recent 30-day forecast calls for above-normal
precipitation, said meteorologist Edward O'Lenic, also of the
Climate Analysis Center.
   The northern Great Plains and northern Rockies need as much as 8
inches above normal rainfall to end the drought, while Iowa and
Illinois need 8 to 9 inches more than normal, Miskus said.
   The weather service will not release its spring forecast until
after the commodities markets close Monday, but O'Lenic said there
is no reason to expect more of the drought that hit the nation last
summer.
   Even so, farmers and Farm Bureau officials are worried.
   ``At this stage, we're hoping for a terribly wet spring,'' said
Minnesota Farm Bureau administrator Gerald Hagaman. ``There's
apprehension.''
   Farm Bureau officials in Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois
and Iowa say much the same thing.
   ``Our moisture levels are still down. We don't have adequate
moisture in the soil and we could have a problem if we don't have
above-average rainfall this spring,'' said Don Henderson, vice
president of the Indiana Farm Bureau.
   Indiana farmers are also worried about the mild temperatures,
which have averaged a relatively balmy 34.1 degrees this month. Such
weather ``doesn't kill a lot of the pests,'' Henderson said.
``That's a major problem to us.''
   In Wisconsin, ``the real question for farmers is how much snow
we'll get,'' said state Farm Bureau President Don Haldeman. ``We
came off the driest year we've ever had, and they're wondering if
we'll have another year of drought.''
   ``It's a major topic of discussion when farmers get together,''
agreed Jerry Snethen of the Farm Bureau in Iowa, which saw some of
the worst of the 1988 drought.
   Spring rains will moisten the top inches, but farmers have lost
deep soil moisture, their one insurance against drought, said Dennis
Vercler of the Illinois Farm Bureau.
   ``It sets up a scenario similar to 1988,'' he said.``This is
concerning a lot of people, even though it is fairly early. They're
edgy about it. We're going into the season needing just the right
rain at just the right time.''
   Farmers aren't the only ones affected by the winter of discontent.
   In Milwaukee, springlike temperatures and below-average snowfall
forced Icebreaker Winter Funfest organizers to move ice-sculpting
events inside a refrigerated ice house. The U.S. International Snow
Sculpting Competition, a major festival event, was saved only
because huge blocks of snow from a storm last month had been saved.
   In New England, the lack of precipitation forced ski resorts to
use machine-made snow until storms in the past couple weeks, and has
Boston officials concerned there may be a water shortage this
summer. The warm, dry weather has also cut heating and municipal
snow-removal costs.
   Maine had more familiar weather Thursday, when a driving
snowstorm dumped up to 6 inches of snow on the state, closing
schools and delaying flights.
   ``It's been an abnormal winter,'' said George Wiseman of the
weather service's Portland, Maine, office. ``This is closer to
normal.''

<HEAD>Delaying Tactics Feared in Hastings Impeachment Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators must decide whether to tie up the
floor for six weeks or more with the impeachment trial of District
Judge Alcee L. Hastings or sidetrack the proceedings into a
committee.
   Lawmakers expressed concern Thursday at a Senate Rules Committee
hearing that the case could drag out painfully and some said there
was a possibility it would be prolonged even more by defense
delaying tactics.
   The 52-year-old Miami judge, however, said he is entitled to have
the entire Senate hear the evidence that prompted the House on Aug.
3 to vote 413-3 in favor of a total of 17 articles of impeachment
against him.
   ``This is not an agriculture bill,'' Hastings told reporters
Thursday following the committee hearing. ``This is my office that
is at stake here.''
   The impeachment articles say Hastings conspired to obtain a
$150,000 payoff from two convicted racketeers in return for keeping
them out of prison.
   Hastings also is accused of lying during the 1983 trial in which
a jury acquitted him of the bribery conspiracy.
   The articles also say Hastings disclosed wiretap information in
an unrelated matter and thus scuttled a federal criminal
investigation.
   The Rules Committee must recommend by Wednesday whether the full
Senate should hear evidence against Hastings or delegate the task to
a committee.
   A committee was empaneled for the job two years ago, when the
Senate convicted District Judge Harry E. Claiborne following his
impeachment by the House. At the time, Claiborne was in prison for
tax evasion but attempting to keep his seat on the bench.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, expressed concern that Hastings might
employ delaying tactics to foil any effort to strip him of his
$89,500-a-year job.
   ``How do we know that the Senate will not be subjected to the
same shenanigans that went on in the district court?'' Stevens asked.
   Conservative estimates put the length of the proceeding at six
weeks but there is wide skepticism about that forecast. ``I think it
would be longer than that,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., the
committee chairman.
   In another development, Hastings' attorney, Terence J. Anderson,
demanded that the Senate provide taxpayers' funds to finance the
defense.
   ``The Constitution guarantees that a judge's compensation in
office may not be diminished,'' Anderson said. He acknowledged,
however, that government payment of the defense costs incurred in an
impeachment case would be unprecedented.

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T says it has labored under unfair pricing
regulations for too long, and the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission tends to agree.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick says it may be time to give AT&amp;T a
break _ sort of _ and perhaps save telephone users billions of
dollars.
   But some lawmakers say the FCC doesn't have the legal right to
make such a change.
   Nonetheless, the commission will consider the subject Monday in a
meeting that is sure to attract legions of attorneys and lobbyists
who've formed battle lines on all sides of the issue.
   The FCC, under the deregulation-prone Patrick, has proposed to
change the way the telephone industry leader, American Telephone and
Telegraph Co., sets its prices for interstate services.
   Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed AT&amp;T a certain
profit beyond its costs. But the FCC in August 1987 suggested
replacing this ``rate-of-return'' regulation for ``dominant
carriers'' such as AT&amp;T with ceilings on prices. That would include
the seven regional Bell companies that AT&amp;T spun off in 1984.
   The commission said the change would encourage greater efficiency
and innovation and save customers $1.6 billion over four years if
all the dominant companies participated.
   The FCC last May proposed that AT&amp;T be allowed to raise rates 3
percent less than annual inflation.
   AT&amp;T applauded the proposal.
   ``It's a long overdue step,'' Larry Garfinkel, AT&amp;T vice
president for marketing services, said in an interview Thursday. He
said AT&amp;T has been ``thwarted'' by a cumbersome regulatory process
that has prevented speedy introduction of new services and discount
rates.
   He said competitors routinely file challenges to any new AT&amp;T
discount pricing plan, claiming the plans are designed to undercut
competition.
   ``They never intervene to drive our prices down. They intervene
to drive our prices up,'' Garfinkel said.
   ``We have (business) customers shaking their heads in disbelief
at what it takes for us to get a simple change in service
offering,'' said Joe Nacchio, AT&amp;T vice president for business
services.
   ``If we've got better flexibility to earn we will then be able to
take those investments and reinvest,'' Nacchio added.
   Members of Congress are skeptical, however. A report last
November from the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee said the FCC proposal fails to
assure that rates for regulated phone service will be ``just and
reasonable,'' as required by the 1934 Communications Act.
   Congress intended, the report said, that rates balance carriers'
right for a return on investment and consumers' right to prices in
line with the costs of providing service.
   ``As currently structured, the price cap scheme will permit
carriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs,''
the report said. ``There is no assurance that rates would remain
even with a `zone' of reasonableness.''
   Last week, in an attempt to allay concerns on Capitol Hill,
Patrick sent a six-page letter and 60 pages of supporting documents
to the chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee, Rep. Edward
J. Markey, D-Mass., and to John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
full Energy and Commerce Committee.
   He assured Markey and Dingell that the process leading up to the
price cap proposal had been subjected to a rigorous hearing process
and that ``the record indicated that it might be possible to replace
the distorted incentives created by rate-of-return regulation with
more efficiency-oriented and consumer-oriented price cap incentives
by making modest changes in existing rules and procedures.''
   However, he said he would recommend a number of changes in the
price cap proposal, including a delay in implementing the plan for
the regional Bell companies and other local exchange carriers.
   He said he also would recommend establishing separate price cap
``baskets'' for AT&amp;T's business and residential customers to prevent
the company from raising residential prices to finance rate
reductions for businesses.
   ``These improvements also will provide residential customers
greater assurances of rate stability _ and a larger share of
potential AT&amp;T efficiency gains,'' Patrick said.
   He also proposed an ``automatic stabilizer'' which he said would
ensure that local carriers' earnings ``remain within the zone of
reasonableness and that consumers share in the efficiency gains
price cap regulation is designed to generate.''

<HEAD>Ban on `Indecent' Broadcasting Held Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television broadcasters dodged a bullet today
thanks to an appeals court ruling that stopped federal regulators
from imposing a round-the-clock ban on ``indecent'' programs.
   The congressionally mandated ban, which was to have gone into
effect at 12:01 a.m., would have ended the midnight-to-6 a.m. ``safe
harbor'' that the Federal Communications Commission had established
for sexually explicit TV programs.
   But a coalition of broadcasters and civil rights groups
challenged the ban on constitutional grounds, and the court agreed
to a temporary stay while it considered the case.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who wrote the indecency amendment into
a $14.9 billion appropriations bill last year, said Thursday he felt
he would win the issue in the Supreme Court.
   ``With the makeup of the court as it is now, I can't imagine
they'll duck the opportunity to protect children and society in
general from this sort of garbage,'' Helms said in a telephone
interview. ``I believe the founding fathers never believed that the
First Amendment could be so distorted to authorize, to permit this
sort of garbage.''
   During congressional debate, Helms had claimed the FCC was
permitting broadcasters to air programs that included ``disgusting
bestiality, sodomy and child sex.''
   The 24-hour ban was stayed on Monday by the federal appeals court
in Washington. The National Association of Broadcasters, which was
among 17 challengers to the ban, said the court's ruling ``was a
hopeful sign.''
   ``What's not at issue here is the kind of pornographic matter
that much of the general public is concerned about,'' Steve
Bookshester, associate general counsel for the NAB, said Thursday.
   ``Indecency is a pretty loaded word. How can you be in favor of
indecency? But the FCC definition of that term is pretty broad,'' he
said.
   ``You don't have a bunch of people who are making dirty movies.
... That's not what this case is about,'' Bookshester said.
   Indecent material, according to the FCC, is that which ``in
context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.''
   The Washington appeals court last July upheld that definition,
but said the FCC had not justified the midnight-to-6 a.m. safe
harbor. Broadcasters had been seeking a 10 p.m. start of the safe
harbor.
   Obscene broadcasts, on the other hand, do not enjoy
constitutional protection. Such broadcasts are defined as those that
appeal to prurient interests and lack serious artistic, literary,
political or scientific value.
   FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said the court action had thrown
the issue of indecent programming into limbo. The court issued only
a stay of the rules as it considered the challenge.
   ``It keeps us where we are,'' she said. That means the FCC will
continue to take action against ``indecent'' programming broadcast
during daylight hours _ which the courts have upheld.
   As for nighttime programs, ``If we receive complaints ... those
are being accepted and filed and put on hold until this whole matter
is clarified,'' she said.
   The rules apply only to over-the-air broadcasts, not cable.
   Besides the NAB, those challenging the FCC rules were: Capital
Cities-ABC; CBS; Action for Children's Television; the Association
of Independent Television Stations; the Radio and Television News
Directors Association; ACLU Foundation; Infinity Broadcast Corp.;
the Motion Picture Association of America; NBC; National Public
Radio; the Pacifica Foundation; People for the Amercan Way;
Post-Newsweek Stations; the Public Broadcasting Service; the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press; and the Society of
Professional Journalists.

   Some of President Bush's high-ranking
transition aides are staying away from the federal government,
deciding instead to pursue careers in the private sector.
   In becoming consultants, lobbyists and public relations
executives, the aides are moving through the well-traveled revolving
door that separates government service from private business.
   Among those entering private business are Craig Fuller and Robert
Teeter, the co-directors of the Bush transition office, and Sheila
Tate, the transition spokeswoman.
   Teeter, a longtime political consultant, intends to start a new
firm, spending much of his time in Washington even though his family
will remain in Ann Arbor, Mich., according to his assistant, Mary
Lukens.
   Before he joined the Bush presidential campaign, Teeter ran a
political consulting firm in Detroit.
   Fuller, former chief of staff to Vice President Bush, will become
president of a lobbying firm headed by Anne Wexler, a former Carter
administration official, and Nancy Reynolds, who is a close friend
of former first lady Nancy Reagan.
   Fuller decided to go into private business after he lost out in a
power struggle with John Sununu to be the White House chief of staff.
   Mrs. Tate, Mrs. Reagan's former press secretary and a longtime
public relations executive, is going to work in public relations,
but she would not identify the company until the deal is completed.
   People who worked in government, such as Fuller, will be governed
by existing post-employment ethics laws. ``He is precluded from
lobbying the White House for a year, and you can bet he won't,''
said Mrs. Wexler.
   Fuller will be working on ``public strategies and corporate
communications,'' Mrs. Wexler said. Among the firm's clients are
American Airlines, the Motion Picture Association and Allied Corp.
   Like many others who worked in the Bush campaign and transition,
Mrs. Tate is not subject to the government's post-employment laws,
according to Jane Ley, an attorney with the Office of Government
Ethics.
   Fuller is perhaps the most prominent exception, based on his
service in the vice president's office. He is covered by rules that
impose a cooling-off period in which senior employees of an agency
who enter the private sector are barred from contacting officials of
that agency for a year, except for social affairs.
   There is also a lifetime ban that prohibits all executive branch
officials from lobbying on any issue in which they had a ``personal
and substantial'' involvement while in government.
   Another campaign operative choosing the private sector is Rich
Bond, 38, Bush's deputy campaign manager. Bond has started a
lobbying firm with Frank Donatelli, 39, a White House political
director under President Reagan.
   Donatelli, who also had served as assistant to Reagan for
intergovernmental affairs, said his motive for leaving government
was ``primarily financial.'' But he also expressed a desire to run
his own operation after spending five of the last eight years in
government.
   As a government official, Donatelli could earn no more than
$89,500.
   James Pfiffner, a George Mason University professor who has
examined the presidency and the federal government, said government
experience _ particularly a visible job _ can often enhance a
person's future earning potential.
   Those entering the private sector do so at a time that Bush has
stressed ethics in his administration.
   Bush, in the first days of his presidency, has vowed to press for
laws that clarify codes of conduct and ``protect the public
interest.''
   ``I support what he is doing ... I think it is great,'' said Mrs.
Tate.

   The leader of this week's assault
on an army base tried to overthrow the government in the 1970s and
helped assassinate deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza,
informed sources said.
   Enrique Gorriaran Merlo directed the attack Monday on the 3rd
Infantry Regiment base in the western suburb of La Tablada that
resulted in the death of 38 people, government and security sources
said Thursday.
   Gorriaran Merlo, 47, once led the now-defunct People's
Revolutionary Army, which openly battled the military after it took
power in a 1976 coup. He is believed to have escaped during a
27-hour siege in which army and police forces retook the base, the
sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Among the dead were eight soldiers and two policemen. One of the
policemen died Thursday of wounds suffered in the assault. About 70
others were wounded.
   But Gorriaran Merlo was not thought to be among the bodies of 14
armed civilians who remain unidentified, the sources said.
   The disclosure came as authorities probed links between the
attackers and left-wing organizations. The government claims the
assailants were leftist subversives.
   Police on Thursday raided several houses in Mar del Plata, 250
miles south of Buenos Aires, and arrested three people but gave no
other details.
   Gorriaran Merlo, a stocky former architecture student, was
involved in the Marxist People's Revolutionary Army, which was
decimated in the late 1970s during a harsh anti-subversion campaign
waged by the military leaders.
   Gorriaran Merlo, however, escaped and went to Nicaragua. In
published interviews, he said he led a team of Argentine and
Nicaraguan guerrillas who assassinated Somoza in 1980 on a street in
the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion. Somoza had been ousted by
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas in 1979.
   President Raul Alfonsin ordered the prosecution of Gorriaran
Merlo shortly after taking office in December 1983. Alfonsin's
election ended nearly eight years of military dictatorship.
   Gorriaran Merlo was believed to be living abroad. Last year, a
leftist human rights lawyer, Jorge Banos, asked the courts to allow
Gorriaran Merlo to return and face trial without being imprisoned.
   Police said among those killed in this week's assault was Banos.
He and at least two other attackers whose names have been released
by police were active in a leftist political group, the Everyone for
the Country Movement.
   The little-known movement, formed about three years ago,
denounced earlier this month what it said were plans for a coup by
right-wing extremists in the armed forces. Those elements have led
three dramatic but short-lived insurrections against Alfonsin since
April 1987.
   The army base's attackers carried a written proclamation that
said their action was designed to stop a coup and foment civilian
resistance to the military.
   The incident surprised and chilled Argentines, and prompted
Alfonsin to set up a National Security Council to evaluate and
curtail the threat of subversion.
   The group, composed of the chiefs of the military branches and
several government ministers, met for the first time Thursday.
Alfonsin presided. No details were provided.
   The centrist Radical government, with an eye to the excesses
committed by the military during its so-called ``dirty war'' against
subversion in the 1970s, until now has barred the military from a
major role in internal security.
   Human rights groups already have said they fear military
participation might mean a return to the deadly anti-leftist
repression of last decade, when at least 8,900 people were arrested
and vanished without a trace. They are presumed executed.
   The Buenos Aires daily newspaper Clarin, quoting government
sources, said Alfonsin's decree gives military intelligence agencies
authority to conduct domestic surveillance _ which previously was
illegal.

<HEAD>Political Fireworks Erupt Over Purchase Of Alabama TV Station</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The purchase of Montgomery's major TV
news station by the state pension fund has triggered a political
shootout among government officials and media executives, who call
it a dangerous conflict of interest.
   The chief antagonists are David Bronner, who manages Alabama's $8
billion pension fund, and Gov. Guy Hunt, who charges that Bronner
and a major critic of Hunt's Republican administration are secretly
trying to lay claim to news operations up and down the state.
   Hunt said recently the purchase of WSFA-TV, the state capital's
dominant broadcast news operation, was invalid because his state
finance director did not approve it.
   ``Watch our lips,'' said Hunt. ``It's null and void.''
   ``Make my day,'' replied Bronner, who said the purchase of WSFA
from Cosmos Broadcasting Inc. of Greenville, S.C., was a ``done
deal,'' and that the finance director, Robin Swift, had never asked
for advance sign-off approval on investments during Hunt's two years
in office.
   He said the state would lose $10 million in funds guaranteeing
the purchase if it backed out.
   Bronner signed the deal to buy WFSA for $70 million in
mid-December. He said the NBC affiliate was a ``cash cow'' that
would benefit the pension fund's 130,000 members and could establish
a precedent for purchases of media properties elsewhere.
   That's what worried Alabama newspaper and broadcast association
leaders, who said the deal created a dangerous conflict of interest
by putting government officials in a position to influence news
coverage at the capitol.
   Among those who oversee the pension program are Hunt, Swift,
State Treasurer George Wallace Jr., State School Superintendent
Wayne Teague and, not least, Paul Hubbert, the chief lobbyist for
public school teachers in Alabama and one of Hunt's biggest critics.
   Hunt made no public comment about the purchase until after a
potential political rival, former Gov. Fob James, lambasted the deal
in print. Then Hunt attacked it, too, in a manner that fired
political conflicts.
   ``I think it's pretty obvious who's behind this deal. It's Dr.
Paul Hubbert,'' said Hunt. ``I think it's time he and Dr. Bronner
now made public to the people their secret negotiations concerning
the attempt to purchase a Mobile TV station ... and how far they
intend to carry this.''
   Bronner had advised the pension board earlier that a Mobile
station, WALA-TV, had been placed on the market. He also said he was
looking at various other media properties. But he denied discussing
any purchases with Hubbert or other board members.
   ``This is all beginning to sound like `As The World Turns,''' he
said.
   Hubbert said he wasn't aware of any ``master plan'' to buy up
television stations around the state. ``If there is, I'm not privy
to it,'' he said.
   The Federal Communications Commission still must approve the
transfer of WSFA's broadcasting license from the current owners,
Cosmos Broadcasting Inc. of Greenville, S.C.
   However, Steve Sewell, assistant chief of the FCC's video
services division, said Thursday that the commission generally does
not involve itself in matters of state or local law, such as those
raised in the Alabama case.
   The FCC has set a deadline of Feb. 6 for any petitions objecting
to the WSFA purchase. None had been filed by Thursday.
   Sewell said there is no FCC rule or law that prohibits
state-created entities from holding broadcast licenses. In fact, he
said, there are numerous instances of state entities holding
broadcast licenses, the most common examples being public television
stations.
   So for now, the soap opera continues. State Attorney General Don
Siegleman has issued an advisory opinion upholding the purchase. But
Hunt said Siegleman's ruling ``is as worthless as the paper it's
written on.''
   The governor brought in his top political organizer, Birmingham
lawyer John Grenier, to consider legal action. Hunt predicted that a
lawsuit eventually would be filed, although not necessarily by his
administration.

<HEAD>R&amp;B Singer Brown Arrested For Violating Columbus' Anti-Lewdness Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rhythm and blues singer Bobby Brown,
arrested during a performance for violating Columbus' anti-lewdness
ordinance, paid a $652 fine at the local jailhouse and returned to
finish his show, authorities said.
   Brown, whose latest hit is ``My Prerogative,'' was arrested
during a concert at the city's Municipal Auditorium Wednesday night.
   ``He brought a woman up from the audience and was dancing around
her, then got right up to her and began hunching'' in a simulation
of sexual intercourse, said Police Major John Wood.
   When Brown came off the stage for a moment at 8:30 p.m., Sgt.
Bobby Horne, who heads up security at the Municipal Auditorium,
arrested him and charged him with violating the city's anti-lewdness
ordinance.
   The law prohibits performers at an event attended by persons
under the age of 18 to show nudity or sexual pictures or models, or
to use ``four-letter sexual words.''
   Brown was off stage for about an hour being booked at the
Muscogee County Jail. He paid a $652 fine, came back on stage about
an hour later and announced that he'd been at jail, Wood said.
   The ordinance was passed after antics at a 1987 Beastie Boys
concert offended some parents. Rap performer LL Cool J was the first
to be arrested under the ordinance. Gene Simmons, bass player for
the rock group Kiss, was later arrested for pulling his pants down.

<HEAD>Mall Tours, Targeting America's `New Main Street,' Update An Old
Gimmick</HEAD>

   In a glitzy update of an old sales gimmick, an
entertainment conglomerate has transformed the 19th century medicine
show into the mall tour, a celebration of consumerism aimed at
America's ``new Main Street.''
   MCA Inc.'s ``The Magic of Hollywood Tour,'' entering its first
weekend on the road today at the Topanga Plaza Shopping Center, aims
to swivel the heads of about 4 million mall visitors in 45 cities
nationwide, in hopes of giving MCA a slim advantage in the fierce
battle for leisure-time dollars.
   ``It's a very effective way of promoting MCA product,'' said Phil
Rosenthal, vice president of MCA Event Marketing. ``It takes us
right to the consumer, right into the new Main Street _ the shopping
mall.''
   Yet there are already indications that the mall tour, which MCA
pioneered in launching teen-age singer Tiffany in a 1987 mall
junket, may have become too popular for its own good.
   The scheduled opening of ``The Magic of Hollywood Tour'' was
canceled last week when a Glendale fire marshal said unpredictable
attendance could threaten shopper safety.
   And The Boys, an urban band that was to have performed alongside
the more upscale Boys Club, was dropped from the tour soon after a
local December mall concert featuring the quartet became
unmanageable.
   ``There was a potential for a major disaster there,'' said Sgt.
Mike Effler. MCA says the band was dropped only because ``they
became too big'' for mall venues.
   The mall tour's liability, though, is also its greatest virtue _
free, unlimited access to entertainment. And that's why MCA is
banking on strong turnouts across the country, from Seattle to
Chicago to Miami to Houston.
   Using a live performance by the young vocalists Boys Club,
interactive product displays, occasional celebrity appearances,
Hollywood memorabilia and an assortment of carnival games with
prizes, MCA can expose shoppers to all of its entertainment
divisions in one invasion.
   The entire tour, Rosenthal said, will cost less than $1 million.
   While MCA Records is the star attraction _ Boys Club sings three
songs to taped music, including its top 10 hit ``I Remember Holding
You'' _ Universal Pictures, MCA Home Video and the studio tour all
receive exposure.
   MCA's video unit plugs the cassette for ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial'' while Universal Pictures displays posters for
the new Tom Hanks film, ``The 'Burbs.''
   ``I think the tour will help launch the Boys Club, and I think it
will help build awareness for the various MCA divisions among
consumers nationwide,'' said Brad Nye of Creative Entertainment
Marketing, a firm developing mall tours.
   Boys Club member Gene Hunt said that when the group was offered
the same promotion that made Tiffany a star, he said, ``I looked at
Tiffany and said, `Yeah! I'll go with no shoes!''
   MCA is not the only company using America's shopping centers for
national promotions.
   Mattel Toys has presented the ``Barbie's Imagination'' mall tour,
complete with a real-life Barbie. Nestle has sponsored ``The
Raisinettes Summer Sunsations Fashions Show.'' Polaroid used a mall
tour to generate renewed interest in instant photography for its
Spectra Camera. And Mountain Dew has presented a nationwide mall
tour highlighted by music videos.
   On March 31, Working Woman magazine, in cooperation with Jeep and
Goodyear, will open its own mall tour.
   ``We like to get out there and talk to our readers,'' said Andrea
Kaplan, the magazine's director of corporate communications. ``We
think this is a very interactive, visual way to give information to
women. I think it's very smart marketing.''
   The Working Woman tour, set for 22 cities, will feature a fashion
show, cooking classes, car displays, motivational speeches and
exercise tips. An estimated 2.7 million people will see the
presentations.
   ``Our vision is that you bring a page of the magazine to life,''
Kaplan said. ``It's almost like a mini women's World's Fair.''

<HEAD>Mother Charged With Forcing Children Into Prostitution</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother charged with forcing her
9-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter into prostitution with up to
80 adults may have found clients for them by advertising in
pornographic magazines, a prosecutor said.
   Katherine Ann Hubert, 29, of El Cerrito, who was arraigned
Thursday on 19 felony counts and was being held without bail, used
the money she collected for sex acts by her children to buy drugs,
officials said.
   Police were seeking the youngsters' grandmother, a 48-year-old
Concord woman who was not identified by authorities, on a warrant
charging her with pandering in the case.
   Hubert was arrested Tuesday after a guardian who has been caring
for the children told police they had been prostituted while the
family lived in Richmond in the San Francisco Bay area between 1986
and 1988, said police Lt. Ray Howard.
   The girl told investigators her mother forced her to have sex
with 60 men and the boy said he was forced to have sex with 20 women.
   ``We have reason to believe on some occasions there was physical
violence involved in some of these acts,'' Howard said.
   The children said Hubert gave them such drugs as cocaine,
methamphetamine, marijuana, sleeping pills and alcohol in an effort
to desensitize them to sex acts, Howard said.
   The children were removed from Hubert's care last May after an
allegation the girl had been molested.
   The mother is charged with 16 counts of forcing the children into
lewd and lascivious acts, two counts of pandering children for sex
and one count of supplying rock cocaine to her son.
   Hubert seemed nervous Thursday when she appeared before Bay
Municipal Judge Allen Norris, and said she could not afford to hire
an attorney. She was referred to the Public Defender's Office.
   The woman, who was being held at the Contra Costa County Jail in
Martinez, is scheduled to appear in court again Feb. 2.
   Hubert has no criminal record, according to Deputy District
Attorney Brandon Baum.
   Baum said he has prosecuted other child prostitution cases, but
said this case is unusual because of the ``business-like manner in
which the acts took place. ... It was not a haphazard type of
thing.''
   Hubert may have found clients by advertising in pornographic
magazines, he said.
   Baum said there were no signs the mother took any precautions to
protect her children's health or guard them from sexually
transmitted disease.
   The grandmother ``aided and abetted in making arrangements for
the acts to take place,'' Baum said. Most occurred at the family
home.
   ``There are still a lot of unanswered questions about the
grandmother ... her role here,'' Howard said.
   Officials believe the children's father was not involved in the
alleged prostitution and wasn't living with them at the time, the
lieutenant said.
   Shortly after the children were removed from their mother's care
last May, two other girls, ages 2 and 4, were taken from the home,
authorities said. Their relationship to Hubert was unclear.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze will travel to Pakistan next week for talks with the
country's leaders on a settlement of the Afghan problem, the
Pakistani government said today.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Shevardnadze would arrive in
Islamabad Feb. 4 for a day of talks with President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Foreign Minister Sahabzada
Yaqub Khan.
   According to a U.N. brokered agreement signed last April, all
remaining Soviet troops are to leave Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   The situation in Kabul, the Afghan capital, has been
deteriorating as the Soviet troops prepare for final withdrawal.
   Shevardnadze will be the highest ranking Soviet leader to visit
Pakistan in more than 20 years, since then-Soviet Prime Minister
Alexi Kosygin visited in the late 1960s.
   ``We hope our talks with the Soviet leader will pave the way for
a peaceful settlement, although the situation on the ground in
Afghanistan is depressing,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named
under government rules.
   Western diplomats reported Thursday that hundreds of civilians
were killed Monday in a major bombardment by Soviet and Afghan
forces on a tunnel on the highway connecting Kabul to the Soviet
Union.
   U.S.- and Pakistan-backed Afghan rebels had blocked the crucial
road for the last several days, causing severe shortages of food and
fuel in Kabul and other major Afghan cities.
   Responding to the deteriorating security situation, U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Thursday ordered the U.S.
Embassy in Kabul closed. Other Western embassies have advised their
nationals to leave Afghanistan immediately while commercial flights
are still operating.
   Senior Pakistani diplomats described the upcoming talks between
Shevardnadze and Pakistani leaders as ``crucial for preventing
further bloodshed in Afghanistan.''
   Direct talks earlier this month between Yuli Vorontsov, first
deputy Soviet foreign minister and ambassador to Kabul, and Pakistan
and Iran-based resistance groups deadlocked because the resistance
refused to include members of the present Marxist administration in
Kabul in a proposed consultative council that is to elect the future
interim government for Afghanistan.
   The resistance had insisted that only those officials of Afghan
leader Najib's administration who have not committed crimes against
the people during the 9-year civil war be included in the council.
   Vorontosov said the government should have the right to nominate
its representatives for the council.
   Pakistani officials said they hoped Shevardnadze would bring a
proposal to resolve the disagreement.
   ``Even a continuation of the deadlock will mean further bloodshed
when the Soviets leave Afghanistan,'' a senior Pakistani diplomat
said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine singing, dancing and spoon-snapping nuns have
landed cameo roles in the hit musical ``Nunsense,'' and some are
hoping to make a habit of it to help lighten up their image.
   ``Hopefully if people see us this way they won't feel that nuns
are like when you had them in school,'' said Sister Mary Brigid, a
Carmelite who will be playing wooden spoons to an Irish jig the week
of Feb. 28. ``When I had them in school, I was afraid to talk to
them.''
   The nuns passed a talent audition with flying habits earlier this
month and were chosen for guest appearances in the spoof of convent
life.
   ``Nunsense'' has played in 30 American cities since its 1985
debut. It is now in its third season in Boston, where it has been a
hit among clergy.
   ``It made me proud to be a sister and left me with a warm
feeling,'' said Sister Cheryl Donahue, 37, a Franciscan who will
sing in the show with another nun next month.
   ``I'm not an actress type and I'm kind of shy so I don't know how
I'm going to get through it, but it'll be fun,'' Sister Donahue said.
   Sister Rena Foley, who was a professional dancer before becoming
a nun, became the first performing nun on Tuesday. She began in a
formal habit, but then took it off to reveal a spangled outfit for a
jazz number. Sister Foley will keep center stage until Sunday.
   Five other winning acts each will perform a number at the start
of the second act for one week, starting Tuesday.
   The normal ``Nunsense'' cast is five habit-clad actresses who
sing, clown and tapdance. The off-beat story involves five nuns who
stage a talent show to raise money to bury four of their sisters,
who have died of botulism and are being stashed temporarily in the
convent freezer.
   The show's producers have pledged to donate $2 from each ticket
to charities chosen by the nuns.

<HEAD>Whipping Post Proposed for Drug Offenders in Delaware</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers in Delaware, which outlawed
public floggings less than 30 years ago, could be stripped to the
waist and given 40 lashes if legislation introduced in the state
Senate becomes law.
   The bill unveiled Thursday requires the whipping post in addition
to jail time for anyone convicted of dealing hard drugs or involving
children in the drug world.
   ``I think the drug problem is serious enough to warrant that kind
of punishment,'' said Senate Majority Leader Thomas Sharp, the
bill's sponsor. ``I'm willing to take the barbs and criticisms, but
we're going to debate it.''
   The Democrat said he has support for the proposal, and plans to
bring it to a floor debate after a six-week break for budget
hearings that began Thursday.
   Under the legislation, a drug offender could receive ``no fewer
than five nor more than 40 lashes well laid on'' a bare back.
   Asked if corporal punishment might be viewed as a violation of
the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, Sharp said
it shouldn't be in a society that permits executions.
   ``I don't know why beating them is any worse,'' he said.
   The legislation calls for whippings to take place at the Delaware
Correctional Center near Smyrna under the state corrections
commissioner's supervision.
   The commissioner did not return telephone calls Thursday, and the
governor's office had no comment on the bill.
   Sharp said the whipping post was used extensively in Delaware in
the 1930s and 1940s. Delaware was the last state to drop the
punishment, finally banning it in the mid-1960s.
   David Swayze, an attorney who helped develop new sentencing
guidelines that took effect in 1987, said bringing back the whipping
post was never considered.
   Swayze, who researched Delaware's whipping post while in college,
said the last person sentenced to a flogging was a car thief in 1957
or 1958. The sentence was never carried out.
   Most floggings were for theft, and the average sentence was 20 to
40 lashes, Swayze said. The whip was a leather strap with a
cat-o'-nine-tails, or leather prongs, at the end.
   Floggings were public, but ``it was a misdemeanor to take a
picture of it,'' Swayze said.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. trade group has offered to buy the
unfinished U.S. embassy building in Moscow, on which construction
was halted after it was found to be riddled with Soviet listening
devices.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Thursday the
government is studying the offer by the trade group headed by Dwayne
O. Andreas, one of the nation's richest men and chairman of Archer
Daniels Midland Co.
   No price has been discussed, Redman said, adding that Andreas had
only informally proposed the plan to buy the building, which was
being built by a Soviet construction company.
   ``It's only in channels in what we would call a very informal
way, in the sense that we have had a discussion through diplomatic
channels of this idea with the Soviets, but as I say, very
informally and inconclusively,'' Redman said.
   Last Oct. 27, then-President Reagan recommended that the building
be razed and rebuilt from the ground up.
   The United States had ``no choice,'' Reagan said at the time,
``because there's no way to rid it of the many listening devices
that we built into it.''
   The existence of bugs in the structure became widely known in
1986. Under the 1972 construction agreement, a Soviet
government-owned construction firm was permitted to build the
American embassy.
   For five months, a Soviet engineer worked with the American firm
that designed the structure, and large segments of it were assembled
off-site _ out of view of U.S. supervisors.
   The United States has filed claims against the Soviets for $29
million in connection with what the United States claims are defects
and delays in the construction. Those claims must be negotiated by
an arbitration panel in Stockholm, Sweden.
   Archer Daniels Midland is the world's largest processor of corn,
soybeans, wheat, peanuts and other farm products.
   Andreas is also co-chairman of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and
Economic Council, which has tried to promote more trade between the
two superpowers. He made the offer on behalf of a consortium of U.S.
companies, which would use the building as their Moscow headquarters.
   The Soviets would have to approve any sale because the building
was originally intended for use as a new American embassy in Moscow,
built under a 1972 agreement between the two countries.
   Also affected by the controversy is the new Soviet embassy in
Washington. The Soviets are barred from moving into the building
until Americans occupy the Moscow building.

<HEAD>Chun's Ex-Intelligence Chief Charged With Corruption</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan's
intelligence chief was charged with corruption today and taken to
prison after two days of questioning by criminal prosecutors,
officials said.
   Prosecutors said Chang Se-dong, ex-director of the Agency for
National Security Planning, formerly the Korean Central Intelligence
Agency, was charged with misusing official authority and other
offenses.
   The action came as part of government and parliamentary inquiries
into allegations of human rights abuses and corruption under the
authoritarian Chun government. Chang was the highest-ranking former
official of that government to be charged so far.
   The Agency for National Security Planning, the nation's main
foreign intelligence organization, played a major role in enforcing
Chun's tough rule and suppressing domestic opposition.
   Chang, an ex-general who was one of the most powerful men in the
nation under Chun, was whisked under guard to a prison outside Seoul
after formal warrants were issued. He had been held by prosecutors
since Wednesday for questioning.
   Prosecutors said Chang strongly denied any wrongdong, insisting
he merely followed presidential orders. He was head of Chun's
presidential security before serving as intelligence chief from 1985
to 1987.
   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980, is in rural
exile at a remote Buddhist monastery. He apologized to the nation in
November for abuses under his rule and went into exile.
   The former president has denied any personal wrongdoing, but some
of his relatives and aides have been convicted or charged with
corruption.
   The charges filed against Chang were vague and relatively mild.
They included illegal construction of a guest house and illegally
using government office space.
   Opposition groups have been demanding the arrest of Chang and
several other former top Chun aides on human rights abuses. South
Korean press reports said prosecutors had difficulty finding hard
evidence to use against Chang.
   The opposition contends President Roh Tae-woo's government is not
making a sufficient effort to prosecute former Chun aides. Roh, a
former general and once close ally of Chun, is closely identified
with the ex-president in the eyes of many South Koreans.
   The inquiry into the Chun regime has dominated South Korean
politics for months and hampered the government's efforts to achieve
broad acceptance.
   On Thursday, Chun refused to accept an order from a National
Assembly special committee to testify on his role in the bloody
suppression of a 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju in
which at least 200 people were killed.
   The opposition is trying to use the Kwangju incident and other
legacies of the authoritarian Chun government to weaken the Roh
government.
   Opposition parties demanded this week that Roh keep an election
promise to submit to a referendum on his rule. It is not clear if
Roh could win such a vote and he might be forced to hold elections
or step down if defeated.
   Chun stepped down last February at the end of a seven-year term
and was replaced by Roh.

   A moderate earthquake shook southwestern
Hungary today, crumbling chimneys and cracking walls but causing no
injuries, the official MTI news agency reported.
   The quake, which struck at 4:55 a.m. and lasted seven minutes,
registered 4.5 on the Richter scale, the report said. Experts said
they expected more tremors in the quake-prone area.
   Some 40 minor quakes have been registered in the region, about 94
miles southwest of Budapest, since 1953. None have registered above
6.5 on the Richter scale, MTI said.
   On Thursday, the same area was hit by another earthquake that
registered 3.4 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in
populated areas, and a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage.

   A farmer's $98,500 bid won him farmland once
owned by Abraham Lincoln and his father near the Lincoln Log Cabin
State Historic Site.
   Ron Best beat two other bidders Thursday at a foreclosure sale
held in Mattoon, about 60 miles southeast of Springfield. Best's
purchase will be used to retire a mortgage signed by Raymond W.
Phipps of Springfield in August 1975.
   The unpaid principal and interest totaled $91,079. That amount
will continue to increase at 9 percent until the sale is finalized
in six months.
   Best said the 125-acre site will be used ``for farming and
farming only.''
   The auction had an old-fashioned flavor as several volunteers who
work at the restored Lincoln Log Cabin nearby showed up in period
costumes. Though the character of Thomas Lincoln, who actually
farmed the land, was represented, Abe Lincoln was not.

<HEAD>Theologians Attack Pope's Stance On Birth Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic theologians from
universities across Europe have attacked Pope John Paul II for his
continued opposition to artificial birth control.
   The criticism prompted the television network ZDF to interrupt
its regular news program Thursday evening and broadcast an editorial
saying: ``The pope should be careful to keep too many Catholics from
walking out on him.''
   Meanwhile in Rome, Lithuania's visiting cardinal said Thursday
that Communist authorities in his Soviet republic would welcome a
visit to the Catholic stronghold by the pope but Moscow continues to
oppose the idea.
   The theologians' German-language declaration complained that the
pope has linked the church's teachings on birth control too closely
to fundamental articles of faith such as the holiness of God.
   It said the link was made so strong that those who criticize the
church's ban on artificial birth control are accused of ``attacking
the fundamental pillars of Christian teaching.''
   The 170 university theology professors who signed the declaration
contended the 1968 Vatican encyclical regarding birth control did
not place an absolute ban on artificial forms of contraception.
   At the Vatican, spokesman Joaquin Navarro said: ``I think we are
talking of a local matter.''
   ``I can also say that some people who signed have withdrawn their
support of the document,'' he added, without providing names.
   The signers of the seven-page document, called the Cologne
Declaration, are from West Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and
Switzerland.
   The statement also focused on the pope's teachings, on disputes
over permission to teach Catholic theology and recent on nominations
to fill bishops' positions.
   ``We are witnesses of a theologically very questionable attempt
to overstep the papal jurisdictional and teaching competence, and to
make it unacceptably prevailing,'' it said.
   It was prompted in part by the pope's appointment last month of
Cardinal Joachim Meisner as archbishop of Cologne, one of the most
influential church posts in Europe. Some local church officials
thought Meisner too conservative.
   Hours after the document was released, West German bishops issued
a statement saying: ``The West German bishops conference decisively
rejects the numerous misrepresentations against Pope John Paul II.''
   Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius, in Rome for talks with the pope,
said he raised the issue of a papal visit to Lithuania in a meeting
this week in Moscow with Sergei Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet
department on Catholic affairs.
   ``At this time, the government of Moscow is very much against a
visit of the pope,'' Sladkevicius said.
   Sladkevicius said that Lithuania's Communist Party chief,
Algirdas Brazauskas, had indicated the local government favored a
papal visit.
   The cardinal said the Lithuanian government is ``still very
dependent on Moscow'' and could not clear the way for a papal visit
on its own.
   The Polish-born pontiff frequently has expressed the desire to
travel to the Soviet Union but insisted he would go only if
permitted to visit his flock nationwide.
   He has said that he has been refused permission at least twice to
visit Lithuania.
   Lithuania, an independent country before World War II, was
occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and has been viewed as a
stronghold of nationalism. Sladkevicius said about 80 percent of
Lithuania's 3.5 million people are Roman Catholics.

<HEAD>Noriega Keeps Opposition Media Closed As Campaign Opens</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's opposition news media remain
shuttered nearly a year after being closed by Gen. Manuel Noriega,
and with a presidential campaign about to start, there is little
likelihood they will be allowed to reopen.
   The most important opposition newspaper, La Prensa, had a
circulation of 50,000 when Noriega's soldiers stopped its presses
last Feb. 25 and closed its doors.
   ``Even if they allowed us to reopen next month, we do not know if
we could start publishing right away,'' said Winston Robles,
director of the newspaper when it closed.
   ``There will be many technical problems,'' he said. ``We have not
been allowed to go inside the newspaper building since it was shut
down.''
   Also shut were the newspapers El Siglo, La Extra and Quiubo; the
radio stations Continente and Mundial; and Channel 5, a television
station owned by ousted president Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   All were charged with violating a press law protecting the
security of the state. An investigation is still going on and some
reporters were called in to testify last month.
   ``We are going to demand that the news media be allowed to
reopen,'' said Guillermo Ford, candidate for second vice president
on the united opposition ticket led by Guillermo Endara of the
Arnulfista Party and Ricardo Arias Calderon, candidate for the first
vice presidency.
   The presidential elections are scheduled for May 7; the
government is expected to name a candidate soon.
   The Interior Ministry said the issue of reopening the opposition
media is in the hands of the legal department. Other sources
referred all queries to the district attorney's office, which
declined to discuss the matter.
   Other media have to be very careful about what is put on the air
or published, including the independent newspaper La Estrella owned
by the Duque family, whose members have varied political leanings.
   A government decree establishes that television and radio
franchises can be canceled if the stations ``incite to the
disruption of public order, civil disobedience and the overthrow of
the state.'' Radio and television stations air the decree before and
after their news programs.
   In a speech Jan. 17, Noriega, commander of the Panama Defense
Forces and the country's de facto ruler, equated Panama's situation
to that of Nicaragua after the government there closed down an
opposition newspaper.
   He quoted approvingly an observation on censorship by the
Nicaraguan government that ended, ``the nation is at war, under
siege by the United States and by regional oligarchies.''
   The full text of the speech appeared across the top of page 1 in
La Estrella; in the text the quoted observation appeared in capital
letters.
   Noriega has survived more than a year of U.S. attempts to oust
him following an indictment in Florida on drug-related charges.
   When Delvalle tried to fire him, Noriega used his clout to have
Panama's congress dump Delvalle and install Manuel Solis Palma as
president.
   U.S. sanctions have compounded an economic crisis, but Noriega
has broken a general strike, crushed public demonstrations and
presented himself as the defender of Panamanian sovereignty,
claiming the United States wants him out so it can renege on the
Panama Canal treaties that call for U.S. forces to leave in the year
2000.
   Government candidates have the pages of three government-owned
newspapers at their disposal as well as time on a state-owned radio
and television station.
   Most of the newsprint held by La Prensa has been sold to La
Estrella to keep it from wasting in hot and humid Panama.
   ``If we are allowed to reopen, I am sure they would close us down
again within days,'' said Ruben Dario Carles, president of La
Prensa's board of directors. He was referring to past occasions when
the newspaper was closed down by the government.
   Robles and others, including news editor Alfredo (Wilfy) Jimenez
and reporters Migdalia Fuentes and Flor Quintero, were called by the
district attorney's office in December to testify.
   ``We were questioned about stories in which opposition leaders
criticized the government. The government claims by publishing the
stories, we were agreeing with them,'' Jimenez said.
   Jimenez and others tried to open a small daily late last year,
but approval for the publication is pending.
   ``The government must certify that each reporter is a bona fide
journalist,'' Jimenez said. ``Now the permits by the Board of Health
and other agencies such as the Commerce Ministry must also be
confirmed by the Interior Ministry.''
   ``We do not think the conditions exist for free elections without
opposition news media,'' Robles said.

   Authorities who initially suggested foul
play caused the simultaneous deaths of three of four quadruplets say
they're halting their investigation with few leads, and the
fatalities remain a mystery.
   Exhaustive medical tests failed to find a reason for the deaths
two weeks ago of 3-month-old Kia, Mia and DeAnthony Walker in this
Atlanta suburb, Clayton County Medical Examiner Joseph Burton said
Thursday.
   ``I'm not telling you it's a matter of black and white; it's
not,'' Burton said. ``The scales just tip away from the direction of
foul play at this time.''
   Police Maj. L. Dwayne Hobbs said the deaths remain suspicious and
the case will remain open, but inactive, unless new evidence turns
up.
   Burton said the cause would be listed as sudden unexplained death
in infancy, but he probably always will have ``haunting suspicions''
about the case. Such an occurrence is unheard of in medical circles,
the medical examiner said.
   The two girls and a boy were found dead early Jan. 13 when their
mother, Tonja L. Walker, checked her babies, who had been sleeping
together in a crib. The only child alive was DeAndrea.
   Doctors initially suspected meningitis as the cause of death, but
autopsies ruled that out, Burton said.
   There were no signs of strangulation or suffocation, he said.
   ``We tested for sedatives, tranquilizers, pesticides, arsenic,
strychnine, cocaine, marijuana, the whole shooting match,'' Burton
said. ``We tested blood, tissues, stomach contents.''
   Two infants had respiratory infections, Burton said. Experts
examining the base of one infant's brain found an unusual change in
a brain cell. That part of the brain controls breathing.
   The deaths fit the pattern of sudden infant death syndrome, an
unexplained illness that most often affects children less than a
year old, said Dr. Diane Rowley, an infant mortality epidemiologist
at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Infants 3 to 4 months
old are at the highest risk.
   The majority of such deaths occur between late November and
April, Ms. Rowley said. ``There's some question as to whether
something about the cold weather or infections contribute to the
deaths, but that really has not been solved.''
   Some researchers believe siblings are prone to the syndrome, and
studies have documented cases in which twins or siblings born in
separate births have died of it, Ms. Rowley said.
   However, she said the Walker case ``is very rare.''
   ``We're going to write the case up,'' Burton said. ``It'll be
submitted to various forensic pathology journals. When this occurs
again, and it will somewhere, it will let someone know that it's
happened before.''
   The tragedy was not the first to strike Mrs. Walker. In 1985,
prematurely born twins died in a hospital, police said.
   The Walker family is trying to cope with the infant's deaths and
the subsequent investigation, said Tonja Walker's mother, Mary
Walker.
   ``Police said `foul play.' They didn't say who (was the
suspect),'' Mary Walker said. ``The suspicion was on her (Tonja
Walker) as well.''
   She defended her daughter as a good mother who ``couldn't hurt a
fly.''
   ``Does he look like he's neglected?'' she said, holding DeAndrea
in the hallway of the Forest Park Police Department.
   She said the investigation would ``be with us forever. It's
something we'll always have to try to live down.''

<HEAD>Report: Lump Of Ice Might Have Smashed Engine Of Crashed Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aircraft specialists trying to find the cause of
the Boeing 737 crash in central England say a lump of ice may have
smashed the main fan of one of the engines, The Times of London
reported today.
   The Jan. 8 crash near the village of Kegworth killed 46 people,
including a woman who died of her injuries Thursday.
   The paper, however, said detailed analysis of the British Midland
Airways plane's two engines by engineers from the French company
SNECMA have not produced any conclusive cause for the breakup of the
plane's left engine.
   SNECMA builds the CFM-56 engines with General Electric Co. The
engines of the jet are being examined at the headquarters of SNECMA
at Villaroche near Paris.
   ``Investigators are relying on two theories, that it was damaged
after being struck by a foreign body, possibly ice from the waste
pipe of the forward lavatory, or that the blades suffered metal
fatigue,'' the report said.
   ``The engineers have found nothing wrong with the jet's right
engine and no evidence to explain why the crew shut it down,'' it
said.
   The crew shut down the right engine of the plane while the left
engine caught fire. News reports have said investigators are
examining the possibility of faulty electronics.
   The report said detailed metallurgical tests are being carried
out on every piece of recovered wreckage from the left engine but
that work is being hampered because many of the engine's fan blades
are still missing.
   ``Those that have been found are badly damaged, presenting a
major problem for the metallurgists trying to establish which of
them caused the crash and how,'' it said.

<HEAD>Swedish Study Finds Laughter Is Good Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medieval physicians believed health was the
balance of mysterious fluids called ``humors,'' and a Swedish
physician has some new evidence that humor, in its modern sense, is
also a healer.
   Dr. Lars Ljungdahl of the Lyckorna Primary Health-Care Centre in
Motala, Sweden, reports that six women got significant relief from
painful symptoms of muscle-bone disorders and depression with a
course of ``humor therapy.''
   Laughter corresponded with relief from symptoms, and the greatest
symptomatic relief occurred in people who had greatest degrees of
amusement, Ljungdahl said in a letter in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Ljungdahl said one male and two female nurses participated in 13
meetings of a ``humor group'' with the patients, ages 26 to 48.
   ``We used funny books, records, and videofilms and learned to
give higher priority to humor in our everyday lives,'' he wrote.
``The program also involved lectures on humor research and the
regular use of relaxation programs, with suggestions that stimulated
humor and joy.''
   He noted that relief was significantly greater during weeks seven
through 13 than during weeks one through six, indicating regular
laughter had the greatest benefits.
   Degrees of amusement and relief were graded by the patients on
separate scales, he said.
   Independent psychological tests before and after humor therapy
revealed an overall improvement in general psychological well-being,
he said.
   ``The study suggests that a humor therapy program can increase
the quality of life for patients with chronic problems and that
laughter has an immediate symptom-relieving effect for these
patients,'' Ljungdahl wrote.
   ``Their self-confidence also seemed to increase, they coped more
ably with their symptoms and allowed theselves to be happy and enjoy
life regardless of their medical problems,'' he said.
   Ljungdahl acknowledged that his study results were only
preliminary _ because of the small number of patients involved, the
lack of a comparison group of healthy patients and the uncertainty
of measurements.
   Such studies are now under way, both in the United States and in
Great Britain, said Dr. William F. Fry, an associate clinical
professor in psychiatry at Stanford University Medical School in
Stanford, Calif.
   Meanwhile, Ljungdahl's finding ``is consistent with everything we
know in terms of physical effects of engagement in mirth, the
emotion, laughter smiling, chuckling and so on,'' Fry said in a
telephone interview Thursday.
   ``These behaviors are involved in (and) impact on most of the
physiological systems of the body,'' added Fry. ``This we know
through direct laboratory evidence.''
   Fry maintains that laughter exercises muscles and massages organs
in a healthy way, forces stale air out of the lungs and allows
oxygen in, and increases the level of the pain-killing chemicals the
brain itself produces.
   ``The medical profession is coming around more and more to a
realization of the values of humor and the positive emotions in
general. I've seen, in the last 10 years, quite a strong change in
the attitudes of doctors,'' he said.
   Norman Cousins, a former magazine editor whose 1979 book,
``Anatomy of an Illness,'' chronicled his comeback from a
potentially debilitating disease with the help of humor, said he was
pleased by Ljungdahl's findings.
   ``Just as you know you need food to live, you need humor in your
life to live,'' he said in a telephone interview from the University
of California at Los Angeles Medical School, where he is now a
professor of medical humanities.
   ``Humor must not be an accident,'' Cousins said. ``It must be a
constant force in your life.''

<TEXT>
   Criticized by the press for taking too many
holidays, the Duchess of York will spend five days next week at a
French ski resort on official duties, Buckingham Palace said today.
   The palace said the duchess, who is married to Prince Andrew,
will visit Megeve in the French Alps for the Combined Services
Winter Sports Association championships.
   ``This is not a holiday, but an official working engagement,'' a
palace spokesman said.
   He said Sarah, better known as ``Fergie,'' would not ski
privately but may take part in a dual slalom run on the final day of
competition.
   During their ski trip in the Swiss resort of Klosters in
mid-January, Andrew and Sarah were criticized by British tabloids
for being ``no-work royals'' and taking too many vacations.
   Buckingham Palace defended the royal couple, saying Sarah had a
baby last year and Andrew does not take on too many duties other
than his navy service with the HMS Edinburgh.
   The palace also said that in July the couple will make a 12-day
visit to Canada, where they will visit Prince Edward Island, Quebec,
Saskatchewan and Ottawa.

   Japan has decided to close its embassy in
Afghanistan and withdraw its diplomatic personnel because of
increasing tension in that country, the Foreign Ministry said today.
   The move follows a decision Thursday by the United States to
close its embassy in the Afghan capital of Kabul because of concern
over increased strife in the country as Soviet troops complete their
withdrawal.
   ``Because the situation in Afghanistan has become tense and
conditions in Kabul are likely to worsen, we have decided to
temporarily close the Japanese Embassy in Afghanistan and withdraw
the embassy staff from the country,'' the ministry said in a
statement.
   The three embassy personnel stationed in Kabul, including the
acting ambassador, would return to Japan at an undecided date, a
ministry spokesman said.
   The embassy has also confirmed the presence in Afghanistan of 13
non-diplomat Japanese who are in the country temporarily, and all
plan to leave as well, the spokesman said.
   The Soviet Union has pledged to withdraw its remaining troops
from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. The Soviet troops entered Afghanistan
in December 1979 to support the Marxist Afghan government in its
battle against Afghan guerrillas, backed by the United States and
Pakistan.
   The guerrillas have vowed to defeat the government following the
withdrawal of the Soviet troops.
   Japan has pledged $60 million in aid for an estimated 5 million
Afghan refugees who have fled from their homeland because of the
fighting.

<HEAD>Report: Anti-Semitic Acts Reach Five-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish group suggested a rise in anti-Semitic
incidents last year could be attributed in part to developments in
the Middle East, the emergence of neo-Nazi skinheads, and the 50th
anniversary of Kristallnacht.
   A report released Thursday by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith said 1,281 anti-Semitic incidents were reported in the United
States and Puerto Rico in 1988, with vandalism up 19 percent and
harassment up 41 percent over 1987. The 1987 total was 1,018.
   Last year's figure was the highest of any of the past five years.
The number of incidents reached 1,422 in 1982, the highest in the 10
years the group has compiled the audit from reports by its regional
offices and law enforcement officials.
   Among the incidents cited in the survey were the spray-painting
of anti-Semitic and racist slogans at a Jewish high school in
Doraville, Ga.; the explosion of a pipe bomb on the grounds of a
Florida synagogue; and the arson of a synagogue in the New York City.
   Also mentioned in the report were desecrations of Jewish
cemeteries and 54 anti-Semitic incidents on 38 college campuses,
which included vandalism, threats, harassment and assault.
   The report cited a November attack against a Jewish university
student in New York City as being among the most brutal assaults. A
gang of youths allegedly shouted anti-Semitic epithets as they beat,
robbed and stabbed the 19-year-old, who survived.
   ``Isn't it ironic that in our lifetime we've conquered space and
even eradicated smallpox yet we have not developed a vaccine against
the virus of hate,'' said Abraham Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League.
   There were 117 incidents linked to Palestinian unrest in Israel's
West Bank and Gaza region. Foxman said he believes anti-Semites used
the situation to carry out acts of hatred ``under the guise of a
political conflict.''
   Another 41 incidents were linked to the rise of so-called
skinheads.
   The skinhead subculture emerged in London as early as the 1960s.
But segments of the movement took on Nazi overtones in 1985 and
since have been supported by and associated with white supremacist
groups.
   The league said more than 60 anti-Semitic incidents were sparked
by the observance of the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the
night of violence against Jews in Germany and Austria that many
believe marked the beginning of the Holocaust.
   New York led the nation with 208 incidents, half of those in New
York City. California had 121, Florida 89 and New Jersey 67. There
were no incidents reported in 10 states.
   According to the survey, 124 people were arrested for
anti-Semitic acts in 1988, approximately 90 percent of whom were
under 21.
   It was a record year for harassment incidents against Jewish
institutions in the 10 years the survey has been taken. The group
reported 133 such cases, up about 10 percent from previous years.

   Bill Walsh has resigned as coach of the
San Francisco 49ers after leading the National Football League team
to its third Super Bowl championship this decade.
   Walsh, 59, will stay on with the team as executive vice president

   ``It's an uplift to me to step aside on a most positive note,''
Walsh said Thursday at a news conference to announce his resignation
Wednesday. ``This is the way most coaches would like to leave the

   The 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals 20-16 in Miami on Sunday to

   Walsh, who has an overall record of 102-63-1, including playoff
games, joined the 49ers in 1979 after two years as head coach at
Stanford University.

<HEAD>`Black and Blue,' A Musical Revue, Opens On Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs with other reviews. No PMs planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   You would think that in this barren Broadway
season, just about any song and dance celebration sporting music by
Ellington, Arlen, Armstrong, Handy and others would lift the spirits.
   But for much of the time, that's not the case with ``Black and
Blue,'' the new musical revue that opened Thursday at Broadway's
Minskoff Theater. It's an uneven production that contains flashes of
sass and expert tap dancing but too often settles for the routine.
   Responsibility for that predictability lies with Claudio Segovia
and Hector Orezzoli who are credited in the program with conceiving
and directing this new revue. The duo, creators of the hit ``Tango
Argentino,'' have staged ``Black and Blue'' with surprisingly little
style, something their earlier show had in abundance.
   The musical attempts to recreate the sizzle and snap of the
Cotton Club and Apollo revues that galvanized Harlem audiences in
1920s, '30s and '40s. ``Black and Blue'' might work better in a
nightclub setting. In the cavernous Minskoff, the lack of production
values are apparent, as is the perfunctory quality of Henry LeTang's
ensemble choreography which seems more Las Vegas glitz than Uptown
swagger.
   Excitement is confined mainly to a small group of terrific tap
dancers, mostly in solos, duets and trios. The tappers include such
veterans as Bunny Briggs, Jimmy Slyde, Ralph Brown and Lon Chaney as
well as a talented young hoofer named Savion Glover.
   Briggs, a little man with saucer eyes and an impish smile,
infuses his tap routines with a delicacy that is astonishing. He
embraces Ellington's ``In a Sentimental Mood,'' treating the song as
if it were a partner, and creates a joyousness that is hard to
resist.
   Slyde gets similar results with ``Stompin' at the Savoy,'' but
his style is smoother, slicker, more like a Fred Astaire routine.
And how many dancers can skate across the stage in taps?
   The best number in the show is another Ellington ditty, ``East
St. Louis Toodle-oo,'' with Brown and Chaney, two elder statesman of
tap, showing that age hasn't diminished their love of dance.
   Most of the singing falls to three formidable ladies _ Ruth
Brown, Linda Hopkins and Carrie Smith. Each of these women has her
moment, a showcase to strut her stuff, but often their talents are
not used to best advantage.
   Miss Brown tears up the place in ``St. Louis Blues'' and the
raunchy ``If I Can't Sell It, I'll Keep Sittin' on It,'' but then
seems uneasy in an overly contrived version of ``Body and Soul.''
   Miss Smith, with the deepest voice this side of Vaughan Monroe,
shines through two ill-conceived production numbers, one to ``I've
Got the Right to Sing the Blues.'' It places her on a huge silver
orb that rolls out on stage and then tilts backwards, subjecting the
audience to a bad case of vertigo. The second, ``Am I Blue,'' has
her perched on a swing high above the stage while the long train of
her dress billows to the floor.
   Miss Hopkins may have the most forceful of the three voices, but
she tends to diminish its power by going for the easy laugh and cute
gesture or phrasing. That cuteness mars songs such as ``Cry Like a
Baby,'' a raucous Big Maybelle Smith number.
   Segovia and Orezzoli also created the scenery, costumes and
lighting. Their settings are minimal, mostly curtains in various
shades of red, yellow, blue and gray, but they serve as backdrops
for the team's striking lighting designs.
   The lighting allows for the performers' shadows, sometimes
reaching to proscenium, to hover over the stage, or to be splashed
on the side walls of the theater. These dancing shadows spark ``I'm
Confessin' That I Love You,'' the one ensemble number that really
utilizes the performers, the stage and the production design.
   The fine orchestra, conducted by Leonard Oxley, is composed of
expert musicians, including Sir Roland Hanna as its principal piano
soloist.
   The best of the recent black musical revues _ the original
``Ain't Misbehavin''' and the off-Broadway hit ``One Mo' Time,'' for
example _ harnessed an energy that built throughout the entire
evening. ``Black and Bllue'' scatters its resources and could end
after just about any number in the second act. There's no emotional
payoff. Instead, you have to wait patiently for those marvelous tap
dancers to come on stage and take over the place.
   In other reviews:
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News said the show ``is in a class by
itself.'' `` `Black and Blue' is closer in spirit to other eras,''
he wrote. ``If you listen ... you hear a dignity, an elegance, a
worldliness that stands in great contrast to the aggressiveness and
desperation that underlie so much of our pop music.''
   In the New York Post, Clive Barnes called the show, ``downright
terrific. ... It has passion, finesse, fun and, above all, style.''
   But Frank Rich in The New York Times said the show was ``a weird,
at times diverting, crosscultural mishmash.''
   ``While bursting with talent worthy of the Cotton Club or the
Apollo or Birdland, `Black and Blue' looks like the bloated
nightclub floor shows that used to flourish in decadent Latin
American capitals just before dictatorships collapsed.''

   H. Claude Hudson, a national director of the
NAACP and longtime civil rights activist who once was jailed for his
efforts to end segregation, has died at age 102.
   Hudson, a dentist for 58 years, had been hospitalized since
Saturday with pneumonia. He died Thursday.
   Since 1953, he served on the national board of directors of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and had
devoted his life to ensuring equality for all people, friends said.
   ``He was one of our great freedom fighters,'' said Jose DeSosa,
state chairman of the NAACP. ``Dr. H. Claude Hudson has left his
footprints in the sand throughout the United States in his effort
and involvement in the NAACP.''
   Hudson was born April 19, 1886, the son of sharecropper parents
in Marksville, La., and came to Los Angeles in 1923, reportedly at
the urging of Louisiana law enforcement who felt he stirred up too
much trouble while president of the Shreveport, La., chapter of the
NAACP.
   ``At that time, being a member of the NAACP was tantamount to
being a member of the suicide club,'' said family spokeswoman Gisele
Hudson.
   He graduated from Wiley College in Texas, and from Howard
University Dental School in Washington, D.C. In 1931, he became the
first black to receive a law degree from Loyola University School of
Law, Mrs. Hudson said.
   It was at Howard that he developed a longstanding involvement
with the NAACP, which held its first convention at the university.
   While head of the Los Angeles NAACP chapter, Hudson was involved
in efforts to end segregation on county beaches. He and seven other
NAACP leaders briefly were jailed in 1925 after wading into the
ocean to test the policy at Manhattan Beach.
   They were fined $500 for violating the no-swimming ordinance
applying to blacks, but the case later was thrown out by the courts,
and the segregation policy abandoned, Mrs. Hudson said.
   He is survived by his wife, Lena, four children, and five
grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Feb. 2 in Los Angeles.

   Soviet and Afghan forces shelled a
mountain tunnel on the highway connecting Kabul to the Soviet Union,
then wiped out villages to the south, killing hundreds of civilians,
Western diplomats said.
   As tensions escalated during the last phases of the Soviet troop
withdrawal, Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Thursday
ordered the U.S. Embassy in Kabul closed, citing increased turmoil
in the Afghan capital.
   Japan today also ordered its embassy closed in Kabul and its
diplomatic personnel to leave the country because of deteriorating
conditions.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad quoted reports from Kabul that
Soviet and Afghan forces had launched a major shelling attack on
both ends of the 10-mile Salang Tunnel in an effort to reopen the
crucial Salang Highway, which is carrying Red Army troops home from
Afghanistan.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted
witnesses as calling the attack a ``major atrocity.''
   A dispatch from Kabul received by one Western embassy quoted
reports of witnesses seeing ``Soviet tanks rolling over dead bodies
of victims'' along the highway, which runs for 250 miles between
Kabul and the Soviet border.
   The tunnel, part of the highway, cuts through the Hindu Kush
mountains about 60 miles north of the capital.
   ``After shelling the north and south ends of the Salang tunnel,
Soviet and Afghan artillery obliterated all dwellings and villages
south of the tunnel,'' the diplomats quoted the reports as saying.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said,
``There are eyewitnesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds of
civilians were killed.''
   The dispatch received by the Western embassy said the report of
all houses being destroyed came from three separate sources,
including a diplomat who defends the Afghan government.
   Afghan media and military officers had reported 377 guerrillas
were killed Tuesday along the Salang Highway, where the insurgents
fighting the Kabul government have attacked many food and fuel
convoys trying to reach the capital.
   Heavy snows also have blocked parts of the road, and Kabul has
suffered severe food and fuel shortages as the end of the Soviet
military withdrawal approaches.
   Moslem guerrillas, backed by the United States and Pakistan, have
fought tha Kabul government since a Communist coup in April 1978.
Soviet troops intevened in 1979 to fight the rebels. Last May, the
Red Army began withdrawing under a U.N.-mediated agreement and all
Soviet military forces are to be gone by Feb. 15.
   The diplomats attributed the brutal Soviet and Afghan attack
Monday to a desire to intimidate Ahmed Shah Masoud, generally
considered the most effective guerrilla commander in Afghanistan.
   Masoud controls the Panjshir Valley, through which the Salang
Highway runs.
   In Islamabad, the Pakistani government said today that Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would arrive next week for
talks on a settlement in Afghanistan.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Shevardnadze would meet Feb. 4
with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan. There was no immediate
confirmation from Moscow.
   Shevardnadze would be the highest ranking Soviet leader to visit
Pakistan in more than 20 years.
   In another development Thursday, the army tried to counter
charges it has dragged young men from their homes to fight Afghan
guerrillas by displaying what it said were volunteers _ solemn
teen-agers and men in their late 30s.
   As the Soviet military withdraws, Afghanistan's conscript army
desperately needs recruits. Although two years of army service is
mandatory, thousands of Afghans have deserted. Many young men have
fled the country either to avoid conscription or to join the
insurgents.
   Baker's decision to shut down the Kabul embassy came on his first
day at his new job.
   The U.S. diplomatic contingent in Kabul already had been reduced
to less than 10 officers and security guards. An official source in
Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pullout
would be carried out over several days.
   A growing list of countries are debating whether to do the same.
On Saturday, the West German Embassy became the first foreign
embassy to close.
   Besides the diplomatic group, fewer than 20 private U.S. citizens
remain in Afghanistan. Most Westerners are with the International
Aid Mission, a charitable organization that has operated in
Afghanistan for many years.
   The U.S. Embassy said Tuesday it sent a warning letter to
Americans that ``a critical point'' had come in the Kabul area,
increased instablity was likely, and they should leave while
commercial flights remained available.
   Only the Soviet airline Aeroflot and Ariana, the Afghan
government airline, still operate from Kabul. Aeroflot uses military
planes and Ariana flights are unpredictable, sometimes delayed or
canceled for lack of fuel.

   Two people have been charged in the
kidnap-slaying of a warehouse supervisor who police say was abducted
at gunpoint by a former co-worker and shot to death despite the
$25,000 ransom paid by his wife.
   John Martini, 58, and Therese Afdahl, 30, were arrested late
Wednesday after they were spotted by police in nearby Fort Lee.
Martini is also wanted in Arizona where he is charged in the deaths
of two people last November.
   After picking up the ransom Tuesday night, Martini managed to
elude authorities who staked out the drop-off site, officials said.
   Martini and Ms. Afdahl were charged Thursday in the slaying of
Irving Flax, 58, who authorities say worked with Martini as a truck
driver about 20 years ago. Prosecutors say there may be more arrests.
   Martini, who is from Arizona, and Afdahl, a former resident of
Fairview, admitted the crime Thursday, according to today's editions
of the Star-Ledger of Newark.
   ``(Martini) has given a full sworn statement indicating he did
abduct Mr. Flax, hold him for ransom and shoot Mr. Flax three times
in the head, killing him,'' Dennis Calo, assistant prosecutor in
Bergen County, told the newspaper.
   Flax's body was found Tuesday morning in his car in a shopping
mall parking lot in Paramus.
   FBI agents trailing the kidnapper, who had picked up the ransom
in Flax's car, lost track of the auto after it crossed the Hudson
River into New York City.
   John C. McGinley, special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark
bureau, told a news conference that heavy traffic helped the driver
get away.
   ``There was a lot of evasive driving before we lost him,''
McGinley said. ``It looked as though he was looking for any signs of
our surveillance.''
   On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Charles R. DiGisi in Hackensack
ordered Martini held without bail because of the Arizona murder
warrant. Ms. Afdahl was ordered held on $500,000 cash bail.
   Bergen County Prosector John Holl said Martini turned up on
Flax's doorstep in Fair Lawn on Monday morning, and invited him to
go for a cup of coffee.
   The two got into Flax's car, where Martini pulled a gun, forcing
Flax into a rented car driven by Ms. Afdahl, Holl said.
   Holl said Flax was taken to an apartment rented by Martini and
Ms. Afdahl. Telephone calls were then made to Flax's wife,
instructing her to drop off the ransom at a restaurant parking lot.
The prosecutor refused to say how the details of the abduction were
obtained.
   Martini used Flax's car when he picked up the ransom and fled,
authorities said. Martini returned to the apartment and forced Flax
to drive his own car to the shopping mall, where Flax was fatally
shot about 11:30 p.m., Holl said.
   An anonymous tipster told police Martini was in New Jersey.
   Martini and Ms. Afdahl were arrested as they got into a taxi cab
carrying a duffel bag. Inside the bag, police found a .32-caliber
handgun and $29,000, including about $25,000 with serial numbers
matching the ransom money, Holl said.

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat met today with three
European foreign ministers in his first official contact with the
Common Market, whose support he is seeking for an international
peace conference on the Middle East.
   The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization arrived in the
Spanish capital late Thursday from Iraq and went directly to a
four-hour working dinner with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   Neither made a statement following the meeting, but a Spanish
government spokesman said both men considered 1989 ``a very
important year'' in the search for peace in the Middle East.
   On Thursday, a senior PLO official said in Baghdad that Arafat
would urge the Spanish, French and Greek foreign ministers to
recognize the symbolic state of Palestine that was proclaimed Nov.
15 during a meeting of Palestinian leaders in Tunisia.
   Israel balks at the idea of an international peace conference
that would include countries not directly involved in the conflict
and refuses to recognize the PLO as an valid representative of the
Palestinian people.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir let Foreign Minister
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez know during the Spanish official's trip
to Jerusalem earlier this month that Israel felt the EEC had no
business getting involved in a Middle East peace conference.
   Since an uprising against Israeli military presence in the
occupied territories began 13 months ago, 369 Palestinians and 15
Israelis have been killed.
   Fernandez Ordonez said the meeting between Arafat and the three
European leaders was being held ``to comply with a mandate by the
EEC Council of Foreign Ministers, which decided we should initiate
diplomatic action with the parties implicated in the Middle East
problem to promote the peace process.''
   During Spain's current six-month presidency of the Common Market,
Fernandez Ordonez heads the group's foreign ministers.
   The other two members of the EEC trio are Greek Foreign Minister
Carolos Papoulias and French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. Greece
chaired the EEC for the final half of last year, and France will
take over for six months in July.
   The PLO leader was to have an audience with King Juan Carlos
later today and to hold a news conference before departing.

   A winter storm was moving through the Southwest today, where snow
advisories were posted in Arizona and New Mexico, and the
rain-drenched East Coast was to dry up a little.
   Rain, mountain snow and a few thunderstorms developed over
portions of Arizona late Thursday and were spreading slowly eastward.
   A snow advisory was in effect for the eastern mountains of
Arizona, and a winter storm watch was posted today for the central
highlands of New Mexico.
   Light rain fell along portions of the East Coast from the
Carolinas to southern New England on Thursday night, and scattered
light rain also developed in the Pacific Northwest as a cold front
approached.
   Scattered light snow or drizzle fell early this morning over
portions of Pennsylvania and central New York.
   The rest of the nation had generally clear skies, but strong
winds continued along the eastern slopes of the Rockies, where a
high wind warning remained in effect. Winds were to peak at 75 mph
in some areas.
   Temperatures this morning were in the upper 20s in the northern
Great Lakes. Readings across Minnesota were expected to slowly rise
through the nighttime hours. Temperatures were well below zero in
portions of the Rockies.
   Today's forecast called for showers and some thunderstorms over
much of Texas and southern Louisiana; southeast Arizona and much of
New Mexico, with snow over higher elevations. Rain was to be
scattered over northeast Florida, the Georgia coast and the northern
Pacific Coast. Snow was expected across northern New England, and
winds were expected to be strong and gusty along the eastern slope
of the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were predicted in the teens and 20s in northern
Maine. Temperatures in the 30s and 40s were expected in the Pacific
Northwest; much of the Rockies; the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles;
eastern Montana; the upper Mississippi Valley; Iowa; the Great
Lakes; much of the Ohio Valley and the Atlantic Coast.
   Highs were to reach the 70s in portions of California, and into
the 80s over the central and southern Florida peninsula. The
remainder of the nation was to have highs in the 50s and 60s.

<HEAD>Contractor: Little Remedy to Leaks At Nuclear Reservation</HEAD>

   Little can be done to prevent highly
radioactive nuclear waste from leaking out of storage tanks on the
Hanford nuclear reservation, a federal contractor says.
   ``They deteriorate and wear out,'' said Bill Klink, a spokesman
for Westinghouse Hanford Co., referring to the storage tanks his
company is responsible for handling. ``It's not due to lack of
monitoring.''
   U.S. Department of Energy documents show that at least 9,500
gallons of radioactive nuclear waste leaked from the tanks in 1988.
   The documents indicate that at least seven of 149 aging
single-walled tanks leaked last year, adding to the more than
500,000 gallons that have leaked into soil surrounding the
million-gallon, single-shelled tanks since the late 1970s.
   Jim Thomas of the Hanford Education Action League, a
Spokane-based citizen's watchdog group, called the latest leaks ``a
drop in the bucket'' compared to past leaks.
   ``But environmental contamination is still happening,'' he said
Thursday.
   The Energy Department said the leaked wastes stay near the tanks
and don't enter the groundwater, posing no environmental or health
risks.
   Klink said 115,000 gallons that leaked from a tank in 1973 have
stayed within 165 feet of that tank.
   Single-walled tanks are no longer used. At least 95 of the tanks
have had pumpable liquids transferred into 28 newer double-walled
tanks on the site.
   The wastes are byproducts of more than 40 years of plutonium
production for nuclear weapons at the south-central Washington site.
   Hanford is generally considered the most contaminated of the DOE
production sites, and estimates for cleaning it up run to $57
billion over the next 50 years.
   Some of the single-shell tanks date back to the Manhattan Project
beginnings of Hanford in the early 1940s, and over the years at
least 66 of the single-shell tanks have been classified as ``assumed
leakers.''
   However, a large volume of non-pumpable but moist ``salt cake''
remains at the bottom of the tanks. Energy Department officials
admit they are unsure how to permanently dispose of those highly
concentrated wastes.

<HEAD>Japanese Defense Chief Expresses Regret Over Tower Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Defense Agency today expressed
regret over U.S. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower's call for
Japan to increase its military spending.
   ``As for Mr. Tower's comment that Japan can greatly increase its
defense efforts under the constitution, I have the feeling Mr. Tower
does not understand the Japanese people's feelings and
perspective,'' agency director-general Kichiro Tazawa told reporters.
   ``I regret that Mr. Tower went so far as to refer to our
constitution to push us to expand our defense spending,'' said
Tazawa.
   His comments were in response to statements Wednesday by Tower,
who is undergoing confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   Tower, a former Republican senator from Texas, said the
constitution formulated during the post-war U.S. occupation of Japan
``severely restrained them from building a substantial military
force'' and was ``a lousy idea.''
   ``But I don't believe that constitution is so restraining that
they couldn't devote a substantially larger percentage (of spending)
to their defense,'' Tower said.
   The Japanese constitution, adopted in 1946, renounces war and
forbids the use of force in settling international disputes. But
Japan has been steadily building up its armed forces in recent years
in response to heavy pressure from the United States.
   Acting U.S. Defense Secretary William Taft on Thursday hailed
Japan's increased allotment for defense in its budget for the next
fiscal year.
   ``I commend the government of Japan for continuing to do what is
necessary to meet Japan's defense goals and to positively support
U.S. forces in Japan,'' he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
saying. ``Given the continuing threat posed by Soviet forces in the
Pacific, growth in Japan's defense and cost-sharing efforts is fully
justified.''
   Japan's Cabinet this week approved a budget for fiscal 1989 that
includes $30.5 billion for defense spending, a 5.9 percent increase
over the previous year. The budget still must be passed by
Parliament.
   The proposed defense budget will amount to slightly more than 1
percent of Japan's gross national product _ the total value of goods
and services _ as it did in 1988 and 1987. The United States devotes
about 6 percent of its gross national product to military spending.
Washington's European allies spend about 3 or 4 percent on defense.

   Balmy temperatures and a lack of snow in such typically snowbound
sections as Wisconsin and New England have made this a winter of
discontent for devotees of pastimes like snow sculpting and
snowmobiling.
   In Milwaukee, the popular U.S. International Snow Sculpturing
Competition would have been snowless had organizers not saved 10-ton
blocks of snow from a storm last month. Ice sculptors were forced
inside Thursday by temperatures in the upper 30s.
   ``Now that's not Wisconsin in the winter,'' said Wendell Howard
of Waukesha, who was visiting the Icebreaker Winter Funfest there.
``We like something around more around zero or 20 below, at least
for a couple of weeks in January.''
   In snow-starved Boston, traditional winter white has been
replaced by dreary browns and grays. About an inch of snow fell
Thursday, but was quickly melted by a drizzle.
   ``You take what you can get,'' said National Weather Service
meteorologist Bernie Schor.
   Boston gets 12.5 inches of snow during a normal January and has
temperatures in the 30s. This year, the weather has been dry and
warm, with temperatures above 50 degrees some days.
   ``This is not a record year, but it's down with a handful of low
years,'' Schor said.
   Milwaukee has had 12.5 inches of snow so far this winter, only
about a fourth of the normal seasonal total. Temperatures this month
have averaged more than 28 degrees, about 10 degrees above normal.
   The weather posed a major problem for the winter festival and its
snow sculpting contest, which draws thousands of spectators and
features highly detailed creations more than 8 feet tall crafted by
teams from 10 nations.
   Organizers recommended that sculptors work at night when
temperatures are lower, ordered wood chips to cover muddied grounds
and moved ice-sculpting events to an ice house.
   Snow sculptors ``looked really dejected, really disappointed''
because they had to be indoors, Karin Bach of the Canadian women's
team, said Thursday. ``But we're all back today and we'll still have
some excellent works no matter what the weather,'' she said.
   Gene Kempfer, director of the snow sculpting competition, said
the forecast for spring-like temperatures this weekend forced him to
move up the time of the judging Saturday so judges could see the
finished products before the sun began melting them.
   The weather has also been bad news for snowmobilers in southern
Wisconsin.
   ``We're wiped out this year as far snow goes,'' said Dick
Killian, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Snowmobiles Club.
   In upstate Wisconsin, snow has been plentiful for skiers, but ice
fishermen have been advised to use caution because frozen lakes are
not as solid as they should be.
   In Boston, the mild weather has lowered heating and municipal
costs. The city has spent about $700,000 on winter-related jobs like
snow removal, compared to the $2 million spent by this time last
year, said city Public Works Commissioner Joe Casazza.
   The dearth of moisture has prompted concern about water supplies.
   ``Our Quabbin Reservoir, which is the largest reservoir in the
Northeast, is down to 68 percent full and normally it is at about 81
or 82 percent of capacity so that's a significant shortfall,'' said
Ilyas Bhatti, director of Metropolitan Watershed Management Division.
   ``We are definitely concerned about it. I think if we don't get
enough precipitation this winter, we're probably going to be facing
severe water supply problems this summer,'' he said.
   Skiers in New England have had to ski on machine-made snow until
the past couple weeks.
   Some places have gotten snow. On Thursday, a driving snowstorm
dumped up to 6 inches of snow on much of Maine, delaying flights,
closing schools and causing numerous traffic accidents.
   But merchants had little hope the storm would salvage poor sales
of such winter gear as shovels and snow tires.
   ``For us, it's (too) far into winter for it to do any good,''
said Robert Jackman, sales manager of Wescott &amp; Sons in Standish.
``You need a couple good storms a few times a week ... then people
will get back into winter products.''

<HEAD>Vietnam: Cambodian Talks Will Go On Without Sihanouk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's foreign minister today said
Cambodian peace talks in Indonesia would be held as scheduled
despite reports that Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk will not attend.
   Nguyen Co Thatch compared the peace talks beginning Feb. 19 with
the final 15 minutes of a soccer match where everyone is ``trying to
score a point. If anyone misses the match, it is his
responsibility.''
   ``The match will continue, I only hope Prince Sihanouk will
change his stand,'' Thach told a news conference.
   Reports from China published in Indian newspapers today quoted
Sihanouk as saying he will not take part in the talks. Sihanouk
reportedly linked his decision to the rejection of his five-point
Cambodian peace plan by Hun Sen, premier of Cambodia's
Vietnam-backed government.
   ``The role of Prince Sihanouk is very important, but he cannot
decide everything,'' Thach said.
   Thach was in India along with Nguyen Van Linh, secretary-general
of Vietnam's Communist Party, who was the chief guest at India's
republic day celebrations on Thursday.
   Vietnamese troops invaded Camdobia in late 1978 and installed a
pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh. Vietnam says it will pull out
completely from Cambodia by the end of 1990 or perhaps sooner if a
political solution is reached.
   Hanoi says it now has 50,000 troops in Cambodia. But U.S.
diplomats in Bangkok put the figure at 80,000.
   The Vietnamese are fighting a coalition of three major Cambodian
resistance groups: the communist Khmer Rouge, the non-communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front of former Cambodian Prime
Minister Son Sann and followers of Sihanouk.
   Armed strength of the resistance is generally estimated at about
47,000, with the Khmer Rouge as the strongest faction.
   The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1978 to drive the Khmer Rouge
from power. From the 1975 takeover of the Khmer Rouge to its ouster,
it is estimated that about 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people
died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.

<HEAD>Chinese Executed 100 In Province This Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 people were executed in the first 20
days of the year in China's crime-ridden southern province of
Guangdong, a newspaper today quoted officials as saying.
   The number of death sentences given by courts during the period
doubled from the first 20 days of last year, Mai Chongkai, the
acting president of the provincial People's High Court, was quoted
as saying.
   The independent Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao did not detail the
crimes committed by those given the death penalty, which in China
usually is carried out by a single bullet to the back of the head.
Earlier reports had said 10 robbers and murderers were executed Jan.
20 in the province.
   Zhou Tongping, vice president of the Guangdong court, was quoted
as saying incidents of serious crime in the province rose faster
than the national rate last year, although he did not give a
specific figure. Serious offenses such as murder and robbery
increased 66 percent nationwide in 1987.
   The report said the regional economic boom and influx of people
from other areas in China is a main reason for the province's high
crime rate.

   How do you examine a 400-pound gorilla? Very
carefully, say veterinarians at Miami's Metrozoo.
   Jimmie, the zoo's star peanut-catching lowland gorilla, came due
for his annual physical exam Wednesday, and it proved to be more
trying for the vets than for the patient.
   The 22-year-old ape has been at Metrozoo for five years and
apparently knew something was up when veterinarian Scott Citino
appeared at his enclosure. Jimmie bobbed and weaved like a boxer as
Citino tried to shoot him with an anesthetic dart.
   It took three hours and several blasts of the dart gun before
Jimmie was hit with a dart that put him to sleep. Only then did he
get his physical, which was a good deal more physical for the
zookeepers than for Jimmie.
   It took eight keepers to lift Jimmie off the bed of a pickup
truck into Metrozoo's ultramodern hospital. There he was weighed,
X-rayed, inoculated for tetanus, injected with antibiotics, attached
to an electrocardiograph, tested for tuberculosis, probed with an
ultrasound machine and checked for eye, ear and throat diseases. He
even had his teeth cleaned and blood samples taken.
   Cardiologist Donald Rosenberg, who had never examined an ape
before and was brought in because keepers feared Jimmie had a heart
problem, was ecstatic afterward.
   ``Jimmie's a lot better than a lot of my patients,'' he said.
``He doesn't sound off, and he doesn't have thoughts of malpractice
in his head.''

   Forget the better mousetrap. Andrew Brown
has designed the better tennis racket.
   That's what Brown says, and he's won over at least one
authoritative convert. No, not Mats Wilander _ we're talking about
Frank Katch, chairman of the exercise science department at the
University of Massachesetts.
   When Katch tried out Brown's racket, which has a six-sided handle
instead of the traditional eight, he hit perfect backhands on the
first few tries.
   ``I have never done that before,'' the professor said in
amazement.
   By scrutinizing the racket through high-speed cameras and a
computer that traced reflective markers on players' wrists, Katch
said he verified Brown's claim that shifting the handle angle
slightly and making it hexagonal rather than octagonal does wonders
for shots.
   Brown, a Cincinnati actuary, said the inspiration for the handle
came when he and his wife suffered a humiliating loss to another
couple. ``They ran us off the court. I got so incensed by the whole
thing, I said, `I'm going to do something about it.'''
   He spent a month shaving the angles off a wooden handle at home,
building new angles with wood putty and testing his experiment every
morning before work at a tennis club.
   ``It turns out the guy was within hundredths of a degree
correct,'' Katch said. ``It makes the wrist work like it's supposed
to work.''

<TEXT>
   The Japanese Cabinet decided today to confer one of
Japan's highest decorations on Mike Mansfield, who recently retired
as U.S. ambassador to Japan after 11 years in Tokyo, the Foreign
Ministry said.
   Mansfield will receive the Grand Cordon of the Order of the
Rising Sun, Paulownia Flowers, the highest award bestowed on foreign
recipients of Japanese government decorations, ministry officials
said.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita plans to present the medal to
Mansfield when he visits Washington next week for talks with
President Bush, the officials said.
   According to the ministry, only seven foreign dignitaries have
received the paulownia flowers decoration. They include kings from
Thailand, Nepal, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, former West German
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Gen. Douglas MacArthur,
commander-in-chief of allied forces in post-war Japan.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi told reporters that
Mansfield will be honored in recognition of his ``outstanding
contribution he has rendered to further cement friendly relations''
between the two countries.
   When Mansfield left Tokyo on Dec. 23, the 85-year-old former
senator said, ``Much remains to be done. However, the foundation has
been laid. I am confident that our governments and our peoples have
the means and the will to find the solutions that will ensure even
closer cooperation in the years to come.''

   The coast guard today recovered four bodies believed
to have been crewmen of a freighter that collided with another
vessel and sank in waters off western Japan, officials said.
   Three helicopters, nine boats and a plane continued the search
for survivors from the 2,900-ton Catherine-Rose, which collided with
the 2,400-ton Semba Wang from Singapore and sank Thursday.
   The Catherine-Rose was carrying 17 South Korean crew members,
said Joji Imai, a duty officer at the Tokyo headquarters of the
Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   All four bodies had life jackets with the name of the
Panamanian-registered freighter printed on them, Imai said.
   The Singapore-registered Semba Wang sustained minor damage and no
injuries, officials said.
   Imai said a coast guard helicopter first spotted the bodies about
a half-mile off Yoshimi-cho, 530 miles west of Tokyo.
   The bodies had not yet been identified.
   The Catherine-Rose left Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, on Tuesday with
a cargo of 3,000 tons of scrap steel, but lost radio contact with
the port of Pusan in South Korea late Thursday. The ship was to
arrive in Pusan this morning.
   The Semba Wang was traveling from Yosu on South Korea's
southwestern coast to Mizushima, 350 miles west of Tokyo, when the
accident occurred, the officials said.
   News reports said the Semba Wang veered right when it saw the
other boat approaching but collided when the second ship also
steered in the same direction.
   Kyodo News Service quoted crew members from the Semba Wang as
saying they returned to the accident site 10 minutes later and found
two people in the water shouting for help, but were unable to rescue
them because of rough waters.

   U.N. special envoy Jan Eliasson arrived in
the southern Iraqi port of Basra from Tehran today seeking to
breathe new life into stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks, officials
reported.
   Eliasson inspected cease-fire lines in the region and was
scheduled to fly by helicopter to Baghdad later for meetings with
senior Iraqi leaders, including Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, U.N.
officials reported.
   Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador and Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar's special emissary, said before leaving Tehran:
``It is very important to create a new momentum to speed up the
trend of future peace talks.
   The negotiations began Aug. 25, five days after a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire in the 8-year-old gulf war took effect.
   The talks ended in deadlock Nov. 11 after several sessions, with
both sides accusing the other of obstructing progress.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, quoted Eliasson as saying at Tehran airport that his four
days of talks with Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati and other officials were ``very useful and
fruitful.'' He did not elaborate.
   IRNA quoted Musavi as blaming Iraq for the deadlock by refusing
to withdraw from territory Iran claims the Iraqis captured in a
series of offensives before the cease-fire took effect AUg. 20.
   Before leaving Iran, Eliasson inspected the southern front line
with Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Lavasani, IRNA said.
   The agency said the envoy was taken to an area where Tehran said
the Iraqis captured several hundred Iranians after the Aug. 20
cease-fire. Eliasson also saw three burning oil wells which the
Iranians said the Iraqis set afire.
   ``After this visit, effective steps will be taken by the
secretary-general to secure the release of our prisoners and in
helping us extinguish these oil wells,'' IRNA quoted Lavasani as
saying. He did not elaborate.
   U.N. officials in Baghdad said Eliasson's talks were aimed at
exploring possibilities for resuming the peace talks. No date has
been set for a new round of negotiations.
   The talks have stalled on Iraq's insistence that a 1975 treaty
drawing the southern border between the two countries down the
middle of the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway is invalid.
   Before the treaty, the border ran down the eastern, Iranian bank
which meant the Iraqis effectively controlled the waterway, their
main outlet to the Persian Gulf. Iran insists the treaty is still in
force.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Stepped-Up Inspections After Engine Drops from Boeing
737</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with FAA ordering inspection; ADDS Boeing
response to television report of misassembled parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered
stepped-up inspections for the bolts holding engines to the wings of
Boeing 737 jets after investigators found that cracked bolts caused
an engine to fall off a plane in Chicago last week.
   Under the directive, issued Thursday, the FAA is requiring U.S.
airlines to decrease the interval for ultrasonic inspections for
cracks in cone bolts from 600 to 300 landings. The directive applies
to 432 planes in Boeing's 737-100 and 737-200 series.
   Dick Meyer, an FAA spokesman in Seattle, said the directive also
requires more checks to ensure that the cone bolts have been
properly installed.
   The order stemmed from a Jan. 20 incident in which the right
engine fell off a Piedmont Airlines plane immediately after takeoff
from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   The control tower immediately told the pilot to return to O'Hare,
but tapes released this week showed the pilot never fully realized
the problem until the plane was back on ground a few minutes later.
   None of the 27 passengers or six crew members was injured.
   The incident was the second of its kind involving a Boeing
737-200 series twin-engine jet in the last 13 months.
   James Kolstad, acting chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, blamed the accident on metal fatigue that caused a
back bolt to fracture. That, in turn, put the two front bolts under
stress, causing their eventual fracture and leaving the engine free
to fall off, he said.
   His conclusion was delivered in a letter Thursday to FAA
administrator T. Allan McArtor.
   ``There are several ways it (fatigue) could have happened,'' said
William Bruce, who is heading the NTSB investigation. ``What caused
the fatigue is what we're looking for.''
   Meyer said the agency soon will issue a notice of proposed rule
making to reduce the amount of time airlines have to install
secondary support structures to help hold the engines on the planes.
   Airlines currently must install the supports within 4,000
landings after the original order was issued.
   Records show the Piedmont jet involved in the O'Hare incident had
been inspected properly, according to Kolstad's letter, and the
engine-mount bolts fractured after just 330 cycles.
   The Piedmont jet did not have the secondary support structure,
but had not completed 4,000 cycles since the most recent FAA order.
   In his letter, Kolstad recommended the FAA require installation
of secondary support structures ``as early as the availability of
parts permits.''
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the Seattle aerospace company
praised the FAA's order, adding, ``we think it's the safe thing to
do.''
   At a news conference Thursday, Boeing officials also responded to
a television report saying more than 20 Boeing jetliners were fitted
last fall with misassembled parts. The problem was unrelated to the
problems involved in the Chicago incident.
   Phil Condit, a Boeing vice president, said a pin installed as a
safety backup to ensure steering cables remained on a pulley was
misassembled in three 737 jets, but ``safety was never an issue.''
   ``The airplane would have been perfectly safe without having it
(the backup safety pin) there at all,'' Condit said, adding that
``the process and the system worked'' in discovering the problem.

   Vaudeville veteran Pinky Lee, who was the
host of one of the earliest children's television shows, was
hospitalized today after suffering a mild heart attack while
performing in the musical ``Sugar Babies.''
   Lee was listed in serious but stable condition at St. Francis
Medical Center.
   ``He is pain-free and resting comfortably,'' medical center
spokeswoman Theresa Staley said Thursday. Lee apparently has no
history of heart trouble.
   The hospital did not have Lee's age. Published reports put it
between 62 and 89.
   The entertainer collapsed backstage Wednesday while starring in a
one-night performance of the vaudeville-style musical before a
Peoria Civic Center Crowd of about 2,000 people.
   ``It was almost a full house,'' said center spokesman Denny
Johnston. Few in the crowd were aware of Lee's heart attack, said
booking manager Debbie Ritschel.
   Lee, whose real name is Pincus Leff, was star of the daily NBC-TV
children's program, `The Pinky Lee Show,'' broadcast in 1950 and
1954-56.

   The city finally has admitted
Ragtime the tiny stallion is really a horse of a different color.
   After a two-year fight to evict the pint-sized steed that Patty
Fairchild keeps as a pet, the City Council voted Wednesday night to
give up.
   Larry Horner, mayor of this Los Angeles suburb, said the decision
came partly because council members were afraid of being saddled
with an international reputation as animal-haters.
   ``From New York to Nova Scotia, people are telling us to stop
picking on the horse,'' Horner said. ``It's time to just bow out of
it.''
   Ragtime, who stands just 27 inches tall, is a special breed of
miniature horse. He sleeps in the yard but has the run of the house,
and is even allowed to sit on the sofa and watch television.
   ``I'm just relieved,'' Mrs. Fairchild said after the vote. ``It
just feels good that it's all over.''
   Some people in Mrs. Fairchild's upper middle-class neighborhood
say a horse is a horse, no matter how small, and they spurred the
city on in its efforts to kick Ragtime out in keeping with an
ordinance barring farm animals from residential neighborhoods.
   The issue has been in court twice, most recently two weeks ago,
when Ventura Municipal Judge John Hunter decided Ragtime was a pet,
and so couldn't be corralled out of the neighborhood under the
anti-livestock law.
   But neigh-sayers like the Oakbrook Village Homeowners Association
say they haven't given up yet. The association will raise its
anti-Ragtime arguments once again in a lawsuit scheduled for a
hearing Feb. 27.

   A judge called three polygamist clan
members ``anarchists'' before sentencing them to up to 15 years in
prison for killing a state corrections officer in a shootout at the
family's farm.
   ``These defendants acted as anarchists, and this court has been
presented with no credible information that, if given the
opportunity, they would not again engage in anarchism and armed
conflict,'' Third District Judge Michael R. Murphy said Thursday.
   Murphy sentenced clan leader Addam Swapp, 27, and brother-in-law
John Timothy Singer, 22, to one to 15 years in Utah State Prison for
manslaughter. Swapp's brother, Jonathan, 21, received a one-year
jail term for negligent homicide.
   The sentences were pronounced two days before the first
anniversary of the Jan. 28 shootout at the clan's Marion compound
that ended a standoff with state and federal officers. Corrections
Lt. Fred House was killed and Addam Swapp was wounded in the
exchange.
   The impasse had begun 13 days earlier, when Addam Swapp bombed a
Mormon chapel near the farm.
   House was killed during an attempt to arrest the Swapp brothers
as they walked outside the main farmhouse, where nine children were
closeted with the six adults.
   House was directing his reluctant dog toward the pair when he was
struck by a bullet that nicked the armhole of his armored vest.
   Singer admitted firing the fatal shot, but insisted he was only
shooting at the dogs. Jonathan Swapp also acknowledged firing his
rifle but said he shot only to keep his wounded brother from being
hit again.
   Addam Swapp, wounded in the wrist and chest, did not fire.
   Swapp has said the chapel bombing was a divinely inspired act
intended to trigger the resurrection of his late father-in-law, John
Singer, and the collapse of a ``wicked and corrupt'' church and
state.
   Singer, the clan's patriarch, was killed in 1979 by police during
an arrest attempt at the same farm. Addam Swapp is married to two of
Singer's daughters.
   John Timothy Singer's attorney, Fred Metos, said his client would
appeal the conviction and sentence.
   Last May, the Swapps, Singer and his mother, clan matriarch
Vickie Singer, were convicted of federal offenses in the bombing and
standoff.
   In September, U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins sentenced Addam
Swapp to 15 years, John Timothy Singer and Jonathan Swapp to 10
years and Vickie Singer to five years imprisonment.

   The planned withdrawal of South
African troops from Namibia will cost about $62 million, and more
than 100,000 tons of equipment will be removed, the armed forces
chief said today.
   Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys also told reporters that South Africa did
not plan to move any extra troops into Walvis Bay, an enclave owned
by South Africa on the Namibian coast.
   Critics of South Africa have claimed existing military bases in
Walvis Bay will be expanded during the withdrawal.
   Earlier this week, South African officials at the United Nations
denied an assertion that there were 100,000 South African troops in
Namibia. Geldenhuys declined to disclose the correct figure, citing
security concerns.
   He said equipment moved from Namibia's far-northern war zone to
military headquarters in Pretoria would cover more than 1,050 miles.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since 1915, but has agreed to
yield control of the mineral-rich former German colony in accordance
with a U.N. plan for the territory's independence. Implementation is
scheduled to begin April 1, and independence elections are to take
place Nov. 1.
   Geldenhuys said all but 12,000 South African troops would be
withdrawn by mid-May and all but 1,500 would be out by Nov. 1.
   On Thursday, Namibia's transitional government announced it would
disband March 1 in preparation for the independence process.
   After April 1, when a U.N. monitoring force is to arrive, the
territory will be administered jointly by U.N. and South African
officials until independence.

   An aide to Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin held
secret meetings with a jailed Palestinian linked to the PLO, and
reports of their talks were passed to top PLO officials abroad, an
Israeli newspaper said today.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber declined to comment on the
report. Israel officially bans contacts with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which it views as a terrorist group. It
bitterly protested a U.S. decision last month to open a dialogue
with the group.
   The daily Maariv reported that the meetings took place between
Shmuel Goren, Israel's policy coordinator for the West Bank, and
Faisal Husseini, whom the Defense Ministry confirmed Thursday would
be freed.
   Maariv said the two discussed possible peace initiatives,
including Rabin's plan to hold elections in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip and to grant Arabs limited autonomy following a
three-to-six-month cease-fire in the Palestinian uprising.
   The talks reportedly took place during the past week in the Kfar
Yonah prison in central Israel, where Husseini has been serving a
six-month term without trial.
   Fuad Al-Aref, an associate of Husseini, said he talked with the
jailed Palestinian leader Monday and asked about rumors that he had
been meeting a Defense Ministry official. ``He denied it,'' Al-Aref
said.
   Husseini is due to be freed from prison Sunday, and the daily
Hadashot reported he would meet with Rabin after his release to
discuss the defense minister's plans for peace negotiations.
   Rabin's proposal, made public early this week, has been rejected
by the PLO and several local Palestinian leaders.
   Similar proposals in the past have been turned down by the PLO as
inconsistent with demands for an independent Palestinian nation.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also dismissed Rabin's plan, saying
the government has not yet formulated its official peace proposals.
   The Israeli government, led by the right-wing Shamir, has come
under increasing pressure to introduce some kind of peace initiative
as the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising continues.
   The United States and European countries have criticized Israel's
harsh efforts to end the uprising _ which has taken 369 Palestinian
and 15 Israeli lives _ and have moved closer to PLO chief Yasser
Arafat since he recognized Israel and renounced terrorism last month.
   In the occupied territories today, soldiers shot and wounded four
Palestinians in sporadic clashes with stone-throwing protesters. The
army confirmed one injury in the West Bank city of Tulkarem.
   Hadashot said that after Husseini's release, he was to see Rabin
and then test feelings in the occupied territories toward peace
proposals.
   Husseini, the son of a Palestinian hero who fell leading a battle
against the Israelis on Jerusalem's outskirts in 1948, has ties to
the PLO and Hamas, the fundamentalist Moslem movement that opposes
any compromise with Israel.
   He was jailed in April 1987 and has spent most of the last 21
months under administrative detention _ emergency regulations that
do not require specific charges or a trial. He was last arrested in
April. Israel has accused him of being a ringleader of Palestinian
resistance.
   Husseini heads an institute in East Jerusalem, the Arabic Studies
Center, that researches Palestinian history and culture.

   Jack Kemp, seeking confirmation as secretary of
housing and urban development, told Congress today that homelessness
``is a national tragedy of appalling proportions'' and pledged to
improve housing conditions in America.
   In remarks prepared for his confirmation hearing before the
Senate Banking Committee, Kemp said ``we can help recapture the
American dream for our distressed inner cities and those who live in
poverty and despair.''
   On the problem of homelessness, Kemp noted that President Bush is
committed to full funding of the McKinney Act, which Congress passed
last year to provide emergency shelter.
   But he said ``funding, while necessary, is not sufficient. We
need to work together to provide a complete and effective safety
net'' with both public and private efforts.
   ``It is a national tragedy of appalling proportions that there
are Americans without basic shelter and human services,'' Kemp said.
   He also pledged to work toward making home ownership possible for
people in public housing, to press for urban enterprise zones to
encourage inner city development, and to seek a national housing
policy that will make housing more affordable for poor and young
families.
   Kemp has shored up support among his former colleagues on Capitol
Hill, personally meeting or speaking by telephone with each member
of the panel since Bush nominated him. Most have said they
unequivocally support his confirmation, and a few declined to make
their decision public before the hearing, but none said they oppose
him.
   ``I think it was one of the best appointments the new president
made,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a conservative ally. ``I'm
sure he's going to be confirmed.''
   Gramm said he hoped to question Kemp about the possibility of
expanding nationwide a pilot program begun two weeks ago in Dallas
that makes vacant HUD houses available to families with incomes as
low as $15,000 a year.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, Budget Committee chairman and member of the
subcommittee on housing who supports Kemp's confirmation, wants to
know what direction Kemp plans to take on several rental subsidy
programs due to expire soon.
   In notes prepared for today's session, the Tennessee Democrat
said that by ``not addressing this situation head on it seems that
we are making a policy choice to increase the number of homeless.''
   He also intended to query the nominee about proposals to impose
user fees on federal home loans. Sasser said such fees would
increase interest rates on home mortgages, drive more people from
the housing market, contribute to stress on the rental market and
further increase homelessness. He also said the idea is ``contrary
to an explicit provision that the committee put in the 1987 Housing
and Community Development Act.''
   Others said they wanted to know his thoughts about rural housing
problems and energy efficiency in public housing.

<HEAD>Man Wants Comatose Wife to Undergo Abortion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man has asked a court to appoint him the
guardian of his comatose wife so he can authorize an abortion in an
attempt to help her recover.
   Martin Klein, 34, of Upper Brookville, said in papers filed
Thursday in state Supreme Court that doctors told him his wife,
Nancy, 32, would have a better chance of recovery if the pregnancy
were terminated.
   Supreme Court Justice John Burke signed an order which requires
North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, the state attorney
general and the Nassau County district attorney to show why Klein
should not be appointed guardian.
   Legal experts say the case is unusual.
   ``It is a very complicated, sensitive medical and ethical
question,'' said Andrew Schepard, a family law professor at Hofstra
University Law School. ``On the one hand the mother has a shot at
life, and on the other hand this is considered a viable fetus, and
who gets to decide? It is going to require complex medical
testimony.''
   Mrs. Klein, who is 16 weeks pregnant, has been in a coma and on a
respirator since being injured in a car accident Dec. 12.
   Dr. Joseph Smith of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
backed Klein with a letter to the court that said, ``I believe with
a degree of medical certainty that Mrs. Klein's pregnancy presents a
serious threat to her life.''
   Klein, who said he visits his wife almost every day, said his
wife's mother, Ann Zusselman, and other family members support his
request.
   A hospital spokeswoman, Carol Hauptman, declined to comment,
saying the hospital had not been served with the court order.
   The Kleins have a 3-year-old daughter.

   An inmate who escaped from a sheriff's
deputy after throwing down his crutches outside a hospital and
sprinting away has been recaptured, authorities said.
   Dennis John Hannuksela, who is awaiting trial on murder charges,
was arrested Thursday in a car in West Duluth, said Sheriff's Deputy
Charles Berquist.
   Authorities were acting on a tip when they apprehended
Hannuksela, Berquist said. Hannuksela escaped Wednesday.
   Two other occupants of the car were questioned and charges are
possible, Berquist said. He was unsure whether additional charges
would be filed against Hannuksela.
   Hannuksela, 29, had used crutches during his entire six-month
stay in jail. He had one foot in a splint when he ran for freedom
outside the Northland Medical Center. He had not been handcuffed
because of his condition.
   Sgt. Tom Person, a supervisor at the jail, has said Hannuksela's
injury was not faked and speculated that the prisoner,
``anticipating his escape, punched up his adrenaline to the point
that he could run like crazy.''

<TEXT>
   Government officials said the United States
informed them that a proposed four-mile border ditch would be built
to carry drainage, not to deter drug smugglers and illegal
immigrants.
   In a statement Thursday, Foreign Ministry officials acknowledged
they knew about plans for the 5-foot-deep, 14-foot-wide ditch along
the San Diego-Tijuana border. But they said they had been told it
was to solve rainwater drainage problems on the flat Otay Mesa,
along the international border.
   ``The Mexican government was not told the purpose of this
construction could be to control migration, or anything else of that
nature,'' the statement said.
   Several Mexican congressmen reacted angrily to the proposal,
calling it ``unfriendly'' and saying it would not stop the flow of
illegal immigrants.
   In the United States, immigrant rights activists called it
``repressive'' and ``ill-conceived.''
   The $2 million ditch, which Associate Attorney General Francis A.
Keating II likened to a ``buried Berlin Wall,'' will traverse an
area east of San Ysidro, Calif., that is a major route for drug
smuggling and border crossing.
   Keating said the primary purpose of the ditch would be to
discourage drug smugglers from driving cars and trucks across the
border.
   Although the Mexican government expressed no opinion on the
proposal, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is among those who say
the U.S. policy of exclusion fails to recognize that emigrants from
Mexico are filling a need by taking jobs that most Americans don't
want.
   Immigration experts say the isolated Otay Mesa is the most
popular crossing point for illegal immigrants along the 1,950-mile
U.S.-Mexico border.
   About one third of the 1.2 million illegal immigrants captured
along the border last year were apprehended at Otay Mesa. Officials
say up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally
into San Diego each month.
   The Foreign Ministry said the ditch had been discussed by the
International Boundary and Water Commission as a remedy for area
flooding problems. But it said the commission, which includes
members from both countries, never talked about the project as a
barrier to drug traffickers or illegal immigrants.
   ``Both governments, through their respective commissioners, have
been consulted about ways of resolving the problem of drainage of
rain waters,'' the statement said.
   ``The construction of this ditch is only one of many proposals
that have come before the commission and in no moment was it
approved by the two governments,'' it said.
   The Excelsior news service on Thursday quoted Deputy Guadalupe
Gomez Maganda, president of the foreign relations committee, as
saying the proposal was ``unfriendly.'' Gomez Maganda reportedly
said he would bring the matter up at the next interparliamentary
meeting on U.S.-Mexico relations.
   Deputy Alberto Ling Altamirano of the conservative National
Action Party said the proposal ``isn't so much aggressive as it is
silly.''
   ``They aren't going to stop anyone while there are hungry people
in Mexico and there is a clandestine labor market in the United
States,'' he said.
   The government news service Notimex also criticized the proposal
in an editorial, calling it ``a violent call to the attention of the
Mexican government and to all political and social groups interested
in the defense of sovereignty and national dignity.''
   In Washington on Thursday, a private group lobbying to stem the
flow of illegal immigrants proposed charging a $2 fee to enter the
country and using the money to tighten border security.
   The non-profit group, the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, said the estimated $500-$600 million a year in revenue from
the fees should go toward intensified patrols of the U.S.-Mexico
border and replacement of 28 miles of metal fence.

   A federal grand jury indicted a chain of art
galleries and its two top officials on fraud charges, claiming the
gallery sold fake Salvador Dali artworks over the past 12 years.
   Dali, a Spanish surrealist, died Monday in Spain.
   The indictment Thursday charged Center Art Galleries-Hawaii owner
William Mett, 46, of Kailua, and Vice President Marvin Wiseman, 44,
of Waikiki, with 93 counts of mail, wire and securities fraud in
Dali sales to 36 customers.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne said Mett and Wiseman have
agreed to surrender at their arraignment, probably next week.
   In a written statement Thursday, Mett said he was innocent.
   The indictment follows a three-year investigation by city, state

<HEAD>Private Company Will Seek to Develop Agent to Control Plant Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private company will seek to develop
commercially a first-of-its-kind biological agent for the control of
disease in major floral crops, the Agriculture Department said today.
   The commercial development will be handled by the W. R. Grace &amp;
Co., which has a research center in Columbia, Md.
   R. Dean Plowman, administrator of USDA's Agricultural Research
Service, said the biocontrol agent is based on a naturally occurring
fungus that attacks other harmful soil-borne fungi that cause
disease in floral crops.
   Tests at the agency's Beltsville, Md., laboratories _ just 15
miles from the W. R. Grace &amp; Co. facility _ showed that the agent
suppressed disease on a number of major floral crops, including
zinnias, snapdragons, chrysanthemums and poinsettias.
   Plowman said the agent was first isolated by a USDA scientist at
the Beltsville research center.
   Grace intends to evaluate the agent and then market the first
commercial product for use against fungus disease of greenhouse
crops, said Francois P. Van Remoortere, president of the company's
research division.
   The USDA and Grace signed a research agreement under a 1986 law
that authorizes increased cooperation between private companies and
individual federal research laboratories. The law encourages the
movement of federally developed technology into the marketplace.

<HEAD>Libyan Leader Wants Direct Contact With Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi says in a
television interview that he has never had direct contact with any
American administration and he would like to open a dialogue during
the George Bush presidency.
   He called Bush ``a man who is completely different from Reagan.
He's a politician, a factual man, a practical ... (man).
   ``Reagan used to treat the presidency as a theater where he
performs his acts.''
   Gadhafi spoke through an interpreter during the interview with
Barbara Walters, which was conducted Monday in a tent in Gadhafi's
compound in Tripoli. The interview is being aired tonight on the ABC
program ``20-20.''
   Gadhafi denied that he or his country support terrorism, but he
likened Palestinian terrorist leader Abu Nidal to George Washington,
Sun Yat-sen and Garibaldi as a liberator of his country.
   He advised a ``wait and see'' position with respect to recent
peace overtures toward Israel voiced by Yasser Arafat, leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   He said if Palestinians did get their homeland back, Israel would
cease to exist, because ``it is impossible to establish two states
between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.''
   He insisted that the chemical plant under construction in his
country will produce medicine and not chemical weapons, as the
United States charges, and said diplomats and reporters would be
invited to the opening.
   But he said he would not permit the precedent of letting outside
inspectors to have access to the plant at will.
   ``If this is going to be the case, we ought to nominate an
international observing commission to inspect all factories and
plants in the world continuously, periodically,'' he said.

   Iran's president today criticized
President Bush for saying that Washington would appreciate help in
gaining the release of the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon,
Tehran radio reported.
   Also today, hopes faded that two Britons held hostage in Lebanon
would be freed soon. A radio station said the expected release was
``mere speculation.''
   Apparently interpreting Bush's statements to mean that release of
the hostages was a pre-condition for resuming ties with Iran,
President Ali Khamenei said, ``In setting conditions for resumption
of ties, the American president should know that we, not they, have
conditions to set.''
   ``We have always said that ties with America can only be resumed
when America revises its arrogant attitude,'' Khamenei added.
   ``It was America which expressed interest in resuming ties with
Iran; Iran does not need America,'' the radio reported him as
saying. The report was monitored in Nicosia.
   Bush said in his inaugural address that the United States would
cooperate with any country that could help release the American
hostages in Lebanon.
   He did not mention Iran by name, but his remarks were seen as a
call for Iran to help free the hostages with the promise of better
relations.
   Ties between the United States and Iran were severed soon after
the 1979 Islamic revolution, when militant Iranian students took
over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for
444 days.
   Fifteen foreigners, including the nine Americans, are believed
held hostage in west Beirut by pro-Iranian factions. The hostage
held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Reports in Beirut the last three days spoke of a release by
Saturday of John McCarthy, a journalist, and Brian Keenan, a teacher
who holds Irish and British citizenship.
   A British Embassy spokesman had said the purpose of Ambassador
Allan Ramsey's visit Thursday to Moslem west Beirut was to check the
reports.
   However, embassy spokesman Antoine Haddad told The Associated
Press today: ``We still have no hard information.'' He would not
comment further.
   The Voice of the Nation radio station, based in Moslem west
Beirut, said today: ``Reports of an imminent hostage release
appeared to be mere speculation based on rumors.''
   McCarthy, 31, a producer for the London-based Worldwide
Television News agency, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove to
the airport for a flight home. Keenan, 38, was kidnapped six days
earlier as he walked to the American University of Beirut.
   No group has claimed the abduction of McCarthy or Keenan.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia To Reduce Its Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia announced today it
will cut its armed forces by 12,000 soldiers and reduce its army
budget 15 percent in the next two years.
   The move followed announcements of troop cuts by East Germany and
Hungary and of defense spending reductions in Poland.
   All four nations acted after the Soviet Union announced Dec. 7 it
will reduce its forces by 500,000 men by 1991. This will include
withdrawing 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks from East Germany, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia.
   The Warsaw Pact troop cuts have been billed by the Kremlin as a
boost to new East-West talks opening in March on reducing
conventional arms and weapons across Europe.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has also made clear that
slashing military spending will free more funds for sorely needed
modernization of Soviet bloc economies.
   Czechoslovakia's official CTK news agency announced the plans a
day after Soviet army Gen. Alexei Lizichev disclosed that Prague
planned to follow East Germany and Hungary into force reductions.
   The general gave no details, but CTK said later that it was
decided to cut the armed forces by 12,000 men over the next two
years and reduce military spending by 15 percent.
   According to data from NATO, Czechoslovakia has 145,000 soldiers.
   The Council for the Defense of the State also decided that
Czechoslovakia will scrap 85O tanks, 165 armored vehicles and 51
fighter planes, CTK reported.
   Military maneuvers and tactical exercises will be reduced by 5O
percent, and the number of reserve soldiers will be cut by 15,000
over the two-year period, CTK said.
   The measures are intended to ``increasingly emphasize the
defensive nature'' of the Czechoslovak army and represent ``gradual
implementation of the initiative to create a zone of trust,
coooperation and good neighborly relations between NATO and Warsaw
Treaty states,'' CTK said.
   It said Czechoslovakia is prepared to continue troop reductions
if NATO adopts similar measures.
   In the interview Thursday on CTK's Czech-language news service,
Lizichev also was quoted as saying the Soviets will eliminate 10,000
tanks and 800 planes worldwide as part of its announced reduction of
the Red Army.
   Hungary announced this year it will cut military spending by 17
percent, and Poland also has announced plans to reduce its military
outlay.

   A 41-year-old former legal secretary who calls
herself ``Billie Jean'' and claims she is married to pop superstar
Michael Jackson has been convicted of trespassing at the singer's
mansion.
   Lavon A. Muhammad, who also says Jackson fathered her 6-year-old
twins, was found guilty Wednesday of eight misdemeanor charges,
including trespassing and violating a court order to stay more than
100 yards from Jackson's Encino property.
   The woman, who calls herself Billie Jean Jackson, allegedly has
harassed Jackson for five years, leading to a 1986 restraining
order. Jackson's song ``Billie Jean,'' about a man denying a
paternity claim, is one of his biggest hits.
   In August, Ms. Muhammad tried unsuccessfully to buy a wedding
gown and have it billed to Jackson, and in December billed $145 in
medical expenses to the singer, whom she has never met, said Deputy
District Attorney David Kestenbaum.
   Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Stephen E. O'Neil told Ms.
Muhammad she faces a maximum 2{ years in jail at her sentencing
Monday, if she continues to refuse psychiatric treatment.
   Jackson, 30, was expected to make a live concert appearance at
the Los Angeles Sports Arena on Friday to end his 16-month world
tour following the release of his album ``Bad.''

<TEXT>
   More than 500 Burmese fled to Thailand today
and claimed they escaped from Burmese soldiers who raided their
village, kidnapped men and boys, and forced them to act as their
porters.
   The male refugees, ages 15 to 40, were hiding in the jungle in
this border area after fleeing their homes in Myawaddy village in
Burma.
   The refugees said government troops surrounded their village
Friday and led off males to haul artillery and mortar shells for
troops fighting ethnic minority rebels along the border. Thai
authorities confirmed their report.
   The Burmese are launching a major offensive against the ethnic
Karen, who field the strongest force among a dozen ethnic minority
rebel groups seeking greater autonomy from the central government in
Rangoon.
   That government has been sharply criticized in the past by human
rights groups, including the London-based Amnesty International, for
forcing villagers and Rangoon residents to do forced labor under
allegedly inhuman conditions.
   Burmese interviewed by The Associated Press last year said they
escaped from troops who had forcibly taken them from Rangoon to
carry heavy loads of equipment without pay. They said they were
given very little food and water.
   Maung Tun, a 40-year-old Burmese merchant among the latest
refugees, said the Burmese troops had seized 200 men in the village
Wednesday for forced labor. He said some villagers decided to flee
to other places inside Burma and to Thailand when the troops
returned to take more people Friday.
   Maung Hla, 28, quoted a Burmese soldier as saying troops were
also recruiting villagers to build a road to Kler Day, a former camp
of ethnic Karen insurgents. Burmese troops seized the camp on Jan.

   Two war criminals imprisoned 43
years for the deaths of thousands of Dutch Jews were freed from
prison today, officials said, hours after Parliament voted to pardon
them and expel them to West Germany.
   ``They're not only out of prison, they're on their way to the
Federal Republic where they will be handed over to the German
authorities,'' Premier Ruud Lubbers said of Franz Fischer, 87, and
Ferdinand Aus der Fuenten, 79.
   Lubbers gave no further details while talking to reporters.
   An ambulance left the prison in the southern city of Breda, where
the two had been held, and a prison wagon followed 10 minutes later
with police escorts, but neither Fischer nor Aus der Fuenten could
be seen. Authorities would not confirm the men were in the vehicles.
   The decision to pardon them came in the form of a rejection of a
motion to keep the men in prison.
   The 150-seat legislature voted 85 to 55 against the opposition
Labor Party's motion, made earlier this week. There were 10
abstentions.
   In West Germany, where the men have relatives, government
spokesman Ulrich Strempel said they would be welcome and there was
no record of charges pending against them. ``Our records indicate
that they will be free men,'' he said.
   Several demonstrators stood outside Parliament during the
debate.``Don't make the victims suffer further. Never release the
henchmen,'' read one placard.
   Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes indicated he would have
preferred it if Fischer and Aus der Fuenten had been put to death
years ago, but he said detaining them any longer would violate the
principle of equality under the law.
   During the war, Fischer headed a local branch of the Nazi
Security Service and was held responsible for the deportation to
death camps of 13,000 Jews. Aus der Fuenten was an SS administrator
of a body that oversaw mass roundups of Jews in the Netherlands.
   Both were sentenced to death in 1950, but a year later their
sentences were changed to life imprisonment.
   Of a prewar population of 150,000, only 6,000 Dutch Jews survived
the Holocaust.
   Korthals Altes said Fischer and Aus der Fuenten were the only two
war criminals whose life prison terms had not ended in pardons.
   On Tuesday, the government proposed a pardon. That prompted the
Labor Party's motion to keep them in prison.
   ``Let us rid our society of the miserable remainder of (Fischer
and Aus der Fuenten's) lives,'' Korthals Altes told the legislature.
   ``Personally, I ... think it would have been better in cases like
these if the death penalty ... had ultimately been executed,'' he
said.
   ``I regret having to use the word `pardon,''' Korthals Altes
said. ``This is not about showing clemency to the war criminals.''
   Shortly after the war, the Netherlands shot 40 war criminals,
including Anton Mussert, head of the Dutch Nazi party. The
government commuted a total of 110 death sentences into life
imprisonment.
   According to the government, Fischer and Aus der Fuenten spent
more time in prison than any other Nazi war criminals.

   Engineers have fixed a leak
discovered in a hydrogen fuel line on space shuttle Discovery, which
is being prepared for a late February launch.
   NASA said the leak, detected Thursday, was caused by a fuel line
misalignment that was quickly corrected once the source was known.
It was in a 2-inch line in a section that connects the shuttle to
its external fuel tank.
   Discovery's target launch date is Feb. 23, but preparations have
been running slightly behind schedule and officials said earlier
this week they expected a delay of at least two days.
   The delay could be longer if engineers don't learn why a part
cracked in a main engine during Atlantis' liftoff in December. They
believe two tiny cracks found in a turbopump during post-flight
inspection were caused by stress corrosion, apparently resulting
from moisture that somehow penetrated the metal.
   Until they discover the source of the moisture, NASA will not
clear Discovery for flight. Officials have expressed confidence the
problem will be resolved in time to meet a February launch date.
   If it isn't, NASA is considering other options, including
postponing the Discovery flight until after an Atlantis mission set
for liftoff in April.
   NASA has said that if Discovery can't get off the only launch pad
available by March 14, it would postpone that mission until after
the Atlantis launch because the Atlantis crew has only a 25-day
period starting April 28 during which it can deploy the Magellan
payload to probe the planet Venus.
   Magellan has priority over Discovery's communications satellite
because Venus will not be in position again to receive a visitor
from Earth until May 1991.
   Meanwhile, in Huntsville, Ala., a space shuttle engine firing
test scheduled at Marshall Space Flight Center was delayed after a
problem was found in the engine control box, NASA officials said.
   The problem was discovered late Wednesday as workers completed
last-minute checks, said Len Worlund, deputy director of the
center's propulsion laboratory.
   NASA spokesman Jim Sahli said today that the shuttle flight
schedule would not be affected by the delay since the engine is in
the developmental stages.
   The 45-second firing, which was scheduled for Thursday afternoon,
was to be the last of three preliminary tests before engineers begin
a program to explore new engine technology. The test has been
postponed until next week.
   The engine control box, or controller, regulates all valves in
the engine and monitors temperature, pressure and other conditions.

   A procurement officer with the Marine
Corps and two defense industry figures pleaded guilty today to
criminal charges in the government's investigation of wrongdoing in
the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year purchasing operation.
   The Marine official, Jack A. Sherman, 52, admitted in U.S.
District Court that he accepted bribes in return for providing
confidential information about Pentagon contracts. He agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors in the continuing investigation.
   Also pleading guilty were Robert Barrett, a former executive at
Unisys Corp., a defense contractor, and Joseph E. Hill, a consultant
who did work for Unisys and its predecessor, Sperry Corp.
   The two men entered guilty pleas to various charges stemming from
illegal campaign contributions to members of Congress knowledgeable
about the defense procurement business.
   It was the first time that congressional campaigns had been
publicly linked by prosecutors to the defense procurement scandal,
code-named Operation Ill Wind.
   Today's pleas marked a continuation of court actions in the
investigation.
   On Jan. 6, a federal grand jury here indicted a Navy employee,
five other individuals and the defense contractor Teledyne
Electronics with a variety of charges including conspiracy,
racketeering and bribery. The same day, Hazeltine Corp. and five men
pleaded guilty to a different set of charges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph J. Aronica said Sherman was
charged with two counts: conspiracy to commit bribery and the
receipt of bribes by a public official. He faces a maximum of 20
years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Prosecutors said Sherman received a total of $43,500 between
October 1986 and June 1987 from an unnamed consultant. The FBI
recorded either by audiotape or videotape 16 meetings between the
consultant and Sherman, prosecutors said.
   ``In return for the offers and payments of money, Sherman agreed
to perform and did perform acts which were ... in violation of his
duties as a Marine Corps employee,'' prosecutors said in a statement
of facts.
   They said Sherman agreed to provide the consultant with
confidential information relating to the competitive process on a $6
million contract that Sherman was responsible for awarding.
   Sherman also provided the consultants in April 1987 with internal
government documents on an upcoming $100 million contract that a
company paying the consultant won.
   The prosecutors detailed a complex arrangement in which Sherman
was also receiving money from other consultants who were paid by
various defense contractors. None of the consultants or the
companies was named in the court documents.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton set Sherman's sentencing
for April 7.
   In the pleas involving campaign contributions Barrett, 55,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and in
aiding and abetting in making false statements to the government. He
faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   The government charged that Barrett was involved in a complicated
scheme in which money was funneled to the election campaign of
former Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla. Chappell chaired the House defense
appropriations subcommittee until his defeat last November.
   According to prosecutors, Sperry-Unisys paid consultants with the
understanding that the consultants would contribute an unspecified
portion of the funds to political campaigns.
   Barrett collected undated checks from the individuals and gave
them to another agent of Unisys who made the contributions to
Chappell's campaign in 1986 and 1987, prosecutors said.
   Hill, 76, of Mineola, N.Y., pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor
counts of making political contributions in the name of another. He
faces a maximum of four years in prison and a fine of $400,000.
   Prosecutors said Hill was paid by Sperry-Unisys and ``was ...
asked by representatives of Sperry-Unisys to make numerous
contributions in his name.''
   Between 1982 and 1988 he contributed over $25,000 to political
campaigns at the direction of his employer, prosecutors said.
   Among the campaigns to whom Hill contributed in 1987 and 1988
were those of Reps. Roy Dyson, D-Md.; Rep. William Dickinson,
R-Ala.; and Richard Ray, D-Ga., and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.

   Police arrested one youth today and were
searching for another a day after a gunman opened fire on a crowd
outside a high school and wounded four students.
   The suspect, identified as Rodney Reardon, 18, of Washington, was
charged with four counts of assault with intent to kill in the
incident, which occurred a few hours after two young ``outsiders''
had argued with students in the cafeteria at Woodrow Wilson High
School, police said.
   According to witnesses, a gunman stepped out of a four-wheel
drive vehicle as students were leaving for the day, fired a few
shots, then began to shoot randomly.
   Three of the victims were shot in the leg and the other was shot
in the upper lip, but none of the injuries was serious, hospital
officials said.
   The shooting, which occurred in an affluent section of northwest
Washington, took place one day after a triple slaying brought the
city's homicide total this month to 39.
   ``I am outraged that less than 24 hours after three people were
executed on our street, we have four young people wounded,'' Mayor
Marion Barry said. ``I am urging the Metropolitan Police Department
to spare no resources to solve this case.''
   The assailants were not students at the school, according to
Capt. Robert Gales of the District of Columbia police.
   School system spokesman Charles Seigel said two ``outsiders''
entered the school at about noon and were involved in a ``verbal
altercation'' with students.
   The students agreed to a fight after school, Seigel said, and
were on their way to the site when the shootings occurred.
   When asked if any of the victims knew the assailants, Gales said,
``I think some of the victims know who was involved.''
   Andrew Jenkins, superintendent of schools, said he planned to
dispatch a crisis intervention team to the school today to help
students deal with the aftershock of the incident.
   School officials also said they would beef up security at Wilson
High.
   The shootings occurred at about 2:30 p.m. Police said Tyrone
Whitfield, 18, was shot in both legs; Kofi Martinez, 17, suffered a
superficial wound in the right leg; Jamal Smith, 17, was shot in the
right leg; and Lazaro Santa Cruz, 16, was shot in the lip.
   Stacy Karageorgos, a sophomore, said she was looking out a window
of the school when she saw a man with a gun climb out of a
dark-colored jeep.
   ``He stood out of the jeep and aimed at first. He knew where he
wanted to shoot, and then he just started shooting at random,'' she
said.
   ``At first they were aiming for one person and then they starting
shooting randomly,'' she said.
   The shootings came a week after a shooting incident outside a
school in Stockton, Calif., in which five children were killed.
   In the California shootings, a young drifter wearing combat
fatigues opened fire Jan. 17 with an assault rifle at children in an
elementary school yard. Five children were killed and 30 people were
wounded before the gunman shot himself to death.

<HEAD>Soviet Nurses Infect Children With AIDS, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nurses using tainted syringes infected 27 children
with the AIDS virus at a southern Russian hospital, and authorities
are searching other facilities for similar cases, a newspaper
reported today.
   In an article titled ``Diagnosis: Syringe,'' the labor daily Trud
said ``criminal negligence'' was under investigation at the
children's hospital in Elista. Authorities discovered the outbreak
in November, the newspaper said.
   The Soviet Union only recently admitted to an AIDS problem and
started diagnosis and treatment programs.
   Trud said that of 300 people screened at the hospital, 27 babies
and children, most under two years old, and four mothers were found
to have the deadly disease.
   The newspaper said further tests were planned on 1,000 children
at the hospital, as well as on patients at facilities elsewhere in
Russia.
   ``I believe it can be said simply: guilty are the medical
workers, nurses who probably used non-sterile syringes or used one
syringe, changing only the needle, which is about the same thing,''
said V.I. Pokrovsky of the Central Scientific Research Institute of
Epidemiology in Moscow.
   He told Trud an investigation and trial would be conducted.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Forty-five minutes before his execution
in Florida's electric chair, Ted Bundy described in precise detail
the location of two victims' bodies in Utah and Colorado,
authorities have disclosed.
   In a final interview with Florida State Prison Warden Thomas
Barton, the serial killer gave directions to investigators trying to
find the two bodies, but denied involvement in any murders in four
other states. The interview was made public by Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez' office late Thursday.
   Bundy said he didn't know the identity of his Utah victim, but he
believed the Colorado victim was Denise Oliverson, 24, last seen
riding her bicycle in April 1975 near her home in Grand Junction.
   Sgt. Greg Kuhn of the Grand Junction, Colo., Police Department
said today officials will listen to the Bundy tape and talk to the
investigator who interviewed Bundy. Police probably will decide
Monday whether to search for Oliverson's body, he said.
   In Utah today, about 20 searchers with metal detectors focused on
an area 10 miles southeast of Price, in central Utah, in a search
for one Bundy victim, said Carbon County Chief Deputy Jerry Cowan.
   The searchers had metal detectors to pick up any jewelry that
might have been worn by the victim. But Cowan said there is heavy
snow cover and the prospects for success were uncertain.
   ``The snow covers the sagebrush, resembling mounds, but we're at
least going to make an effort,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, officials in Washington state expressed anguish over
another legacy left by the serial killer: a request that his ashes
be scattered over the Washington Cascades.
   ``Personally, I'm kind of offended by the whole thing,'' said
Dale Potter, a spokesman for the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National
Forest. ``I expect the hiking community and many other people who
use the national forest land would be somewhat offended by the
thought of it.''
   However, Potter said there are no regulations to prohibit Bundy's
ashes from being scattered over the mountains, where the bodies of
some of his victims were found.
   In Bundy's five-minute interview with Barton, conducted at 6:15
a.m. Tuesday, he used a map to point out the sites where he had left
the two victims in Utah and Colorado. Bundy was executed shortly
after 7 a.m.
   His memory of the Utah victim was especially vivid as he
pinpointed a dirt road between Price and Green River.
   ``About 200 yards in on the dirt road ... and to the left, maybe
50 yards, there's the remains of a young woman who disappeared from
Brigham Young University in June of 1975,'' Bundy said.
   Bundy had been suspected in the death of Susan Curtis, 15, who
was attending a youth conference at Brigham Young University when
she disappeared in June 1975, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.
   Bundy, 42, said the Colorado victim was dropped in a river.
   ``I believe the date was in April 1975,'' Bundy said. ``The young
woman's body would have been placed in the Colorado River five miles
west of Grand Junction. It was not buried.''
   ``That's all the ones that I can help you with,'' Bundy said.
``The ones that I know about. No missing ones outstanding that we
haven't talked about.''
   In response to further questions, Bundy specifically denied
killing anyone in Illinois, New Jersey, Vermont or Texas.
   ``Okay, that's all we've got,'' Barton said. ``Okay, Ted. Thank
you.''
   Bundy quietly answered, ``You're welcome.''
   Bundy was executed for the February 1978 rape-murder of
12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake City, Fla. In the days prior to
his execution, Bundy confessed to 23 murders. Investigators believe
he may be linked to as many as 100 deaths beginning in 1969.
   A Washington state investigator who interviewed Bundy before the
execution said Thursday that he ran out of time before he could ask
the killer about two Oregon women who disappeared in 1973.
   Robert Keppel, chief criminal investigator for the Washington
attorney general's office, said he was unable to inquire about the
disappearances of Rita Lorraine Jolly and Vicki Lynn Hollar.

<HEAD>Official Says Du Pont Advocating Lower Safety Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the Energy Department's
crippled nuclear weapons plant in South Carolina has advocated
lowering a safety standard that is complicating efforts to reopen
the plant, the chairman of a safety advisory panel said today.
   John Ahearne, chairman of the department's Advisory Committee on
Nuclear Facility Safety, said E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. has been
seeking for about three years to establish a scientific
justification for lowering the minimum standard for judging the
safety of nuclear reactors.
   He said the du Pont effort was not directly related to efforts to
reopen the Savannah River Plant's nuclear reactors, which have been
closed since last year for safety and technical reasons.
   The lower standard, if adopted, would nonetheless make it easier
to restart the reactors, he said.
   Ahearne said du Pont has been trying ``to make the case'' that
the current definition of the worst possible accident at a reactor _
the complete break of a major cooling water pipe _ was unnecessarily
strict. Du Pont's research has focused on basing safety judgments on
the lesser danger posed by a leak in the pipe, which would give
enough warning time to shut the reactor and avert a pipe break.
   No du Pont officials at Savannah River were immediately available
to comment on Ahearne's remarks.
   As recently as last December, the committee reviewed du Pont's
scientific work and concluded it was ``a long way'' from justifying
the lower safety standard, Ahearne said.
   Ahearne, in a telephone interview, denied a published report that
he told a Senate committee on Thursday that the Energy Department
was considering reducing the safety standard so it could speed the
reopening of the ``K'' reactor at the Savannah River Plant, which
has been closed for safety since last April.
   He said department safety officials were ``very, very skeptical''
of the proposal, which also has been under study for years in the
civilian nuclear industry. He said he told the panel that du Pont
favored the idea, not the Energy Department.
   Gary Pitchford, an Energy Department spokesman at Savannah River,
said today there was ``no consideration being given to changing''
the reactor safety standard in connection with efforts to restart
the ``K'' reactor there.
   Savannah River is the nation's only producer of tritium, a
perishable gas vital to making nuclear warheads. The Energy
Department has said it hopes to have the tritium-producing reactor
back in operation by the end of this year, but recurring safety and
managerial problems have put that target in doubt.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
has decided to turn down an invitation to visit Afghanistan and
observe the final phase of the Soviet troop withdrawal, U.N.
officials said today.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was
no point in the U.N. chief visiting at this time, before what is
widely assumed will be the fall of the Soviet-backed Kabul
government to U.S.-backed Afghan rebels.
   But they said Perez de Cueller has not informed Afghanistan he
will not be coming and that the invitation is still officially under
consideration.
   Officials said Afghan President Najib recently invited the U.N.
chief to visit, partly in the hope that his presence would prevent
more bloodshed.
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, all Soviet troops are to
withdraw by Feb. 15, and heavy fighting has been reported between
the soldiers and the rebels.

<TEXT>
   An Indian woman says hospital workers violated
her right to religious freedom when they forced her to stop a
purification ritual in her hospital rooment Bush is
committed to full funding of the McKinney Act, which Congress passed
last year to provide emergency shelter.
   But he said ``funding, while necessary, is not sufficient. We
need to work together to provide a complete and effective safety
net'' with both public and private efforts.
   ``It is a national tragedy of appalling proportions that there
are Americans without basic shelter and human services,'' Kemp said.
   He also pledged to work toward making home ownership possible for
people in public housing, to press for urban enterprise zones to
encourage inner city development, and to seek a national housing
policy that will make housing more affordable for poor and young
families.
   Kemp's hearing was interrupted by a demonstration of six members
of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, an advocate for the
homeless.
   They shouted accusations that the nominee was partly responsible
for the reduction in affordable housing available to low-income
Americans.
   The four women and two men were taken from the hearing room by
Capitol police and security personnel.
   Kemp has shored up support among his former colleagues on Capitol
Hill, personally meeting or speaking by telephone with each member
of the panel since Bush nominated him. Most have said they
unequivocally support his confirmation, and a few declined to make
their decision public before the hearing, but none said they oppose
him.
   ``I think it was one of the best appointments the new president
made,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a conservative ally. ``I'm
sure he's going to be confirmed.''
   Gramm said he hoped to question Kemp about the possibility of
expanding nationwide a pilot program begun two weeks ago in Dallas
that makes vacant HUD houses available to families with incomes as
low as $15,000 a year.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, Budget Committee chairman and member of the
subcommittee on housing who supports Kemp's confirmation, wants to
know what direction Kemp plans to take on several rental subsidy
programs due to expire soon.
   In notes prepared for today's session, the Tennessee Democrat
said that by ``not addressing this situation head on it seems that
we are making a policy choice to increase the number of homeless.''
   He also intended to query the nominee about proposals to impose
user fees on federal home loans. Sasser said such fees would
increase interest rates on home mortgages, drive more people from
the housing market, contribute to stress on the rental market and
further increase homelessness. He also said the idea is ``contrary
to an explicit provision that the committee put in the 1987 Housing
and Community Development Act.''
   Others said they wanted to know his thoughts about rural housing
problems and energy efficiency in public housing.

   Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., political
extremist and perennial presidential candidate, was sentenced today
to 15 years in prison for scheming to defraud federal tax collectors
and deliberately failing to repay more than $30 million in loans
from his political supporters.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. also sentenced chief
LaRouche fundraiser William Wertz to five years in prison and an
$11,000 fine, and gave LaRouche legal coordinator Edward Spannaus a
five-year term and a $10,000 fine.
   At the same time, governmnent prosecutors in Boston dropped
related charges against LaRouche and three of his associates.
Charges against three other defendants who are fugitives were
maintained. That case ended in a mistrial last May and had been
scheduled for retrial on Feb. 22.
   In a document filed in U.S. District Court in Boston today, the
prosecutors said that, with the conviction of LaRouche and his
associates in Alexandria last month, the law enforcement interests
of the United States had been served ``from the point of view of
both deterrence and punishment.''
   In the federal courthouse in Alexandria, fundraisers Michael
Billington and Dennis Small received three-year prison terms and
fines of $8,000 each. Fundraisers Paul Greenberg and Joyce
Rubenstein were given three-year terms and $6,000 in fines each.
   LaRouche attorney Odin Anderson of Boston said all seven
defendants would appeal. He called LaRouche a prominent political
figure and said his ``many powerful enemies have had their day.''
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson called the sentences ``a very
satisfying culmination to a very long journey,'' but added:
   ``This will never repay all those victims who have been swindled
out of millions of dollars over the years. I feel sorry for those
people.''
   Bryan told LaRouche, who stood facing the judge with arms folded
in front of him, that he had been convicted of ``a serious crime''
and said he rejected LaRouche's belief ``that the end justifies the
means as resorted to in this case.''
   Bryan refused to grant bail to the three main defendants pending
appeals.
   The judge also rejected as ``errant nonsense'' the defendants'
claims that their prosecution by the government was politically
motivated. He said the idea that LaRouche's organization was of
sufficient threat to warrant such a prosecution ``just defies human
experience.''
   LaRouche's sentence was considerably less than the maximum
penalty on 13 counts of tax and mail fraud conspiracy. The maximum
would be 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25 million.
   Before he was sentenced, LaRouche told the judge that his case
``already has done great damage to the United States'' and that ``it
is time for this evil and reckless prosecution to be brought to a
halt before further damage is done.''
   U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson responded that ``this is not a
political case, this was a case of theft.''
   Bryan said he was concerned that the defendants never conceded
they had done anything wrong, despite their convictions.
   But Spannaus said:
   ``Remorse should be felt by those who perverted our judicial
system for political purposes and trampled on the Constitution.''
   Outside the federal courthouse in this Washington suburb, about
60 LaRouche supporters sang, waved American flags and paraded with
bedsheet banners reading ``Pardon LaRouche _ Kill Satan'' and ``Stop
KGB Frame Up-Murder of LaRouche.'' A demonstrator wearing a large
mask of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and carrying a Soviet
flag gestured on the sidelines as the pickets paraded on both sides
of the street in front of the courthouse.
   A federal trial jury in Alexandria convicted LaRouche and the six
associates on Dec. 16 of mail fraud and conspiracy for raising more
then $30 million in loans from political supporters without any
intention of repaying them. One elderly woman testified she had lost
nearly $113,000 in life savings.
   LaRouche also was convicted of scheming to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid by various
corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable income.
   LaRouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year
since 1978, government prosecutors said.
   It was the first time in LaRouche's controversial political
career that he has been convicted of criminal charges. LaRouche, 66,
has run for president in the last three elections as a Democrat or
an independent candidate espousing unorthodox conspiracy theories on
world issues.
   Immediately after his conviction in Alexandria, LaRouche told
reporters he was the innocent victim of a frame-up by Soviet
sympathizers in the State and Justice departments. He predicted he
would be killed if sent to prison.
   Bryan released LaRouche and the six other defendants on their
personal recognizance. Since his conviction, aides said, LaRouche
has visited West Germany, home of his wife, Helga, and attended a
``human rights tribunal'' in Rome.
   LaRouche spokeswoman Dana Scanlon said the political maverick's
supporters planned to hold a round-the-clock vigil in Lafayette
Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, until
LaRouche is released from federal prison. She said demonstrations
also were planned outside the federal courthouse in this Washington
suburb.
   Elsewhere, jury selection was under way in Loudoun County Circuit
Court in Leesburg, Va., where LaRouche headquarters are based, in a
Virginia state trial of LaRouche fund-raiser Rochelle Ascher on 12
counts of securities fraud.
   Ms. Ascher is the first of 16 LaRouche associates and five
organizations facing separate trials on state securities fraud
charges. LaRouche himself is not a defendant in the Leesburg case.

   Federal prosecutors dropped conspiracy and fraud
charges against Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. today, as the political
extremist was sentenced in Virginia in connection with $30 million
in defaulted loans.
   All charges were dropped against LaRouche and three associates,
but the Justice Department said it will not drop charges against
defendants in the case who are fugitives.
   LaRouche was sentenced in the Virginia case to 15 years in prison
for scheming to defraud federal tax collectors and deliberately
failing to repay more than $30 million in loans from his political
supporters.
   The U.S. Attorney's office had vowed to pursue the Boston case
regardless of the verdict in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.,
but the stiff sentence he faced convinced officials that justice has
been served.
   ``In short, the interests of the United States and effective law
enforcement having thus been served from the point of view of both
deterrence and punishment, it is the government's view that further
prosecution is not warranted given the resources such prosecution
would demand, and the relatively slight benefits likely to flow
there from,'' according to a document filed today.
   LaRouche, who has run for president four times, is known for his
extreme views _ including support of an AIDS quarantine and often
vitriolic anti-Soviet rhetoric.
   The complex Boston case, which ended in a mistrial last May,
included allegations of government infiltration of LaRouche groups
purportedly involving the FBI, CIA, Oliver North and other
government operatives. A retrial was scheduled to begin Feb. 22.
   LaRouche, six aides and five political organizations were charged
with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into
allegations that Larouche's 1984 presidential campaign raised more
than $2 million through credit card and loan fraud.
   LaRouche was charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with
investigators. All the aides and organizations also were charged
with conspiracy, and four of the groups were charged with fraud.
Three more defendants are fugitives.

<HEAD>Steinberg Jury Rehears Testimony on Nussbaum's Condition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors deliberating the child murder case against
disbarred lawyer Joel Steinberg have asked for fresh clothing,
hinting that a verdict might not come quickly.
   The request came after the jury, which began its fifth day of
deliberations today, asked Thursday to rehear testimony on the
physical condition of Steinberg's abused companion, Hedda Nussbaum.
Defense lawyers accuse her of the November 1987 killing of
6-year-old Lisa Steinberg.
   The Manhattan state Supreme Court jury asked if it could use the
doctor's testimony and a videotape of Ms. Nussbaum to assess her
condition and capabilities at the time of the child's death. Justice
Harold Rothwax said it could.
   They retired Thursday at 8 p.m. without reaching a verdict and
resumed deliberations at 10:20 a.m. today.
   But before quitting for the day, the sequestered jurors, who
began deliberating Monday, asked for fresh clothing to be sent to
them from their homes, an indication they were perhaps still a long
way from a verdict.
   Steinberg, 47, is charged in the fatal beating of Lisa, whom he
illegally obtained at birth from an unwed Long Island teen-ager. The
child was removed comatose from Steinberg and Ms. Nussbaum's
apartment Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three days later.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, testified against him in exchange for limited
immunity from prosecution. Steinberg's lawyers charge it was Ms.
Nussbaum who fatally beat the girl. Prosecutors at first charged
her, along with Steinberg, but later said she was too physically and
emotionally disabled to have harmed the child.
   The jury Thursday asked to rehear testimony of Dr. Neil Spiegel,
an emergency room doctor at Bellevue Hospital who examined Ms.
Nussbaum after her arrest on Nov. 3, 1987, and found her
``chronically debilitated, malnourished, wasted,'' and described
numerous bruises, cuts and broken bones.
   The judge has told the jury it may not use Ms. Nussbaum's
condition to conclude that because Steinberg allegedly beat her, he
therefore beat Lisa.
   Rothwax has told the jury that it must unanimously acquit
Steinberg of murder before considering lesser charges of
first-degree manslaughter, second-degree manslaughter and criminally
negligent homicide.

   Leftist rebels blew up part of Colombia's

Ecopetrol said Friday.
   It was the first time the pipeline, in northwestern Colombia, was
attacked this year. Rebels have blown up parts of the pipeline 67
times since it was built three years ago.
   The pipeline, which was attacked Wednesday, will be shut through
Saturday, the company said.
   The pipeline takes oil 500 miles from the Canon Limon field along
the Venezuela border to the Caribbean port of Covenas. It pumps
about 220,000 barrels a day.

   President Bush said today he found nothing
unseemly about former President Reagan signing a multi-million
contract to write his memoirs.
   Bush was asked at a news conference whether, in light of the
stress the new president has put this week on ethics in government,
he felt Reagan was ``cashing in'' on his presidency.
   Reagan reportedly will receive $5 million for his memoirs and a
book of speeches from Simon &amp; Schuster. In addition, a partner in
the Washington Speakers Bureau has a ``handshake agreement'' to
represent Reagan and his wife, Nancy, as their exclusive lecture
agents.
   One industry source, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said it would be reasonable to assume the former president could
command $40,000 for a speech.
   Asked about the book deal, Bush said, ``I don't call it cashing
in. I suspect every president has written his memoirs and gotten
money for it. ... I don't think it's ever been challenged.''
   Bush did not address the question of lecture fees for Reagan.
   Bernie Swain, a partner in the speakers bureau, said he was in
the process of signing Reagan up.
   ``I have a handshake agreement. That is all I am working on right
now,'' he said.
   Swain said the terms of the agreement with the Reagans had not
been settled.
   He said most of the former president's speaking engagements would
be in the West, at least for the present. The Reagans now live in
Los Angeles.
   Don Walker, president of the Harr Walker Agency in New York, said
his firm represent several speakers who get fees in the $40,000
range. But generally that amount is paid for speeches which require
travel.
   The Walker agency's clients include former Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, former President Ford and former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, among others.
   Swain said his firm had received requests in the past to arrange
speeches by Reagan while he was in office, but had referred all such
requests to the White House.
   He said Maureen Reagan, the president's daughter, and former
White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein had also been added to
the bureau's roster of speakers this week.

   President Bush today endorsed a proposed 50
percent salary increase for members of Congress and similar raises
for other high government officials.
   ``The raise is overdue, there's no question about that,'' Bush
said at his first presidential news conference. He noted that
Congress is considering abolishing the right of members to earn
thousands of dollars in speech honoraria in exchange for the $45,500
raise, from $89,500 to $135,000 a year.
   Asked whether the pay raise was appropriate even though the
hourly minimum wage has been frozen at $3.35 since 1981, Bush said
he has never felt that raising the minimum wage is the ``key to
prosperity'' for poor people.
   He said, however, he wants to maintain a ``certain flexibility on
that question.''
   Meanwhile, Capitol Hill sources said House negotiators have
reached a tentative agreement that would require members to give up
much more than their speaking fees in return for the 50 percent pay
raise.
   Senate leaders were not far behind in negotiating a contingency
plan to restrict outside income should the raise become law, as
expected, on Feb. 8, a Senate source said Thursday.
   Both houses are expected to move hastily to restrict non-salary
income once the raise kicks in, to minimize the political damage and
avoid the embarrassment of members earning considerable outside
income in addition to their new salary of $135,000.
   Developments on the negotiations, reported by sources who
insisted on anonymity, came Thursday as House opponents of the raise
admitted they have virtually no chance to prevent the dramatic rise
in salary from the current $89,500. Rep. Thomas J. Tauke, R-Iowa, a
leading opponent, said he's now focusing on long-range strategy to
roll back the increase.
   Under a special procedure not followed for other legislation, the
pay raise for Congress, judges and top executive branch employees
becomes law unless both houses vote to reject it.
   The Senate is expected to reject the raise in a vote promised by
its leaders, but House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., has said
House leaders are not planning to vote on the pay hike.
   The tentative House package, which still needs further
negotiation, would include:
   _An end to the honoraria system, which has allowed rank-and-file
House members to keep up to $26,850 of the money they earn each year
from speeches, articles and other appearances.
   _Abolition of the ``grandfather'' loophole in campaign financing
law. The loophole has allowed 190 House members who were in office
as of Jan. 8, 1980, to stockpile more than $39 million in surplus
campaign money for their personal use. The provision does not apply
to senators.
   _Restrictions, probably time limitations, on travel for speaking
engagements and other appearances. This would prevent members from
getting long vacations at resorts from special interests, who
invited them to speak for free.
   _Restrictions on non-honoraria outside income.
   A Senate leadership aide said once the raise becomes law, ``the
Senate will move promptly to ban honoraria.'' But the aide said
details of the proposal must still be negotiated.
   The House package is designed to make financial restrictions
broad enough so that lawmakers will be able to stand the heat from
angry constituents. Thousands of Americans have listened to radio
talk show hosts and sent their representatives tea bags, symbolic of
the Boston Tea Party, to protest the raise.
   A House leadership source said the package in that chamber is
designed ``to bar honoraria in a comprehensive and tough way, to get
at all the issues which revolve around payment of money to members
by special interest groups.''
   ``The purpose is not to write a narrow-gauge vehicle that deals
simply with fees for speeches,'' the source said.
   The House negotiators on the issue have been Coelho; Rep. Vic
Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations legislative
subcommittee; House GOP Whip Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., and Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the House Republican Conference.
   Tauke said he would try to organize a meeting of opponents next
week to work out long-range strategy to roll back the raise after it
takes effect.
   ``We recognize the pay raise is not going to be stopped. So we
have to look at alternative strategies,'' he said.
   Any long-range strategy would focus on finding a legislative
mechanism to bring the pay raise issue to the House floor.
   Tauke said the Senate could provide such a vehicle by passing
legislation introduced last Wednesday. The bill, anticipating the
raise would become law, would rescind the increase entirely for the
executive and legislative branches. It would require recorded votes
for any future pay raises.
   Tauke said opponents of a raise could try to attach that bill
onto any House measure, thereby forcing a vote on members' pay.
   If the legislation is bottled up in committee by the Democratic
leadership, Tauke said, opponents could try for a discharge
petition, which takes 218 signatures to force legislation from
committee.
   Tauke has introduced his own legislation which would require a
recorded vote on pay raises, make congressional pay recommendations
separate from those of the other branches, and prevent any
congressional raise from taking effect until after the next election.

U.S. diplomat. ^By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that a lot of
uncertainty exists about the civil warfare in Afghanistan in the
wake of the Soviet troop withdrawal and that the U.S. Embassy there
was closed to protect American lives.
   Bush, in a wide-ranging news conference in the White House
briefing room, was asked about Secretary of State James A. Baker
III's decision to evacuate the fewer than 10 diplomats and security
guards left in the U.S. Afghan outpost. All travel by American
civilians to the war-torn country had already been banned.
   The aim of the U.S. diplomatic pullout is to make sure no
Americans are exposed to the strife that is expected to intensify
when the last Soviet troops depart. All 50,000 are supposed to leave
the country by Feb. 15.
   Bush said he did not discuss the turmoil in Afghanistan in a
conversation with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last week, but
that he was convinced the Soviets would continue their withdrawal.
   Bush went on to say that he believed there is ``uncertainty about
what follows,'' and that he hoped the United States would play a
``catalytic role for helping bring about stability'' in the future.
   ``I think there's a lot of uncertainty. There's enough
uncertainty that the secretary of state was taking prudent action in
this regard,'' Bush said. ``It is a prudent policy to protect a
handful of American lives.''
   Afghan guerrillas, armed by the United States and Pakistan, are
fighting to wrest control of the country from government forces
backed by the Soviets. The drive by the Mujahedeen rebels for Kabul
and a deteriorating situation in that capital threatened to expose
the Americans to the cross-fire.
   The U.S. diplomatic contingent was gradually reduced over the
years, and the country has been without a full-time American
ambassador since Adolph Dubs was killed by Afghan forces a decade
ago.
   The Red Army's departure, under the Geneva accords signed last
April, will remove a stabilizing influence on the Kabul government.
The guerrillas, meanwhile, are likely to redouble their offensive
against government forces no longer backed by Soviet troops.
   Apart from the small contingent of about 10 diplomats and guards,
there are fewer than 20 U.S. citizens in Afghanistan. They have been
encouraged to leave, and the State Department has urged Americans
not to travel to the country.
   On Wednesday, the mayor of Kabul said the capital had a
three-month supply of food and fuel in case of a guerrilla siege.
Soviet soldiers handed out emergency rations. Soviet cargo planes
began flying loads of flour and fuel to Kabul on Saturday.
   The Reagan administration, in its final days, pondered whether to
abandon the embassy or to leave the decision to its successors. A
U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it finally
was left up to Baker and he decided to close the embassy on his
first day of the job.
   Earlier, Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman,
quoted reports from Kabul that Soviet and Afghan artillery attacks
had obliterated a number of villages south of the Salang Tunnel,
through which Soviet troops are departing the country.
   ``There are eyewitnesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds
of civilians were killed,'' Redman said. He said no U.S. embassy
personnel were in the devastated area.

   President Bush's trip to China next month
underscores the importance of American relations with the world's
largest country, and although the two have no overriding problems,
Bush has some serious issues to discuss with the Chinese.
   One is the joint effort the United States and China are making to
promote reconciliation between South Korea and North Korea. Another
is the growing improvement in relations between China and the Soviet
Union.
   Bush's trip will be the first visit to Beijing by a U.S. chief
executive in nearly five years. President Reagan visited the Chinese
capital in April 1984.
   But while Bush looks to the Far East, stopping lso in Japan for
Emperor Hirohito's funeral and in South Korea, two other regions
where problems are far more pressing have been consigned at least
for now to the back burner.
   Bush and his top foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, the national security
adviser, are taking their time about the Soviet Union and the Middle
East.
   ``Let's take our time now,'' Bush told reporters today. ``Let's
take a look at where we stand.''
   He said he did not think after a long talk on the telephone with
Soviet Preisdent Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the Soviets consider his
reflective stance ``foot-dragging.''
   Baker, who is inexperienced in both areas, told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation hearing that he
wanted to ``review the bidding'' in U.S.-Soviet negotiations to
reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
   Baker also said the United States should avoid ``a headlong
rush'' to provide Moscow with loans and credits, which are
traditionally a useful tool in improving relations.
   Scowcroft has more experience in foreign policy matters, but he
too is taking a very cautious approach in dealing with Moscow. He
worries that Gorbachev's peace offensive may have as one of its main
goals ``making trouble within the alliance'' of Western nations. He
is suspicious that Gorbachev's motivation is to buy time to reform
the Soviet economy _ which is a lot different from approaching
Gorbachev primarily as a world leader trying to ease East-West
tensions.
   ``I think the Cold War is not over,'' Scowcroft said in a recent
assessment of the superpower relationship.
   While Bush has not insisted on concessions from Moscow before
ascending the summit with Gorbachev, the White House spokesman,
Marlin Fitzwater, said Thursday they would meet only ``when the time
is right.''
   It's a bit early to make sweeping judgments, but the indications
are a slowdown in the reconciliation promoted by President Reagan
and Secretary of State George P. Shultz after Gorbachev's rise to
power in the Kremlin in March 1985.
   There is a similar go-slow attitude developing toward the
Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East, which drew serious
attention from the Reagan administration toward the end but hardly
the concentration trained on Moscow.
   Reagan and Shultz, in their final days, broke a 13-year embargo
and opened U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Shultz made five trips to the Middle East in 1988, and while neither
the Arabs nor Israelis agreed to negotiations, Shultz left office
optimistic about the future.
   ``There is more diplomatic fluidity now and opportunity there
than there's been in some time,'' he told reporters on his final
trip, to Vienna, last week.
   Baker, on the other hand, emphasized that ``we ought to all be
realistic about the prospects for achieving a breakthrough.'' He
also told the Senate committee ``there is no more intractable
problem facing us.''
   Baker was cool about the dialogue with the PLO, suggesting it
would be continued only if it proved useful. And he ruled out a
Palestinian state, which the Reagan administration also opposed.
That appears to eliminate an option that has ardent Arab support and
could make it more difficult to entice Arab nations into any U.S.
scenario for the Middle East.

   President Bush, convening his first news
conference far from prime time, said today he intends no
``footdragging'' in U.S.-Soviet affairs and that his trip to China
next month is not designed to unsettle relations with the Kremlin.
   Bush also gave his endorsement to a proposed $45,000 pay raise
for members of Congress and sidestepped questions about a proposal
to place a fee on savings accounts to help rescue the troubled
savings and loan industry.
   The free-wheeling question and answer session, lasting more than
40 minutes, marked the end of Bush's first week in the Oval Office.
``There's still a wonder of it all,'' the new president said.
   ``We're ready to roll,'' he added.
   Bush said he had assured Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that his
intention to move slowly isn't a negative signal. ``I don't think
the Soviets see that as footdragging. I'm confident they don't,'' he
said.
   ``I want to take the offense in moving this relationship
forward,'' he said.
   Asked about American citizens being held hostage in the Middle
East, he said: ``Unless the information I have is wrong, Iran
itself, the government, is not actually holding these people. And if
they were I would reiterate my view that the way to improve
relations is to let 'em go. Give these people their freedom. They
didn't do anything wrong.''
   Bush seemed relaxed, if a little hoarse from a cold, calling on
one reporter with the words,``You're up.'' He paused at one point to
ask his questioners whether they wanted follow-up questions, a
tradition from President Reagan's news conferences. Bush's first
formal meeting with reporters came at 11 a.m. _ far from the
night-time gatherings favored by Reagan.
   Bush fielded questions after telling reporters gathered in the
White House briefing room, ``It's been a full week since the
inauguration and I just wanted to stop by and give you an update.''
   He cited his first-week emphasis on ethics in government, and
said he hoped to ``assemble a government that the people of this
nation can be proud of.''
   He also said he believed he had begun a ``fresh constructive
dialogue with Congress on both sides of the aisle.''
   But he also said he expects a tougher time ahead when he begins
grappling with more contentious issues such as the budget. He
stepped away from the most controversial item of his first week in
office, a suggestion to place a premium on savings accounts to help
rescue the savings and loan industry. He said the proposal hadn't
yet reached his desk.
   ``It doesn't bother me for a lot of ideas to be debated and
considered,'' the president said.
   ``Anything I do on savings and loans...I don't expect it's all
going to be sweetness and harmony and light,'' he added.
   At the same time, Bush sought to reassure depositors, saying the
S&amp;Ls ``are sound, they are good, dollar-good...nothing is going to
change in that regard.''
   Asked about superpower relationships, the new president said he
didn't know where his first major foreign policy initiative would
be, whether in the Middle East or Central America or elsewhere. ``I
don't want to play defense, I don't want to look like we're
foot-dragging and letting others set the agenda,'' he said.
   As for the pay raise, which would give a 50 percent salary
increase to members of Congress, federal judges and top-level
government officials, Bush said, ``The raise is overdue, there's no
question about that.'' Bush noted that Congress is considering
abolishing speaking honoraria in exchange for the controversial
raise, and said he favors that, too.
   When asked whether the pay raise was inappropriate since the
minimum wage had been frozen at $3.35 per hour since 1981, Bush said
he's never felt that raising the minimum wage is the ``key to
prosperity'' for poor people.
   But he said he wants to maintain a ``certain flexibility on that
question'' and will discuss proposals for an increase with Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole. Bush said he would want any miminum wage
increase to be tied to a training wage.
   On one key campaign pledge, Bush said he would push for his
proposed cut in capital gains taxes.
   The president also said he would briefly visit South Korea at the
tail end of an Asian trip that includes a stop to Japan to attend
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito and a subsequent visit to China.
   Bush spent more than a year as the U.S. envoy to Peking in the
1970s, and said he and his wife Barbara were looking forward to
their return.
   He said his visit was not designed to ``go one up on Mr.
Gorbachev'' in terms of superpower relationships. Asked if he was
trying to send a signal by visiting China before meeting with the
Soviet leader, Bush said he was not one to play one superpower off
against another.
   ``I'm the one wo doesn't believe in playing the Soviet card or
playing the China card,'' he said.
   Bush said his watchword on U.S.-Soviet relations would be ``let's
take our time now.''
   ``Prudence is the order of the day,'' he said, but then he added:
   ``I want to take the offense in moving this relationship
forward.''
   The new president quickly added he didn't know where his first
major foreign policy initiative would be, whether in the Middle East
or Central America or elsewhere. ``I don't want to play defense, I
don't want to look like we're footdragging and letting others set
the agenda,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel OKs Carla Hills for Trade Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee voted 18-0 today
to recommend confirmation of attorney Carla Hills as U.S. trade
representative, a job she said she would use to open global markets
``with a crowbar if necessary.''
   ``You have done well and you have answered with more specifics
than I have normally heard from a person being confirmed,''
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told Mrs. Hills as the
panel prepared to vote. ``They usually fudge their answers more.''
   Mrs. Hills also vowed that she and her attorney husband would
each take measures to make certain that she would never be faced
with a conflict of interest in her new role as the nation's top
trade negotiator. She said she would divest herself of any business
ties that could raise such a problem.
   Mrs. Hills stressed that she would ``not hesitate to act when
necessary and appropriate to fight unfair trade practices of foreign
governments.''
   ``Retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy,'' she said. ``In
fact, it signals the failure of our efforts to open foreign markets.
But the credible threat of retaliation provides essential leverage
in our market-opening efforts. Thus, actual retaliation will be
used, albeit reluctantly, to preserve the credibility of of this
threat.''
   At another point, Mrs. Hills said she would prefer to settle
trade dispute with a handshake and a deal. But she said that when
negotiations fail to do the job she will not hesitate to retaliate
and open markets ``with a crowbar if necessary.''
   Mrs. Hills, a Californian, served in the Ford administration as
secretary of housing and urban development. She has been practicing
law in Washington since then. When she was named to the trade
representative's post, Bentsen issued a statement saying he had
hoped for someone with more experience in problems of global markets.
   Before the committee, however, Mrs. Hills impressed senators with
her detailed knowledge of complex issues ranging from plywood trade
between the United States and Canada to American complaints about
European government subsidies for the jetliner manufacturer Airbus
Industrie.
   ``I think you are going to be a terrific trade representative,''
Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., told her.
   She also made a point of living up to her advance billing by
supporters as a tough negotiator.
   ``Make no mistake,'' declared Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., ``this
is a gentle lady, but this lady has the guts of a lion.''
   ``We have to have our agreements enforced,'' Mrs. Hills
testified. ``And where our partners are violating our agreements we
must take action.''
   ``Were I to say one thing to the Japanese today, it is: we must
have results,'' she said at another point.

<HEAD>President Loose in First News Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first news conference of his presidency,
George Bush today engaged in an upbeat, at times jocular
give-and-take with reporters, interjecting his own ideas on the
format.
   Although Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced the surprise
news conference would run for 15 or 20 minutes, the president stood
before the White House press corps for about 45 minutes, apparently
comfortable fielding questions on a wide variety of topics.
   Bush's appearance was not scheduled and produced scrambling by
camera crews, reporters and photographers when it was announced on
15 minutes' notice.
   At one point, he interupted the questioning to ask about the
customary practice of allowing for follow-up questions by each
reporter after the president answers the initial question.
   In an exchange that produced much laughter, Bush stopped after a
question on the minimum wage and said, ``Wait, let me ask you to
stop the proceedings.''
   He turned to Fitzwater and said nodding to the assembled
reporters, ``Don't take it out of their time.''
   ``What would be the fair and noble way to handle follow-up
questions as we do these things? Would it be good to have them or
not have them?'' he asked.
   Some reporters replied that follow-ups are needed when the
president doesn't fully answer a question.
   ``You mean my first answer is less than precise,'' Bush said to
chuckles.
   He then noted with a gesture toward the reporters lined up along
the side of the room that with the seated journalists _ who tend to
be called on first _ getting two questions, ``the standees have
gotten no time at all.''

   Three black legislators abruptly left the Senate
chamber Friday when a beauty queen sang ``Dixie.''
   Sens. Arthur Langford, Horace Tate and Gary Parker quickly filed
out a side door at the beginning of the performance by Lisa Ray,
niece of Sen. Walter Ray and winner of the Miss Georgia Sweet Potato
Queen contest.
   Langford confirmed that the senators left because of the song,
which is associated with the Confederacy.
   Another black senator, Eugene Walker, was not on the Senate floor
when the performance began and said he chose not to come back until
Miss Ray finished singing.
   ``I don't have a problem with others listening to it,'' Walker
said. ``I just don't want to listen to it.''
   Ray said there was no political significance to his niece's
choice of songs. ``It was just the song she sang in the talent
contest,'' he said.

   Authorities plan to ban sale of
alcoholic drinks at sports events and other public gatherings to
combat alcoholism, an official report said Friday.
   The ban will be included in a law expected to be adopted in
March, an official of the city's largest anti-drug research center
said.
   ``This law has been discussed ever since the late 1970s, but each
time there was somebody who didn't like it,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity.
   The ban will include sale of alcoholic beverages at cultural
events and dances, according to the official CTK news agency's
broadcast Friday.
   Authorities are also considering a ban on public smoking on
trains and sale of tobacco products to youngsters under 16, CTK said.
   Czechoslovakia, a country of 15.5 million, has 51,313 officially
registered alcoholics, an increase of 26 percent in seven years, the
agency said.

   Searchers found the body of a neo-fascist
senator along railroad tracks in Tuscany on Friday after his family
reported him missing, news agencies reported.
   The family of Sen. Mario Biagioni was expecting him home Monday
after a late-night train ride from Rome, the ANSA news agency
reported. Police later found his briefcase on the train at the end
of the line in Turin, the AGI news agency said.
   AGI quoted investigators as saying there was no immediate

   Biagioni, 57, joined the Italian Social Movement party, a
neo-fascist group, in the 1950s. He was elected to the Senate in
1987.

   The Burundi government freed six people who
last year accused the army of summarily executing Hutu tribe members
during ethnic clashes, a state-owned radio reported Friday.
   Radio Burundi, in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi, did not
identify the six people who it said were released Thursday, but it
said they belonged to the majority Hutu tribe.
   In August, Hutu in two northern communities of this East African
nation attacked Tutsi neighbors.
   The predominantly Tutsi army was sent to restore order but turned
against the Hutu. At least 5,000 people died and an estimated 50,000
fled to neighboring Rwanda.
   Government opponents say 17 people were arrested for accusing the
army of the executions in a letter last year to President Pierre
Buyoya of Burundi. The radio denied that charge.

   President Joseph Momoh appealed to

   In a speech Thursday to governing party delegates in Makeni, the

wicked saboteurs'' and others guilty of wrongdoing.
   Sierra Leone suffers from shortages of consumer goods and soaring
prices for rice, its staple food. In 1987, the government declared a
state of economic emergency, still in effect, that imposed stiff
penalties for smuggling, fraud, and mismanagement of public funds.

<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case said today he
has the authority to compel President Bush and former President
Reagan to testify at the trial of fired National Security Council
aide Oliver North.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell made the comment at a hearing
where the government argued that North's subpoenas served last month
for the testimony of Bush and Reagan should be quashed.
   Gesell said that if it becomes necessary to have the testimony of
either man at North's trial, it would be sought only as ``a last
resort.''
   ``As far as the power of the court to require testimony'' of
Reagan or Bush, ``I do not think there is any ... question,'' said
Gesell. He added that he thought the court's authority in such
situations is ``indisputable. ... The court has the power.''
   Gesell said such authority must be ``exercised with great
deference to the office of the president'' and should not be used
``except as a last resort if there is no other way to resolve the
issue.''
   Gesell didn't rule on the government's motion to quash the
subpoenas.
   Washington attorney Larry Simms, who sat in the spectator section
of the courtroom, acknowledged to reporters after the hearing that
he is representing Reagan.
   Simms said former Justice Department official Theodore Olson is
the lead attorney representing the former president.
   Meanwhile, Gesell said he had denied the request of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh for a subpoena to get spiral notebooks in
which North recorded his daily activities when he was at the NSC.
   North invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination in trying to avoid turning over the notebooks.
Gesell did not explain his denial.
   Walsh and Gesell are proceeding as though North will go on trial
next Tuesday, although those plans could be thrown off by an
interagency intelligence group in the Bush administration.
   The group, whose work led to the Jan. 13 dismissal of conspiracy
and theft charges against North, has been reviewing classified
documents that North's lawyers and prosecutors plan to present at
trial in connection with the 12 criminal charges that remain against
him.
   Two administration officials said today, however, that secrecy
problems would not block the trial.
   The interagency task force had identified some documents that
might pose problems if Gesell allowed their disclosure in open court
by the defense. A lot would depend, however, on Gesell's rulings
from the bench during the trial on the relevancy and admissability
of the documents, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Government secrecy specialists who are familiar with the
documents did not expect the sensitive material to be admitted into
evidence because it didn't appear relevant to the case, the
officials said.
   They said administration officials planned to closely monitor the
trial in the event there was an attempt by North's lawyers to
introduce into evidence documents that would compromise national
security.
   Gesell ruled in a Dec. 12 order that to ensure a fair trial for
North, there must be extensive disclosure by the prosecution from
the 300 classified documents it planned to use at trial, including
the verbatim text of many intelligence reports. That order and the
intelligence group's refusal to declassify many of the documents led
to Walsh's decision to seek dropping the conspiracy and theft counts
against North.
   Gesell issued a sealed order on Jan. 19 detailing how much must
be disclosed from the 300 classified documents North plans to use at
trial.
   North is accused of concealing from Congress and former Attorney
General Edwin Meese III his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan
Contras and of covering up the NSC's role in diverting money from
the Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors investigating alleged
wrongdoing under former President Chun Doo-hwan charged the nation's
former intelligence chief with corruption Friday and put him in
prison.
   Chang Se-dong, who was director of the Agency for National
Security Planning, was charged after two days of questioning.
   His arrest capped months of a government investigation into
alleged corruption and abuse of power under Chun's seven-year
authoritarian rule, which ended in February.
   Chang, 53, is the highest-ranking Chun official to be arrested.
   A legislator from the governing Democratic Justice Party and two
people who were Cabinet ministers under Chun were arrested on
corruption charges early this month.
   Last year, about a dozen members of Chun's family, including two
brothers, were convicted or charged with taking bribes and
embezzling millions of dollars.
   Chang, a former army general, was one of the most powerful men in
the nation under Chun. He played a major role in enforcing Chun's
tough rule and suppressing opposition.
   Prosecutors said Chang denied wrongdong, insisting that he just
followed presidential orders. Chang was head of Chun's presidential
security before serving as intelligence chief from 1985 to 1987.
   Prosecutor-General Kim Gi-chun indicated Chang's arrest marked an
end to the investigation.
   ``In the probe, we did our best. There were no preset limitations
to our investigation. All people found involved were sent to
prison,'' he told reporters.
   The charges against Chang are vague and relatively mild. They
include illegal construction of a guest house, which critics say was
to be used as Chun's office-mansion after retirement, and illegal
use of government office space.
   South Korean press reports said prosecutors had difficulty
finding hard evidence to use against Chang.
   The inquiry into Chun's government has dominated South Korean
politics for months, with opposition groups demanding the arrest of
Chang and several other former top Chun aides on human rights abuses.
   The opposition contends President Roh Tae-woo's government is not
making sufficient efforts to prosecute former Chun aides. Roh, a
former general and once a close ally of Chun, is closely identified
with the ex-president in the eyes of many South Koreans.
   Chun took power with military backing in 1980. Roh won
presidential elections in December 1987 and took office in February.
   In November, Chun apologized to the nation for abuses under his
rule and went into rural exile at a remote east coast Buddhist
monastery.

   Striking Iberia airlines jet mechanics blame
leftist unions as much as managers for the dispute that has caused
the company to trim about 100 flights a day, a mechanics' union
official said Friday.
   The mechanics' union mounted its ninth 24-hour strike since Dec.
23 on Friday.
   Union official Ramses Rodriguez said the mechanics are trying to
pressure Iberia to train them to meet international specifications.
They fear they could lose their jobs in 1993 when the European
Economic Community is to take steps to unify the labor pool and
establish common job norms.
   Rodriguez said, however, that communist- and socialist-led unions
representing most of the company's 21,000 ground employees failed to
include the point in collective bargaining. He said the mechanics
want separate talks to include their retraining in a larger pact
with the company.
   Iberia has estimated strike losses at $30.6 million.

   The government has proposed a new tunnel for the
first direct east-west rail link across London in a $6.3 billion
plan to alleviate subway congestion.
   The Central London Rail Study, released Thursday, also proposed a
north-south train link connecting King's Cross and Victoria stations.
   The new lines were proposed to divert passengers from some of the
most crowded parts of the subway, known as the Underground.
   It carries 2.2 million fares per day, including 200,000 who reach
London by British Rail. Rush-hour traffic on the Underground has
increased 50 percent since 1982.
   The new east-west line would connect Paddington station with
Liverpool Street station.

   A meter maid today discovered a dead man
slumped in a parked van near City Hall, where it had collected
several parking tickets since the man's death days before, police
said.
   The man was slumped against the door in the front passenger's
seat, with some medication on the seat next to him, Sgt. Steve
Pacheco said. There was no sign of foul play, and the man, who was
in his 60s, was the registered owner of the van.
   The man, whose identity was withheld until relatives were
notified, had been dead several days, Pacheco said. On the van's
windshield were parking tickets dating back to Tuesday.
   Lt. Charles Owen said an internal inquiry of methods and
procedures would be conducted.
   ``Again, the meter maids are not commissioned police officers,''
Owen said. ``They are civilians and that too will be considered.
Outside of being a trained observer, we don't really expect them to
make any type of investigations.''

   Jack Kemp, housing secretary-designate, told a
Senate committee today it will take more than government aid to
solve problems of the homeless, and another panel approved the
nomination of Carla Hills as trade representative.
   ``Funding, while necessary, is not sufficient,'' the former New
York Republican congressman told the Senate Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee, which was holding his confirmation hearing. ``We
need to work together to provide a complete and effective safety
net'' with both public and private efforts.
   In written statements, Kemp pledged to work toward making home
ownership possible for people in public housing, to press for urban
enterprise zones to encourage inner city development, and to seek a
national housing policy that will make housing more affordable for
poor and young families.
   His hearing was interrupted by six members of the Community for
Creative Non-Violence, an advocate for the homeless, who shouted
accusations that the nominee was partly responsible for the
reduction in affordable housing available for low-income Americans.
   Also facing questioning today was Mrs. Hills, who quickly won
approval for the post of U.S. trade representative from the Senate
Finance Committee on an 18-0 vote. ``You have done well and you have
answered with more specifics than I have normally heard from a
person being confirmed,'' Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
told Mrs. Hills.
   Former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, Bush's choice for defense
secretary, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that
it is ``unrealistic'' to believe that the Star Wars missile defense
system could protect all of America from nuclear attack.
   Bush's selection to be his chief economic adviser, Michael
Boskin, told the Senate Banking Committee that savings can be found
in military and health care programs as the administration tries to
hold next year's federal deficit to $100 billion.
   And former Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr., R-N.M., testified to the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee that if confirmed as Bush's
interior secretary, he will try to leave the country's natural
resources in a ``better condition than we found them.''
   Tower's comments on Star Wars represented a break from Reagan
administration descriptions of the program as capable of providing
an extensive shield against nuclear attack.
   ``I don't believe that we can devise (an) umbrella that can
protect the entire American population from nuclear incineration. I
think that's unrealistic,'' Tower said.
   Tower, who from 1981 to 1984 chaired the armed services panel,
also told the committee that he would ``bend over backwards'' to
avoid favoring his former military contractor associates, from whom
he earned $763,777 over the last three years.
   He said he ended his relationship with the weapons industry on
Dec. 1, a day after learning he was under serious consideration for
the Pentgon post. He said he did not ``stand to gain from the
prosperity of any former associate.''
   But Tower was told by chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., that his
situation did pose problems because he had been involved with as
many as seven major military contractors.
   Discussing the Defense Department's $300 billion budget, Tower
said ``nothing is sacred'' when it comes to saving money. He said
Bush had yet to decide where any savings from the Pentagon's coffers
would come.
   Boskin told the banking panel that Bush will reveal specific
budget proposals in an address to a joint session of Congress on
Feb. 9.
   Boskin, a Stanford University economics professor, is the creator
of Bush's flexible freeze plan, under which total federal spending
would grow no faster than the inflation rate. Bush has claimed that
with that constraint, the budget can be balanced by 1993 with no tax
increases, an assertion that critics claim would work only if the
economy performs at unexpectedly good levels.
   Bush has never stated precisely how he would keep spending in
check, and Boskin offered no new specifics to the senators.
   ``If there are no new taxes, that means there will have to be
some massive cuts in the federal budget,'' said Sen. Larry Pressler,
R-S.D., who repeatedly asked Boskin to specify ``three or four
areas'' where spending reductions should be made.
   Boskin, who emphasized that Bush has not made any final decisions
on the budget, said he would personally favor reducing the growth
rate of military spending and government-paid health benefits.
   ``If I were looking for large savings, they would have to come
from areas where there is large spending,'' Boskin said.
   Lujan, Bush's choice to be interior secretary, told the energy
committee that he considers the job to be a ``stewardship,'' and
said he would seek thousands of volunteers as helpers in the
national park and fish and wildlife systems.
   He quoted the late President Roosevelt in saying, ``The country
will not be a good place to live in unless it is a good place for
all of us to live in.''
   ``We want to be known as a team who passed on these national
treasures in better condition than we found them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bronfman Urges Soviet Jewish Emigres to Head to Israel, Not United
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the World Jewish
Congress said Friday that more Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union
should go to Israel, rather than the United States.
   Edgar M. Bronfman also said West German leaders promised they
would cooperate with international efforts against a Libyan plant
the United States says is intended for making poison gas.
   In an interview, Bronfman said the number of Soviet Jewish
emigres has increased vastly. In 1986, only 681 were permitted to
leave. More liberal policies allowed that number to jump to 20,000
in 1988.
   Soviet Jews leave with travel documents for Israel and travel to
Vienna, where many seek permission to resettle in the United States.
They then head to facilities in Ladispoli town outside Rome and
often wait weeks for a decision on their applications.
   ``They should go to Israel, or more of them should go to
Israel,'' said Bronfman. ``Now, it's a real strain on the U.S.
economy.''
   The American businessman said it costs $7,000 to resettle each of
the Soviet Jews in the United States.
   He noted that Soviet Jewish emigres have refugee status when they
leave.
   ``(But) most of the Soviet Jews who are leaving now are not
physically threatened. It's difficult to call them refugees,'' said
Bronfman.
   In September, the United States for the first time began
rejecting Soviet Jews for refugee status, with the current rejection
rate running at about 21 percent, according to Karl Zukerman of the
Hebrew Immigration Aid Society in New York.
   Bronfman said he wanted to avoid saying the United States had
``tightened'' its official policies regarding Soviet Jews, but
rather that Washington had ``largely ignored'' various restrictions
when the numbers were small.
   Bronfman spoke at length about his talks this week with West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher regarding the plant in Rapta, Libya, which the United
States says is being built to produce chemical weapons with help
from West German companies.
   Bronfman said German leaders assured him that legal penalties
will be increased for cases of illegal arms and arms-related exports.
   He said most importantly, the West Germans agreed to cooperate
with their allies to ensure the plant cannot produce poison gas.
   ``The teeth of the tiger will be pulled so that the plant cannot
produce poison gas,'' Bronfman said. ``How that's going to be done,
I did't get into that. I will be more satisfied when the world is
assured that Libya cannot produce chemical weapons.''
   The Libyan government denies the charges and maintains the plant
is a pharmaceutical complex.
   Bronfman called alleged West German involvement an example of
``greed overcoming common sense.''

<HEAD>Caller In Danger, Deputy Tells Him To Have Nice Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARITA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An emergency call from a man who
reported a shooting, a bleeding victim and fear for his own life was
answered by a 911 dispatcher who hung up after telling the caller to
have a nice day.
   The conversation was being investigated by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, Capt. Robert Spierer said Thursday. He said
the results of an internal investigation would not be released.
   The conversation occurred at 10:36 p.m. on Jan. 20, after a
gang-related shooting.
   A man identified as Jim Finnila made the call to Deputy Jim Green
on the 911 emergency line to report a shooting. Miguel Jiminez, 15,
of Newhall had been shot and died a short time later at a hospital.
Alphonso Tapia, 19, a suspected gang member, was booked for
investigation of murder, police said.
   In a transcript of the call released Thursday, Finnila tells
Green there was a shooting and pleads with him to ``get the cops
here quick.''
   After a short exchange, in which Finnila says he's in danger,
Green asks: ``Are you gonna talk to me?''
   ``Yeah. And I'm scared to death,'' Finnila says.
   The conversation continues.
   Green: ``All right. Has anybody been shot? Yes or no?''
   Finnila: ``I don't know. I don't know.''
   Green: ``What have you got there? What the hell are you yelling
about?''
   Finnila: ``Come on and get some squad cars over here.''
   Green: ``No. I ain't getting nobody nowhere unless you talk to
me. You want to talk to me?''
   Finnila: ``I'm going to get killed. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's blood
everywhere. There's blood from his head. Oh damn. Get a deputy.''
   Green: ``Hey. Have a nice day. OK?''
   Finilla: ``Oh. Come on. Come on ...''
   ``I'm not going to speculate whether what he did was proper,''
Spierer said at a news conference. Another call about the shooting
had been received seconds earlier and a squad car was sent to the
area about four minutes later.
   Six squad cars eventually arrived and what was believed to be the
murder weapon was recovered, he said.
   Green hung up ``when the caller was uncooperative, when he didn't
answer the questions Deputy Green wanted answered,'' Spierer said.
He was also concerned that he was tying up a 911 line when others
with more and better information might be trying to get through,
Spierer said.

<HEAD>Educators Ask: Can School Shootings Be Stopped?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educators are taking a new look at school
security in light of the latest student shootings, but most say even
the tightest precautions won't shield pupils from would-be killers
in all cases.
   ``You can set up the procedures; you can have detection systems;
you can reinforce the rules for entering a school building. But
still it's very difficult to offer the kind of airtight protection
that students need,'' said Gary Marx, a spokesman for the American
Association of School Administrators.
   Some officials are calling for greater restrictions on sales of
weapons, particularly automatic rifles, after last week's killings
in a Stockton, Calif., elementary school yard. A gunman, Patrick
Purdy, murdered five children and wounded 30 people using an AK-47
assault rifle before killing himself, police say.
   ``It's not fair to say there's nothing you can do,'' said Bill
Honig, superintendent of the California school system. ``But it's
pretty hard to do something about this kind of guy. He was going to
get into the school somehow. Even with an armed guard, he would have
just shot past him.''
   He added: ``The crime is that these weapons are around. How many
more innocent children are going to have to die before you decide to
do something about the availability of weapons of war?''
   Nevertheless, Honig said school personnel have been told to
``beef up vigilance'' and he said he expects Gov. George Deukmeijian
to sign a bill this year requiring every school to have a safety
plan. He vetoed it last year on cost grounds.
   Police officers, security guards and even metal detectors are
common sights at some high schools and middle schools besieged by
drug and gang related violence. But concern is now extending to
elementary schools, which are increasingly common targets of
violence.
   In the past year, for example, a 19-year-old man killed two
8-year-olds and wounded seven pupils and two teachers at Oakland
Elementary School in Greenwood, S.C. Laurie Dann shot and killed an
8-year-old and wounded five other children at Hubbard Woods
Elementary School in Winnetka, Ill., before wounding an adult and
killing herself.
   On Thursday in Washington, a gunman opened fire into a crowd of
high school students, wounding four, in an incident police said
apparently grew out of an earlier argument.
   Many educators worry about the expense, the effectiveness and the
psychological impact of turning schools into fortresses.
   ``The only way you could guarantee the safety of elementary
schools from the criminally insane would be to build them like
penitentiaries,'' said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of the
National School Boards Association. And that would be ``unacceptable
in terms of school environment, in terms of cost, in terms of
everything,'' he said.
   But Stuart Greenbaum, a spokesman for the National School Safety
Center in Malibu, Calif., said most parents want to see precautions
taken rather than hear officials say ``sorry, we don't want to make
it an armed camp.'' And he has some suggestions.
   Greenbaum, whose center was begun by the Reagan administration
and is financed by the Justice Department, said all schools should
have security officers or staff members responsible for security,
equipped with walkie-talkies or some way of communicating what they
see.
   Asked if that would have helped in Stockton, he replied, ``They
might have been able to report seeing somebody on or about the
campus with a gun, maybe prevented the situation from being as
dramatic as it was. Or in fact it may have even deterred the
individual from even coming on the campus.''
   Greenbaum said the Stockton gunman entered through a gate at the
back of the school grounds. ``You have to limit access points,'' he
said. ``This is not to say make the school a fortress. But if you
are obligated to have a variety of access points, they ought to be
monitored.''
   The recent outbreaks of school violence are prompting some
education groups to reconsider their historic reluctance to take
stands on gun control and other issues not directly related to
education.
   ``Concern is intensifying. Many schools and national
organizations at this point will be considering whether they should
have positions on some of these issues'' such as gun control, said
Marx of the administrators group.
   The school board association could approve a gun-control
resolution at its delegate meeting in April, Shannon said. ``School
board members didn't think gun control was terribly relevant,'' he
said. ``But now they're rethinking their positions.''
   The National Education Association, the country's largest teacher
union, has long supported gun control.

   President Bush said Friday he sees nothing
wrong with Ronald Reagan receiving large sums of money for his
memoirs, noting that other former presidents have done it. ``I don't
think it's ever been challenged as inappropriate,'' Bush said.
   Bernie Swain, a partner in the Washington Speakers Bureau, says
he has a ``handshake agreement'' to represent Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, as their exclusive lecture agents. He said terms had not been
settled, but other industry sources said the former president could
command fees of $40,000 or more per speech.
   Earlier, it was reported that Reagan will receive $5 million from
Simon &amp; Schuster for his memoirs and a book of speeches.
   Bush was asked at his news conference if he thought it was
``appropriate to cash in on the presidency.''
   ``I don't know whether I'd call it `cashing in.' I expect every
president has written his memoirs and received money for it,'' he
said.
   He said he had read that President Grant received $500,000 at a
time when ``half a million really meant something'' for his memoirs.
   ``So I think there's plenty of tradition that goes with
presidents writing memoirs and being paid for it,'' he said.
   Asked whether it might not create a wrong perception, the
president replied, ``No, because I think there's been a long history
of that. And, I don't think it's ever been challenged as
inappropriate.''
   Bush did not address the question of lecture fees.
   The president was also asked whether the emphasis he has placed
on government ethics during his first week in office implied any
criticism of the Reagan administration's ethical record. He said,
``No.''
   Bush said he has spoken out as he has on the issue ``because I
feel strongly about it.''
   Swain said he was in the process of signing Reagan up for his
speakers bureau and that most of the former president's speaking
engagements would be in the West, at least for now. The Reagans now
live in Los Angeles.
   Don Walker, president of the Harry Walker Agency in New York,
said his firm represent several speakers who get fees in the $40,000
range. But generally that amount is paid for speeches which require
travel.
   The Walker agency's clients include former Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, former President Ford and former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, among others.
   Swain said his firm had received requests in the past to arrange
speeches by Reagan while he was in office, but had referred all such
requests to the White House.
   He said Maureen Reagan, the president's daughter, and former
White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein had also been added to
the bureau's roster of speakers this week.

<TEXT>
   A Cabinet minister on Friday called for opening
talks with the PLO, and a newspaper said an aide to Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin met with a Palestinian leader on how to end the
uprising in the occupied lands.
   The Hebrew daily Maariv said Rabin adviser Shmuel Goren visited
Faisal Husseini, who is imprisoned at the Kfar Yonah prison in
central Israel, and that the two held a series of secret meetings on
political initiatives for restoring calm to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Reports on the talks were passed to top PLO leaders abroad, the
newspaper said.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber refused comment on the
reported meetings, which would mark a shift in the government's
policy of not talking with the Palestine Liberation Organization. It
considers the PLO a terrorist organization.
   Husseini is scheduled to be released from prison Sunday. He has
been held without trial most of the past 21 months, accused of
playing a role in the Palestinian uprising.
   Fuad Aref, an associate of Husseini, said he visited Husseini on
Monday and Husseini denied rumors of exploratory talks with Israeli
leaders.
   Science Minister Ezer Weizman told the Jerusalem Post it is time
for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to ``remove the taboo'' on
speaking with the PLO.
   ``You can't tell the other side who they should pick as their
representative,'' Weizman was quoted as saying of the Palestinians.
``Today the only party able to deliver what it promises in the
territories _ able to bring about an end to the rioting _ is the
PLO.''
   Weizman, a Labor Party leader and former defense minister, noted
the United States and European governments have opened talks with
the organization and said ``it's time we do so as well.''
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded 10
Palestinians in clashes with youths, according to Arab reports and
hospital officials. The army confirmed three shootings.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began 14 months ago, 369
Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.
   In addition, hundreds of Palestinians have been jailed under
administrative detention laws that allow detention for six months
without charge or trial.
   A tent city, set up by the 21st Year peace group near the Ketziot
prison in southern Negev desert, drew scores of peace activists who
listened to speeches, plays and demonstrations protesting the
detention policies.
   In one of the tents, Israeli artists set up a display of their
work, and a sign at the entrance read ``art under administrative
arrest,'' referring to the detention law.
   Ehud Barak, the army's deputy chief of staff, said this week
about 1,100 of Israel's 5,600 Palestinian prisoners are being held
in administrative detention. Many are believed held at the Ketziot
prison.

   Don't ask Anabel Thompson the names of her
great-grandchildren. She has 100 of them.
   ``I couldn't tell you,'' she said. ``I've never known anyone with
that many great-grandchildren.''
   Mrs. Thompson, who will turn 90 in March, grew up with seven
brothers and a sister, raised 12 children with her husband and has
61 grandchildren.
   With the arrival of Ben Thompson last month, she reached the
century mark in great-grandchildren.
   ``The ones who live here come by to see me all the time,'' Mrs.
Thompson said. ``The ones who live out of town I usually see in the
summertime. I love my great-grandchildren as much as my own
children.''
   ``All the grandkids come to mother for advice and confide in her
a lot,'' said Patsy Clayton, one of Mrs. Thompson's daughters.
   ``Daddy always talked about throwing a rock in the water and
watching it ripple and ripple. That's how I think about all the
great-grandchildren.''
   A family reunion is planned in July. If Mrs. Thompson is able to
go, young Ben Thompson probably won't be the youngest she sees.
Great-grandchildren numbers 101, 102, and 103 are on the way.

   The Mount McSauba ski resort says its
problem wasn't that prices were too high but that they were too low.
   ``Downstaters would call, ask our rates, laugh and hang up,''
said Ike Boss, recreation director. ``They thought any hill that
only charged $3.50 for skiing must be a piece of junk.''
   So operators doubled the lift ticket price to $7, and
out-of-towners have begun using the hill more frequently.
   Boss said he had to raise prices after Mount McSauba suffered
losses for years. But some local skiers said it's now difficult to
afford a day on the slopes.
   ``If you have a 7-year-old and a 4-year-old, as I do, I have to
spend $21, even though my 4-year-old cannot last longer than two
hours,'' said Lauri Wilson.

   The Suburban Rotary Club moved this weekend's Arctic Open to a

and 50s and melted the course.
   A nine-hole course was to be fashioned on Wehrspann Lake, with
hundreds of discarded Christmas trees lining the course.
   The Rotary club and the tournament co-sponsors, Wendy's fast-food
restaurants, hope to raise about $20,000 for scholarships for
handicapped students.
   One foresome planning to attend consists of politicians more
accustomed to teeing off on each other than teeing off together:
former Mayor Mike Boyle and three mayoral candidates, including City
Councilman Jim Cleary.
   Cleary, who invited the others to join him in a foursome, was
spokesman for a citizens group that recalled Boyle from office two
years ago.
   Boyle has not ruled out another try for the office.

   A couple inspired by a mayoral candidate's
offer to buy assault rifles went out and bought 13 of them, then
turned them in to be resold to the politician at a loss, officials
said.
   In nearby Compton, the city council voted to ban the powerful
semiautomatic weapons outright.
   ``We're happy to have them off the streets,'' said Sgt. Mike
Miskowiec, at the Los Angeles Police Department's southwest
division, where a man and woman brought in 13 AK-47 assault rifles
Thursday evening.
   ``They went out and purchased 13 of these guns and brought them
down to us,'' he said.
   Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden, who is running for mayor,
announced Tuesday that he would buy semiautomatic assault rifles for
up to $300, using $50,000 from a political action committee fund.
Counting the 13 brought in by the unidentified couple, and seven
more bought and brought in by a real estate agency, the number of
weapons turned in stood at 36 Thursday.
   The Compton vote and Holden's offer in Los Angeles came in the
wake of the Jan. 17 massacre at a Stockton schoolyard in which
drifter Patrick Edward Purdy opened fire on students with an AK-47.
He killed five children and wounded 29 others and one teacher before
taking his own life.
   In Compton, the ban on the sale or possession of AK-47s and other
semiautomatic weapons was passed by the City Council on Tuesday. It
is scheduled to take effect Feb. 19.
   ``It was time for somebody to take the first step,'' said
Councilman Maxcy Filer, who wrote the ordinance. ``What we're trying
to do is get guns off the streets and out of the hands of
criminals.''
   Some Compton officials have expressed concern the ordinance won't
survive a constitutional challenge, however, and the National Rifle
Association's office in Washington, D.C., has vowed to fight it.
   Compton, a city of 96,000 located 12 miles south of downtown Los
Angeles, has one of the highest murder rates in the area. It
recorded 80 killings in 1987, one for every 1,200 residents,
according to FBI statistics.
   Holden rejected criticism that his effort is a publicity stunt
for his campaign to unseat four-term Mayor Tom Bradley in the April
election.
   Miskowiec refused to name the couple who brought in the 13 guns
and said he didn't know why they made the purchase. New AK-47s
generally range in price from about $300 to $1,500 for a customized
version, according to gun dealers.
   Among the AK-47s turned in Thursday were seven bought by a San
Fernando Valley real estate office for more than $2,500.
   ``We just decided to go ahead and get these things off the
street,'' said Jeffrey Fox, an office employee. He called it a
symbolic action.
   One woman had an AK-47 stolen out of her car Thursday when she
stopped at a gas station on the way to turn it in, Miskowiec said.

   President Bush said Friday his first week in
office had been ``wonderfully harmonious,'' but conceded rougher
times loom ahead.
   Seven days almost to the hour after his inauguration, Bush was
still basking in the newsness of the job at his first full-fledged
news conference.
   ``I'm just getting a preview of coming attractions. And it's been
lovely,'' Bush said, adding, ``It's going to change and I know it.''
   He sloughed off questions about some of the rough spots of the
first week, including the furor over a Treasury Department proposal
for a depositor fee and renewed controversy over the abortion views
of Dr. Louis Sullivan, his nominee for secretary of health and human
services.
   ``I think it's been a wonderfully harmonious week. And these are
just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond,'' Bush
said.
   The president's news conference concluded a week rich in
symbolism but relatively lean of substance.
   That, Bush said, was the point of the first week, calling it a
time for setting ``a certain tone and outreach.''
   ``There'll be plenty of time for controversy, plenty of time for
lively debate on substance,'' he told reporters.
   In his first week, Bush called world leaders, including Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev; held a concilatory meeting with a
bipartisan delegation from Congress; set up a commission to recomend
an ethics code for government officials, and hammered the ethics
theme home in talks before various governmental groups.
   The White House also announced Bush would travel to Canada,
Japan, China and South Korea and said Japan's prime minister, Noburo
Takeshita, would visit here next week.
   Was Bush concerned that he would be criticzied for not having
much ``meat behind the words?''
   ``There is a danger of that. But people realize we've been here
five days,'' Bush said, referring to working days.
   He defended anew his decision to undertake a thorough review of
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``People ... understand that in things like the foreign policy
area, it's prudent to have a review. They understand that we've got
to get our people in place.
   ``We'll just go forward,'' he added. ``If we just sat around and
did nothing but be pleasant to people on the Hill or something, ...
I suspect that would grow a little old.''
   And he said he was sticking by his HHS secretary-designate,
disputing statements that Sullivan had disagreed with Bush's
conviction that the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion
should be overturned. ``We are in sync,'' Bush declared.
   And he quickly distanced himself from the much-criticized
proposal of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to charge depositors a
fee to shore up the nation's ailing savings and loan industry. Bush
said that the proposal hadn't even made it to his desk yet and it's
``a little absurd'' to be commmenting on it at this stage.
   Overall, Bush said, ``It's been a good easy week _ and I expect
it will change dramatically in the weeks ahead.''
   While claiming the week had been marred by a head cold, he said
he still planned to ``smile and enjoy it while you can.''
   ``Because I can already sense, you know, looking forward, a
little more confrontation out there.''

   Ilona Staller, Italy's porn star parliamentarian
known as Cicciolina, bared her breasts in front of the U.S.
Consulate on Friday after failing to obtain a visa to perform in San
Francisco.
   As photographers snapped away on Via Veneto, the 37-year-old Ms.
Staller opened her coat and blouse and held up a sign saying, in
Italian, ``Why is the United States afraid of Cicciolina's breasts?''
   ``This isn't the end. I am not giving up,'' said Ms. Staller, who
has been invited to perform in the O'Farrell Theater in San
Francisco. The Hungarian-born Ms. Staller has been trying for weeks
to obtain a U.S. visa.
   Embassy spokesman Mark Dillen said her application was under
review. He declined to give any reason for the delay, but it is
believed to stem from her failure to list her arrests on the
application.
   She has been arrested on obscenity charges several times, and on
Wednesday was convicted of public obscenity.

been convicted of trespassing at the pop superstar's mansion.
   Lavon A. Muhammad, who also says Jackson fathered her 6-year-old

trespassing and violating a court order to stay more than 100 yards
from Jackson's Encino property.
   The woman, who calls herself Billie Jean Jackson, allegedly has
harassed Jackson for five years, leading to a 1986 restraining order.
   Jackson's song ``Billie Jean,'' about a man denying a paternity

   ``He brought a woman up from the audience and was dancing around

   When Brown left the stage, Sgt. Bobby Horne, head of security at

   The city ordinance prohibits performers at an event attended by
people under age 18 to show nudity or sexual pictures or models or
to use ``four-letter sexual words.''
   Brown was booked at the jail and was back on stage about an hour

   ``This is a very interesting problem and a very interesting

<HEAD>Bush Says He and Greenspan Have Similar Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday that Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan worries more than he does about
inflation right now, but that otherwise their views are similar.
   ``Basically and generally speaking, I think we're fairly close
together,'' Bush said at his first presidential news conference.
   Bush was asked about what appeared to be a disagreement between
himself and the Fed over its policy on interest rates.
   Greenspan earlier this week told Congress that the risk of higher
inflation was great enough that the Fed should ``err more on the
side of restrictiveness than of stimulus'' in setting interest rate
and credit policy.
   The Fed has been gradually tightening credit, pushing up
short-term interest rates, in recent months to keep the economy from
overheating.
   Bush, however, said this week that he didn't want the Fed to
``move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth.''
   Greenspan ``is more concerned about inflationary pressures than I
am right now. Seems to me, there's an area of difference,'' Bush
said Friday.
   Bush said one cause of Greenspan's concern appeared to be recent
statistics showing that the nation's factories were operating at
82.4 percent of capacity last month _ the highest level in nine
years.
   Many economists have suggested that the high level of factory
utilization, combined with an unemployment rate at a 14-year low of
5.3 percent, could soon combine to force up the price of
manufactured goods.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds News-Free Press Joint Operating Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals today cleared the way
for the partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers, the Free
Press and the News.
   In a 2-1 decision, the court said a ruling last year by
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III approving the joint operating
agreement of the two newspapers was ``based on a permissible
construction'' of the Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The act creates an exemption to the antitrust laws that permits a
joint arrangement between two newspapers if the attorney general
determines that one of the two papers is ``a failing newspaper'' and
in probable danger of financial failure.
   The appeals court said Meese's application of the legal standard
to the facts in the case ``was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse
of discretion.''
   ``Congress ... delegated to the attorney general, not to us, the
delicate and troubling responsibility of putting content into the
ambiguous phrase, `probable danger of financial failure,''' the
appeals court ruling said. ``We cannot say that his interpretation
of that phrase ... was unreasonable.''
   The ruling affirmed a decision in September by U.S. District
Judge George Revercomb. He rejected contentions by a group of
Detroit advertisers and readers that the morning Free Press, owned
by Knight-Ridder Inc., was not a failing newspaper entitled to
antitrust exemptions under the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act.
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to close the Free Press if the joint
operating agreement is not approved. The News is owned by Gannett
Co. Inc.
   Consolidating the two newspapers' business, advertising,
circulation and production departments would result in layoffs of
between 600 and 800 employees _ compared with the loss of 2,200 jobs
if the Free Press were shut down.

<HEAD>Report AIDS Outbreak Among Hospitalized Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nurses using tainted syringes infected 27 children
at a hospital with the AIDS virus, the largest single outbreak of
the deadly disease in the Soviet Union, a newspaper reported Friday.
   In an expose headlined ``Diagnosis: Syringe,'' the labor daily
Trud said ``criminal negligence'' was suspected at the republican
children's hospital in Elista, in southern Russia.
   Authorities discovered the outbreak in November when a child and
a woman blood donor from the hospital were found to have AIDS.
   The Soviet Union only recently has admitted to an AIDS problem
and started diagnosis, treatment and prevention programs.
   Authorities discovered that a son of the woman blood donor had
died after treatment in the same hospital as the AIDS-infected
child, and began testing other children and mothers there, Trud
said. Of 300 people screened, 27 children _ most under 2 _ and four
mothers were found to have AIDS.
   The women apparently contracted the virus from their children,
through breastfeeding, Trud said. It said the mothers' nipples must
have cracked and the infants passed the virus on to them. Such a
method of transmission has not been identified previously, according
to the newspaper.
   Anne Sims, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta, said AIDS specialists there consider it highly unlikely
that infants could give AIDS to their mothers through breastfeeding.
The CDC knows of only one case of an infant giving AIDS to its
mother, Sims said, but that transmission occurred through blood.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   More tests are planned on 1,000 children at the hospital, as well
as on patients at other facilities where the children also had been
treated, Trud said.
   Vadim V. Pokrovsky, head of the AIDS laboratory of the Central
Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology in Moscow, said the
number of AIDS cases traced to the Elista hospital could double or
triple as tests continue.
   ``If measures aren't taken to control infection by instruments,
the disease could spread,'' Pokrovsky said on the TV news program
``Vremya.''
   The infected patients were carrying the disease but had not shown
symptoms and none had died, he said.
   ``An unprecedented situation has been created in the republic in
which during two months more than 30 carriers of the virus have been
revealed,'' Pokrovsky said.
   He told Trud an investigation will determine who was responsible.
   The Council of Ministers warned in 1987 that infecting someone
with AIDS would be punished as a crime and said anyone in the
country could be forced to take an AIDS test. Under a new regulation
that take effect next month, foreigners who want to stay more than
three months will have to prove they are AIDS-free.
   The newspaper said hospital staff had violated all sanitary
rules. Log books that were supposed to contain records of payments
for syringes were either missing or blank. Some 14 percent of
instruments used last year were not sterilized as required, Trud
reported.
   Disposable syringes are in short supply in the Soviet Union.
Glass syringes are used most frequently after sterilization in
boiling water. Trud said the two agencies responsible for producing
syringes had made only excuses for the shortage and admitted they
were turning to foreign companies for supplies.
   Trud said the incident eroded confidence in the Soviet medical
system.
   ``Probably no doctor is better than a bad doctor,'' the newspaper
said.
   It also lashed out at the Soviet Union for not taking more active
measures against AIDS.
   ``We are still not prepared for a serious battle against it,''
Trud said.
   Instead of combatting the virus, Soviet doctors engage in an
``ideological battle'' to blame the spread of AIDS on the West, it
said. It quoted one official as writing that ``the roots of
distribution are the American and Western ways of life,
irrepressible and prospering homosexuality.''
   Last year, the first Soviet AIDS deaths were reported: a
4-month-old baby from Odessa apparently infected by its mother, and
a 29-year-old Leningrad prostitute. Tests identified 112 Soviets and
334 foreign residents carrying the human immunodeficiency virus. Of
them, five foreigners and three Soviets have contracted the disease.

   A newborn and his family were back
together Friday after a nurse on maternity leave was arrested on
suspicion of kidnapping the boy on the pretext of returning him to
the hospital for a blood test.
   Six-day-old Henry Garcia was taken from his parents' home
Wednesday by a woman in a white uniform, wearing a stethoscope and
claiming to be a Valley Medical Center nurse.
   He was found safe 15 hours later after detectives traced
Catherine Anne Garrigan through a trail of telephone numbers left
with the baby's family, police said.
   Authorities said Garrigan, a registered nurse on leave from the
center since mid-December, apparently obtained numbers for Garcia's
family through the hospital and called the relatives after the
mother and child were released Sunday.
   Police were investigating the possibility that Garrigan had
recently suffered a miscarriage, said Lt. Sam Pearson.
   The baby's mother, 27-year-old Margarita Regalado, who has lived
in United States for eight years and speaks little English, said a
friend received a call from a woman claiming to be a nurse. Regalado
doesn't have a telephone.
   The nurse said ``she had to see the baby because they forgot to
do a blood test and she wanted to talk to me or see me,'' said the
new mother, adding that she and her husband thought the hospital may
have forgotten to perform the test.
   She said the nurse arrived at their home, checked the baby's
heartbeat and asked if he had a cough.
   ``She said she would take him for three hours and then would
return,'' said Regalado.
   As soon as the nurse had gone, Regalado said, she suspected the
baby had been stolen. The family called the hospital, which said it
had not sent a nurse.
   Pearson said detectives traced the baby to Garrigan and a friend,
Ismael Perez, 31, through phone numbers left with the newborn's
relatives. Ringing a Santa Clara number, police heard a baby crying
in the background, police said.
   They kept the woman on the phone while officers were dispatched.
There they arrested Perez and Garrigan and found the baby.
   Garrigan and Perez were booked Thursday for investigation of
conspiracy and kidnapping. Bail was set at $50,000 each. Perez
posted bail Thursday.

<TEXT>
   John Tower, the U.S. defense
secretary-designate, arrived Friday for a strategy session with NATO
allies in which he will warn of a possible Kremlin ploy to weaken
the Western alliance.
   Tower took a break from Senate confirmation hearings to address
the 26th annual conference of policymakers from the 16 NATO members.
He is expected to be confirmed.
   ``I find this to be a very interesting and productive conference
because of the frankness of the exchange of views,'' Tower told The
Associated Press upon arrival. He has attended all but one of the
previous 25 meetings.
   Tower apparently was referring to the sometimes volatile
exchanges that take place at the sessions delving into defense
strategy, arms control and fair distribution of security costs and
burdens.
   Tower refused further comment on his expectations for the session
on grounds he is ``embargoed from giving interviews until
confirmation.''
   But copies of a speech Tower is to deliver Sunday were released
Friday. In it, Tower restates his support for ``modernizing,'' or
extending European-based short-range missiles now capable of
striking as far away as 300 miles.
   ``Continued wrangling and delays only provide the Soviet Union
with an opportunity to try to undermine NATO unity,'' he says,
referring to debates among Europeans about the need for and wisdom
of modifying the missiles to effectively replace medium-range
rockets being withdrawn from Europe under the superpower treaty
signed in 1987.
   Tower makes several references in the address to what he
perceives as a possible Kremlin ploy to enhance differences among
the Western allies and thus weaken NATO.
   ``We cannot afford to be lulled into a false sense of security,''
the address reads. ``The jury is still out on how long or how far
the Soviet leadership will tolerate change.''
   He also presses the Western alliance to take advantage of its
technological superiority by developing more sophisticated weapons
systems than the economically strapped East bloc could afford to
match.
   The weekend session, ``Alliances in a Changing World,'' will give
Washington's allies their first good reading of the defense plans of
President Bush.
   It also is expected to spotlight differences among the allies
over how East-West disarmament should proceed.
   As Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has pushed for deep cuts in
nuclear stockpiles and announced some unilateral reductions in
troops, tanks and short-range missiles in Eastern Europe, West
Europeans have been increasingly critical of NATO doctrine.
   For example, West German public opinion polls show declining
fears of the East bloc and waning support for more defense spending
and the presence of allied troops, tanks and low-flying aircraft.

<HEAD>Heart Transplant Program Developer Dies Awaiting Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who helped develop New Mexico's
only heart transplant program died Friday after his own heart was
stricken suddenly by a viral infection and a donor organ could not
be found, officials said.
   Robert Shafer, 46, assistant administrator for medical staff
affairs at Presbyterian Hospital, suffered the attack last week, and
his condition rapidly deteriorated.
   ``The feeling of helplessness has gripped us all,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Lynn Villella. ``The donor program has done everything
humanly possible.''
   Shafer left work Jan. 19 with flu-like symptoms and was admitted
to the hospital Monday. He was put on a list of transplant
candidates Tuesday and placed on a heart-lung machine Wednesday
after his heart failed.
   On Friday morning, his family requested he be taken off the
machine after all his organs began to deteriorate, she said.
   Shafer, an administrator at the hospital for 20 years, oversaw
its heart program when it began in 1969 and helped direct its
development since then, Ms. Villella said.
   The program began transplants in 1986 and since then has done 32,
plus one heart-lung transplant.
   Gov. Garrey Carruthers had issued an appeal for a donor, as did
Shafer's wife, Joyce, who pledged to work to increase public
awareness of the need for donor organs. ``This should never happen
to anyone else,'' she said in a statement.
   Many viruses can either attack the heart directly or cause the
body's immune system to damage the heart, said Dr. Ronnie Garner, a
Presbyterian pathologist.
   Shafer's case was particularly unusual because of the quick
progression to complete heart failure, he said.

   A baby born during a blaze was killed
along with the parents Friday in the fire that gutted their mobile
home, the coroner said.
   The bodies of Mitchell and Terry Pierce, both 27, were found in a
bedroom, the newborn beside the mother, said Jackson County Coroner
David Miller.
   The couple's 21-month-old child, James Dilon Pierce, was rescued
by his grandfather, who lived next door, and was in critical
condition at the University of South Alabama Medical Center,
authorities said.
   Relatives said that Mrs. Pierce had been expecting her second
child any day and that her husband, a fisherman, had been working in
Alaska but had returned home to await the birth.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.

<HEAD>Bush Says Embassy Closed to Save U.S. Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, offering a dim assessment of
the situation in Afghanistan as Soviets troops withdraw, said Friday
that U.S. Embassy officials have been ordered out of the war-torn
country to save their lives.
   ``It is a prudent policy to protect a handful of American
lives,'' Bush told an impromptu White House news conference.
   Bush, queried about the reason behind Secretary of State James A.
Baker III's decision to close the Kabul embassy, said:
   ``I think there's a lot of uncertainty. There's enough
uncertainty that the secretary of state was taking prudent action in
this regard.''
   Fewer than 10 diplomats and security guards are left in the U.S.
outpost. All travel by American civilians to the country had already
been banned.
   The safety of the U.S. contingent came into question in recent
weeks as fighting has intensified between U.S.-supported rebels and
the Soviet-backed regime of Najibullah.
   The rebels are expected to launch an all-out drive against the
government forces once the last of 50,000 Soviet soldiers leave the
capital, which Moscow has said will come by Feb. 15.
   Bush said he did not mention Afghanistan last week when he spoke
at length with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but said he
was convinced the withdrawal will continue.
   Bush went on to say that he believed there is ``uncertainty about
what follows'' the pull-out and that he hoped the United States
would play a ``catalytic role for helping bring about stability'' in
the future.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman echoed Bush's comments,
saying the decision to remove the employees was made ``solely on
security grounds, in a deteriorating situation and growing
uncertainty that the regime can provide any kind of security in the
coming days.''
   Redman added that the move, which affects fewer than 10 diplomats
and security guards, does not mean that the diplomatic post has been
shut down for good. ``We hope to have our people back there as soon
as the security situation would permit that,'' he said.
   Fewer than 20 U.S. citizens are in Afghanistan. They have been
encouraged to leave by U.S. officials.
   A group of Afghan employees will remain at the embassy,
essentially as housekeepers, the spokesman said.
   Redman pointed out that closing the embassy does not create a
major diplomatic problem because the United States does not
recognize the legitimacy of the Najibullah regime and the embassy
had acted primarily as ``a listening post.''
   ``We don't have any interests to represent because we don't
recognize the legitimacy of that regime in any case,'' Redman said.
   Afghan guerrillas, armed by the United States and Pakistan, are
fighting to wrest control of the country from government forces
backed by the Soviets. The drive by the Mujahedeen rebels for Kabul
and a deteriorating situation in the capital threatened to expose
the Americans to the cross-fire.
   The U.S. diplomatic contingent was gradually reduced over the
years, and the country has been without a full-time American
ambassador since Adolph Dubs was killed by Afghan forces a decade
ago.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria Announce Troop Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria
announced Friday they will follow their Warsaw Pact allies and cut
troops and defense spending.
   Only Romania, increasingly isolated in the Soviet bloc, has not
made a similar announcement.
   Czechoslovakia said Friday it will cut defense spending by 15
percent and trim its armed forces by 12,000 men, 850 tanks, 165
armored vehicles and 51 fighter planes in the next two years.
   Hours later, the Bulgarian state news agency announced the State
Council and government approved a motion from Communist leader Todor
Zhivkov to reduce the country's 1989 defense budget by 12 percent
and its armed forces by 10,000 men.
   By 1991, Bulgaria also will scrap 200 tanks, 200 artillery
systems, 20 aircraft and five naval units, BTA said without
elaborating.
   According to NATO, Bulgaria has 135,000 men under arms and
Czechoslovakia 145,000.
   East Germany, Hungary and Poland all have announced cuts in
military manpower and spending, following the lead of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev who said Dec. 7 he would reduce the
Red Army by half a million men by 1991.
   The cuts seem designed to boost new NATO-Warsaw Pact talks on
reducing conventional troops and weapons across Europe, to open in
Vienna in March.
   They also benefit the Communist governments by freeing funds for
sorely needed economic reforms and by creating pressure for NATO to
follow suit with cuts of its own.
   A spokesman at the Western military alliance's Brussels
headquarters said Thursday the recently announced Soviet bloc
reductions still leave a ``great imbalance'' in Europe, with Western
ground troops outnumbered almost 2-1.
   CTK, the official Czechoslovak news agency, billed the measures
as a unilateral contribution to boost confidence and security in
Europe. Prague would contemplate more cuts if the West follows the
East's lead in cutting men and armaments, it said.
   The Czechoslovak army's reserve force would lose 15,000 men and
the number of divisions involved in military maneuvers and tactical
exercises would be halved, according to CTK.
   It said 20,000 soldiers now on active duty would be transferred
to army construction brigades, while the equipment for three more
divisions would be put into storage and most men from those
divisions diverted to other duties.
   The cuts in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary are in
addition to those announced by Gorbachev, who told the United
Nations on Dec. 7 that 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 Soviet tanks
would be withdrawn from those nations.
   Soviet defense officials have said partial withdrawal could begin
as soon as April.
   East Germany has said it would cut its armed forces by 10,000
soldiers and reduce defense spending by 10 percent. It also will
scrap 600 tanks and 50 warplanes.
   Hungary already has cut its military budget by 17 percent in real
terms from 1988, and in December announced plans to retire more than
50 top officers who are over 60 years old, including 10 generals.
   Poland said it has reduced its army by 15,000 men during the past
two years and would dissolve two divisions in 1989 and reduce two
more by 85 percent.
   It also said its military budget for 1989 is $1.9 billion,
representing 3.6 percent of this year's national income compared to
the 1988 budget's 3.8 percent of the year's national income.

<HEAD>Broadway Hit `Speed-the-Plow' Gets Mixed London Reviews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The London premiere of David Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow'' received mixed reviews for the play itself and
for the actress in the role created by Madonna.
   The acerbic comedy, which ended its hit Broadway run New Year's
Eve, opened in London on Wednesday at the National Theater, where
Mamet's ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' had its world premiere in 1983.
   That play won the London equivalent of the Tony Award as the
year's best, but on the basis of its critical reception,
``Speed-the-Plow'' seems unlikely to follow suit.
   Jack Tinker of The Daily Mail praised ``the strong and sinewy
dialogue'' of Mamet's short, three-act play, a morality tale set in
the wheeler-dealer environment of modern Hollywood.
   Tinker thanked the National for repairing ``the damage'' caused
by casting Madonna in New York, but he nonetheless felt the play has
``a hole where its heart should be.''
   Milton Shulman similarly faulted the play's ``basically hollow
center'' while admiring the ``breathless pace'' of the staging by
its original Broadway director, Gregory Mosher.
   ``Speed-the-Plow'' stars Colin Stinton and Alfred Molina as
fellow movie producers and longtime friends and Rebecca Pidgeon as
the temporary secretary, Karen, who momentarily throws their
friendship into question.
   Maureen Paton in The Daily Express wrote that Ms. Pidgeon ``puts
Madonna to shame (not difficult).'' The critic found the play
``biliously funny.''
   Michael Billington in The Guardian praised the actress'
``emotional directness'' and said Mosher's direction ``whips along
zippily.''
   But Michael Coveney in The Financial Times thought the play
``thinly textured'' and denounced Ms. Pidgeon as ``another woefully
inexperienced National Theater recruit.''
   ``Speed-the-Plow'' is expected to move to the commercial West End
in the summer, and the opening saw a full turn-out of London
producers.
   Mamet's play is the second American play to open in London this
week. On Monday, the Young Vic Theater opened ``Two-Way Mirror,''
two Arthur Miller one-acts which were poorly received in their
American debut in New Haven, Conn., in 1982.
   The London reception was marginally better, with critics
reserving most praise for David Thacker's production and the
performances of the stars, Helen Mirren and Bob Peck.
   Miller's writing itself drew mixed marks, with Charles Spencer in
The Daily Telegraph commenting: ``I was uneasily aware that if the
plays had been by a less venerable author and performed by less
persuasive actors, they would have commanded a great deal less
attention.''

<HEAD>Bush Backs Congressional Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday that members of
Congress are ``overdue'' for the 50 percent raise recommended by
Ronald Reagan and joined congressional leaders in proposing that the
raise be linked to strict limits on fees members may accept from
special interests.
   Bush told a news conference ``I do support'' the recommendations
of Reagan and a presidential commission for the raises for Congress,
federal judges and top executive branch officials.
   Bush said ``some elements'' of the proposed increase bothered
him, but pointed out that Congress' procedure on pay raises ``leaves
us with either the commission recommendation or nothing.''
   ``The ball is clearly in their court,'' Bush said of the
lawmakers. ``And so seeing the problems as I do, I still feel that I
should not go about undoing the Reagan decision.''
   Bush's views were similar to those of House leaders from both
parties, who plan to let the raise become law on Feb. 8 and then
enact broad restrictions on outside income. Congressional salaries
for rank-and-file lawmakers would rise from $89,500 to $135,000
under the commission proposal.
   House leadership negotiators have tentatively worked out the
broad elements of the plan, which would include a ban on honoraria,
such as speaking fees; close a loophole in federal law that has
allowed 190 House members to stash away more than $39 million in
surplus campaign money for their personal use; limit travel paid for
by special interests, and restrict non-honoraria income.
   The Senate is expected to vote overwhelmingly to reject the
raise, which will take effect unless both houses turn it down. Once
it becomes law, senators are expected to approve a package to
restrict outside income.
   Bush was asked how he viewed the raise given that polls show a
majority of Americans oppose the increase for lawmakers.
   ``A raise is overdue; there's no question about that,'' Bush
responded. ``There are some good things in this. The reform of the
honorarium, payments for these speeches, I think is very, very good.
I think it's good government.''
   The president said Reagan ``did consider all this carefully. He
went forward with the commission's recommendation.''
   Asked if he was concerned with the perception that he was
supporting the raise for a high-income group while forgetting
low-income Americans, Bush replied, ``No, I'm not concerned about
that perception. ...''
   He said the real issues for Americans are, ``How do we continue
to create jobs, keep it going?'' and ``How do we increase economic
opportunity?''
   ``And maybe there is a way to do it, but I don't think it would
be fair to say, when you take a pay raise that affects a tiny
fraction _ judges and congressmen _ that that has a broad economic
impact on the country.''

<HEAD>Senate Finance Committee Approves Hills for Trade Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee recommended Friday that
attorney Carla Hills be confirmed as U.S. trade representative after
she assured lawmakers she would fight to open global markets ``with
a crowbar if necessary.''
   ``We have to have our agreements enforced,'' said Mrs. Hills
before the Senate Finance Committee voted 18-0 to recommend
confirmation. ``And where our partners are violating our agreements
we must take action,'' she added.
   President Bush's nomination of the Washington attorney and former
housing and urban development secretary now goes to the full Senate
for a vote on confirmation. No date has been set.
   Mrs. Hills would succeed Clayton K. Yeutter, who has been tapped
by Bush for secretary of agriculture, in the job of top U.S. trade
negotiator.
   Before the committee, Mrs. Hills sought to dampen concern that
she could become vulnerable to conflict-of-interest charges because
she and her attorney husband, Roderick Hills, have represented
foreign law clients.
   ``Let me address the question of potential conflicts of interest
right away,'' she said. ``There are none.''
   She promised that she and her husband would divest themselves of
any business interests that could present such a conflict and that
she would keep hands off any cases involving her former clients.
Senators seemed satisfied.
   ``I think you're going to make a terrific trade representative,''
Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., said.
   A witness who appeared briefly before the panel, however, Anthony
Harrigan, president of the U.S. Business and Industrial Council,
argued that her involvement with foreign clients made it impossible
for Mrs. Hills to avoid a conflict. Several lawmakers took issue
with him.
   Mrs. Hills told the committee that she would prefer to open
foreign markets with negotiations and a handshake. But she added
that she would seek to do so ``with a crowbar if necessary.''
   ``Retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy,'' she said. ``In
fact, it signals the failure to open foreign markets. But the
credible threat of retaliation provides essential leverage in our
market-opening efforts. Thus, actual retaliation will be used,
albeit reluctantly, to preserve the credibility of this threat.''
   Bush's choice of Mrs. Hills initially brought a statement from
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, that he had hoped
for someone with experience in international markets for the post.
   Bentsen had a more enthusiastic response when she appeared Friday
before his committee.
   ``You have done well and you have answered with more specifics
than I have normally heard from a person being confirmed,'' Bentsen
said. ``They usually fudge their answers more.''
   She discussed complex trade issues ranging from plywood exports
to European government subsidies for the Airbus Industrie jetliner
manufacturer.
   Supporters of Mrs. Hills have been assuring lawmakers that she
has the toughness to represent America in difficult trade battles.
   ``Make no mistake,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., ``this is a
gentle lady, but this lady has the guts of a lion.''
   Her tough-minded style found encouragement among panel members,
with Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., saying he found ``a touch of
naivete'' in Bush's vow to work for ``a kinder and gentler'' America.
   ``The world is not necessarily kinder and more gentle when it
comes to international trade,'' Baucus said. ``There's a state of
near economic war.''

   The European Court of Human Rights
agreed Friday to give a speedy hearing to a West German fighting
extradition to the United States, where he faces the death penalty
for a double murder in Virginia.
   In its interim ruling, the court agreed to give priority to the
case of Jens Soering, according to court spokesman Jack Henning. He
said the hearing will probably take place in late April or early May.
   The 22-year-old West German is wanted in Virginia for the March
30, 1985, murder of the parents of his girlfriend at their home in
Bedford County.
   He is in jail in Britain, which agreed to extradite him to stand
trial in Virginia. However, he is appealing that decision to the
European Court of Human Rights.
   Soering argues he faces the death penalty in violation of the
European Human Rights Convention, which says ``no one shall be
subjected to ... inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.''
   He also argues a lack of legal aid for appeals in Virginia
violates his human rights and that he was denied a full hearing in
the British courts to fight extradition.
   Virginia officials have agreed at Britain's request to recommend
that Soering not be put to death.
   The European Court of Human Rights, a body of the Council of
Europe, hears alleged violations of the European Convention of Human
Rights. Its rulings are binding on the 21 member states of the
council, which has its headquarters in this city.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam has promised the Bush administration it
will continue to cooperate with U.S. attempts to obtain an
accounting of U.S. servicemen still missing from the Vietnam war,
the State Department said Friday.
   Vietnam's ambassador to the United Nations, Trinh Xuan Lang,
spent an hour Thursday discussing that issue with officials from the
State Department, National Security Council and the Pentagon.
   It was the first visit by a Hanoi official for diplomatic
discussions since the northern half of Vietnam became independent
from France in 1954. The southern half of Vietnam came under Hanoi's
rule after 1975.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the session with
Lang dealt exclusively with the POW-MIA issue.
   The administration allowed Lang's visit by waiving restrictions
which limit his travels to the New York City area.
   He had asked for permission to visit Washington to attend a
reception Thursday evening sponsored by Sight Savers International,
a non-profit group which trains foreign doctors in eye surgery
techniques.
   The administration used Lang's visit to reaffirm its concerns
about obtaining an accounting for the more than 1,700 U.S.
servicemen still missing in Vietnam.
   ``We explained the need for our investigations to be as thorough
as possible, for which the ambassador pledged his government's
continuing cooperation,'' Redman said.
   Redman and other officials have said Lang's visit should not be
construed as a softening of U.S. terms for normalizing relations
with Vietnam.
   The principal condition is the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops
from Cambodia.
   Lang was to meet Friday afternoon with Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alas., who has proposed the establishment of U.S. offices in
Vietnam to deal with humanitarian issues.

<HEAD>FTC Says Miami Company Agrees to Pay $105,000 Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miami company franchising the Fred Astaire
Dance Studios has agreed to pay a fine of $105,000 for violating a
1964 Federal Trade Commission order requiring certain refund and
cancellation rights for its students, the commission said Friday.
   The company, Ronby Corp., signed a consent decree agreeing not to
violate the order in the future, the FTC said.
   The decree settling the commission's complaint was filed with the
U.S. District Court in Miami. Under the decree, the company neither
admits nor denies guilt. But if the court adopts the decree, the
company may be punished for future violations.
   Over the objections of one of its members, the commission agreed
to accept the fine in installments.
   The commission said Ronby violated the 1964 order by requiring
customers to listen to sales pitches for future lessons before
completing their first course, by selling additional lessons during
instruction time, by failing to give refunds and attempting to
conceal the true price of lessons and by using relays of sales
representatives in attempts to sell lessons.
   The commission issued, for 30 days of public comment, draft
modifications of the 1964 decree. It said the changes would
strengthen protection for the students. Among other things, the
modifications call for pro rata refunds for unused lessons when a
customer cancels, and would require Ronby to cancel the franchise of
any studio violating terms of the modified order.
   The commission acted on a 3-1 vote, with Andrew J. Strenio
dissenting. He said he objected to installment payment of the fine,
and would have at least insisted on provision of collateral until
all the payments were made.

<HEAD>Engineer Says Firefighting System on Rig was Nearly Useless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A firefighting system was clogged and
``virtually useless'' on an oil rig where 167 men died in an
explosion and fire last year, a company engineer told an official
inquiry Friday.
   However, an Energy Department report last year said the system,
which sprays water to put out a fire, was turned off at the time
anyway because divers were repairing water intakes.
   Conrad Wottge, Occidental Oil Corp.'s facilities engineering
manager, said Friday he had warned of problems with what is called
the ``water-deluge system'' on the Piper Alpha rig in March 1988,
four months before the disaster.
   An interim inquiry concluded in September that an explosion in a
gas compressor of the North Sea rig ruptured gas pipelines, setting
off a series of explosions and fires. It was the world's worst oil
rig disaster.
   Wottge said the existing firefighting system was ``virtually
useless'' because it could not be counted on to put out a fire. He
said its pipes were clogged with mineral deposits and needed to be
replaced.
   He said design of a new system was underway at the time of the
disaster on July 6.
   He also said the rig had no structural fireproofing.
   The engineer recommended in March that most of the gas stored on
the rig be removed.

   Darkie toothpaste is being renamed and redesigned
to remove its logo of a grinning black minstrel after several groups
complained to Colgate-Palmolive Co. that the product was offensive,
the company said Friday.
   The toothpaste is manufactured and sold in Asia by the Hong
Kong-based Hawley &amp; Hazel Group. Colgate-Palmolive, which sells
household and hygiene products worldwide, became a joint partner
with Hawley &amp; Hazel in 1985.
   Since then, a group of congressmen and the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of church investors, have been
putting pressure on the companies to change what they said is
racially offensive packaging.
   The popular product, which has remained unchanged for 62 years,
will be renamed Darlie in all of its markets _ Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand _ within a year, Colgate-Palmolive
said.
   The company said the logo will be changed to a ``to a
non-racially offensive silhouette'' _ a racially ambiguous man in a
top hat.
   ``The management of Hawley &amp; Hazel and Colgate-Palmolive have
agreed that the old name and package presentation represents
offensive racial stereotyping that should be changed,''
Colgate-Palmolive said in a statement.
   ``We think it's acceptable,'' said Dara Demmings, a spokesman for
the Interfaith Coalition, which seeks to influence social and
financial issues within corporations through stock ownership.
   In addition to pressure from the coalition, three Interfaith
members who each owned at least $1,000 worth of Colgate stock
registered objections at a shareholders meeting in May.
   The shareholders included the Illinois-based School Sisters of
St. Francis; Southern Province of the Missionary Oblates of Mary
Immaculate in San Antonio, Texas, and a nun who owns shares for the
Sisters of Loretta, based in Kentucky.
   Similar pressure from outside groups led Quaker Oats Co. to
modify its Aunt Jemima figure in the 1960s to make her look less
like a plantation cook and forced the Sambo's restaurant chain to
rename itself No Place Like Sam's in the 1970s.
   Ms. Demmings said she believed Colgate-Palmolive officials were
hampered by objections from Hawley &amp; Hazel, who told a group of
congressmen as late as last month that it had no plans to change the
product's name.
   ``It's unfortunate that it took so long,'' said New York Rep.
Edolpus Towns, a member of the Congressional Government Operations
Committee who voiced objections to the product during a visit to
Taiwan in December.
   Towns also praised Colgate-Palmolive for making ``a diligent
effort since day one of their relationship (with Hawley) to correct
this insensitive name and logotype.''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, another committee member,
praised the company ``for its understanding, albeit late,'' and
urged other companies to ``act accordingly.''

   After a week in the White House, the signs are
unmistakable that George Bush has shifted into a lower gear Ronald
Reagan's pursuit of reconciliation with the Soviet Union.
   The new president is also flashing the yellow light of caution on
the Middle East as he gropes for foreign policy positions that bear
his imprint.
   While one week is hardly enough time to form judgments about a
president's performance, his comments at Friday's news conference
clearly left a deep impression of ``prudence,'' a word he used often
in the session.
   Ticking off some of the major areas of the policy he is slowly
formulating _ the Soviet Union, the Middle East and Central America
_ Bush told reporters, ``We've got to have a little time.''
   Where will he move first to leave his mark? Bush did not say.
   He told the news conference:
   ``I can't tell you ... where you will see the first major
initiative, whether it's going to be the Middle East, whether it's
going to be Central America.''
   Clearly, the Soviet Union has been the early foreign policy focus
of Bush; James A. Baker III, the new secretary of state, and Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser.
   ``We still have problems,'' Bush said in reference to Moscow.
``Are there still uncertainties? Are we still unsure of our
predictions on Soviet intentions? I'd have to say yes, we should be
cautious.''
   As he took the foreign policy reins from Reagan, Bush ordered a
broad, ``prudent reassessment'' of U.S. relations with the Soviet
Union.
   He said he didn't know how long the process would take. After
talking on the phone this week with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Bush said he does not think the Soviets consider his
reflective stance ``foot-dragging.''
   In fact, Bush sought to give the impression at Friday's news
conference that he would have a very active policy toward the Soviet
Union once the review is completed.
   ``I don't want to play defense,'' he said, ``and I don't want to
look like we're foot-dragging, just waiting around to let others set
the agenda.''
   But, he stressed, ``prudence is the order of the day.''
   Baker, who lacks experience both on the Soviet Union and the
Middle East, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his
confirmation hearings this week that he wanted to ``review the
bidding'' in U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear
weapons.
   Baker, who was treasury secretary before becoming Bush's
presidential campaign chairman, also said the United States should
avoid ``a headlong rush'' to provide Moscow with loans and credits,
traditionally useful tools in improving relations.
   Scowcroft, who has the experience, is registering concern that
Gorbachev's peace offensive has as one of its main goals ``making
trouble within the alliance'' of Western nations. He is suspicious
that Gorbachev's motivation is to buy time to reform the Soviet
economy _ which is a lot different from approaching Gorbachev
primarily as a world leader trying to ease East-West tensions.
   ``I think the Cold War is not over,'' Scowcroft said in a recent
assessment of the superpower relationship.
   On the Mideast, it seems clear that there, too, a go-slow
approach is developing.
   In their final days in power, Reagan and his secretary of state,
George Shultz, broke a 13-year embargo and opened U.S. talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shultz made five trips to the
Middle East in 1988, and while neither the Arabs nor Israelis agreed
to negotiations, Shultz left office optimistic about the future.
   ``There is more diplomatic fluidity now and opportunity there
than there's been in some time,'' he told reporters on his final
trip, to Vienna, last week.
   Baker, on the other hand, emphasized that ``we ought to all be
realistic about the prospects for achieving a breakthrough.'' He
also told the Senate committee ``there is no more intractable
problem facing us.''
   Baker was cool about the dialogue with the PLO, suggesting it
would be continued only if it proved useful.
   And he ruled out a Palestinian state, which the Reagan
administration had also opposed. That appears to eliminate an option
that has ardent Arab support and could make it more difficult to
entice Arab nations into any U.S. scenario for the Middle East.
   For his part, Bush said he would send Baker or another top U.S.
official to see PLO chairman Yasser Arafat only if was necessary to
finalize dramatic decisions.
   Bush told his news conference he hadn't ``given any thought at
all to what (and) when'' a meeting between Arafat and an American
official would be appropriate.
   He added:
   ``I would wait to see how we go forward. ... If there's some
logical step that requires high-level sign-off by various
participants over there, then, and then only, would it be proper to
elevate the meetings to that level.
   ``We're just starting. You crawl before you walk.''

   President Bush said Friday he left William
Bennett, the head of his anti-drug effort, out of the Cabinet to
free Bennett for anti-drug activities and not to lessen the
importance of Bennett's post.
   Bennett and some of his supporters were surprised that Bennett
was not made a member of the Cabinet.
   Bush could have permitted Bennett to meet with the Cabinet, as he
has done with Carla Hills, the administration's trade
representative, and Richard Darman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget.
   ``The reason he (Bennett) isn't in the Cabinet is that I tried to
reduce down the numbers of full Cabinet members,'' Bush told a news
conference. He was referring to the fact that he removed two
Cabinet-level posts from advisory group, including CIA director and
United Nations ambassador.
   ``And I think Bill Bennett's time is best spent not worrying
about agricultural subsidies _ when we have a meeting on agriculture
_ but concentrating on drugs.''
   Bush said he doesn't want his action misinterpreted as a
statement that he believes fighting drugs is of lesser importance
than other issues that might come before the Cabinet.
   ``You will see me, side by side with Bill Bennett, on putting the
proper emphasis from the Oval Office on my determination to do
everything in the government's power...to eliminate this scourge.''
   Bush said he wants to ``find a way to step up the total funding
on anti-narcotics,'' but he offered no specifics.
   The position of drug czar, formally known as director of National
Drug Control Policy, was set up last fall when Congress passed a
package of anti-drug legislation. The bill specified that the drug
czar should be a Cabinet-level job, but that is not the same as
actually being in the Cabinet.
   A Bush transition team official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Bennett was surprised when he was not invited to the
new administration's first Cabinet meeting Monday.
   Members of Congress also were surprised Bush left Bennett out of
the Cabinet. Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., said Bush should change the
decision.
   ``If the administration is going to keep the high profile it says
drugs is going to be, then I think there has to be room at the table
so that at every Cabinet meeting, there is a presence at the table
of this problem,'' Dornan said.
   Dornan said Congress had anticipated the drug czar would have
Cabinet rank in creating the job, even though the Cabinet's
membership is up to the president.
   Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said he was dismayed by the decision not to make the
position a Cabinet post.

   The Soviet Union has bought another 25,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part
of an authorization of more than 2 million tons under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment for March. Counting
some left over from a previous EEP arrangement and a newly
authorized 2 million tons this week, the Soviets have more than 2.01
million tons still available under the program.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 1.9
million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term
supply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec.
31, 1990.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 25,000 tons are equal to about 917,500 bushels worth
around $3.7 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.28 million tons of soybean meal, and 500,000 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Goldthwait said the 25,000 tons of wheat were sold by the Peavey
Co., which will get subsidy of $23.70 per ton, or about 65 cents per
bushel under the EEP arrangement.

<HEAD>U.N. Envoy Tries To Rekindle Persian Gulf Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A special U.N. envoy arrived Friday from
Iran for talks with Iraqi officials in an effort to get deadlocked
Persian Gulf peace talks moving again, U.N. officials said.
   Jan Eliasson arrived by helicopter from the southern port of
Basra after inspecting gulf cease-fire lines in the region, the
officials said. Iraqi television said he flew the full length of the
disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway.
   Asked whether he was bringing a new peace proposal, Eliasson
said: ``I just arrived and I really am not prepared to go into
questions of that nature.''
   Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador and Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar's special emissary, planned to meet with Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday, the officials said.
   There were no immediate signs that either gulf war rival was
prepared to soften its stand and enable the talks to resume.
   U.N.-sponsored peace talks between Iran and Iraq began in Geneva
on Aug. 25, five days after a cease-fire took effect in the
8-year-old gulf war.
   But the talks broke down immediately over the issue of troop
withdrawals to prewar borders. Two further round of negotiations
failed to make progress, and no date has been set for them to resume.
   Eliasson began his mission in Iran on Jan. 23, holding four days
of talks with Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati and other officials.
   He said before leaving Tehran: ``It is very important to create a
new momentum to speed up the trend of future peace talks.''
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Eliasson as saying
Friday that his talks ``were useful and fruitful.'' It had no
details.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Musavi as blaming
Iraq for the deadlock by refusing to withdraw from territory that
Iran claims was captured by the Iraqis in last-minute attacks before
the cease-fire took effect.
   Velayati said that before the peace talks begin again,
``arrangements should be made so that these talks ... result in the
full and speedy execution of the security council resolution,
including its first clause, that is the return of troops to the
international boundary.''
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, which both nations have
agreed to, calls on Iran and Iraq to halt all military activities
and honor the truce, withdraw troops to prewar borders, exchange
about 100,000 prisoners of war and start peace talks.
   Iran insists troop withdrawals must be the next stage in the
peace process. But Iraq says it will not pull out its troops from
the 259 square miles of occupied territory until Iran gives up the
right to search ships in the gulf for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   The Iranian news agency said Eliasson earlier inspected the
southern war front with Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad
Lavasani.
   It said the U.N. envoy was taken to an area where Iran said the
Iraqis captured several hundred Iranians after the Aug. 20
cease-fire, and also was shown three burning oil wells that Iran
claimed were set ablaze by Iraq.

<HEAD>Kemp Says Highest Priority Would Be to Ease Problem of Homelessness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabinet nominee Jack Kemp told Congress on
Friday that easing the ``appalling problem'' of homelessness would
be his highest priority as secretary of housing and urban
development.
   Kemp's Senate confirmation hearing was filled with bipartisan
praise for the secretary-designate but was interrupted by a brief
protest demonstration by housing activists.
   Kemp, a former congressman from New York and a 1988 Republican
presidential candidate, pledged to be an advocate for increased
federal efforts on housing for the poor.
   He avoided committing himself on most specific spending
questions, but said the Bush administration would revise former
President Reagan's proposal for the Housing and Urban Development
Department's spending in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   He promised to seek full funding of legislation passed by
Congress to provide emergency shelter for the homeless, called the
McKinney Act, and said he favored expanding it in some areas.
   ``I acknowledge that it is a very severe problem _ it is an
appalling problem,'' Kemp said of homelessness.
   ``It is an emergency problem, and I'm willing to treat it as the
highest priority, immediately, of my new leadership at HUD,'' Kemp
said.
   Kemp said he visited privately with leaders of Miami's riot-torn
Overtown and Liberty City areas last weekend when in that city for
the Super Bowl. He said, if confirmed, he planned to visit blighted
inner cities and to visit homeless people in New York City and
elsewhere.
   The Senate banking committee took no vote on Kemp's nomination,
but no opposition was voiced on the panel and he is expected to win
confirmation easily. A committee vote may come next week, after Kemp
answers additional written questions.
   His appearance was interrupted briefly by six demonstrators from
the Community for Creative Non-Violence, a Washington advocate for
the homeless. Two stood up holding a large sign saying ``Housing
Now,'' while they and others shouted and turned on a noisemaking
machine.
   ``There are people sleeping on the streets right now and you are
directly responsible for it,'' one woman shouted.
   The four women and two men were taken from the hearing room by
Capitol police and security personnel. They were arrested and
charged with disrupting a committee of the Congress and
demonstrating within a Capitol building, charges that carry a
maximum $500 fine and six-month jail term.
   ``I wish they'd stayed and heard my remarks,'' Kemp said of the
protesters.
   Kemp is a conservative Republican who has allied himself with
liberal Democrats on some urban issues, but also voted against major
housing legislation as a member of Congress. He said he said he
would ``transcend all ideological differences'' to look for ways to
help deal with urban problems.
   Asked by Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., the committee chairman, how
he could improve housing and other problems within the constraints
of the federal budget deficit, Kemp said, ``There's going to be some
give and take ... I am willing where necessary to fight for the full
funding, or to fight for increased funding, or to fight for
reordering priorities.''
   Kemp said he would pursue programs aimed at allowing
public-housing residents to buy their homes and would push for
enactment of tax incentives for urban enterprise zones, to encourage
job-creating businesses in distressed areas.
   ``We need to unleash the power of free enterprise in our inner
cities,'' he said.
   He repeated his support for expanded use of federal vouchers,
which provide rental subsidies directly to low-income families. But
he acknowledged the nation faces a problem with a shortage in
available affordable housing for low and moderate income people, and
said his goal would be to encourage tenant ownership without
depleting the affordable subsidized housing stock.
   Housing programs have been among the hardest-hit federal programs
by budget cuts of the Reagan administration years, with spending for
housing subsidies cut by more than 80 percent over eight years.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called rising homelessness ``the
most troublesome legacy of the Reagan administration.'' Riegle said
the lack of housing, and other urban problems, contribute to a lack
of hope and ``the beginnings of a kind of civil anarchy'' in cities.
   Reflecting the bipartisan support for Kemp, Cranston praised
Kemp's appointment and said ``you have the energy and abilities that
are sorely needed to bring new life to a department that has been
severely weakened in recent years.''

   Two men were arrested Friday on charges they made
the pipe bomb an animal rights activist is accused of planting
outside a surgical supply company.
   The men were also accused of making two other bombs found in the
woman's apartment.
   They were identified as the bomb makers by the woman, Fran
Stephanie Trutt, who is accused of planting the device in the
parking lot of U.S. Surgical Corp. in Norwalk, Conn., on Nov. 11,
authorities said. The bomb was not detonated.
   The remote-controlled, nail-packed explosive device was delivered
to Trutt in November for $450, authorities said.
   Police and FBI agents arrested Darrell Benvenuto, 20, and Marc
Anagnos, 21, at their homes in Queens, said Joseph Valiquette, an
FBI spokesman.
   Benvenuto, a student at Queens College, and Anagnos, a bank
teller, were charged with illegally making and selling explosive
devices. The charge carries up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   They apparently had no connection to U.S. Surgical or any animal
rights groups, authorities said.
   Trutt, 33, is being held on $500,000 bail on an attempted murder
charge. Authorities said she opposed the company's use of live,
anesthetized dogs to demonstrate surgical staplers, which close
incisions without stitches.
   The complaint said Anagnos told investigators that he and
Benvenuto made three bombs for Trutt in 1987, as well as a pipe gun,
a silencer and ammunition for Trutt, who said she wanted to use them
to kill a former friend.
   Trutt paid undisclosed amounts of money for the merchandise, the
federal complaint said.
   According to Anagnos' statement, he, Benvenuto and Trutt
detonated one of the bombs in a park. Anagnos said Trutt asked for
an additional bomb for a friend in Connecticut, the complaint said.
That was the one found at U.S. Surgical.
   At Trutt's apartment, investigators found sketches of bombs and
instructions on their manufacture, ``including how to achieve a
shrapnel-like effect by taping roofing nails to the bomb's outer
surface,'' the complaint said.
   New York Newsday reported Friday that Trutt said she wanted to
back out of the plan to bomb U.S. Surgical but was persuaded to
continue by a friend, Mary Lou Sapone, who allegedly was an
undercover agent for the company.
   U.S. Surgical president Leon Hirsch said this week that his
company had used paid informers to infiltrate animal rights groups
since the early 1980s.

   President Bush sought Friday to reassure
nervous savings and loan customers about the safety of their
deposits as the debate heats up over how to pump more money into the
government's S&amp;L insurance fund.
   ``The savings and loan deposits are backed by the full faith and
credit of the government and they are sound, they are good,'' Bush
told reporters at the White House. ``I want to assure the American
people of that and that's not going to change.''
   Bush's statement followed scattered reports that some S&amp;L
depositors had withdrawn their money after hearing news accounts
that the Bush administration is considering imposing a 25-cent fee
on every $100 in federally insured accounts in federally insured
thrifts, banks and credit unions.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said in a statement, ``In checking with regulators, ...
my staff was told that savings and loans are receiving a heavy run
of calls from depositors who are confused and concerned about the
reports of a new tax on their deposits. In some areas there have
been higher than expected withdrawals of funds.''
   At the news conference, Bush sidestepped questions about whether
he will propose the deposit insurance fee, an idea floated by the
Treasury Department.
   Bush stressed that a deposit fee is only one option being
examined, not a formal proposal, and has not yet reached his desk.
But he declined to rule it out.
   ``There seems to be some controversy around it, but that doesn't
mean that any thinking along those lines should cease,'' the
president said.
   Asked whether the fee would violate his ``no new taxes'' pledge,
Bush said, ``I've been around for a long time. I don't remember
hearing people talk about the fee that went into the FDIC or FSLIC
(deposit insurance funds) as a tax.''
   Meanwhile, the agency regulating S&amp;Ls, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, surveyed thrift institutions Thursday night and found,
according to spokesman Karl Hoyle, ``no outflows of any significance
that we can attribute to anything that's been said.''
   M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said in an interview Thursday
that although no institutions are in trouble as a result of nervous
depositors, ``There have been cases where they say, `I don't like
what I heard on TV; I'm taking my money out.'''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee and frequent critic of the bank board, said, ``There is no
doubt that Congress and the administration will insure every
depositor up to $100,000 no matter what else happens. I don't know
of a single congressman or senator or regulator who has even
entertained the notion of not backing the insured deposits 100
percent.''
   The bank board reported earlier this month that a record $7
billion in net withdrawals were made from savings and loan accounts
in November, the seventh consecutive month of deposit drains.
   However, it said this is a normal development during a period of
rising interest rates and not necessarily attributable to customers'
concerns over the safety of their money. When interest rates rise,
money flows out of S&amp;L and bank accounts because yields on uninsured
investments, such as money market mutual funds, typically rise
faster.
   The Treasury Department is due to present a proposal to Bush on
S&amp;Ls next week and department officials have been briefing members
of Congress on some of the options under consideration in addition
to a deposit fee.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a senior member of the banking
committee, said Treasury is talking about borrowing about $45
billion, roughly the amount needed over and above the $38 billion
committed last year, and is examining the full range of options for
how to pay it off.
   The laundry list includes using interest on Federal Reserve funds
that is now paid into the general fund, or tapping the retained
earnings of the industry-owned regional Federal Home Loan Banks.
   Options in the reform package that will accompany any new money
include an administrative merger of the fund that insures commercial
banks with the S&amp;L fund, as well as additional control by federal
regulators over risky activities undertaken by state-chartered S&amp;Ls,
Parris said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of established writers, painters
and other Czechoslovaks in the arts publicly sided with human rights
dissidents and urged the release of banned playwright Vaclav Havel,
emigre sources said.
   They also urged authorities to open a dialogue immediately with
burgeoning independent groups and with young people.
   It was believed to be the first time so many establishment
figures in Czechoslovakia took sides publicly with dissidents of the
Charter 77 human rights movement. That 1,000-member group Monday
urged Communist authorities to open a dialogue with independent
groups on political and social reform.
   The appeal by 692 writers, painters, filmmakers, actors, and
others came in a letter dated Thursday to Czechoslovak Premier
Ladislav Adamec, two emigre sources said on condition of anonymity.
The signatories include Oscar-winning film director Jiri Menzel,
actress Jana Brejchva and painter Jan Bauch, the sources said.
   The letter also said the signatories were ``disturbed and
offended'' by how the official media reported on demonstrations last
week in Prague, the sources said.
   The emigre sources said the letter called for release of Havel,
the country's best-known dissident, and other activists detained
with him on Jan. 16.
   Fifteen activists were arrested, but only Havel, 58, and two
others remain in custody. All have been told they will face charges
of hooliganism or disturbing public order. Government spokesman
Miroslav Pavel said this week Havel probably will be charged with
hooliganism, which carries a penalty of up to two years in jail.
   Last week's wave of demonstrations was the biggest since the
weeks after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968
crushed government reforms.
   Governments, trade unions and artists in the West expressed
outrage in 1979 when Havel and five other dissidents were jailed
after a two-day subversion trial.
   Articles in the official media have branded as anti-socialist
Charter and other independent groups who called a banned rally on
Jan. 15. The use of police force to crush that rally fueled last
week's protests, and all but one of the new protests were broken up
by police.
   At last week's demonstrations, thousands of people chanted for
the release of Havel.

<HEAD>Farm Losses Don't Add to Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $36 billion backlog of losses piled up by the
Farmers Home Administration is not adding to the federal budget
deficit, according to a report Friday by the Congressional Research
Service.
   ``Although FmHA loan losses are large, the budget impact of these
losses have already been recognized in scaled-down projections for
future loan repayments,'' the report said. ``The writeoff of these
delinquent loans per se does not require a budget outlay; hence, the
deficit is not affected.''
   The report said a recent audit by the General Accounting Office,
another agency of Congress, showed that FmHA over a 40-year period
through 1987 had as much as $36 billion in accumulated deficits that
will require large sums of congressional funding.
   ``This led some observers to conclude that FmHA will likely fuel
the federal budget deficit by requiring an infusion of cash similar
to the plight of the savings and loan crisis,'' the report said.
   The FmHA funds its accumulated losses by borrowing directly from
the Treasury. Each year, the report said, the agency asks Congress
for reimbursement of losses that were incurred two years earlier.
For example, the budget requests for the 1990 fiscal year that will
begin Oct. 1 will be for fiscal 1988 losses.
   ``To date, FmHA has been reimbursed by annual congressional
appropriations for virtually all of the $39 billion in loan
writeoffs that it has recognized through (fiscal) 1989,'' the report
said. ``FmHA estimates that nearly $20 billion in loan loss
reimbursement requests will be submitted over the next several
years.''
   The report said that while it may be inaccurate to compare FmHA
losses to the savings and loan situation, ``the magnitude of FmHA's
loan repayment problems should not be diminished.''
   But it added: ``Most budget projections already take into account
that the most seriously delinquent FmHA loans will not be repaid.
Therefore, unless there were another downturn in the farm economy or
other economic shock that caused a further deterioration in the
repayment capacity of FmHA borrowers, future outlays and the federal
deficit should not be further affected by loan repayment problems.''
   The report, which was dated Jan. 18, was written by agricultural
policy analyst Ralph Chite of the Congressional Research Service's
food and agriculture section.
   As an agency of the Agriculture Department, the FmHA is often
called the government's lender of last resort for farmers who cannot
qualify for credit elsewhere. As of last Sept. 30, the agency had
total loans outstanding of about $62 billion.
   Less than half of the total, about $25.5 billion, was owned under
farm lending programs. The balance was for FmHA loans for rural
housing and rural development.
   Of the total $62 billion in loans, about $9.2 billion were
delinquent as of last Sept. 30. The farm delinquencies represented
$8.3 billion of that amount. The FmHA has sent collection notices to
thousands of delinquent borrowers telling them to make arrangements
with the agency for repayments or face the possibility of forced
sales or foreclosures.

<TEXT>
   The man who gave the University of Notre
Dame a sweater worn by football legend George Gipp says he is
stunned the university gave it away _ even to Ronald Reagan.
   ``Belatedly, I now regret not stipulating that the Gipp monogram
would be `on loan,''' said John N. Cackley in an opinion column in
Friday's South Bend Tribune.
   ``I never dreamed that someone at Notre Dame would go to the
extreme of satisfying egos in the White House and at the university
just to create an atmosphere of good old-fashioned `show biz,'''
said Cackley, a 1937 graduate and executive director emeritus of the
alumni association.
   University President Edward Malloy presented the blue and gold
Notre Dame sweater to Reagan when the national champion Notre Dame
football team visited the White House on Jan. 18, two days before
Reagan left office.
   Reagan played the dying Gipp in the 1940 movie ``Knute Rockne,
All-American,'' his first big break in the movies. He has used as a
political slogan Rockne's instruction to his players to ``win one
for the Gipper.''
   Cackley, of South Bend, said the 70-year-old sweater was an
``authentic, irreplaceable, one-of-a-kind'' item that had been
displayed only six months near the athletic department offices.
   ``Tradition, so often cherished at this institution, was shunted
aside with the Gipp article being handed over to the old actor for
his Notre Dame collection,'' he said.
   Charles Lennon, director of the Notre Dame Alumni Association,
said at least 15 alumni called to praise the idea.
   ``Most of our alumni would certainly understand the gift has
strong meanings for the president, as well as to the university,''
he said.
   Cackley said the dying Gipp gave the sweater to roommate Percy
Wilcox, who later passed it to another classmate, Tom Lee. Lee gave
the sweater to Cackley, who kept the sweater about five years before
giving it to Notre Dame.
   ``The sweater was not intended to be a give-away, regardless of
who might like to have it _ whether that be Ronald Reagan, Jimmy
Carter, John Paul II or anyone else,'' he said.
   University spokesman Richard Conklin referred questions to James
E. Murphy, associate vice president for university relations, who
was out of town Friday.

   President Bush said Friday he would keep U.S.
talks going with the Palestine Liberation Organization but was
skeptical about direct overtures to chairman Yasser Arafat.
   In contrast to the warm reception the barnstorming Palestinian
leader is receiving on a support-seeking tour of Western Europe, the
president was reserved.
   ``I haven't given any thought at all to a meeting of the
chairman, Mr. Arafat, with an American official,'' Bush said at a
news conference.
   U.S. talks with the PLO were opened last month by then-President
Reagan. The U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, was
designated as the only official channel to the organization, some of
whose factions the State Department has charged with terrorism.
   Bush said he would ``wait to see how we go forward'' before
considering a high-level meeting.
   He acknowledged U.S. policy in the Middle East had changed with
the overture to the PLO. He said as long as the organization stayed
committed to Arafat's renunication of terrorism and acceptance of
Israel's right to exist ``we will have, when appropriate, meetings
with the PLO.''
   But asked if he would direct Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to meet with Arafat or another high-level official, Bush took a
cautious stance.
   ``I would wait to see how we go forward,'' Bush said. ``The point
of talking to them is to try to facilitate peace in the Middle East.
... If there are some logical steps that require high-level signoffs
by various participants over there then, and then only, would it be
proper to elevate the meetings to that level.''
   Bush added: ``We are just starting. ... You crawl before you
walk.''
   The president did not say what specific steps he required the PLO
to take before he would consider such a high-level meeting.

   The head of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
said Friday he hopes the panel will receive more attention from
President Bush than it did during the Reagan administration.
   Chairman William B. Allen said he hadn't heard directly from Bush
about any plans to elevate the stature of the commission or to boost
spending.
   However, Allen said, ``I would certainly urge it upon the
president to give greater attention to the Commission on Civil
Rights.''
   Asked how he would describe Bush's position on civil rights
issues, Allen said, ``I would not purport to speak on behalf of the
president. I think that he's capable of doing that himself.''
   ``I will say to you, however, that it seems to me Mr. Bush has
made it clear that he wishes to chart his own course, he wishes to
form his own reputation. And I believe we owe him the opportunity to
do just that,'' he said.
   Allen spoke at a forum sponsored by the Cato Institute, a
conservative think tank.
   In statements and meetings with black leaders, Bush has tried to
separate himself from the poor relationship that minority groups had
with the Reagan administration, in which he served as vice president
for eight years.
   During his news conference Friday, the president was asked about
the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision earlier this week
that drew criticism from many civil rights leaders.
   Bush told reporters the decision ``didn't kill all set-asides and
it didn't kill off affirmative action. I have been committed to
affirmative action.''
   He also said he wants to see reinvigorated programs by the Office
of Minority Business and the Small Business Administration.
   Allen, in an interview, sought to distance himself from the
criticism of the affirmative action ruling voiced by other civil
rights leaders.
   ``This ruling has a good deal more than has met the eyes of the
first people who looked at it,'' he said. ``It is not, in the first
place, an overturning of affirmative action. Quite the opposite, it
is a fairly emphatic reaffirmation of affirmative action as a remedy
available to Congress. ...
   ``In the second place, it is a statement that states and
municipalities may indeed also use racial preferences. But they are
required to do so only subject to strict scrutiny. They must be able
to prove either that they themselves were involved in
discrimination, or that others subject to their jurisdiction were
practicing discrimination,'' Allen said.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers and politicians Friday said a
proposed ditch along the Mexico-U.S. border near San Diego is
designed to deter immigrants and is an unacceptable, offensive and
hostile action by the United States.
   The Foreign Ministry said it was told the 5-foot-deep,
14-foot-wide ditch was to solve drainage problems on Otay Mesa,
along the border, not to control migration.
   U.S. Associate Attorney General Francis A. Keating II said the
main purpose of the ditch is to discourage drug smugglers from
driving across the border. The area also is one of the most popular
crossing points for illegal immigrants entering the United States.
   The project's engineering and drainage aspects are not what
bothers Mexico, the government newspaper El Nacional said Friday.
   ``What causes uneasiness in Mexico is what it symbolizes: the
aftertaste of a certain spirit of lack of understanding and
intolerance, as a material obstacle to make the entrance more
difficult ... for men and women who in the end are only searching
for work in a foreign land and frequently suffer bad treatment and
even aggression as a result of the atmosphere of hostility,'' it
said.
   The newspaper Excelsior said: ``The idea of digging a ditch in a
certain part of the border between Mexico and the United States can
only be described as unacceptable and worrisome since it signals a
new wave of unilateral measures to deal with the problem of
undocumented Mexicans going to the United States.''
   El Universal, another major independent newspaper, noted that
President Bush just a few days ago talked of the importance of
improving relations with U.S. neighbors.
   ``These affirmations contrast with negative and unfriendly
attitudes, such as that hostile project, which certainly has nothing
to contribute to resolving problems and in contrast will increase
the differences,'' El Universal said.
   In Tijuana, Roberto L. Martinez, president of the local Pro-Law
and Justice Coalition said the ditch was a waste of money.
   ``What is needed is to pay attention to the social problems that
provoke the migratory movement and create well-paid jobs that allow
those people to stay in their places of origin,'' he said.
   ``No physical obstacle will be able to stop the migratory flow to
the United States,'' said Ofelia Woo of the Colegio de la Frontera
Norte, a Tijuana think tank. ``The social problem that migration
represents needs a bilateral solution from Mexico and the United
States.''
   Guadalupe Gomez Maganda, president of the foreign relations
commission of the Chamber of Deputies and a member of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, also attacked the plan.
   ``The U.S. government project constitutes an unfriendly and to a
certain degree hostile attitude that restricts the possibilities for
resolving together the problems of neighboring communities,'' the
congresswoman said.
   ``From the point of view of international relations, you can
consider it offensive,'' said Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, leader of
the leftist National Democratic Front.

<TEXT>
   The government is holding talks
with Nelson Mandela that could lead to his release from life
imprisonment, a Cabinet minister said Friday.
   In a statement carried by the independent South African Press
Association, Minister of Information Stoffel van der Merwe said,
``The situation that could lead to Mr. Mandela's release is being
discussed with him and it is being discussed in government circles.''
   But he said Mandela would not be freed ``if this would lead to
bloodshed'' and denied the government was actually discussing
conditions for the release.
   The minister was referring to government worries that Mandela's
release might spark a new outbreak of racial violence.
   Mandela, South Africa's best-known activist and leader of the
African National Congress, has been jailed for 26 years for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government. The congress, which is
banned, is the leading group fighting white minority rule.
   Mandela, 70, is being kept alone in a house on a prison farm near
Cape Town.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee has previously said he talked to
Mandela. It is not known if other senior government officials have
done so.

   Egypt and Israel failed to reach an agreement on
a disputed beach resort in a second round of talks ending Friday,
representatives of both sides said.
   Egyptian officials announced this week they planned to declare
sovereignty over the Red Sea resort on Sunday.
   But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said Friday that
Egypt apparently would tone down its original declaration and simply
announce Sunday that Egypt's Tourism Ministry is authorized to
handle talks on purchase of Taba's Israeli-owned luxury hotel.
   Israel says it wants more talks on ownership of the hotel and an
Israeli-owned resort village on the 250-acre strip. It says it also
wants more talks on ensuring access for Israeli tourists.
   Liel said the two sides discussed the issues but scheduled no new
talks.
   Nabil Arabi, head of the Egyptian delegation, said after the end
of talks Friday: ``We did not reach any agreement, and we're going
to report that back to our government.''
   Egyptian negotiators have argued that Egypt won sovereignty when
a panel of international arbitrators determined the location of a
series of border markers Sept. 29.
   But the Israelis argue that the arbitrators did not say how the
border should run from the last marker to the sea about 200 yards
away. If the border is extended in a straight line, Taba falls in
Egyptian territory. If it cuts back at a sharp angle, the resort
would be on Israeli land.
   Taba has been disputed since Israel refused to hand it back to
Egypt in 1982. Israel withdrew from the rest of the Sinai Peninsula
at that time under terms of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
   Israel captured the Sinai in the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEAD>Bush Says Iran Could Help Free Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush asserted Friday that Iran could
influence the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon and such a step
could help revive U.S.-Iranian ties.
   ``I don't want to ... think that the status quo has to go on
forever,'' Bush said of the defunct relationship between the two
countries.
   Speaking at a White House news conference, Bush said, ``... There
was a period of time when we had excellent relations with Iran.''
   At one pont, Bush said he wanted to make ``a broad appeal,
transcending Iran, to anybody that can be helpful to get the
hostages out.''
   Bush was queried about comments from Iran's president Ali
Khamenei, who criticized him for saying in his inaugural address
that Bush would appreciate help in gaining the release of the nine
Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   ``It was America which expressed interest in resuming ties with
Iran; Iran does not need America,'' Tehran radio quoted Khamenei as
saying.
   Bush said he was unaware of the remarks.
   But stopping short of listing specific conditions for a renewal
of the diplomatic relations that were severed in early 1980, Bush
said Iran could make progress with the United States through ``the
renunciation of terror in any form, and facilitating to the degree
they can the release of the hostages.''
   Bush, when queried, said Iran was not holding the hostages,
adding that ``different groups'' were involved in their fate.
   But to the question of whether Iran exercised control over them,
Bush said the United States has ``varying degrees of intelligence on
that, various assessments as to how much control they have over
Hezbollah or these families or whoever it is.''
   Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalist group that
operates in Lebanon, where the hostages are believed to be held.
   ``I would just reiterate my view that the way to improve
relations is to let them go, give these people their freedom _ they
didn't do anything wrong,'' Bush said.
   Asked if Iran could affect the hostages' release, he responded,
``I think they can have influence.''
   Ties between the United States and Iran were severed soon after
the 1979 Islamic revolution, when militant Iranian students took
over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for
444 days.
   Fifteen foreigners, including the nine Americans, are believed
held hostage in west Beirut by pro-Iranian factions.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Federal prosecutors dropped conspiracy and fraud
charges against Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. on Friday, moments before a
Virginia judge sentenced the political extremist to 15 years in
prison for related offenses.
   All charges against LaRouche and six associates were dropped. The
Justice Department refused to drop charges against three
co-defendants who are fugitives.
   The Boston case _ in which LaRouche was accused of conspiring to
obstruct an investigation of an alleged $2 million credit card and
loan fraud _ ended in a mistrial in May after five months of
testimony. A new trial was to begin Feb. 22.
   LaRouche was sentenced in Alexandria, Va., to 15 years in prison
for scheming to defraud federal tax collectors and deliberately
failing to repay more than $30 million in loans from political
supporters.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said the Justice Department
felt dismissal was warranted because ``the major participants in the
Boston crimes have now received substantial sentences either in
Boston or in Alexandria.''
   ``It was the Boston prosecuting effort which led to the evidence
which allowed the indictment and convictions in Alexandria, and I
think justice was served by the substantial sentences received,''
said Markham, who handled both cases.
   ``Additional effort would be a waste of the court's time and
resources. We've got nothing more to gain.''
   LaRouche, who has run for president four times, is known for is
extreme views, including support for a quarantine of AIDS victims
and allegations that Queen Elizabeth is involved in drug trafficking.
   LaRouche, six aides and five political organizations were charged
with conspiring to obstruct a grand jury investigation into
allegations that his 1984 presidential campaign raised more than $2
million by credit card and loan fraud.
   LaRouche was accused of ordering supporters to destroy records
and refuse to cooperate with investigators. All the aides and
organizations also are charged with conspiracy, and four of the
groups are charged with fraud.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton declared a mistrial after
four jurors complained about the length and conduct of the case,
which was repeatedly delayed by defense motions.

<TEXT>
   The few remaining staff members locked
the U.S. Embassy's gray steel doors Friday and plan to evacuate
before the Red Army leaves the ragtag Afghan army to a showdown with
Moslem guerrillas.
   One Western diplomat said the decision to close the embassy was a
surprise and indicated lack of confidence in both the
Soviet-sponsored government and the insurgents, to whom the United
States provides arms.
   A Soviet official called it ``psychological warfare'' intended to
undermine the government and get other nations to do the same.
   Britain and Japan announced Friday they also would shut their
Kabul missions. France said its embassy would be closed
``provisionally.'' In Rome, Foreign Ministry sources confirmed the
Italian Embassy will close soon.
   State-owned Kabul Radio broadcast a Foreign Ministry statement
deploring the decisions and insisting the government can defend
expatriates:
   ``The government of Afghanistan is capable of defending peace in
the entire country, including Kabul,'' it said. ``The life of not a
single foreign national was lost in the last nine years of
fighting.''
   In Washington, President Bush said there was ``uncertainty about
what follows'' the Soviet departure and the embassy was being closed
to protect American lives.
   When asked when the embassy would be formally closed, Jon D.
Glassman, U.S. charge d'affaires, said: ``That's not information we
are giving out.''
   The State Department said Thursday the remaining Americans would
leave in a few days. Dependents and all but 11 diplomats and
security guards already have been evacuated.
   A battle for Kabul, which is surrounded by insurgents, is
expected after the last Soviet forces withdraw Feb. 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement. The embassy is in the heart of the capital
next to the state radio and across from secret police headquarters,
both prime targets for the guerrillas.
   A dispatch from Kabul by official Soviet news agency Tass said
five rockets fired by ``extremists from among the intransigent
opposition'' hit residential areas of Kabul on Friday, killing a
child and damaging several buildings.
   Moslem guerrillas have rejected Soviet and government proposals
for a political settlement. They began fighting after a communist
coup 11 years ago and Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in
December 1979.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet troopers were here when the
withdrawal began May 15 and the last 50,000 are to be gone by Feb.
15.
   They leave behind a conscript Afghan army plagued by desertion.
Diplomats say the army has been driven to dragging teen-agers from
their homes and pressing them into service; the military calls them
volunteers.
   U.N. officials said Friday in New York that Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar would not accept an invitation to visit
Afghanistan before the Soviets are gone. President Najib had asked
him to Kabul to explore ways of preventing more bloodshed after the
departure.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov flew to Kabul on Friday and
met Najib. Kabul Radio said they discussed bilateral cooperation.
   The Pakistani government said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze will visit Pakistan on Feb. 4 for last-ditch talks to
prevent further bloodshed in Afghanistan.
   In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh met
with Ambassador Abdul Sattar of Pakistan, the other principal
guerrilla supporter. Refugee camps just inside Pakistan,
Afghanistan's eastern neighbor, serve as rebel bases and supply
points.
   A statement from the Geneva office of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan,
U.N. coordinator of relief and rehabilitation, said he was
considering an emergency appeal for help because of severe food
shortages in Afghanistan.
   Insurgents control the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, through
which the Salang Highway runs 250 miles north to the Soviet border.
They have increased attacks along the route for southbound food and
fuel convoys, and few reach Kabul.
   Reports indicate most Soviet units are leaving Kabul well ahead
of the deadline to protect the Salang, the Red Army's land route
home and the capital's lifeline.
   Diplomats in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Thursday they had reports
that Soviet artillery demolished villages south of the Salang tunnel
and shelled both ends of the tunnel, which cuts through the Hindu
Kush mountains 60 miles north of Kabul.
   In Friday's dispatch, Tass said Afghan soldiers killed ``tens''
of insurgents in an operation against Ahmed Shah Masoud, the
guerrilla commander who controls the Panjshir.
   Outside the U.S. Embassy's 7-foot-high walls, topped with coils
of barbed wire, a 25-year-old Marine guard took telephone numbers of
visitors and said embassy personnel would call them later.
   ``We're not going to let anything happen to you,'' said the
guard, David Hinkell of Hightown, Va.
   On Tuesday, the embassy advised all Americans in Afghanistan to
leave.

   Students upset over a contract dispute that is
holding up their grades gave administrators an economics lesson
Friday by boycotting homeroom classes a second straight day, costing
the district $15 per student.
   Teachers in the nation's second-largest school district have been
without a contract since July. Some have refused to work beyond
class hours in protest and have withheld grades, causing problems
for seniors applying to college.
   ``The teachers have what we want. The school board has what the
teachers want (money). And we have what the school board needs
(attendance at homeroom),'' said protester Alicia Barton, a senior
at Washington High School.
   State aid is based on homeroom attendance, with $15 withheld per
day for each student absent. Shel Erlich, a district spokesman, said
he didn't know how much money was lost during the two days of
protest.
   Erlich said he didn't know how many of the district's 600,000
students were involved in the demonstrations Friday, but more than
1,000 students protested Thursday.
   On Friday, there were protests at 16 of the Los Angeles Unified
School District's 700 schools, said Erlich.
   Protesters were mostly high school students, but some were in
junior high and elementary school. Limited protests were expected
next week, students said. Kemo Lee, student body president at Dorsey
High School, said the students support the teachers, ``but we feel
we are being used as a bargaining tool.''
   Chants during some of the student protests were directed at
administrators: ``No grades. No homeroom. No money.''
   There was no indication that the student protest spurred progress
in negotiations between teachers and the district, which are under
the supervision of a mediator.
   The teachers are seeking a one-year agreement with a 12 percent
raise; the district is offering 17 percent over three years.
Starting salary is $23,000.
   Teachers stopped sending grades to the district earlier this
month. They said students could obtain unofficial, union-prepared
report cards. But students said not all colleges will accept such
documents.
   LeRoy Gorman, a student at Dorsey, applied to the University of
Denver. He said he was told by university officials they needed
official midyear transcripts by March.
   ``They said what's going on in California is `not our problem.
... We need the transcripts,''' he said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Clears Way for Partial Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court cleared the way Friday
for the partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers under an
exemption to anti-trust laws granted by then-Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   A split panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld
Meese's decision to allow the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit
News to form a joint operating agreement under the Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman, writing for the 2-1 majority,
rejected arguments that Meese had arbitrarily overruled an
administrative law judge's findings that the two newspapers did not
qualify for the anti-trust exemption.
   Silberman said Meese's decision was ``based on a permissible
construction'' of the 1970 law empowering the attorney general to
let two newspapers form joint operating agreements after determining
that one of the dailies was in ``probable danger of financial
failure.''
   ``Congress ... delegated to the attorney general, not to us, the
delicate and troubling responsibility of putting content into the
ambiguous phrase, `probable danger of financial failure,''' the
appeals court ruling said.
   ``We cannot say that his interpretation of that phrase ... was
unreasonable,'' Silberman wrote in an opinion joined by Circuit
Judge Spottswood W. Robinso the same period, were unprofitably solely
because the two dailies had cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to
force each other out of business.
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to close the Free Press if the joint
operating agreement is not approved.
   ``This is clearly good news for the future of the Free Press,
good news for our readers and the people of Michigan,'' Free Press
publisher and chairman David Lawrence said in a statement. ``My hope
is that this decision will allow us to go forward soon,'' Lawrence
said.
   There was no immediate comment from Gannett Co. Inc., which owns
the News.
   In a separate order issued after the opinion, the circuit court
vacated a stay that prevented the merger from taking place while the
issue was under review. The ruling upheld a decision in September by
U.S. District Judge George Revercomb, who refused to enjoin the
merger.
   Meese approved the merger even though an administrative law judge
and the head of the Justice Department's anti-trust division
separately concluded that the Free Press did not qualify for the JOA
status.
   The administrative law judge held that once a JOA were denied,
the News would raise its prices, allowing the Free Press to follow
suit and return to financial solvency.
   Opponents seized on this conflict within the Justice Department,
but Silberman rejected their argument, saying Meese ``did not want
to play the high-stakes regulatory game that the law judge had
proposed.
   ``He obviously was concerned that if he gambled on'' the law
judge's prediction that both newspapers were bluffing, ``Detroit
would lose a newspaper,'' wrote Silberman.
   ``Both men relied upon the very same facts to make different
evaluations of the competitive strength of the Free Press,''
Silberman acknowledged. ``But, it is only the attorney general's
conclusions that have legal significance, and we cannot say that his
determination is unreasonable.''

<HEAD>Education Secretary Mum On Whether Bush Will Seeks More Funding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos told Congress
on Friday that President Bush is reworking next year's proposed
budget to incorporate education programs he espoused during the
campaign but was mum on whether Bush would seek more money.
   Cavazos, testifying at a Senate Labor Committee hearing, said a
high Bush education priority would be targeting federal education
money to disadvantaged kids and he said Bush is eager to prove his
campaign promise to be known as the ``education president.''
   But, under questioning from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who
called the hearing to discuss the role of the nation's schools in
training future workers, Cavazos was not specific about whether Bush
would recommend spending more on education in the next fiscal year
than the nearly $22 billion proposed by former President Reagan in
his farewell budget.
   Cavazos said he is working ``with the White House to shape that
budget. ... Many of the things that the president talked about
during the campaign hopefully will be reflected in that budget.''
Bush is expected to submit budget amendments to Congress next month.
   Among the Bush education priorities is encouraging school
districts to allow parents to choose the school their children
attend, a move Cavazos said would result in competition that would
expose poor schools.
   ``If it is not of high quality, it should not remain open,'' the
secretary said in his first appearance before the 101st Congress. In
an unusual move applauded by Kennedy, Cavazos, the first witness,
stayed to listen to other witnesses.
   Kennedy opened the hearing by saying that when adjusted to
account for inflation, federal education spending was below its 1980
level. He borrowed Bush campaign rhetoric in suggesting Bush could
prove his commitment by proposing an increase in education spending.
   ``With a new administration, perhaps we can fund education as if
our future depends on it _ because it does,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass.,
chairman of the committee. ``The road to a kinder, gentler nation
begins at the schoolhouse.''

<HEAD>Bush Now Wants to Avoid Terms Like `Cold War'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an apparent change of heart, President Bush
said Friday he would not use the term ``Cold War'' to describe
relations between Washington and Moscow. He used exactly those words
seven months ago.
   ``I want to try to avoid words like `Cold War' if I can because
that has an implication,'' Bush said at a White House news
conference. ``If someone says `Cold War' to me, that doesn't
properly give credit to the advances that have taken place in this
relationship.
   ``So I wouldn't use that term. But if it's used in the context of
_ do we still have problems, are there still uncertainties, are we
still unsure of _ in our predictions on Soviet intentions, I'd have
to say yes, we should be cautious.''
   In a speech June 29 in San Francisco before the World Affairs
Council, a foreign policy group, Bush said:
   ``We've got to remember the Cold War is not over. We must be bold
enough to seize the opportunity of change but at the same time, as
one pundit titled his column, be prepared for `the protracted
conflict.'''

<TEXT>
   Barely a week into his new job, President Bush
proved himself deft at his first full-blown White House news
conference, making his points while keeping things light with an
easy-going style.
   Laughter was frequent as Bush, occasionally bantering with
reporters, showed the relaxed and upbeat demeanor he has maintained
since his election.
   Although Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater had said the conference
would run 15 or 20 minutes, noting that Bush had a cold and a raspy
voice, the president stood before the White House press corps for 43
minutes.
   ``I sound worse than I feel,'' Bush said as he stepped to the
podium.
   The session seemed to mark a departure from the pattern of Bush's
predecessor, President Reagan, whose news conferences were few and
far between. In his first week, Bush held an eight-minute
question-and-answer session with reporters in the Oval Office the
day after his inauguration, was interviewed for 12 minutes by two
reporters on behalf of the entire press corps and then conducted the
lengthy news conference.
   At one point Bush looked down at a digital watch on the podium
and laughingly counted down the seconds saying ``this thing is
buzzing away up here'' and suggesting he had to wrap things up.
   He then proceeded to take several more questions.
   At another juncture, following an answer he gave on Third World
debt, Bush admitted, ``I`m not sure I got to the substance of your
question there,'' and offered the reporter a chance to ask it again.
   The news conference at 11 a.m. EST Friday came as a surprise,
true to Bush's admitted efforts to keep the press corps off guard.
   It was announced by the White House press office on 15 minutes
notice, causing a scramble by camera crews, reporters and
photographers to set up in the room where Fitzwater conducts his
daily briefings.
   At one point Bush interrupted the flow to ask about the customary
practice of allowing follow-up questions by reporters after the
president answers their first one.
   He brought it up as a reporter sought a follow up a minimum-wage
question.
   ``Wait, let me ask you to stop the proceedings,'' Bush said
   ``What would be the fair and noble way to handle follow-up
questions as we do these things? Would it be good to have them or
not have them?'' Bush asked.
   Reporters said follow-ups are needed when the president doesn't
fully answer a question.
   ``You mean my first answer is less than precise?'' Bush said, to
chuckles.
   Gesturing to reporters lined up along the side of the room, he
noted that with the seated reporters getting two questions, ``the
standees have gotten no time at all.''
   Likewise, he said, referring to people sitting toward the back
near Dallas Morning News bureau chief Carl Leubsdorf, he said those
in ``the Leubsdorf area there (are) untested on the question.''
   The follow-ups became something of a running joke. When a
reporter shouted out a request to follow up on another person's
question on U.S.-Iran relations, Bush exclaimed in mock indignation,
``No, you don't get to follow his question!''
   A question about whether the president should limit pay raises
for his own staff if Congress approves a federal pay raise also
produced a light moment.
   Bush looked meaningfully over at senior staff members standing to
the side of the podium.
   Fitzwater, turning red, said laughingly, ``It's a trick question,
sir.''
   Bush did not flinch when asked a question that might have seemed
strange to many TV viewers.
   ``Did you find the note in your underwear drawer,'' a reporter
asked as part of a question on how his first week in the White House
had gone. A week earlier, Bush had indicated President Reagan, who
left him a written message in his Oval Office desk, might also have
left a note in the bedroom bureau.
   ``No note in the underwear, and it's been a good, easy week,''
Bush replied.

<TEXT>
   The FBI on Friday said it will convene a meeting
in Quantico, Va., of law enforcement agents from around the country
in hopes of clearing up unsolved murders believed to have been
committed by Ted Bundy.
   Terry Green, an FBI major case specialist, declined to say how
many would be invited to the meeting, ``designed to answer a lot of
questions that have come up about whether Bundy may have been
involved in their particular cases.''
   The meeting will take place within three weeks if the schedules
of various investigators allow it, Green said.
   ``It's easier to answer if everybody is in one place so we can
discuss the peculiarities in each case,'' he said.
   In the days before his execution, Bundy, 42, confessed to 23
murders, including three in Washington to which he had not been
linked. Investigators believe he may have committed as many as 100
slayings beginning in 1969.
   Bundy has been linked to murders, solved and unsolved, in Oregon,
Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Florida, Vermont, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   Green works in the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension office in
Quantico, Va., a clearinghouse for unsolved homicides. ``We collect
reports and put investigators in touch with each other so they can
have joint investigations,'' he said.
   He confirmed that Robert Keppel, an investigator for the
Washington state attorney general's office who tracked Bundy for
more than a decade, was invited.
   Bundy was executed Tuesday at Florida State Prison for the 1978
rape-murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake City, Fla. He was
also sentenced to die for the 1978 murders of two sorority sisters
at Florida State University.
   Bundy pursued young women and girls, many of whom had dark hair
parted in the middle. Prosecutors said he preyed on their sympathy,
often gaining their confidence by using crutches or an arm sling and
asking them to carry things for him.

<HEAD>Barry Lawsuit Charging Leaks Revived</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday revived a
lawsuit by Mayor Marion Barry Jr. in which he alleged that Joseph E.
diGenova, at the time the U.S. attorney for the District of
Columbia, leaked to the media testimony from grand jury probes into
possible corruption in Barry's administration.
   Barry's original suit, in which he sought to bar diGenova from
any further leaks to reporters, was dismissed by U.S. District Court
Judge Aubrey Robinson in 1987 after Robinson ruled that Barry had
failed to provide his contentions.
   Federal law stipulates that ``an attorney for the government ...
shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury.''
   On Friday, however, Judge Harry T. Edwards of the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia cited news stories quoting
``law-enforcement officials familiar with (Mayor Barry's)
testimony,'' and ruled that Barry had compiled enough evidence to
warrant granting him a hearing on the matter.
   Edwards' said diGenova and his associates must now respond,
``because they are in the best position to know whether (they are)
responsible for a violation'' of the rule barring grand jury leaks.
   The former U.S. attorney, now in private practice, said he would
not comment without reading the opinion.
   If, during the course of the hearing, diGenova or other federal
officials are found to have leaked grand jury testimony to the
media, they could face contempt of court charges. Edwards said,
however, that it was uncertain whether the officials could face
criminal or civil charges in connection with the matter.

   Michael Jackson, the androgynous whirling
dervish of pop music, is packing away his traveling clothes and
parking the tour bus.
   The reclusive creator of the moonwalk has said through surrogates
that his 16-month international ``Bad'' tour, set to wind up Friday
night with a sold-out show at the Sports Arena, will be his last.
   The 30-year-old Jackson, celebrated as widely for his
eccentricities as for his stunningly original songs, vocals and
choreography, intends to keep recording and is considering film
roles.
   ``I'm not saying he's not going to perform live again, but I
don't think we'll ever go out on tour like this,'' said Jackson's
manager, Frank Dileo.
   Jackson, who hasn't granted an interview since 1984, is said to
be interested in movies because of the transience of live
performance.
   ``He wants a medium that is more permanent,'' said concert
spokeswoman Maureen O'Connor. ``You do a show and after you do it,
it's over.''
   Friday night's concert comes exactly five years after the
singer's hair caught fire while he made a Pepsi commercial at the
nearby Shrine Auditorium. The accident, caused by an errant smoke
bomb, caused scalp burns.
   The concert was the last of four scheduled this month in Los
Angeles to make up for December dates Jackson canceled because of
strained vocal cords, apparently brought on by the rigors of the
tour.
   Catapulted into the public eye at age 5 with the Jackson Five
family pop group, Jackson has left his brothers behind to become a
one-man phenomenon.
   Fans and the tabloid press breathlessly follow the
eccentricities: his repeated cosmetic surgery, his menagerie of
exotic pets, his failed attempt to buy the bones of ``Elephant Man''
John Merrick.
   He won an unprecedented eight Grammy Awards for his ``Thriller''
album, which has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, the
most successful LP of all time.
   His ``Bad'' album has sold more than 19 million copies since its
1987 release. It is the first album to spawn five No. 1 hits.
   The ``Bad'' tour, which opened in Japan in September 1987, has
been seen by 4.4 million people in at least 15 countries and set a
box office record with more than $125 million in gross ticket sales.
   Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana attended one of his
shows at London's 72,000-seat Wembley Stadium. Jackson's June 18
performance at the Berlin Wall drew 65,000 West Germans, and police
wielding cattle prods were called to drive away 4,000 East Germans
who risked arrest to hear Jackson.

   Searchers used metal detectors Friday to
scour snow-covered sagebrush for the remains of a 15-year-old girl
whose grave Ted Bundy pinpointed 45 minutes before he died in the
electric chair.
   The search for Sue Curtis, who vanished in 1975 from the Brigham
Young University campus in Provo, was focused on three dirt roads
about 10 miles southeast of the city of Price, said Sheriff's Chief
Deputy Jerry Cowan.
   Searchers used metal detectors because the victim wore braces and
in case she was wearing jewelry.
   The detectors picked up faint signals, said Joe Ward, a member of
the search team, but the frozen ground covered with 10 inches of
snow was too hard to dig.
   ``The search will continue until the remains are found, but until
the snow melts it is doubtful we will have any success,'' said
Sheriff Barry Bryner.
   Ward also said he had remembered hunting in the area years ago _
possibly around the time of Curtis' disappearance _ and finding a
bloody pair of women's underwear. He said he didn't think much of it
at the time, but recalled it Friday and led searchers to a spot
about a quarter-mile from a dirt road.
   In the days before his execution Tuesday for the murder of a
12-year-old Florida girl, Bundy confessed to at least 23 murders in
Utah, Idaho, Washington and Colorado.
   The FBI said Friday that law-enforcement agents are being invited
to a meeting in Quantico, Va., in of clearing up murders Bundy is
believe to have committed.
   ``It's easier to answer if everybody is in one place so we can
discuss the peculiarities in each case,'' said Terry Green, an FBI
major case specialist.
   Using a page torn from an atlas, Bundy directed investigators to
look for Curtis' grave between Price and Green River. ``About 200
yards in on the dirt road ... and to the left, maybe 50 yards,
d, eleventh-hour confession, Bundy also said
he dumped another body into the Colorado River, identifying the
victim as Denise Oliverson, 24, who was last seen riding her bicycle
in April 1975 near her home in Grand Junction, Colo.
   Sgt. Greg Kuhn of the Grand Junction Police Department said that
officials will listen to the tape and talk to the investigator who
interviewed Bundy. Police probably will decide Monday whether to
search for the body, he said.
   In Idaho, authorities said they do not have enough information to
search for bodies in two killings Bundy said he committed.
   Russ Reneau, the Idaho investigator who interviewed Bundy over
the weekend in Florida, said Bundy confessed to killing Lynette
Culver, 12, and throwing her body into a river but could not provide
an exact location.
   Reneau said Bundy also confessed that in 1974 he picked up a
young woman at a freeway exit near Boise, killed her and threw the
body into a river. The victim's identity is unknown.
   Meanwhile, authorities in Wayne County, Utah, planned to scout a
site 10 miles east of Capital Reef National Park, where Bundy
claimed to have buried the body of Nancy Wilcox, 17, of Holladay,
who disappeared Oct. 2, 1974.
   A rancher told authorities that in 1974, he saw a man in a suit
standing along the road near the area Bundy detailed, and when he
drove by the man turned his back.
   The sheriff, the rancher and a few deputies were to check the
site and decide whether to mount a full-scale search, said Chief
Deputy Leeon Brinkerhoff.
   Bundy also said he buried the body of Debi Kent, who vanished in
1974 from a Bountiful, Utah, high school parking lot, between
Fairview and Mayfield. Bountiful Police Chief Larry Higgins said his
officers would visit the area Saturday.
   During an interview with a Utah detective last weekend, Bundy
mentioned eight killings in Utah, but authorities have been able to
link him to only five in the mid-1970s, when he was a University of
Utah law student.
   The Curtis girl had left a Mormon youth conference at the
church-owned school to walk to her dormitory room June 28, 1975, and
never was seen again.
   ``There were absolutely no leads as to where she was at,''
University Police Chief Robert Kelshaw said Friday.
   In the hour before his death, Bundy apparently requested a tape
recorder and a map from the Florida State Prison warden as he waited
in the ``ready cell'' 30 feet from the electric chair and described
the Curtis slaying.
   ``That's a typical pattern of Bundy _ unpredictable,'' said Salt
Lake County Sheriff Pete Hayward. ``Something struck a note in him,
I guess.''
   Cowan said the girl's parents live in Wellington, four miles from
the search area, and were ``just as upset as when it first
happened.''

   Solidarity leaders and top government
officials on Friday agreed to meet Feb. 6 for talks to address
political and economic freedom and the future of the banned
independent union.
   ``I am satisfied and very tired. I made hours of overtime,''
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told reporters waiting outside the
Roman Catholic Episcopate, where Walesa is staying.
   A joint communique announcing the date of the talks was carried
by the state-run news agency PAP.
   ``The meeting discussed the problems of trade union pluralism,
including Solidarity, and other problems which will be the subject
of the round-table talks,'' the communique said.
   It said a preliminary decision to set up three working teams for
economic and social policy, political reforms and union pluralism
had been taken.
   Participants also agreed to set up committees to deal with
agriculture, mining, reform of law and the courts, associations,
self-government, mass media and youth, the communique said.
   Walesa and a group of other Solidarity leaders and senior
advisers returned to the Episcopate by bus after holding nearly 12
hours of talks with government officials.
   They conferred in a secluded house in the woods of Magdalenka, a
Warsaw suburb, to lay the groundwork for the more elaborate
negotiations on such topics as political and economic freedom and
union pluralism.
   The last category will address the future of Solidarity, which
Walesa founded at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk during the labor
turmoil of August 1980.
   At first, the communist authorities accepted Solidarity as the
first free trade union in the Soviet bloc, but then suppressed and
outlawed it after martial law was imposed in 1981. Walesa, who won
the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, still works as an electrician at the
shipyard.
   Among those attending with Walesa were Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski
of Gdansk; Zbigniew Bujak, leader of the former Solidarity
underground; Mieczyslaw Gil, Solidarity chairman at the Nowa Huta
steel mill in Krakow, and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, a Solidarity leader
from Wroclaw in the southwest.
   Also in the group were three of Walesa's closest advisers:
Catholic journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, historian Bronislaw Geremek
and lawyer Andrzej Stelmachowski.
   The government did not identify its delegates, but national
Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said they included Interior
Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek
and the deputy chief of official trade unions, Romuald Sosnowski.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said Thursday the
main negotiations with opposition groups ``should begin in the next
few days.'' In response to a question, he called Feb. 5 ``very
probable,'' but then said that was a Sunday and Feb. 6 was more
likely.
   Jacek Moskwa, a spokesman for the opposition, said its
headquarters would be in space the Warsaw University administration
offered to a committee of activists Walesa formed in January.
   Walesa traveled to Warsaw by train Thursday and met with senior
advisers, but no details were released. Solidarity said he would
hold a news conference Saturday.
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's government made the offer of talks
with the opposition during strikes in August that were the worst in
Poland since martial law crushed Solidarity.
   Walesa has traveled to Warsaw four times for talks with senior
government officials. After the last meeting Nov. 19, he said he
would not agree to the larger negotiations until a political
decision was made to legalize the union.
   The Communist Party Central Committee made a dramatic policy
reversal on the matter last week, approving a proposal that more
than one legal trade union be permitted and opposition groups be
allowed to participate in government organizations.
   At a meeting Sunday in Gdansk, the Solidarity leadership agreed
to negotiate with the government on legalizing the union.

<HEAD>Soldiers Beat Workers; Hundreds Demonstrate In Gonaives</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers wielding billy clubs
brutally dispersed about 600 laid-off workers who had gathered
outside a government office Friday to collect severance pay, Radio
Haiti Inter said.
   In another development, several hundred youths set up barricades
of burning tires and shouted anti-government slogans Friday morning
in the northern port city of Gonaives before police scattered them
with tear gas, the independent station reported.
   The town returned to normal by early afternoon, the station said.
   Many residents of Gonaives, 100 miles north of Port-au-Prince,
were angered by the military government's decision last month to
crack down on smuggling, the livelihood of hundreds of middlemen in
Haiti's provincial port cities.
   Since a nationwide 24-hour general strike paralyzed most of Haiti
on Jan. 17, small, sporadic anti-government demonstrations and
strikes have erupted in several small provincial towns, called by
teachers demanding back pay, truckers demanding road repairs and
youths denouncing unpopular officials.
   The 600 workers in Port-au-Prince, mostly women, were recently
laid off by Amtex Inc., an assembly plant. They gathered in front of
a Social Affairs Ministry branch office in Delmas, on the capital's
north side, to negotiate severance pay.
   In what appeared to be an unprovoked attack, two truckloads of
soldiers from the notoriously repressive Dessalines Barracks arrived
and beat people with billy clubs, bruising many and bludgeoning a
pregnant woman, Haiti Inter said.
   No one was arrested, and no serious injuries were reported, the
radio said.
   Social Affairs Minister Arnold Guerrier said he was investigating
the incident.

<HEAD>Bush: Big Plans for Baker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday Secretary of State
James A. Baker III would advance ``bold, new initiatives'' in
foreign policy.
   At a ceremonial swearing-in in the East Room of the White House,
Bush praised his longtime friend and fellow Texan, saying, ``he's
savvy, he's sensitive, he's tough.''
   Before an audience of about 200 persons, including congressional
leaders and family members, Baker took the oath of office
administered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
   Actually, the ceremony was just for show. Baker actually was
sworn in Wednesday night in a short ceremony at the State Department
following his Senate confirmation.
   Presiding at that ceremony was deputy executive White House clerk
Daniel J. Marks.
   Bush called Friday's ceremony ``a very special occasion for me,''
citing a friendship with Baker that began in Houston in the 1960s.
   ``I have great confidence in him. And, judging from the way he
sailed through the confirmation process, the United States Senate
shares that confidence,'' he said.
   He said Baker would be ``my principal foreign policy adviser.''
   In brief remarks, Bush recalled his pledge in his inaugural for a
``new engagement.''
   ``Nowhere is the need for new engagement greater than in foreign
policy,'' he said. ``The world demands new strategies and new
solutions.''
   Saying that ``totalitarian forces still threaten to undermine the
will of the people,'' Bush said: ``We must keep democracy on the
march.''
   ``This is the time for America to reach out and take the lead,
not merely react,'' he said, describing Baker's role as ``leading,
coming up with bold new initiatives.''
   Baker, noting he and Bush had ``come a long distance together,''
said the more he learns about the job, ``the more humble I become.''
   ``We're entering a new era of international relations, one that's
filled with more than its share of promise and perhaps more than its
share of perils as well,'' Baker said.
   Baker, who served as chief of staff and Treasury secretary in the
Reagan administration, joked that from experience he knows that
``after the swearing-in, comes the swearing at.''
   He also said he hoped he and Bush would do better as a
foreign-policy team ``than we did on the tennis courts in Texas.''

<HEAD>Stepfather Admits 2nd Assault of Leukemia Victim While On Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who pleaded guilty in September to sexually
assaulting his leukemia-stricken 9-year-old stepdaughter has
admitted molesting her again while awaiting sentencing.
   The 31-year-old man admitted the offense in court Thursday in an
agreement with the prosecutor not to press charges. Prosecutor
Marshall Gandy said he agreed in order to spare the sick girl the
rigors of testifying at a trial.
   The first assault occurred as the child was resting from a
chemotherapy session that left her weakened, authorities said.
   The second assault took place Nov. 1 when the man, under court
order to stay away from the girl, was babysitting her, according to
testimony Thursday. At the time, the man was free on $5,000 bail,
set by a magistrate.
   Two caseworkers with the Texas Department of Human Services had
testified in October that the man was likely to be a repeat offender.
   Prosecutors criticized District Judge Frances J. Maloney for
twice delaying sentencing after the September guilty plea. The judge
did not return telephone calls Friday.
   After the second offense, Maloney ordered the man jailed on
$500,000 bail. The stepfather's name has not been released to
protect the identity of the girl.
   Aggravated sexual assault of a child is a punishable by life in
prison.
   Maloney, who delayed sentencing in September pending a
psychological review of the man and delayed it again because of
scheduling conflicts, on Thursday set sentencing for Feb. 13, this
time at defense attorney Fred Talkington's request.
   Talkington said he sought the delay so he could schedule
testimony from a psychologist. The defense attorney said he will
seek probation for the man because prison offers nothing ``that can
help him with this problem.''

   Police arrested a suspect Friday in the
shooting of four high school students that a victim said erupted
because of an argument over a chair in the school cafeteria.
   Rodney Reardon, 18, of Washington, was charged with assault with
attempt to murder in the incident that occurred Thursday as shots
were fired into a crowd of students outside Woodrow Wilson High
School in an affluent Washington neighborhood.
   An affadavit presented at Reardon's arraignment in D.C. Superior
Court said that Reardon was one of two gunmen who pulled out
handguns and began firing. The document said authorities believe
Reardon was in a group of ``at least four males'' who approached the
students. Police are still searching for the other suspects.
   Lazario Santa Cruz, 16, a student wounded in the shooting, said a
non-student who had taken a friend's seat during the lunch break
challenged the friend to a fight.
   Santa Cruz said in an interview with WUSA-TV that the Wilson
students were ambushed in front of the building after school.
   ``Some boys turned around and started shooting at us _ just
started shooting into the crowd,'' he said. ``The first shot hit me
right in my face, and I was just laying down, and they were just
shooting people in their legs.''
   ``They were shooting at anybody, because a lot of people (who)
didn't have nothing to do with it got shot,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, security at the school was increased.
   ``We're taking extra precautions to make sure that security is
here,'' said school system spokesman Charles Seigel. ``We're trying
to make this as normal a day as possible.''
   Attendance was light, as only those taking make-up semester
examinations were scheduled to attend, but no exact attendance
figures were immediately available. The final day of semester exams
was Thursday.
   Principal Michael Durso told a morning assembly, ``Perhaps out of
a very negative incident, and out of a very negative situation, we
can draw some positives out of it.''
   Santa Cruz was released from the hospital Friday after treatment
for a bullet wound to his lip. Two other students also were released
and a fourth victim was listed in stable condition.

<HEAD>Angolan Official Denies Contact With Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Angolan official on Friday denied
reports that his country's Marxist government held direct talks with
a guerrilla movement supported by the United States and South Africa.
   But the official, Antonio dos Santos Franca, Angola's deputy
defense minister, said ``elements'' of the guerrilla group had
contact with the government about its policy of clemency and
national reconciliation, Portuguese Radio Commercial reported.
   The Angolan government repeatedly has denied contacts with
officials the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
UNITA has fought the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
since losing a civil war after Angola won independence from Portugal
in 1975.
   Alcides Sakala, a guerrilla spokesman in Lisbon, also said Angola
and UNITA had no formal contacts.
   ``We have to establish official contacts to solve the internal
problem (in Angola), and the sooner the better,'' he said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   News reports here have suggested that informal talks between the
government and the rebels followed the U.S.-brokered negotiations
that led Angola, Cuba and South Africa to sign peace accords on Dec.
22.
   Cuba agreed to withdraw its troops backing the Angolan
government, and South Africa, which supplies arms to the Angolan
rebels, agreed to relinquish control of neighboring Namibia.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa had reported that dos Santos
Franca said in Lisbon on Thursday that ``there have to be contacts,
it's not a conversation between two ghosts.''
   ``We are trying to initiate an immediate dialogue, we are trying
to start this whole process,'' Lusa quoted dos Santos Franca as
saying Thursday, but it added the deputy minister gave no details.
   The government offers clemency to rebels who renounce the
guerrilla group, but Angolan government officials have yet to meet
with rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   Continued clashes between the Angolan government and the rebels
have claimed almost 200 lives since mid-January, statements released
Friday said.
   Angola's state news agency ANGOP said government troops killed 73
rebels in clashes nationwide from Jan. 18 through Jan. 24.
   A statement issued by the rebels claimed they killed 114
government soldiers in fighting in the provinces of Huambo,
Benguela, South Kuanza and Uige.
   In a separate statement released earlier in Lisbon, the rebels
claimed their forces killed 41 government fighters in a two other
battles in Benguela and Bie on Jan. 18 and 19. The rebels suffered
one dead and four wounded, the statement said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday a four-mile
ditch being planned along the U.S.-Mexican border near San Diego
could keep out about 80 percent of vehicles crossing illegally into
the United States in that area.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said illegal crossings in that area,
east of San Ysidro, Calif., have led to ``hot pursuits, accidents,
one accidental death and serious injuries to undocumented aliens.''
   He said the Border Patrol has observed as many as 369 entries a
month in the area and that the ditch could prevent about 300 such
crossings.
   Redman added that the ditch would also resolve problems caused by
drainage from new developments on the U.S. side.
   He drew laughter from reporters when he said the name of the plan
is ``dual purpose border security enhancement project and drainage
ditch.''
   ``The plan is currently undergoing environmental impact
assessment,'' he added.
   In Mexico, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday it had been told
the ditch was designed to carry drainage, not to deter unauthorized
vehicles.
   ``The Mexican government was not told the purpose of this
construction could be to control migration, or anything else of that
nature,'' a government statement said.
   Redman said the Mexican government had been kept apprised of the
dual purpose of the project through the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Asked about objections by the Mexican
government, he said, ``We have kept the Mexican government
informed.''
   Several Mexican congressmen reacted angrily to the proposal,
calling it ``unfriendly'' and saying it would not stop the flow of
illegal immigrants.
   In the United States, immigrant rights activists called it
``repressive'' and ``ill-conceived.''

<HEAD>Study Says 16 Percent of Employers Discriminating</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers are discriminating against
``foreign-looking'' job seekers at an ``alarmingly high level'' and
many businesses don't understand the 1986 immigration changes, 10
congressmen said Friday.
   The lawmakers based their complaints on a study by the General
Accounting Office that found 16 percent of employers surveyed
admitted to engaging in discriminatory hiring practices, such as
asking only ``foreign-looking'' people for work authorization
documents and hiring only U.S. citizens.
   The GAO, an investigating arm of Congress, estimated this means
as many as 528,000 employers nationwide are engaging in unfair
employment practices, the congressmen said in a letter to Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.
   The study also found that 22 percent of 4.2 million employers in
the GAO survey population were not aware of the sanctions against
knowingly hiring undocumented workers, and of those who were aware
of the law, 20 percent did not understand its major provisions.
   ``There seems to be a strong relationship between lack of
information on employer sanctions and discriminatory behavior,'' the
congressmen said.
   While the 1986 immigration reform law bars employers from hiring
undocumented workers, it makes it against the law for employers to
discriminate against eligible job seekers.
   ``We are especially concerned about the GAO's claim that its
findings do not show a `pattern' of discrimination,'' the
congressmen told Thornburgh. ``This interpretation, in our view, is
less important than the report's clear evidence that discrimination
is occurring at an alarmingly high level. This is an unacceptable
situation.''
   Signing the letter were Democratic Reps. Albert Bustamante of
Texas; Esteban Torres, Ronald Dellums, Edward Roybal, Mervyn
Dymally, Robert Matsui, Norman Mineta, and Matthew Martinez of
California; and Edolphus Towns and Robert Garcia of New York.
   Also signing were Democrats Jaime Fuster, Puerto Rico's
congressional resident commissioner, and Ron de Lugo, congressional
delegate from the Virgin Islands.

   Arthur Marshall, whose benign humor endeared him to
an audience of millions in half a lifetime of radio and TV
broadcasts, died Friday at the age of 78, the British Broadcasting
Corp. said.
   Marshall's very English style, with its joy in the humor of words
and the eccentricities of people, made him a household name.
   He died in his sleep after a long fight against cancer, at his
home in the south Devon village of Christow, near Exeter, south of
London, the BBC said.
   Marshall was also a journalist, contributing to the New Statesman
magazine for 46 years until what he called the ``discontinuance'' of
his ``whimsical jottings'' in 1981.
   In 1978 he joined the popular BBC-TV word game ``Call My Bluff,''
where he and other panelists tried to fool each other with fake
definitions of obscure words.
   His round, bespectacled face smiled mischievously from millions
of television sets around the country each week.
   ``His wit and gentility had enormous appeal,'' BBC official James
Moir said Friday.
   Program host Robert Robinson called him ``rotund and cherubic ...
one of the most likeable men I have ever met.''
   Fellow panelist Frank Muir said he was ``an extraordinary man,
extremely intelligent with that old English tradition of polite,
sentimental humor. ... His was the true alternative comedy in an era
of television humor which has become aggressive, impertinent and
fairly offensive.''
   Marshall, reared in southwest London, attended the respected
Oundle School and returned there as a teacher of French and German
from 1931-54 _ except for the war years, when he worked in
intelligence.
   His classroom experiences formed the basis of much of his humor,
and he found early success with sketches impersonating elderly
schoolmistresses.
   After his first broadcast in 1934 he made records, and later
introduced new characters called Nurse Dugdale and Miss Pringle.
   His wrote humorous essays, reviews and an autobiography called,
``Life's Rich Pageant.''
   He never married.
   Robinson spoke of Marshall's stoicism about his illness.
   ``He had his hip replaced, that was followed by two heart
attacks, then the cancer from which he died. But the only thing he
said which was anything remotely self-pitying was, `It is not to be
recommended.'''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court says the Army
Corps of Engineers may install a controversial type of turbine at a
hydroelectric dam but can't use the equipment until an environmental
lawsuit is settled.
   In a decision issued in Richmond, Va., on Tuesday, the court gave
the corps the go-ahead to proceed with construction on the $57.2
million project on the Richard Russell Dam.
   But the court left intact a lower-court injunction against
testing or using the turbines once they are installed.
   The dam is on the Savannah River on the Georgia-South Carolina
border, roughly 75 northwest of Augusta, Ga.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the South Carolina
Wildlife Department, the National Wildlife Federation and the
federation's South Carolina and Georgia affiliates.
   They had sought to keep the ``pump-storage'' turbines out of the
dam altogether, arguing that the devices, which send water that
flows through them back over a dam to generate additional
electricity, can cause widespread fish kills.
   In May, U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins issued an injunction
blocking both installation and use of the turbines until a
supplemental environmental impact statement is completed. The corps
appealed the injunction.
   But the three-member appeals panel said installation alone will
cause no environmental damage.
   Jim Parker, spokesman for the Army Corps' Savannah District, said
the agency is ``pleased to be able to move forward with the
installation.'' He said the corps believes it will be able to
operate the turbines without hurting the environment.
   Ellison Smith, attorney for the environmentalists, said the order
means the court still has review power over the project.
   The corps ``can do everything but turn them on and test them,''
he said.
   Parker said corps officials will meet next week to get a better
idea of when the project, originally scheduled for completion next
year, might be finished and how much the delay has cost.

<HEAD>Texas Thrift Customers Questioning Proposed Depositor Fee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loans are on alert for withdrawals by
jittery customers fearing a tax on deposits to help bail out the
thrift industry, and a top regulator said Thursday the proposal is
scaring depositors away.
   A spot check of Dallas savings and loans depositors on Friday
suggested that most customers would wait and see if the proposed fee
was adopted before taking any action. But many people had questions
about the idea.
   Judy Rollerson, a Metropolitan Savings teller, said several
customers mentioned the proposal but none said they would close
their accounts.
   ``They don't think it will really happen,'' she said. ``They're
just talking about how preposterous it really is.''
   S&amp;L officials have been watching for reaction since the Bush
administration hinted that one way to finance a bailout of troubled
thrifts would be to charge S&amp;L, bank and credit union customers 25
cents on every $100 they had deposited.
   The measure would require Congressional approval.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said
Thursday that the proposal was making savings and loan depositors
nervous and had led some to withdraw their money.
   Since Wednesday, Wall said, ``There have been cases where they
say, `I don't like what I heard on TV, I'm taking my money out.'''
   Depositors' reaction to the proposal had not put any savings and
loans in jeopardy, he said.
   Financial industry officials in Dallas and their customers said
there have been few account closings as a result of the deposit tax
trial balloon.
   ``We've had a few questions to it,'' said Ruth Lack, spokeswoman
for First Gibraltar, FSB in Houston. ``We have not had any action on
it. Most of our depositors realize that this is nothing more than a
trial at this point.''
   George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas, said publicity about the proposal caused ``no measurable
increase'' in withdrawals because consumers are confident the
government will uphold the safety of their deposits.
   Some customers said they probably would withdraw their money if
the deposit fee was implemented, but several customers said they had
not heard about the proposal.
   One Dallas man promptly withdrew his money from Sunbelt Savings
after hearing of the fee proposal, said account representative Tim
Palla.
   ``He came in with a smile on his face and said, `I can't handle
this any more. It isn't you people, it's the government,'' Palla
said.
   Palla said that was the only withdrawal he knew of. Other
customers have called with questions about the proposed fee, he said.

   A dead man slumped in a van parked near City

   Police said they will investigate why Leonard Hobson, 67, of
Durant, was unobserved for so long. No foul play is suspected in the
death.
   A meter maid discovered him Friday morning.
   Lt. Charles Owen said the inquiry is routine. ``We're not blaming
anybody, certainly not our meter maids,'' he said. ``The meter maids
are not commissioned police officers,'' he said. ``They are
civilians and that, too, will be considered. Outside of being a
trained observer, we don't really expect them to make any type of
investigations.''
   Hobson was found slumped against the passenger's side door.
Authorities said the preliminary investigation showed the man may
have died Monday night.
   The tickets dated to Tuesday.
   Capt. Bob Jones said Hobson had business at the Oklahoma County
Courthouse and had a long history of illness. Medication was found
on the front seat.
   Jones said the parking tickets would be canceled.

   Police have raided 50 homes as
they hunt for a prominent leftist extremist who led an assault on an
infantry base that left 38 people dead, officials said Friday.
   The government said it believes Monday's attack was led by
Enrique Gorriaran Merlo, who claimed he took part in the Sept. 17,
1980, assassination of deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   ``His participation is presumed, taking into account his former
guerrilla activity, his training and the connection he had in recent
times with (leftist groups),'' said Attorney General Andres
D'Alessio.
   Gorriaran Merlo, 47, is a former leader of the Peoples
Revolutionary Army leftist group that battled Argentina's army in
open combat in the 1970s. The guerrilla army was decimated.
   Gorriaran Merlo has been wanted by Argentine police for years.
President Raul Alfonsin ordered his prosecution shortly after taking
office five years ago, but the guerrilla was thought to have fled
the country.
   On Monday, about 60 heavily armed civilian commandos burst onto
and briefly controlled the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada on
the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Hundreds of soldiers routed the band
after a 27-hour battle in which 28 guerrillas were killed and 18
captured. Ten police and soldiers also died.
   ``We know that in this attack more people participated than were
killed or arrested,'' D'Alessio said. Acknowledging public concerns
that the group might strike again, he added:
   ``We know that an armed group that suffers a public defeat of
this size in general sees it as necessary to do something to
demonstrate it's still in condition to keep operating.''
   Alfonsin blamed the attack on leftist subversives, basing the
charge in part on the identification of bodies of those arrested as
former members of the Peoples Revolutionary Army.
   Two of the 17 men and three women who were captured Monday and
Tuesday have been released, D'Alessio said, and two others have been
jailed as a result of the raids.
   Police said they raided 50 homes since the attack and intend to
seek information and evidence in at least 100 other homes.
   Weapons were seized at some of the homes, D'Alessio said. At
least a dozen people picked up for questioning have been released.
   Arrest warrants have been issued for five people, including
Gorriaran Merlo, D'Alessio said. He would not identify the other
four.

<TEXT>
   State officials have fired the only
paid chaplain at a juvenile detention center in Westfield, saying
the state can no longer afford to pay him $49.20 pay for a one-hour,
weekly counseling session.
   ``It's not the $49.20, but the shabby treatment of the chaplaincy
that bothers me,'' the Rev. Benjamin Lockhart, a 71-year-old retired
minister who served the lockup for 27 years, said Friday.
   ``We are engaged in a serious piece of business and it kind of
makes you wonder what people think is important when they will pay a
painter, but not a clergyman,'' he said.
   George Ashwell, a Division of Youth Services administrator in
Springfield who oversees the Westfield center, said Lockhart, who
puts in about an hour a week, was the only contract employee let go
at the detention center because of cuts in consultant budget
accounts ordered by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   The cuts are part of a package of measures proposed by Dukakis to
help the state meet a $600 million shortfall in the current fiscal
year's $11.2 billion budget.
   ``I do not feel that the general public wants the budget to be
balanced on the backs of the chaplains,'' Lockhart said in a letter
to center officials, the governor and state legislators. ``Westfield
Detention Center, which deals with troubled youth, needs more, not
less chaplaincy service.''
   Ashwell said that one other Protestant clergyman has served as a
volunteer at the Westfield center and lay members of other church
groups have also visited the youths.
   The detention center houses 24 juveniles facing criminal charges.
   Elizabeth Dowd, a spokeswoman for youth services Commissioner
Edward J. Loughran, said Friday that because of the state's fiscal
crisis, the department had to eliminate ``a number of managerial and
other employees.''
   ``We felt that since (Lockhart) only spent an hour a week at the
facility and the services were covered by other volunteers, we could
eliminate that contract,'' Dowd said.
   She said that she did not know how many employees had been fired,
but she believed chaplains for at least two other institutions were
also let go.
   Lockhart agreed that the session he spends with troubled youths
lasts only about an hour, but said he was angry that ``they sent me
a letter on Saturday telling me not to show up on Sunday.''
   He charged that when he went to the youth home last Sunday as a
volunteer, he was barred from entering, which Ashwell denied.
   After formal Protestant and Catholic services were discontinued
at the youth center some time ago, Lockhart said, he instead met
weekly with from four to eight youths.
   ``We would talk about various things out of the Bible,'' he said.
``You try to bring hope to them, turn them around. These people have
fouled up their lives and they need someone to help them get back.
But if you are on the outside you can't do that.''
   Lockhart served as minister of a Baptist church in Agawam for
many years and prior to his retirement, he was Protestant chaplain
at the Hampden County jail for 30 years.

<HEAD>Energy Department Denies Seeking To Ease Nuclear Safety Rule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department denied Friday it is
considering lowering a safety standard to make it easier to restart
a South Carolina nuclear reactor that produces a scarce gas needed
to make nuclear warheads.
   Gary Pitchford, a department spokesman at the Savannah River
Plant near Aiken, S.C., said ``some in the department'' have
supported the idea of changing the safety standard, but not as a
means of speeding the reactor restart.
   Pitchford stressed that other persons in the department opposed
the change in safety standards, and the idea is not being considered
in connection with a Savannah River restart. He and other officials
said the idea has been studied for several years both at Savannah
River and in the commercial nuclear industry.
   ``There is no consideration being given to changing the (safety
standard) for the restart of the `K' reactor,'' Pitchford said in a
telephone interview. The ``K'' reactor was shut down last spring to
make repairs and to retrain operators.
   The New York Times, in its Friday editions, reported that the
chairman of a nuclear safety advisory panel had told a Senate
committee the Energy Department was considering relaxing the safety
standard in order to speed the reopening of reactors at Savannah
River, which is the nation's only source of tritium.
   Tritium is a perishable gas that is critical to the production of
nuclear warheads. Savannah River has been unable to produce tritium
since last spring, and the Energy Department has said the plant may
not be reopened before year's end.
   The plant is operated under Energy Department contract by E.I. du
Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.
   The Times quoted John Ahearne as saying the department's office
at Savannah River was ``trying very hard to make the case'' that the
current definition of the worst possible reactor accident _ a
complete break in a cooling pipe _ was unrealistic. Ahearne was
reported to have said department officials proposed that the minimum
safety standard be based on the danger posed by a leak in the pipe
rather than a full break.
   The ``leak-before-break'' standard, if applied at Savannah River,
would make it easier for du Pont _ and Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
which takes over as operator April 1 _ to get Energy Department
approval for a reactor restart plan.
   In a telephone interview on Friday, however, Ahearne said he had
told the Senate panel that du Pont officials _ not the Energy
Department _ were pushing for adoption of the ``leak-before-break''
safety standard. He also said he had not asserted that the du Pont
plan was aimed at speeding up the reactor restart.
   Ahearne said department safety officials were ``very, very
skeptical'' of the idea.
   Clif Webb, a du Pont spokesman at Savannah River, said Friday
that the company had been studying the ``leak-before-break''
question for a few years but had not yet reached an official
corporate position on whether it should be applied at Savannah River.
   Webb also denied that the study was aimed at speeding up the
reactor reopening.
   Ahearne, chairman of the Energy Department's Advisory Committee
on Nuclear Facility Safety, said his panel last December had
reviewed du Pont's scientific work and concluded it was ``a long
way'' from justifying the lower safety standard.

<HEAD>Japan Rips Tower Attack On Defense Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan on Friday criticized U.S. Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower's call for more pressure on Tokyo to
increase its military spending and said the country is doing its
share to bolster its defense.
   Tower's remarks during Senate confirmation hearings virtually
guaranteed that the issue of Japan's share of the burden for its
defense will come up during Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
Washington visit next week.
   ``U.S.-Japan defense arrangements have been a pillar of Japan's
security and we have been making efforts toward our defense under
this framework, and such a policy has been widely trusted by the
people,'' Defense Agency Director General Kichiro Tazawa told
reporters.
   Tazawa said Tower's comment that Japan could greatly increase its
defense spending despite its constitution, which restricts its
military to defensive capabilities, reflected a lack of
understanding of the Japanese perspective.
   ``I regret that Mr. Tower went so far as to refer to our
constitution to push us to expand our defense spending,'' Tazawa
said.
   A senior Foreign Ministry official said there was no need for
Takeshita to apologize for Japan's defense spending, given its
recent efforts to increase its military and overseas development
assistance budgets.
   ``The government's proposal for the new budget has a remarkable
5.9 percent increase in the defense budget and 7.8 percent for
(foreign aid). We are doing very fine in our own view,'' said Yukio
Okamoto, director of the Foreign Ministry's First North American
division.
   Washington has urged Japan to do more for its own defense _
especially to improve its ability to defend crucial sea-lanes _ but
military spending is controversial here. The Japanese constitution,
adopted in 1946 during the U.S. occupation, renounces war and
forbids the use of force in settling international disputes.
   In confirmation hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee
on Wednesday, Tower said the decision to inflict a constitution that
severely restrained Japan from building a substantial military force
during the U.S. occupation was ``a lousy idea.''
   ``But I don't believe that constitution is so restraining that
they couldn't devote a substantially larger percentage (of spending)
to their defense,'' Tower said.
   Japan has been steadily building up its armed forces in recent
years. The government this week approved a budget for fiscal 1989
that includes $30.5 billion for defense spending. The budget must be
passed by Parliament.
   The new budget raises Tokyo's share of the cost of keeping 55,000
U.S. troops in Japan to $1.11 billion, about 75 percent of the total
cost.
   Its economic assistance to developing countries is likely to
exceed $11 billion, making it the world's largest donor of foreign
aid.
   By 1990, Japan's defense spending, which is increasing more than
5 percent annually, will exceed that of most of the European allies,
a Pentagon official said recently.
   The proposed 1989 defense budget amounts to slightly more than 1
percent of Japan's gross national product. The United States devotes
about 6 percent to military spending and the European allies 3
percent to 4 percent.
   He said the U.S.-Japan summit next week was intended mainly to
allow Bush and Takeshita to develop closer relations and discuss
global issues. He said Takeshita did not expect to discuss specific
issues with Bush.
   ``We think there is a full understanding of our policy by the
U.S. government,'' Okamoto said. ``We will continue to point to our
record of success in this field.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Airline Eligible for Civil Damages to Ex-Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines is liable for civil damages
to 3,000 former flight attendants who were replaced when they went
on strike in 1986, a federal judge has ruled.
   ``We're ecstatic,'' plaintiffs' attorney Robert Balfour said
Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Ilana Rovner set the stage for a hearing on
damages with her ruling Thursday. No date for the hearing was set,
but Balfour said attorneys for both sides would meet with Ms. Rovner
on Wednesday.
   The telephone went unanswered at the airline's corporate offices
in Mount Cisco, N.Y., after business hours and no spokesmen were
available at TWA's St. Louis office.
   The flight attendants' 1986 class-action lawsuit seeks $80
million from the airline, contending TWA hindered their efforts to
find work with other carriers during and after a 1986 strike.
   The lawsuit sought both compensatory and punitive damages, but
the judge denied the request to seek a punitive award, Balfour said.
However, he called $80 million ``still a realistic figure.''
   More than 5,700 members of New York-based Independent Federation
of Flight Attendants struck TWA on Feb. 13, 1986, and were told
their jobs would be filled by others.
   Under the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, furloughed or fired
workers with at least four years' experience must be given
preference over newcomers by other carriers. The law required TWA to
give the striking attendants letters certifying they had such
experience and were eligible for first consideration by other
airlines.
   The flight attendants' lawsuit contends TWA refused to issue such
letters to strikers on grounds the move would jeopardize their jobs
at TWA. It says the airline also refused to advise the attendants
they were eligible for preferential hiring.
   TWA maintained that stance when the strike was over, the lawsuit
says.
   When no contract agreement had been reached with TWA by May 17,
1986, the union made an unconditional offer to return to work. But
just 197 of the strikers got their jobs back.
   Nearly 1,300 attendants crossed picket lines, according to court
records. Others found jobs at other airlines or left the industry.
   While the flight attendants' union was not involved in the court
action, officials were pleased with Ms. Rovner's ruling, union
spokeswoman Joan Wages said Friday from New York.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen on Friday assassinated a
provincial governor who was also the provincial leader of the
governing Christian Democratic Party, a judicial source said.
   Gov. Jose Ernesto Flores of Usulutan province was killed by
machine gun fire in Jucuapa, 68 miles east of the national capital,
said the magistrate of Jucuapa, who did not want to be identified by
name.
   Ernesto Flores, 40, was appointed governor of the eastern
province last year by President Jose Napoleon Duarte after serving
as mayor of Villa El Triunfo in Usulutan.
   No individual or group immediately claimed responsibility.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebel movement,
known by its Spanish acronym of FMLN, frequently has claimed
responsibility for assassinating local officials because of their
cooperation with Duarte's U.S.-backed government.
   The FMLN has been fighting since 1979 to topple the U.S.-backed
Salvadoran government.
   After killing eight mayors last year, the guerrillas sent death
threats to local leaders to demand their resignations. Since last
May, more than 70 among the nations' 262 mayors have resigned.
   Also Friday, guerrillas destroyed a truck used for transporting
eggs in retribution for the government's alleged detention of two
union leaders on Thursday. However, the government would not confirm
that it had arrested the union leaders.
   ``We demand the freedom of our two union companions,'' the rebels
said in a radio broadcast. They warned of further actions if Alfredo
Lemus and Margarita Navarro, leaders in the national labor movement,
are not freed.
   Sixty union members occupied San Salvador's Metropolitan
Cathedral on Thursday night through Friday morning in protest of the
alleged arrests.
   Union officials said they would increase their protests for what
they described as the ``illegal'' arrest of their members.
   The union leaders were taken into custody Thursday afternoon in
Soyapango, outside San Salvador, while distributing union leaflets,
according to various union activists who were with the two.

<TEXT>
   The Army on Friday ordered its fleet of CH-47D
Chinook helicopters temporarily grounded for the one-time
installation of safety equipment that service officials say will
help protect flight control tubes against fire.
   The grounding is the third in the last two months for the Chinook.
   The Army said the ``safety of flight message'' ordering the
grounding stemmed from a continuing review of accidents involving
the twin-rotor chopper over the past year.
   In two of those accidents that resulted in loss of life, a fire
was able to spread from the rear of the aircraft to the front along
a hollow tunnel that runs the length of the fuselage carrying
aluminum ``control tubes.''
   The control tubes provide the linkage between the flight controls
in the cockpit and the helicopter's two rotor blades.
   The service is now ordering its mechanics, with the assistance of
teams from prime contractor Boeing Co., to install a ``fiberglass
fire protection sleeve'' around the control tubes.
   The goal, according to an Army spokesman, is to make sure the
control tubes remain intact long enough in case of fire for a pilot
to land the chopper.
   ``This doesn't eliminate the possibility of fire, but we think
this can improve crew survivability,'' said Lt. Col. John Reitz, the
spokesman.
   Reitz, in discussing Friday's action, disclosed the service had
issued an earlier grounding order Jan. 10 that instructed mechanics
to make sure a special fire-retardant paint had been applied to the
control tubes.
   All but 21 of the Army's 240 CH-47D's remain grounded for
inspections under that earlier order, the spokesman said.
   ``We're being cautious at this point and we've decided to add
this extra margin of safety,'' he continued. ``And we decided to do
it now since the helicopters are already down.''
   Reitz said the Army expected the work to take ``30 days or less''
for the entire fleet.
   The Army initially grounded its Chinook fleet Dec. 23 after
receiving a special advisory from Boeing. In that case, the Army
ordered an inspection to determine whether all of the transmissions
had been properly assembled during production.
   That grounding ended Jan. 3 with the Army reporting it had not
found any faulty transmissions.
   Ten CH-47D's have been involved in accidents since 1985, and 16
soldiers were killed in incidents involving the helicopter in 1988.
   Last Feb. 25, 11 soldiers were killed in a Chinook crash near
Chico, Texas. And in the most recent accident, five servicemen were
killed in a crash in Honduras on Dec. 8.
   In both the Chico and Honduras accidents, the helicopter's crew
had to deal with an on-board fire _ apparently caused by different
problems. In both cases, however, the fire spread from the rear of
the aircraft to the front along the control tube tunnel, Reitz said.
   While the evidence is not conclusive, it appears both pilots may
have lost control of their helicopters before hitting the ground, he
continued.
   It was that finding that prompted the Jan. 10 grounding to ensure
the control tubes had been painted with fire retardant paint and
which is now prompting the order to install the nylon sleeves, the
spokesman said.
   The Chinook is a twin-engine, twin-rotor helicopter that the Army
classifies as its ``medium lift'' aircraft. It can carry a payload
of 16,000 pounds or ferry 33 soldiers into combat.
   The first CH-47D entered Army service in 1979, replacing older
CH-47 models. The Army is gradually replacing another 146 older
Chinooks with the ``D'' model, which has more powerful engines and
transmissions, fiberglass rotor blades and advanced flight control
systems.

<TEXT>
   A congressman, after touring the scene of Miami's
three nights of riots, promised Friday to turn around the ``legacy
of broken promises'' to the area and help secure federal funds.
   ``The injustice here is so profound that everyone in America
knows there's something very wrong here,'' said U.S. Rep. John
Conyers, D-Michigan.
   Conyers, chairman of the Government Operations Committee and a
member of the Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional
rights, said he was on a quest for justice.
   ``There are too many trigger-happy policemen abusing the rights
of black people in this area,'' said Conyers, who was invited to
Miami by Raymond Fauntroy, head of the local Southern Christian
Leadership Conference chapter.
   Conyers said he would help coordinate relief for predominantly
black Overtown, where the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by
a Hispanic police officer a week ago triggered three days of
burning, looting and violence.
   The unrest spilled over into the Liberty City area, and left one
dead, 11 wounded by gunfire and about $1 million damage to buildings.
   ``Overtown has been shorted,'' Conyers said. ``The question is
how did it happen and what we can do.''
   Earlier, the congressman met with Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, who
called Conyers a ``foremost expert on the issue of race relations.''
   Conyers also met with about 125 residents at a meeting held on
the same block where the riots broke out.
   He said at the meeting that federal aid promised by the Carter
administration after the 1980 riots, which were sparked by the
beating death of a black motorcyclist by police officers, was cut by
the Reagan administration.
   For example, he said of $40 million in loans promised for small
business owners, $16 million was sent. He said of $10 million for
low-income housing, $2 million was sent.
   At the meeting, Patricia Lloyd, sister of the slain motorcyclist,
said said the officer who shot her brother Clement should face a
charge more serious than manslaughter. ``I'd like to see him charged
with murder,'' she said.
   Patrolman William Lozano is free on $10,000 bond, charged with
two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of Lloyd, 23, and Allan
Blanchard, 24, his passenger who died of injuries in an ensuing
crash.
   Clement ``was shot in cold blood,'' she said, but prosecutors
have said the shooting did not meet legal thresholds for first- or
second-degree murder charges.
   A police union leader said at the meeting more black officers
should be patrolling the city's predominantly black neighborhoods.
   ``Black people in the community are demanding it,'' said Officer
Sam Harlan, president of the Miami Community Police Benevolent
Association.
   Eighteen percent of the officers in the Miami Police Department
are black. Anglos account for 39 percent and Hispanics 43 percent.
City officials say the composition of the force meets federal
affirmative action guidelines and reflects Miami's population.

   The U.S. government is talking about formally
improving communications with Angola and may establish and may
establish a small mission in Luanda, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said Friday.
   Redman stressed the office would lack diplomatic status and would
be limited to attempts to bring peace to southwestern africa.
   Redman was responding to reports that the two nations had started
talks about creating low-level missions in Washington and Luanda.
   ``We have discussed with them how such an improvement in
communication might be achieved, and we would expect these
discussions to continue,'' Redman said.
   ``However, there's been no change in our policy of
non-recognition, and no diplomatic relations with the Angolan
government; and there is no plan to change that policy,'' he noted.
   He was asked whether that would rule out ``interest sections,'' a
level of diplomatic relations below embassies.
   ``It would rule out anything at the so-called `diplomatic
level,''' said Redman. ``The kind of thing that you are referring to
is a possible idea, which has been that you might have a couple of
Americans on the ground to help monitor the implementation of the
peace accords.''
   Redman said American and Angolan authorities had ``for many
years, had bilateral contacts in the context of the southwestern
African peace process. Those contacts will continue, especially
within the framework of the Joint Commission, whose first session
took place in New York this week.''
   He was referring to the commission established in connection with
South African agreement to grant independence to Namibia, or
South-West Africa, in exchange for a Cuban troop withdrawal from
neighboring Angola.
   ``U.S. participation in the Joint Commission and our overall
interest in monitoring compliance by all parties with the New York
accords point to the need for improved communication between the
U.S. and the Angolan regime,'' Redman said.
   He said the United States is standing by its two conditions for
establishing diplomatic relations with leftist-controlled Angola _
Cuban troop withdrawal and national reconciliation. The latter
phrase is diplomatic shorthand for the U.S. position seeking a
settlement between the Angolan government and U.S.-backed UNITA
guerrillas.
   ``The authorities in Luanda obviously have it in their power to
address both these issues in ways that could lead to positive
evolution of relations with the United States,'' Redman said.
``Those are the essential factors that would affect the future
evolution of contacts between the U.S. and Luanda.''

<HEAD>NTSB Says Metal Fatigue Caused Piedmont Flight to Drop Engine After
Takeoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fatigued metal in a bolt cracked, causing an
engine to fall off a Piedmont Airlines jet minutes after takeoff
last week, federal investigators concluded Thursday.
   The fracture of a back bolt put the front two bolts under stress
and caused their eventual fracture, said James Kolstad, acting
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   His conclusion came in a letter to T. Allan McArtor,
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``There are several ways it (fatigue) could have happened,'' said
William Bruce, who is heading the NTSB investigation. ``What caused
the fatigue is what we're looking for.''
   Bruce said the investigation, which typically takes nine months,
is continuing.
   The right engine tore away from the Boeing 737 jet as Piedmont
Airlines Flight 1480 left O'Hare International Airport on Friday.
The engine fell in a field at the airport.
   The control tower told the pilot to return to O'Hare, but tapes
released this week showed the pilot never fully realized the problem
until the plane was back on the ground minutes later. None of the 27
passengers or six crew members were injured.
   The incident was the second of its kind involving a Boeing
737-200 series jet in the last 13 months.
   Last January, the government ordered airlines to inspect
engine-mount bolts on Boeing 737-200 series aircraft after an engine
fell off a USAir flight shortly after takeoff from Philadelphia.
   No one was hurt in that incident and the engine landed in an open
field.
   The Boeing 737-200 series jet has two engines, one mounted under
each wing and secured to the wing at the front by two bolts and at
the back by a single bolt.

<HEAD>Arafat Says PLO Has Asked Bush To `Turn Over New Leaf'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat said Friday the PLO has
contacted President Bush and asked him and his administration to
change U.S. policy in the Middle East.
   The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, at his
first meeting with representatives of the European Economic
Community, earlier met with three European foreign ministers and
discussed ways to promote an international peace conference on the
Middle East.
   Arafat has traveled to Stockholm, Vienna, Athens and Helsinki on
a campaign to portray the PLO as a moderate organization working
through diplomatic channels for the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
   He told a news conference the PLO made contact with Bush after
his Jan. 20 inauguration and that it asked his administration to
``turn over a new leaf'' on Middle East policy.
   The United States agreed in December to meet with the PLO after
Arafat recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
   Arafat, speaking in a mixture of Arabic and English with Spanish
translation, said the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau,
and a PLO representative in Tunis have had ``permanent contacts''
since their first meeting Dec. 16. He would not say how many
contacts they had or when the next meeting would take place.
   Arafat blamed former President Reagan's ational Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, declared an independent Palestinian state in
the Israeli-occupied lands.
   Arafat reportedly put out feelers on EEC recognition for the
state during the meeting with Fernandez Ordonez, French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas and Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias,
but did not make a formal request.
   Ordonez sidestepped the question of EEC recognition by saying it
was a matter for member states to decide individually.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Friday it was ``gravely
disappointed'' by the meeting. Israel has a policy of refusing to
negotiate with the PLO.
   Arafat was asked Friday what he thought about municipal elections
in the occupied territories. He replied: ``Isn't one experience
enough? Have you forgotten what happened the last time when some
were assassinated and some had their legs blown off?''
   He said the PLO would back internationally supervised elections
when Israel ends its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Since an uprising by Palestinians in the occupied territories
began 13 months ago, more than 360 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have
been killed.

   Defiantly declaring his innocence,
political cult leader Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. was sentenced to 15
years in prison Friday for scheming to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service and deliberately defaulting on more than $30 million in
loans from his supporters.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan also imposed lesser
prison terms and fines on six LaRouche aides who were convicted last
month on 35 counts of mail fraud and conspiracy for their roles in
the fund-raising effort.
   While Bryan was handing down the sentences in Alexandria,
government prosecutors dropped all charges in a related case against
LaRouche, six associates and five political organizations in U.S.
District Court in Boston.
   That case, involving charges that LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign had raised more than $2 million through credit card and
loan fraud, ended in a mistrial last May. A new trial had been
slated to begin Feb. 23.
   In a petition filed in the Boston court Friday, the U.S.
attorney's office said the criminal convictions against LaRouche and
others on Dec. 16 had served the government's interests ``from the
point of view of both deterrence and punishment,'' and that further
prosecution was not warranted.
   While about 60 followers sang, chanted and picketed outside the
Alexandria courthouse, LaRouche told Bryan in a presentencing appeal
that he was the victim of a government campaign to ``eliminate me
from the political scene.''
   But the judge scoffed at such claims by LaRouche, a three-time
fringe candidate for president, and the other defendants. ``I reject
that as arrant nonsense,'' Bryan said.
   Undaunted, LaRouche said ``the vital interests of the United
States have been put in jeopardy'' by his trial and conviction, and
that ``it is time for this evil and reckless prosecution to be
brought to a halt before further damage is done.''
   ``This is not a political case,'' retorted U.S. Attorney Kent
Robinson. ``This was a case of theft.''
   Robinson urged Bryan to impose a harsh sentence, or ``they just
might do it again.''
   LaRouche's 15-year term and no fine was substantially less than
the maximum possible penalty of 65 years in prison and fines
totaling $3.25 million for his conviction on 13 counts of tax and
mail fraud and conspiracy.
   LaRouche and the six others were convicted of fraudulently
soliciting more than $30 million in loans from supporters that they
had no intention of repaying.
   In addition, LaRouche was found guilty of conspiring to defraud
the IRS by having all his personal expenses paid by various
corporations he controlled and claiming he had no taxable income.
The government says LaRouche has not filed federal income tax
returns for any year since 1978.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said LaRouche will serve at
least five years before he is eligible for parole.
   All seven defendants sentenced Friday will appeal, said LaRouche
attorney Odin Anderson of Boston. He said LaRouche's ``many powerful
enemeies have had their day.''
   LaRouche is 66, and his lawyers said he suffers a degenerative
eye condition. LaRouche himself has predicted that he will be killed
by other inmates if he goes to prison.
   Bryan also sentenced William Wertz, fund-raising chief for
LaRouche, to five years' imprisonment and an $11,000 fine. Legal
coordinator Edward Spannaus, who complained of a ``20-year effort by
the FBI and the Department of Justice to crush our philosophical
association,'' received a five-year term and a $10,000 fine.
   Four LaRouche fund-raisers sentenced Friday were Michael
Billington and Dennis Small, who each were given three-year terms
and $8,000 fines, and Joyce Rubenstein and Paul Greenberg, each
sentenced to three years in prison and fined $6,000.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson called it ``a very satisfying
culmination to a very long journey.'' But he added, ``This will
never repay all those victims who have been swindled out of millions
of dollars over the years. I feel sorry for those people.''
   LaRouche had no visible reaction when Bryan imposed his sentence.
   Shortly after noon, he and the other defendants _ all wearing
handcuffs _ were led from the rear of the courthouse to a van which
took them to the Alexandria city jail for processing and assignment
to a federal prison.
   LaRouche did not speak to reporters, but smiled and waved to a
small knot of supporters from a grilled window of the van as it sped
away.
   LaRouche spokeswoman Dana Scanlon said demonstrators were
mounting a round-the-clock vigil in Lafayette Park with a large,
lighted sign reading ``Pardon LaRouche,'' visible at the White House
across the street.
   In Mexico City on Friday, about a dozen LaRouche supporters held
a protest march in front of the Monument of Independence, also known
as the angel. They carried signs that read ``LaRouche is Innocent.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government is talking about formally
improving communications with Angola and may establish a small
mission in Luanda, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Friday.
   Redman stressed the office would lack diplomatic status and would
be limited to attempts to bring peace to southwestern africa.
   Redman was responding to reports that the two nations had started
talks about creating low-level missions in Washington and Luanda.
   ``We have discussed with them how such an improvement in
communication might be achieved, and we would expect these
discussions to continue,'' Redman said.
   ``However, there's been no change in our policy of
non-recognition, and no diplomatic relations with the Angolan
government; and there is no plan to change that policy,'' he noted.
   He was asked whether that would rule out ``interest sections,'' a
level of diplomatic relations below embassies.
   ``It would rule out anything at the so-called `diplomatic
level,''' said Redman. ``The kind of thing that you are referring to
is a possible idea, which has been that you might have a couple of
Americans on the ground to help monitor the implementation of the
peace accords.''
   Redman said American and Angolan authorities had ``for many
years, had bilateral contacts in the context of the southwestern
African peace process. Those contacts will continue, especially
within the framework of the Joint Commission, whose first session
took place in New York this week.''
   He was referring to the commission established in connection with
South African agreement to grant independence to Namibia, or
South-West Africa, in exchange for a Cuban troop withdrawal from
neighboring Angola.
   ``U.S. participation in the Joint Commission and our overall
interest in monitoring compliance by all parties with the New York
accords point to the need for improved communication between the
U.S. and the Angolan regime,'' Redman said.
   He said the United States is standing by its two conditions for
establishing diplomatic relations with leftist-controlled Angola _
Cuban troop withdrawal and national reconciliation. The latter
phrase is diplomatic shorthand for the U.S. position seeking a
settlement between the Angolan government and U.S.-backed UNITA
guerrillas.
   ``The authorities in Luanda obviously have it in their power to
address both these issues in ways that could lead to positive
evolution of relations with the United States,'' Redman said.
``Those are the essential factors that would affect the future
evolution of contacts between the U.S. and Luanda.''

   Look to your pawns and pieces, human: The
30th-ranked chess player in the United States is a machine.
   Deep Thought, a computer put together by graduate students ``as a
hobby kind of thing,'' came out of nowhere to beat Hitech, the
world's top-rated chess-playing program at a computer chess
tournament in November.
   ``Certainly a year ago, no one thought this was possible,'' Vince
McCambridge, an international master and spokesman for the U.S.
Chess Federation, said Friday.
   ``It brings the specter of a computer world chess champion by the
end of the century closer to reality,'' said McCambridge, who has
played Deep Thought to a draw.
   Hitech, the erstwhile champion, was one of many formidable
opponents Deep Thought beat at the Association of Computing
Machinery Tournament in Orlando, Fla., winning its ranking as the
30th best chess player, human or mechanical, in the United States.
   Until that November tournament, Hitech, built by Carnegie Mellon
University Professor Hans Berliner, had been the game's best
electronic player.
   Deep Thought, built by five Carnegie Mellon graduate students,
lacks the chess knowledge that Berliner programmed into Hitech, but
more than compensates by being almost six times faster at sorting
through the myriad possibilities for moving pieces on the board.
   Its speed allows it to look more moves ahead in the game.
   Berliner was out of town and could not be reached for comment, a
university spokeswoman said.
   By achieving a rating of 2,551 under the U.S. Chess Federation
system, Deep Thought also won the Fredkin Intermediate Prize for
becoming the first machine to surpass the 2500 barrier. Hitech ranks
just above 2,400; world champion Gary Kasparov of the Soviet Union,
by comparison, ranks above 2,800.
   The $10,000 prize money, to be awarded in Detroit in August, will
be shared among Deep Thought's five creators, led by computer
science student Feng-Hsiung Hsu.
   Hsu, who designed the silicon guts of the computer, said he
intends to replace the two microprocessors that power it with eight
microprocessors to make Deep Thought even faster. The machine can
now analyze 700,000 board positions per second, compared to 120,000
for Hitech, Hsu said.
   Now that the students have won the second of three prizes to be
offered by by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Edward
Fredkin, Hsu has not ruled out a shot at the one remaining _
$100,000 to the first machine to beat the reigning international
champion.
   The first Fredkin prize, $5,000, went to two Bell Labs scientists
in 1981 for creating the first computer to achieve the status of
chess master.
   Deep Thought is all the more impressive because the five students
lacked the financial backing of other artificial intelligence
research programs, McCambridge said.
   ``There are a number of other programs, at Bell Labs, Los Alamos
Labs and the Hitech project, which are backed by enormous research
money,'' he said. ``The Deep Thought project was really done as a
hobby kind of thing by a few guys.''
   Deep Thought received $5,000 from the Defense Department, said
team member Thomas Anatharaman. The five students, who also include
Michael Browne, Murray Campbell and Andreas Nowatzyk, scraped
together donated funds to travel to chess tournaments, he said.
   Hitech, in contrast, got at least $20,000 for components, said
CMU spokeswoman Anne Watzman.
   Of the five Deep Thought creators, Campbell is the best chess
player, holding expert status, ``which is not strong at all,'' said
Browne.
   ``And the person who programmed it has difficulty keeping his
moves on the board. So Deep Thought was purely an engineering
approach,'' Browne said.
   At the Software Toolworks Open in Long Beach, Calif., in
November, the machine beat international masters Jeremy Silman and
Alex Fishbein and played McCambridge to a draw.
   Its only defeat came against Walter Browne, who holds the World
Chess Federation's highest rank, grandmaster, and is a six-time U.S.
Chess Federation champion.
   ``It was the most impressive achievement ever'' for a computer,
said McCambridge, who for a time had an advantage in his game with
Deep Thought.
   ``I relaxed when I was winning,'' he said. ``It never gets tired
and it never gives up.''

<HEAD>Yusupov-Spraggett Match Tied At 2.5 Each</HEAD>

<DATELINE>QUEBEC (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fifth game of the World Chess Championship
Candidates quarterfinal between Artur Yusupov of the Soviet Union
and Canadian Grandmaster Kevin Spraggett ended in a 32-move draw
Friday.
   The score stands tied at 2.5-2.5 with only one game remaining.
   Yusupov, playing white against a Queens Indian defense, gained a
small spatial advantage from the opening, but failed to penetrate
Spraggett's rock-solid defenses.
   Canadian experts, bouyed by their man's return to form after a
loss and a lackluster draw in the third and fourth games, said
Spraggett has chances to defeat the 28-year-old prematch favorite
and become the first North American since Bobby Fischer to reach the
semifinal stage.
   ``It may be in the sixth game, it may be in the playoff, but
either way I think Spraggett is going to win,'' said Brian
Nickoloff, a Canadian international master.
   The winner of the candidates, a series of knockout matches, will
challenge world champion Garri Kasparov for his world title in 1990.
   If the sixth game, scheduled for Sunday with Spraggett playing
with the advantage of white, is drawn, two further games on Tuesday
and Thursday will be played, followed by sudden death tiebreakers at
increasingly high speeds.
   Spraggett, a 34-year-old from Montreal who is ranked only 35th in
the world, rose to prominence in the previous stage, when he knocked
out Soviet Grandmaster Andrei Sokolov in a hair-raising time
scramble in which each player was allowed only 15 minutes thinking
time for the whole game.
   British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman is the only player so far
through to the semifinals.
   If the Spraggett-Yusupov match goes into extra time, all three
undecided contests will be in progress around the globe
simultaneously.
   The first game in the quarterfinal duel between former world
champion Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union, who is strongly
favored, and Icelandic Grandmaster Johann Hjartarson is scheduled
for Saturday in Seattle.
   In the fourth quarterfinal, Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman will
face off against Lajos Portisch of Hungary beginning Wednesday.

<HEAD>`China's First Sex Movie' Disappoints Audiences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of what was billed in advance as
``China's first sex movie'' says the censors' knife has taken out
all the sex scenes, and viewers said Friday they are not pleased.
   ``It was boring,'' one viewer said after watching ``Widows'
Village,'' a 90-minute tale of love constricted by unusual marriage
taboos in a fishing village in the 1940s.
   Following what they believe to be their ancestors' commands, the
villagers bar married couples from making love for three years, and
then only three times a year until they have a child.
   The official China News Service said last month on the movie's
opening day in the southern city of Canton that ``Widows' Village''
contained ``special scenes showing couples' lovemaking'' and that it
was being called ``China's first sex movie.'' It quoted the
director, Wang Jin, as saying he hoped theaters would bar children.
   When the movie reached Beijing a week ago, the advance publicity
drew sell-out audiences. Ticket scalpers outside the Capital Theater
helped hype it. ``It's got naked people,'' one leered.
   Not true. The most daring scene shows a married couple from the
head up, panting as they lie in bed after having made love.
   ``We can see more than that in videos,'' a well-dressed young
woman said after viewing the movie. The acting and story-line got
``just so-so'' ratings from other viewers.
   Wang said in a telephone interview from the Pearl River Movie
Studio in Canton that some scenes showing sex were cut before the
movie was released for mainland use. He said the scenes would be
left in when it opens in nearby Hong Kong.
   The Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, which censors all
movies, denied knowledge of any cuts and suggested Wang may have
hyped his movie to attract crowds.
   The 47-year-old director, who won one of China's top awards for a
movie in 1986, said it wasn't hype.
   ``I still think the film is improper for children,'' he said.
``China is preparing to set up a system of classifying movies. ...
And I want my movie to be the first to be declared unsuitable for
children.''

<HEAD>Pacific Fleet Commander Charges Soviets Breaking Gorbachev Pledge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has broken Mikhail Gorbachev's
pledge not to increase the number of nuclear weapons in the Pacific,
and there are more spy ships in the Hawaii area, says the commander
of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   Adm. David Jeremiah said the Soviets in recent months have added
a new attack submarine to their Pacific fleet, in contradiction to a
speech Gorbachev made last September.
   He quoted the Soviet leader as saying the Soviet Union would not
increase the number of any type of nuclear weapons in the Pacific
region.
   ``Aware of the Asian and Pacific countries' concern, the Soviet
Union will not increase the amount of any nuclear weapons in the
region _ it has already been practicing this for some time _ and is
calling on the United States and other nuclear powers not to deploy
them additionally in the region,'' Gorbachev said in the speech at
Krasnoyarsk, according to the Tass summary.
   The new submarine raised the total of Soviet Delta-class
strategic subs in the Pacific to 17, Jeremiah said in a speech
Thursday during a change-of-command ceremony at Pearl Harbor.
   ``While those of us in senior military positions welcome this new
era of openness with the Kremlin, we remain concerned about the
disparity between what we hear from the Soviets and what we actually
see in the fleet,'' he said.
   He did not say how he knew of the new sub's presence.
   The number of far-ranging deployments by Soviet warships has
decreased since 1985, he said, but the Soviets have increased the
presence of spy ships in Hawaiian waters.
   ``The presence of Soviet intelligence-collection ships in the
near vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands has grown from 60 days in 1986
to more than 250 days in 1987 and 1988,'' Jeremiah said.
   The change-of-command ceremony was for Vice Adm. James Dorsey
Jr., who assumed command of the 3rd Fleet.

   A lobbyist for bingo and racing interests
has pleaded guilty to bribing a state legislator and related
charges, the first convictions in a 3-year-old investigation of
gambling-related industries.
   W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, formerly the state's chief bingo
regulator, pleaded guilty Thursday in state court to bribing state
Sen. Randy McNally to pass a bingo-related bill and attempting to
bribe him to vote for another bill legalizing betting on horse races.
   Walker also pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy, extortion, and
tax charges.
   Under a plea bargain, in return for his cooperation with the
investigation and his guilty pleas Walker would face a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison and an unspecified fine. He faced up
to 28 years and a $600,000 fine.
   Walker was the first person to be found guilty in the
federal-state investigation dubbed ``Rocky Top,'' after a popular
Tennessee song. It began in 1986 with reports that bingo operators
were paying state officials to ignore violations of laws regulating
the industry.
   ``It is a large-scale investigation,'' said U.S. Attorney John
Gill of Chattanooga. ``We do expect a significant number of
indictments and it's certainly possible that the investigation may
go into 1990.''
   Prosecutors said they are are looking into allegations that other
legislators, besides the one state senator, were bribed but wouldn't
give details.
   In his state pleas, Walker admitted twice offering bribes to
state Sen. McNally, who reported the offers to the Tennessee Bureau
of Investigation and was not charged.
   In the attempted bribery case, Walker admitted offering McNally
$10,000 to vote for a bill to legalize pari-mutuel betting on horse
racing when it moved to the Senate floor in April 1987. The bill
eventually passed by one vote; McNally voted against it and was not
paid.
   McNally said Walker occasionally boasted of payoffs he had made
to other legislators. But McNally declined to identify those named
by Walker and said he had no other evidence other payoffs were made.
   Walker faces up to 10 years on the state bribery charges.
   He also pleaded guilty Thursday in Chattanooga to filing a false
1985 federal income tax return that omitted payoffs from bingo
operators, and to a conspiracy count that charged he knew of
widespread illegal gambling operations.
   Also Thursday, Walker pleaded guilty to an extortion charge in
another federal court, in Nashville. He was accused of accepting
$15,000 from bingo operators in 1985, when he was chief bingo
regulator in the secretary of state's office.
   Bingo is exempt from state gambling law when operated for
charity. But The Tennessean newspaper, which has investigated the
industry, reported that only $2.6 million of the $124.7 million
raised by bingo operators in 1985-87 could be traced as having gone
to charity.
   No specific sentencing date was set in the Chattanooga court, but
in Nashville, U.S. District Court Judge John Nixon set sentencing on
that count for April 4. He said the hearing would probably be
postponed to allow Walker to testify before grand juries.
   The probe includes the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the
Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.

<HEAD>Trump, Palm Beachers Threaten To Sue Noisy Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization founded by
millionaires Donald Trump and George Petty has announced it will sue
the county in 30 days unless it acts to lessen the noise from Palm
Beach International Airport.
   Jets from the airport pass over posh Palm Beach and many West
Palm Beach neighborhoods at low altitudes, causing a deafening roar
that residents say makes it impossible to carry on a conversation.
   In an open-air news conference interrupted periodically by jets
screaming toward the east, members of the Good Neighbor Council for
Aircraft Noise Control said Thursday that they had taken their first
legal steps to try to force Palm Beach County and the airport to
quiet down.
   They also advocate banning Stage 2 aircraft _ noisy, older planes
such as DC-9s and Boeing 727s.
   Trump's own private plane, a Boeing 727, might be banned from the
airport should the guidelines proposed by the anti-noise groups be
enacted.
   ``If that means Mr. Trump has to get a new airplane, he'll bloody
well have to get a new airplane,'' said Petty, a Canadian-born pulp
and paper executive who lives a few houses away from Trump's
Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.
   Airport spokesman Jerry Allen said about 65 percent of the
aircraft using the airport are of the quieter ``Stage 3'' type, such
as Boeing 757s _ up from 25 percent in 1982.
   At the anti-noise news conference, however, such arguments would
have fallen on deaf ears of the residents, many of whom wore
T-shirts emblazoned with the command, ``Shhhhhh!''

<HEAD>Stocks Rise Sharply, Capping Biggest Week Of Recent Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices jumped higher in heavy trading
Friday to cap the biggest week yet in Wall Street's 2-month-old
rally, which has pushed the market back to levels it held just
before the Black Monday crash.
   Analysts said investors continued scrambling to join the
unexpectedly sharp and durable rally, amid renewed optimism about
weak inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.79 to
2,322.86, bringing its gain for the week to 87.50 points.
   Broader market indicators also moved higher and trading volume
was the heaviest in seven months. On the New York Stock Exchange,
254.87 million shares changed hands, the busiest session since a
264.41 million-share day last June 27.
   Before the stock market opened, the Commerce Department estimated
U.S. gross national product grew at an inflation-adjusted annual
rate of 2 percent in fourth quarter 1988.
   The figure was slower than most advance estimates on Wall Street,
and provided fresh evidence that the economy was slowing to a
sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace, analysts said.
   Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term
government bonds _ thereby pushing down interest rates _ which gave
fresh momentum to the rally in stocks.

<HEAD>Dozens of Guns Turned in as Campaign Against Weapons Builds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40 semiautomatic assault rifles,
including 13 from one woman, have been turned over to police in a
cash-for-rifles campaign in the aftermath of the Stockton school
massacre, officials said Friday.
   The woman who bought the 13 AK-47 rifles ``did it to get them off
the shelves,'' said City Councilman Nate Holden, whose idea started
the campaign.
   The woman, who was not identified, was reimbursed the $5,191.80
she spent, Holden said, adding that he would honor her at a City
Council meeting. ``She just wanted to recover her costs,'' Holden
said. ``Can you believe it?''
   The department's official gun count stood at 42, but Holden
estimated ``upwards of 50'' and a radio station that took up the
cause put the number at 59.
   ``It's just rolling right along,'' Holden said, describing a
steady flow of people coming to his office with police receipts to
claim money from a $50,000 political committee fund the mayoral
candidate set aside Tuesday.
   Five people who collected We do not want to profiteer or benefit from
their tragedy,''
said Jeffrey Fox, spokesman for five Van Nuys real estate office
workers.
   Almost all the guns turned in have been AK-47s, said Lt. Fred
Nixon, a Police Department spokesman. The first gun turned in
Tuesday was an Uzi.
   Holden, who will pay the value of the weapon up to $300, said
most people will get the maximum but does not believe profit will
become a motive.
   ``They have a bad feeling about what happened at Stockton,''
Holden said.
   Patrick Purdy, a young drifter, used an AK-47 on Jan. 17 to kill
five students and wound 29 others and one teacher at Cleveland
Elementary School in Stockton, a San Joaquin Valley community,
before he shot himself to death.
   It was possible to make a profit from the campaigns. People also
could pick up $300 by taking a copy of the police receipt to radio
station KIIS-FM in Hollywood from Thursday morning through Friday
morning.
   The radio station reimbursed the woman who bought the 13 rifles
$300 per rifle. Holden then paid her the remainder, or $1,291.80.
   The station would verify all the receipts before issuing checks
but was concerned only with getting the weapons off the street and
not whether anyone made any money, said Lynn Anderson-Powell,
president and general manager.
   ``Our purpose was to decrease the number of guns on the street.
... We feel that's that many fewer lives that may be needlessly
taken in violence,'' she said.
   The station offered $1,000 to the first person to take advantage
of the offer and the result was a three-way tie, and because one
person gave up two guns, KIIS awarded $4,000, Ms. Anderson-Powell
said.
   Compton gun shop owner Mike Virgilio said he sells the AK-47 for
$309.95 but has seen custom versions worth up to $1,500. Last year
the regular model sold for $250 and a used one could cost just $200,
he said.
   A semiautomatic Uzi retails for $649, Virgilio said.
   The Los Angeles Police Department has supported the campaign
against the military-style semiautomatic rifles favored by street
gangs and helped publicize procedures for safely bringing the
weapons to its stations.
   Police are examining all the guns to determine whether any have
been involved in crimes. All guns not retained as evidence will be
destroyed.

   Maine Gov. John R. McKernan and Rep.
Olympia Snowe announced Friday their plans to be married Feb. 24,
according to a statement issued by the governor's office.
   A spokesman for the governor said his staff did not learn of the
news until mid-afternoon. ``I almost fell over, but I wasn't
surprised,'' said press secretary Willis Lyford.
   Lyford said the couple plan to have a church wedding in Lewiston,
but that none of the details have been firmed up.
   Neither McKernan nor Snowe could be reached immediately; both
were out of their offices during the afternoon.
   McKernan and Snowe, both Republicans, served together in the U.S.
House of Representatives from 1983 to 1986 and in the Maine House of
Representatives during the 1970s, and have dated for several years.
They plan to continue separate political careers, the governor's
office said.
   McKernan, 40, took office as chief executive in January 1987,
becoming Maine's first Republican governor in two decades, after two
terms in Congress.
   McKernan is divorced and the father of a teen-age son.
   Snowe, 41, entered the U.S. House in 1979 and was elected last
year to her sixth term. She was widowed in 1973.

   Twenty-eight federal prosecutors in Massachusetts
urged the resignation or removal of their boss, the embattled U.S.
Attorney Frank L. McNamara Jr., in a letter Friday to U.S. Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh.
   The letter's signers are among the 39 assistant U.S. attorneys in
the Boston and Springfield offices under McNamara's command.
   McNamara, 41, a Republican appointed by President Reagan in 1987,
has been under fire since November, when the Justice Department
reported that his allegations that he saw his predecessor, William
F. Weld, smoke marijuana at a party, could not be substantiated.
   ``Mr. McNamara's conduct and performance while United States
Attorney is resulting in a loss of confidence in the administration
of justice on the part of the courts, the bar, law enforcement
agencies and the public,'' the letter said.
   McNamamara did not return telephone calls to his office.
   ``Because Mr. McNamara will neither resign nor step aside
temporarily, the credibility and operations of this office will
continue to be damaged, perhaps irretrievably, unless he is
removed,'' the letter said.
   McNamara reportedly has been the subject of several federal
probes.
   Citing anonymous sources, The Boston Globe reported Friday that
the Justice Department is interested in whether any relationship
between McNamara and Senate President William Bulger may have
affected a probe into real estate development in Boston.
   The Boston Herald, also citing an unidentified source, said
McNamara's staff did not tell him about the case because they were
afraid he would use it to embarrass Gov. Michael S. Dukakis during
his Democratic presidential campaign.
   On Thursday, the Globe reported that assessments by two federal
agencies of McNamara's performance have led Thornburgh to conclude
McNamara should resign.
   Dukakis said Friday, ``The situation has been an embarrassment
for months and months and months. I don't think this appointment
should ever have been made.'' A day earlier Dukakis said flatly, ``I
think he should be fired.''
   Dukakis himself has been a target of McNamara.
   According to published reports, McNamara pressed an investigation
into potential conflict of interest in the state's purchase of land
in New Braintree for a state prison.
   McNamara allegedly continued pushing the investigation even after
his staff told him there was no evidence to support allegations of
conflict of interest.
   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said if no action is forthcoming from the
Justice Department, ``then I think (congressional) hearings will be
necessary.''

   A low pressure system over southwest New Mexico spread snow, rain
and drizzle and thunderstorms across New Mexico on Friday, and
Alaska's cold snap continued with record lows and wind chills down
to 100 degrees below zero.
   Snow showers swung from the Great Lakes into northern New
England, but fair weather and seasonally mild temperatures prevailed
from the northern and central Plains to the mid-Atlantic states.
   In New Mexico, up to 6 inches of new snow was measured Friday at
Los Alamos, with additional accumulations up to 4 inches expected.
Showers and a few thunderstorms spread across west-central and
southern Texas.
   Snowshowers ranged across New York into Vermont.
   Very cold air continued to dominate much of central and northern
Alaska. For the eighth day, Fairbanks stayed colder than 40 degrees
below zero and three places set all-time record low temperatures
overnight.
   McGrath reported minus 74 degrees, breaking the old mark by 10
degrees; Tanana fell to minus 76 degrees and Galena had a low of 68
degrees below zero, while 10 to 15 mph winds put winds chills colder
than 100 degres below zero.
   The low in the nation Friday morning was 27 degrees below zero at
Gunnison, Colo. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged
from zero at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 80 degrees at Miami and Fort
Myers, Fla.
   In the national forecast for Saturday, rain and thunderstorms
will be likely across the central and southern Plains into the
middle Mississippi Valley. Showers will be scattered from central
and southeast Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley, and across
central and northern Illinois.
   Snow will be widespread from northwest Kansas and southwest
Nebraska into the eastern half of Colorado and northeast New Mexico.
Rain will change to snow across southwest Kansas and the western
Oklahoma Panhandle.
   High temperatures will be in the 30s and 40s across much of the
nation west of the Mississippi River and in the 50s and 60s east of
the Mississippi River; in the teens and 20s over southern Idaho and
northeast Nevada, and across northern Maine; in the 30s from the
northern Plains through the northern Great Lakes into southern New
England; in the 40s from the lower Great Lakes to the northern half
of the mid-Atlantic Coast; in the 50s and 60s from northern and
central California through the southern Rockies, and much of Texas
into the lower Mississippi Valley; in the 70s over the Los Angeles
basin, and from the central Gulf Coast through much of Florida.

<TEXT>
   The Panamanian government Friday
denied a report that strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega founded a
bank to strengthen military control over the economy and launder
drug money.
   A press release from the National Banking Commission said a story
in Thursday's Washington Post was ``a new disinformation and
destablization attempt _ with political ends _ against the
Panamanian finance system, discrediting ... Noreiga, the Defense
Forces and the country.''
   The Post quoted U.S. and Panamanian sources as saying the Banco
Institucional Patria opened on Jan. 16 in a move to expand military
control and to ``corner the market on money-laundering.''
   Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces, has been Panama's de facto
ruler since February, when the National Assembly ousted President
Eric Arturo Delvalle. Delvalle had tried to fire Noriega, who was
indicted on drug trafficking charges by a federal court in Florida.
   The Banking Comission said it gave the Defense Forces control
over the bank in December 1987.
   ``There is nothing abnormal nor strange is this type of military
banking institution,'' the statement said. It said the bank is made
up of 120 individual banks.
   Bank vice president Col. Angel Mina told journalists on Friday,
``The newspaper story is false, and whoever gave this version is a
ex-official of the Department of State who is trying to gain points
with false information and ingratiate himself with President Bush.''
   Mina said that the bank has operated for 35 years with the
savings of military personnel and now has about $21 million in
capital.

   The U.S. government said on Friday the Soviet
Union could play in role in ending the rebellion in the southern
Sudan.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the Soviets were
involved because of their connections to the government of
neighboring Ethiopia.
   He declined to elaborate, but the Sudanese government has charged
repeatedly that Ethiopia provides arms and money to the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army, which is fighting Sudanese forces. Some
350,000 refugees from the fighting have fled to Ethiopia.
   ``We have, ourselves, been encouraging both Khartoum and the SPLA
to end the war, and we've offered our good offices in this effort,''
said Redman. ``We're willing to play any appropriate role in pursuit
of peace acceptable to both sides. The Soviets also have an
important potential role to play in light of their position in
Ethiopia.''
   The Soviets have been supporting the Ethiopian government against
insurgents in Eritrea and Tigray.
   Redman noted that American and Soviet officials have discussed
the Horn of Africa on several occasions over the past year.
   ``We urged the Soviets to consider seriously their
responsibilities to promote solutions to the humanitarian crises in
the Horn,'' Redman said. ``I think that basically captures it.''

   A powerful earthquake, rated at 6.3 on the
Richter scale, shook the remote Komandorsky Islands west of Alaska
on Friday, the National Earthquake Information Center reported.
   The quake, which struck at 12:35 a.m. PST, was centered in the
the islands at the end of the Aleutian chain, which extends more
than 900 miles from the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula, separating the
Bering Sea from the Pacific Ocean.
   The center said there were no reports of damage because so few
people live in the area.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. For every
increase of one number _ from 5.5 to 6.5 for example _ the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   Readings of 8.9, the highest on record, were computed from
seismographic records of a quake off the coast of Ecuador in 1906
and from a quake off the coast of Japan in 1933.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which happened before the
Richter scale was in use, was computed at 8.3. The quake and
subsequent fire were blamed for 700 deaths.

   A flagman who waved a pickup truck and a
car into the path of an oncoming train at a crossing, killing one
man and injuring three people, could face criminal charges,
authorities said Friday.
   The Union Pacific flagman, whose name was not released,
apparently was unaware Thursday morning that the train was coming
because of noise from nearby heavy machinery, said investigators
from the Harris County sheriff's office.
   ``Now, it's in the hands of the district attorney,'' sheriff's
deputy John Elzey said Friday night. ``The DA will decide whether to
file any charges in the case. They'll review the paperwork and the
pictures.''
   The pickup truck driver killed in the accident was identified as
Henry Neal White, of Humble, Texas. His wife, Sara, and their
3-year-old grandson, Matthew White, were thrown from the truck.
   Mrs. White was listed in serious condition and the child was
listed in critical condition Friday, authorities said. A woman
driving the car behind the Whites' vehicle was seriously injured,
authorities said.
   The crossing's warning arms and flashing lights apparently were
activated by the heavy equipment of a railroad crew working at the
site, and the flagman was there to wave traffic through, Union
Pacific spokesman John Bromley said.
   Bromley said the train sounded its whistle before reaching the
crossing, where it struck the rear of the truck and the front of the
car simultaneously.
   The railroad is interviewing all of its employees who were
working at the crossing, Bromley said, and could take disciplinary
action.

<TEXT>
   Dutch legislators Friday pardoned
two Nazi war criminals, one of whom may have sent Anne Frank to the
death camp, and let them go home to their families in West Germany.
   Franz Fischer and Ferdinand aus der Fuenten were released after
43 years in prison for their parts in the Holocaust deaths of more
than 10,000 Dutch Jews.
   The Parliament vote to free Fischer, 87, and aus der Fuenten, 79,
ended two days of emotional debate. Opponents of the pardon said
they should have stayed in jail for the rest of their lives.
   Fischer headed a local branch of the Nazi Security Service and
was held responsible for the deporting 13,000 Jews to death camps.
Aus der Fuenten was an SS administrator who oversaw mass roundups of
Jews in the Netherlands.
   ``We saw this coming, but still it hit us very hard,'' said
prominent Rabbi Avraham Soetendorp.
   He said aus der Fuenten ``may have been indirectly responsible''
for sending Anne Frank to a concentration camp. The girl and her
family lived in an Amsterdam attic for two years before they were
discovered and sent to concentration camps.
   Her poignant work, ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' perhaps the most
famous personal document to come out of the Holocaust, was published
in 1947 and was turned into a play and movie. She died of pneumonia
in 1945 at age 15 in Germany's Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
   Fischer and aus der Fuenten were expelled from the Netherlands
and handed over to West German authorities hours after Parliament
approved the pardon, according to the Justice Ministry.
   Witnesses outside the prison in southern Breda city, where they
were held, saw an ambulance and unmarked prison wagon drive away
under police escort.
   West Germany's ARD television network said the two arrived in the
country late Friday. The TV showed two frail-looking, gray-haired
men step from an ambulance.
   Dutch newspapers have reported that relatives of the two men said
they were planning to spend their old age quietly with their
families.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker praised the
decision to pardon the men, calling it a humanitarian act. A
government spokesman said they would be allowed to settle in West
Germany.
   ``They are German and they have the right as Germans to enter the
country,'' said government spokesman Ulrich Strempel.
   Aus der Fuenten's wife, Maria, lives in an apartment in a gray
building in a working-class neighborhood in Duisburg, about 36 miles
from the Dutch border. Ute Dehnen, who lives across the street, told
The Associated Press: ``I've never spoken to her as a matter of
principle. I would have divorced that man and I can't understand why
any woman wouldn't.''
   Her husband, Werner, said: ``I can't help but think of the
victims' families and the pain this man caused.''
   The Dutch Parliament approved the government decision by voting
against a Labor opposition motion to keep the two jailed. The vote
was 85-55.
   Inneke Haas Berger, a center-left member of Parliament and
leading opponent of the release, said: ``Time hasn't made things
easier. It's just made the pain greater.''
   But Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes told lawmakers: ``Let's
rid our society of the miserable remainder of the two war criminals'
lives.''
   They had become ``symbols (of Nazi evil) and an unending source
of sorrow and strife'' to victims of the war, he said.
   Outside Parliament, several demonstrators waved placards, one
demanding, ``Don't make the victims suffer further! Never release
the henchmen!''
   Only 6,000 of the 150,000 Jews who lived in Holland before the
war survived the Nazi death camps.
   Fischer headed a local branch of the Nazi Security Service and
was held responsible for the deportating 13,000 Jews to death camps.
Aus der Fuenten was an SS administrator who oversaw mass roundups of
Jews in the Netherlands.
   Fischer and aus der Fuenten were sentenced to death in 1950.
Their sentences later were commuted to life imprisonment.
   ``It would have been better in cases like these if the death
penalty ... had ultimately been executed,'' said Korhals Altes.
   Premier Ruud Lubbers told reporters that the decision followed
months of secret talks with former resistance figures and Holocaust
survivors.
   Most argued for their release, Lubbers said.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, head of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal
Center, wrote in a letter to Lubbers, `It is unconscionable to
release such notorious individuals, who perpetrated heinous crimes
and caused suffering to so many thousands.''
   The center is devoted to the search for Nazi war criminals. It is
named after the famed Nazi hunter.

   The government reacted with surprise to a U.S.
announcement that the main purpose of a planned four-mile ditch
along the border will be to deter drug smugglers and illegal
immigrants, saying it was told the ditch was for drainage problems.
   In a statement Thursday, Foreign Ministry officials acknowledged
they knew about plans for the 5-foot-deep, 14-foot-wide ditch along
the San Diego-Tijuana border. But they said they had been told it
was to solve rainwater drainage problems on the flat Otay Mesa,
along the international border.
   ``The Mexican government was not told that the purpose of this
construction could be to control migration, or anything else of that
nature,'' the statement said.
   Several Mexican congressmen reacted angrily to the proposal,
calling it ``unfriendly'' and saying it would not stop the flow of
illegal immigrants.

   House negotiators have reached a tentative
agreement that would require members to give up much more than their
speaking fees in return for a 50 percent pay raise, according to
bipartisan sources.
   Senate leaders were not far behind in negotiating a contingency
plan to restrict outside income should the raise become law, as
expected, on Feb. 8, a Senate source said Thursday.
   Both houses are expected to move hastily to restrict non-salary
income once the raise kicks in, to minimize the political damage and
avoid the embarrassment of members earning considerable outside
income in addition to their new salary of $135,000.

   Many buildings in earthquake-prone areas
should be constructed atop rubber shock absorbers to protect office
contents such as computers as well as human lives, experts are
telling major U.S. corporations.
   ``It's not adequate anymore to just think about stopping building
collapse,'' says Robert J. Kuntz, president of the California
Engineering Foundation, a nonprofit education group that sponsored a
two-day conference to make engineers aware of the shock absorbers.
   ``You've got to protect the hundreds of millions of dollars of
equipment inside these buildings and allow the enterprise to remain
functional,'' he said. ``This goes beyond protecting life and limb.''
   Kuntz and others urged companies in quake-prone areas nationwide
to consider building new low- and medium-rise buildings _ and even
refurbishing old ones _ using ``seismic base isolation,'' which
involves placing large, flexible shock absorbers between a building
and its foundation.

   The latest brutal wave of school shootings is
reviving concern about schoolyard security and debate over whether
it's possible to protect students from disturbed adults or fellow
youngsters with easy access to weapons.
   ``You would have to build a 10-foot brick wall around all the
elementary schools in the United States and they'd have to have
barbed wire to prevent people from going up the brick wall and over
the brick wall. You'd have to have roving guards and armed police at
all times,'' said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of the
National School Boards Association.
   ``The real problem is not school security. The real problem is
the availability of weaponry.''
   The nation was jolted last week by the killing of five Stockton,
Calif., elementary school students by a man wielding a
semi-automatic assault rifle. The latest incident of schoolyard
violence occurred Thursday at Wilson High School in Washington,
D.C., where four students were shot by a young man near the school
building. None of the wounds was fatal.

<HEAD>Satirical Sex-and-Politics Shows Pack Athens Theaters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DINA KYRIAKIDOU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greeks are packing theaters to laugh at
satirical shows that mock Premier Andreas Papandreou for flaunting
his love affair with Dimitra Liani, a former airline stewardess.
   Politics and sex have been favorite topics for Greek comedians
ever since the playwright Aristophanes made the combination a smash
hit in the 5th century B.C.
   This year the scriptwriters didn't need much imagination.
   While the 69-year-old socialist premier carries on a public
relationship with his 34-year-old blond girlfriend, his ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) is rocked by a string of
multimillion-dollar financial scandals.
   Papandreou's heart operation in London last September inspired
the title of a sellout revue, ``Post-Aorta Greece,'' written and
directed by Lakis Lazopoulos, Greece's top satirist.
   Lazopoulos asks innocently: ``If a newcomer to Athens saw Andreas
and Dimitra walking and holding hands, what would he think?
   ``That there's a nice girl helping an old man cross the street,''
comes the answer, as the audience roars.
   Outside the Vembo Theater a giant poster of Papandreou and Liani
embracing advertises ``Little Dimitra's Sweetheart,'' a take-off of
a classic Greek folklore play, ``The Little Shepherdess'
Sweetheart.''
   In the show, an Athenian houswife is asked whether the premier's
pre-election pledges of political and social change have been
fulfilled.
   ``Andreas has made one change OK. He changed his American woman
for a Greek,'' she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic
applause.
   Three months ago, Papandreou said he will divorce his 66-year-old
Amercan-born wife, Margaret, but no proceedings have yet been
started. Liani has been twice divorced.
   Six political revues recently played in Athens. According to
box-office figures, they grossed up to $37,500 a week, twice as much
as the most successful straight play in Athens.
   The socialists banned censorship when they came to power in 1981,
and the satirists say they're not afraid of libel prosecution, even
for the bawdiest jokes about Papandreou and Liani.
   ``I feel really free. If I couldn't say the things I say I would
suffocate,'' said Lazopoulos, 31, who was acquitted in 1987 on
charges of slandering Greece's head of state, President Christos
Sartzetakis, in one of his shows.
   ``Greeks have no other way to let steam off. If they couldn't
laugh at their problems they would explode.''
   According to theater critic Eleni Varopoulou, the Greek revues'
mix of satirical sketches, monologues, songs and dance, is styled
after French revue and German cabaret.
   ``But the acidity of the satire is what characterizes the Greek
revue,'' she said.
   Other favorite targets are ordinary people's problems, from
family relations to the inadequate public health system introduced
by the socialists.
   Lazopoulos also mocks the premier's sick-bed television address
to the Greek people from London, in which he appealed for sympathy,
saying, ``I am fighting my own battle.''
   Lazopoulos replies in his show: ``What are you saying, you fool?
Battles are fought in Greek hospitals.''
   At the Kalouta theater, where the ``The Last PASOKrats'' is
playing, actress Anna Vayena explains how the system really works.
   ``In Greece we only diagnose. For therapy we have to go abroad,''
she says.
   Then she adds:``Andreas went to London because he didn't want to
kick a dozen Greek patients out of one hospital bed.''
   Varopoulou said the harsh Greek satire isn't aimed at making
people think, but at soothing and relieving them ``so that by
understanding their problem they exorcise it.''
   The satirical revues used to be staged like ancient comedy or
modern musicals, with a glamorous chorus-line, expensive costumes
and an all-star cast, but the current trend is toward less glitz and
more realism, Varopoulou said.
   Lazopoulos says he prefers the stripped-down staging, but notes
that the Aristophanic tradition is still going strong.
   ``I find we have the same attitude against authority as
Aristophanes. We can never match his writing but we can try to match
him in not being afraid to criticize,'' he said.

<HEAD>Team Plans Icewalk to Dramatize Arctic's Environmental Hazards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international expedition plans to walk 483 miles
across the ice to the North Pole in an effort to dramatize the
hazards they believe are threatening the arctic.
   The team, which includes members from Canada, the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain, Japan, Australia and West Germany, hopes
to set out on the 65-day trip around March 10-15 from Cape Columbia,
Canada's northernmost point of land on the Arctic Ocean.
   The American in the group is Darryl Roberts of the Bronx, N.Y.
   ``Everyone has to understand that this is no walk in the park,''
said Peter Baird, the Canadian liaison for the Icewalk expedition.
``This is a life-threatening project.''
   The expedition is led by Robert Swan, the British explorer who
walked to the South Pole with two other men in 1986. A successful
completion of the northern trip would make him the first on record
to walk to both poles.
   Baird is an administrator and will not be among the eight-member
team that walks to the North Pole. His Ottawa company, the Conexus
Research Group, served as the managers for the Canadian-Soviet ski
expedition that crossed the arctic ice cap last year to widespread
acclaim.
   Baird had no easy explanation for why adventurers seem to keep
trying to come up with new projects and goals in the arctic.
   ``Who knows what motivates them?'' he said. ``It's an athletic
thing, clearly, in some ways. It's the right to say you're first. .
.. And some sort of declaration that the human spirit is still alive
and kicking.''
   At around the time the Icewalk begins, another expedition will
have already started, if all goes on schedule, on a dog-sled trek
across the frozen Bering Strait separating Alaska and Soviet
Siberia. The purpose of the trek by a U.S.-Soviet team of 10 men and
two women is to call attention to the common cultural heritage of
the indigenous people living on both sides of the strait. The
two-month expedition is scheduled to depart from Anadyr, Siberia, on
March 1.
   The $4 million Icewalk to the North Pole has lined up Amway, the
Michigan-based marketing company, as its major corporate sponsor.
   The Icewalk is different from other similar ventures in that it
will use only human power. Supplies will be brought along in sledges
that require tremendous energy to haul their 250-300 pound cargoes.
The group will use skis, but there will be no dogsleds or
skimobiles. The team will be flown back after reaching its goal.
   It also hopes to attract attention by bringing an international
group of about 30 teen-age students to a base camp at Eureka on
Ellesmere Island to help with radio monitoring and to promote the
anti-pollution message.
   Team members will gather snow and atmospheric samples to record
pollution levels in the region. They will be testing for mercury _
said to be the first such tests in the region _ as well as tracking
sulphates, nitrates, chlorides and graphite particles. They also
will collect pollen samples to help find the origin of pollutants.
   Canadian research over the past four years has turned up dozens
of toxic substances in the region's fragile ecosystem, many of them
entering the food chain. Attention also has focused on the thinning
of the world's ozone layer, most notably at the world's poles, and
on acid rain.
   Baird said the team will spend about a month training at a base
camp before venturing out on the ice from Cape Columbia on the
65-day trip.
   ``There's only a certain window when you can do this,'' he added.
   Waiting warmer weather means too much open sea and drifting ice;
taking off too soon means too much harsh weather and temperatures
that are too cold.
   ``They can count on rough, rough ice _ sea ice _ for the first
100 kilometers (62 miles),'' Baird said. ``It's a maze; it's like a
giant jigsaw puzzle.''
   The temperatures could be as low as 70 degrees below zero
(Fahrenheit) at the outset, while winds could be as strong as about
55 miles an hour. The plans call for daily consumption of more than
6,000 calories by each member of the team to keep up energy.
   The Canadian on the team is Angus Clarence ``Kaanerk'' Cockney,
who is an Inuit, as Eskimos are called in Canada. He was born and
reared in Canada's Northwest Territories.

<HEAD>Sally Sussman Creates New Soap Opera for NBC</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sally Sussman, after more than a year of
plotting, planning and writing, is about to launch the new NBC
daytime serial ``Generations.''
   The story of three generations of two Chicago families, one
white, one black, ``Generations'' will make its debut on Monday,
March 27. It will be the first soap with a black family at its core
from the beginning, Sussman says.
   Sussman was hired away from CBS' ``The Young and the Restless''
to mold the serial, which is her first creation. It's also the first
new soap since CBS brought out ``The Bold and the Beautiful'' nearly
two years ago. And it's NBC's first new serial since ``Santa
Barbara'' in 1982.
   ``When they asked me to create the show they asked me if I had
any ideas,'' said Sussman, who is co-executive producer as well as
head writer.
   ``I did. I submitted a 20-page outline describing the two
families. I didn't have a story at that time. Then I wrote the
bible, which ran to 525 pages. It has eight or nine different
stories and I figure it will take us through the first two years.''
   Last October, after working alone for a year, she hired three
writers, Thom Racina, Elizabeth Harrower and Judi Ann Mason. Racina
and Harrower are experienced soap opera writers and Mason is a new
black writer.
   The writers now have 20 scripts completed and 30 outlined. The
taping will begin with 25 completed scripts and 10 in the works.
Sussman wants to stay five to six weeks ahead of taping and two
months ahead of the air date.
   The cast of ``Generations'' includes Taurean Blacque, Joan
Pringle, Patricia Crowley, Lynn Hamilton, Barbara Rhoades, Kristoff
St. John, Gail Ramsey, Andrew Masset and Jonelle Allen.
   ``We're going to keep the writers away from the production office
and studio,'' said Sussman. ``The production offices are too small
and too hectic. We need to be where it's quieter, more sane, and the
writers aren't pressured. We also have to work in secret because
we're so far ahead with the story. We don't want anyone to know what
we're doing until we're ready to reveal it.''
   Each actor auditioning for the roles was given a complete
biographical sketch of the character and read from special material
written for the audition.
   ``We want every actor to be thoroughly familiar with his
character,'' said Sussman. ``We want them to know who they are and
who all their relatives are. Before we start taping we're going to
meet individually with each actor and go over their character. It's
very important each has a strong knowledge of who they are.''
   Blacque, the head of the black family, will run a chain of ice
cream stores called Marshall's Chicago Ice Cream. His lawyer will be
Patricia Crowley, who heads the white family. The stories, covering
all the generations, will touch on both their business and personal
relationships.
   ``These are going to be stories of character and emotions,'' said
Sussman. ``It's not what I call the false reality of soap operas
where everyone's a private detective. It's more reality oriented.
We'll get into some black issues and social trends.''
   Dr. Troy Duster, a black professor of sociology at the University
of California at Berkeley, is a consultant to the show.
   NBC's affiliate stations will be offered alternative time slots
for the new half-hour show. It will be fed twice, for possible
airing at 11 or 11:30 a.m. and again for 12 or 12:30 p.m. This would
allow the stations to schedule the show around their noon newscasts.
``Generations'' will then lead into ``Days of Our Lives,'' NBC's
highest-rated daytime drama.
   Sussman, a native of Toronto, attended the University of Southern
California and was a management intern at NBC. Later, she became a
secretary and began writing comedy scripts on speculation. She sold
a script to ``Facts of Life'' and later joined the staff. She also
wrote for ``Knots Landing'' and ``Too Close for Comfort.''
   ``I was looking for the security of a steady job,'' she said. ``I
met some people at CBS and wrote a six-month story projection for
`The Young and the Restless.''' She was hired on the basis of that,
and spent five years with the show.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE CRIMES: ``Crimes of the Century'' is a new weekly syndicated
docudrama re-creating famous crimes, sometimes with the criminals
appearing to discuss the stories behind the headlines. Mike Connors
will be host of the show, which got its first exposure as specials
on ABC in November. Initial episodes of the half-hour show will be
on Dan White, who killed San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City
Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978; Caryl Chessman, executed in 1960 for
armed robbery and sexual assault; and the ``Zodiac Killer,'' who
killed a number of people in Northern California and is still at
large.

<HEAD>A Hard Measure of Stock Market Values</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With stock prices jumping around again, and
memories of 1987's vast overestimation of values still raw and
painful, the question arises again: Are stocks now sensibly priced?
   Sensible pricing isn't what some financial people say it is. It
isn't, for example, a hunch, a feeling or an expectation. It isn't
something from a guru's imagination. It isn't always what your
broker says it is.
   Instead, the market itself is probably the best measure of
sensible prices. It has a long record, and when prices depart from
the long-term trends the market is usually saying something you
should listen to.
   It did that in late 1987, when it indicated tremendous
overpricing. Those who heeded the warning escaped the crash. Those
who believed in ever-higher prices took their licks when the market
corrected to sensible levels.
   Here are some of the measures, as calculated by Wright Investors'
Service, an international research and portfolio management company
based in Bridgeport, Conn.:
   _Price-earnings ratios.
   On the basis of reported earnings, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock average is now priced about 11.5 times estimated 1989
earnings. That compares with an average PE of 13 for the past five
years, and 11.5 for the past 20 years. It is slightly below the
market's average of 12.7 since World War II.
   _Price-cash flow.
   The S&amp;P industrials are now priced about 6.8 times estimated 1989
corporate cash flow. The average of the past five years is 6.5. The
average for the past 20 years is 6.4.
   _Price-equity.
   The S&amp;P 500's current 2.0 price-equity multiple is a good deal
higher than the 1.8 average of the past five years, the 1.5 average
of the past 20 years and the 1.7 multiple of the past 40 years.
   However, says Wright, ``adjusting reported equity values for
retained earnings to account for the stock buybacks and buyouts
which have diluted equity since 1983 brings the price-equity ratio
to 1.77.''
   _Price-sales.
   The S&amp;P industrials today are priced at about 63 percent of
estimated 1989 sales. The average price-sales ratio of the past five
years is 58 percent. For the past 20-years the average is 57 percent.
   _Price-operating profits.
   After-tax profits from current production rose sharply for U.S.
corporations from 1982 through 1986. From midyear 1982 to midyear
1986 they jumped 125 percent, providing the basis for a 129 percent
rise in the S&amp;P 500.
   After the 1986 peak, operating profits retreated and have been
fairly flat recently. Currently, they are 10 percent below their
1986 peak, while the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 14 percent over the
same period.
   The S&amp;P 500 is now about 206 percent of its 1969-1988 average
price; operating profits are 172 percent of the 1969-1988 average,
leading Wright to comment that ``in relation to operating profits,
stock prices have gotten somewhat ahead of themselves.''
   This is Wright's overall conclusion: ``If the valuations of the
past 20 years are any guide, the stock market is currently a little
on the high side.''
   Wright researchers acknowledge one current activity that
conceivably could change measurements. ``If corporate takeovers are
here to stay, a new norm and higher valuations may be appropriate,''
they say. But they add a caveat:
   ``WIS is skeptical that a `new era' of stock valuation has begun.
The heightened takeover activity of the past five years has no doubt
inflated the asking price of many stocks, but it has also raised the
overall ... risk.''
   Wright's forecast: The stock market may be expected to move into
better line with earnings over the course of 1989. At best, this may
mean more of the same essentially sidewards price trend of the past
six months.
   ``A new bull market in equities may have to wait until 1990. Bond
returns are likely to exceed equity returns during 1989.''

<HEAD>Bennett Holds Key for Effectiveness of Drug Czar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Bennett has marching orders from
President Bush to get rid of the drug ``scourge,'' but it will be up
to the nation's first drug czar to determine how he will wield his
newly created powers.
   Some law enforcement agencies that opposed creation of a drug
czar question whether Bennett will be able to do anything more than
try to reduce demand. And they say their drug-control efforts won't
change just because Congress created a new job, formally called
director of National Drug Control Policy.
   ``My sense is that Bill Bennett and his mission will be to
concentrate on ... reduction of demand,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said recently. ``We in law enforcement have our job to
do, no matter who's up top, and we're going to do it.''
   A transition official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, said that Bennett would keep close tabs on law
enforcement efforts, including those by the FBI and the Drug
Enforcement Agency. But he said he also expects Bennett to use the
job as a ``bully pulput'' to encourage people to stop using drugs _
just as he did during his 3{ years as education secretary under
Ronald Reagan.
   Bennett declined to discuss his plans for the job until his
confirmation hearings, aide John Walters said.
   An official involved in coordinating drug control efforts in the
past said Congress didn't give the drug czar much power. ``He gets
to advise on a lot of things and recommend a lot of things, but
that's about it.''
   That is disputed by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who fought for
eight years to create a Cabinet-rank drug czar. The legislation
creating the job was passed by Congress and signed into law by
Reagan late last year.
   The legislation's fine print requires each agency to write down,
in detail, why it doesn't want to go along with any plan or
budgetary decision of the drug czar, Biden said.
   Faced with the possibility that the agencies could be singled out
for lack of cooperation, ``they'll sign on,'' Biden said.
   ``I'm confident Bennett can be a strong director,'' Biden said,
noting that during his tenure as Education secretary Bennett was
``strong-willed and not afraid to butt heads with the bureaucracy.
He's not a guy worried about being criticized. ... That's a
necessary ingredient for this job.''
   He added, however, that Bennett ``has no demonstrable experience
on either the law enforcement side of the drug problem nor to the
best of my knowledge, any detailed views on the education-prevention
side. I think the key will be who he picks as his top aides.''
   Bush raised the drug issue to the fore when, in his inaugural
adress, he said, ``This scourge will stop.''
   But he also said the ``overriding problem of the deficit'' would
make it difficult to increase spending on law-enforcement efforts,
so the main thrust of the drug war would be education.
   And he decided not to include Bennett in his Cabinet where,
symbolically at least, he would have been on equal footing with
heads of departments involved in the drug war efforts.
   At his first presidential news conference, Bush defended his
decision to exclude Bennett from the Cabinet.
   ``The reason he isn't in the Cabinet is that I've tried to reduce
down the numbers of full Cabinet members.'' Bush told reporters
Friday. ``And I think that Bill Bennett's time is best spent not
worrying about agricultural subsidies but concentrating on drugs.''
   Bush said he would make clear to the Cabinet secretaries that he
was insisting on their cooperation with Bennett.
   FBI Director William Sessions, when asked how Bennett and the FBI
would work together, did not even address the role Bennett would
play.
   ``Our drug strategy has been defined since 1986,'' he told USA
Today. ``It is to attack major drug traffickers and money-laundering
organizations dealing in heroin and cocaine with long-term
investigations, using court-authorized electronic surveillance and
other methods that will allow us to solve those particular crimes
and present a case that will deal with a major organization.''
   FBI spokesman Tom McPoyle said, ``We think it's premature at this
point'' to discuss the FBI's relation to the drug czar or his
policies. ``It's foolhardy to fashion some kind of response to
something that doesn't exist yet.''
   But the FBI isn't just involved in law enforcement. Sessions has
said one agent in each field office has been assigned to handle
efforts to reduce the demand for drugs, even though such programs
already are being conducted by other agencies.
   To Biden, that's a perfect example of the kind of decisions
Bennett will have to make.
   ``Why do we have demand-reduction people in the FBI, and 4,000
people in demand reduction at the Department of Education, and
demand reduction in Treasury?'' Biden asked. ``That's what he is
there to solve.''
   Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson of the Coast Guard says that some of the
turf battles among agencies already have been resolved, but that the
agencies are waiting to see what Bennett will do.
   ``What's going to happen under the drug czar? I don't think
anybody knows that except Mr. Bennett,'' Simpson said.
   Part of the unknown, he said, is ``exactly how much power the
drug czar is going to have. I think that'll be defined by the first
guy in the office.
   ``I don't think anybody considers Mr. Bennett a shy individual,''
Simpson said. ``But on the other hand, what direction is he going to
take?''
   Working on the assumption that Bennett won't throw out everything
that's been done before, Simpson said. ``We're going ahead with the
things we were planning on doing all along ... until the new people
come in and indicate a change of directions.''
   When he was Education Secretary, Bennett called for involvement
of the military in the drug war, reportedly advising in one memo:
``The military should do to the drug barons what our forces in the
Persian Gulf did to Iran's navy.''
   Maj. David Super, a Pentagon spokesman, said Defense Department
officials are holding to their determination not to ``step over the
line to police functions. ... We want that responsibility to remain
with civilian authorities.''

<HEAD>`Old and Inefficient' Military Supermarket Going Out of Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of the busiest supermarkets in the
world is posting a ``going out of business'' sign on its doors and
telling thousands of happy, loyal customers to go elsewhere.
   The Army's Cameron Station, a sprawling supply facility and
cut-rate grocery store for the military in this Washington suburb,
is one of 34 bases slated to be closed under a Defense Department
cost-cutting plan announced in December.
   A Pentagon commission said 120-year-old Cameron Station was ``old
and inefficient'' and should be shut down to save taxpayers $13.3
million a year.
   Unless Congress takes the unlikely step of overruling the
Pentagon, the Cameron Station commissary will be closed in the next
few years despite nearly $31 million in annual sales last year.
   Receipts like that make Cameron Station the envy of the
supermarket giants. And it's only open during the day, five days a
week.
   When the station is closed, its grocery business probably will
shift not far away to the mammoth commissary at Fort Belvoir, Va.,
the king of the Army's 178 worldwide commissaries with $64.3 million
in sales last year.
   The supermarket chains keep their sales figures a closely guarded
secret. But Food World, a reliable industry journal, estimates that
the average Giant Food store in the Washington metropolitan area, by
comparison, posted $18.5 million in annual sales as of last May. The
figure for the other major chain, Safeway Stores, was $11.4 million.
   As many as 40,000 customers, most of them military retirees, push
their loaded shopping carts past 18 checkout counters at Cameron
Station every month.
   The store boasts everything its civilian competitors offer,
except for alcoholic beverages, automotive accessories, a jewelry
and cosmetics counter or a pharmacy.
   ``Cheaper prices _ that's our big draw,'' says Len Langford, the
civilian assistant manager at Cameron Station, and his customers
agree.
   They say the commissary's low prices save them 25 percent to 30
percent of the checkout counter tab at Giant or Safeway, the two
biggest supermarkets on the outside.
   With a current operating subsidy of $743 million from Congress,
the commissaries sell everything at cost, plus a 5 percent surcharge
to cover overhead expenses.
   Altogether, the 431 military commissaries racked up $5.2 billion
in worldwide sales last year, making them the seventh largest
grocery chain in the country. The estimated $1.8 billion difference
between commissary and supermarkets prices is regarded as a pay
supplement for military families.
   Langford said his shoppers drive here from throughout Washington
and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs to load up on bargains. ``One
guy and his wife drive all the way from upstate New York near the
Canadian border to shop here every six months,'' he said.
   ``I've been going to the commissary all my life,'' said Betty
Tychsen, wife of a retired Air Force colonel who loaded a dozen
grocery bags of bargains into the trunk of her car at the Cameron
Station parking lot.
   ``It's close to my home, the produce is good and I seem to get
through the checkout lines quickly,'' she said. ``We get everything
we need here, and my husband says we save 20 percent by shopping
here.''
   ``I'm going to miss it,'' said Cosy Schneberger, wife of a Navy
commander at the Pentagon who hits Cameron Station every three weeks
to stock up. ``You can find most everything you want. I hope they do
something to take care of everyone when they close.''
   In the parking lot at Fort Belvoir, Lance Cpl. James Pearson of
Billings, Mont., a 24-year-old with a wife and baby, drives 30 miles
both ways from their home on the Marine base at Quantico, Va., to
shop for commissary bargains.
   Pearson says the commissary is a lifesaver on his paycheck of
$382 every two weeks. He figures the $120 worth of groceries they
buy at Fort Belvoir every payday would cost an additional $75 if
they shopped elsewhere.
   ``If we didn't have this, we'd go pretty hungry,'' he said.
``We'd have pretty empty grocery bags when we got home.''
   Capt. Earl Hemminger, who lives in nearby Springfield, Va., with
his wife and 2-year-old daughter, buys most of his groceries at the
Belvoir commissary, but says his enlisted men need the $50-a-month
savings more than he does.
   ``To a private living in a high-cost area like Washington, $50 a
month is a lot of money,'' he said. ``As it is, a lot of soldiers
have to work a second job till midnight to make ends meet.''
   The big food chains complain that the commissaries enjoy an
unfair competitive advantage because of their government operating
subsidy and ability to sell groceries virtually at cost.
   Barry Scher, a Giant Food spokesman, said commissaries are needed
for military bases in remote rural areas but are ``a waste of the
government's money'' in large urban areas adequately served by
private supermarkets.
   In 1983, the Grace Commission, a presidential advisory group
seeking ways to eliminate government waste, urged the military to
get out of the grocery business. It said military commissaries
should be closed or turned over to private industry for a savings of
up to $2.5 billion.
   That proposal got nowhere in Congress, where commissary
privileges were defended as a sacred fringe benefit regarded by
low-paid enlistees as second only to free medical care.
   At a 1984 hearing, members of the House Armed Services Committee
listened sympathetically as military wives lambasted the suggestion
that equally cheap groceries could be found beyond the base gates.
   ``We don't want food warehouses, we don't want generic brands and
we don't want to be second-class citizens,'' said Sandra Newton, who
lived at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.
   Said Ella Galluccio, an Army wife from Fort Bragg, N.C.: ``Small
children do not feel okay when they have to eat corn flakes out of
plain white boxes without any prizes, when other children are eating
Pac-Man cereal and Cheerios.''

   Co-workers probably tumbled in laughter when
someone not too long ago adjusted his tie, stood up in the boardroom
and said with a straight face, ``I predict people will actually pay
real money to watch fake wrestling on television.''
   But the idea was so crazy it was brilliant. In today's expanding
universe of pay-per-view television, no programming concoction is
too outrageous for those addicted viewers cruising for a new video
fix.
   With pay-per-view, cable television subscribers can wolf down a
buffet of television ``events'' _ including movies, concerts, boxing
and more than enough wrestling _ without winching themselves off the
sofa. Seats are front-row and, best of all, there are usually no
stupid commercials.
   Car-race fanatics with $13 to spare can see the Miller High Life
500 on June 17 with no breaks in the action.
   Stir-crazy businessmen, taking shelter in some Holiday Inn, can
fork over $7 for a private television broadcast of a soft-core porno
movie.
   Thousands of viewers are expected to shell out 15 bucks in April
to watch Evel Knievel's son go motorcycle jumping.
   And in 1992, NBC will offer up to 200 hours of selected Summer
Olympic events on a pay-per-view basis, the network announced Dec.
22.
   With so many options, there's a heap of money coming through the
door. Pay-per-view will become a billion-dollar industry within 10
years, up from less than $100 million in 1988, according to industry
estimates.
   ``It's completely convenient,'' said Jerry Hartman, vice
president of marketing and sales for Universal Pay TV. ``At eight
o'clock, if you're bored, you can watch something. You don't have to
get up. You don't have to go to the video store or anywhere else.''
   In theory, the pay-per-view process is simple enough: you order
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' at 7 p.m., it arrives de-scrambled on your
television set an hour later, and the movie's charged on your next
bill. In practice, however, it can be a more frustrating experience.
   While most of today's pay-per-view transactions (from $5 to $40)
are conducted over the phone, future technologies may streamline the
process to a single remote control. Optical-fiber
``video-on-demand'' cable systems, now being tested in Southern
California by GTE Corp., will supply hundreds more titles at any
time in the day.
   For pay-per-view companies, the easier the transaction, the
brighter the future. Parents, beware.
   Pay-per-view caters to the same impulsive buyers who grab cheap
pens and eyeglass nose cushions at supermarket checkouts _ never
realizing they could probably do without until it's too late. With
pay-per-view, though, there's the added chance that, just once, the
purchase could be electrifying.
   About 600,000 fans optimistically coughed up $35 per home to
watch last June's ``fight'' between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks,
which ended abruptly after 91 seconds. The Nov. 7 title match
between Sugar Ray Leonard and Donny Lalonde brought in close to $20
million in pay-per-view grosses, just behind the Tyson-Spinks
receipts.
   ``I think people love the excitement of a big championship
fight,'' said Jeffrey Reiss, chairman of pay-per-view giant Request
Television. ``You can have a group of people over to the house for
the price of one ticket ... and have a beer and popcorn party.''
   Nielsen ratings that would make network programmers scribble out
suicide notes can be solid gold on pay-per-view, due to higher
profit margins. ``We can make money on one rating point,'' said
Scott Kurnit, president of Showtime Event Television.
   Although pay-per-view has been workable throughout the 1980s,
only 21 percent of the country's 45 million cable households now
have equipment permitting phone orders. That figure may double by
1990, and 40 million homes may have access to pay-per-view by 1994,
according to estimates by Paul Kagan Associates, a media research
firm.
   Yet the long-touted promise of pay-per-view has been slow in
arriving, stalled by poor marketing, film-studio fears and
technological obstacles.
   Cable television's reputation for poor customer service hasn't
encouraged subscribers to experiment with a more complicated
product. ``There's still a long way to go in consumer marketing,''
said Tim Clott, executive vice president of the video division at
Paramount Pictures. ``And we want to find a technology that
prohibits home taping.''
   The studios don't want pay-per-view broadcasts to undermine the
$2 billion home video market. Worried that pay-per-view customers
will videotape their purchases, the studios typically offer movies
to pay-per-view systems more than a month after their home-video
debut, thereby dulling the excitement.
   Meanwhile, pay-per-view program options continue expanding.
   Robbie Knievel, Evel's son, will try to hurdle the Caesar's
Palace fountains on April 14. ABC, CBS and NBC won't have it, but
you can see the leap (or crash) on Showtime Event Television. On
Feb. 10, Request Television will carry a taped concert of Frank
Sinatra, Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr., at $14.95.
   Leaders in the pay-per-view business are predicting that Broadway
openings, more pop music concerts, art auctions, business seminars
and possibly the Super Bowl and the World Series soon could become
pay-per-view staples.
   So, in the end, pay-per-view's future may lie in giving customers
those unusual attractions they can't find at theaters, in video
stores, or on any other broadcast or cable television channel.
   Said Showtime's Kurnit: ``We've always looked at the event
business as where we'll make our money.''
   What the word ``event'' comes to mean, though, is anybody's guess.

   After 27 years of fighting, the Soviet-backed
Ethiopian government and separatist rebels in Eritrea province say
they're ready to negotiate a settlement of Africa's longest war.
   But many obstacles remain in the way, namely finding a suitable
mediator and overcoming the deep divisions among the rebel groups
themselves.
   The conflict has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, driven
nearly a Eritrean million refugees westward into neighboring Sudan
and compounded the suffering from the region's devastating famine.
   The rebels, who scored major battlefield victories last spring
and reported new gains in late December, say they are tightening
their siege around a key government-held city while bracing for a
new Ethiopian offensive.
   The guerrillas, led by the dominant Eritrean People's Liberation
Front (EPLF), which along with other rebel factions has offices in
Rome, control about three-fourths of the territory. The government
holds most of the major cities.
   Eritrea is situated on the strategic Horn of Africa, which
overlooks the Red Sea approach to the Suez Canal as well a key water
route to the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. Slightly larger than
Pennsylvania, Eritrea has a 1,000-mile coastline along the Red Sea
across from southern Saudi Arabia.
   A former Italian colony, Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia in
1952 under a U.S.-sponsored resolution in the United Nations. The
Eritreans' battle for independence began in 1961. Emperor Haile
Selassie annexed the territory in 1962.
   (Selassie was overthrown in 1974 by the military that established
today's Marxist government; he died in detention in 1975.)
   As the conflict has worn one, the Eritreans have built a
self-reliant society. The rebels, who receive no significant outside
military or financial support, have built an array of schools,
hospitals and workshops _ some of them underground or in hillside
caverns to avoid detection from the air _ that contribute both to
the war effort and the needs of the general population.
   In March 1987, the main secessionist groups adopted a
constitution and a national program.
   In interviews in Rome, the Eritreans acknowledged that
differences in ideology and strategy have led to fighting among
themselves, but they all declared a willingness to negotiate with
Ethiopia. They contended, however, that President Mengistu Haile
Maniam of Ethiopia was not sincere in his expressed desire for a
settlement.
   In particular, the Eritreans condemned Mengistu's meeting in his
capital, Addis Ababa, in late December with what Ethiopia described
as a delegation of the Eritrean Liberation Front. The ELF, the
oldest of the rebel groups, has split into several rival factions
over the years.
   The delegation reportedly agreed to have the province of 3.5
million people divided into two autonomous regions, one for Moslems
and the other for Christians. According to Addis Ababa radio, the
Ethiopian Politburo accepted that idea and sent a proposal to
Parliament, or Shengo, for final approval in June.
   The Eritreans interviewed in Rome maintained that those who met
with Mengistu were former rebels who now live in Arab countries of
the Persian Gulf and do not represent any of the legitimate
organizations.
   ``They are traitors,'' said Asefau Bariamikael, vice president of
the ELF-National Council.
   ``This is just an attempt by Ethiopia to create divisions and
shows their lack of seriousness in confronting the problem,'' said
Solomon Kinfe, an EPLF fighter and representative here.
   ``Ethiopia has always tried to divide Eritrea on basis of
religion, but religion has always been an element of unification,''
said Taha Nur of the ELF-United Organization.
   Still, all three groups said they are willing to talk through a
mediator and that the United Nations should reopen the Eritrean
issue.
   ``We are ready to participate actively in solving the problem
politically and ready to negotiate with the Ethiopian government
without preconditions,'' Nur said.
   Previously, some of the groups had said they would negotiate only
on condition that independence would be discussed.
   ``Once we sit down, then we will make our proposal for complete
independence,'' Bariamikael of the ELF-National Council, said. ``If
they (Ethiopians) don't want to hear it beforehand, we'll just say
it later. But we won't change our mind about complete independence.''
   Kinfe said the EPLF continues to demand that the conflict be
settled by a referendum offering Eritreans three choices:
independence, regional autonomy or a return to federation.

   Although ideology is one factor dividing the rebel groups, the
political outlook of each of them remains vague and none has set
forth any ideological platform on which they would govern Eritrea.
   The dominant EPLF is considered the most left-leaning and is
widely considered Marxist-oriented. The group itself rejects any
political identification tag, saying it is neither Marxist nor
imperialist and has no superpower backing.
   Margherita Boniver, a Socialist member of the Italian Parliament
who has been to Eritrea, said, ``Some of the groups consider the
EPLF fanatics. But the EPLF people are very well informed about the
international scene, and after 27 years of fighting, I doubt they
would opt for a Marxist society.''
   Bariamikael of the ELF-National Council said, ``We all want
Eritrea as a democratic nation, represented by parliament and
different parties.''
   The Ethiopian government has not recently stated its position on
negotiations with the rebels. Telephone calls by The Associated
Press to officials at the Ethiopian embassy in Rome were not
returned. However, in a document issued in July, the government said
it was ready to negotiate on the basis of the new constitution for
regional autonomy in Eritrea but ruled out independence.
   Sudan's ambassador in Rome, Ibrahim Ayoub, confirmed that
Ethiopia approached his government last year and asked for its
mediation. Sudan agreed as part of an effort to settle all conflicts
in the Horn of Africa and is seeking ``to clarify the position of
both parties,'' Ayoub said. Sudan shares the west shore of the Red
Sea with Eritrea and Egypt.
   While the ELF-United Organization has backed mediation by Sudan,
the EPLF has rejected the Sudanese because of their Moslem-dominated
government's war against Christian guerrillas in southern Sudan.
   ``The EPLF prefers that mediation efforts are better undertaken
by third parties that are not in any way involved in the conflicts
in the region,'' the EPLF said in a statement on Jan. 17.
   Italy has also been mentioned as a possible mediator, an issue
that came up during a visit to Ethiopia last fall by an Italian
Parliament delegation.
   ``Mengistu said that Italy could have a role in settling the
Eritrean question,'' said Mrs. Boniver, the Italian Parliament
member and president of Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
   ``Italy should take up this very serious offer and try to start
negotiations either trilaterally or involving other countries,''
said Mrs. Boniver, who visited Eritrea briefly last year and plans
to return with other Parliament members this year.
   On the military front, the Eritreans say they want to consolidate
their victories of last spring. In March, EPLF guerrillas broke
through a 10-year-old front south of their headquarters in Nacfa and
overran the government-held town of Afabet, capturing three Soviet
military advisers in the process.
   Since then, rebels have carried out hit-and-run raids on the
naval bases at Massawa and Masab. In a communique in mid-January,
the EPLF claimed to have killed more than 2,000 Ethiopian soldiers
along the state road connecting Asmara, the provincial capital, and
Massawa.
   Kinfe said the EPLF has been entrenched for months around the
Ethiopian-held city of Keren in north-central Eritrea and the group
is expecting the government to launch an offensive soon to try to
break the siege.
   According to the Military Balance, a survey published by the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, the EPLF
has about 30,000 fighters. Ethiopia has a 315,000-member military,
not including Cuban, Soviet and East German advisers and technicians.
   While the Ethiopians have been armed by the Soviets, the rebels
rely mostly with captured government equipment, including T-54 and
T-55 tanks and heavy artillery. Ethiopia controls the skies, with
Soviet-supplied MiG warplanes and helicopters.

   Here are some facts and figures on Eritrea:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Eritrea is Ethiopia's northernmost province, covering
48,000 square miles, slightly larger than Pennsylvania. It is
bordered by Sudan to the north and west, the former French colony of
Djibouti to the southeast and the Red Sea forms its 625-mile eastern
border. Without Eritrea, Ethiopia would be landlocked. The territory
has the only non-Arab access to the Red Sea. Assab and Massawa are
its major seaports and Asmara, Ethiopia's second largest town, is
its capital.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Eritrea's 3.5 million people speak nine languages
and are nearly evenly divided between Moslems and Christians. Eighty
percent of the people are rural and 30 percent of them are nomads.
Secessionist rebels claim 500,000 are refugees in neighboring Sudan.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Before the war, Asmara was the industrial center of
Ethiopia. Mineral resources include gold, iron and copper but they
have not been exploited because of the war. Traces of oil also have
been found offshore, but the war has prevented further exploration.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ For most of its 3,000-year history, Eritrea has been
coveted by foreign powers because of its strategic geographic
position. The region fought off invaders for centuries before the
Ottoman Empire established a foothold on the coast in 1557. Three
hundred years later, Egypt occupied the eastern and western
lowlands. European domination came in 1891 when Italy colonized the
entire region and gave it the name Eritrea, derived from the ancient
Greek name for the Red Sea. During World War II, Italian forces of
dictator Benito Mussolini used Eritrea as a staging area for the
invasion of Ethiopia. Allied armies took Eritrea in 1941 and for the
next 11 years it was under British military administration. Eritrean
leaders pushed for independence, but Ethiopia, yearning for an
access to the Red Sea, received the strong backing of the United
States and in 1952 Eritrea was federated as an autonomous state with
Ethiopia. On Sept. 1, 1961, the Eritrean Liberation Front was formed
and civil war began. On Nov. 14, 1962, Ethiopia abolished the
federation and its armies occupied Eritrea.

<HEAD>Tax Breaks For Dividends Could Dampen Buyout Borrowing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Congress goes through with its plan to
eliminate the double taxation of corporate dividends, the result
could be a boost in prices on Wall Street and a reduction in the
massive borrowing that has bankrolled the wave of corporate buyouts.
   But it is questionable whether the lawmakers will have the nerve
to go through with any plan that could reduce federal revenue at the
same time they are grappling with the huge federal deficit.
   Congress is considering two proposals on corporate taxation as
part of its examination of the leveraged buyout phenomenon. One
proposal would restrict the tax deduction that corporations now
enjoy on interest payments stemming from borrowing. The other would
ease the levy on dividends, which are taxed both at the corporate
level and as income to individual investors.
   Lawmakers returned to work in January eager to muffle the
explosion of corporate debt that accompanied the multibillion-dollar
buyouts of major companies at the end of last year. After a week's
worth of hearings on the subject, the combination of curtailed
benefits for debt and a new tax break for dividends seemed to be
gaining favor.
   It's also the approach preferred by key Bush administration
officials, such as Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who are
anxious to guard against another calamity on Wall Street like the
crash of 1987, which was precipitated in part by talk of changing
the tax rules on takeovers.
   Proponents of the two-pronged plan say tightening the corporate
interest-deduction provision could balance revenue lost from
eliminating the double taxation of dividends. But both remain
contentious issues.
   While Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told the
Senate Finance Committee he was concerned about the level of
corporate borrowing stemming from takeovers, he said he was opposed
to any restrictions on the deductibility of corporate interest from
loans and bonds.
   He said such limits could have unintended consequences that could
actually reduce tax revenue, and that companies and financiers would
find a way around any restrictions.
   Earlier in the week, David S. Ruder, chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, also said he was opposed to any change in
the interest deductibility. He warned that any tinkering with the
tax laws to curb takeovers could cause panic in a stock market he
called ``skittish and nervous.''
   That caution was echoed Friday by President Bush, who said at a
news conference that he didn't think it was the government's place
to restrict the level of corporate borrowing.
   As for the other proposal, eliminating the double taxation on
dividends most likely would lead to price rises in stocks that pay
dividends because the dividends would be more valuable. That, in
turn, could have another beneficial effect: making it more
attractive for corporations to raise funds for buyouts and
restructurings through sales of stock instead of through borrowing.
   Greenspan, Brady and Ruder all welcomed the plan to ease the tax
burden on dividends. But none offered any magic formula to do so
without worsening the federal deficit.
   In other major business and economic news this past week:
   _The U.S. economy shook off the effects of the stock market crash
and the drought to grow at a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, the best
performance in four years, the government reported. The increase in
the gross national product was powered by a big improvement in the
U.S. trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital
investment. Meanwhile, Greenspan told a congressional panel that the
Fed believes inflation is too high and that it will act to curb it.
   _The Treasury Department suggested a fee of about 25 cents on
every $100 deposited in savings and loan accounts to raise money for
the government insurance fund backing S&amp;Ls. The proposal encountered
immediate criticism and was given little chance of moving ahead.
Meanwhile, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, said the bank board was suing three of the so-called ``Big
Eight'' accounting firms, as well as others, for failing to uncover
losses and abuses in S&amp;Ls that later failed.
   _The threat of prison reportedly encouraged at least 30 suspects
in the commodities scandal to cooperate in the massive federal
investigation of alleged fraud at two futures exchanges. Subpoenas
to appear before a grand jury have been served on more than 200
brokers, traders and trading firms associated with the Chicago Board
of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Meanwhile, the Merc
appointed a panel to review its rules and recommend revisions and
improvements.
   _Court documents revealed that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed
to dismiss Michael Milken, its senior junk-bond trader, as part of
its record $650 million plea-bargain deal with prosecutors on fraud
charges. Sources said prosecutors offered a plea-bargain deal to
Milken two weeks ago but his lawyers rejected it.

<BYLINE>American Raises Some Discount Fares; Other Airlines Follow Suit</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Increases in some discounted MaxSaver fares that
take effect today and next week have analysts wondering whether
passengers could be in for another round of fare hikes.
   American Airlines raised its so-called MaxSaver fares on flights
from its Dallas-Fort Worth hub to 40 U.S. cities, American
spokeswoman Mary O'Neill said Thursday. Several other big carriers
followed suit.
   The $40 round-trip hike will apply to 20 West Coast cities and a
number of East Coast destinations, while MaxSaver fares to several
cities in the central United States will be raised by $20 round
trip. The higher fares take effect today for the West Coast cities
and Feb. 1 for the other destinations.
   For example, American raised its round-trip MaxSaver fare between
Dallas-Fort Worth and Los Angeles from $258 off-peak to $298, and
from $298 peak to $338. MaxSavers between the Dallas hub and
Cincinnati will go from $238 off-peak to $258, and from $278 peak to
$298.
   Spokesmen for other major carriers _ including United Airlines
and Delta Air Lines _ said they were matching American's move in the
same markets.
   Continental Airlines, often a fare-cutting leader, said it
matched the West Coast increases but was still studying the others.
Pan Am Corp. was reviewing the situation.
   Fares normally are not lifted at this time of year, which usually
is a slack period for travel. But passenger traffic has been fairly
strong in recent weeks, analysts say.
   ``They (the airlines) evidently feel very confident that the
traffic is very strong and can sustain another fare increase,'' said
Kevin Murphy, an industry analyst for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   The move is ``setting the tone for more (fare) increases this
summer,'' he said.
   All of the fares now being raised by American had been cut in
mid-November when the entire industry revamped its MaxSaver fares,
Ms. O'Neill said. At that time the major carriers, led by
Continental, lowered some of the popular discount fares but boosted
most of them.
   ``We couldn't justify that fare in those markets,'' Ms. O'Neill
said.
   MaxSaver tickets _ which are used mainly by vacation travelers _
must be purchased seven to 14 days in advance and require a Saturday
night stay. In the November revamp, the fares were based on the
length of a flight. Competition on individual routes, not mileage,
had determined MaxSaver rates in the past.
   The MaxSaver change came just days after Continental initiated an
industry move to drop discounts aimed at business travelers.
   As a result of the latest fare hikes, 27 of the 40 affected
MaxSaver fares will still be lower than they were before the
November restructuring, Ms. O'Neill said.
   American serves a total network of about 5,000 markets.
   ``It's coming at an unusual time of year for there to be fare
hikes,'' said Thomas Longman, who follows the industry for Bear
Stearns &amp; Co. ``They've seen stronger traffic in those markets than
they thought.''
   Andrew Geller, an airline analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, estimates that passenger traffic currently is up 5
percent to 8 percent from its level a year ago.
   Robust passenger demand last year spurred the airlines to raise
fares an average 10 percent from 1987, he said.

   The energy futures market tumbled as traders
expressed disappointment in the outcome of a joint meeting between
OPEC and independent oil-producing nations in London.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ plunged 40
cents Thursday to settle at $17.72 a barrel, the lowest level of the
session. The contract had jumped 58 cents on Wednesday and hit a
high of $18.48 at one point Thursday.
   Among refined petroleum contracts traded on the exchange
Thursday, February home heating oil closed down 1.26 cents at 50.87
cents a gallon, after rising 1.43 cents on Wednesday.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which rose 1.30
cents on Wednesday, settled off 1.65 cents at 49.87 cents a gallon.
   The seven non-OPEC countries, including Mexico and Egypt, said
after the daylong meeting in London Thursday that they'd support
OPEC's target price of $18 a barrel. But they didn't specify in a
joint statement with OPEC whether they would cut their oil
production to do so, and analysts said that troubled many traders.
   ``They didn't recommend any specific action,'' said Nauman
Barakat, vice president of energy investments at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``Their statement was so vague that it didn't really
mean anything.''
   Speculation that independent producers might offer to cut their
collective oil production by at least 5 percent had sent oil prices
sharply higher on Wednesday and early Thursday, following a selloff
on Tuesday.
   OPEC General Secretary Subroto said that the 5 percent cut ``is
an option.''
   Oil prices have risen sharply since early October, a month before
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to limit
its production to 18.5 million barrels a day. The agreement was
effective Jan. 1.
   OPEC members are now producing an estimated 19.5 million barrels
a day, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourth
quarter.

<HEAD>Shell-Shocked Farmers Fear Another Dry Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An unusually warm and dry winter is worrying farmers from
Illinois to Michigan who fear a repeat of the 1988 drought.
   ``There's a pervading omen, a feeling of ominous concern. I sense
it with other farmers, I sense it with the salesmen of agricultural
products,'' said Joe Summer, a McLean County corn and soybean farmer
in central Illinois.
   For the first time in 45 years of farming, Summer is taking out
multi-peril insurance on next season's crop.
   ``We're all beginning to get a little paranoid about it,'' the
62-year-old farmer said. ``There is no frost in the ground. This
unusually warm weather is strange. It is a harbinger of some sort, I
think.''
   Forecasters for the National Weather Service say severe to
extreme drought conditions continue in much of the northern Great
Plains, northern Rockies and parts of the Midwest.
   But the most recent 30-day forecast calls for above-normal
precipitation, said meteorologist Edward O'Lenic with the service's
climate analysis offices in Washington, D.C.
   The agency will not release its spring forecast until after the
commodities markets close Monday, but O'Lenic said there is no
reason to expect more of the drought that hit much of the nation
last summer.
   Even so, farmers and their farm bureaus are worried.
   ``If we don't get some snowfall, we could go into the spring
lacking the snowmelt,'' said Michigan Farm Bureau spokesman Al Almy.
``Potentially, we could be on the short side.''
   Farm bureau officials in Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois
and Iowa say the same.
   ``At this stage, we're hoping for a terribly wet spring,'' said
Gerald Hagaman, administrator of the Minnesota Farm Bureau.
``There's apprehension.''
   Spring rains will quench the top soil, but farmers have lost deep
soil moisture, their one insurance against drought, said Dennis
Vercler with the Illinois Farm Bureau.
   ``They're edgy about it. We're going into the season needing just
the right rain at just the right time,'' Vercler said.
   Lack of precipitation is not the only worry.
   ``If we stay relatively mild, the real problem is that it doesn't
kill a lot of the pests,'' said Don Henderson, vice president of the
Indiana Farm Bureau, where January temperatures have averaged 34.1
degrees.
   Sheets of ice have coated snowless fields in Wisconsin and
southern Michigan off and on for the past three weeks, causing a
different danger for winter crops of wheat and alfalfa _ icing.
   ``If part of an alfalfa field is coated with ice, it can smother
the plants to death,'' said Wisconsin Farm Bureau President Don
Haldeman.
   Cycles of freezing and thawing also have set up a heaving and
uprooting problem for winter wheat, Almy said in Michigan. ``And if
it should suddenly turn cold, the lack of snow cover could expose
the plants,'' he said.
   The one bright spot is that mild weather is making the winter
easier on livestock, farming officials said.
   The National Weather Service's most recent precipitation map
shows extreme drought in Montana, the Dakotas, central Minnesota,
eastern Iowa, northwestern Illinois and much of Wyoming, eastern
Idaho, central Washington and eastern Oregon, said meteorologist
Dave Miskus from the Climate Analysis Center.
   ``It sure does cause concern,'' said Enid Schlipf, another McLean
County farmer in Illinois. ``We don't understand what's happening.''

<HEAD>Sundstrand Back Bidding on Government Contracts After Settling Differences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp., whian additional $62.3
million to the Pentagon, officials say.
   ``We're looking forward to returning to a normal relationship
with the government,'' company spokesman Claude Vernam said
Thursday, moments after the Defense Department lifted its ban on
Sundstrand's participation in the military procurement process.
   That move followed an announcement that the Rockford-based
aerospace manufacturing giant would make cost-saving concessions on
future contracts and pay $62.3 million to resolve differences
stemming from a lengthy investigation that resulted in criminal
charges against the company.
   Last October, a federal judge approved a plea agreement in which
Sundstrand admitted defrauding the government and paid $115 million
in fines as part of the largest contract fraud settlement in Defense
Department history.
   Spokesman Larry Wilson of the Defense Logistics Agency, which
administers contracts, said the new agreement would provide the
Pentagon, in effect, with some price guarantees on future contracts
by forcing the company to modify the way it allocates charges
between its commercial and military work.
   The agreement also called for Sundstrand to make an immediate
cash payment of $40 million; followed by a separate payment of $9.9
million ``on or before Sept. 1,'' and payments totaling $12.4
million to be made in equal annual installments of $2.48 million
over the next five years.
   Wilson said savings from the accounting changes could eventually
total another $34 million.
   The agreement and Sundstrand's return to the bidding process was
greeted with optimism Thursday on Wall Street. In trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, Sundstrand rose $1.62{ a share to $54.25.
   But in a statement, Sundstrand put the cost of the agreement at
$71.3 million over the next five years _ considerably more than the
$20 million reserved by the company for resolution of all of its
government contract disputes.
   The Defense Department accounts for 42 percent of Sundstrand's
$1.4 billion in annual sales. Asked how much the suspension may have
cost the company, Vernam said, ``I can't put a price on it. ... But
we're glad to be out from under this thing.''
   The Pentagon suspended Sundstrand from doing any new business
with the federal government on Oct. 19, saying it wasn't satisfied
with the company's response to being caught up in a fraud
investigation overseen by the U.S. attorney in Chicago.
   While the suspension did not affect existing contracts, it
prevented the corporation and six subsidiaries _ Sundstrand Data
Control Inc.; Falk Corp.; Sundstrand Heat Transfer Inc.; Sundstrand
Service Corp.; Sullair Corp., and Signatron Inc. _ from bidding on
or receiving any new contracts.
   At the same time Sundstrand Corp. pleaded guilty to four counts
of defrauding the Defense Department by overbilling on aircraft
parts, its Sundstrand Data Control subsidiary settled a separate
case by agreeing to pay $13 million. That case involved charges the
company had used unallowable costs to inflate its overhead rates.
   The U.S. attorney in Chicago, Anton Valukas, said a federal
investigation had determined that besides overbilling for aircraft
parts, the company had been submitting claims for such things as
babysitting expenses, country clubs and servants for its executives.
   Sundstrand employees gave an estimated $100,000 worth of liquor,
meals, motel rooms, golf outings and tickets to the theater, hockey,
football and baseball games, the government said. They then
submitted expense reports identifying the Defense Department workers
they entertained only as a ``customer'' or ``government employee,''
the complaint said.
   DLA spokesman Wilson said the $62.3 million figure announced
Thursday was based on the results of various audits dealing with how
Sundstrand had allocated production costs to military contracts in
the past.

<HEAD>Report Says Colgate to Rename A Toothpaste It Sells in Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under pressure from several groups,
Colgate-Palmolive Co. plans to rename Darkie, a toothpaste that it
sells in Asia, and redesign its logotype that had shown a minstrel
in blackface, it was reported Friday.
   The New York Times said the company planned to change the name of
the toothpaste to Darlie and make the logotype a portrait of a man
of ambiguous race wearing a silk top hat, tuxedo and bow tie.
   Colgate-Palmolive has faced increasing criticism from
shareholders, religious groups and blacks for promoting racial
stereotypes through its marketing of the toothpaste, the story said.
   Colgate-Palmolive had paid $50 million in 1985 for half-ownership
of the Hong Kong company that manufactures the toothpaste which is a
best-selling brand in several Asian countries, the newspaper said.
   ``It's just plain wrong,'' the newspaper quoted Reuben Mark, the
chairman and chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive, referring to the
toothpaste's name and logotype.
   ``It's just offensive. The morally right thing dictated that we
must change. What we have to do is find a way to change that is the
least damaging to the economic interests of our partners,'' he told
the newspaper.
   The story said the name would be changed in stages over the next
year and the logotype will be replaced the following year. The
gradual switch is designed to reduce confusion and avoid lost sales,
the newspaper said.
   It said that Colgate-Palmolive agreed to pay for the redesign,
repackaging and advertising costs and would reimburse Hawley &amp;
Hazel, the manufacturer that started the toothpaste in the 1920s,
for any lost profits resulting from the change.
   The toothpaste is sold in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan
and Thailand but is not available in the United States, the story
said.

   The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies
in active European trading today as reported central bank
intervention failed to curb bullishness toward the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the central bank intervention was
small, and its effect short-lived. They said the West German central
bank may have sold a substantial amount of dollars early in the day
but most other banks sold token amounts.
   The dollar resumed rising soon after the intervention, and
dealers said they expected the markets to continue to test central
bank resolve.
   ``The arm wrestling match (between the central banks and markets)
will continue and the market seems rather robust,'' said a trader in
Milan.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7685 today, less expensive
for buyers than Thursday's late $1.7730.
   Other mid-morning rates for the dollar compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.8525 West German marks, up from 1.8440;
1.5715 Swiss francs, up from 1.5671; 6.2885 French francs, up from
6.2705; 2.0835 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,352.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,350.25; 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1816.
   Earlier in Tokyo, where the business day ends before London's
begins, the dollar rose to 128.65 Japanese yen, up 1.13 yen. In
London today the dollar traded lower at 128.50 yen.
   Gold bullion prices in London opened at $402.60 a troy ounce,
down from the closing price of $405.75 Thursday. At mid-morning,
London bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price this morning
of $402.05.
   Gold in Zurich was trading at a mid-morning price of $402.20,
down from a late bid price of $405.75 a troy ounce Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $403.99 bid, down from
$407.70.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.07 bid a troy ounce,

   The dollar rebounded sharply in Tokyo today,
reflecting the currency's overnight bullishness in New York and
London, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared to a
new record high close.
   The dollar opened at 128.42 yen and moved between 128.40-128.80
yen before closing at 128.65 yen, up a sharp 1.13 yen from
Thursday's close.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues rebounded 134.32 points, or 0.42 percent, to close
at 31,646.13. It was a record closing figure, surpassing the
previous record set on Wednesday.
   Exchange dealers said the U.S. currency firmed in Tokyo following
its bullish rise in New York overnight and in anticipation of
favorable results in the U.S. gross national product figure.
   ``Many players stepped aside today ahead of the release of the
important economic indicator in the United States,'' said an
exchange dealer at a Japanese commercial bank. ``But a strong
showing in overseas markets encouraged some buying of the dollar.''
   The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to release the December
gross national product figure later today as well as quarterly and
annual figures for 1988.
   In the stock market, dealers said the dollar's upturn encouraged
investors to buy export-related shares such as electronics and
automobiles, notably Sony, Toshiba, and Toyota.
   ``Investors were hesitant to make big investments today before
the U.S. GNP announcement,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage in
Tokyo. ``In general, the market seems still bullish and looking for
incentives to buy shares.''
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most
major shares are listed, was 1.1 billion shares.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange will be open for a half-day trading
session Saturday but will be closed on Saturdays beginning Feb. 4.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Says 1990 Fuel Economy Standard to Stay High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal transportation officials have decided
the 1990 fuel-economy standards should remain at the previous year's
26.5 miles per gallon, says a private auto-safety advocacy group
that wants a higher ceiling.
   The Transportation Department and National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration would neither confirm nor deny Thursday's assertion
by the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety.
   The two agencies administer the corporate average fuel economy,
or CAFE, standards.
   Meanwhile, transportation secretary-designate Samuel Skinner said
he has yet to form a judgment on fuel economy.
   Center Director Clarence Ditlow said he learned of the decison
from sources in the Transportation Department's rule-making office,
the Energy Department, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
   He disclosed the 26.5 mpg figure in a letter asking President
Bush to intervene in favor of a tighter fuel-economy sandard.
   The standard would not be formally set until the agency published
a notice in the Federal Register, the government's record of
official actions.
   Neither the Transportation Department nor its subsidiary agency,
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, would comment on
the assertion.
   The fuel-economy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline
consumption at a time of rapidly rising oil prices and requires
automakers to design the mix of vehicles in their fleets so that the
average meets or betters the fuel-consumption standard.
   The law set a goal of 27.5 mpg beginning in 1985. However, the
law also allowed the government to reduce that if the higher level
would harm automakers or if it was technologically difficult to
attain.
   If transportation officials failed to act, the standard would
revert to 27.5 mpg, a level GM and Ford Motor Co. have said is
impossible for them to meet without layoffs at big-car plants.
   Skinner said at a hearing Thursday before the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee that the administration was committed to
an aggressive environmental program, and that the fuel-economy
standards would be ``a key ingredient'' in that program.
   ``I don't consider myself in a position to have prejudged that
issue at all,'' he said.
   The standard was set at 18 mpg for 1978 cars, rose gradually to
27.5 mpg in 1985, and then was lowered to 26 mpg in 1986 at the
request of some of the automakers. It remained at 26 mpg through the
1988 model year.
   The 26.5 mpg level for 1990 is within the range of 26 mpg to 26.7
mpg GM said it could live with.
   Ford said a 26.5 mpg level would be appropriate but called for
``changes that would bring the fuel-economy law more in line with
today's market and economic conditions.''
   Chrysler did not return calls Thursday but has said previously it
could meet the 27.5 mpg goal set by the law.

   Malaysia plans to send a special
delegation to the United States in March to try to ease concerns
raised by health advocates and competitors against palm oil, one of
its key exports.
   ``We will go and expose all the lies being spread by the American
Soybean Association and others who are doing it because they are
scared that our product is very competitive with their oil and want
to deny the market to us,'' Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng
Yaik said Tuesday at a news conference.
   The delegation of government officials, palm oil producers,
exporters and scientists will present evidence supporting their case
to the National Institute of Oil Processors meeting in Tucson,
Ariz., im said.
   Malaysian exports account for 65 percent of total world palm oil
exports. The industry generates about $2 billion in revenue, and
more than 2 million of Malaysia's 17.5 million people depend
directly or indirectly on it.
   Evidence that highly saturated tropical oils such as palm oil and
coconut oil increase blood cholesterol that causes heart disease has
prompted major campaigns in the United States against using such
fats in processed foods.
   Major food processors such as General Mills Inc., Kellogg Co. and
Pillsbury Co. have responded with announcements that they no longer
use tropical oils in their cookies, crackers and other products.
   Producers of soybean oil, which accounts for about 72 percent of
the U.S. oil market, also have campaigned against tropical oils.
   Malaysia has been doing its own research since the American
Soybean Association, the private National Heart Savers Association
and other groups launched the anti-tropical oils campaign in 1987,
said Li.
   He said he wanted to keep the findings under wraps until March so
that they would have a greater impact on the consumers and others
attending the meeting.
   Other government officials said the findings indicate that palm
oil has many health benefits, contains vitamins and is no more
harmful than other vegetable oils.
   Lim said the palm oil producers here set up a $3.69 million fund
two months ago for a counterattack, which will include
advertisements in national newspapers refuting allegations by the
anti-palm oil forces.
   ``Since they are using scare tactics to drive away food consumers
we have decided to explain the truth directly to the consumers and
tell them palm oil is safe,'' Lim said.
   Lim tried to downplay the importance of the U.S. palm oil market
to Malaysia, noting that the U.S. imported 147,000 tons of Malaysian
palm oil in January-October 1988, down from 157,000 tons in the same
period of 1987. Malaysia's annual production last year reached a
record 5.03 million tons.
   However, Malaysia fears that not challenging the anti-palm oil
campaign in the United States could affect larger markets, such as
India, he said.

<HEAD>Banks Use Lottery To Lure Savers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State bankers are resorting to a lottery to
convince Poles to save their money rather than emptying stores of
what little there is to buy.
   Savers are responding enthusiastically, jamming bank counters to
pledge they will keep 50,000 zlotys _ about a month's salary _ on
deposit for six to nine months in order to be eligible for winning
cash prizes.
   Few seem to care much about the lottery's anti-inflation goal of
``freezing hot money,'' as one banking director put it, or whether
their accounts will bolster the zloty in a beleaguered economy where
almost every meaningful transaction is carried out in another
nation's currency, the U.S. dollar.
   ``Pensions are so low, I could help myself with the money,'' said
one retired office clerk 10th in line at the state PKO bank in
Warsaw.
   They don't seem concerned the zlotys they put into the bank will
have lost value when withdrawn, due to inflation. Instead, they
dream of pocketing the prizes and putting the money toward cars,
apartments or educations abroad.
   The top prize of 50 million zlotys is worth $98,000 at the
official exchange rate or $15,000 at the more relevant black market
price.
   ``It is a good thing for the economy _ let them have it _ and a
good thing for me _ I might win,'' said another retired clerk
waiting at the bank.
   Other than the lottery gimmick, widely promoted on TV and in
newspapers, there are few ways to encourage savings, especially
since the interest paid at banks has lagged behind inflation, which
hit 70 percent to 80 percent last year.
   Although one-year accounts can earn up to 45 percent interest
this year, or up to 22 percent in the accounts covered by the
contest, there is little inclination to deposit when the inflation
rate will devalue money at a conservatively projected 50 percent
this year.
   The government unleashed a flood of zlotys last year when the
printing presses were turned on and salaries raised following two
serious waves of labor unrest. The average monthly salary about
doubled to 60,000 zlotys _ $117 at the official rate or $18 on the
black market.
   Poles took their money to the stores, not the banks.
   ``Ask anybody when he last saw a color TV set, deep freezer or a
vacuum cleaner on store shelves,'' wrote a respected financial
journalist, Piotr Aleksandrowicz, in an article called ``Bulging Pay
Envelopes.''
   In another story, ``Inflation and Savings: A Headache,'' he noted
that Poles are not spendthrifts and in fact save more on average
than Americans.
   ``They invest their savings in gold, hard currency, cars and
household utensils,'' he said. ``The only unprofitable form of
savings are bank deposits.''
   The start of the zloty lottery was delayed because supplies of
the entrance forms did not arrive. But once savers began
registering, long lines were reported at the participating banks
nationwide and the post offices where pledges also are accepted.
   By mid-January, about 100 billion zlotys had been pledged,
representing 10 percent of the funds deposited in the checking and
short-term savings accounts included in the contest, said Marian
Bartkowiak, head of the PKO savings department.
   The rules provide for one prize of 50 million zloty and 10 prizes
of 500,000 zlotys for savers who pledge to keep a minimum of 50,000
zlotys on deposit for nine months. Those who agree to keep the
50,000 zlotys in their accounts for six months are eligible for one
prize of 20 million zlotys and 20 awards of 100,000 zlotys each.
   Participants get a chance at the prizes for each 50,000 zlotys
pledged. One newspaper reported a customer entering 669 times,
investing 33 million zlotys.
   At the PKO branch, a mechanical engineer on a pension was topping
off his account at 50,000 zlotys, which represented his life
savings. Should he win, he said, he would move from the single room
he shares with his wife and a third person.
   ``Once in a life time, I will try,'' he said. ``If I win, I will
try to rent a proper apartment .... Otherwise, I can't afford a
dog's house.''
   A young mother was doing exactly what state economists hoped by
investing money her monther-in-law had saved at home.
   ``Don't we have enough hospitals to give to?'' said another woman
asked what she would do should her account be drawn when the winners
are picked in August and November. ``If it comes for free, one
should give it for free.
   ``There is a lot of hope,'' she said. ``And the more so because
Poland is poor. Should it borrow money from elsewhere?''
   By depositing zlotys in banks, Poles can help the economy by
providing banks with capital to be lent to state enterprises,
private businesses or home builders. Officials would also like to
cool consumer demand, which exceeds the economy's capacity to supply
goods.
   The contest won't return enough money to banks, or keep it there
long enough, to give the zloty firm backing.
   ``I very much doubt whether a `zloty 50,000 lottery' can ever
become a substitute for sound (government policy) approach to
savings,'' wrote Aleksandrowicz.
   Until then, the black market rate by which zlotys are transferred
to dollars _ at the rate of 3,300 zlotys to the dollar, rather than
the government-imposed rate of 510 zlotys to the dollar _ will
remain so much a part of Polish life that the unofficial rate is
published in legal newspapers.

   The world's biggest library hasn't escaped the
growing epidemic of computer viruses, according to a computer
specialist for the Library of Congress.
   Glenn McLoughlin, a staff member with the Science Policy Research
Division of the library's Congressional Research Service, disclosed
Thursday that a virus was spotted and killed out of the main catalog
computer system last fall before it could inflict any damage to data
files.
   ``It was identified before it could spread or permanently erase
any data,'' he told a delegation of Japanese computer specialists
touring this country to assess the virus problem.
   The Library of Congress, with a staff of about 5,000 people,
annually receives more than 1 million books, magazines, newspapers
and other items from around the globe. It has a variety of computer
systems to help handle the massive information base.
   McLoughlin said the virus was found after personnel logging onto
computers at the library noticed they had substantially less
computer memory space to work with than they had expected.
   The virus apparently entered the system through a piece of
software obtained from the University of Maryland, McLoughlin said.
   ``We don't know whether it was a student at Maryland, or whether
Maryland had gotten it from somebody else,'' he said. ``That was
simply the latest point of departure for the software.''
   Viruses are generally small strings of computer code that can be
stealthily inserted into programs, causing various problems
including destruction of data and sudden clogging of a computer's
memory with thousands of copies of the virus.
   Another computer security specialist addressing Thursday's
briefing said the world may be heading toward a catastrophic
computer failure unless more effective measures are taken to combat
viruses.
   Professor Lance J. Hoffman of George Washington University
likened the virus which struck the Pentagon's computer network last
November to a frightening nuclear accident, and said it ``could have
had very disastrous consequences for our society.''
   ``It wasn't Chernobyl yet, it was the Three Mile Island _ it woke
a lot of people up,'' Hoffman said.

   William A. Ott, president and publisher
of the San Jose Mercury News, has died of cancer. He was 61.
   ``He was quintessentially a newspaperman. He loved it,'' said
James K. Batten, president and chief executive officer of
Knight-Ridder Inc., parent company of the Mercury News.
   Ott, who died Thursday, was Knight-Ridder's senior vice president
for operations for nine years before taking charge of the Mercury
News in February 1986.
   In San Jose, he was a highly visible member of the community,
joining a wide variety of local and regional community organizations.
   Ott was an honor graduate of the University of Georgia in 1949
and attended law school at Mercer University in Macon. He served as
a criminal investigation division agent in Korea from 1945 to 1947.
   He got his first newspaper job at 11, delivering papers for the
Moultrie (Ga.) Observer. He became circulation manager for the
newspaper four years later.
   At 23, he became a full-time reporter at the Macon Telegraph &amp;
News in Georgia, where during his 20-year stay he rose to managing
editor and editor.
   Ott moved to the business side of journalism when Knight-Ridder
bought the Macon paper and he moved to the Beacon Journal in Akron,
where he served as publisher from 1975 to 1977.
   Ott was to have become chairman of the San Jose newspaper on
April 1.
   Ott is survived by his wife, Bettie, five sons, two daughters,
eight grandchildren and a sister.
   Funeral services were pending.

<HEAD>Creator Of Sopwith Camel Dead At 101</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith, the
adventure-loving creator of the famed World War I Sopwith Camel and
Pup airplanes, died today, his son said. He was 101.
   Sopwith, who taught himself to fly in 1910 and began designing
airplanes at age 26, died before dawn at his 19th century manor home
near Winchester in southern England, his son Thomas said.
   ``Really he died of old age, but he'd had a marvelous (life),''
said Thomas Sopwith, 56, from his office in Brighton.
   The elder Sopwith, an accomplished race car driver and yachtsman
before he discovered his passion for airplanes, set several early
flying records.
   ``We had a lot of crashes in those days, but, bless you, it was
fun,'' he recalled on his 100th birthday last year. ``This new
experience of flying was one of the most exhilarating things that
had ever happened to me.''
   Sir John Lidbury, a former director of Sopwith's Hawker Siddeley
aircraft company, said: ``He was a wonderful engineer, with great
technical ability and flair ... Everything he put his hand to he did
thoroughly and well.''
   More than 16,000 Sopwith airplanes were built for action in World
War I, including 6,000 Camels, which shot down more enemy aircraft
than any other allied plane. A Camel flown by Roy Brown shot down
the German Baron Von Richthofen, the infamous ``Red Baron.''
   Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, born in 1888 into a wealthy
engineering family, was 16 when the Wright brothers flew under power
for the first time in the United States.
   Sopwith loved all racing, and became involved with motorcycles,
motorboats, ballooning and sailing before taking up flying in 1910.
   He bought his first airplane for 630 pounds (then worth $3,000),
and after two flights as a passenger, he taught himself to fly. His
first solo flight ended in a crash, but he wasn't injured.
   Sopwith founded Sopwith Aviation Co. in 1912 and gave up piloting
for design two years later. His company created the Snipe, the Pup
and the Camel.
   Jack Bruce, an aviation historian, said some pilots grew to love
the Camel, which he called a ``neurotically responsive machine,''
but only after they had spent time with it.
   ``(It was) difficult to learn how to handle but once pilots had
got the hang of it, (it was) quite exceptionally maneuverable,'' he
told the Daily Telegraph last year. ``But a lot of pilots were
petrified at the thought of it.''
   Sopwith's second company, founded between the wars, took the name
of his test pilot Harry Hawker who died in 1921.
   In 1936, Sopwith gambled by building 1,000 of his Hurricane
airplanes without an advance order from the government, but the
plane later became the backbone of the Royal Air Force when World
War II broke out.
   He retired as chairman of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1963.
   Sopwith was married twice, and both his wives are deceased.
   He is survived by his son.

<HEAD>Economy Grew Robust 3.8 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with five grafs to UPDATE with GNP report. Picks up 2nd
graf pvs, On Wall ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a robust 3.8 percent in 1988 _ the best
performance in four years _ as it shook off the effects of the stock
market crash and the summer drought, the government reported today.
   The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure
of economic health, was powered by a big improvement in the U.S.
trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital investment.
   The advance occurred even though growth slowed sharply in the
fourth quarter of the year. From October through December, the GNP
grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2 percent, the slowest quarterly
performance in two years. Weakness in consumer spending and business
investment held back growth.
   The fourth-quarter GNP increase followed a 2.5 percent rise in
the July-September quarter. The 3.8 percent GNP increase for 1988
followed a 3.4 percent rise in 1987 and was the best showing since a
6.8 percent rise in 1984.
   Today's positive economic data came a day after the government
reported that factory orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods surged
in December.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average surged toward
the 2,300 mark for the first time since the October 1987 market
crash. The widely-followed market index rose 25.18 to close at
2,291.07 on Thursday.
   Oil prices tumbled, meanwhile, because of pessimism over OPEC's
ability to control worldwide production.
   Orders for durable goods jumped 6.4 percent in December, the
biggest increase since an 8.7 percent rise last June, the Commerce
Department said. Demand for durable goods, items expected to last
three or more years, were a seasonally adjusted $130.85 billion in
December.
   Demand over the 12 months totaled $1.43 trillion, a 10.8 percent
increase from 1987, when orders had been up 7.6 percent over the
previous year.
   Analysts said the report showed there are no signs of a slowdown
in the economy so far in 1989.
   Economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said
the health of the U.S. manufacturing industry in 1988 showed that,
``at a good price, U.S. goods can hold their own in the world
market.''
   But the prices Americans pay for imported goods resumed an upward
trend in the final three months of 1988 to post a 4.1 percent
increase for the year, the Labor Department said in another report.
   The Labor Department said separately that nearly 1.8 million
workers covered by major collective-bargaining contracts signed in
1988 will receive average annual pay raises of 2.4 percent.
   For the first year of those 415 contracts, covering bargaining
units with 1,000 or more members, the average pay gain is 2.6
percent.
   In London Thursday, ministers from six OPEC nations and seven
independent oil producers agreed to recommend further steps for
bolstering world oil prices but stopped short of making specific
plans for cooperation.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been trying
to enlist the support of non-OPEC producers since the cartel agreed
in November to curtail its own production in order to boost prices.

<HEAD>Stone Container Announces Offer For Consolidated Bathurst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders who have a combined 65 percent stake
in Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. have agreed to tender their stock to
Stone Container Corp., which is making a $2.2 billion bid to buy the
Canadian company.
   Stone Container's offer, which amounts to $25 (Canadian) per
common share, includes approximately 102.4 million common shares of
Consolidated-Bathurst, and approximately 2 million preferred shares,
Stone Container said.
   The $2.2 billion price cited by Stone Container is in U.S.
dollars.
   ``We believe that Consolidated-Bathurst is an outstanding
company, with excellent management and personnel,'' said Roger W.
Stone, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Stone
Container.
   The purchase of one of Canada's leading forest products companies
would convert Stone into a $6 billion concern and make it one of the
world's leading producers of commodity paper and newsprint.
   ``The planned acquisition is totally consistent with our strategy
of commitment to the growth and profitability of our core
business,'' Stone said Thursday.
   Power Corp. of Montreal, which has controlling interest in
Consolidated-Bathurst, said it would tender its shares.
   Power, a holding company run by financier Paul Desmarais, owns 40
percent of Consolidated-Bathurst and controls another 10 percent
through an agreement with the Kuwait Investment Office.
   A third shareholder, Bouverie Investments Ltd., also has agreed
to tender. The three companies together control about 65 percent of
Consolidated-Bathurst shares.
   Stone Container expects to mail the offer and related materials
to all Consolidated-Bathurst shareholders within the next 10 days.
   An acquisition is subject to approval by Investment Canada, a
federal agency that reviews foreign takeovers.
   Stone Container, based in Chicago, is the world's largest
producer of unbleached containerboard and kraft paper, and converts
those products into containers and bags.
   Demarais told a crowded news conference he was disappointed he
did not achieve his goal of building Consolidated-Bathurst into a
worldwide concern, but he added: ``There comes a time to take a
profit.''
   Consolidated-Bathurst reported earnings of $239.6 million for
1988, on sales of $2.4 billion. Stone Container, in the same period,
earned $345 million Cdn on sales of $4.4 billion.

   A heretical idea is making the rounds of Wall
Street these days _ that credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve
and rising interest rates might actually be good for the stock
market.
   To experienced investors, that's a bit like declaring that the
law of gravity has been repealed.
   The suggestion is not only hard to swallow. If it is true, it
throws a lot of other basic financial calculations out of whack.
   There is an abiding logic to the idea that rising interest rates
serve as a brake on future economic activity and that they
simultaneously tend to attract money out of stocks into less risky
interest-bearing investments like Treasury bills.
   But the experience of the past few months in the financial
markets hasn't followed the standard script at all.
   As short-term rates in particular have climbed steadily, stocks
have staged a spirited rally, climbing back above where they stood
on the eve of Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 508 points.
   Among the many explanations that have been offered for this
paradoxical performance, the most commonly advanced one says old
relationships have been distorted by the increasing
internationalization of the markets.
   That has introduced a new variable of increasing importance:
fluctuations in the dollar against other leading currencies.
   ``There is a silver lining to high short-term interest rates,''
said John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``They kept the
dollar firm, even bullish, in the face of a surprisingly poor trade
report'' issued by the Commerce Department on Jan. 18.
   ``That enabled both stocks and bonds to rally.''
   Adds the Merrill Lynch Market Letter in its current issue: ``It's
interesting to note that the dollar and the Dow Jones industrial
average have been following virtually parallel paths since
mid-November.''
   ``Interesting'' might not be the first word chosen by
practitioners of the art known as tactical asset allocation, the
dominant approach to decision-making in the late 1980s among
institutional money managers and the brokerage firms that cater to
them.
   Asset allocation is a system of shifting money under management
among stocks, bonds and short-term interest-bearing securities,
often based on a computer ``model'' that automatically weighs a
variety of influences.
   The typical asset allocation model puts a heavy emphasis on
interest rates.
   ``As short rates go higher and higher, the models allocate less
and less to equities,'' observed Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   ``This has worked more often than not, but we submit that the
decade of the 1980s is at variance with postwar experience.
   ``Many investors have wondered why bond yields don't rise when
the Fed raises short rates.
   ``The reason is that long-term investors are encouraged by a
tough Fed monetary policy because it assures them that inflation
won't erode their historically high rate of return.
   ``In the same way, holders of U.S. currency are encouraged by the
prospect of high short-term interest rates.''
   All this raises a corollary question. If stock-market investors
have learned a way to become comfortable with high and rising
interest rates, how might stocks react when the Fed loosens credit
and short-term rates decline?
   Many analysts argue that such a setting would be ideal for a
powerful rally in the stock market. Others say the optimists can't
have it both ways, benefiting from both rising and falling rates.
   As this debate persists, some suggest, the answer may well be
provided by currency traders and how they treat the dollar if and
when interest rates do start to fall.

   Experts from six OPEC members and seven independent
oil-producing nations have taken a step toward joint action to
support oil prices, but the move failed to inspire the oil markets.
   After a day-long meeting Thursday in London, the participants
said they agreed to share responsiblity for ensuring market
stability and that the non-OPEC countries supported OPEC's target
price of $18 a barrel.
   But no specific actions, such as production cuts, were announced.
   Oil prices fell immediately on the news, but then recovered
somewhat on Friday.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, stood at $16.27 a barrel Friday afternoon,
up 2 cents from late Thursday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ was up 9
cents in early trading today after falling 40 cents on Thursday to
settle at $17.72 a barrel.
   ``It was a satisfactory first step, but we must keep the momentum
going,'' Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
Secretary-General Subroto said in an interview. ``The atmosphere at
the meeting was very, very encouraging.''
   The non-OPEC producers told the OPEC members that they had agreed
on a set of actions but that they wished to advise their own
ministers before revealing them to OPEC, said Subroto, who chaired
the meeting of experts.
   High-level OPEC sources said the non-OPEC group mentioned the
idea of a ceiling on their combined output.
   The non-OPEC producers didn't ask for anything from OPEC in
return, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Cutting production by 5 percent ``is an option,'' Subroto said,
without elaborating.
   Non-OPEC sources had said this week that independent producers
might offer to cut their production unilaterally by that amount.
   This was the second joint meeting of the two sides. The closed
gathering also was attended by observers from an additional six
independent oil producers.
   When they met for the first time in April, non-OPEC producers
suggested the two sides jointly cut production by 5 percent. OPEC
refused, however.
   OPEC members have expressed resentment that they curb their own
production to boost oil prices, from which the independent
countries, producing what they like, benefit unfairly.
   ``At the moment, it looks like it's nothing concrete so it's not
the most bullish outcome one could have expected,'' said Philip
Morgan, an oil analyst with the London investment firm Citicorp
Scrimgeour Vickers. ``Even so, I think it's a positive step and if
cuts are going to be forthcoming in the second quarter, then this
should protect prices from sliding.''
   But Paul McDonald, a London-based independent oil analyst, said,
``Yea, but what have they done? They've just said they're in favor
of higher oil prices.''
   He described the outcome as ``OPEC and non-OPEC hot air'' which
he said was designed to manipulate the oil market into taking prices
higher.
   The two sides issued a joint communique which said: ``The
independent oil producers supported the OPEC objective of reaching a
price of $18 a barrel ... as soon as possible and both sides agreed
on the joint responsibility to ensure market stability ....''
   ``They agreed on the need to take further steps to enhance
improvements already achieved and to further strengthen the oil
market, especially in the second quarter of 1989.'
   The communique added that ``the independent producers agreed to
recommend to their appropriate authorities the necessary cooperative
measures to contribute to market stability in the coming months.''
   The statement didn't specify any measures.
   Oil ministers from both sides are expected to hold a meeting
together at a yet-to-be decided date, Subroto said.
   The particpating OPEC members were Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria.
   The 13-member cartel's other members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya,
Qatar, Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.
   The non-OPEC group consisted of representatives of Angola, China,
Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and Oman and observers from the
Soviet Union, Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic and the Canadian
province of Alberta and the U.S. states of Alaska and Texas.
   OPEC members agreed in November to limit their production to 18.5
million barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to a targeted $18
a barrel. The agreement was effective Jan. 1.
   OPEC members are producing an estimated 19.5 million barrels a
day, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourth
quarter. That has helped oil prices recover from around $12 a barrel
in December.

   The president and chief operating officer
of Gtech Corp., Deward F. Manzer, resigned from the lottery
equipment and services company without explanation today.
   Manzer, 49, had been president since December 1987. The
announcement said only that he had resigned ``to pursue other
professional interests.''
   Neither Manzer nor Guy B. Snowden, Gtech chairman and chief
executive, returned telephone calls to the Associated Press.
   The announcement said Snowden would assume Manzer's
responsibilities, but it was not clear if he also would assume the
title of president.
   The resignation apparently was discussed at a board meeting
Thursday, but no other details were immediately available.
   Gtech, which had gone through several quarters of shrinking
profits and rising stockholder complaints during Manzer's tenure,
recently reported its most profitable quarter in two years, earning
$2.69 million, of 28 cents per share, on revenue of $43.7 million
for the third quarter ended Nov. 26.
   Earnings for the same quarter in 1987 were $2.51 million, or 26
cents per share.

<HEAD>Government Sought to Bargain With Milken, Sources Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors offered a
plea-bargain deal to Drexel Burnham Lambert's senior junk-bond
trader Michael Milken two weeks ago but his lawyers rejected it
immediately and vowed to fight them in court, sources familiar with
the discussions said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
Milken's defense team did not initiate the meeting with Manhattan
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's office.
   But the contact marked the first time both sides have discussed a
possible bargain since Drexel and Milken were embroiled in the Wall
Street corruption scandal in late 1986 by now-imprisoned speculator
Ivan F. Boesky.
   Milken, head of Drexel's high-yield ``junk bond'' trading desk in
Beverly Hills, Calif., is one of the most dynamic and wealthy
financiers in the country. He is largely credited with vaulting
Drexel into a securities superpower.
   Drexel capitulated to prosecutors last month and agreed to plead
guilty to six felonies, pay $650 million in fines, fire Milken and
cooperate in the government's case against him.
   The 42-year-old financier is facing as-yet unfiled fraud and
racketeering charges that carry enormous prison terms and financial
penalties.
   ``The U.S. attorney's office requested a meeting,'' one of the
sources familiar with the recent contact said. ``Milken's attorneys
went to the meeting. The U.S. attorney made a proposal and it was
rejected.''
   Aides to Giuliani said they could not comment on whether such a
meeting took place. But it is not uncommon for targets of
racketeering indictments to discuss possible settlement discussions
before the charges are filed.
   Milken spokesman Kenneth Lerer also declined to comment on the
meeting but said in a statement: ``There are no discussions going on
between the U.S. attorney's office and Mike Milken's attorneys, no
discussions whatsoever.
   ``For the past 27 months, Mike's position has remained unchanged.
He will vigorously fight any charges brought against him and his
lawyers are preparing his defense.''
   It was unclear what Giuliani offered Milken to induce him to
settle. He has maintained he did nothing wrong, and a turnaround at
this point would mark a stunning reversal by a major target in what
has become the biggest securities fraud case in history.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting unidentified sources, reported
today that prosecutors said Milken would have to plead guilty to two
felonies with a maximum five-year penalty for each count.
   But the paper said the deal didn't include immunity for Milken's
brother Lowell, another senior Drexel aide who also is facing
probable indictment. Milken's associates said Thursday it was
unlikely he would strike a plea bargain, despite the enormous
pressure he is facing to change his mind.
   Court papers revealed Wednesday that terms of the settlement
require Drexel to dismiss Milken and withhold the 1988 compensation
due him, estimated at $200 million. His lawyers said the terms
amount to an outrageous, disgraceful and illegal punishment, which
they indicated would be challenged in court.
   For Milken, the crisis he's facing represents far more than loss
of a job. With a personal wealth estimated by Forbes magazine at
$800 million and an undisputed knack for making money, he can
survive the loss financially.
   But the accusations against him have cast a cloud over a
remarkable career that revolves around his virtually single-handed
creation of the market in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
   They also have brought attention and sympathy from the many who
know Milken as a devoted family man, attentive friend and donor of
millions of dollars to charity.
   Their portrayal stands in sharp contrast to the portrayal of
Milken by government investigators as a scheming, manipulative,
arrogant and greedy trader who colluded with Boesky to violate a
range of securities laws.
   ``My sense of things is this is a man who thinks he has done
nothing to blacken his family's name _ and that's important to him.
He's very resolute,'' said Jesse Kornbluth, a Vanity Fair writer who
spent many hours with Milken last summer while preparing an article
and still chats with him frequently by telephone.
   ``I expect him to fight it,'' said Clark Johnson, president and
chief executive officer of Pier 1 Imports, which has financed
expansion with the help of Milken and Drexel.
   Drexel is expected to survive the loss of Milken, who with his
junk bond traders transformed the firm from an insignificant
brokerage house to a powerful force on Wall Street. Milken, once the
prime mover in the junk bond market, is no longer indispensable,
analysts said.

   The stock market surged ahead today, carrying its
early-1989 rally to new highs amid signs of slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 30.89 to 2,321.96
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 82.99 million shares at
midmorning.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that
the gross national product grew at a annual rate of 2 percent, after
adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street,
and provided a fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy
was slowing to a sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace.
   Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term
government bonds by about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock
prices that has already been gathering steam of late.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.29 to 164.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .83 at 322.25.

   The threat of prison and other penalties
encouraged at least 30 suspects to cooperate with federal agents in
their massive investigation of alleged fraud at two major futures
exchanges, a newspaper reported today.
   Traders and brokers who agreed to cooperate are expected to name
alleged co-conspirators and broaden the potential targets of the
two-year investigation, the Chicago Tribune reported.
   ``No one wants to be left holding the bag,'' the newspaper quoted
an unidentified source as saying.
   Subpoenas to appear before a grand jury have been served on more
than 200 prominent brokers, traders and trading firms associated
with the Chicago Board of Trade and at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   One defense attorney told the Tribune that his client offered to
provide the FBI with evidence that 20 associates cheated customers
on their trades at the exchanges.
   Prosecutors and the FBI repeatedly have refused to comment on the
investigation.
   The suspects who are cooperating, believed to number at least 30,
could escape racketeering charges in exchange for guilty pleas to
lesser offenses, the newspaper reported. A racketeering conviction
could result in the federal government confiscating a trader's seat
on the exchange and other assets. Exchange seats can be worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   In addition to the brokers and traders, the futures industry
itself is under scrutiny, although federal regulators caution
against any hasty reforms.
   ``The best way to make mistakes is to try to fix something before
you know what's wrong,'' Kate Hathaway, spokeswoman for the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said Thursday.
   The CFTC, the independent federal agency established to regulate
the commodities markets, has come under criticism by traders and
others following disclosure last week of the investigation in which
undercover FBI agents posed as traders, secretly recording floor
conversations.
   Some knowledgable observers say the investigation is likely to
result in restrictions on some kinds of trading, closer monitoring
of traders and a more precise audit trail. They also suggest the
CFTC has been lax in preventing abuses and catching violators from
the outset.
   ``I don't think it (the investigation) calls the system into
question as much as it does the controls on the system,'' said Fred
White, who once worked for the CFTC and is now an attorney
representing trading firms.
   ``It should not have been the U.S. attorney's office,'' White
said. ``It clearly should have been the CFTC.''
   In response, Ms. Hathaway said, ``We have been involved from the
beginning of this investigation ... and I'm really nonplussed.''
   ``I don't see that there's any reason that this should be
translated into criticism of the CFTC,'' she added.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday appointed a panel of
industry and non-industry representatives to review all transaction
rules there and recommend revisions and improvements. Officials of
the Chicago Board of Trade have announced no plans for a review.
   The Merc's review echoes similar self-examinations that the
futures exchanges undertook following the October 1987 stock market
collapse, when critics blamed stock-index futures trading for market
volatility that may have worsened the crash.
   Then, the Merc and Chicago Board of Trade produced reports and
figures aimed at showing their markets were blameless. They
contended that futures selling actually provided an outlet that
prevented the crash from getting worse.
   At the time, the self-reviews by the futures exchanges and
similar examinations by the stock markets were widely seen as
attempts to clean their own houses and forestall more government
regulation.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported today that FBI agents caught
traders and brokers shouting and signaling wildly as they faked
hundreds of floor trades that had been secretly rigged ahead of
time. The newspaper said federal sources, whom it did not name, said
the prearranged trades at rigged prices were used to cheat investors
out of millions of dollars.
   ``There's a lot of shouting and screaming that goes on out on the
exchange floors. But that shouting and screaming is a cover-up for a
lot of cheating,'' said one trader, who asked not to be identified.
   The Merc got a boost Thursday, however, when members of the New
York Mercantile Exchange voted to join Globex, the Merc's
computerized trading system.
   ``Obviously, it's got to be a shot in the arm,'' said a spokesman
for the Merc.
   Globex is a project of the Merc and Reuters of America Inc. It is
scheduled for a trial run this summer.

<HEAD>Toyota Considering Major Production Facility In Britain</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, is
studying the possibility of building a factory in Britain to produce
passenger cars by 1992, Toyota President Shoichiro Toyoda said
Friday.
   ``Toyota has been considering European car production for some
time,'' Toyoda said at a news conference. ``We are starting in-depth
feasibility studies with Britain as a strong candidate for a site
for our car production in Europe. It does not mean we have made a
final decision.''
   The study will examine plans for production of 1,800-cubic
centimeter cars at the rate of 200,000 per year, Toyoda said. The
factory would employ about 3,000 workers and represent an investment
of 140 billion yen, or about $1.1 billion, he said.
   Toyota Executive Vice President Tsutomu Ohshima said the company
``will consider the option in Britain first, before others we
have.'' He described the feasibility study as ``an assessment to
make it (production in Europe) possible, not just to see our chance
with the project.''
   Toyota, ranked third in worldwide auto production after General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., would be the second Japanese
automaker to produce cars on its own in Britain after Nissan Motor
Co., which started production in 1986. Honda Motor Co. sells Hondas
in Britain manufactured by the Austin Rover Group.
   Toyota reportedly also has been examining the possibility of
setting up operations in Belgium, Portugal or Spain. Asked why the
firm was focusing on Britain, Toyoda said, ``Britain is a leading
member of the European Economic Community and the government has
shown us that we would be welcome.''
   In London, British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Lord
Young said in a statement, ``I have made it clear to Toyota that
they would receive a warm welcome from the government if they were
to decide to locate the project in the U.K., and I have invited them
to work closely with my department in pursuing their feasibility
studies.''
   The automaker has not discussed tax breaks or other incentives
with the British government, Managing Director Juji Numata told
reporters.
   Toyota's announcment ``is not unexpected and is consistent with
the existing trend of all Japanese automakers,'' said an auto
industry analyst at a major securities firm.
   ``Toyota is notable by its absence (from the EEC),'' said the
analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Toyota has been the
most laggard, but it certainly has the capability, with 2 trillion
yen, or $15.5 billion, in cash assets at its disposal.''
   Toyota's announcement comes amid concern in Japan over the
creation of the 12-nation European Economic Community's single
market in 1992.
   The single market aims through harmonization of tax laws and
other measures to establish a free flow of goods among EEC nations.
Many imports from non-EEC countries, including Japan, are expected
to be subject to new EEC restrictions from 1992.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy shook off the effects of the
stock market crash and the drought to grow at a robust 3.8 percent
in 1988, the best performance in four years, the government reported
today.
   The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure
of economic health, was powered by a big improvement in the U.S.
trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital investment.
   The advance occurred even though growth slowed sharply in the
final three months of the year. From October through December, the
GNP grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2 percent, the slowest
quarterly performance in two years. Weakness in consumer spending
and business investment held back growth.
   The fourth-quarter GNP increase followed a 2.5 percent rise in
the July-September quarter.
   Many economists predict these trends will intensify this year and
will result in sharply lower growth for 1989. That would give
President Bush a major headache because his hopes of lowering the
budget deficit without an increase in taxes rests on expectations of
continued strong economic growth.
   But Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner, briefing reporters
about the GNP report, said he believed the growth forecasts used in
the Reagan administration budget were realistic. He said some of the
sluggishness in the fourth quarter was based on temporary factors
that would not last into the new year.
   Ortner said there were several positive economic developments
during 1988.
   ``We made significant progress in reducing the trade defict, the
unemployment rate dropped to a 14-year low and the stock market
began a sustained recovery from its plunge in late 1987,'' he said.
   The 3.8 percent GNP increase for 1988 followed a 3.4 percent rise
in 1987 and was the best showing since a 6.8 percent rise in 1984.
   Higher inflation accompanied the increase in growth. An inflation
index tied to the GNP rose by 4.2 percent in 1988, the fastest rise
in prices since 1982.
   The jump in inflation, up from a 1987 price increase of 3.6
percent, has set off alarm bells at the Federal Reserve Board, which
has been driving interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demand
and keep inflationary pressures in check.
   Bush complained this week that the Fed should not grow so
concerned about fighting inflation that it risks slowing economic
growth, but many analysts believe the board's inflation-fighting
efforts will continue and push interest rates even higher.
   The 3.8 percent GNP increase in 1988 was a far cry from what many
analysts had forecast when the year began. The most pessimistic of
them had predicted the economy would be in a recession before year's
end, brought on by a cutback in consumer spending as a result of
fears triggered by the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Instead, consumers kept right on spending, with personal
consumption purchases rising by 2.8 percent during the whole year.
   Almost half of all growth in 1988 came from two related factors _
a big improvement in the country's trading performance and the
biggest rise in business investment spending since 1984.
   For the year, U.S. exports sales rose a sharp 17.7 percent,
offsetting an 8.3 percent increase in imports as the weaker dollar
made American-made goods competitive on overseas markets.
   Responding to this increased demand, American businesses boosted
spending on new plants and equipment by 9.5 percent, a sharp
acceleration from a 2.8 percent rise the previous year.
   However, in the fourth quarter the trade deficit began rising
again and business investment actually fell. While analysts are
looking for small improvements in both areas this year, they say
growth there will not come anywhere near matching the 1988
performance.
   For that reason, many economists are predicting that 1989 GNP
growth will be much slower than the 3.8 percent increase in 1988.
   The Reagan administration based its fiscal 1990 budget forecast
on an estimate that the GNP would grow 3.2 percent in the current
year. Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, has said the new
administration will accept that economic forecast when Bush submits
his own budget on Feb. 9.
   However, private economists believe that growth in 1989 will rise
by only 2.7 percent, more than a percentage point lower than the
1988 level.
   This slowdown will occur despite the fact that the drought will
no longer be depressing growth as it did in 1988, when it shaved 0.4
percentage point from overall growth. Without the drought, the GNP
would have risen by 4.2 percent in 1988.
   The various changes left the GNP at $3.995 trillion for all of
1988 after removing the effcts of inflation.

   Futures prices of grains and soybeans were mostly
lower in early trading today at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Bearish weather forecasts in South America and across the U.S.
winter wheat belt pressured prices, and further selling occurred as
traders took profits after Thursday's big rally, analysts said.
   A strong dollar also discouraged buying in grain and soybeans,
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   A forecast for more soybean-enhancing rain in Brazil kept the lid
on bean prices, he said, and recent gains in wheat due to dry
weather in U.S. growing regions evaporated as forecasters predicted
rain tonight and Saturday.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.41\ a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.71\; oats were 1{ cents to
3\ cents lower with March at $2.16}; and soybeans 3 cents lower to
1} cents higher, with March at $7.58{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures prices advanced and hogs opened mostly higher
today at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .28 cent to .72 cent higher,
with the contract for delivery in February at 72.70 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .25 cent to .95 cent higher, with March at 82.70
cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher,
with February at 42.55 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
.03 cent to .13 cent higher, with February at 38.85 cents a pound.
   Pork futures fell sharply and cattle traded mostly lower on
Thursday.

   The drive by the Farmers Home Administration to
collect more than $8 billion in long-overdue accounts is running
into administrative snarls that some critics say will be impossible
to untangle soon.
   Delinquent farm borrowers were given 45 days to respond to
collection notices sent in late November. Farmers had to fill out
long forms and return them to FmHA to qualify for loan servicing.
   If the forms were not returned on time, borrowers were told they
could face foreclosure or forced sale to take care of the debts.
   Neal Sox Johnson, acting administrator of the Agriculture
Department agency, told the Senate Agriculture Committee's
subcommittee on agricultural credit last week that the agency's
latest tabulation showed that 70,747 notices were sent out by
certified mail by FmHA county offices Nov. 15-25.
   A total of 34,719, or less than half, were returned with requests
for loan servicing under the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, which
provides a number of options, including a write-down of debt.
   Johnson told the panel, headed by Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., that
it had not determined why the others were not returned. But he said
the 36,028 who did not reply would be notified again by regular mail
and given a 45-day period in which to respond.
   ``We are at the point where our field staff must analyze those
applications that have been received so that those borrowers can
receive a decision within 60 days as set forth in the statute,''
Johnson said. ``I am sure you understand the complex nature of many
of these individual cases, especially those that have been in a
questionable status for a considerable period of time.''
   Johnson said FmHA was aware that ``farmers need those decisions
promptly in order to make plans for the coming crop year. He also
noted that FmHA has 183,000 other borrowers who are not delinquent
and that those will require attention for spring planting.
   Leland H. Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, told
Boren's subcommittee he doubted that FmHA would be able to process
the workload within 60 days as required by law and still work out
the best deal for the borrower, lender and the taxpayer.
   ``It is inconceivable to us how, with all the (restructuring)
applications coming in at roughly the same time, agency employees
can be expected to meet their deadlines and still provide the kind
of interactive, negotiated process that Congress envisioned and seek
out the least-cost alternative for resolving a debt problem,'' he
said.
   Swenson added: ``It reminds me of trying to put 10 gallons of
manure in a five-gallon pail.''
   FmHA's Johnson said he would send loan specialists from the
agency's national headquarters to state offices to hold
``on-the-spot reviews and consultation'' on carrying out the law's
provisions for restructuring.
   ``All of us at Farmers Home are committed to working closely with
our borrowers in carrying out the mandates of the (law) in an
efficient and compassionate manner,'' Johnson said. ``Our efforts
are, and will be, directed toward keeping our borrowers on the farm
to the fullest extent possible.''
   Boren, the subcommittee chairman, said the FmHA had not followed
the intent of the Senate in administering the 1987 law and chided
Johnson for the number of forms the agency required farmers to fill
out.
   ``The law says you (farmers) have to sign a letter'' within a
45-day period, not fill out several forms, Boren said. He said he
would ask Clayton Yeutter, agriculture secretary-designate, to give
higher priority to solving FmHA's problems.

   The stock market rolled up another big gain
today, carrying its early-1989 rally to new highs amid signs of
slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 35.00 points to
2,326.07 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 823 up, 401
down and 490 unchanged.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that
the gross national product grew at a annual rate of 2 percent, after
adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street,
and provided a fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy
was slowing to a sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace.
   Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term
government bonds by about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock
prices that has already been gathering steam of late.
   Among actively traded blue chips, DuPont rose | to 100|; Ford
Motor } to 52]; International Business Machines 1 to 127, and
General Electric 1[ to 48.
   Apple Computer tumbled 3{ to 38\ as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company said earnings for its second
fiscal quarter ending March 30 are expected to fall to the range of
35 to 45 cents a share from 61 cents a share in the comparable
period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.46 to 165.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.08 at 322.50.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.91 million shares at
noontime, up from 90.86 million at the same point Thursday.

   President Bush sought today to reassure nervous
savings and loan customers about the safety of their deposits, but
he said the idea of a deposit insurance fee to help solve the crisis
remains under consideration.
   ``The savings and loans deposits are backed by the full faith and
credit of the government and they are sound, they are good,'' Bush
told reporters at his first White House news conference. ``I want to
assure the American people of that and that's not going to change.''
   Bush said he has made no decision concerning the Treasury
Department's suggestion that one way to raise money for the
government insurance fund backing S&amp;L deposits would be a fee of
about 25 cents on every $100 in federally insured S&amp;L, bank and
credit union accounts.
   ``There seems to be some controversy around it (the deposit fee
option), but that doesn't mean that any thinking along those lines
should cease,'' the president said.
   Bush brushed off the question of whether the fee would violate
his ``no new taxes'' pledge, saying, ``I've been around for a long
time. I don't remember hearing people talk about the fee that went
into the FDIC or FSLIC (insurance funds) as a tax.''
   Meanwhile, the top federal S&amp;L regulator said some nervous
customers are withdrawing money from savings and loans because of
the deposit fee trial balloon.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said
in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press that ``there is
nervousness'' based on a misunderstanding of what has been discussed.
   ``We've had problems since yesterday (Wednesday),'' Wall said.
``There have been cases where they say, `I don't like what I heard
on TV, I'm taking my money out.'''
   No S&amp;Ls are in trouble as a result of depositors' reaction, he
said, but ``I'm concerned that people don't cause themselves losses
by cashing in a CD (certificate of deposit) early'' and thus
incurring penalties.
   Wall stressed that the administration is only examining the
deposit fee option at this stage, not proposing one, and the fee
would apply to all federally insured institutions, including banks
and credit unions.
   Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said the agency surveyed S&amp;Ls
Thursday night and found ``no outflows of any significance that we
can attribute to anything that's been said.''
   He said the bank board's chief worry is ``not concern about
what's been happening. It's concern about what might happen.''
   Hoyle said the bank board is trying to emphasize to worried
depositors that the debate within Congress and the administration is
not about whether additional money should be spent to protect
deposits, but about how it should be raised.
   Earlier, in testimony before the House Budget Committee, Wall
said only that ``there are clearly better ideas'' for raising money
than a deposit fee. He said if one were imposed it should be broadly
based, applying also to money market mutual funds offered by
brokerage firms.
   On a related topic, Wall said today that some accountants have
admitted involving themselves improperly with management of savings
and loan institutions they were auditing to declare them financially
healthy.
   Wall, speaking on NBC's ``Today'' show, said in some cases,
auditors simply did not do a good enough job in seeking to determine
if a particular institution was financially healthy.
   However, he said, ``In some cases it is clearly individuals who
happen to be employees of some of the (accounting) firms ... who
were involved in these undertakings with the management of the
institution, all of them setting out to do wrong.''
   ``... We have had some settlements in terms of the allegations
where people have admitted to involvement,'' he said.
   In his congressional testimony Thursday, Wall said the bank board
was suing accounting firms, including three of the so-called ``Big
Eight'' firms, for failing to uncover losses and abuses in S&amp;Ls that
later failed.
   He did not identify the three firms, but bank board spokesman
William Fulwider said the FSLIC has sued two: Deloitte, Haskins and
Sells, and Touche Ross and Co. The insurance fund got jurisdiction
over a third suit against Coopers &amp; Lybrand after taking over the
insolvent S&amp;L that filed it.
   Thomas Kelley of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, insisted in a ``Today'' interview: ``The accounting
profession is not responsible for the savings and loan crisis. ...
Auditors don't give clean bills of health. Secondly, what they do is
report on the fairness of the financial statements.''
   On a related topic, Wall is taking issue with the General
Accounting Office, which told the budget committee that savings and
loan regulators are heading for a cash crunch.
   The GAO, an auditing and investigative agency for Congress, said
the government insurance fund for S&amp;Ls ``has made financial
commitments that on a preliminary basis appear to exceed by about
$26 billion its expected cash flows over the next 10 years.''
   Wall said in the interview with the AP, ``We have not exceeded
our cash flow,'' but acknowledged that the insurance fund could very
soon be overcommitted if regulators continued their current pace of
closing and merging insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   He said the bank board spent or promised to spend $38 billion
last year to ``resolve'' the cases of 205 S&amp;Ls and temporarily
``stabilize'' 18 others. About 350 other insolvent institutions
remain open. It will cost about $35 billion to close them, the GAO
estimates.
   Wall, while maintaining his agency was not overcommitted, said
that unless Congress acts quickly to earmark more money toward the
crisis, his agency may have to leave hundreds of insolvent
institutions open.

   President Bush today said he could suppport an
increased minimum wage but only if Congress also established a
sub-minimum training wage he said would prevent a loss of jobs.
   ``I've always said that my position on minimum wage is that I
would want it linked to a training wage, to a differential of sorts,
so that you don't throw people out of work by raising the minimum
wage,'' Bush said at a White House news conference.
   Bush said he had a ``certain flexibility'' on the question and
would await the recommendations of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
At no point did he say outright that he supported raising the
minumum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981.
   The president's comments came a day after Mrs. Dole told the
Senate Labor Committee that Bush's support of legislation to raise
the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a
training wage in the legislation.
   Bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the Labor
Committee, Edward M. Kennedy, who said Thursday he remained opposed
to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum
hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year.
   Bush during the presidential campaign said in one interview that
he supported some increase in the minimum wage, provided it was
coupled with the training wage, although at other times his campaign
said Bush was against an increase.
   Mrs. Dole, sworn in to her Cabinet post four hours before the
hearing, was not specific as to how high Bush favors raising the
minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage.
Employers would be limited as to the length of time they could pay
the training wage to a new worker.
   ``We have really not at this point had an opportunity to work
through the legislative agenda so I do want an opportunity to go
through this before I get into any great detail of what he is
willing to support,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   ``We're going to get it raised this year for sure,'' Kennedy,
D-Mass., said at the hearing, which he called to assess the impact
of projected labor shortages and the prospect of averting them by
training welfare recipients and lower-income workers for high-skills
jobs.
   Mrs. Dole said she could help erase the so-called ``skills gap''
in the American labor force by working to better coordinate the
numerous job-training programs of government agencies and placing an
emphasis on training the poor and unemployed.
   ``Minorities, the disadvantaged, persons with disabilities and
other groups traditionally left behind will be in demand by
employers as never before, but only if they are qualified,'' Mrs.
Dole said.
   In a brief interview after the hearing, Kennedy, who introduced
his minimum wage bill Wednesday, said ``my views haven't changed''
and that he would try to get the bill through the Senate without a
provision for a training wage.
   Organized labor supports the increased minimum wage but opposes
the training wage, in part because it believes some employers would
use the lower wage to cut their costs by hiring people at the
training wage and laying off higher-paid workers. Mrs. Dole said she
would support adding language to the legislation to prevent that.
   Kennedy's bill would raise the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour,
its level since 1981, to $4.55 in three annual increases of 40 cents
an hour. The wage then would be indexed to 50 percent of the hourly
average income for U.S. workers. A similar bill has been introduced
in the House.

   Britain's merchandise deficit narrowed more sharply
than expected to 1.66 billion pounds, or $2.94 billion, in December,
the government said Friday, providing further evidence that the
country's overheated economy is slowing down.
   The news eased fears that British interest rates would be pushed
higher. The pound surprisingly rallied to $1.7688 following the
11:30 a.m. report, but finished the day lower at $1.7655, down from
$1.7730 late Thursday.
   Stock prices surged, and the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index rose 46.1 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at
2,005.9.
   Despite the December improvement, Britain's trade deficit for the
year more than doubled to 20.34 billion pounds, or $36 billion, and
the country's trade picture was much worse than the Conservative
government's Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has forecast.
   The 1988 deficit was attacked by opposition Labor member of
Parliament Bryan Gould, who serves as his party's trade spokesman:
``These figures complete the worst year in our trading history. They
also show that any prospect of improvement in 1989 looks very
remote.''
   John Smith, who serves as the Labor party's spokesman on Treasury
matters, called the deficit the ``awful legacy'' of last year's
tax-cutting budget. He said it was being made worse by Lawson's
reliance on interest rates to head off inflationary pressure.
   The December narrowing came as exports rose 3 percent and imports
held steady, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   The financial markets had been expecting a deficit of 1.49
billion pounds (?2.64 billion).
   The narrowing indicates a slowdown in economic growth and should
help to reduce the pressure on the government to signal the
commercial banks to raise their base lending rates from their
current 13 percent level, said Ian Harwood, a British economist at
the London investment firm Warburg Securities.
   The news should prove more bearish for the pound in the longer
run, Harwood said.
   ``This (pound rally) is just a knee-jerk reaction,'' he said.
   ``People are going to be increasingly saying that 13 percent is
the peak'' for base rates, he said.
   The seasonally adjusted deficit for December compared with a
revised deficit of 1.87 billion pounds in November and a deficit of
1.24 billion pounds in December 1987, the department said.
   With December's invisible trade, which covers services, overseas
investment earnings and official transfer payments, estimated to be
in surplus by 400 million pounds, Britain's current account showed a
deficit of 1.26 billion pounds in December, compared with a revised
deficit of 1.47 billion pounds in November and a deficit of 802
million pounds in December 1987.
   The markets had expected the current account deficit to come to
between 1.1 billion pounds and 1.8 billion pounds.
   Exports totaled 7.12 billion pounds in December, up from 6.91
billion pounds in November.
   Imports totaled 8.78 billion pounds in December, little changed
from 8.77 billion pounds in November.
   Britain's 1988 merchandise trade deficit of 20.34 billion pounds
compared with a deficit of 10.16 billion pounds in 1987.
   The 1988 current account was 14.27 billion pounds, compared with
a deficit of 2.69 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The 1988 current account deficit was well above Lawson's forecast
of 13 billion pounds.

   The government's $8.5 billion program to clean
up hundreds of the nation's worst toxic waste dumps is coming under
renewed criticism in Congress for missing deadlines and being too
lenient with polluters.
   Two separate reports released by members of Congress took the
Environmental Protection Agency to task Thursday for its management
of the Superfund program, which earmarks hundreds of millions of
dollars a year for waste cleanup.
   EPA officials blamed budget cuts imposed by Congress for part of
the agency's problems in meeting some of the deadlines cited
Thursday. Reacting to a number of critical reports on Superfund,
Congress last year cut its budget by $175 million. It is also
threatening to cut funding this year.
   ``Superfund is simply not working as Congress intended,'' said
Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich., chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee that oversees the EPA's budget.
   ``Instead of a strong enforcement program forcing responsible
parties to undertake their own cleanups, Superfund has taken on a
`public works' flavor with EPA relying primarily on national
contractors paid with trust fund dollars,'' he continued.
   The EPA is supposed to have started an actual cleanup of 175
sites by next October, but likely will begin no more than 160 partly
because of the budget reduction, said Winston Porter, the EPA
assistant administrator in charge of the Superfund program.
   According to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, 41 of the 87 congressionally imposed deadlines that
relate to Superfund have not been met or are not likley to be met.
Forty of those deadlines apply to the EPA while the others apply to
other federal or state agencies.
   A GAO report, released Thursday by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
suggested that in some cases the delays may be ``placing human
health in jeopardy through needlessly prolonged exposure to
hazardous substances.''
   Porter acknowledged that many of the deadlines have been missed,
but insisted that the agency is meeting ``essentially all the major
ones'' including most of those that deal directly with site cleanup
work.
   He called suggestions that the delays are posing health risks as
``total nonsense.''
   A study by Traxler's subcommittee questioned whether the
Superfund program can succeed without ``fundamental changes in
management philosophy and approach.''
   The appropriations subcommittee found that EPA has:
   _ Failed to press private companies to clean up waste dumps,
turning instead to private contractors who are paid directly from
the federal trust fund, which is financed largely by a tax on the
chemical industry.
   _ Not aggressively sought to recover cleanup costs from private
companies.
   _ Tended to ``study sites endlessly'' leading to a ``paralysis by
analysis'' and delaying cleanup programs.
   _ Failed to develop new, cost-effective cleanup technologies that
would permanently treat wastes.
   ``Instead of just pushing waste from one site to another, we need
to develop technologies for permanent treatment,'' said Rep. Bill
Green of New York, the subcommittee's ranking Republican.
   The Superfund, established in the early 1980s, initially
authorized $1.6 billion over four years and was later reauthorized
with an additional $8.5 billion over five years, although $175
million was cut last year.
   The EPA has earmarked about 1,200 sites that the agency says will
require cleaning up under the program, a number that could grow to
2,000 or more, according to congressional staffers.
   The Reagan administration budget proposes spending $1.75 billion
in fiscal l990 for Superfund cleanup, an increase of $325 million
over this year. But Traxler suggested that without major changes in
the program, the EPA may not get the funds it wants.

   The stock market jumped ahead in heavy trading
today, carrying its early-1989 rally to new highs amid signs of
slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 46.97 points to
2,338.04 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 990 up, 446 down and
474 unchanged.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that
the gross national product grew at a annual rate of 2 percent, after
adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street,
and provided a fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy
was slowing to a sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace.
   Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term
government bonds by about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock
prices that has already been gathering steam of late.
   Brokers said a strong dollar in foreign exchange helped stir up
investors' enthusiasm for stocks.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose 1[ to 48~;
Ford Motor 1\ to 52~; International Business Machines 1] to 127],
and General Electric 1[ to 48.
   Apple Computer tumbled 4\ to 37{ as by far the most active issue
in the over-the-counter market. The company said earnings for its
second fiscal quarter ending March 30 are expected to fall to the
range of 35 to 45 cents a share from 61 cents a share in the
comparable period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.89 to 165.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .41 at 321.83.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 194.36 million shares with two

<HEAD>Japanese Middle Class Squeezed By Skyrocketing Prices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's a time of grumbling for many in the broad
Japanese middle class who have been excluded from the boom of the
late 1980s.
   Squeezed by high prices and unlucky in not owning land, these
people are voicing a dissatisfaction that, the government worries,
may fuel a sense of injustice and upset the social unity of postwar
Japan.
   About 90 percent of all Japanese are considered part of the
middle class. Janitors, factory workers and office clerks alike
dress the part as they travel to and from work.
   Middle-class conformity was reinforced for decades by small gaps
in income and by social values that discouraged flaunting wealth.
   But skyrocketing land prices due to financial speculation and
strong demand for office and residential space have made those who
own real estate enormously wealthy, while others have abandoned
hopes of home-ownership.
   Residential land prices in Tokyo, home to one-tenth of Japan's
122 million people, rose 68.8 percent in 1987 after climbing 40.5
percent in 1986. The average price of an 874 square-foot condominium
now is nearly $500,000, or seven times the disposable annual income
of an average family of four, according to an Economic Planning
Agency report.
   In most European or American cities, the cost is only four times
annual earnings, and the living space at least twice as large.
Californians last summer complained that the median cost of a home
had risen to $160,000, less than one-third the cost of the average
apartment in Tokyo.
   First-time home purchases are almost impossible in large cities
like Tokyo. While the national home ownership rate is 62 percent, in
Tokyo it is 44 percent.
   About 70 percent of Japanese in surveys say they want to own
their homes, even if it's inconveniently far from work, but more
than half of the 20- to 40-year-old men say they've given up.
   The proportion of Tokyo households expecting to eventually buy a
home fell from 33 percent in 1977 to 15 percent in 1987.
   Rents average $500 a month for about 500 square feet. Those who
bought suburban homes before the recent surge in land prices pay
about $600 a month on mortgages _ some run for as long as 75 years _
and spend three to five hours commuting each day.
   Some snapshots of the harried middle class:
   _Emiko Shiroishi, 30, her small daughter and husband pay $600 a
month for a 450-square-foot, three-room apartment in northern Tokyo,
hoping to eventually buy an apartment outside the city.
   _Company worker Hiroto Furukawa, 38, lives with his wife and
three children in a slightly larger apartment about an hour outside
Tokyo. He bought before the recent surge in prices and is paying a
35-year mortgage.
   _Toshihide Tabe, a company employee, complains in a letter to the
Asahi Shumbun newspaper that in his family, ``we are still hounded
by housing, car and education loans. ... Salary earners are all in
the same boat.''
   Tokyo homeowners held real estate averaging nearly $700,000 in
value in 1987, said a government study, concluding that the gap
between haves and have-nots is inciting a growing sense of injustice.
   Of Japan's 100 top income-earners last year, 77 were involved in
real estate deals, tax officials say. Timber firm president Hajime
Kitami, 53, topped the list with $53.6 million in income, much of it
from land sales.
   Rising educational costs and the need to save for retirement
squeeze most Japanese harder. Families paid an average $106 a month
on educational costs in 1987 _ a figure that escalates as children
approach college age.
   ``Once average people like us pay our rent and taxes, there's
hardly enough left to eat. Lots of people really have to watch their
pennies and scrimp to get by,'' says 60-year-old Fumiteru Shimizu.
   ``Only in Japan can people work hard for 30 years and not be able
to afford to buy even a small house,'' Shimizu says.
   The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper commented: ``One factor which has
made Japan relatively stable socially and economically has been the
sense of equality among the people. Income, assets and the standard
of living are no longer perceived as level. ... Is this not
signaling that our social stability is beginning to shake? Those who
are responsible for tax, agricultural and administrative reforms
should take the signal seriously.''
   The trends alarm the government which, despite its strengths, has
failed to manage well one of Japan's scarcest resources, land. ``The
gap in net worth between those who own land and those who do not is
widening, creating a feeling of social inadequacy,'' said a recent
government land report.
   Labor unions and business circles are pressing for improvements
in living standards.
   While Japan's per capita national income is about $16,000, the
world's highest, ``the Japanese people can scarcely be said to enjoy
a quality of life that compares with the living standards of other
industrial nations,'' said Toshikuni Yahiro, vice chairman of the
Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, in a policy proposal to
the government last fall.
   Yahiro partly blamed regulations that protect such special
interest groups as farmers and retailers.
   Japanese consumers pay five to six times what Americans pay for
rice and nine times what they pay for beef, according to a survey by
the Japan Federation of Employers Associations.
   ``The fact that prices in Japan are fairly stable is no excuse
for overlooking their grossly high level,'' the Asahi Shimbun said
in an editorial entitled, ``Get Angry, Japanese Consumers.''

<HEAD>Dollar Surges In Europe, Gold Falls Sharply</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: AMs version expected by 5:30 p.m. EST.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar surged against major foreign
currencies in European trading Friday, overcoming what dealers said
was repeated central bank intervention.
   Gold prices fell by about $7 an ounce, finishing below the
psychologically important level of $400 an ounce.
   Foreign exchange dealers said central banks intervened twice in
the day to sell dollars in an effort to keep exchange rates down.
But the selling only encouraged the markets to regard the American
currency as a good buy, dealers said.
   They said the U.S. Federal Reserve entered the market alone for a
third time, late in the day, but it failed to stem the dollar's
rally.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7655 late Friday, cheaper
for buyers than Thursday's late $1.7730.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Thursday's late rates: 1.8570 West German marks, up from 1.8440;
1.5743 Swiss francs, up from 1.5671; 6.2875 French francs, up from
6.2705; 2.0880 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,352.37 Italian
lire, up from 1,350.25; 1.1853 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1816.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.65 Japanese yen, up
from 127.52 yen. In London late Friday the dollar traded higher at
128.93 yen.
   Dealers said gold was hit by the dollar's strength. As long as
the dollar continues to rise strongly the market will have little
choice but to lower the gold price to attract buyers, they said.
   In London, gold closed at a bid $398.25 a troy ounce, down from
$405.75 late Thursday. The Zurich late bid price was $398.75, down
from $405.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $403.99 bid, down from
$407.70.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.02 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.19.

<HEAD>Swiss Lift Banking Secrecy In Probe With French, U.S. Links</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swiss authorities on Friday ordered bank
records linked to the unfolding insider trading scandal in France to
be turned over to U.S. investigators who uncovered the affair.
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last Tuesday had
asked the Swiss Federal Office of Police Affairs to help in the
Pechiney-Triangle probe by ordering a suspension of strict banking
secrecy rules.
   Approval of the U.S. request also means that any assets frozen in
bank accounts in Switzerland could be turned over to the United
States once the investigators submit more detailed allegations on
the size and location of funds.
   Swiss justice ministry sources said the order applies to
documents on blocked accounts at five Swiss banks and two financial
services companies. The accounts were frozen after a preliminary
U.S. intervention with Bern last month.
   All parties concerned have 10 days to appeal the order.
   Friday's action was the first on a ``judicial help'' request
concerning insider trading since strengthened Swiss legislation took
effect last July 1. Part of the legislation's aim was to avoid past
tension with U.S. authorities in international probes.
   Under a Swiss-U.S. treaty, judicial assistance can only be
granted when alleged offenses are criminal in both countries.
   Friday's justice ministry statement noted that France to date has
not asked for Swiss judicial aid.
   The affair involves allegations that people with confidential,
advance information made huge illegal stock market profits when the
French state-owned aluminum company Pechiney bought out U.S.-based
Triangle Industries last November.
   Close associates of French President Francois Mitterrand have
been implicated in the affair, which has preoccupied the Socialist
government.
   Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy called Thursday for a complete
criminal probe into the allegations.
   The SEC alerted French authorities after noticing abnormally
heavy purchases of Triangle shares in the week before Pechiney
publicly launched its successful takeover bid Nov. 21.
   Pechiney ultimately bought Triangle, the former parent of
American National Can Corp., for $56 a share, nearly six times their
value a week before.

   Tandy Corp. announced Friday that it
planned to buy back up to 10 million of its outstanding common
shares, a move that could cost the electronics company more than
$400 million.
   ``Basically, this affirms our belief that Tandy stock has been
undervalued,'' said Phillip M. Bradtmiller, a Tandy spokesman.
``This is an efficient use of our excess resources.''
   The company said it planned to buy the stock from time to time in
the open market and finance the purchases through current funds and
short-term borrowings.
   Tandy was trading at $41.87{ a share in late-afternoon dealings
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the buyback plan a
value of around $418.75 million.
   At the end of 1988 Tandy had about 90 million common shares
outstanding.

   Two TV satellite transmission companies,
Bonneville Satellite Communications and Wold Communications Inc.,
have agreed to merge, the companies announced.
   The privately held firms declined to reveal financial terms of
the deal, other than to say that Salt Lake City-based Bonneville
would own 60 percent of the new entity and Wold, of Los Angeles,
would hold 40 percent.
   A name for the new company hasn't been chosen, they said in
announcing the deal Thursday. The companies said they had sought
approval for the combination from the Federal Communications
Commission, and would continue to operate separately pending a
decision, expected in 60 days.
   Bonneville is best known for transmitting news and sports,
including Cable News Network feeds and National Basketball
Association games to local stations. The company also serves
corporations seeking satellite links between headquarters and
outlying offices.
   Wold calls itself the nation's biggest distributor of syndicated
television programming to independent TV stations and transmits news
for Japanese companies.
   Bonneville Satellite is a partnership of Simmons Satellite Inc.
and Bonneville International Corp.
   Wold's biggest shareholder is Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe, a
New York investment firm. Other investors include Cox

   Futures prices of grains and soybeans were mostly
lower in lackluster trading Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A flurry of selling on technical market factors by big brokerage

pressure came from a bearish weather forecast, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   A weekend forecast for crop-enhancing rain in the nation's

he said.
   Losses in corn futures were tempered by ``optimism that the
Russians will be coming in to buy more corn,'' Lespinasse said.

<HEAD>Thousands of Auto Dealers Gathering for Annual Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As America's automobile dealers gather for
their annual convention, many of them are wondering whether
Washington will take action that could cause prices of popular
sport-utility vehicles and vans will soar.
   More than 20,000 dealers and others connected with the industry
get together this weekend through Tuesday for the 72nd National
Automobile Dealers Association convention.
   The group will install its new president for 1989, Ron Tonkin of
Ron Tonkin Dealerships in Portland, Ore. Tonkin, not known to mince
words, will take office at the close of the convention Tuesday, and
is expected to issue a strong call for increased unity among the
dealers to stand up against the automakers.
   ``United, the dealers have more net worth than General Motors by
far,'' he said in a pre-convention interview. ``Our job is to
harness that horsepower.''
   But on the minds of many dealers is a proposal for the Treasury
Department to boost the tariff on imported sport-utility vehicles
and some vans to 25 percent of their cost.
   U.S. manufacturers support and overseas companies oppose the
move, which could limit the influx of foreign-made versions of the
hot-selling vehicles.
   Earlier this month, the chairmen of General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady in an unusual joint letter to uphold a Customs Service
recommendation that would classify sport-utility vehicles and some
other vehicles as trucks. That would make the vehicles subject to a
25 percent tariff instead of the 2.5 percent fee charged on imported
cars.
   The executives, GM's Roger B. Smith, Ford's Donald Petersen and
Chrysler's Lee Iacocca, said if the increased fee is not charged it
would ``cause substantial harm to the U.S. motor vehicle industry,
deprive the U.S. Treasury of several hundred million dollars in
anticipated tariff revenues and unleash a long battle in the courts
and in Congress to restore a clear and consistent rule.''
   The dealers feel differently.
   Auto dealers increasingly are diversifying their product lines.
Ford, Chevrolet and Dodge dealers, for instance, more frequently
offer imported cars and trucks as a hedge against a downturn in the
U.S. industry and to lure more customers to their showrooms.
   Many of the foreign automakers produce sport-utility vehicles,
similar to the American Jeeps. Prices of the imported versions range
from less than $8,495 for a Suzuki Samurai to more than $35,800 for
the Range Rover from England.
   The American International Automobile Dealers Association said
imposing the 25-percent tariff would harm its 9,000 members and the
public. The organization claims the tariff will add an average
$2,500 to the cost of each imported van or sport-utility vehicle,
which make up about 18 percent of total import sales and about 30
percent of the profits of dealers who sell them.
   The group and some dealers also have speculated that if the
tariff is approved, the Big Three U.S. automakers won't be able to
resist the opportunity to raise their prices somewhat less than 25
percent to increase profits.

   The pace is frenzied, the stakes high, the players
often young and the opportunity for clandestine cheating ripe at the
nation's largest futures exchanges, where the sometimes-sleazy
workings have been bared in a federal investigation of alleged fraud.
   Even discreet dealings are under scrutiny by investigators
examining mountains of documents subpoenaed in the probe of the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, where
fortunes are made and lost betting on the future prices of
everything from pig bellies to Treasury bonds.
   More than 200 traders, brokers and financial firms also have been
subpoenaed and fear has pervaded trading pits where millions of
dollars in commodities futures are bought and sold daily.
   Federal officials are refusing to comment, but the investigation
reportedly centers on allegations that as many as 100 brokers and
traders systematically cheated customers and profited themselves in
illegal trades.
   The probe hasn't produced indictments yet. But insiders predict
it will wipe out fortunes and could lead to sweeping changes in one
of Chicago's most vital and oldest industries.
   Those caught in the FBI trap could face charges ranging from
fraud to racketeering, said Harvey Silets, an attorney for
subpoenaed traders at both exchanges.
   ``It's going to be bad,'' said a former Mercantile Exchange
trader who now works for a top brokerage. ``There's going to be a
lot of punishment meted out. There's going to be a lot of guilty
pleading and guilty finding.''
   BOT and Merc officials, along with traders and others who earn
their living at the exchanges, complain that the highly publicized
investigation wrongly implies the industry is full of crooks.
   ``The vast majority of the people down there are honest...just
trying to make a buck,'' said a trader in the Board of Trade's
Treasury bond pit, which was infiltrated by an FBI agent wearing a
hidden microphone and posing as a trader.
   But other industry insiders say in a field that attracts young
hotshots eager for a fast fortune, odds for fraud are high.
   ``I would say that people in this business are going to be
subjected to much more temptation,'' said the former Mercantile
Exchange trader, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity
surrounding the probe.
   ``You have relatively young, relatively inexperienced people in a
field where very, very, very large sums of money are moving around
very quickly.''
   In a typical transaction, an investor phones a brokerage and
orders a commodity at the market price. The order goes a phone clerk
at the firm's trading-floor booth.
   The clerk writes the order on a floor-order ticket and gives it
to a firm ``runner'' who literally runs to a floor broker by the
trading pit. The floor broker asks other pit traders for the current
price.
   Once he finds someone selling at the best price for his client _
it usually takes less than a minute _ the floor broker exchanges
hand or eye signals with the trader to seal the deal.
   The trader documents it on a trading card while the broker
records the transaction on the order card. The deal is punched into
a computer.
   Insiders say the system invites opportunities for illicit
practices.
   ``If we're talking about fraud against the customer order, the
easiest way and the hardest way to catch'' occurs when a customer
places a ``limit'' order, saying he'll pay no more than a certain
price, said the former Merc trader.
   Instead of buying for the customer at the market price, say $7,
the floor broker gambles the price will rise. With pit prices
fluctuating, the floor broker winks to a trader friend as the price
hits $7, and the trader buys from an innocent third-party at that
price.
   ``If the market goes up to $8, I buy from (the trader-friend) at
$8, he made $1 and the customer paid $8'' when he could have paid
only $7, the ex-trader said.
   ``What you're doing is holding the order off the market for a
brief period of time'' _ seconds _ with hopes the price will rise
and allow for illegal profiteering, called bucketing or cuffing, he
said.
   ``Absent a sting operation ... or a pattern, it is very, very
hard to detect,'' said Stephen Selig, a futures law professor at New
York University.
   Such deals aren't common but they're said to be a target of the
FBI probe.
   ``It's bad, it's malicious and it's thievery and people who get
caught doing it should be hung,'' said the ex-trader. ``They have
maliciously removed money from the game and they should get
hammered.''
   But he and other insiders fear the government also will prosecute
others who violate exchange rules, but don't necessarily hurt anyone.
   One such practice is called trading at the curb, or after the
session ends, to reconcile discrepancies that arise in the confusion
of a hectic market.
   ``People are concerned that the BOT has done a very good job of
policing its own members ... (and) that people who don't understand
our business ... are going to wind up having authority over it,''
said the Treasury bond trader.
   The Merc and BOT quickly punish rule violators, said Richard
Troelstrup, an attorney who represents at least one supboena target.
The hard part is catching violators, and the industry largely
depends on members to police themselves.
   The probe began two years ago after Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a
Decatur, Ill.-based agricultural conglomerate, complained it was
cheated by soybean traders.
   ``One of the people that perceived themselves being wronged was
more connected in Washington than God,'' the ex-Merc trader said,
referring to ADM's chairman, Dwayne Andreas.
   ``His people complained to the BOT, `We think we're getting
ripped off in the soybean pit.' The BOT investigated and didn't find
anything,'' but Andreas wasn't satisified and sought government
help, he said.
   ``My guess is ADM (was) just losing money...having a rough time
in the market,'' and wanted a scapegoat, the ex-trader said.
   ADM spokesman Richard Burket and BOT aides have declined to
comment.
   Officials at both exchanges say they did not learn of the
investigation until the Tribune published its story.
   Traders ``were taken totally by surprise'' to learn that some pit
colleagues were FBI agents, said the Treasury Bond trader.
   Legitimate traders may not have suspected an FBI sting, but in
some cases the undercover agents behaved oddly. One, for example,
lost heavily one day and mysteriously bounced back.
   ``He attracted attention because there was no known source of
funds'' to account for the recovery,'' Troelstrup said. ``As it
turned out, he had a rather deep source of funds'' _ the government.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission _ the federal regulatory
agency of the commodities markets _ says it has adequately policed
the industry.
   Nonetheless, the Mercantile Exchange has appointed a panel of
industry and outside representatives to review transaction rules and
recommend revisions.
   ``We have to prove to the world that we can be an honest place
where a public order will not be subject to dishonest hands,'' said
Leo Melamed, chief counsel at the Merc.

<HEAD>Fear, No Gloating On New York Futures Exchanges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official at the New York Cotton Exchange
gleefully displays a handful of buttons the Chicago Board of Trade
once distributed to promote its range of interest-rate futures
products.
   The buttons read: ``CBOT trading opportunities: from 30 years to
30 days,'' an inscription rendered ironic by the sweeping federal
undercover investigation of alleged fraud at the Chicago Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``I understand these are going to become very valuable,'' the
official says as he stashes the buttons in a desk drawer.
   Similar wry humor can be found among traders of gold and silver
futures as they leave the floor of New York's Commodity Exchange.
   ``Whaddaya, wearin' a wire?'' one trader asks a reporter who is
gathering reactions to the Chicago scandal.
   ``Please speak into the microphone,'' says another, eliciting
chuckles from his fellow traders as the elevator door slides shut.
   Pit traders as a rule are a cocky bunch, their thick skins and
swaggers an essential defense in a profession that rewards steely
nerves and can ruin the nervous.
   But their wisecracks about the Chicago probe mask a fear on the
New York futures exchanges that whatever comes out of the
investigation will be bad news for the entire futures industry.
   ``I don't see anything funny about it,'' said a mid-level
employee of one of the five exchanges that operate on the 8th floor
of 4 World Trade Center. ``It's frightening.''
   The East Coast exchanges _ the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange;
the Commodity Exchange; the New York Cotton Exchange; the New York
Futures Exchange; and the New York Mercantile Exchange _ cannot
escape the shadow of Chicago's futures markets, which are the
world's largest and account for about three-quarters of all the
futures contracts traded in the United States.
   The New York exchanges trade some products, like crude oil,
platinum, frozen orange juice, coffee and cotton, that aren't traded
in Chicago. But they operate in same way, with traders facing off in
pits and using a 140-year-old system of shouts and hand signals to
trade contracts for future delivery of commodities.
   One trader said that in the wake of the first reports of the
Chicago investigation, which surfaced a little more than a week ago,
traders in New York have grown more wary of their associates
although no similar probe has been revealed in their own markets.
   He said they also feared the prices of seats on the New York
exchanges would tumble as they did in Chicago, sharply reducing the
cash value of membership. But panic selling of seats did not spread
east.
   Exchange seats are traded as commodities and held as investments.
More importantly, they give their holders the right to enter the
trading pits where they can observe price movements firsthand and
are in the best position to profit from those changes.
   The Chicago probe has turned a spotlight on the long-standing
tradition of dual trading, which allows pit traders to trade on
behalf of customers and for their own accounts, provided they
execute the customer orders first.
   Critics say dual trading is easily abused: in certain market
conditions, an unscrupulous trader can switch to his own account a
profitable trade he originally made on a customer's behalf, then
execute the customer's order again at a smaller profit than the
customer should have received.
   But exchange officials say the right to trade for one's own
account while also executing orders for brokerage firms is what
draws independent speculators to the pits, increasing the number of
pit traders and creating liquid markets.
   The potential outcome of the Chicago investigation that New York
exchange officials fear most is new legislation that would restrict
the traditional open-outcry trading method and outlaw dual trading.
   ``The worst thing that could happen would be for there to turn
out to be a massive, widespread trading-impropriety problem in
Chicago,'' said Alan J. Brody, president of the Commodity Exchange.
   ``If that be the case _ and I cross my fingers and hope that's
not the case _ the worst result would be that it would cast a shadow
over the entire industry, which includes us in New York, and we wind
up facing regulatory proposals.''
   Brody said dual trading has made the U.S. futures markets the
most liquid markets in the world.
   ``I would hate to see us throw out all that in the face of what I
hope not to be a real widespread problem,'' he said.

   The stock market ran up another strong gain in
heavy trading today, capping off the best week so far in a rally
that began more than two months ago.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that
the gross national product grew at a annual rate of 2 percent, after
adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street,
and provided a fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy
was slowing to a sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace.
   Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term
government bonds about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock
prices that has already been gathering steam of late.
   Brokers said a strong dollar in foreign exchange also helped stir
up investors' enthusiasm for stocks.

<HEAD>Merc's Globex Plan Moving Full-Steam Ahead Despite Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said Friday that
its plans for a computerized, worldwide trading system haven't been
stalled by the spreading scandal of a federal probe of suspected
fraudulent futures trading.
   Implementation of the system, known as Globex, is a key element
in the exchange's attempts to conduct after-hours global futures
trading. At the same time, some observers believe electronic trading
systems in general cut the opportunities for fraud.
   ``Globex is on track and we've had as much interest as we've ever
had,'' said Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   The Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's largest
commodities exchanges, are targets of a two-year federal probe in
which FBI agents posed as traders and secretly tape-recorded
conversation on the trading floor.
   Some commodities market analysts have pointed to increased
computerization as a means to curb fraud and profit skimming by
floor traders. Under the ``open outcry'' system now used in the pits
traders shout and use hand signals to arrange trades, making it
difficult to detect improper activity.
   ``The Globex system will have an almost-perfect audit trail,''
Yemma said.
   Globex _ a project of the Merc and Reuters America Inc. _ is
scheduled to come on line this fall with limited trading between New
York and Chicago. Full worldwide trading is to begin in 1990, Yemma
said.
   The system would be activated at 6 p.m. _ the Merc closes at 3:15
p.m. CST _ and trade electronically with futures markets on other
continents until 6 a.m., with the Merc reopening at 7:20 a.m. CST.
   With Globex, Merc trading will be conducted nearly 20 hours a day.
   The network would link investors in North America, Europe and
Asia for trading of futures and options contracts on currency
futures, including the British pound, the West German mark, the
Swiss and French francs, Australian and Canadian dollars, and the
Japanese yen.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange voted Thursday to join Globex, a
move Yemma called ``a big boost'' for the Chicago exchange.
   Yemma labeled as ``completely erroneous'' reporters that several
European financial institutions backed away from involvement in the
network because of the ongoing federal investigation of the Merc and
the Board of Trade, revealed last week.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the independent federal
agency that regulates the industry, must approve the system before
it can begin operations.
   Under federal trading rules, brokers are required to record
transactions to the nearest minute. Timing is critical because of
rapid price changes.
   The new system will automatically record trade times to the
nearest second, even though Globex only operates when the floor pits
are closed.
   Critics, including the rival Board of Trade, say the system _ and
computerized trading in general _ may make the markets vulnerable to
computer hackers.
   ``We're not saying it's completely foolproof,'' said Yemma.
``We're trying to thwart any kind of illegal activity we can think
of.''
   Last September, the Board of Trade issued a 51-page statement
condemning Globex.
   ``We're not against computerized trading per se,'' BOT spokesman
Mark Prout said Friday. ``But we don't think it covers all the
routes of possible manipulation.''
   In addition to the hacker threat, Prout said, the system still
would allow pre-arranged, fraudulent trades.
   ``We think the system should be perfected...and debugged before
it could be considered,'' said Prout.
   He said he doesn't foresee using Globex even if it proves
successful at the Merc, noting the BOT already has a session from 5
p.m. to 8:30 p.m. to provide access to overseas markets.

<HEAD>Appetite For Junk Undiminished As Big RJR Bond Issue Gets Swallowed
Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors are gobbling up the biggest junk bond
offering in history, indicating the appetite for high-risk,
high-yield securities has not been blunted by the unsavory situation
facing a key issuer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The $3 billion of bonds being used to help finance the leveraged
buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by LBO specialists Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. is oversubscribed, an industry source said. Drexel, a
pioneer in junk bond financing and still the leader in the business,
is handling the offer.
   Plenty of the sophisticated, institutional investors who have
been asked by Drexel if they want to buy the bonds apparently have
expressed an interest in them, the source said.
   Placing the bonds with customers is one of the last things that
must be done before the record $25 billion buyout can be completed.
After this, the only thing needed is approval from government
antitrust investigators.
   Neither Drexel nor KKR would confirm that the offer is sold out.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said, ``We are very pleased with
the response. I think it reflects the fact that it was structured to
appeal to buyers around the world.''
   A Kohlberg Kravis Roberts spokeswoman said, ``The issue has been
well received.''
   Although customers haven't made any binding purchase commitments
and could still turn Drexel down, analysts expect the sales to go
off without a hitch.
   Anreder said the bonds will be priced next week, after which they
can be formally distributed to the institutional investors, such as
pension funds and insurance companies, who agree to buy them.
   The successful conclusion of the offering would be a significant
milestone for the junk bond market and provide fresh evidence that
it has staying power even though Drexel, the engine of its
development, has been entangled in the nation's biggest securities
fraud scandal.
   This past week details came out of the bargain Drexel made with
the government to settle criminal charges against the firm.
   Besides promising to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay an
unprecedented $650 million in fines and restitution, Drexel agreed
to fire its junk bond wizard Michael R. Milken and not to pay him
his 1988 bonus, which could be as high as $200 million.
   As head of Drexel's high-yield bond department, based in Beverly
Hills, Calif., Milken was considered king of the business and the
one who carried Drexel to the top of the junk bond hill.
   When the depth of Drexel's and Milken's difficulties became known
last year, there was speculation that the entire $180 billion market
in junk bonds would suffer and Drexel would be toppled permanently
from its lofty perch.
   Instead, the market appears to be doing fine and Drexel is
maintaining its dominance of the business.
   Proponents of high-yield, high-risk securities say the market
deserves more respect than it gets and many such analysts were
unsurprised that the huge RJR bond offering appears easily
digestible by investors hungry for the appealing returns that the
bonds will provide.
   ``It doesn't surprise me at all. The market has grown so much in
the last few years and it's really performing a social and economic
function,'' said Robert Waill, a managing director of L.F.
Rothschild Holdings Inc.
   ``The whole thing has gotten broader and broader and it has
happened for fairly sensible reasons,'' he said, noting that many
institutional investors with huge, well diversified portfolios have
come to rely on so-called junk bonds to complement their more
conservative, lower-yielding holdings.
   Smaller investors searching for big returns who shouldn't take
the risk of buying the bonds individually, can put money in mutual
funds devoted to the bonds, he said.
   Says Waill, ``The market has been converted from a crap shoot to
a dull statistical business.''

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas' Quarterly Profit Up 60 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s fourth-quarter profit
jumped 60 percent chiefly due to lower costs and an improved
performance in its combat aircraft division, the company reported
Friday.
   The aerospace firm said after-tax earnings in the three months
ended Dec. 31 were $145 million, or $3.79 per share, on revenue of
$4.3 billion, compared with earnings of $93 million, or $2.32 per
share, and revenue of $3.6 billion in the same period in 1987.
   In a reversal of 1987's experience, earnings expanded robustly in
the combat aircraft segment largely because production costs were
lower.
   The division had difficulties in 1987 bringing out new models of
the F-15 and F@A-18.
   ``Most of these difficulties had been resolved by the fourth
quarter of 1988, with a strongly positive effect on earnings,'' the
company stated.
   For all of 1988, the company had a profit of $350 million, or
$9.13 per share, on revenue of $15 billion, up 11 percent from
1987's earnings of $313 million, or $7.75 per share. Revenue in 1987
was $13.7 billion.
   Earnings for the year increased in all segments except
information systems, the company said. Combat aircraft and space
systems and missiles recorded the largest gains.
   The manufacturer said earnings for both 1987 and 1988 were
adversely affected by production disruptions related to increased
transport aircraft production rates and introduction of new combat
aircraft, high research and development expenditures and increase
interest expense.
   Firm backlog at the end of 1988 was $26.3 billion, up from $18.9
billion in 1987. Total backlog was $40.5 billion, compared with $33
billion a year earlier.
   Firm backlog excludes government orders not yet funded, orders
being negotiated as continuations of authorized programs, and
commercial orders subject to contingencies.

   Aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith, who gave
Britain its finest fighter planes in three wars and designed the
aircraft that brought down Germany's legendary ``Red Baron'' in
World War I, died Friday. He was 101.
   ``The genius of flight is dead,'' said a headline in the Evening
Standard newspaper of London.
   ``Tommy'' Sopwith died in his sleep in his mansion near
Winchester in southern England. ``Really he died of old age, but
he's had a marvelous innings (life),'' said his son, Thomas.
   Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith was born Jan. 18, 1888, into a
wealthy engineering family. He was the first son after seven
daughters.
   He was an accomplished race car driver, yachtsman and balloonist
when he taught himself to fly in 1910. The Wright brothers had made
the first powered flight in 1903 in the United States.
   After walking away from several crashes, Sopwith was given the
31st aviator's license issued in Britain.
   ``We had a lot of crashes in those days, but, bless you, it was
fun,'' he recalled on his 100th birthday.
   He was soon breaking flying records in Britain and the United
States and was the first pilot to drop mail onto a ship's deck when
he delivered a parcel to the liner Olympic as it steamed out of New
York harbor.
   Sopwith used money from American flying prizes to set up the
Sopwith Aviation Co. in 1912, producing the Sopwith Pup, Snipe and
Camel planes.
   The Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter shot down 1,294 enemy
planes in World War I, the most kills for any aircraft in that war.
Germany's legendary ``Red Baron,'' Manfred von Richthofen, was shot
down by British pilot Roy Brown in a Camel.
   After the war, Sopwith founded the Hawker Siddeley company, along
with his Australian mechanic and test pilot Harry Hawker and friend
Fred Sigrist. The company made him a millionaire by the 1930s.
   He built and sailed the racing yachts Endeavour and Endeavour II
in unsuccessful bids for the America's Cup in 1934 and 1937.
   When the Air Ministry couldn't make up its mind in 1936 about a
new breed of fighters, Sopwith ordered his factories to build 1,000
of the rugged monoplane eight-gun Hurricanes designed by Sydney Camm.
   The Air Ministry bought them and the Hurricane formed the air
force backbone in the 1940 Battle of Britain. In that battle, it
destroyed more enemy planes than all the rest of the air and ground
defenses combined, including the faster Spitfire.
   Sopwith was knighted in 1953.
   In the 1960s, Sopwith's team developed the Harrier vertical
takeoff fighter, which Britain used against the Argentine air force
in the 1982 Falklands war. The Harrier is one of the U.S. Marine
Corps.' favored aircraft.
   Sopwith said the Harrier's high technology made it the favorite
of all his planes.
   ``He was one of the greatest figures in aviation history. He made
a major contribution to classic aircraft design in the defense of
freedom in two world wars,'' said Sir Roland Smith, chairman of
British Aerospace PLC.
   Sopwith retired as Hawker Siddeley chairman in 1963 but remained
a director until age 90.
   Sopwith was over 6 feet tall and smoked heavily until he was 92.
He outlived both his wives and was survived by his only son, Thomas,
a former race car driver. He had planned to move in with his
56-year-old son, and his 2,200-acre Compton Manor sporting estate is
for sale for a reputed $24 million.
   Sopwith was blind by his 100th birthday when a procession of his
planes, from the Camel to the Harrier, flew over his home in tribute.
   A private funeral will be held Feb. 3. A memorial service will be
held later.

<HEAD>Texas Thrift Customers Questioning Proposed Depositor Fee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loan customers were grumbling Friday
about a proposal to slap them with a new fee in order to bail out
failing thrifts, but S&amp;L officials say they've seen few withdrawals
as a result of the proposal.
   But depositors asked in a spot check of Dallas savings and loans
on Friday indicated they would wait and see if the fee actually was
adopted before taking any action.
   Judy Rollerson, a teller at Metropolitan Savings, said several
customers mentioned the proposal but none indicated they would close
their accounts.
   ``They don't think it will really happen,'' she said. ``They're
just talking about how preposterous it really is.''
   Savings and loan officials have been watching customer reaction
since the Bush administration indicated that one option for
financing a federal bailout of troubled thrifts would be to charge
S&amp;L, bank and credit union customers 25 cents per every $100 they
had deposited.
   The measure would require Congressional approval.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said
Thursday that the proposal was making savings and loan depositors
nervous and had led some to withdraw their money.
   Since Wednesday, Wall said, ``There have been cases where they
say, `I don't like what I heard on TV, I'm taking my money out.' ''
   Depositor reaction to the proposal had not placed any savings and
loans in jeopardy, he said.
   Financial industry officials in Dallas, as well as their
customers, indicated there have been few account closings as a
result of the deposit tax trial balloon.
   ``We've had a few questions to it,'' said Ruth Lack, director of
corporate communications for First Gibraltar, FSB in Houston. ``We
have not had any action on it. Most of our depositors realize that
this is nothing more than a trial at this point.''
   George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas, stated there has been ``no measurable increase in deposit
withdrawals'' due to publicity about the proposed fee, and credited
consumer confidence that the government would uphold the safety of
their deposits.
   An official with Southwest Savings Association who refused to
identify herself said she has sensed ``quite a bit of concern''
among customers.
   ``People don't want to have to pay to save their money,'' she
said. ``If I had a savings account and had to pay, I'd close it, I'm
sorry.''
   Some customers said they probably would withdraw their money if
the deposit fee was implemented.
   ``I have a lot of money in savings and loans, and I hate that
proposal,'' said one customer at the Southwest Savings downtown
branch.
   ``Right now, I'm reading George Bush's lips. I hope they drop it.
If they don't, it's going to hurt savings and loans _ a lot,'' said
the customer, who declined to give his name.
   Nevertheless, the customer said he would wait and see if the fee
was imposed before moving his money.
   Several customers said they had not heard about the fee.
   Only one of eight Dallas savings and loans branches contacted
Friday reported a withdrawal, although the majority declined to
comment.
   One Dallas man promptly withdrew his money from Sunbelt Savings
after hearing of the fee proposal, said account representative Tim
Palla.
   ``He came in with a smile on his face and said, `I can't handle
this any more. It isn't you people, it's the government,'' Palla
said.
   Palla said that was the only withdrawal he knew of. Other
customers have called with questions about the proposed fee, he said.

<HEAD>Economic Indicators Spark Plunge In Precious Metals Futures</HEAD>

   Bullish U.S. economic indicators sent gold futures prices
plummeting in trading Friday at the New York Commodity Exchange, and
silver prices followed suit.
   On other markets, copper, cattle and heating oil futures prices
rallied; pork prices were mixed; grain, soybean and crude oil prices
were mostly lower; and unleaded gasoline prices declined.
   The government reported that the gross national product rose 3.8
percent last year, the best showing in four years.
   The GNP report, along with the ``tremendous strength of the
dollar ... defuses inflationary pressure, and that's what fuels
precious metals,'' said Bette Raptopoulous, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Gold prices settled $6.90 to $9.40 lower, with the contract for
delivery in February at $396.10 a troy ounce. Silver prices were
22.1 cents to 24.6 cents lower with the February contract at $5.88 a
troy ounce.
   Copper futures rallied on confirmation of a strike at a major
refinery in Mexico, Ms. Raptopoulous said.
   Traders bought copper futures contracts on expectations that the
walkout will result in a tightening of copper supplies.
   Copper prices were 3.40 cents lower to 3.10 cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in February at $1.51 a pound.
   Cattle futures rallied sharply, bolstered by Agriculture
Department cattle-on-feed figures released after the close of
trading Thursday.
   The quarterly report showed that the number of cattle on the
nation's feed lots _ those to be fattened for slaughter _ increased
only 5 percent in December 1988 over the same month in 1987.
   ``The market had factored in about a 10 percent increase,'' and
the lower figure reported by the USDA encouraged buying of cattle
futures, analysts said.
   Further support came from the approach of February, declared by
the industry as ``national meat month.''
   ``Retailers have a tendency to promote beef a little more
aggressively'' during the month, which tightens supplies and helps
account for the rise in futures prices, analysts said.
   Pork prices were mixed, under pressure from weak spot prices and
other negative fundamentals. But the strength in the cattle market
kept the pork complex from plunging, analysts noted.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent to 1.40 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in February at 73.40 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were 1.22 cents to 1.50 cents higher, with March at 83.17
cents a pound; live hogs were .38 cent lower to .22 cent higher,
with February at 42.32 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
1.20 cent lower to .20 cent higher, with February at 38.60 cents a
pound.
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower at the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   A flurry of selling on technical market factors by big brokerage
houses kept the lid on wheat and soybean prices, and further
pressure came from a weekend forecast for crop-enhancing rain in the
nation's winter-wheat growing regions, said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 4{ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery for March at $4.40{ a bushel; corn was unchanged to { cent
higher with March at $2.71} a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 8 cents
lower with March at $2.12 a bushel; and soybeans settled 7\ cents
lower to 1} cents higher, with March at $7.54 a bushel.
   Crude oil prices were mostly lower, heating oil prices rallied
and unleaded gasoline fell in trading at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 7 cents higher with the March
contract at $17.74 a barrel; heating oil was .58 cent to 1.11 cent
higher, with February at 51.98 cents a gallon; and unleaded gas was
.18 cent to .55 cent lower, with February at 49.59 cents a gallon.

   The U.S. economy grew a healthy 3.8 percent in
1988, the best showing in four years, as the country benefited from
a narrowing of the trade deficit and a big increase in business
investment, the government reported Friday.
   The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure
of economic health, occurred despite the fact that growth slowed
sharply in the final three months of the year, with the GNP rising
at an annual rate of just 2.0 percent from October through December.
   The October-December increase was the slowest quarterly
performance in two years and followed increases of 3.4 percent, 3
percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, in the first three quarters
of 1988.
   While the fourth quarter performance came in below most advance
estimates, the figure was generally seen by economists and Wall
Street as a good sign that the economy was slowing to a more
sustainable pace.
   The stock market surged on the news, pushing the early-1989 rally
to new highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.79
to 2,322.86, capping off the best week so far in a rally that began
more than two months ago.
   Commenting on the GNP report, the Bush administration said that
the fourth-quarter slowdown was not a warning that the six-year
record peacetime recovery was in danger of coming to an end and
should not overshadow the stellar performance the economy turned in
for all of 1988. Immediately following the October 1987 stock market
crash, there were widespread fears that a cutback in spending by
worried consumers could topple the country into a recession.
   ``During 1988, we had a numer of positive developments,'' said
Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner. ``We made significant
progress in reducing the trade deficit, the unemployment rate
dropped to a 14-year low and the stock market began a sustained
recovery from its plunge in late 1987.''
   Ortner predicted that economic growth would be slower in 1989,
but he said the economy should be able to reach the 3.2 percent GNP
projection contained in President Reagan's final budget.
   The Bush administration has said it will use that same estimate
when it submits its budget revisions to Congress next month despite
criticism from private economists that this growth forecast is
overly optimistic.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said he was
looking for the economy to expand by just 2.7 percent in 1989 as a
slowdown in the trade improvement and slower business investment
holds back overall growth.
   Trade and business capital spending accounted for one-half of
overall growth in 1988 as exports shot up by 17.7 percent,
reflecting increased demand as the weaker dollar made U.S. products
competitive again.
   The surge in exports triggered a boom in spending on new plants
and equipment as U.S. industry rushed to expand production
facilities. Business investment shot up by 9.5 percent, the best
showing since 1984, and a big improvement over a 2.8 percent rise in
1987.
   However, in both the third quarter and fourth quarter the trade
deficit, as measured in inflation-adjusted terms in the GNP,
widened. Analysts said the trade improvement is in danger of
stalling out in 1989, an occurrence which would raise the danger the
country could topple into a recession.
   ``The trade numbers are very worrisome,'' Wyss said. ``When we
are still averaging a trade deficit of about $11 billion a month, we
can't afford to see the improvement stall out.''
   The 3.8 percent GNP increase for the year followed a 3.4 percent
rise in 1987. The faster growth helped push unemployment down to a
14-year low of 5.3 percent in December while pushing the factory
operating rate to 84.2 percent of capacity at the end of the year,
the highest level in nine years.
   However, the GNP report showed that inflation picked up as well
with a price index tied to the GNP rising by 4.2 percent last year,
the fastest increase since a 6.2 percent rise in 1982.
   For the fourth quarter, the GNP fixed-weighted price index rose
just 4 percent, down from a 5.3 percent increase in the third
quarter. But analysts said the Fed will likely consider the
inflation level still too high and keep up the pressure on interest
rates into the new year. This will boost the government's cost of
borrowing to finance the $2.7 trillion national debt and make it
even harder for Bush to fulfill his campaign pledge of lowering the
budget deficit without increasing taxes.
   But Bush on Friday played down any differences between the
administration and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``He is more concerned about inflation pressures than I am right
now,'' Bush said at a news conference. ``It seems to me there is an
area of difference. But generally speaking, I think we are fairly
close together.''
   The effects of last summer's drought lowered GNP growth by 0.4
percent for all of 1988, the Commerce Department said.
   The various changes left the GNP at $3.995 trillion for all of
1988 after removing the effects of inflation.
   The 3.8 percent GNP increase reflects the year-over-year change
in the economy. A different measurement just comparing economic
activity in the fourth quarter of 1988 with the same quarter in 1987
showed an increase of 2.7 percent.

   The dollar shot up Friday in foreign exchange
despite the intervention of central banks and the release of gross
national product figures that indicated a slowing U.S. economy,
currency traders said.
   Gold futures tumbled in reaction to the GNP figure, which reduced
inflationary fears, and to the dollar's strength.
   Traders said central banks intervened in the currency market at
least three times, but the dollar-selling did little to curb the
currency's upward price rise.
   ``After massive intervention there (still) was just too much
demand for the dollar,'' said Scott Horwitz, a currency trader for
Bank of Boston.
   Traders said the dollar dipped only briefly after the release of
the GNP figures, which showed the U.S. economy grew at an annual
rate of just 2.0 percent from October through December _ the slowest
quarterly GNP performance in two years.
   Horwitz said the lower-than-expected GNP figures and the
central-bank intervention ordinarily would dampen a rise in the
dollar, but they had little impact ``except to give those who buy
dollars the opportunity to buy dollars cheaper'' for a brief time.
   ``The foreign exchange market does not fully understand what's
going on,'' said Stephan Leach, a currency analyst with Chemical
Bank. ``I suspect that part of it may simply be that they (the
central banks) expected a different reaction to the GNP numbers.''
   He said many traders appeared to be waiting for the Bank of Japan
to enter the dollar-selling before they believed the central banks
were serious about their effort to halt the dollar's rise.
   In Tokyo, before the release of the GNP figure, the dollar closed
at 128.65 Japanese yen, up from 127.52 yen on Thursday. In London
late Friday the dollar traded at 128.93 yen, and later in New York
the dollar rose to 129.37 yen from 128.31 late Thursday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7655 late Friday from
Thursday's $1.7730. In New York, sterling fell to $1.759 from late
Thursday's $1.7672.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8650 West German marks, up from
1.8475; 1.5875 Swiss francs, up from 1.5705; 1.1834 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1849; 6.3357 French francs, up from 6.2832; and
1,364.5 Italian lire, up from 1,351.6.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Thursday's late rates included: 1.8570 West German marks, up from
1.8440; 1.5743 Swiss francs, up from 1.5671; 6.2875 French francs,
up from 6.2705; 2.0880 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,352.37
Italian lire, up from 1,350.25; and 1.1853 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1816.
   In London, gold closed at a bid of $398.25 a troy ounce, down
from $405.75 late Thursday. The late bid for gold was $398.75 an
ounce in Zurich, down from $405.75. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
closed at a bid of $403.99, down from $407.70.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $396.10 per troy ounce, down $6.90 in turbulent
trading from late Thursday.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold bullion at $402.25
an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up slightly from $402 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.02 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.19. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.883 an ounce from $6.104 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Junk-Bond Czar Nixes Deal From Prosecutors; No Negotiations Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors offered a plea bargain to senior
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. aide Michael Milken two weeks ago but he
spurned them, sources said Friday, in disclosing the first sign of
government willingness to negotiate a deal with the junk-bond
financier.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Milken's
lawyers immediately rejected the proposal from Manhattan U.S.
attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and vowed to battle it out in court if
Milken is indicted on charges of securities fraud and racketeering,
which have been expected for months.
   Milken's defense team, comprised of some the nation's best-known
attorneys, met with Giuliani aides at the prosecutor's request in
the U.S. attorney's office building, the sources said.
   Both sides declined to comment on the meeting, but some of the
sources suggested it is unusual for the government to initiate a
plea offer if prosecutors believe they have a strong, winnable case.
   It wasn't clear what kind of deal Giuliani offered, but there
were unconfirmed reports Milken would have to plead guilty to at
least two felony counts that carry a maximum punishment of five
years imprisonment each, pay an unspecified fine and be barred for
life from the securities business.
   The sources speculated that in any plea deal, Milken would have
served at least some prison time and cooperated in the government's
investigation of others. Those would include former close associates
and possibly his brother Lowell, another senior Drexel aide also
facing a possible indictment.
   Kenneth Lerer, a spokesman for Milken, issued a statement that
read: ``There are no discussions going on between the U.S.
attorney's office and Mike Milken's attorneys, no discussions
whatsoever. For the past 27 months, Mike's position has remained
unchanged. He will vigorously fight any charges brought against him
and his lawyers are preparing his defense.''
   Milken, 42, is known as the prime purveyor of sub-investment
grade debt securities known as junk bonds, a key factor in Drexel's
spectacular growth into an investment powerhouse this decade.
   He is considered one of the biggest targets in the massive Wall
Street fraud probe that stems largely from disclosures by
now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky, a notorious inside trader
and former Drexel client. Boesky claims Milken and the firm colluded
with him to violate a range of securities laws.
   The pressures on Milken to cooperate with the government in
return for lenient treatment have intensified since last month, when
Drexel buckled under Giuliani's threats of bringing a massive
racketeering case against the firm and left its top financier to
face the looming charges by himself.
   Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies, pay a record $650
million in fines and restitution, settle related litigation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and strengthen its compliance
with trading rules.
   Moreover papers unsealed in Manhattan federal court earlier this
week revealed Drexel will fire Milken if he's indicted and keep most
of his anticipated 1988 earnings, reportedly in the area of $200
million.
   Lawyers who have been following the Drexel saga differed on the
significance of Giuliani's offer to negotiate a plea deal with
Milken.
   Some said it reflected the politically ambitious prosecutor's
unwillingness to proceed with a complicated case that has an
uncertain future. Others said such contacts are common in
pre-indictment legal maneuvering.
   ``I wouldn't read much significance into this,'' said Michael
Feldberg, a former Giuliani aide who's now in private practice.
``It's not like a game of chicken where it matters who started it.''
   Of more concern to lawyers was Drexel's agreement to deny Milken
most of his pay from last year, even though he has yet to be charged
with a crime.
   ``I think that's outrageous,'' Feldberg said. ``...They have an
obligation to pay him the money. I don't know whether the guy did
anything wrong or not, but if he wants a day in court give it to
him.''
   John Stoppelman, a former SEC attorney who now practices
securities law in Washington, said he was happy to see Milken
intends to fight the charges.
   ``You might as well take your shot at trial. Thes cases have a
way of turning around,'' Stoppelman said. ``The guy is not Jack the
Ripper you know, they're not crimes against humanity. They're
regulatory in nature.''

<HEAD>Credit Markets Close Out Week With Price Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The credit markets wound up the week by making
further gains on Friday amid mounting confidence in the economy's
ability to grow at a non-inflationary pace.
   The benchmark issue, the Treasury's 30-year bond, rose 7-16
point, or $4.75 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, fell to 8.75 percent from 8.79 percent late
Thursday.
   Early in the session, bond prices rallied in reaction to a
government report showing economic activity slowed sharply in the
fourth quarter. A bit of profit-taking late in the day trimmed the
gains in bond prices slightly.
   The news that the gross national product grew at a 2 percent
annual rate in the final three months of the year reduced concerns
that rapid economic growth might induce the Federal Reserve Board to
raise interest rates to keep inflation from flaring up.
   The fourth-quarter pace in the GNP, the broadest measure of U.S.
economic activity, was the slowest one in two years.
   Jay Goldinger, market strategist at the Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based brokerage Capital Insight Inc., said bond traders were
able to take comfort from an array of positive news Friday.
   The dollar's persistent strength despite intervention by central
banks lately has propped up the credit markets, he said.
   A comment by President Bush at a news conference Friday
indicating he shares Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's views on the
economy and inflation also cheered bond traders who were worried
that the White House and the Fed may be at odds over policy,
Goldinger said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were up around [ point, intermediate maturities
rose about 7-32 point to 9-32 point, and long-term issues gained
7-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, increased 2.22 to 1,141.88.
   In corporate bond trading, industrials rose slightly. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, increased 0.39 to 299.76.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 5-32 point to 92 21-32. The average
yield to maturity declined to 7.63 percent from 7.64 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.57 percent as the
discount dropped 5 basis points to 8.31 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were unchanged at 8.82 percent as the discount edged up to
8.35 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.93 percent as the
discount dropped 5 basis points to 8.28 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 9[ percent, compared with 93-16
percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Smartfoods Sells Out To Frito-Lay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smartfoods Inc., a maker of cheddar cheese popcorn
that once boasted of its tiny size and developed an avid following
in New England, agreed to sell out to snack-food giant Frito-Lay
Inc. for $14.5 million, officials said Friday.
   Smartfoods shareholders voted overwhelmingly Thursday to sell
their shares in the privately held company, said Thomas Protheroe, a
Smartfoods distributor who provided the selling price. Neither
company would disclose the value of the deal.
   Smartfoods, which touts its ``all natural'' product in shiny
black-and-gold bags, will continue to operate unchanged, Frito-Lay
said.
   While Frito-Lay and Smartfoods officials said the deal would
bring a largely Northeastern product to a nationwide market,
distributors such as Protheroe were angry because Frito-Lay would be
taking over their lucrative distribution of the popcorn.
   ``We're finished,'' said Protheroe.
   Frito-Lay spokeswoman Beverly Holmes said in a telephone
interview that the buyout evolved from the desire of Smartfoods
officials to expand their distribution.
   ``We thought it was a very logical fit,'' Holmes said. ``We do
have a national distribution system. And obviously they have an
excellent product and a good marketing organization. We don't plan
to make any changes with the company.''
   Dallas-based Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of Pepsico Inc., had sales
of $3.7 billion last year. Smartfoods, based in the Boston suburb of
Marlboro, had sales of about $12 million in the past 12 months, said
spokeswoman Celia Gorlich.
   Smartfoods originally billed itself as the ``little guy.''
Smartfoods bags still carry the message: ``Instead of spending
millions on advertising like the junk food companies, we spend most

<HEAD>Newhouse Denies Rumors Newspaper for Sale</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES circulation figures in last graf; Also moved on general
newswires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumors that The Oregonian is for sale are
unfounded, the president of the newspaper's parent company said
Friday.
   ``The rumor has it that Times Mirror has bought The Oregonian or
that other groups have bought The Oregonian. It is totally untrue,''
Donald Newhouse, president of Advance Publications, said in a
telephone interview from Washington.
   Times Mirror publishes the Los Angeles Times and other daily
newspapers.
   Two local radio stations reported the rumor Thursday, along with
a denial issued by The Oregonian.
   Newhouse said there are no plans to sell the newspaper, ``not
even a thought about it.''
   ``I do not know where the rumor originated,'' he said. ``It just
has blossomed forth.''
   The Oregonian, Portland's only daily newspaper, has a daily
circulation of 317,711 and a Sunday circulation of 409,562.

<HEAD>Pepperell Says It Is Talking With Third Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. said Friday it
is talking with third parties interested in buying the textile
company, the target of a $1.4 billion hostile takeover attempt by
Farley Inc. of Chicago.
   In an amendment of its response to the Farley offer filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Pepperell said it continues
to maintain that the company is not for sale ``but is continuing to
review ... various financial alternatives to the offer.''
   ``The company has entered into preliminary negotiations with
various third parties who have expressed an interest in a
transaction involving the company ...,'' it said.
   West Point-based Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly held
textile company, is fighting Farley's takeover attempt in court.
   Today's announcement appears to be more than a simple search for
a ``white knight,'' or a buyer other than Farley, said Deborah
Bronston, a textile industry analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``They have said this before, but not in such a concrete way,''
she said. ``It leaves open the option that if they win in the
courts, they may not do anything. I think they have to come to the
special shareholders meeting Feb. 25 with a financial alternative
(to the Farley attempt), and so far they don't have one.''
   Farley has succeeded in forcing a shareholders meeting Feb. 25 at
which it will seek to replace Pepperell's directors with a new board
that would approve the Farley takeover.
   Ms. Bronston said it is unclear who the other potential buyers
might be, but she said Sam Walton, the owner of Wal-Mart stores and
one of the richest people in the United States, has been mentioned.
   ``I heard he was (in Georgia) having a grilled cheese with
someone recently, but it could have been just a store opening,'' she
said.
   Farley announced this week that, in addition to the 9.8 percent
of Pepperell stock it owns, it has been tendered about 52 percent of
the outstanding shares by Pepperell shareholders.
   Farley has filed a federal lawsuit contending that Georgia's
anti-takeover law unfairly hinders corporate takeovers by making
them virtually impossible. The hostile takeover of Pepperell depends
on revocation of the law, among other things.

<HEAD>Media General Earnings Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. reported a fourth-quarter
loss Friday and said 1988 earnings fell 79.4 percent, largely
because of costs associated with the sale of its broadcast services
business.
   The diversified communications company lost $29.6 million on
revenue of $191.4 million for the last three months of 1988, vs. a
profit of $11.4 million or 40 cents a share on revenue of $183.8
million a year earlier.
   For all of 1988, Media General said earnings totaled $8.81
million or 31 cents a share, down fro $42.9 million or $1.50 a share
in 1987. The drop came despite a 5.6 percent increase in revenues to
$755.7 million, up from $715.3 million in 1987.
   Most of the decline was attributed by the company to the sale of
its Broadcast Service operation to members of the unit's management,
resulting in a pretax charge of $54.9 million.
   James E. Evans, president and chief executive officer, said each
of the company's three major operations _ newspapers, broadcast and
newsprint _ participated in the revenue increase.
   ``In all, 1988 was a year in which Media General made important
progress in redefining the company's hard core businesses,'' Evans
said.

<HEAD>New York-Based Group Announces Tender Offer for IC Railroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Prospect Group launched a $440 million tender
offer Friday for Illinois Central Transportation Co., less than a
month after the railroad was spun off by Whitman Corp.
   IC's immediate reaction to the $20-a-share offer was cautious.
   ``There's so much going on right now that we can't say anything
beyond we're looking at it and we'll decide in the next couple of
days how to proceed,'' said IC spokesman Joe Fidanza.
   IC jumped to $22.37{ a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up
from $14.50 at Thursday's close.
   New York-based Prospect, which operates in the railroad,
insurance, and consumer products and services businesses through
subsidiaries, already owns 4.7 percent of IC's 21.7 million
outstanding shares.
   Also Friday, grain giant Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. announced it
intended to increase its IC holdings _ for investment purposes only
_ from about 10 percent to at least 15 percent, and perhaps as high
as 25 percent.
   ``The railroad provides a good connection between Chicago and New
Orleans and it carries a lot of chemicals and grain,'' said Linda
Dunn, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   IC Transportation Co., known formerly as the Illinois Central
Gulf Railroad, runs freight operations and leases track for some
passenger services over 2,850 miles in seven states _ Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana.
   The railroad was spun off Jan. 1 after an infusion of $180
million in equity by parent Whitman Corp., a Chicago-based
conglomerate previously known as IC Industries.
   IC last year had net income of $47.7 million on revenue of $556.4
million. Any acquirer would also inherit about $260 million in
long-term debt.
   Prospect bought 400 miles of track from the Illinois Central Gulf
Co. in May 1986 and renamed it MidSouth. After expanding to about
1,200 miles through other acquisitions, the line became one of the
nation's most profitable railroads.
   ``MidSouth was one of those successes that dazzles and that's
what encouraged us to go ahead on this one,'' said Prospect
spokesman Donald Dwight. ``MidSouth already has done a lot of
business with the IC, many of the customers are the same and
Prospect just feels it would like to take that experience and step
into a larger arena.''
   One of the customers in common is Decatur, Ill.-based ADM.
   ADM is one of IC's 10 largest customers. The company also owns a
fleet of more than 1,400 barges and 19 towboats, and its heightened
interest in the railroad may stem from the low water levels on the
Mississippi River caused by last summer's drought and the
possibility of continued problems on the commercial waterway.

<TEXT>
   Share prices rose sharply in extremely heavy
trading Friday on London's Stock Exchange as a favorable British
trade report fueled already positive investor sentiment.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 46.1 points, or 2.4 percent, at 2,005.9.
   The high point came at midafternoon, when the index moved up 57.6
points.
   Britain's merchandise deficit narrowed to $2.23 billion in
December from a revised $3.31 billion in November, the government
said.
   The financial markets had expected the December deficit to total
$2.64 billion.
   The trade figures provided further evidence that Britain's
economic growth was slowing, helping to increase hopes that the next
move in interest rates might be downward, dealers said.
   ``The market has put in quite an exceptional performance,'' said
Bill Smith, an equity market strategist at Prudential-Bache Capital
Funding Ltd.
   As in recent sessions, trading opened on a tentative note, with
the 100-share index up just 5.5 points, amid near disbelief at the
market's virtually unhindered rise in recent weeks.
   Since the beginning of the year, the 100-share index has gained
11.9 percent.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed with a gain of
39.7 points at 1,641.0.
   The Financial Times 500 share index was at 1129.38, up 25.36.
   Volume surged to 1.17 billion shares from Thursday's volume of
624.5 million shares.

   The stock market capped off a week of big gains
with another strong advance Friday in the heaviest trading in seven
months.
   Analysts said investors, especially professional money managers,
continued to scramble after stocks to get aboard an unexpectedly
sharp and durable rally dating back to late November.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.79 to
2,322.86, bringing its gain for the week to 87.50 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, as 929
issues closed higher in price, 611 lower and 467 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 254.87 million
shares, up from 212.25 million Thursday and the heaviest total since
a 264.41 million-share day last June 27.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 299.97 million shares.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that
the U.S. gross national product grew at a annual rate of 2 percent,
after adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street,
and provided a fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy
was slowing to a sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace.
   Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term
government bonds. That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an
advance in stock prices that has already been gathering steam of
late.
   Brokers said a strong dollar in foreign exchange also helped stir
up investors' enthusiasm for stocks.
   Hopes for a return of individual investors in significant numbers
sparked broad gains in stocks of brokerage firms that rely heavily
on dealings with the public.
   Merrill Lynch gained 1| to 29~; A.G. Edwards 1} to 22];
PaineWebber 1[ to 18[; Quick &amp; Reilly 1[ to 14~, and Charles Schwab
} to 10.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose { to 48\;
Ford Motor 1 to 52|; International Business Machines ~ to 126~;
Merck 1] to 65, and General Electric { to 47].
   West Point-Pepperell jumped 3] to 49~. The company said it was
looking into alternatives to a takeover bid by Farley Inc.
   Apple Computer tumbled 3} to 38 as by far the most active issue
in the over-the-counter market. The company said earnings for its
second fiscal quarter ending March 30 are expected to fall to the
range of 35 to 45 cents a share from 61 cents a share in the
comparable period last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $20.51 billion, or 0.72
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.18 to 164.78.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.31 to 339.55, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 2.13 at 293.82.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.87 to 397.96. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 321.57, up .15.
