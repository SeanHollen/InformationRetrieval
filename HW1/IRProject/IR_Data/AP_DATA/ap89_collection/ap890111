<HEAD>Energy Choice an Authority on Nuclear Warfare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James David Watkins, the former naval commander
reportedly chosen by George Bush to head the Energy Department, is
an authority on nuclear warfare who will put that expertise to work
trying to clean up the nation's crumbling atomic weapons plants.
   Watkins, whom CBS said has been picked to be Energy Secretary,
will take over an agency charged with overseeing the
multibillion-dollar renovation of the nation's aging and
increasingly unsafe complex of plants that build nuclear warheads.
   Watkins ended his 41-year Navy career in 1986 after a four-year
stint as the chief of naval operations, the service's top officer.
But within a year, the former nuclear submarine commander had
stepped into a new hot seat.
   In October 1987, President Reagan picked Watkins to head the
presidential commission that was supposed to tell Reagan what the
nation should do about AIDS.
   Watkins, used to command, jumped in with authority, guided the
panel through exhaustive hearings and led it to a series of widely
praised recommendations.
   Watkins was born March 7, 1927, in Alhambra, Calif., near the Los
Angeles harbor. His mother was Louis Ward Watkins, who ran
unsuccessfully in 1938 for the Republican nomination to California's
Senate seat, one of the few women at the time who sought national
office.
   He later recalled that his mother used to take him and his
brother down to nearby Navy ports to watch the big ships come and
go. She sometimes arranged to get the three of them aboard the
ships, where they dined with officers and heard tales about life on
the high seas.
   It was those stories _ and the ships _ that helped convince
Watkins he wanted a life in the Navy. He entered the Naval Academy
in 1945, just as World War II was winding down.
   Following his graduation four years later, Watkins served aboard
destroyers and submarines, earned a master's degree at the Naval
Postgraduate School, and then made a decision that helped steer the
course of his career.
   Watkins went into nuclear submarines, where he came under the
aegis of Adm. Hyman Rickover, the father of the modern nuclear Navy
and the man who played a key role in the careers of dozens of Navy
leaders in the post-World War II era.
   After completing the nuclear reactor engineering course at the
Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory, Watkins took command of the
nuclear-powered attack sub Snook.
   Watkins steered the Snook into the harbor at Yokosuka, Japan, the
first visit of a nuclear-powered ship to the only nation which has
been the target of nuclear attack. More than 5,000 demonstrators
greeted the ship.
   Watkins rose within the Navy's ranks and became commander of the
Pacific Fleet, based in Honolulu. He was in that post in March 1982
when Reagan picked him as chief of naval operations.
   In that post, Watkins helped oversee the big naval buildup, from
450 to nearly 600 ships, that was at the heart of Reagan's defense
budget during the president's first term.
   Watkins and his wife of 38 years, Sheila Jo, have raised six
children.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will visit
President-elect George Bush in Washington early next month, less
than two weeks after Bush's inauguration, Japanese news reports said
today.
   During his five-day trip starting Jan. 31, Takeshita is also
scheduled to meet with outgoing President Reagan at his California
home, the reports said.
   A Foreign Ministry official said ``discussions are under way''
regarding the trip and an exact itinerary, but declined to confirm
details.
   Takeshita had originally planned to travel to Washington earlier
this month but canceled the trip because of the deteriorating health
of Emperor Hirohito, who died Saturday of intestinal cancer at age
87.
   Takeshita is scheduled to leave for the United States on Jan. 31,
meet with Bush the next day and return home Feb. 4, said Asahi
Shimbun, a major Japanese daily.
   Bush is to be inaugurated Jan. 20.

<HEAD>28 Killed By Shining Path, 200 Arrested In Rebel-Organized Campus
Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shining Path rebels killed 11 policemen in a
cocaine-producing jungle valley, and Lima police arrested 200
students in a protest instigated by the Maoist guerrilla group,
authorities said.
   The two weekend ambushes by the Shining Path in the Huallaga
Valley, where about 60 percent of the world's coca crop is grown,
also wounded 11 people, the government paper La Cronica reported
Tuesday.
   The deaths brought the insurgency toll since Saturday to 28
killed.
   In Lima, dozens of heavily armed riot police swept onto the San
Marcos University campus on Tuesday, police said, arresting 200
students who were blocking nearby streets with rocks and bonfires
and exploding dynamite charges.
   Police reported no injuries in the protest, one of dozens at San
Marcos over the past year.
   Witnesses said the disturbance was sparked by recent austerity
measures, but officials said Shining Path supporters were behind the
campus violence.
   The weekend deaths come amid a recent spurt of violence in the
Shining Path insurgency, which has claimed 12,000 victims since
fighting began in 1980. La Cronica said separate guerrillas columns
hiding in the dense jungle opened fire on passing patrol vehicles
with automatic weapons and hand grenades.
   Seven policemen were slain on a jungle road 20 miles northwest of
Tingo Maria, 240 miles northeast of Lima, and four policemen died in
an ambush near Polvora, 100 miles north of Tingo Maria, La Cronica
said.
   There were no reports of rebel casualties or word on whether
police were able to return the gunfire.
   Officials said the region has become a no-man's land overrun by
drug traffickers and Maoist guerrillas who provide the traffickers
protection in exchange for funds to buy weapons.
   Peruvian coca is usually processed into a semi-refined state and
smuggled into Colombia, where it is turned into pure cocaine for
sale in U.S. and European markets, according to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   The Huallaga Valley, Ayacucho and Apurimac are among eight states
currently under states of emergency, giving the military broad
policing and governing powers to counter the rebels.

<TEXT>
   A relative of a Mafia informant whose
testimony has helped put hundreds of people behind bars has been
shot to death in an apparent underworld vendetta, police said.
   Sebastino Lombardo, 41, was gunned down Tuesday as he was driving
home on the outskirts of Palermo. It was not immediately known how
many people were involved in the attack.
   Lombardo was thebrother-in-law of Salvatore ``Totuccio''
Contorno, a Mafioso-turned-informant whose testimony helped convict
338 defendants in the Mafia trial that ended in December 1987 and
was Italy's largest ever.
   One of Contorno's brothers, Giuseppe, was murdered in Sicily last
September. The shooting came a month after Contorno testified before
Italian magistrates, who questioned him in the United States to
prepare another mass Mafia trial.
   Police blamed the Mafia for both slayings.
   One investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
not clear if the Mafia targeted Contorno's relatives out of pure
revenge or because they were suspected of being his own informers.
   Last month, Italy's state television broadcast an interview with
Contorno that was conducted at an undisclosed location in the United
States. In the interview, Contorno assessed the current state of the
Mafia and spoke of its connections with judges and politicians.
   After Tomasso Buscetta, Contorno is considered the state's star
witness against the Sicilian Mafia.
   As part of a deal for helping the Americans in the ``Pizza
Connection'' heroin investigation, the 42-year-Contorno receives
$1,300 a month and is moved from location to location under the U.S.
government's witness protection program.

   The nuclear power plant in an earthquake-prone area
of Soviet Armenia will be closed by March, Soviet television
reported.
   The Vremya evening news program reported Tuesday night that one
of the plant's reactors would shut down by Feb. 25, the second by
March 18.
   The plant, located in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, was not
damaged by the devastating Dec. 7 earthquake in another part of the
small southern Soviet republic that borders Turkey.
   But officials began to take environmentalists' concern over the
plant's hazardous location more seriously after that quake, which
killed at least 25,000 people.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov said in December that the plant would
close within two years due to the earthquake danger.

<TEXT>
   Three British mine-sweepers which have been part of
a task force helping to clear mines from the Persian Gulf will head
home in early March, said Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton.
   The decision was made because of the Aug. 20 cease-fire that
halted fighting in the 8-year war between Iran and Iraq, the absence
of any recent mining, and achievements of European and U.S.
mine-sweepers in removing mines from international waters, Hamilton
said Tuesday night.
   A four-ship task force of high-technology British Hunt Class
mine-hunters arrived in the gulf in September 1987, following
Iranian mining of the area. Since then, the Royal Navy has located
and destroyed 10 mines.
   Hamilton said that should circumstances change, Britain would
return three mine-hunters to the gulf.
   Britain's Armilla Patrol of three destroyers or frigates will
remain in the gulf and the Indian Ocean area to provide assurance
and protection, if necessary, to British shipping, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's parting shot on the
savings and loan crisis _ a recommendation to curtail deposit
insurance _ landed with a thud on Capitol Hill and at the
president's own Treasury Department.
   Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, who will remain in
the administration of President-elect Bush, moved swiftly to disavow
the proposal, which came Tuesday in a report to Congress by the
White House Council of Economic Advisers.
   Brady is formulating the next administration's plan for the S&amp;L
industry, in which a post-Depression record of 205 institutions were
closed last year.
   Until now he's refused to release any details of the work in
progress, but the White House suggestion prompted him to make a rare
disclosure. In a statement released through Rep. Chalmers Wylie of
Ohio, the ranking Republican on the committee, Brady denied
emphatically the administration is even considering reducing the
$100,000 limit on insured accounts.
   News of the Reagan report reached the House Banking Committee on
Tuesday, in the middle of a six-hour hearing on the S&amp;L problem, and
provoked an outcry.
   ``I think its wrong to even discuss limiting the insurance,''
said Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md.
   The Reagan report did not suggest how much the insurance limit
should be reduced, nor did it say if the reduction should apply to
existing deposits, or just to new deposits.
   Most depositors would be unaffected, even by a sharp reduction.
According to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, a trade group,
the average S&amp;L account at the end of 1987 had $8,440.
   Nevertheless, Congress is extraordinarily sensitive about
anything that might spook depositors into withdrawing their money _
all that really keeps insolvent S&amp;Ls afloat is Congress' word that
it will stand behind the deposits.
   ``I'm appalled at the timing of the administration. ... I think
the public needs some reassurance,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which itself has
been technically insolvent since 1986, simply does not have the cash
to pay off depositors in failed institutions. Instead, it has been
wiping out failed S&amp;Ls' losses by issuing promissory notes, pledging
income the fund expects to receive in the future.
   Congress is looking at ways to pump more money into the insurance
fund, and most private analysts believe it will have to turn to the
taxpayer.
   The Council of Economic Advisers acknowledged that deposit
insurance, provided by the government ever since the wave of bank
failures in the 1930s, discourages bank runs and provides poor and
middle-class people with a safe place for their money.
   But it ``also dramatically reduces the incentives for depositors
to monitor the financial health of their bank,'' the report said.
Because insured depositors don't care how well their institution is
run, bank officers have less incentive to manage wisely, it argued.
   Lowering the insurance limit ``would restore much-needed
discipline to the system,'' it said.
   Regulators are leery of reducing the limit because a run by a few
big-money depositors is just as damaging, if not more damaging, than
a run of many small depositors.
   They fear that if a run causes a bank or S&amp;L failure,
particularly at a big bank holding deposits for smaller
institutions, it could trigger a chain reaction, possibly causing a
general financial collapse.
   But many industry officials maintain that a lower insurance limit
would have little effect, good or bad. Currently, depositors with
millions of dollars, who want it all insured, use a broker. A
computer splits the money into chunks of less than $100,000 and
parcels it out to as many institutions as necessary. A computer
could just as easily split the money into $50,000 pieces, or even
$10,000 pieces.
   ``The real impact would simply be to inconvenience people,'' said
Mark Clark, an executive vice president with the U.S. League.
   A suggestion sometimes offered as a way to plug that loophole is
limiting depositors to only one insured account. But, Federal Home
Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the rule would be
extremely difficult to enforce.
   The Internal Revenue Service, which keeps track of deposit
accounts to make sure tax is being paid on interest earned, hasn't
been able to obtain Social Security numbers necessary to monitor all
of the accounts, despite an intensive effort, Wall said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Cabinet Male, White, Establishment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's Cabinet is emerging as nearly all
male, all Republican establishment, but women and conservatives are
holding their fire.
   Bush's honeymoon period is quite a contrast to eight years ago
when conservatives voiced outrage over several of Ronald Reagan's
Cabinet choices.
   The Reagan transition was marked by regular denunciations by
conservatives of such Cabinet choices as Donald T. Regan for
treasury secretary and Malcolm Baldrige for commerce secretary.
   No such outcry has greeted the Bush Cabinet although most of the
choices are no more acceptable to conservatives. The only Bush
Cabinet appointee to rank as a conservative hero is former Rep. Jack
Kemp, the choice to head the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Craig Shirley, a conservative consultant who backed Bush for the
GOP presidential nomination, said there is a mixed response to the
emerging administration.
   ``Some are very delighted because Bush struck conservative themes
during the campaign and he hasn't changed on any of those,'' he
said. ``Others are taking more of a wait-and-see attitude and then
there are the historical Bush-bashers.''
   One of the longtime Bush bashers is Richard Viguerie, a
conservative fund-raiser, who was an early and outspoken critic of
Reagan Cabinet choices.
   ``The consensus (among conservatives) is, this is not the time,
let's wait,'' said Viguerie. ``There is nothing to be gained by
going out there and pounding the table now.''
   Viguerie was less restrained than many of his conservative allies
and he described the Bush appointments as ``very disillusioning,
discouraging and disappointing.''
   Throughout his campaign and since winning the presidency, Bush
has emphasized his desire to reach out and bring into government
people ``who are too often overlooked.''
   If by that he meant women, so far, he has fallen short.
   ``I keep being told, give it time,'' said Nancy Thompson, a
Republican consultant who was a Bush delegate to the 1988 Republican
National Convention.
   ``I've got my fingers crossed.''
   Thompson and Susan McLane, a Republican state senator in New
Hampshire, chose to praise the women Bush has chosen rather than
bemoan those left out.
   Both cited the selection of Elizabeth Dole to head the Labor
Department and Carla Hills to be trade representative as encouraging
choices.
   But McLane conceded that women appear still to be at a stage
where they must be satisfied with one or two high-visibility jobs in
an administration.
   ``I think we are still at that age,'' she said.
   As for the president-elect's attitude toward appointing women,
she said, ``I don't think George Bush has thought about it that much
and he hasn't thought about it as something important.''
   ``There are only a very few of those top, top spots,'' said
Thompson. ``And to have two _ one and a half, if you will (Hills
would have Cabinet status but not run a full department) that are
that visible, that's good.''
   Thompson said she expected to see far more women in the next
round of appointments.
   ``I'm waiting for this second cut. I believe that's where we're
going to find some names.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, a strong Bush supporter from the
earliest stages of the presidential campaign, was on many lists of
potential Cabinet appointees.
   ``My name was being thrown around a lot, not necessarily to my
benefit,'' she said. ``The fact is he never asked me to serve in his
Cabinet and I don't know if I would have or could have. ... I think
there was an assumption I was talking to him every day and it just
wasn't so.''
   Martin, who denied any personal disappointment, said, ``I know he
has asked again and again for the group around him to give him the
names of more women, of more Hispanics or more blacks.''
   ``I believe we're going to see a lot of women,'' she added. ``And
if we don't, the shoe drops.''

<HEAD>Bush Says He'll Aid Public Schools As Much As Possible</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who would be education president says
he'll push certain public school reforms and provide whatever aid he
can in ``tough budgetary times'' to districts trying to improve
their schools.
   ``I do want to help,'' President-elect Bush told educators
Tuesday at a White House workshop on experiments that give parents
wide freedom to select their children's public schools.
   ``I do intend to provide every feasible assistance to states, to
districts interested in further experimentation with choice plans
and other valuable reforms,'' Bush said. ``I will ask the Department
of Education to monitor and focus continued attention on the need
for future progress, and I'll be a spokesman and advocate for
further public school improvements.''
   Bush said he is particularly enthusiastic about having parents
and students being able to choose their public schools, calling the
prevailing system of assigned schools a trap and their students
``captive clients.''
   ``It's a system that can perpetuate mediocrity,'' he said. ``Poor
schools have no incentives to improve.''
   Supporters of choosing schools say it makes schools more
competitive and responsive, improves morale and attendance, reduces
disciplinary problems and dropouts, and improves learning among
students.
   President Reagan, addressing the workshop earlier in the day,
cited the examples of ``a Harlem school district in which scores
have risen dramatically because parents are now permitted to choose
which school to send their children to'' and a Minnesota program
``that is fostering unprecedented competition among public schools
to make them more attractive to parents and students.''
   Referring to the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education in
1954 that integrated public schools, Bush said it is now time to
focus on what goes on inside those doors.
   ``Quality education has become a central civil rights question of
our time,'' he said. ``And too often today it is our disadvantaged
children who are most likely to be burdened by inadequate public
education.''
   Bush said that for choice to work, teachers and principals need
greater autonomy and authority, while parents need better
publicized, more reliable performance evaluations of schools.
   The heads of the nation's two teacher unions both attended the
workshop and said they were encouraged by the emphasis on
strengthening public schools, as opposed to giving needy parents
public money to send their kids to private schools _ a recurring
Reagan administration theme.
   ``I didn't hear anything about vouchers or tuition tax credits
and those would be the red flags for us,'' said Mary Futrell,
president of the National Education Association.
   ``To the extent you increase public school choice, you decrease
pressure for vouchers and tuition tax credits,'' added Albert
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers.

   In a round of layoffs dubbed ``The Tuesday
Massacre'' by a Justice Department spokesman, more than 20
department employees including some career public affairs officers
were fired in an effort to save money.
   ``I don't think they gave any thought to how the work would get
done,'' laid-off spokesman Thomas Stewart said Tuesday. ``It's such
a clownish performance to take all the press officers out of the
press office and tell the director to run it with what's left.''
   The public affairs office, currently served by 10 spokesmen who
handle hundreds of phone calls from reporters each day, will be left
with four after the layoffs take effect Feb. 10. Of those four,
three will be political appointees.
   Ten people from the office of legislative affairs also are losing
their jobs, said Thomas Boyd, assistant attorney general in charge
of that office.
   The 21 people being laid off receive annual salaries and benefits
totaling $955,983, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, deputy director of
public affairs. Of that, the public affairs employees represent
$613,392 and the legislative affairs workers represent $342,501.
   Burstion-Wade, who will keep her job, denied that the layoffs
were politically motivated and added, ``Anytime you have a budget
crunch, you have to make some tough decisions.''
   Loye Miller, public affairs director, said he was surprised by
the layoffs when Thornburgh's staff informed him Tuesday morning,
even though he knew the Office of Management and Budget was planning
cutbacks.
   Miller and Boyd said their offices had been overstaffed and
underfunded, according to budget authorization levels. As a result,
money had been transferred from other areas to pay for them.

   A federal judge on Tuesday issued a permanent
injunction barring members of an anti-abortion group from
obstructing or harassing anyone seeking services at clinics in the
metropolitan area that provide abortions.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Ward granted the order against
Operation Rescue, which is based in upstate Binghamton, at the
request of lawyers for various women's groups and clinics, which had
sued last April.
   Ward ordered that if the injunction is violated, a $25,000 fine
will be imposed against the organization on the first day and
doubled for each additional day it is violated.
   The injunction does not preclude members of Operation Rescue from
protesting on sidewalks outside abortion facilities.
   The order does bar them from trespassing on the grounds of
clinics in New York and suburban Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester
counties or obstructing people from entering the buildings. It also
prohibits members from physically abusing or harassing anyone who
seeks services or works at the clinics.
   Michael Tierney, an attorney for Operation Rescue, said he had
not seen the order and could not comment.
   David Cole, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights,
which represented the plaintiffs, said the judge had previously
issued two temporary restraining orders against members of Operation
Rescue.
   The first was in response to a week-long demonstration by the
group last May and a second for demonstrations planned in October,
according to Cole.
   Ward imposed a $50,000 fine against Operation Rescue for
demonstrations actually carried out at two clinics in May. The fine
has not yet been paid, he said.
   Cole said his clients asked for a permanent injunction when they
learned that Operation Rescue had planned another series of protests
for Jan. 12-14 in the metropolitan area.
   The plaintiffs include the National Organization for Women and
several clinics in the area, he said.

   Former Beatle Ringo Starr trades his yellow
submarine for a blue train conductor's hat in a new children's
television program.
   ``Shining Time Station'' makes its debut on PBS later this month.
To promote the program, Starr arrived here Tuesday on a train from
Chicago with his wife, Barbara Bach, and his co-stars Brian O'Connor
and Nicole Leach.
   In the program, Starr plays an 18-inch-tall conductor who
narrates the train tales.
   ``It's great to be 18 inches tall again,'' the full-sized Starr
told reporters in Chicago on Monday as they watched a video version
of his character, Mr. Conductor.
   The 20 half-hour segments are aimed at children ages 3 through 7.
   Each segment includes two animated four-minute train sequences.
They have run since 1984 on British television under the name
``Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.''
   Starr deflected questions about his recent stay at a
substance-abuse treatment center. Asked if he could talk about his
problems with drugs, Starr answered, ``Yes, I won.''

   Former teen-age Olympic star Mary Lou Retton is
taking two bowling industry groups to court in a contract dispute
related to the fact that she's not a kid anymore.
   The gymnast and her family are suing the two trade groups in U.S.
District Court for $250,000, alleging the organizations unfairly
ended a four-year promotional agreement that began in 1985.
   Last June, the trade groups notified Retton and her family that
the agreement was being halted, the suit says, ``on the ground that
Mary Lou Retton, due to changes in her physical image caused by her
maturing as a woman, was no longer a suitable spokesperson.'' The
court papers did not elaborate.
   The suit, filed Monday, alleges breach of the agreement.
   Retton, of Fairmont, W.Va., as a 16-year-old captured the
all-around gold medal in women's gymnastics at the 1984 Summer
Olympic Games.
   A secretary at the National Bowling Council Inc. of Washington
said Tuesday that the group's spokesman was out sick for the day.
Connie Kerr, a spokeswoman for the Bowling Proprietors Association
of America of Arlington, Texas, said she wasn't aware the suit had
been filed and had no other immediate comment.

   A vast majority of Americans support programs
to help the chronically poor, according to a survey released today
by a civil rights group.
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund also said it found
further erosion in opposition to busing to achieve school
integration.
   ``The survey demonstrates that the public is primed for
presidential action and leadership on race relations issues,'' said
Elaine Jones, deputy director-counsel of the fund.
   The survey found that 93 percent of whites and 95 percent of
blacks favored special school programs beginning at age 8 to
motivate poor youngsters to stay in school and not drop out.
   Ninety percent of whites and 95 percent of blacks favored federal
youth corps camps where poor young people could learn to read and
write and attain other skills. Similar majorities supported business
incentives to provide jobs in poor neighborhoods.
   Among blacks, 79 percent said the best long-term way to combat
crime was not ``to spend large sums of money sending criminals to
prison and keeping them there a long time'' but to ``spend the same
money attacking the causes of crime, such as reducing poverty,
keeping young people in school and motivating young people to
succeed rather than become criminals.'' Among whites, 81 percent
agreed.
   The civil rights group said the poll was taken June 3 through
Sept. 12 by Louis Harris and Associates and based on interviews with
more than 3,000 people. The report was unclear as to the margin of
error.
   According to the survey, 57 percent of whites remained opposed to
busing children to achieve school integration but 67 percent of
blacks remained in favor of it. Among all Americans, it was favored
by 54 percent.
   Until two years ago, opposition among all Americans had remained
a consistent 78 percent for three decades.
   The survey was accompanied by a separate study documenting
conditions among the black poor. Eighty-six percent of single
mothers surveyed received no funds from their families or the
government to pay for child care. Just 11 percent said they received
federal or state housing subsidies.
   Sixteen percent reported having private health insurance,
compared with 60 percent among all Americans.
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. is a separate
and distinct organization from the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. Founded in 1940s, the New York-based
group has played a major role in many of the battles or the civil
rights era.

<HEAD>Bank To Pay Record $14 Million In Sex, Race Bias Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women and minorities who worked for a major
Chicago bank from 1973 to 1988 will share a record $14 million in
back pay the bank agreed to pay in settling a race and sex bias case
dating to 1977.
   Harris Trust and Savings Bank and the Labor Department announced
the settlement Tuesday, ending an 11-year legal battle in which an
administrative law judge twice ruled against the institution. A
Chicago group that intervened on behalf of some bank workers
estimated that about 5,000 current and former Harris employees are
eligible for a share of the settlement.
   Harris said it would put the money in an escrow account in
another bank. The government is responsible for finding the workers
and determining how much back pay to award them.
   The bank said it was not admitting to any wrongdoing but was
settling the case to avoid ``more legal and statistical wrangling.''
   Under the agreement, Harris Trust must revise its affirmative
action policies, set up training programs for women and minorities
seeking promotions to professional and managerial posts, and tell
the department periodically over the next three years how well it is
complying with the agreement and anti-discrimination laws.
   The agreement did not set any quotas or goals for the bank to
meet.
   The Labor Department in 1977 charged that Harris Trust was
discriminating by promoting white men at a higher rate than women
and minorities with comparable skills and was paying the white men
more for comparable work.
   Four years later, a Labor Department administrative law judge
ruled that Harris Trust had discriminated against women and
minorities in a number of areas. The judge awarded $12.2 million in
back pay.
   But then-Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan set aside the decision,
saying the bank wrongly had been denied an opportunity to present
statistical studies in its defense.
   The case was reheard and in 1986 the judge again ruled the bank
was liable for back pay to women and minority employees on its
payroll from 1974 to Dec. 22, 1986, unless it could prove it ceased
the discriminatory practices before that date.
   The settlement announced Tuesday expanded that period to cover
women and minorities in the bank's employ at any time from May 1973
to December 1988.
   The Labor Department's solicitor, George R. Salem, said the
settlement ``represents a major step forward, not only for the
present and former employees of the Harris bank who will benefit
from it but also for all women and minority group workers in the
American labor force.''
   But B. Kenneth West, chairman and chief executive officer of
Harris Trust, said that ending the matter was ``a pure business
decision'' made ``not because we believe we are guilty but because
the administrative process for a defendant is lengthy,
time-consuming, costly and frustrating.''
   ``The time has come to put this matter behind us,'' he said.
   Harris Trust, with assets of $11.7 billion, reported employing
3,967 workers as of Dec. 28, 1988. Of them, 59.8 percent were women
and 33.7 percent minorities, with some overlap.
   West, in the bank's statement, said Harris Trust expected to
report within weeks record earnings for 1988 and would charge the
``majority'' of the settlement expenses to its 1988 operations. He
was not more specific.
   Salem said $14 million was the largest back pay award ever
obtained by the department in a case involving alleged sex or race
discrimination. The previous record was $10 million, he said.

<HEAD>Program To Reclaim Erodible Land Should Do Well Under Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-range program that lets farmers take
fragile land out of crop production is turning into the Agriculture
Department's main showcase for soil and water conservation programs.
   Moreover, because the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, has
had strong bipartisan support in Congress, there is a reasonably
good chance that the program's spending blueprint offered by
President Reagan may fare well when the Bush administration takes
over.
   The CRP was authorized by Congress in the 1985 farm law and had
the support of many environmental, conservation and agricultural
groups.
   Under the plan, farmers can contract with USDA to take highly
erodible land from crop production for 10 years. In return, they get
initial federal assistance in establishing protective soil cover of
grass or trees, and then receive annual rental payments for the term
of the contract.
   The goal of Congress was to get 40 million to 45 million acres in
CRP by the end of 1990. Seven signups have been held so far, the
most recent in July and August, and an eighth is scheduled for Feb.
6-24.
   Thus far, CRP has about 28.2 million acres enrolled.
   According to President Reagan's final budget sent to Congress
this week, the CRP is firmly entrenched as the USDA's premier _ and
most costly _ conservation program.
   Overall, the department's soil and water programs are expected to
operate at the level of almost $2.7 billion in the fiscal year that
will begin Oct. 1, about the same as this year.
   That includes $632 million for Soil Conservation Service
technical assistance and other programs, and more than $2 bilion for
the CRP, which is handled by the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service.
   A USDA budget report said erosion has been reduced by more than
90 percent on land already enrolled in the long-term program.
   ``Over 1.7 million acres of trees have been planted,'' the report
said. ``And, if the current trends continue, the CRP will likely
become the largest publicly sponsored tree-planting program in the
nation's history.''
   Stephen B. Dewhurst, the department's budget director, said the
Reagan budget plan ``provides enough funding to go to the 40 million
acre level'' of land idling in the coming fiscal year and that
``there is enough money in this budget to keep the CRP on track.''
   Although CRP is the biggest gun in the department's conservation
arsenal, there are other important programs that concern the
nation's soil and water resources.
   For example, the Reagan budget would continue Soil Conservation
Service, or SCS, soil surveys at the level of $68.7 million in 1990,
and snow surveys at $5.5 million. The snow surveys are important for
gauging how much water will be available from snowmelt in the West.
   Watershed planning and construction is another major item at
$103.9 million, although that would be down from $181 million
currently.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold an additional 360,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat
to China at subsidized prices.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Tuesday the wheat was part of 1
million tons authorized Dec. 30 for China under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Under the EEP arrangement, exporters can sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. Exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   The wheat sales were handled by five companies: Continental Grain
Co., 40,000 tons; Entrade International Ltd., 30,000; Central States
Enterprises Inc., 50,000; Ferruzzii USA Inc., 100,000; and Louis
Dreyfus Corp., 140,000.
   Sims said the wheat was sold for March shipment and will carry an
average subsidy rate of $22.79 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel.
   Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements,
China has 210,000 tons still available under the program.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 360,000 tons of wheat would be about 13.2 million
bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $4.09 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $54 million.

   The Agriculture Department has expanded the
long-range Conservation Reserve Program so that certain farmed
wetlands and other highly erodible land subject to damage from
occasional flooding can be signed up.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said Tuesday the lands will be eligible for
CRP only if farmed in two of the five crop years 1981 through 1985.
   To be eligible, the land ``must be scoured by erosion caused by
out-of-bank water flows which can be expected to flood at least once
every 10 years,'' he said.
   The deparment's Soil Conservation Service estimates there were
more than four million acres of wetlands used for crops in 1982.
Most of the land is in the North Central states or in the flood
plains of the Mississippi and other major rivers.
   Land put into the program must be planted to trees or other
approved vegetative cover. In return, farmers can collect federal
assistance to establish the protective cover and get annual rental
payments for 10 years.
   The next signup for CRP will be Feb. 6-24. More than 28 million
acres have been enrolled so far. The goal is to have at least 40
million acres of highly erodible land in the program by the end of
1990.

   A modern Soviet composer will help Carnegie Hall
celebrate its centennial as a reminder that a compatriot _ Peter
Ilich Tchaikovsky _ was at the hall when it opened.
   Carnegie Hall's centennial will be celebrated during the entire
1990-91 season and will be highlighted by a series of world
premieres, Carnegie President Isaac Stern said Tuesday.
   Carnegie Hall made its debut on May 5, 1891, with a concert by
the New York Philharmonic and two conductors, Walter Damrosch and
Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky conducted two of his works.
   Soviet composer Alfred Schnittke will write a work for the
Cleveland Orchestra as part of the centennial, said Carnegie General
Manager Judith Arron.
   ``Since Tchaikovsky came and opened the hall, it is fitting that
one of the most celebrated of Russian composers today could write a
new piece for us,'' she said.
   Tchaikovsky memorabilia and manuscripts on loan from the Soviet
Union will be the first exhibit in a Carnegie Hall Museum adjacent
to the hall.
   Under a $500,000 Centennial Commissioning Project, 10 or more
compositions will be premiered during the centennial season, Mrs.
Arron said.
   All the pieces will be making their debuts in Carnegie except for
Sir Michael Tippett's setting of poems by William Butler Yeats for
soprano Jessye Norman and the Chicago Symphony.
   The composition is a joint commission with the Chicago orchestra,
which is celebrating its 100th anniversary the same season, Mrs.
Arron said.
   The first performance will be in Chicago. But Sir Georg Solti's
final performance with the orchestra as its music director will be
at Carnegie, she said.
   Solti, whose term as music director ends, has directed the
Chicago Symphony since 1969.

<HEAD>Composer's Countryman Premieres Long-Suppressed Satire Aimed At Stalin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich credits recent
Soviet moves toward artistic freedom for his plan to present the
world premiere of a long-suppressed musical satire written by the
late composer Dmitri Shostakovich to ridicule the Stalinist regime.
   The unpublished, 15-minute theatrical piece entitled ``Rayok,''
Russian for ``Little Eden,'' will be performed for the first time
Thursday night in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall, with Rostropovich
at the piano leading a cast of four bass singers and a small mixed
chorus.
   Three additional performances will be given at the Kennedy Center
through Tuesday, and Shostakovich's son, Maxim, a conductor who
defected to the United States in 1981, was expected to be in the
audience for a Sunday afternoon performance in New York's Carnegie
Hall.
   Rostropovich, the Soviet-born music director of the National
Symphony Orchestra, apparently acquired a copy of the score and
libretto for ``Rayok'' only recently. At a news conference Tuesday,
he refused to say how or exactly when it fell into his hands.
   ``There are a lot of counterfeits around,'' he said, ``but I'm
willing to put my life on the line that this is Shostakovich's
music.''
   He said Shostakovich secretly wrote ``Rayok'' in 1960 to express
his contempt for Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who had died seven
years earlier, and two senior Kremlin bureaucrats who had led a
harsh ideological crackdown on Soviet composers, writers and artists
in the late 1940s.
   Rostropovich, a close friend of Shostakovich for more than 20
years, said that until recently it would have meant imprisonment or
the death penalty to perform ``Rayok'' in the Soviet Union. But
under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he said, ``now you can
do this even in the Soviet Union.''
   Rostropovich said he knows of no plans for a Soviet performance
of the work, although he said the late composer's family is
negotiating to have it published.
   He said he has no fears his performances of the long-hidden piece
might jeopardize the safety of the Shostakovich family, as it might
have in the recent past. ``If I thought this would make it difficult
for the family, I wouldn't do it,'' he said.
   Rostropovich said the ability to present ``Rayok'' without fear
of repercussions is another sign that ``now the Soviet Union has
truly changed and this is a happy time.'' He said Gorbachev's
repudiation of the excesses of the Stalin era vindicates
Shostakovich's criticism.
   ``Finally the arts are being turned over to people who understand
them,'' Rostropovich said. ``No one in the Politburo is being a
musical teacher to artists.''
   The Shostakovich work is a scathing put-down of Stalin and of
Dmitri T. Shepilov and Andrei A. Zhdanov, the high-level officials
of the Soviet Communist Party who led the cultural purge that began
in 1947.
   According to Rostropovich, the musical satire is based on
speeches given at a special meeting of the party's Central Committee
in 1948, where prominent Soviet composers _ including Shostakovich
and Sergei Prokofiev _ were denounced for ``formalistic tendencies''
and directed to write music of ``realism'' for the masses.
   Shostakovich privately held the musical bureaucrats in contempt
as crude and ignorant. He publicly confessed he was guilty of their
charges and was kicked out of the Moscow Conservatory.
   Rostropovich himself fled his homeland in 1974, the year before
Shostakovich died in Moscow, and was stripped of his Soviet
citizenship in 1978, the same year he was hired by the National
Symphony.
   Although heartened by Gorbachev's reform policies, Rostropovich
said he remains an official non-person in the Soviet Union and has
no plans to return.

<HEAD>Bush Tells Panel To Turn In Recommendations Before March</HEAD>

   The commission trying to find a way to
eliminate the huge federal budget deficit has the go-ahead from
President-elect Bush to start putting its proposals in writing.
   Bush sent word to the National Economic Commission that he would
like to have the group's recommendations in hand by March 1.
   Bush's decision was being hailed by commission members as a sign
that the president-elect planned to use the 14-member panel's work
in his own budget negotiations with Congress.
   The commission, which includes such leaders as Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca and AFL-CIO Chairman Lane Kirkland, was created by
Congress with the hope that it could come up with a
deficit-reduction package acceptable to the new administration and
Congress.
   Commission co-chairman Drew Lewis said the panel would be able to
meet the deadline, and many panelists expressed pleasure that Bush
had decided not to postpone the commission's report until Sept. 1,
which he had the option of doing.
   Some had feared that Bush, who was critical of the panel during
the presidential election, might decide to delay the report in an
effort to play down any recommendations from the panel.
   Lewis said he was told of the reporting decision on Tuesday by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who will retain that position in
the Bush administration.
   Lewis said Brady told him to prepare recommendations over the
next seven weeks unless he hears otherwise from Bush once he takes
office on Jan. 20.
   The commission met Tuesday to review the outlook for the economy.
The assumptions the panel decides to use for such things as economic
growth, inflation, unemployment and interest rates will have a big
effect on how much in deficit reductions it will need to recommend
to eliminate the budget deficit in coming years.
   Bush said during the presidential campaign that the commission
was little more than a stalking horse for tax increases, which Bush
has vowed to oppose.
   Since winning election, however, Bush has insisted he is serious
about reducing the federal deficit, partly to calm fears of foreign
investors and prevent a run on the value of the dollar in foreign
currency markets.
   The advisory panel, which is headed by Lewis, a Republican, and
by Democrat Robert Strauss, has scheduled a string of hearings this
month and next to craft a plan. Originally, those hearings were to
be held in secret, but a group of news organizations won a court
battle last week that forced the sessions to be opened to the public.
   Lewis, former transportation secretary in the Reagan
administration and now chairman of Union Pacific, said Tuesday it
was possible that the commission might be forced to issue a majority
and a minority report because differences among panel members could
prove too wide to bridge.
   He said there was also a possibility that even after the
commission issues its report, it may be called back into session by
the administration if a deadlock develops with Congress over the
budget.
   ``If the president-elect and Congress can't solve this problem,
then we probably would be brought back into action,'' Lewis said.
   The meeting Tuesday was the first one attended by Bush's two
appointees to the panel, former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., and former
Rep. Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio.

<HEAD>10 Million to One Chance, But Double Failures Still Occur</HEAD>

   The chances of all of an airliner's engines
going out may be 10 million to one, but with millions of flights
each year, it still happens.
   At least four U.S.-built jetliners, in addition to the Boeing 737
that crashed Sunday in England killing 44 people, have experienced
the loss of all their engines in flight, according to government
records:
   _Last May, an El Salvadoran Taca Airlines 737 lost both engines
while descending in a thunderstorm near New Orleans but managed to
land safely on a levee.
   _In August 1987, another 737 belonging to a European regional
airline lost power in a snowstorm over Greece, but pilots restarted
the engines.
   _In May 1983, an Eastern Airlines Lockheed L-1011 en route from
Miami to the Bahamas lost all three of its engines, but pilots
managed to restart one and land safely back in Miami. Investigators
concluded that maintenance workers neglected to check that critical
oil seals were in place.
   _In April 1977, a Southern Airways DC9 lost power in its two
engines in a hailstorm and crash-landed in New Hope, Ga., killing 62
people and injuring 23 others.
   The four incidents occurred over a period when U.S. airliners
were logging between 6 million and 7 million flights a year. A
British investigator said there was a one in 10 million chance of
both of a two-engine airliner's engines failing on the same flight.
   The two incidents involving 737s powered by CFM56 engines like
those on the British flight led the Federal Aviation Administration
to issue air worthiness directives ordering pilots to take special
procedures during landings in stormy weather.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the directives would not have
applied to the British flight, however, because it was in clear
weather and at a high altitude when the first engine failed.
   Although some officials at the scene in England initially said
pilot error was not to blame, investigators said Tuesday they were
looking into the possibility that the pilot erroneously shut down
his remaining good engine instead of the one that caught fire in the
air.
   National Transportation Safety Board records show 92 double
engine failures in U.S. airplanes since 1962, but the vast majority
were in small planes that ran out of gas.
   When both engines on a plane go out, investigators normally would
look at the performance of the pilot, particularly actions taken
after one engine fails, along with the engines themselves, the fuel
and electrical systems, and the possibility of sabotage or
maintenance failure, among other possible causes.
   Planes with the CFM56 engines such as those used on the 737 have
been involved in 13 air accidents or incidents, including four that
were attributed to engine trouble, according to safety board records.
   Two days before the British Midland crash, a federal judge in
Cincinnati ordered the unsealing of a four-month-old lawsuit that
alleges that components in engines including the CFM56s used in the
new Boeing 737 that crashed in England were inadequately tested at a
General Electric plant in Seattle, Wash., and that the company
falsified test reports on military engines.
   GE has denied inadequate testing of any CFM56s, and FAA spokesman
Farrar said a timer assembly for the engines involved in the suit
could not have caused the British crash. He said its failure would
only cause a small increase in engine temperature but not fire.
   Farrar said no government investigation of engine testing is
planned before investigators determine the cause of the crash.
   ``Any engine has to meet very rigid requirements as to
performance and construction,'' said Farrar. ``There is no reason to
believe the GE engines had any fatal flaw.''
   The engines were thoroughly tested in France, at the GE plant in
the United States and again after they were installed in the plane
in Seattle, said General Electric spokesman William Shumann. He said
about 1,000 of the engines are in use.
   But James Helmer, lawyer for former GE Seattle plant manager
Anthony DiVincenzo, who filed the suit, said the timer part and
possibly other GE-built components of the CFM56 were inadequately
tested. He said DiVincenzo secretly filed his suit after he exposed
inadequate testing to GE officials and was demoted and reassigned to
a plant in Cincinnati.
   ``The government should have been investigating this engine six
months ago, not after 44 people are killed,'' Helmer said in a
telephone interview.
   Helmer said a team of whistleblower lawyers would conduct an
investigation of engine manufacturing, including visits to the GE
plant in Seattle, an examination of documents on engine tests and
depositions from plant workers and officials.
   The CFM56 engines on the British plane were manufactured in
France with both U.S. and French components under an agreement
between GE and the French company SNECMA. The CFM56s used on 737s
have been in service for about five years.

<HEAD>UPI Pegs 1988 Loss at $16 Million, Announces Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International says it lost $16
million in 1988 and it is laying off about 40 employees.
   President Paul Steinle said Tuesday that the 1988 loss was down
substantially from a $25 million shortfall in 1987, and that he
expects the 81-year-old news agency to begin turning a profit by the
end of this year.
   Steinle said about one-third of UPI's losses in 1988 resulted
from one-time costs involving the Olympics, political conventions,
elections and staff severance payments.
   The UPI president said in a statement that some 40 positions were
being eliminated worldwide. Although the statement did not give a
breakdown, UPI staffers speaking on condition of anonymity said 20
of the jobs were in foreign bureaus and 20 were in domestic bureaus
including 10 in Washington, where UPI has its world headquarters.
   Steinle said no UPI services were being eliminated, and that he
expected that about 40 persons would be hired as regional business
reporters sometime in 1989, restoring overall staffing to its
previous level.
   UPI said it was combining two managing editor positions into one,
with Bill Ferguson, former managing editor for national news,
becoming managing editor of UPI News.
   Leon Daniel, who had been managing editor for international news
since 1987, will return to reporting, UPI said.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop describes
himself as an opponent of abortion, but he's finding friends where
he previously had few in the wake of his decision not to issue a
report on health effects of abortion.
   The pro-choice National Abortion Rights Action League praised
Koop on Tuesday for having ``too much integrity to issue a biased
report.''
   The anti-abortion March for Life group, however, said the surgeon
general was ``highly misguided.''
   Neither group, though, agreed with Koop's recommendation that a
definitive study costing $10 million to $100 million be conducted to
decide conclusively whether women suffer mental or physical effects
from abortion.
   Nancy Broff of NARAL said the money could be better used for
contraception research, while Nellie Gray of March for Life said,
``We don't need any more studies; what we need is for Koop to
retire.''
   However, one anti-abortion group, National Right to Life, said a
study like the one Koop is proposing is ``long overdue.'' Olivia
Gans, a spokeswoman for the group, claimed that psychological harm
from abortion often surfaces five to 10 years later, while existing
research generally is based on studies of women in their first year
after abortion.
   Koop said he refused to issue a report requested by President
Reagan because existing data ``simply do not support the premise
that abortion does or does not cause a specific, post-abortion
psychiatric syndrome.''
   In a letter to Reagan earlier this week, Koop said that among the
president's advisers, ``it was a foregone conclusion that the
negative health effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming
that the evidence would force the reversal of Roe versus Wade,'' the
landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
   But Koop said no such scientific evidence exists. He said that
while anecdotal reports are plentiful to support both sides,
``individual cases cannot be used to reach scientifically sound
conclusions.''
   Reagan administration officials would not comment on Koop's
decision. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan
``doesn't have any characterization one way or the other'' of the
surgeon general's letter.

<HEAD>NBC Barely Edges CBS in Final Football Playoff Week</HEAD>

   Here's how NBC analyst Gerald Jaffe watches
football:
   ``I'm sitting there watching the game and when that fourth
quarter started, I'm thinking, we're looking at a 7:25 (p.m.)
finish, and there goes the week for us.''
   But the San Francisco 49ers wrapped up a 28-3 victory over the
Chicago Bears in the NFC championship. Jaffe was relieved, not
because he's a 49ers fan, but because the high-rated game ended
early enough to keep CBS from edging NBC for the victory the weekly
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   NBC won the week, its 29th in a row, by a tenth of a rating point
over CBS, 15.5 to 15.4. It was CBS' highest average rating since
March 1987. ABC had a 12.8.
   CBS also got help from Monday night football _ but on the other
two networks. ABC and NBC split the audience with competing college
bowl games.
   ``When you have two bowl games head to head, and the competition
appeals to a different audience, they're going to get a big
number,'' said Jaffe.
   Sure enough, CBS Monday shows ``Designing Women,'' ``Murphy
Brown'' and ``Almost Grown'' had their highest ratings of the season.
   CBS won the new ratings race decisively, thanks to pre-emptions
on NBC and ABC for football last Monday. The ``CBS Evening News''
had a rating of 13.5 and a 23 share. ``ABC World News Tonight'' had
a 12.3 and 21. ``NBC Nightly News'' had an 11.6 and 20.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 homes with television. The share
is a percentage of sets in use.
   CBS' new talk show starring Pat Sajak didn't go up against NBC's
late-night king Johnny Carson himself Monday night, but the premiere
of ``The Pat Sajak Show'' out-rated ``The Tonight Show'' with guest
host Jay Leno in the 17 largest television markets.
   Sajak had a rating of 7.0 and a 25 share for the hour it was
opposite ``Tonight,'' which had a 6.1 and 18 share. For the entire
90 minutes, Sajak had a 6.7 and 25. Sajak also competes against the
first half of ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' but Letterman was
a repeat Monday night. Sajak went up against a Carson rerun Tuesday,
and Carson was to return in a new show Wednesday night.
   Michael Eisenberg, CBS vice president for national research, said
Sajak increased CBS' rating in the 90-minute time period by 64
percent. CBS had previously run reruns and low-budget original
dramas in the time period.
   In prime time, ``The Cosby Show'' returned to first place last
week with a 28.6 rating and 43 share. The rest of the top 10 were:
``NFL Championship Post-Game,'' CBS; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS;
``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; ``A Different World,''
NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC;
and ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``Scarface,''
``Oh, God, You Devil,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Sugar Bowl,''
``West 57th,'' ``Tattinger's,'' ``TV 101,'' ``HeartBeat,'' ``Dirty
Dancing'' and ``Knightwatch.''

<HEAD>Japan's Car-Quota Extension Draws Little Praise</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Retransmitting to fix slugline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's decision to retain its cap on car
exports to the United States drew little praise in this country,
with reaction split between those who wanted the voluntary export
quotas lowered and those who say the restraints are no longer useful.
   Two of the Big Three U.S. automakers, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., welcomed the decision, announced Tuesday in Tokyo. While
Chrysler said the restraints were needed to keep the U.S. auto
industry healthy, Ford broadened its justification for the quotas by
saying they should remain in place until the United States has
approached trade equity with Japan in products ranging from steel
and textiles to semiconductors.
   General Motors Corp. called the quotas ``irrelevant'' in a market
where Japanese makers have consistently shipped fewer cars than the
number allowed by their government.
   ``The extension .. is almost symbolic,'' GM said. ``The (quotas)
are not constraining shipments from Japan and are not expected to
under current market conditions.''
   Japan's minister of international trade and industry, Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, said Tuesday in Tokyo that Japan would continue to limit
car exports to the United States to 2.3 million vehicles annually
and predicted shipments in fiscal year ending next March would fall
100,000 vehicles short of the quota.
   He said the decision to continue the voluntary restraints was
taken out of concern that uninhibited car exports would trigger
protectionist sentiment in the United States.
   Japan unilaterally adopted the quotas in 1981 as a way to dampen
calls for legal restrictions on imports of Asian cars.
   The action came amid a deep depression in the U.S. auto industry,
high gasoline prices that steered car buyers from Detroit's larger
products to more fuel efficient smaller cars, and a strong dollar
that gave imports a price advantage over domestic products.
   The auto industry has since recovered its strength, in part
through adopting Japanese-style production methods. And as gasoline
prices have dropped the public's taste has swung back toward larger
vehicles made by Detroit.
   Also, the dollar has been sharply devalued against the yen,
forcing Japanese automakers to raise dollar prices to cover their
production and shipping costs.
   The shifting marketplace has altered the nature of the quotas
from a policy that protects U.S. makers to one that increases their
competition, said David Healy, automotive analyst with the New York
brokerage house of Drexel, Burnham Lambert.
   ``The Japanese, being smart businessmen, have gotten around the
quotas in many ways,'' he said. ``One is to build more cars in the
United States, more domestic competition.''
   Another is to ship more expensive cars to the United States,
since the quotas are based on the number of vehicles, not their
dollar value, Healy said.
   The Japanese announcement did little to appease the chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
who said the quota ``fixes the number so high it really doesn't
matter.''
   The United Auto Workers union praised the Japanese decision while
expressing disappointment that the quotas had not been made more
stringent.
   ``As usual, the current administration was of no assistance in
persuading the Japanese to renew the (quotas),'' said UAW President

   With George Bush heading to the White House, some
residents of his adopted state are doing strange things to get
tickets to the Black Tie and Boots Ball, a Washington inaugural bash
organized by Texans.
   One Houston socialite called Rep. Charles Stenholm demanding
tickets to the ball because she had bought a $6,000 gown for the
evening and intended to come. When she was told that no tickets to
the Jan. 21 event were available, the woman burst into tears and
proclaimed flatly that she would come anyway.
   Stenholm, president of the Texas State Society, a group of Texans
who live in Washington, says such behavior is not uncommon as his
office prepares to throw a party that's become a hot inaugural event
even though it isn't on the official schedule of events surrounding
Bush's inauguration.
   One Texan who didn't get tickets called Stenholm's office in a
snit because he had heard that non-Texans were going to the ball. He
demanded that guests be required to show Texas birth certificates at
the door to be admitted, said Chino Chapa, Stenholm's press
secretary.
   That request was turned down, Chapa said, because ``our guest of
honor wouldn't have qualified.''

   Members of the Mississippi Senate need no
longer worry about having staff members deliver nasty letters to
them at the Capitol.
   Charles H. Griffin, secretary of the Senate, sent a one-page
memorandum to Senate staffers this week banning hand deliveries of
those types of correspondences.
   ``The Senate staff will deliver to senators legitimate
communications involving legislative and governmental affairs,''
Griffin's memo says.
   The memo instructs staff members not to deliver unsigned or
derogatory, defamatory or obscene materials.
   The policy was formulated after a senator complained during the
Legislature's August special session on county government reform,
the Senate secretary said.
   ``People have the right to petition, but not to the point of
writing an obscene letter,'' said Griffin.

   Owners of radio station WSEX say
they got as ``much mileage'' out of their name as possible.
   They turned to the NFL's Chicago Bears in changing the call
letters to WCBR on Monday.
   The station, northwest of Chicago, won a battle with the Federal
Communications Commission in 1983 to change from WTCO to WSEX.
   ``The WSEX name instantly put us on the map,'' station manager

   One of the country's most senior law
enforcement officials was shot to death in the driveway of his home
in an apparent execution-style slaying.
   Assistant Federal Police Commissioner Colin Winchester was shot
twice in the head at point-blank range late Tuesday.
   Immediately afterward, police blocked roads leading in and out of
the capital and searched all vehicles.
   Federal Police Commissioner Peter McAulay said drug gangs were
among possible suspects in the killing and newspapers speculated it
was related to drug investigations.
   Winchester, 55, was shot with a .22-caliber pistol while still in
his car after driving home from work, said a police spokesman, who
could not be named as is customary here.
   Justice Minister Michael Tate said the killing lowered the nation
to a new level of crime.
   ``For someone to assassinate an officer in a private home is a
new thing for Australia,'' he said during an emotionally charged
news conference.
   Winchester ranked among Australia's top 10 senior police
officials. Chief Superintendent Lloyd Worthy said the style of
killing pointed to a professional gang, but he declined to elaborate.

   Hirohito died Saturday of intestinal cancer at the age of 87. He
was succeeded as emperor by his son, Akihito.
   The Japan trip is the first foreign travel announced for Bush,
who will be inaugurated Jan. 20.
   The announcement confirmed that the incoming administration will

at the State Department earlier Tuesday as the most important U.S.
bilateral relationship in the world.
   The late Japanese monarch is now known as the Emperor Showa,
using the historical name of his reign, which covered 62 years
marking Japanese military expansion, the nation's defeat in World
War II, reconciliation, reconstruction, dramatic economic growth and

plans to campaign for changes in insurance laws in 14 states,
patterned after the successful ballot initiative in California.
   Robert M. Brandon, vice president of the federation of statewide
citizens organizations called Citizens Action, said Tuesday a

spreading as a result of the passage of Proposition 103 in
California, which ordered rollbacks in auto insurance rates.
   Brandon said the campaigns varied, but that in general they seek
tougher regulation, lower rates, full disclosure of financial
information and elimination of anti-trust exemptions for insurance
companies.
   He said campaigns were planned or underway in Connecticut,
Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New

   A new Pentagon-published book on terrorism
doesn't break new ground on the issue, but officials say it should
make Americans more aware of the threat terrorism represents to
national security interests.
   The book, ``Terrorist Group Profiles,'' describes the Abu Nidal
group in the Middle East as ``the most dangerous terrorist
organization in existence.''
   Charles S. Whitehouse, assistant defense secretary for special
operations and low-intensity conflict, said the 131-page book
published Tuesday should be helpful as a comprehensive reference
document.
   ``This is not an intelligence document, but rather a compilation
of open-source material that has been verified by classified

   ``Copies will be distributed starting today to public government
agencies, to public libraries as well as to government libraries. It
will also be distributed to law enforcement activities, diplomatic
posts and domestic and overseas Department of Defense components and

   Whitehouse said the publication had nothing to do with recent
Reagan administration claims that Libya is building a plant that
could supply chemical weapons to terrorists.
   The official said that while Libya appears to be increasing its
support of terrorism around the world, Iran must still be considered
the world's top supporter of terrorism.

<TEXT>
   The discovery of a river of gas flowing toward the
middle of the Milky Way supports the belief that an infinitely dense
speck more massive than 1 million suns lies at the heart of the
Earth's galaxy, astronomers say.
   The speck is known as a black hole, collapsed stars with such
intense gravitational pull that nothing can escape from it, not even
light. While many astronomers believe that a massive black hole
exists at the core of the Milky Way, this has still not been proven.
   In research presented Tuesday, astronomers described their
discovery of a 90-trillion-mile-long stream of gas that apparently
is being sucked across the heavens into the black hole.
   Although black holes cannot be seen, astronomers look for other
evidence of their existence, such as the tug of their gravity on
nearby celestial objects.
   Paul Ho, who directed the research at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, noted that the galaxy's center
is a gravitational well.
   ``We think that stars drift toward the center,'' he said. ``It's
a natural place for a massive black hole to form.''
   Ho's radio telescope observation was made with astronomers from
the Max Planck Institute in Munich and the University of Cologne,
both in West Germany, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The report was presented at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society here.
   ``This is a complex region,'' Bonnerd J. Teegarden of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said of the study.
``Results like these are adding a lot to our understanding.''
   Teegarden said that most astronomers believe that a massive black
hole exists at the center of the Milky Way.
   He noted that the nature of this and other black holes is one of
the most exciting areas of research and speculation in astronomy.
   ``It pushes hard on the basic concepts of physics,'' he said.
``Physicists don't really know what happens when you collapse a
million solar masses of matter down to a point. The laws of physics,
as we know them in the laboratory, are inadequate to explain such an
extreme situation.''
   Earlier, astronomers have spotted signs of a massive gaseous
cloud spinning around the Milky Way's center, which is 30,000 light
years from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. A light year is 6
trillion miles, the distance light travels in a year.
   Scientists believe the cloud is circling a black hole that is 1
million times more massive than the sun. They theorize that parts of
the cloud constantly fall into the black hole.
   Perhaps the equivalent of one-thousandth of the mass of the sun
spirals into the black hole each year. This produces tremendous
amounts of kinetic energy, the energy released by motion.
   ``These black holes could be the most powerful generators that we
know about,'' said Ho.
   Astronomers believe that black holes provide the energy of
quasars, enormously powerful radio emitters that are the most
distant objects in the universe.
   The latest discovery suggests that a stream of gas snakes across
space, providing the fuel that keeps the Milky Way's black hole
going.
   Ho believes that a recent stellar explosion, called a supernova,
knocked loose part of a large nearby island of gas. This, in turn,
was grabbed by the gravity of the black hole and pulled in a stream
into its own orbiting cloud.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Burmese Students May Have Been Forcibly Repatriated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand has forcibly repatriated
Burmese students to their homeland, subjecting them to possible
detention and harsh treatment by Burma's military government,
Amnesty International says.
   The London-based human rights organization said Tuesday that
Thailand on Jan. 6 forcibly returned 22 students who had fled
neighboring Burma after a bloody military coup Sept. 18.
   In a statement telexed to news agencies in Bangkok today, Amnesty
said it feared the 22 and other students previously repatriated by
Thailand may have been detained and abused by security personnel in
Burma.
   Thai authorities have denied forcing any students back and the
Burmese government claims they are treated well on their return.
   Amnesty International said its concern was based ``on increasing
evidence that many political prisoners arrested for having been
actively involved in the March-September uprising have been held
incommunicado without charge or trial since their arrest and that
some of them have been subjected to torture or other forms of severe
treatment.''
   Its concern was also based ``on information that Thant Zin, who
was repatriated last Dec. 26 with some 80 other students, is said to
have been arrested after arriving in his home town of Mergui in
Burma's southern Tenasserim Division. He has apparently been held
incommunicado since his arrest and his current whereabouts are
unknown.''
   The statement said the group of 22 students who were forcibly
repatriated included Sai Myon Wyn Tun and Kyai Moe, both age 23, who
had taken leading roles in the August and September demonstrations
for democracy in their hometown of Taunggyi in Shan State.
   It said the 22 were part of a group of 36 students of the Shan
ethnic minority whom Thai police rounded up two weeks ago in Mae
Hong Son province bordering Burma.
   The statement said: ``They are said to have repeatedly expressed
fears for their safety and to have petitioned the Thai authorities
not to be returned to Burma and eventually went on a hunger strike.
They are understood to have been forced to board a plane from Tak
airport on Jan. 6, 1989, by Thai army personnel. They 14 remaining
students are believed to be still held in Tak airport, pending
similar repatriation.''
   Thousands of students, who had been at the forefront of the
campaign for democracy, fled to Thai border areas controlled by
ethnic-based insurgents after military commander Gen. Saw Maung's
troops seized power and killed hundreds of unarmed demonstrators.
   Thailand initially promised the students temporary asylum.
   But that changed after Thai army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
visited Burma on Dec. 14, becoming the first foreign dignitary to
visit since the coup.
   He and Saw Maung reached an agreement to repatriate the students,
and two processing centers were established, in northern Tak
province and another north of Bangkok.
   Amnesty International said that under the present policy,
students who did not return home faced two other choices: return to
the malarial jungles to fight alongside the insurgents or be tried
as illegal immigrants in Thailand.
   The Thai Cabinet on Tuesday extended to March 31 a deadline for
the students to return home. Chavalit has proposed to the Cabinet
that those who fail to report themselves for repatriation by then be
sent back after being charged with illegal entry, the Thai newspaper
The Nation said today.
   The U.S. State Department said on Jan. 5 that it was looking into
``credible reports'' that some students had been arrested on their
return and died in custody.
   The next day, Burmese government spokesman Kyaw Sann responded:
``Rumors about arrests and deaths of students in government custody
... are absolutely unfounded and malicious.''
   Two U.S. senators, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., discussed the issue with Chavalit in a meeting Tuesday in
Bangkok.
   The Nation said today that the senators were told by the general
the students were being offered the chance to return ``to continue
their studies and to build democracy by peaceful means.''

between 126.48 yen and 126.95 yen.

   Dealers said investors were a little cautious at the start of the
trading day because of the sharp gains so far this week, but added
that the index moved up following buying orders from individual and
foreign investors.
   On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency started high in
early trading when ``yen-dollar transactions outpaced those of the
West German mark or the Swiss franc,'' said a dealer with a major
commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke anonymously.
   He added however that trading was light with only a few
participants in the absence of economic news to affect the market.

   A former Navy enlisted man tried to sell
submarine warfare secrets to the Soviets because he had been
discharged for indecent exposure, according to authorities who said
no damaging information was passed along.
   Craig D. Kunkle, 39, was arrested Tuesday at a Williamsburg motel
as he tried to turn over classified documents to two undercover FBI
agents posing as Soviet officials, said Irvin B. Wells III, head of
the FBI's Norfolk office.
   Kunkle, a former chief petty officer, was charged with attempting
to deliver classified information to a foreign government. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   Kunkle, of Virginia Beach, was discharged from the Navy in
October 1985 as non-judicial punishment for multiple acts of
indecent exposure committed at the Barber's Point Naval Air Station
in Hawaii, according to an FBI affidavit filed in U.S. District
Court.
   Beginning early last month, Kunkle talked six times with an FBI
undercover agent whom he believed to be a representative of the
Soviet embassy in Washington, the affidavit said.
   ``During each of these conversations, Kunkle discussed various
aspects of his military background and experience, and his desire to
sell classified United States Navy military secrets to the Soviet
Union for monetary gain, and as revenge for his discharge from the
United States Navy,'' the affidavit said.
   It did not specify how much money Kunkle is alleged to have
expected for the documents.
   The court papers said Kunkle was a specialist who installed
submarine monitoring equipment on Navy aircraft. He served in the
North Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific oceans and gained
security clearance in 1984, when he was designated an anti-submarine
warfare supervisor.
   He was working alone in his attempts to sell the information to
the Soviets, said Wells.
   Kunkle's wife, Suzanne A. Kunkle, is enlisted in the Navy. ``We
are interviewing her, but there's no indication of any involvement
on her behalf,'' Wells said.
   Kunkle was first identified by counterintelligence surveillance
of telephone calls to the Soviet embassy in Washington, said a
source who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. counterintelligence
agencies routinely monitor telephone calls to the embassy in an
effort to prevent spying.
   The case is unrelated to the Norfolk-area spy ring led by former
Navy sailor John Walker, who is serving a life sentence for selling
valuable Navy secrets to the Soviets, FBI spokesman Charles W.
Steinmetz said.
   The affidavit said that on Dec. 9 Kunkle mailed a packet of
documents, photographs, diagrams and related information to the
undercover FBI agent at an Alexandria post office box.
   Kunkle told the agent his intention ``was to demonstrate the type
of classified information he was capable of providing to the Soviet
Union then, and in future contacts,'' the affidavit said.
   The Navy determined on Dec. 14 that the information was
classified as secret and could harm national security if released to
the Soviet Union, the court papers said.
   ``We've prevented the Soviet Union from receiving this highly
sensitive information,'' Wells said.
   At a court appearance, Kunkle said he made about $260 a week as a
security guard at Portsmouth General Hospital and worked as a
part-time investigator for CCP Pinkerton Investigative Services.
   U.S. Magistrate Tommy E. Miller ordered Kunkle jailed pending a
preliminary hearing Thursday and granted his request for a
court-appointed attorney.
   Verlon Newman, a friend of Kunkle, said he felt angry and
betrayed by the arrest. He described Kunkle as a ``typical
all-American looking guy.''

   Japan's new emperor, Akihito, likes to eat curry,
chooses his own clothes and wants to learn as much as possible about
his countrymen, a newspaper reported today.
   Asahi Shimbun said an imperial aide, answering written questions
the nationwide newspaper submitted when Akihito was still crown
prince, said the emperor also likes to watch news programs on
television and reads newspapers before and after meals.
   In response to the question of how he would share the pains and
pleasure of the people, the aide wrote, ``He appears set to know as
much as possible about the people's livelihood and think of their
troubles and joy.''
   Akihito, 55, became emperor when his father, Emperor Hirohito,
died Saturday at age 87 of intestinal cancer.
   Akihito ``seldom issues special instructions'' for meals, has
bread for breakfast and eats traditional foods of the Imperial
Palace during Japan's New Year celebrations, the Asahi said.
   One of his favorite foods is rice and curry, it said.
   Akihito has 10 dark-colored or gray suits for various seasons,
six sets of blazers with matching trousers, and about 50 ties, some
of which he has had for about 30 years, it said.
   ``He chooses himself which suit to wear each day,'' and sometimes
wears Japanese-style clothes at night, the aide wrote.
   The only time Akihito has been seen wearing Japanese-style
clothes was at his 1959 wedding. Like his father, who was reputed to
have given up traditional Japanese robes after visiting Europe in
1921, Akihito always dresses in Western style.
   Akihito apparently is interested in Chinese history. He listed a
book about the Silk Road as one of his favorites and ``Dun Huang,''
which is set in northwestern China, as a movie that impressed him,
the Asahi said.

   The arrest of the head of Mexico's powerful
oil worker's union on arms-smuggling charges amounts to the opening
salvo in a political war mounted by newly inaugurated President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, known as La Quina, is a wealthy man
with enormous political influence who has dispensed patronage to his
faithful and commanded the loyalty of hundreds of thousands of oil
workers.
   Within hours of his arrest, thousands of workers walked off the
job and troops were guarding installations of the state-owned Pemex
oil monopoly.
   Critics term Hernandez Galicia, 66, the Jimmy Hoffa of Mexico.
Admirers see the former welder as a beloved ``padrino'' who hands
out jobs and favors, attending to the welfare of his subjects and
guaranteeing the election of state legislators, mayors and city
councilmen.
   Challenging La Quina is a bold move for Salinas, who took office
Dec. 1, and provides a quick test of his vow to modernize the
nation's political and economic system.
   La Quina is a classic product of the system that suddenly turned
on him Tuesday when soldiers shot their way into his fortress-like
home in Ciudad Madero and arrested him on gun-running charges. A
federal agent was killed in the raid.
   The bad blood between Salinas and the union goes back several
years, when Salinas was budget director under his predecessor,
Miguel de la Madrid, and pushed through economic reforms that cut
into the union's concessions.
   Like other labor bosses who felt threatened by Salinas' talk of
reform, La Quina made no secret of his unhappiness when de la Madrid
chose Salinas as his successor. The union gave Salinas only lukewarm
support during one of the most hotly contested presidential races in
Mexican history.
   A source close to the new president said Salinas and his people
suspect La Quina had covertly financed opposition candidate
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
   The rift between the Salinas camp and the union widened after the
election when the union accused a top official of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, Gov. Ramon Beteta of Mexico
state, of committing fraud in his previous post as Pemex's head.
   ``Salinas is going to have to put some union leaders in jail,''
political analyst Adolfo Aguilar predicted in an interview shortly
before Salinas took office.
   La Quina's power stems from its symbiotic relationship between
the unions and the party that has governed Mexico for 60 years. It
is a relationship in which power and profit are exchanged for votes
and peace in the workplace.
   Salinas is not the first president to threaten to clean up the
unions. De la Madrid had made ``moral renovation'' the centerpiece
of his campaign.
   ``Destroying La Quina is a necessary step in the moral
renovation,'' political analyst Lorenzo Meyer said five years ago.
   But La Quina survived, heading an empire that possessed lucrative
oil drilling contracts and construction companies to funeral
parlors, ranches and union stores.
   Although he gave up the post of union secretary general more than
20 years ago, La Quina still is de facto leader of a union often
accused of murder, extortion and fraud. That doesn't matter to his
supporters.
   ``The people here love him a lot. He is like their father,'' said
a veteran journalist in Tampico, which adjoins La Quina's home turf
in Ciudad Madero on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
   In more than 30 years of union politics, La Quina turned the oil
workers union into a political and financial powerhouse.
   The union won sweeping concessions from Pemex in exchange for
peace and political support for the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
   Among those concessions was the right to handle half the outside
drilling contracts and the right to dole out jobs with Pemex.
Hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed legally through the
union as a result, and critics say the union has also amassed a
fortune under the table.

   Here is a list of some of the more notorious prosecutions pressed
by the office of Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney for the southern
district of New York, who announced his resignation Tuesday:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PIZZA CONNECTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The ``pizza connection'' trial convicted 18 defendants of
participating in a Mafia-backed drug racket, operated through pizza
parlors, that imported an estimated $1.6 billion worth of heroin
into the United States.
   The case, which began Sept. 30, 1985, and ended 17 months later
with 18 convictions and one acquittal, was one of the longest
criminal cases in federal court history.
   The defendants were sentenced to lengthy prison terms and ordered
to pay steep fines. Eight of them were also ordered to pay $3.3
million into a fund to treat drug addicts.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>INSIDER TRADING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Giuliani's office prosecuted insider trading cases in the scandal
that continues to shake Wall Street.
   Dennis Levine, a mergers executive with Drexel Burnham Lambert,
pleaded guilty to charges of securities fraud, tax evasion, and
perjury and was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $362,000.
   Takeover stocks speculator Ivan Boesky was given a lenient
sentence of three years in prison and fined $100 million in exchange
for cooperation with investigators.
   Among those caught in the avalanche were the firms of Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co., which paid $25.29 million to settle charges, and
Drexel Burnham Lambert, which agreed to plead guilty to six felonies
and pay a record $650 million fine.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BESS MYERSON</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Former Miss America Bess Myerson, her lover Andy Capasso, and
state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel were tried and acquitted
of conspiracy, mail fraud and bribery charges stemming from an
alleged plot to fix Capasso's divorce payments.
   Myerson had been charged with giving a city job to the judge's
daughter, Sukhreet, so Gabel would reduce Capasso's support payments
to his estranged wife. Myerson also was acquitted of an obstruction
of justice charge for allegedly trying to influence the grand jury
testimony of the judge's daughter, Sukhreet.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE HELMSLEYS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Giuliani's office brought tax charges against real estate and
hotel moguls Harry and Leona Helmsley. They were indicted on state
and federal charges of evading taxes by disguising $4 million in
renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business expenses
and taking bogus tax deductions.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NEW YORK CITY CORRUPTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Giuliani personally prosecuted the case against Bronx Democratic
boss Stanley Friedman and four co-defendants for a scheme to get a
$22.7 million Parking Violations Bureau contract for hand-held
computers through a pattern of racketeering. Friedman was convicted
and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WEDTECH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi was accused of turning Wedtech
Corp., a defunct South Bronx defense contractor, into a racketeering
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to public
officials for help in winning no-bid contracts.
   Biaggi was convicted of all but one of the 16 counts against him
including racketeering, extortion and mail fraud and sentenced to
eight years in prison and fined $242,000. Biaggi resigned from
office a day after his conviction.
   Others convicted with Biaggi included his son Richard, former
Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, Wedtech founder John
Mariotta, and former Small Business Administration official Peter
Neglia.
   In December, another Bronx congressman, Rep. Robert Garcia, was
accused of using his position to demand and obtain payoffs from
Wedtech, which was headquartered in his congressional district. He
is charged with extortion, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuties.
  
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TEAMSTERS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Calling it ``a major American scandal'' of Mafia domination of
organized labor, Guiliani sought to force reforms on the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters by filing a civil
racketeering lawsuit.
   The government wants a federal judge to remove from office any
Teamsters officers found at trial to have violated federal
racketeering laws. The lawsuit also sought appointment of a union
trustee to ensure free and fair union elections.
   Named as defendants were: the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America; the
general executive board of the union, as a group; the executive
board's 18 members and one former member as individuals; 26 alleged
members or associates of the American Mafia, or La Cosa Nostra; and
the mob's ruling ``Commission'' as a group. Twenty-five of those 26
defendants already have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes
such as labor peace extortion, embezzling union funds or taking
labor payoffs.

</TEXT>
<NOTE>MARCOS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, were indicted by a federal grand jury in New York on
racketeering charges, which alleged they plundered their homeland of
hundreds of millions of dollars and defrauded U.S. banks. ``No one
is above the law,'' Giuliani said in announcing the indictments Oct.
21.
   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges, while Marcos has
remained in Hawaii, claiming he is too ill to travel to New York for
his court appearance.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a 5{-year, publicity-drenched reign as U.S.
attorney for Manhattan, Rudolph Giuliani has been compared with
Eliot Ness, Thomas Dewey, Joe DiMaggio and Savonarola.
   Enthusiastic (or overzealous), incorruptible (or sanctimonious),
dedicated (or ruthlessly ambitious), he cut a wide swath through
organized crime, political corruption and Wall Street wickedness.
   On Tuesday he announced his resignation, leaving New Yorkers to
speculate whether he will run for mayor and earn comparisons with
another diminutive Italian American who ran as a reformer _ Fiorello
LaGuardia.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, entering the last year of his third term,
praised Giuliani as a ``superb prosecutor;'' pointedly, he wished
Giuliani well in his future endeavors ``in the private sector.''
   Giuliani, 44, said Tuesday he had ``not shut the door on running
for mayor'' or any other office, though he held out the possibility
that he would go into private practice as a lawyer.
   But Giuliani is in a perfect position to run.
   In 5{ years, his office has jailed the leaders of New York's five
organized crime families; broken the ``Pizza Connection'' heroin
operation; pressed insider trading cases that brought guilty pleas
from Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and an agreement to plead guilty by
Drexel Burnham Lambert; convicted Rep. Mario Biaggi and the defense
contractor Wedtech on bribery charges.
   He personally (and successfully) prosecuted the case against
Bronx Democratic boss Stanley Friedman and four co-defendants on
charges they turned the city's Parking Violations Bureau into a cash
cow.
   His office brought tax charges against real estate moguls Harry
and Leona Helmsley. He sought to have the Teamsters declared a
corrupt enterprise and have the union taken over by the government.
   He also has had a lock on the six o'clock news, appearing almost
daily to denounce wrongdoing (he once joined Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in
dressing as street scum and buying cocaine, to show how easy it was)
or to announce indictments.
   ``You couldn't distinguish between a Giuliani news conference at
conviction and one at indictment,'' Gerald Stern, administrator of
the state Commission on Judicial Conduct, once said. ``It's terribly
unfair. It distorts the administration of justice.''
   Giuliani's retort: ``I can't imagine how I could possibly have a
low profile given the cases we've done ... substantively, they're
historic cases. ... I don't conduct myself frivolously to seek
publicity.''
   He has been the subject of magazine article after magazine
article. They generally take one of two tacks, comparing him to
Eliot Ness, the crime-fighting hero of ``The Untouchables,'' or
Savonarola, the 15th-century Italian cleric and infamous zealot.
   If nothing else, Giuliani shares Savonarola's Catholicism. Born
in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, he attended parochial schools
and then Manhattan College, where he considered joining the
priesthood.
   He decided against it (``Celibacy,'' he explained.) and decided
instead to go to law school at New York University.
   The law, he said, allowed him ``to read, think and debate about
ideas.''
   Giuliani was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Manhattan office
in the 1970s; it was he who persuaded Detective Robert Leuci to
admit to crimes committed with his partners, thus opening up the
police scandal that was dramatized in the film ``Prince of the
City.''
   Two tours at the Justice Department in Washington followed,
separated by four years in private practice. In 1983, he was
associate attorney general for criminal prosecutions _ the
third-ranking position in the department.
   Then, though it appeared to be a demotion, he took the New York
job. ``This is a job I always wanted to do,'' he said.
   In the ensuing years, he has earned some admirers.
   ``Several qualities have made Giuliani the Joe DiMaggio of
prosecutors,'' wrote Jack Newfield of the Daily News. ``He is smart,
fearless, decisive, motivated. Most of all he has been smart in an
era of slick.''
   G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame professor, recalled that Thomas
Dewey _ the New York governor and Republican presidential candidate
_ was a headline-chasing prosecutor in New York in the 1930s. ``The
difference between Dewey and Giuliani is that Dewey simply busted
the racketeers _ Giuliani's busting the rackets,'' Blakey said.
   He also has made enemies _ some of them in his own party. He
clashed with his boss, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
Giuliani fought to isolate Meese from all decision-making in the
Wedtech case while Meese was under investigation in that scandal.
   Giuliani's assistant, Edward Little, called Meese ``a sleaze'' in
court. Meese called the comment ``first-year law student stuff,''
but Giuliani said he was ``ready to defend it, anytime, anywhere,
anyplace.''
   Once a Democrat, Giuliani switched to the GOP after George
McGovern was nominated for president in 1972. He has remained
steadfast in his other major allegiance: He is a diehard fan of the
New York Yankees.
   He is married to Donna Hanover, a anchorwoman on WPIX-TV. Their
son, Andrew, is 3.
   ``If I never hold another public office in my life,'' he once
said, ``I can look back on this public office and say, `I did a
really good job. My son could be proud of me.'''

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Hit Record High Again, Dollar Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index rose today
to a record high for the third consecutive day, while the U.S.
dollar climbed sharply against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 31,143.45 after
gaining 136.94 points, or 0.44 percent.
   With gains of 468.85 on Monday and 328.12 on Tuesday, the index
now has gained 3.1 percent in the first three trading days of the
Heisei era, the name given to the reign of Emperor Akihito, who
ascended to the throne Saturday on the death of his father, Hirohito.
   Investors' buying interest remained strong even after the sharp
gains of the last two days, dealers said.
   Active buying by some foreign securities firms to settle accounts
also helped push up prices, said a dealer with a major securities
firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Trading was active, with volume on the first section estimated at
1.4 billion shares.
   The dollar closed at 126.95 yen, up 1.25 yen from Tuesday's
125.70 yen finish. After jumping to a 126.68-yen opening, the
currency ranged between 126.48 and 126.95 yen.
   Speculative dollar buying on overseas markets overnight led to
the currency's sharply higher opening in Tokyo, said a dealer with
the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the dollar's recent strength against major European
currencies was the main factor behind dollar buying in Tokyo.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy of keeping
interest rates high, and the steady growth of the U.S. economy, also
strengthened the dollar, he said.
   ``Market players' vague expectations for a U.S. deficit cut
resulting from arms reductions also were encouraging them to buy the
dollar,'' he said.
   The dollar's rising trend is likely to continue for a while
``unless President-elect George Bush does something very
disappointing to us,'' the dealer added.

<HEAD>Legislature Passes Law to Prohibit Teen-agers From Smoking, Drinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature has passed a law that will
prohibit teen-agers from drinking alcoholic beverages and smoking
and revoke the licenses of stores selling the items to minors,
officials said today.
   Tuesday's move by the Yuan comes at a time of public concern that
promotions by U.S. tobacco companies are encouraging Taiwan's youth
to smoke.
   A statement issued by the Yuan said the law would ban sales of
cigarettes and liquor to youths aged 18 and under to protect their
``mental and physical health.''
   Under the measure, parents of teen-agers found smoking or
drinking could be fined up to 6,000 Taiwan dollars ($215) and stores
selling the goods to youths would have their licenses revoked, the
statement said.
   Officials said the bill will become law later this month after
President Lee Teng-hui grants his approval, a formality. Taiwan does
not currently prohibit drinking or smoking by minors.
   Health officials have accused U.S. companies of promoting
cigarettes at discotheques and locations near schools.
   And on Tuesday, the government-run Taiwan Tobacco and Wine
Monopoly Bureau accused U.S.-based Brown and Williamson Corp. of
violating a 1986 Taiwan-U.S. agreement by offering automobiles and
foreign travel as prizes in a promotional campaign for Kent brand
cigarettes.
   Under the agreement, Taiwan agreed to open its market wide to
foreign cigarettes, but restricted promotions.
   Cheng Shih-ching, director of the monopoly bureau, said
authorities were considering banning the sale of Kents, a popular
brand in Taiwan, for up to six months.
   An official of Yee Hotung Co., the Taipei sales agent of Brown
and Williamson, said the promotion ended in December.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied that
the campaign had violated the agreement, but refused to elaborate.
   Last year, this nation of 19.5 million people imported 220
million packs of U.S. cigarettes, which captured about 30 percent of
the local market, according to the monopoly bureau.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who made a name
for himself prosecuting the biggest insider traders and mobsters,
says he has not decided whether he'll enter the political arena when
he leaves his job this month.
   The high-profile prosecutor who also targeted corrupt politicians
said one of the proudest achievements of his 5{-year tenure had been
an improvement in the ``ethical climate in business and politics.
   ``When I spoke of crime five or six years ago, most people
thought of street crime and violent crime,'' he said. ``We have now
broadened those areas to business and politics.''
   Giuliani announced his resignation as U.S. Attorney for Manhattan
at a packed news conference Tuesday. He said he will leave the post
by the end of January.
   By overseeing the conviction of the heads of five New York crime
families, the insider trading plea of financier Ivan Boesky and
proposed securities fraud plea of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and
the Wedtech conviction of former Rep. Mario Biaggi, Giuliani became
the town's most talked-about prosecutor since Thomas Dewey rose to
prominence by busting racketeers in the 1930s.
   It has been widely speculated that Giuliani, a Republican,
intends to run for mayor of New York later this year, and he said he
had not ``shut the door'' on such a bid.
   ``We'll figure that out in the next few weeks,'' he said, adding
that he also could return to private practice with his top
assistant, Dennison Young Jr., who also resigned.
   Edward Lurie, executive director of the state Republican
Committee, said Giuliani and state GOP Chairman Anthony Colavita
would be meeting soon to ``discuss Giuliani's interests.''
   Democratic Mayor Edward I. Koch, who is expected to run for a
fourth term, praised Giuliani as a ``superb prosecutor,'' wished him
well in his future endeavors ``in the private sector,'' and
acknowledged that Giuliani would be a ``formidable candidate''
should he decide to run for mayor.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also praised Giuliani.
   ``He can be extremely proud of the record of his 5{ years as the
chief federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York,
particularly in the areas of organized crime and official
corruption,'' Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh also announced the appointment of Benito Romano, who
has been an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, as Guiliani's
interim replacement.
   Giuliani said his resignation should not come as a surprise
because he had said last February that he did not plan staying in
the job under the next presidential administration.
   Giuliani, who served as associate attorney general in the Justice
Department before becoming U.S. attorney here in 1983, used the
federal racketeering statutes to convict the heads of New York's
five crime families. His office also broke open a huge heroin
distribution operation in the ``Pizza Connection'' case.
   He also pressed insider trading cases. His first target, Dennis
Levine, former managing director at the investment banking firm of
Drexel Burnham Lambert, pleaded guilty to securities fraud and other
charges. That led to a guilty plea by Boesky and last month's
agreement by Drexel to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay a
record $650 million in fines and restitution.
   In addition, Giuliani's office conducted extensive investigations
of corruption among New York City officials. He personally
prosecuted Stanley Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader who was
convicted of corruption charges.
   Prosecution of the Wedtech scandal involving payoffs by the
defense contractor to public officials to obtain federal contracts
resulted in the conviction of Biaggi, D-N.Y., among others.
   Giuliani's office also indicted former Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, on racketeering charges for
allegedly plundering their homeland of hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   Most recently, the U.S. attorney's office lost a highly
publicized case _ the trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson, her
lover Carl Capasso and former Judge Hortense Gabel on charges they
conspired to reduce the alimony Capasso owed to his former wife.
   Romano, 39, for the past 18 months has been a partner in the law
firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp; Wood, where he has been
involved in civil litigation and white-collar criminal defense work.
   Appointed to the U.S. attorney's office in 1980, he rose to
associate U.S. attorney, the office's third-ranking post, before
leaving in 1987.
   Romano said he was not seeking to keep the U.S. attorney position
permanently.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of the only movie theater
here has decided to show ``Mississippi Burning,'' saying the film
about three civil rights workers' slayings would bring negative
publicity no matter what he did.
   ``Well, we didn't want to get any bad publicity for the town and
that's the only reason I didn't want to run it here,'' Shelly
Steiger said in announcing his change of mind. ``But it looks like
we're going to get it anyway.''
   Residents may have to wait some time to see the picture here,
though. Steiger said he contacted Orion Pictures in Atlanta on
Tuesday but wasn't told when the film would be available.
   ``They only have so many prints and I have to wait until the big
cities get through with them,'' the 64-year-old Steiger said. ``I'm
playing pictures now that played in Meridian back in November and
December.'' Meridian is a city of 45,000 residents about 40 miles
southeast of here.
   The movie has been released in five test markets and opens
nationally Friday.
   Steiger's mother, Lulu Ellis, who owns the 500-seat Ellis
Theater, said earlier this week that she and her son had decided not
to show the movie. She said church groups were threatening to
boycott the theater if it showed the movie.
   During most movies at the theater, blacks customarily sit in the
balcony while whites, a few blacks and Choctaw Indians sit down in
the orchestra seats. Steiger said this was by custom and was not
required by the theater management. The film is an account of the
deaths of James Earl Chaney, 21, who was black, and whites Andrew
Goodman, 20, and Michael Schwerner, 24. The three disappeared June
21, 1964, after they were released from jail in Philadelphia. They
had been stopped on speeding charges after investigating the burning
of a church by the Ku Klux Klan.
   The three were found 44 days later, shot to death and buried in a
soggy earthen dam near here.
   The movie stars Gene Hackman as an FBI agent investigating the
case and was directed by Alan Parker.
   Steiger said he wasn't sure how the picture will be received at
the theater.
   ``I don't know. Of course we're just a small town so we don't
have that kind of draw,'' Steiger said. ``I'm not just showing it
for the money. If people want to see it that's their prerogative.
And if they want to see it bad enough they can go to Meridian
because I know it will open there before here.''

   The fierce battle between rival Shiite
Moslem factions for dominance of Lebanon's largest sect has split
families and jeopardizes the strategic alliance between their
masters, Iran and Syria.
   Amid the carnage of Lebanon's 13-year civil war between
Christians and Moslems and the country's myriad other mini-wars
between feuding militias, the Shiite conflict has fractured
Lebanon's largest sect.
   Shiite sources said the battle has pitted brother against
brother, father against son as they side either with the
fundamentalist Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, or the
secular, pro-Syrian Amal militia led by Lebanon's Justice Minister,
Nabih Berri.
   More than 500 people, many of them civilians, have been killed
and about 1,500 wounded since the inter-Shiite rivalry broke into
open warfare in April.
   In Beirut's southern slums, a Shiite bastion devastated by the
fighting, huge posters of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Imam Mousa
Sadr, Amal's charismatic founder who mysteriously disappeared in
Libya in 1978, hang side by side, indicating a false unity among the
1 million Shiites.
   The two sides have vied for years for control of the country's
Shiite community, now one of Lebanon's most powerful sects.
   Hezbollah, at the cutting edge of Khomeini's Islamic revolution
abroad, seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon.
   It has built an impressive Tehran-funded social, educational and
welfare network that has in the past few years been pumping an
estimated $5 million a month into Hezbollah's coffers. This has
wooed many Shiites from Amal.
   The more nationalist Amal, armed by Syria, wants to reunite
divided Lebanon under a multi-sect government in which the Moslem
majority will share power equally with the traditionally dominant
Christians.
   ``Any Moslem who willingly abides by the rules of a non-Moslem
state is a traitor,'' says a Hezbollah slogan daubed on walls in the
squalid slums of south Beirut.
   ``Traitors are those who kidnap foreigners and carry out acts of
terrorism all over the world to serve Iran's interests at the
expense of Lebanon's Shiites,'' said Amal's security chief in the
southern port of Tyre, who identified himself only as Hamza.
   Hezbollah is considered the parent organization for Shiite
fundamentalist factions who hold most of the 15 Western hostages
kidnapped in Lebanon.
   Lebanese and Western intelligence agencies also blame Hezbollah
zealots for the 1983 suicide bombings of U.S. and French targets in
Lebanon, in which hundreds of people were killed, as well as other
terrorist attacks in the Middle East and Western Europe.
   ``All Lebanon's Shiites are branded terrorists because of such
acts,'' Hamza said. ``Many Lebanese Shiites have been deported from
foreig countries because of this.''
   Amal drove Hezbollah out of the Tyre region and most of south
Lebanon in April in a crackdown that followed the Feb. 17 kidnapping
of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   The following month, the fundamentalists, trained by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon,
seized large chunks of Amal territory in Beirut's southern slums.
   They have repeatedly clashed since, despite efforts by Syria and
Iran to cool tempers.
   Several Amal leaders have been assassinated. Among them was
Amal's south Lebanon commander, Daoud Daoud, and two senior
lieutenants. Their car was riddled by unidentified gunmen as they
drove through south Beirut in October. Amal blamed Hezbollah.
   The fundamentalists accuse Amal of preventing them from carrying
out the ``holy duty of Jihad (holy war) to liberate Palestine from
Zionist occupation.''
   To ``liberate the holy city of Jerusalem and the rest of
Palestine is the duty of every Moslem,'' Hezbollah's weekly magazine
Al-Aahd said in a recent editorial.
   Amal believes that the ``liberation of Palestine is a collective
duty of all Arabs and Moslems,'' said Abu Hassan Qobeissi, Amal's
security commander in south Lebanon.
   Speaking from his headquarters in the hilltop village of Zifta,
25 miles northeast of Tyre, he said, ``Hezbollah will not be allowed
back into the south to fire a missile into northern Israel ... and
provoke the Israelis into demolishing our villages and towns with
their planes.''
   Amal's main military objective is limited to driving the Israelis
out of their self-proclaimed ``security zone,'' a strip of Lebanese
border territory running from the Mediterranean coast to Mount
Hermon they have occupied since 1985.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Hyundai Workers Protest Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers demonstrated today
at South Korea's largest shipyard, which a strike has closed, to
protest management's involvement in an assault on leaders of their
labor union.
   Police said 10 workers were arrested for their alleged roles in
the attack Sunday near the Ulsan shipyard in which about a dozen
union organizers were hospitalized with broken arms and legs and
cuts.
   About 3,000 workers employed at Hyundai Heavy Industries, South
Korea's largest shipyard, demonstrated today at the shipyard and
outside a nearby police station where the arrested workers were
being questioned.
   On Sunday, about 100 workers carrying sticks and steel pipes had
attacked hardline union leaders who were meeting to work out a
stragegy for ending a labor dispute at the shipyard.
   A police investigation revealed that an executive of the Hyundai
group's planning department in Seoul ordered the attack, but he has
not yet been arrested, authorities said.
   The shipyard, with a workforce of 18,000, has been closed since
Dec. 23, when most workers went on strike demanding higher pay and
the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders.
   It was the second time Hyundai's management was found to have
been involved in assaulting labor leaders. Last year, a Hyundai
executive was found guilty of kidnapping a leader of a union at
Hyundai Construction and Engineering Co.
   The Hyundai group, one of the largest conglomerates in South
Korea, comprises 23 subsidiaries whose products range from
automobiles and electronic goods to supertankers.

   Snow fell across the West and the Midwest today after two people
died in an Oregon storm that triggered road-closing mudslides and
floods. A rare January tornado in Utah damaged houses.
   Snow showers fell in upper Michigan, Minnesota, the Dakotas,
Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and eastern Washington state. Rain and
thunderstorms fell from Louisiana to central Mississippi
   Snow advisories were posted for Utah's mountains, North Dakota
and northwest Minnesota. Advisories for blowing and drifting snow
were issued in northwest and central Colorado and south-central
Wyoming.
   In Oregon, the bodies of two cross-country skiers were found
Tuesday at the base of Mount Bachelor, where 2 feet of snow had
fallen since late the previous day. The skiers apparently became
disoriented in a ``whiteout,'' said Deschutes County Sheriff's Sgt.
Terry Silbaugh.
   At Crater Lake National Park, 1{ feet of snow fell by Tuesday,
raising the snow level to 113 inches, downing trees and blocking
roads.
   ``Eighteen (inches of snow) at a whack, that really gets
everybody hustling,'' said Park Superintendent Robert Benton.
   The snow closed Interstate 5 for four hours near the
Oregon-California border. A mudslide blocked one rural Oregon road
and flooding closed another.
   The brief but violent tornado Tuesday in the Salt Lake City
suburb of Sandy damaged at least 10 homes and overturned a camper,
authorities said. There were no injuries.
   The twister was the first reported in Utah in January, said
William Adler of the National Weather Service.
   In California, winds gusted to more than 40 mph today in Sandberg
and to nearly 30 mph in Lancaster.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the eastern Dakotas to
Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Iowa, with snow changing to rain
showers in the rest of Iowa, Illinois, eastern Indiana, Tennessee,
the lower Mississippi Valley, much of Texas' Gulf Coast, Alabama,
northern Georgia and the Florida Panhandle; and snow showers from
Colorado to southern Utah and the central Arizona mountains.
   High temperatures were predicted in the single digits and the
teens from the upper Missouri Valley to much of the northern Plains,
northern and western Minnesota, upper Michigan, northeast New York
state and northern New England; the 20s and 30s from the rest of New
England to New Jersey, the northern Appalachians, the rest of the

<HEAD>Broadcaster Who Described Hindenburg Disaster Dead At 83</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAY FORMANEK Jr.</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tragic 1937 crash of the German
dirigible Hindenburg was a part of broadcaster Herbert Morrison's
life until the day he died, his widow and friends say.
   Millions of radio listeners hung on Morrison's frantic
description as the giant airship crashed and burned 52 years ago.
Morrison died Tuesday at a nursing home after a long illness. He was
83.
   ``He was a quiet man and very unassuming,'' said his widow, Mary
Jane Morrison. ``But he was very proud that he was able to do that
broadcast.''
   Morrison was a 31-year-old reporter for Chicago radio station WLS
on May 6, 1937, when he described the explosion of the Hindenburg as
it approached its landing in Lakehurst, N.J. Thirty-six of the 97
people aboard died.
   As the only broadcaster at the scene, Morrison became the eyes
and ears of the world. Listeners heard him choke back tears as he
gave his account of the explosion, the fire and people falling from
the sky.
   ``It's burst into flame. Yes, it's started. It's fire and it's
crashing. It's crashing terrible. Oh my,'' Morrison screamed into
his microphone as the dirigible, nearly three football fields long,
exploded while easing toward its mooring. ``Oh, the humanity! ...
All the passengers ... I don't believe it!''
   Morrison recalled the tragedy in a 1986 interview.
   ``We saw things falling out of the Hindenburg,'' he said. ``We
had only a few seconds to have it dawn on you that it was a tragedy.
Some of the things falling out were people.''
   ``He became quite a hero,'' said 90-year-old George Biggar, who
as program director helped convince WLS' general manager to send
Morrison to Lakehurst.
   ``It is one of the greatest special events of all time on radio.
It's a shame that he's gone,'' Biggar said in a telephone interview
from Fargo, N.D.
   Morrison, a native of Scottdale, Pa., was admitted to the Sundale
Nursing Home in Morgantown in September because of a long-term
illness, said Sherry Rice, an administrator at the facility.
   He began his journalism career in Fairmont after graduating from
Scottdale High School in 1923.
   Morrison served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and
later became the first news director at television station WTAE in
Pittsburgh. He retired after developing a radio and television
section for the university relations department at West Virginia
University.
   ``He talked about it once'' now and then, said Charles McGrath,
64, a cinematographer who worked with Morrison at WTAE. ``What
struck me about him and that incident is he never got over it.
   ``He was beside himself on that recording. I think it always
stayed with him. It followed him all his life.''
   Services were scheduled for Thursday in Scottdale.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Hears Arguments on Wiretapping in Puerto Rico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A case stemming from wiretap evidence obtained in a
$7 million Wells Fargo robbery investigation could have a
far-reaching impact on Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Tuesday on
the legality of federal wiretapping on the island in the civil case,
Camacho vs. the Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
   A ruling is not expected for at least a month.
   At issue is a provision in the 35-year-old Puerto Rico
Constitution that forbids any telephone wiretapping as part of
citizens' rights to privacy.
   The plaintiffs believe that because Puerto Rico does not enjoy
the status of the 50 states, its citizens should not be subject to
federal laws that violate their constitution. Puerto Ricans don't
have the right to vote in U.S. elections, don't have a voting member
of Congress and don't pay federal income tax.
   ``We have no access to the way the laws are enacted,'' said
Charles Hey-Maestre, one of the attorneys who brought the lawsuit on
behalf of the defendants in the Wells Fargo trial in Hartford, Conn.
   Hey-Maestre represents the Instituto Puertorriqueno de Derechos
Civiles, a Puerto Rican-based civil rights organization, and the
Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York-based public law
organization in Puerto Rico that first filed the suit in Puerto Rico
where. A federal judge there dismissed the lawsuit.
   Attorneys representing the telephone company said company
officials had no choice but to obey the FBI's request to place
wiretaps. They claimed Tuesday that the lawsuit asks the court to
interfere in congressional matters.
   ``It is not in the function of this court to act as a political
branch of the government,'' said Lino Saldana, an attorney for the
Puerto Rico Telephone Co. ``Congress has legislated on a matter of
national concern and made that legislation applicable to Puerto
Rico. It has given Puerto Rico a treatment it has accorded all the
states in the union.''
   ``That's the rub,'' said Judge Hugh Bownes, interrupting Saldana.
   Saldana also contended that the company cannot be sued because a
1964 federal law provides immunity for communications carriers from
liability for their assistance of federal officers in pursuit of
criminals.
   The appeals court case dates to 1984, when the telephone company
obeyed a federal court order obtained by the FBI to place wiretaps
on the phones of several alleged members of the Macheteros, an armed
underground group fighting for Puerto Rico's independence.
   Five of those subsequently arrested with the aid of the wiretaps
are on trial in Hartford on charges of conspiring to rob the
Hartford Wells Fargo armored car company of $7 million in 1983.
   The five have claimed they are ``prisoners of war'' and are being
targeted because of their advocacy of Puerto Rican independence.
   The wiretap tapes are in evidence against the defendants in
Hartford. Attorneys said that the tapes could be inadmissible if the
court rules that federal wiretapping in Puerto Rico is
unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Injunction Against Abortion Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has barred Operation Rescue, which gained
attention with its protests during the Democratic National
Convention, from obstructing anyone entering area abortion clinics.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Ward issued the permanent injunction
against the Binghamton-based group Tuesday at the request of lawyers
for women's organizations and clinics that had sued in April.
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs said his clients asked for a
permanent injunction when they learned that Operation Rescue had
planned another series of protests here for Thursday, Friday and
Saturday.
   Ward ordered that if the injunction is violated, a $25,000 fine
will be imposed against Operation Rescue on the first day and
doubled for each additional day it is violated.
   The injunction does not preclude members of Operation Rescue from
protesting on sidewalks outside abortion facilities.
   But the order bars them from trespassing on the grounds of
clinics in New York and Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties or
obstructing people from entering the buildings. It also prohibits
members from physically abusing or harassing anyone who seeks
services or works at clinics where abortions are performed.
   Michael Tierney, a lawyer for Operation Rescue, declined to
comment about the order because he had not seen it.
   David Cole, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights,
which represented the plaintiffs, said the judge had previously
issued two temporary restraining orders against members of Operation
Rescue.
   The first was in response to a week-long demonstration by the
group in May and the second was for demonstrations planned in
October, said Cole.
   Ward fined Operation Rescue $50,000 for demonstrations actually
carried out at two clinics in May. The fine has not yet been paid,
he said.
   The plaintiffs in this case include the National Organization for
Women and clinics in the area, Cole said.
   More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested in
Atlanta during last summer's Democratic convention. Since then, it
has held demonstrations in cities including New York, Indianapolis,
Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia and Boston.

   ``Ten minutes after he had hit the bank he called up and thanked
them for their service and told them that the money will be well
spent,'' detective Bjorn Bjornson said Tuesday.
   ``At first he presented the teller with a withdrawal slip for
$400, but it was illegible and he was asked to fill in the account
number clearly.
   ``Then he produced an envelope bearing a badly written note. The

   There was no sign of a weapon, but the officer quoted a teller as

Monday's heist.
   Poilce were still looking for the culprit early today.

   Traders in Rome said the market appears to have engaged itself in
an arm-wrestling match with the U.S. and West German central banks.
   Both banks have intervened in the market this week to stem the
dollar's climb, and the Bundesbank reportedly intervened again early
today.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.25 yen to a closing 126.95. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 126.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:

five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $403.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $403.30, down from $405.10 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.70 to close at a bid $404.48.

<HEAD>Former Narc Testifies That Officers Stole Drugs, Cash From Dealers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officers in a now-disbanded narcotics
unit stole tens of thousands of dollars in drugs and cash from
dealers and divided the proceeds among themselves, a former member
of the elite squad testified.
   Leo Ryan also said he falsified a police report on a 1982 search
of a suspected drug dealer's home in exchange for a $1,000 bribe
from a prominent attorney.
   ``We really didn't care if they got convicted or not,'' Ryan said
of the dealers.
   The ex-cop turned informant testified in U.S. District Court
Tuesday at the racketeering and conspiracy trial of former Lt. John
Wilson and five other members of the defunct ``5 Squad,'' which was
created in 1980 to combat drug trafficking.
   Ryan, the government's first witness in the trial that began last
week, described more than two dozen searches during which officers
stole drugs or money. The drugs were resold to other dealers and the
proceeds split, he said.
   The indictment alleges the officers stole drugs and more than
$400,000 in cash from dealers.
   Ryan, who was convicted last year of tax evasion, said he first
stole drugs in 1982 when he and several defendants found two trash
bags containing marijuana during a search of a home.
   Former officer David Grove, one of the defendants, suggested
taking some of the marijuana, Ryan said. He said he objected, but
Grove and another squad member, Charles Hund, assured him that
``they knew a guy (they could sell the drugs to), they could trust
him, and I didn't have to worry about it.'' Ryan said he later
received $1,000.
   Hund is expected to testify for the prosecution.
   Ryan testified that one of the biggest hauls occurred on June 13,
1983, when officers found nearly $250,000 in cash while searching
the home of Walter Roeder, a suspected dealer.
   Ryan said Wilson had him tell Roeder the officers would turn the
cash over to the IRS if Roeder didn't give them some of it. Roeder,
who is expected to testify for the prosecution, eventually agreed to
give the officers half of the money, Ryan said.
   ``We were all pretty happy'' and celebrated at dinner before
returning to headquarters, where Wilson divided the cash in his
office, Ryan said.
   Ryan also said he received $1,000 from Charles Peruto Jr., a
prominent criminal attorney, for falsifying a report on the 1982
search of the home of a suspected drug dealer he represented during
which drugs were found.
   Peruto later said Ryan's testimony was ``absolutely false.''
   Peruto's name is not mentioned in the indictment and prosecutors
declined to comment on Ryan's allegation.
   Wilson and the other defendants are charged with a racketeering,
conspiracy and other crimes, including bribery of public officials,
extortion, robbery, selling drugs seized from dealers, filing false
police reports and filing false income tax returns. If convicted on
all charges, they face prison terms ranging from 20 years to 80
years.
   In addition to Wilson and Grove, the other defendants are former
officers Ronald Giongo, Richard Jumper, Frances Hilt and James
Cattalo.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling upholding the right of
a lesbian to re-enlist in the Army Reserve will have a widespread
impact, her attorney says.
   U.S. District Judge Myron Gordon ruled Tuesday that a regulation
barring re-enlistment of homosexuals violated First Amendment rights
of Miriam Ben-Shalom because it ``unreasonably chills the right to
freedom of speech.''
   He said it also unfairly discriminates against people who have a
homosexual orientation, whether they engage in homosexual activity
or not.
   The decision ``will have an impact all over the country in
similar cases,'' said Patrick Berigan, who represented Ben-Shalom.
   Ben-Shalom, 40, a sergeant, was discharged from the Army Reserve
in 1976 because of her homosexuality. After a series of court
actions, she was reinstated in September 1987.
   But the Army refused her attempt to re-enlist in August, causing
Gordon to find the Army in contempt of court in September.
   The Army then allowed her to re-enlist, pending the ruling that
Gordon made Tuesday.
   Gordon said there was no evidence indicating Ben-Shalom engaged
in homosexual acts.
   Although the Army has a ``compelling'' interest in sexual issues,
``the elimination of all soldiers with homosexual orientations from
the ranks of the Army is not rationally related to the advancement
of any compelling government interest,'' the judge said.
   Kenneth Kohl, a U.S. Justice Department attorney, said the Army
probably would appeal the ruling.
   Berigan said the ruling would allow Ben-Shalom to retain her post
with the Army's 5091st Reception Battalion.
   The decision, he said, should help homosexuals preserve their
rightful roles in the military.

<HEAD>Accused Killer Tried to Have Himself Committed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless man accused of killing, raping and
robbing a pregnant doctor at Bellevue Hospital had tried to have
himself committed to the hospital's psychiatric ward last summer but
was turned away, officials say.
   The hospital's staff advised Steven Smith to go to a clinic
because his case wasn't serious enough, said Bellevue spokesman
James Walsh.
   Smith pleaded innocent Tuesday to rape, robbery and two counts of
murder in the slaying of Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, 33, whose body was
found in her office Sunday morning.
   Smith had been secretly living in an equipment room on the 22nd
floor of the hospital since last month, police said. He had
apparently moved freely throughout the 25-story building, often
wearing stolen hospital staff clothing, investigators said.
   At Smith's arraignment, Executive Assistant District Attorney
James Kindler said Smith told police after his arrest that he had
strangled Hinnant while forcibly stealing her coat, jewelry and
other property.
   Marvyn Kornberg, Smith's lawyer, said the confession was improper
because police failed to call Smith's lawyer first.
   Kornberg said his client has a ``psychiatric background.''
   Smith was admitted briefly to Bellevue Hospital in December,
after he allegedly tried to commit suicide by taking rat poison,
Walsh said.
   ``He has a psychiatric history and a history as a felon,'' Walsh
said.
   Smith's brother, who said his name was Nick, told The New York
Times that Smith had been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in
the past.
   ``He's abnormal,'' his brother said. ``He doesn't act ordinary.''
   From April 1 to April 28, Smith was confined to a psychiatric
hospital in Columbia, S.C., for a suicide attempt, police said.
   Hinnant's family lives in Columbia, S.C., but Smith's presence
there appeared coincidental, police said.

<HEAD>Aircraft Carrier Roosevelt Steams Into Mediterranean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAETA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt
and the nine warships in its battle group sailed through the Strait
of Gilbraltar and into the Mediterranean early today, the Navy said.
   Lt. Ray Kempisty, a spokesman for the U.S. 6th Fleet, said the
two Marine amphibious groups that sailed from the United States with
the Roosevelt were still at Rota, Spain, but would soon follow the
carrier group into the Mediterranean.
   The carrier group arrived a week after two F-14s from the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy shot down two Libyan MiG 23s over
the Mediterranean. Tensions between the United States and Libya
already were high after Washington threatened to attack an alleged
chemical weapons factory near Tripoli.
   Libya contends the United States is provoking confrontation in
the area by sending the Roosevelt to the Mediterranean. It claims
the ship will be used to attack Libya.
   The arrival of the Roosevelt gives the United States two carrier
battle groups in the Mediterranean, but Kempisty said the Roosevelt
is ``basically a replacement for the Kennedy, which we expect to
return to the United States.''
   The Roosevelt is accompanied by six destroyers, two cruisers, a
frigate, an ammunition ship, an oiler and a repair ship. The Navy
said earlier that about 15,000 sailors and Marines were with the
carrier group.
   Kempisty said it was the first visit to the Mediterranean by the
Roosevelt and the Leyte Gulf, a guided-missile cruiser.
   He said the Roosevelt was carrying about 80 aircraft, including
the new F-A18s, which he said can function both as an interceptor
and a bomber. He said all aircraft carriers carry some attack planes
and that the F-A18s are normally on the Roosevelt and were not added
for this cruise.

<HEAD>Hezbollah Repulses Amal Attacks In South Lebanon</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Lebanon-Shiites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem guerrillas who
were pinned down in a mountain stronghold in south Lebanon repulsed
four attacks by Syrian-backed rivals, police reported today.
   As the fighting entered its fourth straight day today,
authorities said at least 12 fighters of the pro-Syrian Amal militia
were killed in fighting Tuesday night and eight people wounded in
earlier battled died in hospitals.
   The latest casualties raised the toll since the fighting began
Sunday to at least 107 killed and 220 wounded, police said. Amal has
admitted it has lost 38 fighters and Hezbollah 35. The other 34
fatalities were civilians.
   At least 136 people have been slain and 300 wounded since Amal
and the Tehran-supported Hezbollah, or Party of God, renewed Dec. 31
their nine-month battle for control of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites,
the country's largest sect.
   Police said about 1,000 Amal fighters used artillery, rocket
launchers and tanks on Tuesday night to shell 500 Hezbollah
guerrillas they had cornered in an enclave near Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone.
   Amal forces, backed by Syrian-supplied T-54 battle tanks, tried
four times to storm Hezbollah positions around the strategic village
of Jbaa but were driven back, police said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said: ``The Amal fighters are facing tough resistance
from the Hezbollahis who are manning firing positions in the
mountains.''
   Police said Amal fighters were regrouping today for a new
offensive against Jbaa, 10 miles southeast of Sidon and the key to
Hezbollah's defense lines.
   Amal blocked Hezbollah's supply lines to the fundamentalists'
9-square-mile bastion, which extends from Jbaa to the nearby hamlets
of Ein Bouswar and Louwaizeh, a Hezbollah base, and the wooded
slopes of Mount Safi.
   During one of their attacks Tuesday, Amal fighters broke into
Jbaa in savage fighting, but Hezbollah counter-attacked to push them
back.
   Amal on Monday recaptured four neighboring villages in the
southern Iklim el-Tiffah, or Apple Province, which had fallen to
Hezbollah the day before.
   Amal's leader in south Lebanon, Atef Aoun, said on Tuesday his
militia was determined to ``finish off Hezbollah in the south.
   ``We were stabbed in the back by Hezbollah. The price that
Hezbollah has to pay will be its existance in the south.''
   The fighting raged despite efforts by Iran's first deputy foreign
minister, Ali Mohammad Besharati, and Syrian President Hafez Assad
to end the bloodshed.
   Syria, with 40,000 troops in Lebanon, is the main power broker in
the war-battered Mediterranean country. It was Iran's main Arab ally
in the war against Iraq, but Hezbollah's challenge to its power in
Lebanon has put that strategic alliance under increasing strain.
   Besharati and Assad met in the Syrian capital of Damascus
Tuesday. Beirut's pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq daily said they agreed to
continue efforts to find a settlement.
   Hezbollah seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Lebanon. The more secular, nationalist Amal favors a multisect
government in Lebanon, with Moslems sharing power equally with the
long dominant Christians.
   Amal drove Hezbollah out of most of south Lebanon in April. A
month later, Hezbollah ousted Amal from most of south Beirut in
three weeks of fighting. About 380 people were killed and 1,150
wounded in those battles.
   Syria deployed troops in south Beirut to quell the fighting, but
fighting flared again in November with 42 people killed and 87
wounded.

<HEAD>Woman Appeals in Cyanide-Poisoning Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman convicted of killing her husband and a
woman with cyanide-laced pain relievers has asked for a new trial
because a juror's involvement in an unrelated product-tampering case
was not disclosed.
   An attorney for Stella Nickell raised the issue on Monday before
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The juror, Laurel Holliday, said that she sued a company after
biting into a cracker that contained an aspirin substitute and that
she settled the case for $500 in 1988, two months before she became
a juror in the cyanide case.
   Ms. Holliday's lawsuit was not disclosed to the court before she
was seated as a juror.
   Mrs. Nickell was convicted May 9 of causing the product-tampering
deaths in 1986 of her husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Sue Katherine
Snow, 40. They died after taking Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules
laced with cyanide.
   Ms. Snow apparently was the victim of poisoned capsules placed at
a store to make Nickell's death look random, prosecutors said.
   The deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted
a manufacturer's recall.
   Mrs. Nickell was sentenced to 90 years in prison.
   Public defender Thomas Hillier asked for a new trial for Mrs.
Nickell last spring, but U.S. District Judge William Dwyer denied
the request.
   The judge said the juror, during jury selection, interpreted
questions narrowly and literally but did not answer untruthfully.

<HEAD>Officials Say Investigation Launched Into Frankfurt-based Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German investigators have launched
a criminal probe into a Frankfurt-based company amid allegations it
helped Libya build a chemical weapons plant, officials said today.
   ``We are currently collecting and reviewing evidence regarding
the operations of I.B.I. (Engineering company),'' said an official
with the criminal investigation division of the West German Customs
Service in Cologne.
   But he also told The Associated Press, ``There is nothing yet to
indicate criminal wrongdoing. The evidence is still being examined
and we are far away from taking anything to the prosecutor.'' He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   American authorities say they have evidence that companies in
West Germany and other countries helped build a plant in Rabta,
Libya, that is capable of making chemical weapons. Libya says the
plant was built to make medicines.
   But West German officials say they have no proof West Germany
companies were involved and have cleared two other companies _
Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr and the Hamburg-based Pen Tsao medical
material company _ of any wrongdoing.
   West German and British news media have reported that I.B.I.'s
owner, Ihsan Barbouti, was responsible for civil engineering at the
Libyan plant.
   British news reports say that Barbouti currently lives in London
and that he owns a string of companies in foreign countries.
   U.S. accusations that West German firms helped build the Libyan
plant sped up Bonn's plans to improve export controls, a government
official said today.
   At a November meeting in Washington, President Reagan told
Chancellor Helmut Kohl that American officials believe firms from
West Germany and other countries helped build the Libyan plant.
   The federal government in Bonn on Tuesday announced a new package
of measures aimed at cracking down on violators of West Germany's
export laws.
   An Economics Ministry official today said West Germany has been
looking into improving its export controls ``for years'' but that
the November meeting in Washington served to quicken these efforts.
   ``It certainly resulted in a speeding up of this process to
improve export controls,'' said the official who demanded anonymity.
   However, the official told The Associated Press that there had
been ``long discussions before this meeting'' on improving export
control measures.

<TEXT>
   Madonna is withdrawing an assault complaint
against her estranged husband, Sean Penn.
   ``Madonna asked that there be no criminal charges pressed. There
is no other evidence with which to base a criminal charge so there
won't be a criminal charge filed,'' district attorney's spokesman Al
Albergate said Tuesday.
   Madonna filed the assault report at the Sheriff's Department over
an incident alleged to have occurred at the couple's Malibu home
during the New Year's weekend. Contents of the report were not
disclosed.
   However, the British tabloid press reported that Madonna was
beaten, gagged and left strapped to an armchair for nine hours
before she escaped.
   Nationally syndicated columnist Liz Smith also reported the
alleged incident, saying Madonna was ``trussed up like a turkey.''
   Those reports could not be verified.
   Neither Albergate nor sheriff's detectives would comment. Deputy
District Attorney Lauren Weiss, who met with the singer-actress on
Monday, did not return telephone calls, nor did attorney and an
publicist for Penn.
   Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said the sultry songstress
had no comment.
   Madonna moved out of the couple's Malibu home following the
alleged attack and filed for divorce to end her turbulent three-year
marriage.
   The divorce petition followed an earlier divorce filing and
fights between photographers and the hot-tempered Penn, one of which
led to a 60-day jail term for the actor.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders in the
republic of Montenegro offered to resign today in the face of
protests by tens of thousands of people demanding new leadership and
economic reform, media reports said.
   About 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets again today in
Titograd, the regional capital, Belgrade radio said. Police ringed
the republic's Parliament building to block the jostling, chanting
crowd, the radio said.
   Many of the 60,000 people who massed outside Parliament on
Tuesday chanted slogans such as ``Down With Armchair Leaders,''
``Down with Scoundrels,'' and ``We Want Free Elections.'' The
demonstrators demanded their leaders step down because of their
failure to reverse the republic's economic woes.
   In the republic of Slovenia today, a group of citizens announced
the establishment of the Slovenian Democratic Union, the first
independent political group to be set up in Yugoslavia. The Union
will strive for parliamentary democracy, free elections and the
``open competition of ideas,'' said Dimitrij Rupel, a prominent
author and the group's founder.
   The latest demonstrations in Montenegro follow the resignation of
the republic's government _ but not party leaders _ in October
during similar protests. Police broke up those protests, and party
leaders refused to resign.
   The political turmoil in Montenegro also follows nationwide
protests during much of last year that toppled some regional and
national leaders.
   The government of Premier Branko Mukulic resigned Dec. 20 over
250 percent annual inflation and other economic problems. It was the
first time the government of Yugoslavia had stepped down since the
communists took power here after World War II.
   The state news agency Tanjug said Montenegro's Communist Party
Central Committee, its policy-making body, would meet tonight to
consider the offer of resignation from party leaders and the
collectively-held state presidency. The republic's Parliament will
convene Saturday to consider the state presidency's resignation from
the largely ceremonial post, Tanjug said.
   Montenegro is one of the poorest of Yugoslavia's six republics,
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent. The republic has been hit
hard by a recent spate of closures of unprofitable firms that put
10,000 people out of work.
   The new Slovenian Democratic Union was to hold its constituent
assembly in Ljubljana later today, and Jan. 11, 1989, will be
considered as the date of its formal constitution, activists said.
   The Slovenian Democratic Union will nominate its members for
Parliament and other leading functions in the republic.
   ``The Union's first task will be the writing of Slovenia's new
constitution,'' which will be much more democratic and would, unlike
the current one, envisage multi-party democracy, Rupel said.
   The Slovenian Democratic Union is only the first of several
political associations that have announced their plans to be
formally constituted in the liberal republic of Slovenia, the region
widely considered as the most democratic in communist-ruled Eastern
Europe.
   The emergence of independent parties comes at a time when
Yugoslavia is in the throes of its deepest political and economic
crisis in history, which includes Europe's highest inflation of
about 250 percent a year, large-scale unemployment and increasing
labor and social unrest.

<HEAD>Two Victims Of Pan Am Bombing Returned To Right Families</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mixup in which the caskets of two
victims of last month's Pan Am jetliner bombing were shipped to the
wrong cities was straightened out and the remains returned to the
right families.
   The casket containing the body of 20-year-old Karen Hunt was
flown from Boston and arrived at a Rochester funeral home Tuesday,
and the body of Mary L. Johnson, 25, of Wayland, Mass., was flown
from Rochester to Boston.
   Ms. Johnson's relatives were an hour from burying the body they
thought was hers Sunday when FBI agents informed them of the mixup.
   The mistake was discovered last week when the medical examiner's
office in Rochester concluded that the body sent to the Hunt family
was not Ms. Hunt.
   Ms. Hunt's father, Robert Hunt, said the family planned a prayer
service but would not bury her until spring, when the ground thaws.
   ``We've got her body back now,'' said Hunt. ``We'll never get
over this. But at least we can start the healing process.''
   Gregory Jones, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said authorities
recovering bodies from the Dec. 21 explosion over Lockerbie,
Scotland, apparently correctly identified the bodies of the two
women but somehow flew the caskets to the wrong cities.
   ``We have no feelings at all of anger and bitterness about
this,'' Ms. Johnson's father, Robert Johnson, said earlier this
week. ``It's one of those simple mistakes that can be made. It seems
terrible at the time, but it's not a big mistake.''
   The body reported to be Ms. Hunt's arrived Thursday in Rochester.
   The family was already concerned that it was not her because
Scottish authorities' description of the clothing on the body didn't
seem to match Ms. Hunt's clothes. The medical examiner's office
confirmed their suspicions.
   Ms. Hunt was returning to New York after completing a semester in
London as part of a Syracuse University program.
   Ms. Johnson, a graduate of Brown University, was returning to
Wayland for Christmas with her family after spending 14 months
abroad, touring India and teaching English in Taiwan.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 6th graf pvs, `Halvorson was ...' to ADD
that suspect was caught in woman's home.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was allowed to decide her rapist's
fate chose a plea-bargained 4{-year sentence that will put him
behind bars immediately, then said of being asked to choose:
``Wasn't that something?''
   ``He was so kind,'' the 65-year-old victim said of Hennepin
County Judge William Posten. ``He said, `It's your decision.' I
liked that.''
   Posten called the victim into his chambers Monday and gave her
two choices in the prosecution of James Halvorson, 25. She could
have the case go to trial and hope for a conviction, which could
have meant a nine-year prison term, or she could accept a plea
agreement providing for a 4{-year sentence.
   The woman chose immediate incarceration in lieu of a trial
because Halvorson was free on bond and she feared being attacked
again, said Assistant County Attorney Kevin Johnson.
   ``She knew he would be going straight to prison'' and wouldn't be
eligible for parole for three years, Johnson said Tuesday.
   Halvorson was accused of breaking into the woman's house through
a kitchen window in the early morning hours of June 16, according to
a criminal complaint. The noise awoke the woman and she went to
investigate. A man dragged her from the kitchen to the bedroom,
covered her head with a blanket and raped her. He fell asleep after
the attack and the woman ran to a neighbor's house to telephone
police, Johnson said.
   Because Halvorson was caught in the woman's home, authorities
said his conviction was almost certain.
   Halvorson's attorney, Earl Gray, said Halvorson was ``drunk out
of his mind'' at the time.
   Halvorson had recently been convicted of drunken driving for a
fourth time and had received a delayed jail sentence two days before
the rape, authorities said.
   The woman was haunted by the thought of a second attack and had
moved in with family members, her home of 30 years put on sale, said
Cindy Clarkson, a sexual assault counselor who worked with the
victim.
   ``She was feeling pretty powerless,'' Clarkson said. ``What the
judge did was wonderful. Just wonderful. She just couldn't believe
that someone in the system like a judge would take the time to
listen to her and actually give her a choice.''
   Posten said he allowed the woman to choose the sentence because
of her age, the viciousness of the assault and the court delays.
   ``I'm not advocating that the victims decide the penalty but I
thought it was the fairest thing to do in this case,'' the judge
told the woman. ``You tell me what you want me to do and I'll do
it.''
   After announcing her decision, she said, ``Wasn't that
something?''
   ``I knew it could be months before there'd be a trial,'' she told
the (Minneapolis) Star Tribune. ``The only thing I wanted to know is
if he would be in jail during that time.''
   Posten said he has allowed victims to help decide criminals'
sentences in only a few cases.
   ``Somebody that is raped early in the morning and it's a little
lady that's a great-grandmother _ all this had an effect,'' Posten
said. ``It was the way the whole thing developed. The delays were
part of it too.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Says Short-Range Nuclear Weapons to be Modernized</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with other officials saying Lance missiles
to be replaced. No pickup.</UNK>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz says
short-range U.S. nuclear missiles in West Germany must be modernized
despite improving East-West relations, a magazine reported today.
   Another government official, speaking to The Associated Press on
the condition of anonymity, said he knew Scholz gave the interview
to the Munich-base Bunte magazine but could not confirm it contents.
But the official said modernization means ``total replacement'' of
the Lance nuclear missiles.
   The official added that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
has made no final decision for the weapons system. In late 1987,
U.S. and Soviet officials agreed to scrap all their
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   In the magazine interview, Scholz was quoted as saying that a
total elimination of short-range missiles was out of the question.
   He was quoted as saying he would rather have peace without any
weapons, ``But I am a realist. We need a minimum of nuclear
deterrance to be secure against a surprise conventional attack with
tanks and aircraft.''
   His comments come as the Bonn government struggles to satisfy a
population that has increasingly warmed to Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's ideas on arms control.
   The United States has been urging West Germany to agree to the
modernization of the aging Lance nuclear missiles but has met with
public resistance and a reluctance of officials in the Bonn
government to take a firm stand on the issue.
   Scholz was quoted as making his comments when he asked if
modernization of the U.S.-built Lance weapons would be a campaign
issue in federal elections next year.
   ``You are talking about short-range nuclear weapons. There is no
way to indefinitely get around modernization of these weapons,'' he
was quoted by Bunte as saying.
   ``A third zero-option in addition to that of the medium- and
longer-range missiles can't be considered,'' Scholz was quoted as
saying of the Lance missiles.
   The ``zero option'' calls for the elimination of a category of
nuclear missiles on both sides, such as that provided for under the
U.S.-Soviet intermediate-range missile treaty treaty signed in
December 1987.
   There are 88 Lance missiles in West Germany, faced off against
1,365 modern Soviet-built, short-range missile systems.
   The Lance missiles have a range of 75 miles, compared to the
Soviet missiles with a range of 180 miles. Modernization of the
Lance rockets would entail making them faster or even lengthening
their range.
   A replacement system would probably have a range of 240 miles,
still considered short-range, the West German government official
told the AP.
   ``But there would also probably be a lesser number of missiles in
the new system, say 50 or so, if the Soviets also agree to cut
theirs to the same number,'' the official said.
   Western officials say that even with Gorbachev's promise in
December to slash Soviet conventional forces by 500,000 troops and
50,000 tanks, the Warsaw Pact will still outnumber North Atlantic
Treaty forces by two to one.
   A copy of the Bunte interview, which will appear in the
magazine's Thursday edition, was provided early to other news media.

<HEAD>Teacher Suspected Of Bookmaking At School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school English teacher has been
arrested on suspicion of taking sports bets of up to $20 apiece from
teachers and students, police said.
   Vice officers arrested Charles Hammond, 54, at John H. Francis
Polytechnic High School in the suburban San Fernando Valley on
Friday for investigation of bookmaking, Capt. Rick Dinse said
Tuesday. Hammond was freed on $500 bail.
   Police said Hammond took bets on professional sporting events.
The wagers were placed on school grounds during lunch breaks and
after school, police said.
   Bookmaking records were seized on campus and in his home, where
officers also found cocaine paraphernalia and a small amount of
marijuana, Dinse said.
   ``The records we got from him are quite extensive,'' said Lt.
Brad Merritt. ``But so far we have no indications there was anybody
else involved.''
   ``He was accepting wagers and making money off of them,'' Merritt
said. ``He was involved in all sports, so whatever sport was in
season he would accept wagers.''
   School officials said Hammond has been transferred to a
non-teaching position.
   Teachers found guilty of gambling on school grounds, or gambling
with students, are subject to discipline ranging from a letter of
reprimand to dismissal, said Ada Treiger, an attorney for the school
district.
   Hammond's attorney, Donald Wager, said the teacher had only made
a few bets with friends and never with students. ``He has not
engaged in any betting activity that is not common with the vice
officers ... or other officers or kids,'' Wager said.
   Police said they had not determined exactly how much money was
involved.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Soviets May Have Snatched Missile Recorder</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs from Soviet spokesman after 5th graf, ``It is''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force can't find the flight data
recorder from a nuclear test missile and the Pentagon says the
Soviets may have snatched the device from where it splashed down in
the western Pacific Ocean.
   The recorder was aboard a Minuteman 2 missile test-fired from
California at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands on July 7,
1987, according to Army Maj. Bill O'Connell, a spokesman for the
Defense Department.
   The story was first reported Tuesday by the CBS Evening News and
later confirmed by the Pentagon.
   The flight data recorder was part of the dummy warhead on the
missile, which did not carry any nuclear weapons on its launch from
California. The Air Force periodically tests missiles by launching
them from California at Kwajalein, 5,000 miles away.
   ``It is unlikely that the Soviets recovered it (the recorder) in
the hours between splashdown and the first search, but that
possibility cannot be ruled out,'' said O'Connell.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
at a news briefing in Moscow that he had heard news reports of the
incident, ``and I checked with our central information agency.''
   ``They said they couldn't find anything in the lost and found,''
he quipped.
   The Minuteman is one of the main components of America's
land-based nuclear missile force.
   O'Connell said the recorder has failed to turn up in five
searches of the area where the missile splashed down.
   The recorder would contain valuable information about the
performance of the Minuteman 2 missile. It was not classified,
O'Connell noted, but its recovery ``would be useful to our missile
testing efforts.''
   ``There are many possibilities that might account for the loss,
including accidents during the handling of the recovered debris,
poor record keeping, and problems in shipping,'' he said. ``None of
these possibilities has been ruled out and the investigation is
continuing.''
   But he did confirm that Soviet personnel may have landed on
Kwajalein, which is supposed to be uninhabited.
   U.S. officials found ``vodka bottles, cigarettes, bug spray and a
few technical items of Soviet manufacture that could not have
floated ashore and would have been unlikely to have been left ashore
purposefully,'' he said.
   CBS said a Soviet trawler was about 50 miles away during the
splashdown, and a Soviet mini-submarine may have been used to snatch
the warhead's flight recorder.
   O'Connell refused to say if a Soviet sub had been detected in the
area. ``There have been a number of reports of Soviet submarine
sightings and these reports are not being ignored,'' he said. ``I
cannot, however, confirm that there was Soviet submarine activity in
or near Kwajalein.''
   The test shot came nine months after the Soviets ended a fishing
agreement with Kiribiati, the island nation next to the Marshalls,
O'Connell noted. If the fishing agreement had still been in effect,
the Soviets would have had support capabilities to try to take the
payload by sub, he said. But in July 1987, the Soviet fishing fleet
only had access to Vanuatu, over 2,000 miles from Kwajalein.
   O'Connell said the Pentagon objects strongly to any clandestine
Soviet landings in the Marshall Islands that may have occurred. He
called such incursions ``illegal and a clear infringement of the
sovereignty of the Marshall Islands, in addition to being a
challenge to the security of the U.S. testing programs.''

<HEAD>Great Blue Heron Turns Goldfish Pond into Snack Bar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big Bird, a great blue heron, has turned Vivianna
Biesen's goldfish pond into a snack bar.
   Over the past two weeks, the usually shy creature has shamelessly
reduced the population in the 25-foot pond, where she and her
husband have raised goldfish for 20 years, from 100 fish to 60, she
said.
   ``What does Big Bird think that pond is, Midget Sound?'' she
said. The bird ``comes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and in-between
snacks.''
   ``If the fish he plucks from the pond are too big, he flips them
on gravel near the pond,'' she said. ``The others? One gulp and they
are gone.''
   She spread rakes, brooms, 2-by-4 boards and shelves across the
pond, but ``they only provided better perches for the heron to
gobble fish,'' she said.
   ``As urban problems go, this one is pretty unusual,'' said Debbie
Booker, a state Wildlife Department administrative assistant. ``We
gets calls about starlings between walls, squirrels in attics,
raccoons eating cat food in outside dishes, coyotes invading
neighborhoods, but blue heron problems are rare.''
   At the agency's suggestion, Biesen spread chicken wire over the
pond, but Big Bird simply walked on the wire and continued its
forays through the mesh. Finally, last week, she lowered the water
in the pond to 2 feet from 3{ feet.
   ``The fish may have to swim sideways, but I haven't seen that Big
Bird catch any of them yet,'' she said. ``He comes back regularly
and walks the wire, but he apparently can't reach the fish.''
   Biesen said she isn't sure what she'll try next if Big Bird gets
to the fish again.
   Killing a blue heron carries up to a $500 fine and 90 days in
jail, said John Gillespie, the state agency's assistant enforcement
chief.
   Wildlife officials have suggested loud music, gunfire or a net
canopy of the sort used to halt poaching at fish hatcheries as
alternatives.

<HEAD>Steinberg Reportedly Agrees to Examination by Prosecution Psychiatrist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for alleged child killer Joel Steinberg
charged that Hedda Nussbaum is a ``malingerer'' and a ``fraud'' who
has stayed at a psychiatric facility to avoid being tried for Lisa
Steinberg's death.
   Defense lawyer Ira London said Ms. Nussbaum's stay at a
psychiatric institution is part of the ``packaging of her'' by her
lawyer, Barry Scheck.
   ``We feel she's avoided prosecution by hiding in a mental
institution,'' London said of the prosecution's chief witness.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged in the 1987 death
of his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter, who was taken from the
Greenwich Village apartment he shared with Ms. Nussbaum and died
three days later.
   Ms. Nussbaum, his long-time companion, was arrested along with
Steinberg. But charges were dropped after prosecutors concluded she
had been abused by Steinberg and was in no physical or emotional
shape to harm or help the child.
   She testified for the prosecution.
   Meanwhile, Steinberg agreed to be examined by prosecution
psychiatrists later today, sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Tuesday. But the sources said there was no guarantee
he wouldn't back out at the last minute.
   The question of Steinberg's mental state at the time of the
child's death, and whether he would present an insanity defense, has
become a key issue in the trial.
   London on Tuesday attacked Ms. Nussbaum's credibility as he told
state Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax why he should permit
testimony by a psychiatrist who interviewed Ms. Nussbaum at a
hospital shortly after the girl's death.
   ``Her condition for the past year is a fraud,'' London told
Rothwax, ``and it is part of her packaging.'' The lawyer told the
judge that whether Ms. Nussbaum is a ``malingerer'' is a credibility
issue the jury should look at.
   London said the psychiatrist would testify that Ms. Nussbaum
``has not needed that kind of treatment for the past year.''
   The judge granted London's request to allow the testimony.
   The attorney refused to say whether Steinberg would submit to the
psychiatric examination today, the deadline set by the judge. The
trial is to resume Thursday.
   Results of a prosecution psychiatric examination would be
presented to the jury only if the judge concludes that Steinberg's
attorneys are in effect presenting an insanity defense through the
testimony of their witnesses.
   Rothwax set the deadline for the examination after indicating
that he might rule later that an informal insanity defense was being
pursued.
   If Steinberg refuses to be examined by a prosecution
psychiatrist, and the judge concludes that his lawyers are indeed
presenting an insanity defense, the jurors will be told about his
refusal to be examined.

<HEAD>Two Policemen Suspended Over Death Of Black Prisoner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two policemen have been
suspended from duty following an autopsy on a black prisoner who
died last week, and investigators were considering charging them
with murder, police said today.
   Also today, police said a black robbery suspect died during an
attempted escape.
   Police said the two officers were suspended following an autopsy
on Daniel Qolobo, 33, who died Thursday in the black township of
Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg. Police said they were considering
filing a murder charge against the policemen, whose identities were
kept secret.
   Qobolo was waiting trial on charges of housebreaking when two
local detectives took him to the township to ``point out certain
spots,'' a police report said at the time.
   The report said that although Qolobo's hands were cuffed behind
his back, he tried to escape and ``whilst running away, he fell and
lost consciousness.'' The statement said Qolobo regained
consciousness but died a short while later in the police vehicle.
   Police said Aaron Dhlamini, 36, who had been detained in
connection with a charge of robbery and several charges of motor
theft, was ``fatally injured'' during a struggle with a policeman
after an alleged escape attempt.
   They said the attempt took place at the offices of a police
vehicle theft unit in Benoni, east of Johannesburg. They didn't say
when it happened.
   Police spokesman Capt. Reg Crewe said it was not known how the
man was killed, but an autopsy would be conducted.
   In the last six weeks, three black crime suspects have died in
police custody.

   A former Navy enlisted man tried to sell
submarine warfare secrets to the Soviets because he had been
discharged for indecent exposure, according to authorities who said
no damaging information was passed along.
   Craig D. Kunkle, 39, was arrested Tuesday at a Williamsburg motel
as he tried to turn over classified documents to two undercover FBI
agents posing as Soviet officials, said Irvin B. Wells III, head of
the FBI's Norfolk office.
   Kunkle, a former chief petty officer, was charged with attempting
to deliver classified information to a foreign government. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   Kunkle, of Virginia Beach, was discharged from the Navy in 1985
as non-judicial punishment for acts of indecent exposure committed
at the Barber's Point Naval Air Station in Hawaii, according to an
FBI affidavit.
   A Navy spokesman in Washington said it was against policy to
describe the circumstances of the discharge. Kunkle had an
``excellent record'' during his service, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley
said.
   Beginning early last month, Kunkle talked six times with an FBI
undercover agent whom he believed to be a representative of the
Soviet embassy in Washington, the affidavit said.
   ``During each of these conversations, Kunkle discussed various
aspects of his military background and experience, and his desire to
sell classified United States Navy military secrets to the Soviet
Union for monetary gain, and as revenge for his discharge from the
United States Navy,'' the affidavit said.
   It did not specify how much money Kunkle is alleged to have
expected for the documents.
   The court papers said Kunkle was a specialist who installed
submarine monitoring equipment on Navy aircraft. He served in the
North Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific oceans and gained
security clearance in 1984, when he was designated an anti-submarine
warfare supervisor.
   He was working alone in his attempts to sell the information to
the Soviets, said Wells.
   Kunkle's wife, Suzanne A. Kunkle, is enlisted in the Navy. ``We
are interviewing her, but there's no indication of any involvement
on her behalf,'' Wells said.
   Kunkle was first identified by counterintelligence surveillance
of telephone calls to the Soviet embassy in Washington, said a
source who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. counterintelligence
agencies routinely monitor telephone calls to the embassy in an
effort to prevent spying.
   The case is unrelated to the Norfolk-area spy ring led by former
Navy sailor John Walker, who is serving a life sentence for selling
valuable Navy secrets to the Soviets, FBI spokesman Charles W.
Steinmetz said.
   The affidavit said that on Dec. 9 Kunkle mailed a packet of
documents, photographs, diagrams and related information to the
undercover FBI agent at an Alexandria post office box.
   Kunkle told the agent his intention ``was to demonstrate the type
of classified information he was capable of providing to the Soviet
Union then, and in future contacts,'' the affidavit said.
   The Navy determined on Dec. 14 that the information was
classified as secret and could harm national security if released to
the Soviet Union, the court papers said.
   ``We've prevented the Soviet Union from receiving this highly
sensitive information,'' Wells said.
   At a court appearance, Kunkle said he made about $260 a week as a
security guard at Portsmouth General Hospital and worked as a
part-time investigator for CCP Pinkerton Investigative Services.
   Dick Rafferty, assistant administrator at Portsmouth General,
said Kunkle has worked for the hospital for three months and was
placed on unpaid leave pending the outcome of the case.
   Kunkle worked for Pinkerton for five to six months last year,
said Paul Santana, Pinkerton's southeast Virginia district manager.
He said Kunkle was a security supervisor who traveled from client to
client, making sure that Pinkerton uniformed security guards were
doing their jobs properly. He said Kunkle had a good record with the
company.
   U.S. Magistrate Tommy E. Miller ordered Kunkle jailed pending a
preliminary hearing Thursday and granted his request for a
court-appointed attorney.
   Verlon Newman, a friend of Kunkle, said he felt angry and
betrayed by the arrest. He described Kunkle as a ``typical
all-American looking guy.''

   Parliament today enacted two key laws
giving citizens the right to demonstrate and to join political
parties other than the Communist Party, the sole legal party in
Hungary since it took power in 1948.
   The new law on association, however, only grants political
parties and new independent movements the right to exist. A separate
law to be passed later this year will regulate the registration and
operation of political parties, according to officials.
   Only then will two fledgling political parties and the dozens of
independent political groups formed in recent months be able to
field candidates for parliament and for local councils.
   The long-awaited laws on assembly and assocation were passed with
an overwhelming majority in parliament a day after advocates of
greater pluralism clashed with more orthodox Communists over the
pace of reform.
   Of the 387 deputies in Communist-ruled Hungary, only six opposed
the law on association and just seven voted against the law on
assembly.
   The debate on the two laws, which pitted reformers against
Communist Party conservatives, was overshadowed by the announcement
Tuesday that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungarian
territory would begin soon.
   Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati said the withdrawal of an armored
division, an air force battalion and several air force units could
be completed soon, possibly before the end of the year.
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz was quoted by Hungarian media
as having told a Japanese newspaper that withdrawal was only a
matter of weeks away.
   Karpati's remarks came as parliament adopted by an overwhelming
majority a constitutional amendments including one that will
facilitate the introduction of an alternative civilian service for
conscientious objectors.
   Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar told the legislature the bills
adopted today laid down the ``fundamental'' rights of citizens to
assemble and to form associations, including political parties. The
house, however, did pass a measure banning demonstrations outside
Parliament.
   Janos Berecz, the Communist Party's leading ideologist, who is
also a deputy, called on independent groups that have mushroomed in
Hungary in the past year to ``help create cohesion and unity'' on
the road to socialism, saying pluralism within the current one-party
system was sufficient.

<HEAD>Eds: New top 7 grafs to recast; picks up pvs 7th graf, ``Beckwith

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to Dan Quayle asked the Republican
National Committee for ``a very large amount'' to defray the cost of
the vice president-elect's Christmas-week vacation in Vail, Colo.,
and the party approved a $25,000 payment, The Washington Post
reported today.
   RNC Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf told the newspaper that the
original request ``was not something I thought we could do.''
Quayle's spokesman, David Beckwith, said an aide had made an
unauthorized estimate of vacation expenses of $65,000.
   The Quayle family vacation plans were scaled back and Beckwith
told the Associated Press on Tuesday evening that the final cost to
the RNC would be about $15,000.
   He said that amount would cover the expenses of two aides _ their
accommodations, air fare, per diem payment, rental of a
four-wheel-drive vehicle, extra telephone lines and facsimile and
reproduction machines _ during the 10 days.
   Beckwith said an unidentified aide planning the Vail trip had
estimated the cost at $65,000, including a charter airplane, hotel
and other expenses of the Quayle family, advance men, personal aides
and others. The trip was to have included a stopover at the Jan. 2
Fiesta Bowl football game in Tempe, Ariz.
   Beckwith said Quayle considered the $65,000 proposal ``totally
out of line'' and chose to go by commercial airlines, skipping the
Fiesta Bowl, reducing the size of his entourage and paying all his
personal expenses.
   ``He never asked for a specific amount,'' the spokesman said.
``The RNC came up with $25,000.'' Fahrenkopf told the Post that
approval by the RNC budget committee came on Dec. 15 and was termed
transition support for Quayle.
   Beckwith said that Fred F. Fielding, former White House counsel
who is the transition liaison between the Quayle operation and that
of President-elect Bush, approached the RNC to aid Quayle
financially ``out of an abundance of caution.''
   ``He approached the RNC because he did not think public funds
should be used,'' he said.
   All of the Quayle family's direct expenses, including airline
tickets, hotel and food bills, were paid from their personal funds,
said Beckwith.
   Quayle was paid $89,500 as a senator and will receive $115,000 as
vice president, rising to $175,000 if the proposed pay raise for
members of Congress and senior government officials is approved. For
a three-week period, from the time he resigned his Senate seat last
week until he is sworn in as vice president on Jan. 20, he is off
the government payroll.

   A man who ``kept popping up too many times'' at
fires was charged with setting four blazes, including one that
killed four people and another for which he had someone else
indicted, police said.
   Buddy Marts, 21, was arrested Tuesday and charged with murder and
arson for the fatal fire in August. Police said he may be
responsible for at least 25 blazes.
   ``He was at a lot of them,'' said Detective Tim O'Meara. ``His
name kept popping up too many times.''
   O'Meara said Marts admitted setting the fatal fire, and ``tells
us he needs a lot of help.''
   The fire in August was in a building that contained both stores
and apartments. According to O'Meara, Marts told authorities he
didn't know anyone in the building when he set fire to packing
materials on the first floor.
   ``When he'd have a fight with someone, he'd vent his frustration
by setting fires,'' said Chief of Detectives Edward Wodnicki.
   ``If he would see a pile of garbage in an alley, something would
tell him to set it on fire,'' O'Meara said. ``A lot of the fires
were just garbage fires.''
   Marts was charged with arson in three other fires that damaged
property but caused no injuries.
   In one of those fires, prosecutors won an indictment Nov. 29
against Michael J. Gillon, 21, based on Marts' testimony. They said
they would move to drop charges against Gillon today.
   Detective Wayne Micek said police had spoken with Marts several
times over the last four months. Each time, he offered information
about where certain fires started, who was seen nearby or who was
running from the scene.
   Micek said officers examined the records of a number of fires and
noticed that Marts had been at the scene of several. ``It just
clicked,'' Micek said.

<HEAD>Court Lengthens Time Union Members Have to Sue Unions in North Carolina
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, reviving a North Carolina
lawsuit, today lengthened the time union members have to sue their
unions over alleged free-speech violations.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices ruled that such lawsuits do not have
to be filed within six months of a disputed incident, the deadline
imposed by the National Labor Relations Act for unfair labor
practice complaints.
   Instead, the court said, the deadline for free-speech lawsuits
filed under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act is to
be the same as the deadline for general personal injury lawsuits in
that same state.
   The decision reversed lower court rulings that a Charlotte, N.C.,
man had waited too long before suing his union.
   The appeals court said the man missed the six-month deadline, but
today's ruling made clear that a three-year deadline should have
been imposed.
   The lawsuit against the United Transportation Union by G.P. Reed,
a public transit employee in Charlotte and part-time
secretary-treasurer for the union's Local 1715, was filed within two
years after the dispute arose.
   Reed sued his union in 1985 after he was ordered to repay the
local $1,200 he previously had reimbursed himself for ``time lost''
from his fulltime employment.
   Reed alleges that the denial of his reimbursement amounted to
harassment for expressing his views on union matters.
   One section of the law he sued under protects union members'
right to voice disagreement with union policies, and allows members
to sue over alleged violations of that right. But in passing the
law, Congress did not specify what the deadline should be.
   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said
Reed's suit is more like a free-speech suit against some government
official than an unfair labor practice complaint.
   ``The six-month statute of limitations (for unfair labor practice
complaints) ... was not adopted with the distinct federal interest
in the free speech of union members in mind,'' Brennan said.
   Justice Byron R. White was the sole dissenter. He said a
six-month deadline should apply.
   The case is Reed vs. United Transportation Union, 87-1031.

   Sponsors of a law to compensate
Japanese-Americans who were forced to live in internment camps
during World War II say it would take 60 years to make reparations
under the spending plan proposed by President Reagan.
   But a spokeswoman for the White House budget office said today
the $20 million earmarked for the first year is considered adequate.
   ``Unless Congress appropriates the authorized maximum amount ...
many of the eligible recipients may die before receiving their token
compensation,'' Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, said Tuesday.
   Matsunaga and the other lawmakers who sponsored the 1988 law said
they would press the House and Senate budget committees to vastly
increase the $20 million in the president's 1990 budget for the
reparations.
   Up to $500 million can be appropriated in any single year until
$1.2 billion has been paid out.
   No payments have been made under the law, which promises $20,000
each to an estimated 60,000 survivors of internment camps, where
Americans of Japanese ancestry were forced to live from 1942 to 1946.
   Matsunaga called the Reagan proposal ``woefully inadquate'' and
expressed hope the new Congress ``will be sympathetic to our
request.''
   The senator said some of the survivors ``are in their 80s and 90s
and have been waiting more than 40 years for the apology and token
compensation provided by the 1988 act.'' The law requires the oldest
survivors be paid first.
   Barbara Clay, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and
Budget, said the amount is adequate for the first year of the
payments.
   ``The key issue is how fast the Justice Department can can spend
this money,'' she said. ``They must pay off the oldest people first,
so they cannot pay out the money until they find out who the oldest
people are. From the administration's standpoint, we believe $20
million is a reasonable amount for the first year of this program
for Justice to meet the intent of the law.''
   The sponsors said at Reagan's spending rate, it would take 60
years to complete the payments although the law has a 10-year
deadline to complete the payments.
   Rep. Norm Mineta, D-Calif., said that only 1,000 individuals
would be compensated under Reagan's first-year spending proposal,
and asked: ``Why has the president's vision narrowed now? Why did he
not remain committed to fight for the full $500 million funding to
honor his commitment and our nation's ideal?
   ``I ask President-elect Bush, `How much longer must they wait?'''
   ``The Justice Department is well ahead of expected schedules in
locating recipients,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif. ``There is
no reason to delay the process now. We are talking about a majority
of elderly citizens who may not be here in 5 or 10 years, much less
60 years.''
   The legislation provided apologies as well as the $20,000
tax-free payments.
   Reagan said last year the legislation ended ``a sad chapter in
American history in a way that reaffirms America's commitment to the
preservation of liberty and justice for all.''
   More than 120,000 Japanese-Americans were sent to internment
camps because the government believed they were security risks.
   In addition to benefiting Japanese-American internees, the
legislation authorizes payments of up to $12,000 for surviving
members of the Aleut Indian tribes who were removed from the
Aleutian Islands during the Japanese attack on those islands in 1942.
   It was early in 1942 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed
an order that said the War Department could designate military areas
from which people could be excluded.
   Later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of
Japanese ancestry from California, Washington and Oregon, and some
in Hawaii. The orders affected 77,000 U.S. citizens and 43,000 legal
and illegal resident aliens. All were taken to the camps.

<HEAD>Court Overturns Censorship In Intelligence Agency Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court overturned a military censor's
ruling and allowed publication of a news story criticizing the
director of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency and saying he will
soon be replaced.
   The court's decision Tuesday, widely reported in Israeli
newspapers, marked the first time a court had ever overruled the
military censors, who have broad discretion over publication of news
items in Israel.
   The disputed story in a weekly Tel Aviv newspaper, Ha'ir, did not
give the name of the Mossad head, which is never made public.
   It indicated the man was responsible for several of the Mossad's
recent failures, such as the discovery in West Germany of false
passports used by agents and events leading to the expulsion of
agents from Britain last year.
   The report, to be published in Friday's edition of Ha'ir, said
the director will be replaced in a matter of days.
   The director was the first to have risen from within the agency's
ranks. Israel radio said there are two candidates likely to succeed
him, including one Mossad official and one ``senior personality''
from outside the organization.
   The new appointment must be approved by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and Finance Minister Shimon Peres _ the heads of Israel's two
main political blocs.
   In overruling censorship on the story, the Supreme Court said the
press had a right to criticize public officials.
   The court upheld censorship of any description of the Mossad
chief, however, citing the man's personal safety.
   Under Israeli law, military censors are empowered to ban
publication of any news items deemed harmful to state security.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of a Boeing 737 was questioned again
today by investigators trying to determine why his plane's
apparently undamaged right engine was shut down long before the jet
crashed, while the burning left engine remained in operation.
   The Civil Aviation Authority said it would order stepped-up
inspections of engines on three types of airplanes as a result of
the crash Sunday of the British Midland Airways jetliner.
   The new inspections will apply to Boeing 737-400s, the type of
aircraft involved the crash, as well as Boeing 737-300s and Airbus
A320s, which have similar engines, the authority said in a statement.
   The statement came after the Transport Department recommended
more frequent inspections of Boeing 737 engines. A communique issued
by the department's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it was
still looking into the possibility that both engines ``might have
suffered a related failure.''
   It did not refer to suggestions in the British media that the
pilot shut down the wrong engine when a fire alarm went off.
   The reasons for shutting down the engine ``are not yet clear and
are still under investigation,'' the comunique said.
   The pilot, Capt. Kevin Hunt, whose back and legs were broken in
the crash, was interviewed for 45 minutes at Leicester Royal
Infirmary, said the hospital's deputy general manager, Carol
Henshall. Hunt answered preliminary questions Tuesday.
   The jet plunged into an embankment a half-mile short of the
runway at East Midlands Airport in central England, where it was
trying to make an emergency landing. Forty-four people died and 82
were injured.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said Hunt had reported a fire in
the right engine of the new Boeing 737-400 shortly after it took off
from London's Heathrow Airport for Belfast.
   Channon told the House of Commons Tuesday that investigators
found evidence of fire in the left engine, but no evidence of fire
or mechanical damage in the right engine.
   Britain's tabloid newspapers concluded today that Hunt had
mistakenly shut down the right engine, believing it was on fire,
instead of the left engine.
   ``Fatal Error'' said the Daily Star; ``Pilot Shut Off the Wrong
Engine'' said the Sun; ``Error on the Flight Deck'' said Today.
   The British Airline Pilots Association called the newspaper
reports ``outrageous'' and ``without a shred of evidence.'' Aviation
experts said it was highly unlikely the pilot could have confused
the two engines, given the cockpit layout and the system of
doublechecks between pilot and co-pilot.
   Mrs. Henshall said that after Hunt's meeting with investigators
he ``is obviously a lot happier that they have all the relevant
facts.''
   She said some of the ``wilder headlines'' had been kept from the
pilot but he had been made aware by friends and colleagues of the
news reports.
   Asked if Hunt had denied them, Mrs. Henshall said: ``That is a
comment I couldn't make.''
   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m. Government sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Hunt reported at 8:06 p.m.: ``I have an
engine on fire.'' Then, at 8:14 p.m., the sources said he told
traffic control: ``I am shutting down the starboard (right) engine.''
   The plane crashed 12 minutes later at 8:26 p.m.
   Channon refused Tuesday to speculate on what happened, saying he
wouldn't rule out anything including pilot error or sabotage, though
he said ``I don't think sabotage is very likely.''
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accidents
Investigation Branch, put the odds against a double-engine failure
at 10 million-to-1.
   Group Captain John Tritton of the Guild of Air Pilots said ``I
find it unbelievable'' that the pilot identified the wrong engine on
fire ``because the checks are done so carefully by both pilots.''
   Asked if the warning system itself could go wrong, Capt. John
Guntrip, also a guild member, said: ``It is possible. It has been
known in the past. There have very occasionally been false fire
warnings on aircraft.''
   Aviation experts say the investigation into the fire in the left
engine will focus on the possibility of a broken turbine blade,
mechanical failure, contaminated fuel, problems in the fuel feed
system, faulty maintenance and an explosion in the engine's
combustion chamber.
   The plane broke into three main sections. Recovery crews prepared
today to remove the crumpled center section, including the two wings
and two engines, from the embankment beside England's main
north-south M1 highway about 100 miles north of London.
   The cockpit, tail section and ``black boxes'' which record
cockpit flight data and conversations have already been taken to the
government Air Accidents Investigation Branch at Farnborough,
outside London.

<HEAD>General Reportedly Quits Over Effects of Uprising On Israeli Troops</HEAD>

   A senior Israeli general has resigned after
complaining that efforts to put down the Palestininan uprising in
the occupied territories could damage the moral character of
soldiers, a newspaper reported today.
   Also today, the army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, was
quoted as saying troops can never quell the rebellion because it is
a political struggle.
   The reports are likely to increase the debate among Israelis over
the army's role in combating the 13-month uprising in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Five more Palestinians were wounded in the uprising today, and
three Palestinians were indicted in the firebombing of an Israeli
passenger bus.
   The mass-circulation daily Maariv reported that Maj. Gen.
Menachem Einan was leaving his job as the army's logistics chief
over concern about the impact of the uprising on Israeli soldiers.
   ``I am very worried about the level of morality of Israel
soldiers in the territories,'' Einan was quoted as saying. ``We are
making them face provocations that inspire maliciousness all too
quickly.''
   An army spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Einan would
step down Friday to take a civilian job. However, the spokesman, who
demanded anonymity, said the resignation had nothing to do with the
reported criticism.
   The military command refused to allow The Associated Press to
interview Einan and made no immediate statement on the report.
   In the interview with Maariv, Einan traced his worries to the
government's handling of its 1982 Lebanon invasion, which turned
into a three-year war instead of the planned limited campaign. He
said the result showed him the military should sometimes question
what political leaders are saying.
   ``My big lesson is that perhaps there are times when the fighting
military echelons cannot accept to the last letter the instructions
given by political echelons,'' he said.
   In another report, the Jerusalem Post said Shomron told a
closed-door session of Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee on Tuesday that the army was limited in its ability to
break up the ``intefadeh,'' the Arabic word used for the uprising.
   ``There is no such thing as eradicating the intefadeh, because in
essence it expressed the struggle of nationalism,'' the paper quoted
him as saying.
   Israeli newspapers said today the army indicted three
Palestinians on murder charges for throwing three firebombs at an
Israeli passenger bus Oct. 30 in the West Bank city of Jericho. Five
Israelis _ a soldier, a mother, and her three small children _ died
in the attack.
   A total of 15 Israelis have been killed as a result of the
uprising in the territories Israel took from Arab neighbors in the
1967 Middle East War. At least 349 Palestinians have been killed,
most by army gunfire.
   Israeli troops today shot and wounded five young Palestinians in
clashes in the Gaza Strip refugee camps of Nusseirat and Khan Yunis
and the West Bank village of Ein Abush, Arab doctors said. Among the
wounded was a 12-year-old shot in the left thigh. The army said it
was checking the reports.

   Money for specific strategic weapons such as
the MX and Midgetman missiles and the Star Wars program should be
pooled to force the White House and Congress to make tough spending
choices over the next decade, the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee said today.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said his proposal would allow the
Republican administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress to
bridge serious differences on defense spending policy and ``build a
strategic consensus.''
   ``We can expect only a flat defense budget and the strategic
program of the Reagan administration simply won't fit. Something has
to be done and confrontation isn't likely to accomplish it,'' Aspin
said in a speech to the National Press Club.
   He said approximately $31 billion a year should be made available
for all strategic weapons, with none of it earmarked for any
specific weapon.
   Under the 10-year plan, money would be pooled for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars; the B-52, B-1B and
B-2 stealth bombers; and the Trident, MX and Midgetman missiles.
   The annual budget for the pool would remain constant at about the
$31 billion level _ the total budget for the strategic programs in
1989 _ with adjustments for inflation, Aspin said.
   He said spending for weapons systems usually begins slowly,
increases midway through production and tails off at the end. The
program would permit tradeoffs in which more money could be spent on
a weapons system in the middle of production, Aspin said.
   ``The question is no longer merely either-or. It is also sooner
or later,'' he said.
   The program would force Congress and the new administration under
President-elect Bush to decide what specific weapon systems should
be purchased and deployed and which should be delayed, the committee
chairman suggested.
   ``This great pot of strategic programs and funding I'm proposing
would also expand enormously the range of alternatives at the
disposal of policymakers,'' Aspin said. ``Right now, these issues
are arbitrarily straight-jacketed.''
   For example, Aspin and other Democrats in Congress have favored
the truck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman missile while the Reagan
administration has proposed scrapping the weapon.
   Aspin said his plan would let research and development funding
for the Midgetman begin in fiscal 1990 with possible depoloyment in
1995.
   To compensate for moving forward on the Midgetman, Aspin
suggested slowing down stealth bomber purchases for two years and
limiting spending on Star Wars to its current annual level of $4
billion through 1996.
   ``Now is the time for Democrats and Republicans, White House and
Congress, to put all the weapon systems into the pot, take a long,
10-year view, work the trade-offs and build a strategic consensus,''
Aspin said.

<HEAD>Text Of Statement By Chemical Weapons Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the official English text of the declaration
issued at the end of the international conference on chemical
weapons.
   The representatives of states participating in the Conference on
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, bringing together states
parties to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and other interested states
in Paris from 7 to 11 January 1989, solemnly declare the following:
   1. The participating states are determined to promote
international peace and security throughout the world in accordance
with the Charter of the United Nations and to pursue effective
disarmament measures. In this context, they are determined to
prevent any recourse to chemical weapons by completely eliminating
them. They solemnly affirm their commitments not to use chemical
weapons and condemn such use. They recall their serous concern at
recent violations as established and condemned by the competent
organs of the United Nations. They support the humanitarian
assistance given to the victims affected by chemical weapons.
   2. The participating states recognize the importance and
continuing validity of the protocol for the prohibitions of the use
in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and bacteriological
methods of warfare, signed on 17 June 1925 in Geneva. The states
parties to the protocol solemnly reaffirm the prohibition as
established in it. They call upon all states which have not yet done
so to accede to the protocol.
   3. The participating states stress the necessity of concluding,
at an early date, a convention on the prohibition of the
development, production, stockpiling and use of all chemical
weapons, and on their destruction. This convention shall be global
and comprehensive and effectively verifiable. It should be of
unlimited duration. To this end, they call on the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva to redouble its efforts, as a matter of
urgency, to resolve expeditiously the remaining issues and to
conclude the convention at the earliest date. All states are
requested to make, in an appropriate way, a significant contribution
to the negotiations in Geneva by undertaking efforts in the relevant
fields. The participating states therefore believe that any state
wishing to contribute to these negotiations should be able to do so.
In addition, in order to achieve as soon as possible the
indispensable universal character of the convention, they call upon
all states to become parties thereto as soon as it is concluded.
   4. The states participating are gravely concerned by the growing
danger posed to international peace and security by the risk of the
use of chemical weapons as long as such weapons remain and are
spread. In this context, they stress the need for the early
conclusion and entry into force of the convention, which will be
established on a non-discriminatory basis. They deem it necessary,
in the meantime, for each state to exercise restraint and to act
responsibly in accordance with the purpose of the present
declaration.
   5. The participating states confirm their full support for the
United Nations in the discharge of its indispensable role, in
conformity with its charter. They affirm that the United Nations
provides a framework and an instrument enabling the international
community to exercise vigilance with respect to the prohibition of
the use of chemical weapons. They confirm their suport for
approriate and effective steps taken by the United Nations in this
respect in conformity with its charter. They futher reaffirm their
full support for the secretary general in carrying out his
responsibilities for investigations in the event of alleged
violations of the Geneva protocol. They express their wish for early
completion of the work undertaken to strengthen the efficiency of
existing procedures and call for the cooperation of all states, in
order to facilitate the action of the secretary general.
   6. The participating states, recalling the final document of the
first special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted
to Disarmament in 1978, underline the need to pursue with
determination their efforts to secure general and complete
disarmament under effective international control, so as to ensure
the right of all states to peace and security.

   Olympic diver Bruce Kimball pleaded guilty
today to drunken-driving manslaughter in the deaths of two
teen-agers Aug. 1 and could receive up to 22 years in prison at
sentencing Jan. 30.
   Prosecutors said the 25-year-old athlete had a blood-alcohol
reading of 0.2 percent, twice the legal limit, the night his car
plowed into a group of teen-agers at a hangout in Brandon, killing
two and injuring four shortly before the Olympic trials.
   The athlete pleaded guilty an hour into his trial today to two
counts of manslaughter while driving under the influence and three
counts of causing great bodily injury while driving under the
influence.
   Kimball competed in the Olympic trials but failed to make the
U.S. team.
   Assistant State Attorney John Skye said a witness at the accident
scene saw Kimball get out of the car, beat his fist on the ground
and say, ``There go the Olympics.''
   Killed in the accident were Robbie Bedell, 19, and Kevin Gossic,
16.

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa said
today that the 5{-year state of emergency will be lifted at
midnight, providing for the release of hundreds of political
prisoners, a government spokesman said.
   Premadasa, who took office nine days ago, had promised to end the
emergency in an effort to chart a more peaceful course for this
Indian Ocean island nation ravaged by ethnic violence since 1983.
   A military official, however, said security forces will retain
the power to arrest and detain suspects without charge for up to 90
days and search houses without warrants under an anti-terrorism law
adopted four years before the state of emergency. The official
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The state of emergency has been extended on a month-by-month
basis since May 1983. Premadasa had already vowed it would not be
renewed on its next expiration date, Sunday.
   But today he told his Cabinet the emergency would be lifted three
days early, according to Festus Perera, minister of information and
spokesman for the Cabinet.
   The state of emergency empowered security forces to arrest and
detain people without charge, dispose of bodies without inquests and
search houses without warrants.
   On Tuesday, Premadasa told top government officials: ``We have
lived under emergency regulations for now more than five years. I
feel that is enough time for everybody.''
   About the time the announcement was made, a small bomb exploded
in a market in central Colombo, injuring two people. Police said
they did not know whether the bombing was related to the ethnic or
political strife or stemmed from a private dispute.
   Sri Lanka, famed for its beaches and gemstones, fell into a
vicious cycle of violence in 1983 as extremists from the Tamil
minority launched an insurgency seeking autonomy from the Sinhalese
majority.
   More than 8,500 people _ mostly Sinhalese _ have since died in
massacres, ambushes and guerrilla battles. The dead include more
than 600 Indian soldiers, part of a peacekeeping force sent to Sri
Lanka at the government's invitation in July 1987 to try to disarm
Tamil insurgents.
   In his campaign for president, Premadasa pledged to press for
withdrawal of the 50,000 Indian troops. A few thousand were reported
to be pulled out earlier this month.
   In addition, more than 650 government supporters _ mostly
Sinhalese _ have been killed by Sinhalese extremists who opposed
former President Junius R. Jayewardene's efforts to make peace with
the Tamils by granting them some autonomy in northern and eastern
Sri Lanka.
   Jayewardene, who initiated the state of emergency, had governed
Sri Lanka since 1977. The Constitution barred him from seeking a
third term.
   Premadasa, prime minister under Jayewardene, won the Dec. 19
presidential election and was sworn in Jan. 2.
   Within five days, 574 political prisoners who had been held
without charge under the emergency were freed. About 1,800 more
political prisoners were still being held, but Premadasa said all
would be freed as quickly as possible.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the nation.

   The Phoenix Gazette on testing airport security with fake bombs:
   ``Congratulations!'', the note said. ``You have found our phony
bomb! We are TF-1, the largest television network in France, and it
is with due respect and great pleasure that ... we found your
company to be keen and consistent with security matters.''
   Authorities at the freight offices of three airlines at Kennedy
International Airport, where the fake bombs were found, were not
amused. French television reporter Alain Chaillou and his American
producer, Bruce Frankel, were arrested after they delivered their
make-believe bombs.
   Certainly there have been more sophisticated gestures by the
media for the sake of a story. But probing the integrity of security
... is certainly a benevolent undertaking.
   There are risks, of course. Alain Chaillou and Bruce Frankel are
charged with falsifying an incident, a federal offense, and face
prison sentences if found guilty. But the benefits of their crude
charade quickly became apparent, as Air France announced that
because of the incident the airline would inspect every cargo
shipment.
   Alain Chaillou and Bruce Frankel did what journalists are
supposed to do, serve the truth fearlessly.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the safety of older airplanes:
   Ever since a passenger plane flying in Hawaii lost a chunk of its
fuselage, we have been hearing a lot about stepped-up inspection of
aged aircraft. ...
   When an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 sprang a leak and lost cabin
pressure at 31,000 feet the other day, that was just one further
sharp reminder that the problem demands even more attention.
   The program begun by the Federal Aviation Administration ... is
laudable, but it still needs tightening. The program's deficiencies
are symbolized in the two aforementioned episodes.
   A crack in one plane has just been detected. But the system
missed the flaw that caused an emergency landing in Charleston
(W.Va.) when cabin air suddenly wooshed out through a hole in the
roof.
   That kind of discrepancy tends to make travelers nervous, and
rightly so.

   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on illiteracy:
   An estimated 23 million people in this country cannot read books
or newspapers. They cannot read street signs, restaurant menus, job
applications or welfare forms. Nor can they understand a bus or
subway schedule.
   An additional 35 million are functional illiterates, which means
they can read just well enough to scrape by.
   Last April, Congress approved a $50 million-a-year program to
deal with the national disgrace of illiteracy. But given the federal
government's fiscal constraints, the states, counties and cities
will bear the major responsibility for dealing with this problem.
   Stemming the rising incidence of illiteracy will require a
substantial investment of time and money. But the costs of failing
to do so are much higher.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on abortion rights:
   The Supreme Court has decided to review Missouri's law regulating
abortions.
   That won't necessarily lead to a reconsideration of Roe vs. Wade,
the 1973 court decision legalizing abortion nationwide, but neither
is it a decision that people concerned with protecting privacy and
reproductive rights can welcome.
   Should, for example, abortions be performed in public hospitals?
The Missouri law forbids this; a decision by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals last July struck that provision down.
   Can a state require doctors to perform viability tests for
fetuses when the pregnancy is beyond its 19th week? Missouri law
requires this, in another provision the appeals court ruled against.
   What is the consequence of a state declaring that ``the life of
each human being begins at conception?'' Missouri declares this, in
yet another provision thrown out by the appeals court. ...
   The Missouri case is an important measure of the Supreme Court's
respect for women's hard-won rights to privacy and reproductive
freedom. They are rights that ... all Americans should hope the
Supreme Court will continue to hold ... in esteem.

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on Emperor Hirohito's funeral:
   Who attends Emperor Hirohito's upcoming funeral may be as
important a symbol to some Japanese as the monarch's
long-anticipated death.
   New Zealand and Australia, two countries where memories of the
brutal Japanese Army have not yet faded, are debating whether to
send any prominent officials at all.
   The Japanese government undoubtedly will be scrutinizing the list
of other attendees, hoping to gauge the country's international
acceptance as a peace-loving economic superpower. ...
   Photographs of mourners overcome with grief outside the Imperial
Palace make many Westerners wonder how one man could garner and
retain such respect.
   After all, Hirohito's 62-year reign included a catastrophic war
and the declaration that he was not a ``god incarnate.'' And he had
little to do with the most dynamic economic recovery in Japanese
history.

   Battle Creek (Mich.) Enquirer on poverty in America:
   President Lyndon Johnson declared war in his first State of the
Union message: a War on Poverty. ``It will not be a short or easy
struggle,'' he predicted on Jan. 8, 1964.
   Twenty-five years later, Americans are better off, but battles
still need to be fought for select groups.
   The poverty level was 13.5 percent in 1986, which translates to
32.5 million Americans living in poverty. ... Since 1964, the lowest
nationwide poverty rate was 11.1 percent in 1973, which climbed to
14 percent by 1983.
   In 1986, the poverty rate was 10.5 percent for whites. However,
rates were 33.1 percent for blacks and 28.2 percent for Hispanics.
...
   In terms of age, the highest poverty rates are among young
families. ...
   If President-elect George Bush adheres to the 1988 Republican
platform, no new major federal anti-poverty programs appear likely.
So if the war is to continue, local and state efforts need to focus
on:
   Encouraging our youth to get the education they need to stay out
of the poverty cycle. ...
   Better training of minorities and women for jobs in the local
work force. ...
   Voluntary or mandatory action to get quality day care so single
parents can get available jobs.

   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on Oliver North:
   The government's case against Oliver North is slowly crumbling
away, and that's neither surprising nor lamentable.
   After nine months of costly legal preparations for trial of the
former White House aide, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has
asked for dismissal of the two charges that were central to the
prosecution.
   He had little choice but to drop the conspiracy and theft counts
because of the Reagan administration's refusal to release classified
material a judge said North needs to get a fair trial.
   With the heart of this case gone, Walsh should now move to drop
the remaining 12 charges and put an end to this fruitless endeavor.

   The sensitivity of the evidence is something the public will have
to accept on the word of ... Walsh, who had promised to put up a
fight for it. ...
   If a former president or even a sitting president can give
evidence that could help a defendant, he should be made to do so.
   A constitutional case can be made for executive immunity when the
issue is between the executive and Congress, but a president should

   The move to dismiss conspiracy and theft charges against North
adds yet another troubling conflict in the Iran-Contra affair. ...
   The American people are simply left with no choice but to trust
the judgment of those keeping the classified information. They are
left no choice but to accept Walsh's decision about what charges he
can most effectively prosecute.
   But North still would face 12 other charges. Those charges should

   The Daily News, Longview, Wash., on Democrats and vote
projections:
   The Democratic Governors Association called a news conference in
Los Angeles (Jan. 4) to urge Congress to approve nationwide uniform
poll closing.
   The Democratic Party may be as bad off as some observers
suggested. Its governors _ who should be providing some party
leadership _ are hung up on network predictions in presidential
races.
   They imply that these projections are decreasing voter
participation by convincing supporters of projected losers that they
have no reason to vote. But November's race produced nothing to
support that idea.
   Their complaint really boils down to the lack of suspense in the
past couple of presidential races for voters on the West Coast.
   That doesn't call for legislation that would inconvenience much
of the rest of the nation. Suspense will return to the presidential
race when the Democrats deliver a candidate who can avoid being
buried in an electoral landslide.

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on 30 years of Fidel
Castro:
   Thirty years ago, (Fidel) Castro was a youthful liberator and the
foe of a corrupt tyranny. Cuba's economy was among Latin America's
most advanced.
   Many positive changes were to come in health standards, literacy
and basic social services.
   Cuba today remains poor, unfree and dependent. Free speech and a
free press are stifled. ... Its record of human rights abuses
remains an international scandal, the worst in Latin America.
   So far, Castro has resisted the Soviet lead of economic and
social liberalization, and modification of orthodox communism. He
continues to expouse a Cold War with the United States, and as long
as he does, his nation remains rooted in stagnation.

   Herald and Review, Decatur, Ill., on nuclear waste:
   Nuclear plants had a record year in 1988: They provided a full 20
percent of the nation's electricity. ... But another report should
give the rest of us pause.
   In the same week, the non-profit research organization Public
Citizen said 1987 was a dismal year for nuclear power industry.
   In 1987, the private agency said, there were at least 492
violations of safety regulations at U.S. nuclear power plants.
Moreover, there were nearly 3,000 ``mishaps,'' 430 emergency
shutdowns and 104,000 incidents in which workers were exposed to
measurable doses of radiation. ...
   The gravest problems facing mankind today involve pollution and
the environment. Despite mandates from the federal government that
every state establish hazardous waste sites and low-level nuclear
waste storage sites, no one wants such facilities in their back
yard. ...
   In the past, we tended to assume we would solve the questions of
what to do with radioactive waste and spent materials ``up the
road.'' Now that road appears to be a dead end. It's possible
there's no place on Earth to put this stuff safely.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on federal pay raises:
   President Reagan has endorsed a proposal by an independent salary
commission to increase substantially the pay rates of members of
Congress and other federal employees. Under current law, the salary
hikes will take effect unless Congress specifically votes against
them. ...
   Congress would be doing itself _ and the country _ a big favor by
going along with the proposal.
   It will take courage because there has been substantial public
criticism of the plan, which calls for a whopping 50 percent
increase in congressional pay _ from $89,500 to $135,000. ...
   As part of the pay package, senators and representatives would
have to give up the odious practice of accepting outside honorariums
from special interest groups for speeches and other approaches. ...
   Accepting a pay increase _ even a big one _ under these
conditions is defensible. Continuing the practice of accepting
outside payments from special interest groups is not.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on federal pay raises:
   Silence from this carping corner as Congress moved inexorably
toward a 50 percent pay hike for itself may have seemed tacit
acceptance of its wisdom _ or inevitability.
   Perish the thought. We think the idea stinks.
   Election to Congress is a public service. Those who opt for such
service shouldn't have to sell the family silverware to do so, but
they shouldn't expect to get even moderately rich while doing so. If
$135,000 a year isn't moderately rich, it'll do 'til the real thing
arrives.
   Sure it's costly to live in Washington, but the thousands of
District of Columbia residents not at the top of the federal pay
scale manage to do it on a lot less than $135,000 a year.
   Washington is costly _ just look at your 1988 taxes on the form
you'll fill out soon to pay for that profligacy.
   But before you do, why not send a message to Congress: Until they
do a 50 percent better job, their employers have decided not to
grant them a 50 percent pay hike.

   Philadelphia Inquirer on Cambodia:
   Ten years ago this month the Vietnamese army marched into Phnom
Penh, putting an end to the rule of the notorious Khmer Rouge
regime, which had killed one million Kampucheans (Cambodians) in its
warped attempt to create a communist Arcadia.
   This year, squeezed by its Soviet backers, Hanoi has pledged to
pull its troops out of Kampuchea (Cambodia) by the end of 1989.
   But without the presence of Vietnamese troops, well-armed Khmer
Rouge guerrillas could eventually march back into Phnom Penh.
   The United States is in a position to prevent such a disaster,
but it can't do it alone.
   The United States should pressure China to stop sending arms to
the Khmer Rouge, something the Chinese at last seem willing to do.
   The United States should also encourage all the key players to
agree to a formula for an interim government headed by Prince
Sihanouk, hopefully as a prelude to free elections.
   Here, the United States could use a promise of improved relations
with Vietnam, complete with economic aid, as a carrot to get Hanoi
to cooperate.

<TEXT>
   A tax break for Brown University
professors that dates back to the days of King George III is being
phased out but still gives 32 faculty members a discount on their
property taxes, officials said.
   The Ivy League school has been phasing out the break, which
applies to the first $10,000 of the assessed value of a professor's
home, since 1966. Brown acted because of complaints that the tax
break costs the city money and is unfair.
   All newly hired or promoted professors since then have been
required to forgo their right to the exemption.
   ``Every year, there are a few less,'' said city tax assessor
Theodore Littler.
   Joyce M.K. Lewis, tax assessor in the suburb of Barrington, said
the exemption dates to the university's charter, issued by King
George in 1764.
   Originally, Brown tenured professors were exempt from all
property taxes, but the university and the Legislature narrowed the
exemption during the Civil War, Lewis said.
   When the university started phasing out the tax break 23 years
ago, 135 professors took advantage of it, 90 of whom lived in
Providence.
   Last year, the exemption for 25 city residents cost the city
$5,971, said Ancelin Lynch, university associate director for
government and community relations. That works out to about $240 per
professor.
   The school has 390 tenured professors as of last year.

   The commander of the U.N. observers
appointed to monitor the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola said
today he is satisfied he will be able to conduct an independent
verification of the departure.
   South Africa and UNITA guerrillas fighting the Angolan government
have expressed doubt that an independent verification will be
possible.
   ``I think there will be no difficulties in carrying this
assignment out,'' Gen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes of Brazil told
reporters when asked about the ability of the 70 military and 20
civilian observers to verify the numbers of departing Cuban troops.
   But he also said the success of the 27-month mission depended on
the ``good will'' of the Angolan and Cuban governments, who agreed
to the phased withdrawal Dec. 22 and who are to supply the precise
numbers of Cuban troops when the monitoring procedure officially
begins April 1. South Africa and UNITA leaders have questioned the
wisdom of relying on such figures.
   Cuba first sent troops to Angola in July 1975 to support members
of the Angolan Popular Liberation Movement (MPLA), who were fighting
South African and U.S.-backed UNITA guerrillas for control of the
Portuguese colony that was to become independent in November of that
year.
   UNITA, or the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, whose guerrillas number an estimated 25,000, is not party to
the agreement signed by Angola, Cuba and South Africa. The group
claims it is continuing attacks on Angolan forces in the south of
the country.
   On Tuesday a symbolic contingent of 450 Cuban troops departed by
plane for Havana. They reportedly were followed today by about 1,000
more troops on a Soviet ship.
   Under the terms of the U.S.-brokered agreement, 3,000 Cuban
troops are to have left this southern African nation by April 1.
Ferreira Gomes said he had been informed all 3,000 would be gone by
Sunday.
   He declined to give figures on departures through today, saying
it was up to the the Angolans and Cubans to make the figures public.
   Ferreira Gomes said under the terms of the agreement, designed to
bring independence to the South African controlled territory of
Namibia, both Cuban troops and arms were to be sent back to Cuba.
   He said 50,000 was the ``basic figure'' for the number of Cuban
troops to be withdrawn. But he added Angolan and Cuban officials
were to furnish exact figures on Cuban troops in Angola once the
U.N. observer mission is officially established April 1, when the
entire team is to have arrived in the country.
   He said the monitoring procedure of the unarmed observer force
will consist of checking the number of troops departing from four
ports and one airport against lists furnished by the Cubans and
Angolans.
   The general said the Angolan government is committed to providing
transport when needed to the U.N. observers, who have the mandate to
travel anywhere in the country.
   Road travel is difficult if not impossible in most of Angola
because of land mines and the presence of UNITA guerrillas.
   The Angolan government has requested U.N. assistance to defray
the estimated $800 million cost of the Cuban withdrawal. The U.N.
Security Council recently approved a $20.4 million budget for the
observer mission through mid-1991.
   The members of the observer mission are Algeria, Congo, India,
Jordan, Norway, Spain, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Brazil and
Argentina.

<HEAD>Finance Chairman Hints No Change in Tax for Catastrophic Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, indicated today that Congress will leave intact
the tax increase on older Americans that pays for new protecting
them against costs of catastrophic illness.
   ``We might have some oversight hearings, but they would be more
to publicize'' details of the program than to determine how the tax
should be changed, Bentsen said at a news conference.
   The Texas Democrat acknowledged receiving a lot of letters
protesting the new tax, but he said ``the mail shows a lot of people
don't know details of the bill and there is a great deal of
misinformation on that legislation.''
   Scores of House members are co-sponsoring signed bills to repeal
or modify the new tax.
   Bentsen said much of the outcry is coming from wealthy retired
people who want more of the costs of catastrophic care financed by
taxpayers in general.
   On another topic, Bentsen said he expects Congress to crack down
on leveraged buyouts of corporations. He offered no details,
although one likely method would be to curtail the interest
deduction allowed on money borrowed to finance certain takeovers.
   ``I want to make sure the cure is not worse than the situation we
are facing now,'' Bentsen said. His committee and the House Ways and
Means Committee already have scheduled hearings on the issue.
   The former vice presidential candidate expressed hope that
President-elect George Bush will make substantial changes in the
budget that President Reagan submitted Monday. He said the 50
percent pay raise and mail allowances Reagan recommended for
Congress were excessive.
   Even with the new tax on the elderly, Bentsen said, the
catastrophic protection ``is the best buy in town. There's nothing
in the private sector that offers what it offers at those prices.''
   The catastrophic bill was enacted last year to protect
Medicare-eligible elderly Americans against costs of an illness that
could wreck them financially. The program is estimated to cost about
$33 billion over five years.
   Most of the cost will be paid by a surtax on several million
elderly people whose incomes are high enough that they pay a tax on
part of their Social Security benefits. This would hit only those
who pay at least $150 a year in income taxes. Congressional aides
say this exempts a typical couple with income under $11,000.
   The surtax for 1989 is 15 percent of the income tax paid, with a
maximum of $800 per individual, or $1,600 for a couple if both
spouses are eligible for Medicare. The surtax will jump to 25
percent next year and then rise by up to one percentage point a year.
   The premium for Part B Medicare coverage, for doctors' services,
has been raised to $31.10 a month to help pay for the
catastrophic-care program.

   A teen-age girl's body is rejecting a

miles from San Francisco.
   Garza, a 15-year-old high school admirer, knew Donna had a
degenerative heart disease and told his parents he wanted his heart
donated to her when he died. Days later, he died of a cerebral
hemorrhage.
   ``In 5 to 10 percent of the (transplant) cases, there is chronic
rejection,'' said Nancy Millhouse, a spokeswoman at San Francisco's
Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center, where the transplant occurred.
   ``She's been through a lot and she's handled herself well,'' Ms.
Millhouse said of the girl.
   Donna, who will turn 18 on April 1, said she is anxious to get a

   A federal judge began final instructions to the
jury this morning in the trial of two Teamsters officials charged in
a $700,000 payroll-padding scheme that allegedly involved the late
union boss Jackie Presser.
   Harold Friedman and Anthony Hughes were accused of racketeering
and embezzlement in the 2{-month-old trial. Presser, president of
the 1.6 million member union, also was charged in the case but died
in July at age 60.
   The jury received instructions from U.S. District Judge George W.
White before they were to begin deliberations. The trial opened Oct.
24 and included testimony from some 80 witnesses.
   The government said Hughes, 52, was a ``ghost employee'' at
Bakery Workers Local 19, which is affiliated with Teamsters Local
507 here. Dozens of grocers and bakers testified for the government
that they had no contact with Hughes.
   Much of Tuesday's closing arguments concerned Presser's actions
from the early 1970s through 1981, when Hughes and three other men
allegedly were paid a combined $700,000 from union dues without
working.
   ``The defense would have you believe all this was Jackie
Presser's responsibility,'' prosecutor Stephen Jigger said.
   ``Poor, powerless Harold Friedman, living in the fear of Jackie
Presser. I submit to you that the evidence in this case indicates
not only what Jackie Presser did but also what Harold Friedman and
Anthony Hughes did.''
   Friedman, 66, a Teamsters international vice president and Ohio's
most powerful Teamster, testified that Presser had unquestioned
power at Local 507, where he served as secretary-treasurer while he
was international president.
   ``The evidence demonstrates abuse of union office by Harold
Friedman, Anthony Hughes and Jackie Presser for the benefit of their
friends and cronies,'' Jigger said.
   The defense said it was Presser who hired John A. ``Jack'' Nardi
Jr., the son of a dead reputed organized crime figure, George Argie,
an admitted past operator of an illegal gambling operation, and
Allen Friedman, who is no relation to Harold Friedman. Each
testified for the prosecution that they were paid and did little
work, if any.
   The defense said Allen Friedman often was too ill to work.
   Harold Friedman was accused of two counts each of labor
racketeering, embezzlement and filing false reports with the Labor
Department; Hughes was charged with two counts of labor racketeering
and one of embezzlement.
   Defendant Friedman's attorney, Paul Cambria, said his client put
in long hours of work for his members and that his participation in
a scheme to embezzle members' money ``just doesn't make any sense.''
   ``I ask you not to be misled,'' Cambria said. ``You must
determine whether my client was a thief. Jackie Presser is gone.
Whether it had a lot to do with him or not is another story. My
client is on trial, not Jackie Presser.''
   John R. Climaco, Presser's former attorney, has said that
Presser's defense would have been that the FBI authorized him to
hire the ``ghost employees'' to enhance and protect his status as an
FBI informant.
   But prosecutors contend Presser couldn't have been authorized to
hire ``ghost employees'' because they were working as early as 1972
and Presser didn't become an FBI informant until 1977. Harold
Friedman's attorney said last week that Presser was a government
informant in 1963.
   The trial culminated the U.S. Justice Department and the
Department of Labor's six-year effort to uncover wrongdoing in the
Cleveland power base of Presser, who rose to the presidency of the
nation's largest union in 1983 and held the job until his death.
   Presser was the fourth of the last five Teamsters presidents to
be indicted; he inherited the job from Roy Williams when Williams
was sent to prison for conspiring to bribe a U.S. senator.

   Olympic diver Bruce Kimball pleaded guilty
today to drunken-driving manslaughter in the deaths of two
teen-agers Aug. 1 and could receive up to 22 years in prison.
   Prosecutors said the 25-year-old athlete had a blood-alcohol
reading of 0.2 percent, twice the legal limit, the night his
speeding car plowed into a group of teen-agers outside a hangout in
Brandon, killing two and injuring four.
   Kimball pleaded guilty an hour into his trial today to two counts
of manslaughter while driving under the influence and three counts
of causing great bodily injury while driving under the influence.
Sentencing was set for Jan. 30.
   ``He did it for the right reasons. He did not want to put the
parents of the families through a horrible trial ... or our
family,'' Kimball's father, University of Michigan diving coach Dick
Kimball, said though sobs.
   At the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Kimball won a silver medal.
   Despite the accident, he competed in the Olympic trials for the
Seoul games, bringing protests from those demanding greater limits
on drunken driving. His scores were not high enough, however, and he
failed to make the team.
   Assistant State Attorney John Skye said a witness at the accident
saw Kimball get out of the car, beat his fist on the ground and say,
``There go the Olympics.''
   Killed in the accident were Robbie Bedell, 19, and Kevin Gossic,
16.
   During opening arguments, defense attorney Lee Fugate said
Kimball acknowledged that he had been drinking and driving. But he
said that it was dark and that the crowd he hit was in the road.
   Skye said Kimball was going an estimated 75 mph at the time of
the accident.

   A Pan Am Boeing 747 flying from Frankfurt to New
Delhi made an emergency landing in Moscow after an oil leak prompted
the crew to shut down one of the four engines, Tass said.
   The airliner was flying over Aktyubinsk in Kazakhstan on Tuesday
night when it developed the oil leak, and it flew 950 miles to
Moscow for the emergency landing, the official news agency reported.
   The jumbo jet, which was carrying more than 300 passengers,
landed without difficulty, Tass said.
   Pan Am sent another plane to Moscow to carry the passengers to
their destination. The repaired plane flew back to Frankfurt today.

   Bill boxes outfitted with combination
locks to foil would-be thieves at the new Legislative Office
Building work so well they even keep out their owners.
   ``We need a safecracker,'' complained one legislative official.
``The supervisor of the bill room ought to be (bank robber) Willie
Sutton.''
   The 697 boxes, which cost about $10,000, are stuffed daily with
legislative bills, schedules and records. The documents are
essential for keeping track of legislation and other developments at
the Capitol.
   The boxes replaced an older system, in which bills were stuffed
in pigeon holes assigned to news organizations, lobbyists and other
groups. There were no locks and doors, and sometimes material was
taken.
   Since this is the first session the boxes are being used, they're
``probably a little tight'' and more difficult to open, said David
B. Ogle, executive director of the Legislative Management Committee.
``People will get used to them.''

   University of Oklahoma officials have purged
library computers of a virus that ruined several students' papers
and shut down terminals and printers in a student computer lab.
   The library also has set up extra computers at its computer lab
entrance to inspect students' programs for viruses before they are
used on other computers, said Bizzell Memorial Library manager
Donald Hudson.
   A computer virus is a program that, once inside a computer,
duplicates itself. A virus can tell computers to put a message on a
screen or shut down at a certain time or just replicate itself until
the computer overloads.
   The library's virus probably got into a computer through a
student's disk, but the student may not have known the virus was
there, Hudson said. The library's computers are not linked to any
computer off-campus.
   The computers used in the student lab are connected through
printers, which allowed the virus to spread, Hudson said.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-author Barry Sadler, who suffered
brain damage when he was shot in the head last year in Guatemala, is
missing and needs medical attention, his family says.
   Sadler's wife and children said he was discharged Sunday night
from a Veterans Administration Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, and they
don't know where he is now.
   Sadler, 48, whose ``Ballad of the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 song
in 1966 and who also has written a series of best-selling adventure
novels, was shot in the head during a robbery attempt at his home in
Guatemala City in September.
   He was brought to a VA hospital in Nashville and transferred to
the hospital in Cleveland in November.
   Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth Sadler, and her children, who live in
Hendersonville and Murfreesboro, had planned to go to Ohio and fly
Sadler back to the Nashville hospital Monday.
   But Mrs. Sadler said the hospital night shift in Cleveland
believed ``they had to release him because he had not been adjudged
legally incompetent.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Jane Kennedy-Aspis was not immediately
available for comment this morning, her office said.
   Mrs. Sadler filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to establish a
guardianship for her husband, contending he is ``unable to attend to
his business affairs, make rational decisions or control all of his
bodily functions.''
   He also has a life-threatening blood clot in his left leg and a
catheter that could cause serious infection, the lawsuit said.
   Probate Judge Jim Everett appointed Thor Sadler, 24, as his
father's temporary guardian Tuesday and set a hearing for Jan. 18 on
a permanent guardian.

<TEXT>
   A plan to revive steam train passenger service to
the Grand Canyon has won tentative approval from the National Park
Service, provided its operators can show that it will reduce
automobile traffic.
   Grand Canyon Railway announced Tuesday that it plans to establish
service over the 64 miles between Grand Canyon Village on the south
rim and Williams, a town of 2,400 people near Flagstaff.
   The line was built in 1901, but passenger service was halted in
1968.
   The company also hopes to build a hotel and Old West theme park
at Williams, said Robert Roth, Grand Canyon Railway president and
chief operating officer.
   Roth noted that others had failed in their attempts to resume the
steam train service, but said his company had obtained the necessary
permits and financing.
   ``We own all the properties involved, our investors' money is in
the bank, and this one's for real,'' he said.
   The Park Service says it supports restoration of train service
because it might help reduce automobile traffic at Grand Canyon
National Park, which had 3.9 million visitors in 1988.
   ``It's fair to say the Park Service has given them tacit approval
providing that it can be demonstrated there will be reduction in
automobile congestion,'' park spokesman Chuck Lundy said.

   The Cabinet has approved a nationwide
ban on logging, which was blamed for aggravating November floods
that killed more than 350 people, an official said Wednesday.
   Agriculture Minister Sanan Kachornprasart announced Tuesday that
$23.5 million had been allocated to create an armed force to guard
the forests.
   The floods, fed by heavy rain, caused havoc in 12 southern
provinces. In the worst-hit area, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, many people
were killed when mud, logs and trees cascaded down barren hillsides
and buried entire villlages.
   The ban would end the 301 logging concessions awarded nationwide.
It is expected to take effect when Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan and King Bhumipol Adulyadej sign it within two weeks.
   Choonhavan says Thailand's need for wood products can be met by
imports.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS new 3rd graf, ``Asked today,'' with Reagan comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Washington delivered his farewell
address to a Philadelphia newspaper, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford
delivered theirs to Congress and Ronald Reagan is turning to the
medium of which he is most the master _ television.
   Reagan's swan song as president will be delivered at 9 p.m. EST
tonight from the Oval Office and will be carried by the networks.
   Asked today for a preview of his speech, Reagan told reporters,
``I'm just trying tonight to have a conversation with the American
people.''
   The White House press office said the address, expected to last
about 20 minutes, would be the 43rd television speech of Reagan's
presidency.
   ``We expect it to be a very personal kind of look at what
President Reagan tried to do, and what he sees as his
accomplishments, and the problems ahead,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   ``It will be an opportunity for him to talk directly to the
American people as he has done so often in the last eight years.''
   Indeed he has.
   It was through this forum that the president:
   _ Helped generate the steam to push his tax cuts through Congress.
   _ Sprang his Star Wars plan for a space-based defense against
missiles.
   _ Mourned the death of the Challenger space pioneers.
   _ Defended his decisions in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Kenneth Duberstein, the White House chief of staff, said this
morning on NBC's ``Today'' program the speech is intended to be ``a
personal conversation that the president really wants to have with
the American public.''
   Duberstein predicted the address would include ``a little bit of
nostalgia, pointing to the accomplishments, pointing to some of the
vision that Ronald Reagan brought to the Oval Office and to the
presidency in 1981 and some vision that he has for continuing the
Reagan revolution.''
   ``I think you're going to hear some anecdotes and some stories
but you're going to hear Ronald Reagan talking about how
fundamentally America has been changed, the world has been
changed,'' Duberstein said.
   ``And I think you may see some advice for the American people in
the years to come that may be a little bit different than you may
have anticipated.''
   The former radio announcer, movie actor and after-dinner speaker
came to the White House with more television-related experience than
any of his predecessors. His 1964 television speech for Barry
Goldwater helped catapult Reagan into two terms as governor of
California, where he continued to sharpen his television skills as
well as gaining experience in government.
   In his first major televised speech from the Oval Office, he
outlined his tax reduction program on July 27, 1981, using charts
and a pointer to make his case that the administration plan was more
fair than that proposed by Democrats in Congress. He ended, as he
would so often, ``Thank you, God bless you, and good night.''
   But his statement from the Oval Office on Nov. 13, 1986, that the
arms sent to Iran ``could easily fit into a single cargo plane'' and
did not constitute a swap of arms for hostages, failed to go over in
Congress. Reagan later had to admit mistakes had been made.
   Sometimes he had surprises up his sleeve. His speech on March 23,
1983, announcing that he was ordering a study of what came to be
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, was news to
many of his key advisers.
   His speech on the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, was one
of his shortest, only 11 paragraphs, and is often cited as an
example of Reagan at his most eloquent. Speaking only a few hours
after the disaster, he told the families of the crew members, ``They
wished to serve, and they did,'' and added, ``Nothing ends here; our
hopes and our journeys continue.''
   Tonight's speech is likely to be short on news, but it follows a
tradition of farewell addresses that has been followed by many
previous presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter.
   Washington's farewell address attacked ``the spirit of party''
and warned against foreign entanglements. Washington released it to
one newspaper, the American Daily Advertiser, and papers throughout
the new nation quickly picked it up. It has become a classic
American text that is still read annually in Congress on
Washington's birthday.
   The most celebrated presidential address of the television era is
Dwight Eisenhower's on Jan. 17, 1961, in which the old general
warned, ``In the councils of government we must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by
the military-industrial complex.''
   Johnson and Ford, both former congressional leaders, chose to
make their final speeches in the form of State of the Union
addresses to Congress, as some other presidents have done.
   Carter spoke from the Oval Office on Jan. 14, 1981, six days
before Reagan took over. The Democrat promised Reagan his support
``to the very limits of conscience and conviction'' and warned of
the need to reduce the ``horrifying danger'' of nuclear arms
stockpiles.
   Fitzwater said Reagan spent several hours this week working on
his speech.
   If it is like most presidential speeches, he will also have had
some help from the speechwriting office. But then that's nothing
new. According to Washington biographer James Thomas Flexner, the
nation's first president worked from a draft by his secretary of the
treasury, Alexander Hamilton.

   President Reagan said today the plight of
American hostages in Lebanon has never been out of his mind since
they were seized, but he declined to speculate on whether they might

   ``I can only pray and continue what we've been (doing),'' Reagan
told reporters in response to a question. ``We've been exploring
every channel possible for their release, and they've never been out
of my mind since they were so unfairly seized.''
   The president was then asked if there might be a repeat of what
happened in 1981, when American hostages held in Iran were released
on Inauguration Day.
   ``I won't hazard any speculation on that,'' he said. ``It's just,
it's a great tragedy. We hope that it can be resolved.''

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with repeated political defeats, angry
motorists and insurance rates averaging more than $1,000 a car, Gov.
Thomas H. Kean said it may be time to abolish New Jersey's no-fault
auto insurance system.
   ``If we can't have real no-fault, it is time to admit the system
doesn't work and close it down, shoot it and put us out of our
misery,'' Kean said in his State of the State message Tuesday.
   Kean has said before it may be time to abolish the 16-year-old
system, arguing that rates will continue to rise if lawmakers do not
pass his proposal to place strict limits on lawsuits. But he has
never said it so combatively or in such a prominent forum.
   Kean spokesman John Samerjan said Wednesday that the governor
made the statement out of frustration with lawmakers and has not
been working on a formal proposal to abolish the system.
   More than 20 states have no-fault insurance, under which the
medical bills of accident victims are paid regardless of who was at
fault, said Leonard Karp, a spokesman for the state Department of
Insurance.
   For six years, the Legislature has refused to limit lawsuits to
only the most seriously injured. Lobbyists for the legal profession
contend such limits will strip victims of their right to sue in
exchange for a savings of only $100 per car.
   Auto insurance rates in New Jersey are among the highest in the
nation.
   The Joint Underwriting Association, a state-backed agency created
under the Kean administration in 1983 to cover drivers unable to
purchase coverage in the private market, is staggering under a
deficit of more than $2.5 billion.
   To keep the JUA afloat, all of the state's more than 4 million
drivers pay an average of $220 per car in annual surcharges.
   A series of reforms took effect Jan. 1 to contain rising rates by
increasing deductibles, requiring accident victims to pay part of
their medical costs and imposing a fee schedule on how much doctors
may charge.
   The reforms also allow drivers to limit their right to sue in
exchange for lower premiums, but Kean has said such an option is
inadequate.
   ``I was shocked. It's like he was looking for something dramatic
to round out his speech,'' said Michael M. Rossi III, president of
the Independent Insurance Agents of New Jersey. ``We just went
through a long, arduous task of legislative wheeling and dealing and
now we're seeing the beginning of that law. He has to give the law a
chance to work.''

   President Reagan said today that
President-elect Bush is doing the right thing in attending the
funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito despite the late emperor's role
as a leader of Japan during World War II.
   A reporter asked the president about the matter after a meeting
on an unrelated matter in the Oval Office.
   Reagan, noting the friendship that has developed between the two
countries since the war, said, ``Yes, I think he should (go)''.
   The president-elect's spokesman said Bush will lead the U.S.
delegation to Hirohito's funeral on Feb. 24, five weeks after Bush
is inaugurated as president.
   Bush will be accompanied by his wife, Barbara, spokesman Steve
Hart said Tuesday. He had no other details on the itinerary,
composition of the delegation or other travel planned by the
incoming president.
   Hirohito died Saturday of intestinal cancer at the age of 87. He
was succeeded as emperor by his son, Akihito.
   The Japan trip is the first foreign travel announced for Bush,
who will be inaugurated Jan. 20.
   The announcement confirmed that the incoming administration will
continue to stress the importance of U.S. ties with Japan, described
at the State Department earlier Tuesday as the most important U.S.
bilateral relationship in the world.
   The late Japanese monarch is now known as the Emperor Showa,
using the historical name of his reign, which covered 62 years
marking Japanese military expansion, the nation's defeat in World
War II, reconciliation, reconstruction, dramatic economic growth and
new prosperity.

   Congress wants to make one of its best perks
even better for the 1990 election year by budgeting a record $114
million for official mailings.
   The figure is included in President Reagan's proposed budget but
Congress actually draws up its own spending proposal.
   It is normal for Congress to about double its mailing costs in
election years, even though campaign materials cannot be sent with
taxpayer money.
   For fiscal 1989, Congress has budgeted $60.9 million, according
to budget documents. In the election year of 1988, however,
congressional mailings cost $113.3 million, a figure highlighted in
a report on congressional perks by consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   Nader opposes Reagan's recommendation that members of Congress
receive $135,000 in annual pay instead of the current $89,500.
   The raise will become law unless both houses of Congress defeat
the plan by Feb. 8, and House leaders are dropping hints they have
no plans to schedule a vote by then.
   In addition to having taxpayers pay for their official mail,
lawmakers receive ``orange bag'' service from the Postal Service,
ensuring one-day delivery.
   Other fringe benefits are less costly, but provide the 535
members of Congress a life without some of the hassles that face
ordinary citizens.
   Parking, for instance.
   Special tags permit lawmakers to use any curbside in the District
of Columbia except along fire hydrants, fire stations or loading
docks.
   At National and Dulles airports, members can use special lots
next to the terminals.
   Lawmakers can stay fit by using using the gym in the Rayburn
House Office Building and exercise rooms in the Russell and Dirksen
Senate office buildings. Facilities include a swimming pool,
handball, volleyball and basketball courts and a steam room.
   Should a member become ill at work, or need an immunization or
allergy shot, he or she can go to the Attending Physicians Service
in the Capitol. It is staffed with doctors, nurses and technicians,
and includes such services as a medical response team, an ambulance,
laboratory, X-ray and pharmacy services. Free medical testing is
available at the Senate Health Club.
   Members can participate in federal employee health insurance
programs, and life insurance of $78,000 is provided, with taxpayers
picking up half the cost and members paying for the other half.
   Lawmakers have approved tax deductions for many groups of
Americans, and have included a special one for themselves: a
deduction of $3,000 per year for living expenses while away from
their congressional districts or home states.
   If a lawmaker discusses legislative business with anyone who is
not a staffer or a fellow member of Congress, he can be reimbursed
for the cost of food and beverage.
   While lawmakers can't depend on job security, those who stay
awhile can live comfortably on their pensions.
   Some former members have received over $1 million in pension
benefits, and dozens of others are approaching the million-dollar
mark, according to Nader's report.
   Lawmakers can invest up to 10 percent of their base pay in a 401
(k) pension plan _ a program available to many Americans, in which
no tax is paid until money is withdrawn.
   But for members of Congress, taxpayers match the first 5 percent
of salary, a contribution that currently is worth $4,475 a year per
member. If the pay raise goes through, the taxpayer share would
total $6,750.
   Covered by Social Security and _ if they choose, the Civil
Service retirement programs _ members can receive pension benefits
at age 50 after 20 years of service or age 60 after 10 years of
service.
   Reports filed by congressional committees and other reports show
travel expenditures of $6.7 million during the 1987 calendar year,
money that comes from the State Department budget.

<HEAD>New Law Permits Demonstrations, Free Political Parties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament passed two historic laws
Wednesday giving citizens of this communist country the rights to
demonstrate and form associations, including independent political
parties.
   The action followed months of debate on bringing a multiparty
system to Hungary, where the Communist Party has been the only legal
political organization since taking power in 1948.
   On Tuesday, the government accepted a proposal from the legal
committee to present another law regulating operations of new
political parties by Aug. 1 rather than next year, as originally
intended.
   Until it is passed, two fledgling political parties and dozens of
independent political groups formed in recent months cannot enter
candidates in parliamentary or local council elections.
   Speeding action could make competitive, multiparty elections
possible in 1990, when the current parliament's five-year term
expires. A new constitution also is to be proclaimed next year.
   Voters were given a choice of candidates in the 1985
parliamentary elections, but they were carefully screened.
Three-quarters of the deputies in the current parliament are
Communist Party members.
   Only six of the 387 deputies voted against the law on
associations and 24 abstained. Seven opposed the law on assembly,
which sets rules for demonstrations and rallies, and 16 abstained.
   The associations law gives requirements for organizing and
registering independent groups, and in effect allows retroactive
legalization of those already formed.
   Some deputies urged the government in Tuesday's debate to abandon
the separate law regulating political parties, contending
associations and groups should be governed by the same standard.
   More orthodox Communist legislators said this would lead to
anarchy and parties shouild not even be formed until the law
regulating them was passed.
   After the session, Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar told reporters
the Aug. 1 date was a middle ground, ``a compromise in the interest
of the whole.''
   Until recent efforts for political reform began, Hungary's
parliament often merely validated actions of the Communist Party
leadership. State TV began live broadcasts of some sessions in
September, however, and deputies have become more outspoken.
   Gyoergy Boecsey, chairman of the legal committee, said setting a
date for the party law was ``sufficient guarantee'' of a future
multiparty system.
   The law on assembly gives guidelines for holding demonstrations
and public rallies, and declares holding them to be a fundamental
right. It provides sentences of up to three years in jail for those
attempting to interfere with that right.
   Magyar Hirlap, the governent newspaper, carried comment from some
of the new organizations.
   Zoltan Biro of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the independent
group claiming the largest membership, was quoted as saying it is
``of primary importance that self-organization take place in a legal
framework'' and urging adoption of the political party law ``as soon
as possible.''
   An unsigned statement attributed to the Alliance of Free
Democrats said the right of ``free formation of political parties
belongs to the right of association,'' indicating opposition to a
separate party law.
   An independent youth movement, the Federation of Young Democrats,
called original versions of the laws ``undemocratic and
overregulated'' and said the final versions guaranteed some ``basic
human rights.''

<HEAD>Court Says Pennsylvania Utilities May Not Recover Costs of Abandoned
Plants</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 11-14, State Consumer Advocate, with reaction.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today handed state officials
and consumers a big victory, ruling that two Pennsylvania utilities
may not recover from electricity customers the costs of four
abandoned nuclear power plants.
   The justices said states have broad power to set rates that
balance the interests of utility investors and the public. The
Constitution does not require that states allow utility companies to
recover from their customers all ``prudent'' investment, the
justices said.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices upheld a ruling that bars the
Pennsylvania companies from billing electricity customers for $50
million invested in the abandoned plants.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said,
``The Constitution within broad limits leaves the states free to
decide what rate-setting methodology best meets their needs in
balancing the interests of the utility and the public.''
   Rehnquist rejected arguments that Pennsylvania regulators
unconstitutionally confiscated the utilities' property when they
overturned a previously approved rate increase to cover the costs of
the abandoned plants.
   The court upheld a provision of Pennsylvania law that instructed
utility regulators on how to set rates.
   ``It cannot seriously be contended that the Constitution prevents
state legislatures from giving specific instructions to their
utility commissions,'' Rehnquist said.
   He said states have broad discretion over how they go about
regulating utilities, as long as the final result is a reasonable
system.
   ``An otherwise reasonable rate is not subject to constitutional
attack by questioning the theoretical consistency of the method that
produced it,'' Rehnquist said.
   Duquesne Light Co. and Pennsylvania Power Co. said their property
was confiscated without just compensation when they were barred from
passing on to customers the cost of the abandoned plants.
   State Consumer Advocate David Barasch called the action ``a
blockbuster decision.''
   He said about $50 million is involved for Pennsylvania
ratepayers, ``but the significance in the long run is enormous. The
court reaffirmed the principle that there is no constitutional right
to collect every penny on an investment if the investment is not in
the public interest.''
   Kenneth Service, a spokesman for Duquesne, said the company
already instituted a refund program after the state Supreme Court
overturned a Commonwealth Court ruling that upheld the state Public
Utility Commission.
   ``From a financial perspective, it doesn't greatly affect us
because we had already taken a loss on those cancellations,'' he
said. He estimated the loss at about $34 million.
   Duquesne and Penn Power in 1967 formed the Central Area Power
Coordination Group along with three Ohio utilities _ Ohio Edison
Co., Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. and Toledo Edison Co.
   The group planned to build and finance electric-generating
plants, and in the early 1970s construction of four nuclear plants
was authorized.
   Construction of the plants, known as the Davis-Besse Unit No. 2
and 3 and Erie Unit No. 1 and 2, was canceled in 1980 after the Arab
oil embargo and the nuclear power accident at Three Mile Island in
Pennsyvania in 1979.
   The two utilities then sought to recover pre-construction costs
associated with the plants by having their customers pay higher
rates over a 10-year period.
   The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission in 1983 granted
Duquesne permission to collect $3.46 million a year for 10 years and
said Penn Power could collect $956,000 a year over the same period.
   Those allowances were included in a $105 million rate increase
approved for Duquesne and a $15.3 million rate hike for Penn Power.
   But those rate increases were challenged successfully by the
Pennsylvania State Office of the Consumer Advocate.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the rate hikes, basing
its decision on a new state law that barred utilities from including
construction costs of generating facilities in their rate base until
the facility ``is used and useful in service to the public.''
   The case is Duquesne Light vs. Barasch, 87-1160.

   Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates, designer of the World
Financial Center office towers in Manhattan and a master plan for
Hartford, Conn., on Wednesday was named winner of the American
Institute of Architect's Architectural Firm Award for 1989.
   The award is issued annually to a firm that has consistently
produced distinguished architecture for at least 10 years. The AIA
award jury praised the firm as ``an outpost of consistent quality
finely realized.''
   The firm, which is based in New Haven, Conn., was formed in 1977
by Pelli, Diana Balmori and Fred Clarke.
   Their designs include the expansion and renovation of the Museum
of Modern Art; Northwest Center in Minneapolis; apartment buildings
on the sites of Carnegie Hall and the Museum of Modern Art; and the
proposed new Madison Square Garden. The firm also has designed
master plans for Rice University, Erieview, Ohio, and the Fan Pier
development in Boston.

   A 71-year-old woman facing eviction from
her ramshackle home in a state park ridiculed a suggestion that she
be allowed to stay, in new quarters, as an honorary park ranger.
   ``They want to make me a park ranger? I'm laughing through my
tears, really,'' said Doris Gagnon. ``They must think I have a screw
loose.''
   The Department of Environmental Protection, which is drafting
plans to develop the park, decided Tuesday to initiate eviction
proceedings after Gagnon ignored a Monday deadline for leaving the
property, officials said.
   At the same time, a letter from the eight Republicans on the
15-member Milford board of aldermen was sent to department
Commissioner Leslie Carothers proposing the compromise that would
permit Gagnon to remain.
   ``I think everyone wants the park to move forward. But I think it
would be better to go in the direction of honoring Doris _ she is
sort of folklore in this city,'' said Frederick Lisman, the
aldermen's Republican chairman.
   Wanda Rickerby, spokeswoman for the department, said Carothers
would not respond until she had received the proposal.
   Gagnon's home on Long Island Sound was one of 100 that were
demolished to make way for the park. After losing a court battle to
save her house in 1971, she established a series of ramshackle
homesteads in the vicinity of her old property. She has a small
camper and shacks with no running water.
   She said she expects to win millions of dollars in compensation
when the showdown over her eviction reaches the courts.
   The Republican aldermen proposed the state build a small house
for her in an out-of-the-way part of the park. As honorary park
ranger, she would look after things, Lisman said.
   ``To ask the taxpayers to again foot the bill is totally
irresponsible,'' said Joseph Castignoli, the Democratic leader on
the Board of Aldermen. ``No matter how small the house is, it's
going to cost the taxpayers.''
   Castignoli noted that the state, after determining the value of
Gagnon's home in 1969, provided $15,000 in compensation. After
Gagnon refused the payment, the state used it to satisfy two liens
on the property.
   Gagnon said Monday she gets water and takes showers at friends'
homes but lives at the homestead year-round.

   Communist rebels burned the
headquarters of a military battalion and four buses in a new wave of
violence this week that killed at least 21 people, military
officials said Wednesday.
   In the latest attack, which occurred before dawn Wednesday, New
People's Army guerrillas commandeered two government vehicles from
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos' hometown and then burned four
buses owned by the provincial governor's family, officials said.
   Batac police chief Florentino Dumlao Gov. Rodolfo Farinas of
Ilocos Norte province said last year he had rejected demands by the
rebels for payment of ``revolutionary taxes.''
   In one of the bloodiest attacks, about 80 rebels raided a remote
army detachment in the province of Agusan del Sur early Tuesday,
said Col. Cristobal Gurrea, an army brigade commander on Mindanao
island. He said four soldiers were killed.
   He said that shortly afterward, rebels burned two houses used as
headquarters of a nearby army battalion.
   Military reports also said six rebels were killed in other
attacks on Negros island.
   The rebels have been fighting to topple the government for 20
years.

<HEAD>Labor Panel Calls for Further Cut in Working Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Further cuts in working hours are needed to give
``workaholic'' Japanese more leisure time, a government labor panel
said Wednesday.
   The 22-member advisory panel, headed by former Bank of Japan Gov.
Haruo Maekawa, made the proposal in a report submitted to Labor
Minister Hyosuke Niwa.
   The average Japanese worked 2,150 hours in 1986, compared with
1,938 for the British, 1,924 for Americans, 1,655 for West Germans
and 1,643 for the French, said Masaaki Haga, a Labor Ministry
official.
   The Japanese average edged up to 2,168 hours in 1987, for which
figures of other industrialized countries were not available, Haga
said.
   The panel's report asked the government, business and labor to
work toward a five-day work week. Many Japanese companies still
operate at least 5{ days a week.
   The panel also urged top business managers to lead the way in
taking holidays to encourage employees to follow suit.
   Even when entitled to longer periods, few Japanese take more than
a week or two of vacation a year; many take no vacation or only a
day or two.
   The government began a campaign for fewer working hours several
years ago as a way to increase personal consumption and the growth
of service and other domestic industries. Japan's trade partners
have been urging it to rely less on exports and more on domestic
sales to spur its economic growth.
   In its first revision of the Labor Standards Law in 40 years, the
government last year set a goal of shortening the legal work week to
40 hours from 48. Although no date was set for attaining the goal,
Labor Ministry officials say the work week will be shortened to 44
hours by 1991 and to 40 by 1995.
   In a move initiated by the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
last year, the postal savings system, banks and stock exchanges have
agreed to eliminate Saturday business starting in February.
   Banks and stock exchanges close on the second and third Saturdays
of each month.

   Most of the world's nations today condemned the use
of chemical weapons and urged a speedy conclusion to negotiations in
Geneva on eliminating toxic arms from the face of the earth.
   In a compromise between the United States and Arab nations, the
final declaration did not explicitly link the control of nuclear and
chemical weapons but referred to a 1978 United Nations document that
does so.
   U.S. delegates said they were pleased with the declaration, which
officials from 150 nations adopted by consensus after a five-day
meeting.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
administration was pleased with the outcome of the conference.
   ``The U.S. objectives for the conference were to focus worldwide
attention on the problems of chemical weapons use and chemical
weapons proliferation and help put a stop to the use of these
weapons in violation of international law,'' he said.
   The document reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the
use of chemical weapons and called for stepped-up negotitions in
Geneva to ban the development, production and storage of chemical
arms. It also urged giving the U.N. secretary-general more power to
investigate chemical weapons use.
   The participating states ``solemnly affirm their commitments not
to use chemical weapons and condemn such use. They recall their
serous concern at recent violations as established and condemned by
the competent organs of the United Nations,'' the declaration said.
   ``The participating states stress the necessity of concluding, at
an early date, a convention on the prohibition of the development,
production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons, and on
their destruction. This convention shall be global and comprehensive
and effectively verifiable.''
   Arriving at a consensus required days of haggling and compromise.
U.S. officials said that they got more than they expected.
   ``We're very pleased with a very substantive declaration that
hits all the main points that the conference should have
addressed,'' said Gary Crocker, a member of the U.S. delegation.
``The important thing is that we have the world's attention focused
on this serious problem.''
   The declaration, which is not binding, illustrates ``the common
will of nations to condemn chemical weapons,'' Kalevi Sorsa of
Finland, chairman of the drafting committee, told reporters after
the meeting ended.
   Sorsa said obtaining a consensus ``required concessions and
compromises from all sides.'' But, ``From here on we can refer back
to the Paris conference and its text.''
   The resolution reaffirms participating nations' commitment to a
Geneva protocol that bans the use of chemical weapons but not their
production and storage. The protocol often has been ignored since it
was signed 67 years ago.
   Arab delegates failed to persuade the meeting to implicitly
condemn Israel's alleged nuclear capability. Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz of Iraq said he and his Arab colleagues finally decided not to
take a position that would prevent the success of the conference.
   Work on the declaration continued through Tuesday night to
reconcile deep-seated differences between industrialized nations and
Arab states. Including the word ``nuclear'' became the main obstacle
to consensus.
   Arab states wishing to retain the right to have chemical weapons
to offset Israel's alleged nuclear force, had asked that chemical
disarmament be linked directly to nuclear disarmament, a position
opposed by the United States and the Soviet Union.
   In the end, the declaration excluded the word ``nuclear,'' but
referred to the final declaration of the 1978 U.N. General Assembly
session devoted to disarmament that linked nuclear and chemical
negotiations.
   Aziz complained, ``That draft falls short of our concerns ...
Where there is one country that has nuclear weapons and that country
that has mass destruction weapons is not a signatory to the
non-proliferation treaty ... and has refused to reach peace ... that
nation constitutes a real threat to the peace and security of the
region.''
   Both the superpowers have thousands of tons of chemical weapons
in storage, and the United States has a program to develop new
sophisticated systems.
   Another 20 nations, including many at the conference, possess the
weapons or are in the process of developing them.

   Jurors whose lives have been on hold for
nearly two years in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial had
some explaining to do about ominous-looking notes scrawled on a jury
room chalk board.
   ``HUNGJURY,'' ``HANGMAN,'' ``VERDICT,'' ``WASTED,'' ``$10 A DAY''
and ``2{ YRS'' were written in columns, suggesting jurors had been
discussing the case despite an order not to do so by Superior Court
Judge William Pounders.
   But jurors said it was all a joke. Questioned individually
Tuesday, two jurors admitted the chalk board notes involved
suggestions for personalized license plates on a juror's new car.
   Pounders said he was convinced it was in jest and only reflected
their frustration given the duration of the case.
   Trial for Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, 62, began in April 1987. Pounders told jurors Tuesday the
proceedings should conclude by April.

   Hispanics, while growing by 34 percent to 20 million in this
decade, still lack an effective voice in society, according to
population researchers Cary Davis and Rafael Valdivieso.
   Policy makers need to find ways to ease the transition of Latinos
into American society, including bringing them into the economic and
political process, Valdivieso, vice president of the
Washington-based Hispanic Policy Development Project, said at a news
conference.
   In the past, new arrivals in America have had available the
springboard of low-skill jobs to help them get started in society,
commented Davis, of the private Population Reference Bureau.
   But U.S. society is moving away from industrial and other jobs
that often need little training, with available employment often
requiring higher education and skill levels, Davis said.
   Thus, he explained, the ``ladder'' of jobs climbed by past
minority groups to make a place in society is being pulled from the
grasp of Hispanics.
   ``National attention, we think, is required,'' said Davis in
releasing a study written by the two men. Entitled ``U.S. Hispanics:
Challenging Issues for the 1990s,'' it is published by the
Population Reference Bureau, an independent research group.
   Hispanics will become the nation's largest minority sometime in
the next century, outnumbering blacks, if current population trends
continue, explained Valdivieso.
   And the fact that Hispanics have a younger age structure than the
rest of society means more of their numbers will be in the work
force at a time when large numbers of other Americans are retiring.
   Valdivieso said programs are needed to help keep Hispanics in
school and to provide them with job training and assistance in
making the transition from school to the job market.
   Raising the minimum wage would be important, especially for young
couples who are parents, said Valdivieso. And, for the same group,
finding ways to provide medical assistance is a major consideration,
he said.
   He called for more English-language classes for immigrants, while
preserving bilingual public services; more access to welfare
programs; efforts to reduce discrimination against Hispanics;
programs to help Hispanics become more active politically and
increased corporate attention to Latinos as consumers and employees.

<HEAD>Another Transplant Needed by Girl Who Received Heart of Friend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PATTERSON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new heart is needed by a 17-year-old
girl whose body is rejecting the heart of a friend that was
transplanted into her after his unexpected death three years ago.
   Donna Ashlock has been treated for 10 episodes of organ rejection
since she received the heart of her classmate, Felipe Garza Jr., her
father said, so her doctors are seeking a new donor for another
transplant.
   ``They had a new heart they were going to give her last Thursday
night, but it didn't match,'' Ray Ashlock said Tuesday at their home
in the Central California farming town of Patterson.
   Donna's case became famous because of the circumstances
surrounding the heart that has been beating in her body since
January 1986.
   Felipe, a 15-year-old who had a crush on Donna, knew she had a
degenerative heart disease and wouldn't live much longer without a
transplant.
   Although he had not been ill, Felipe told his parents, farm
workers, he wanted his heart donated to her after his death. A short
time later on Jan. 4, 1986, he died unexpectedly when a blood vessel
burst in his brain.
   As Felipe wished, his friend, then 14, received his heart in an
operation at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco.
Patterson's City Council named a park in the boy's honor. The family
has since moved away from the community.
   Donna has had to return to the hospital 75 miles northwest of her
home often since the operation for organ rejection treatment and
check-ups.
   Hospital spokeswoman Nancy Millhouse said it is fairly common for
a body to reject a transplanted organ. ``In 5 to 10 percent of the
cases, there is chronic rejection. She's been through a lot and
she's handled herself well.''
   Ashlock said his medical insurance as a city employee didn't
cover all the $500,000 cost of Donna's initial operation, and bills
for treatment and transportation have mounted since, leaving him
wondering if he can ever pay off all of daughter's medical bills.
   ``We've got some bills that are $35,000 a whack,'' Ashlock said.
   Donna, who turns 18 on April 1, is anxiously awaiting another
heart.
   ``I think I'll be better off with a new one,'' said the
teen-ager, who studies at home since her condition keeps her from
attending regular classes at Patterson High School. She will
graduate this spring if she can stay well enough to maintain her
grades.
   She hopes to go to college and become a nurse, not because she's
had so many nurses care for her, but because ``I like helping people
and stuff.''

<TEXT>
   About 150 Central Americans camped
outside the immigration office early today hoping to get the
documents they need to get out of southern Texas before the
government has another chance to keep them here.
   Hundreds of others were staying at shelters provided by churches,
including some the Red Cross has begun overseeing.
   ``We're here to keep a good place in line,'' said Jorge Narvaez
Romero, a 34-year-old Nicaraguan trying to get to Los Angeles, where
he has a cousin. ``Everybody's leaving the (Rio Grande) Valley.''
   The exodus began Monday when U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela
issued a temporary restraining order blocking an Immigration and
Naturalization Service rule that went into effect last month. The
rule prevented immigrants seeking political asylum from traveling
farther into the United States while their cases are being decided.
   Vela's order was to last until Thursday, pending a full hearing
on a class-action lawsuit against the INS, but was extended when the
hearing was postponed to Jan. 31. Those camping outside the office
said they wanted to make certain the INS attended to them before the
hearing.
   ``I'm trying to leave tomorrow,'' said Jairo Ramon Contreras
Martinez, a 24-year-old Nicaraguan camped by the door and trying to
make it to a cousin's house in Austin. ``Thank God for the kindness
of the American people.''
   Dolores Muniz and other members of Harlingen's Citizens'
Committee for Justice took blankets, sweet potatoes, beans, rice,
noodles, bread and tea to the men, women and children huddled under
blankets and sheets of black plastic at the INS center Tuesday.
   ``We're all human beings,'' Mrs. Muniz said. ``These people are
freezing, they're starving.''
   Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the INS' Harlingen District, said
more than 800 people were in line when the door opened Tuesday.
   ``It was reminiscent of the last days of the amnesty program''
last year when some undocumented aliens received legal status under
a landmark immigration-reform law, Ms. Kice said.
   Greyhound Lines saw its normal northbound passenger loads triple
by Tuesday on the morning and afternoon buses from Brownsville and
Harlingen, a company spokesman said.
   ``Most of the people, about 75 percent, are going to Miami,''
said George Gravley, Greyhound spokesman in Dallas.
   Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, said that if the right to travel
continues, the area still will need aid from the federal government
to care for the thousands of Central Americans who ``will keep
coming through the pipeline.''
   The judge's temporary order restored the previous INS procedure
allowing asylum seekers to travel from their point of entry to their
U.S. destinations to pursue their claims for refugee status. Under
those regulations, immigrants in the lower Rio Grande was supposed
to voluntarily check in with the agency in Harlingen.
   Ortiz joined a special Justice Department team that arrived
Tuesday to determine the immigrants' needs.
   ``What makes it a crisis is this is a very poor county and this
county doesn't have the money or the infrastructure to provide the
services, '' Ortiz said.
   Near Brownsville on Tuesday, crews used bulldozers to remove
debris from a makeshift campsite where more than 300 Central
Americans began staying in improvised tents after the INS procedure
took effect Dec. 16.
   The immigrants were ordered off the property by Tuesday afternoon
and many took refuge in churches.
   City commissioners voted Tuesday night to demolish the condemned
Amber Motel, where about 150 Central Americans have been holed up in
squalid conditions.

<HEAD>Vietnam: More U.S. Remains To Be Returned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE ESPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam will give more remains of Americans
missing in action to a U.S. team arriving Thursday, and joint
excavations of crash sites will be conducted, a government official
said.
   ``I think there will be quite a number,'' said Nguyen Can, acting
director of the Vietnam office for MIAs, referring to the remains.
``I don't want to make it known yet because they have to be
carefully identified.''
   Can said in an interview with The Associated Press that Vietnam
had been trying its best to speed up the return of American remains
from the Vietnam War.
   He said it is allowing U.S. teams to roam the country,
interviewing witnesses and officials in regions where the planes are
believed to have gone down. The latest team will be in Vietnam for
about 10 days, he said.
   Can denied again that there are any living American prisoners
being held in Vietnam and that Hanoi was withholding MIA remains and
handing them over to the United States when it suited its political
purposes.
   ``Even the U.S. State Department and Pentagon offcials do not
believe that there are any American prisoners in Vietnam,'' Can
said. ``This they know for sure, but because of the pressure from
the Rambo faction and the right wing in the United States they just
say it cannot be asserted that there are or there are not living
American prisoners in Vietnam.''
   Can said it would make no sense for Vietnam to hold American
prisoners or remains.
   ``What good is it for us to keep one or two American prisoners?''
he said. ``What good is it for us to hold remains if we returned to
the United States nearly 600 POWs? Why should we keep the remains?
Living prisoners of war are much more valuable if we choose to use
them as leverage.''
   Vietnam wants badly to establish diplomatic relations with the
United States. That would open the way for help for its faltering
economy with financial aid and the lifting of an American trade
embargo.
   The United States has said Vietnam first must withdraw all of its
troops from Cambodia, which Hanoi has promised to do no later than
1990.
   The United States insists the question of MIAs is a separate
humanitarian issue, but has told Vietnam that its cooperation in
returning American remains would be looked upon favorably.
   On Dec. 15, Vietnam turned over 38 sets of remains believed to be
those of American servicemen. It was the largest such repatriation
since the Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975.
   Since the end of the war, Vietnam has returned the remains of 172
Americans identified by the Army.
   There are still 2,383 Americans listed as missing in action,
including 1,747 in Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in
China.
   It is unlikely that the United States and Vietnam will be able to
account for all of the MIAs due to the lapse in time and the jungle
terrain where many of the airmen were lost.
   Can said part of the U.S. team arriving Thursday would operate in
what was once the demilitarized zone that divided North and South
Vietnam during the war.
   A joint team probably would excavate a crash site near the
Chinese border, he said.
   This will be the fourth joint effort to account for MIAs since
the joint searches were begun in October. Each operation runs about
10 days.

   President Reagan presented congressional gold
medals to Soviet human rights activists Natan and Avital Sharansky
Wednesday, saying they were given on ``behalf of all mankind, not
just all Americans.''
   Sharansky, receiving the awards for himself and his absent wife
at a ceremony in the Oval Office, praised Reagan's efforts on behalf
of human rights and urged President-elect Bush, standing beside
Reagan, to continue them.
   The awards to the Sharanskys were authorized by a law passed by
Congress on May 13, 1986, for their work for human rights and
freedom of Soviet Jewry.
   ``This is in behalf of all mankind, not just all Americans,
because of what you have done and your courage over the years,''
Reagan said. ``Nine years of imprisonment on false charges and still
retained your poise and your strength to do this.''
   Sharansky told Reagan that ``thousands and thousands of people in
Soviet camps ... are free today not because of some goodwill of
Soviet leaders but because of their struggle and your struggle.''
   ``And you, president-elect, please think about those thousands
and thousands who are still there and who are praying now for you
and that you will be as stubborn, as strong, for defending human
rights in the Soviet Union,'' he told Bush.
   ``All of your record ... convinces us that you will continue the
fantastically good record on human rights that President Reagan ...
had,'' he said.
   While talking to reporters in a White House driveway, Sharansky
said that while he believes an international human rights conference
in Moscow in 1991 ``can be positive,'' he is concerned that it
``could become the biggest public relations event in the history of
Soviet human rights.''

<HEAD>States May Shield Consumers From Paying Reactor Shut-Down Costs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   States have sweeping powers to protect
consumers by barring utilities from passing on the costs of
abandoned nuclear power plants, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
   The justices, voting 8-1, barred two Pennsylvania utilities from
billing electricity customers for nearly $50 million invested in
four abandoned plants.
   The court said the Constitution does not require states to allow
utilities to recover from customers all ``prudent'' investments. As
long as utility investors get a reasonable rate of return on their
investment, their right not to have their property confiscated is
not violated, the court said.
   In other action, the court:
   _Examined whether the death penalty is a valid punishment for
mentally retarded murderers. The justices heard arguments in the
case of a 32-year-old Texas death row inmate with the mind of a 7
year old.
   _Lengthened the time union members have to sue their unions over
alleged free-speech violations, reviving a North Carolina man's
lawsuit against his union.
   In the utility case, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for
the court, ``The Constitution within broad limits leaves the states
free to decide what rate-setting methodology best meets their needs
in balancing the interests of the utility and the public.''
   The court upheld a provision of Pennsylvania law that told
utility regulators how to set rates.
   ``It cannot seriously be contended that the Constitution prevents
state legislatures from giving specific instructions to their
utility commissions,'' Rehnquist said.
   The ruling was hailed by organizations representing state and
local officials.
   ``We are delighted. It's a terrific opinion,'' said Benna Ruth
Solomon, chief counsel to the State and Local Legal Center here. The
organization represents the National Governors' Association, the
U.S. Conference of Mayors and other groups.
   Charles D. Gray, a lawyer with the National Association of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners, said the ruling could apply to
other utility rates as well, such as those for gas and telephone
service.
   Pennsylvania Consumer Advocate David Barasch said the ruling
means ``the ratepayer is not the deep pocket of last resort. The
ratepayer is not some sort of guarantor of every penny the industry
decides to charge.''
   Nuclear industry representatives said they were not sure how much
money might be at stake nationwide. The Edison Electric Institute
said settlements between state public utility officials and plant
managers have been reached in the case of many abandoned plants.
   Rehnquist said states have broad discretion over how they go
about regulating utilities as long as the final result is a
reasonable system.
   ``An otherwise reasonable rate is not subject to constitutional
attack by questioning the theoretical consistency of the method that
produced it,'' Rehnquist said.
   The court ruled against Duquesne Light Co. and Pennsylvania Power
Co. In 1967 they formed the Central Area Power Coordination Group
with three Ohio utilities _ Ohio Edison Co., Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Co. and Toledo Edison Co.
   The group in the early 1970s made plans to build four plants,
known as the Davis-Besse Unit No. 2 and 3 and Erie Unit No. 1 and 2.
But the work was abandoned in 1980 after the Arab oil embargo and
the nuclear power accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
   The two Pennsylvania utilities then sought to recover
pre-construction costs through higher rates to customers over a
10-year period. They said plans for the facilities had been prudent,
since they were based on an expected demand that failed to
materialize for unforeseen reasons.
   The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission in 1983 granted
Duquesne permission to collect $3.46 million a year and Penn Power
$956,000 a year for 10 years. The charges were included in a $105
million rate increase for Duquesne and a $15.3 million hike for Penn
Power.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the part of the
increases aimed at covering the costs of the abandoned plants. The
increases had been challenged by the state's consumer advocate.
   The state court upheld a Pennsylvania law barring utilities from
including construction costs of generating facilities in their rate
base until the facility ``is used and useful in service to the
public.''
   Rehnquist said Wednesday that Duquesne and Penn Power had still
realized solid earnings, 11.6 per cent and 12 percent respectively.
   ``Given these numbers, ... the overall impact of the rate orders
is not constitutionally objectionable,'' Rehnquist said. ``No
argument has been made that these slightly reduced rates jeopardized
the financial integrity of the companies.''
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented on narrow grounds. He said
the court should not have ruled in the case for procedural reasons.

   Striking oil workers closed refinery
operations across Mexico today to protest the arrest of their union
boss following a gunbattle in which a federal agent was slain.
   Joaquin Hernandez Galicia's arrest on gunrunning charges Tuesday
was widely seen as a challenge to the powerful union which is
accused of corruption by the new administration of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo denied it was an
attack on the union, saying: ``It is the prosecution of crime
committed by individuals.''
   Notimex state news agency said soldiers blew down the union
boss's door with a bazooka rocket when they raided his home Tuesday
in northeastern Ciudad Madero city. Alvarez told a news conference a
federal agent was killed in the ensuing shootout with Hernandez's
bodyguards.
   Police confiscated 200 Uzi machine guns and 250,000 rounds of
ammunition at the house, Alvarez said.
   His spokesman, Carlos Torres, announced 34 people have been
arrested, including union Secretary-General Salvador Barragon
Camacho and his predecessor, Jose Sosa. Sosa and 16 others were held
on illegal weapons charges. Earlier, Torres' office incorrectly
reported 35 people were arrested.
   Union members, whose wages and benefits are among the highest in
Mexico, today paralyzed operations at six of the nation's nine oil
refineries. Strikes also shut down eight petrochemical facilities,
Excelsior news agency reported.
   Long lines formed at gasoline stations in the capital, despite
Pemex assurances of adequate supplies. Some stations closed early
Tuesday and remained closed today. Traffic was lighter than usual
during the morning rush hour as many people left their cars home
because they did not have enough gasoline or wanted to save what
they had.
   The Petroleum Workers Union of the Mexican Republic controls more
than half the lucrative drilling contracts issued by the government
oil monopoly Pemex, or Petroleos Mexicanos, S.A.
   Authorities charge the union resells contracts or collects hefty
commissions from drilling companies which pass the charge on to
Pemex.
   ``We had to move to clean up things,'' a presidential source said
on condition of anonymity. ``They knew this was coming.''
   Hernandez Galicia last week warned the union would paralyze
Mexico's oil industry if the government carried out threats to sell
Pemex operations to private investors.
   Oil revenues are crucial to the struggling Mexican economy and
Salinas, who took office Dec. 1, has vowed to sell or close
unprofitable state industries.
   Animosity between Hernandez Galicia and Salinas surfaced in
October when the union revived charges that a leading governing
party official, Mexico state Gov. Mario Ramon Beteta, embezzled
millions of dollars while serving as head of Pemex. During Beteta's
tenure, the union lost control of millions of dollars worth of
contracts.
   In Mexico City, 6,000 oil workers and their supporters quit work
when they heard of the arrests and marched to Zocalo Plaza shouting
``Freedom for Joaquin!''
   Busloads of workers from refineries in Tula and other cities
arrived all afternoon carrying workers demanding freedom for ``La
Quina,'' the diminutive by which Hernandez Galicia is known.
   All 8,000 workers struck at the Pemex refinery in the Pacific
port of Salina Cruz, said Lorenzo Jaime, editor at the newspaper El
Imparcial de Oaxaca. Notimex reported partial shutdowns hit
refineries in Salamanca, Poza Rica, Cadereyta and Minatitlan.
   Late Tuesday, Pemex claimed refinery operations were returning to
normal. ``Today's incidents ... involve individuals and do not
constitute any worker-employer conflict or attacks on the oil
guild,'' it said in a statement.
   In Ciudad Madero, traffic returned to normal after a blockade was
lifted this morning by thousands of oil workers and sympathetic
students who had cut highways leading into the twin cities of
Tampico and Ciudad Madero.
   Troops occupied the Tampico airport and a refinery in Ciudad
Madero, according to Tampico newspaper editor Agustin Jimenez.
Stores _ many operated by the union _ were shut in Ciudad Madero,
while gasoline supplies ran out in Tampico, he said.
   Soldiers also occupied Pemex installations in the northern border
city of Reynosa and in Villahermosa, capital of oil-rich Tabasco
state.
   Pemex accounts for 40 percent of Mexico's revenue and about half
the federal budget. It employs 180,000 people, mostly union members.

   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower was
dismissed from a hospital Wednesday, a week after entering for
removal of a colon polyp.
   ``His physician said he had exemplary recovery,'' said Stephen
Habgood, a spokesman for Baylor University Medical Center, where
Tower underwent surgery Thursday.
   The polyp was discovered during a colonscopy examination Dec. 27
and removed during a three-hour operation by R.J. Dignan. A biopsy
of the growth revealed it to be benign, doctors said.
   A small polyp removed from Tower's rectal area in November
contained both benign and malignant cells, Habgood said.
   Tower, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was selected Dec.
16 by President-elect Bush as his Defense secretary.

   Some Chicagoans may wonder why, but Milwaukee tourism officials
were ready for that. They hired sports commentator Al McGuire, whom
they tout as a ``noted travel authority'' to describe the charms of
``my hometown, Milwaukee.''
   It's all part of a joint effort by the Wisconsin Council on
Tourism and the Greater Milwaukee Convention and Visitors Bureau to
bring tourists flocking from Chicago, 90 miles to the south.
   Newspaper and radio advertisements due to start Sunday and run
through March in the Chicago area include broadcast commercials in
which McGuire calls on Chicagoans to experience the performing arts,
night life, restaurants and other activities in Milwaukee.
   ``So come on, you toddlin' town,'' he says in one ad. ``Toddle on
up to Milwaukee for the weekend.''
   The campaign is being financed with $100,000 from the state
council and another $100,000 solicited by the bureau from businesses
and hotels.

   A bronze statue of a wild boar at Kansas
City International Airport has been fed dimes, quarters and an
occasional dollar bill from passers-by. But recently it reaped a
real windfall.
   A Minneapolis couple made out checks for $500 and $250 and
slipped them into a slot at the base of the boar. ``I think it's a
worthy cause,'' said Clarence J. Haugh.
   Haugh wasn't referring to the boar. Contributions given to the
beast _ and to another boar at Kansas City's Country Club Plaza _
are turned over to Children's Mercy Hospital.
   Miller Nichols, former chairman of the company that developed the
Country Club Plaza, said he noticed one of the boar statues in a
store window while strolling along a riverbank in Florence, Italy,
in the late 1940s.
   ``You know,'' he said he remarked to his daughter, ``that's a
marvelous piece of sculpture, but I don't know how I would use it.''
   He said the owner told them that the original wild boar statue
was in the Straw Market of Florence and that gifts made to the
casting went to a children's orphanage. And so an idea was born.
   Nichols said he bought the statue for $2,500 and placed it at the
Country Club Plaza. Years later he returned to Florence and bought a
second statue, this one for $7,500, to put at the airport.
   The two statues produce about $7,000 annually for the hospital.
Half the money is given directly to the hospital and half goes into
an endowment fund, which totals more than $36,000.

<HEAD>Bentsen Anticipates No Changes In New Tax On Older Americans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blaming wealthy retirees for most of the
complaints, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said
Wednesday he anticipates no changes in a new tax on older Americans
that pays for protection against costs of catastrophic illness.
   ``There's a vocal minority sounding off'' about the tax, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told reporters, adding that the outcry will
subside once details of the program, which took effect Jan. 1, are
better known.
   Mail and phone calls are coming chiefly from ``wealthy people who
want it (cost of the catastrophic protection) to be more heavily
subsidized by taxpayers'' in general, he said.
   Will the clamor lead to repeal or modification of the tax?
Bentsen was asked. ``I don't think that's going to happen,'' he
said, recalling that similar complaints were heard when Social
Security and Medicare were enacted.
   Although dozens of members of Congress have signed bills to
repeal or change the tax, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, has taken a stand similar to
Bentsen's.
   Although having Congress' two top tax-writers in support of a
program is good insurance, it was not enough to save another hotly
debated tax law in 1983. Lawmakers eventually bowed to a massive
mail campaign promoted by the banking industry and repealed a
year-old law that withheld taxes from some interest and dividend
payments.
   Congress is hearing few complaints about the basic
catastrophic-protection program, which helps elderly and disabled
Americans who are eligible for Medicare bear the cost of illnesses
that otherwise would threaten their financial stability. The
complaints are directed at the method of financing the program.
   The lion's share of the cost is paid by a surtax that falls on
all those eligible for Medicare whose incomes are high enough that
they pay at least $150 a year in federal income taxes. The surtax is
15 percent of the income tax in 1989; next year it rises to 25
percent, and each year after it could climb by as much as one
percentage point a year.
   Congressional aides estimate about 40 percent of people past the
age of 65 will pay the surtax on their 1989 income.
   The maximum surtax on any person is $800 this year, or $1,600 for
a couple if both spouses are eligible; by 1993 it will rise to
$1,050 and $2,100. Congress estimates the average surtax will be
$285 per person in 1989 and $506 in 1993.
   A couple would have to make more than $70,000 to pay the maximum
$800 premium this year, Bentsen said.
   In addition to the surtax, retirees and the disabled who buy
Medicare to pay for physicians' fees are paying a higher Part B
premium because of catastrophic coverage. The monthly premium is
$31.10 this year and is expected to rise to $42.60 a month by 1993.
   Some retirees are upset that they are forced to buy catastrophic
coverage whether are not they want it, and claim they could do
better by buying private insurance.
   Bentsen said that for most retirees, that is not so. ``It's the
best buy in town,'' he said of catastrophic coverage. ``There's
nothing in the private sector that offers what it offers at those
prices.''
   Although only about 7 percent of retirees are expected to collect
on the catastrophic coverage, ``that's far more than the chanc of a
home burning,'' Bentsen said. Yet, people routinely buy fire
insurance policies, he noted, and predicted having the catastrophic
policy will ``give people the peace of mind that they are not going
to be wiped out financially.''
   He said the Finance Committee probably will have hearings on the
subject but more as a way of publicizing details of the program than
of deciding how to change the tax.

<HEAD>Teacher Fired For Dress Code Violation Gets Tuition Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POINT PLEASANT, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school mathematics teacher
fired Dec. 19 for refusing to wear a tie and dress pants to class
received a $4,647 bill from the school system today for his son and
daughter's tuition.
   Bill Webb called the move ``one of lowest forms of harassment
I've ever heard of,'' but Superintendent Charles Chambers said that
Webb was not being singled out and that parents of all out-of-state
students were billed.
   Webb, who lives in Gallipolis, Ohio, said that because he taught
at Point Pleasant High School in West Virginia, tuition for his
children had been waived.
   On Monday, the Mason County Board of Education voted to bill
out-of-state students who attended local schools in the past two
years. Webb was charged for his daughter Jarrod, a senior, and son
Shannon, who graduated in 1987.
   Webb, whose firing for insubordination for not following the
school's faculty dress code was upheld last week by the state
education workers' grievance board, said he will pay the bill and
then fight it.
   Chambers, who became superintendent last summer, said state law
requires him to charge tuition for out-of-state students. He said
previous superintendents may have waived tuitions but had no right
to do so.
   The action applies to a handful of children in addition to Webb's.
   Webb had been suspended three times for defying the school's
dress code, which was instituted in August. He said that he does not
like wearing a tie and that his casual clothes make it easier to
communicate with students.

   Roger Moore, the one-time 007 of the James Bond
films, has landed the starring role in the new Andrew Lloyd Webber
musical, ``Aspects of Love,'' the show's publicists said Wednesday.
   The 61-year-old actor, who lives in Switzerland, will lend his
untested baritone singing voice to a character similar to the
dashing secret agent he played on film. The new character is a suave
jet-setter named Sir George Dillingham who drives a Rolls-Royce and
has mistresses in France and Italy.
   The show, Lloyd Webber's first since ``The Phantom of the
Opera,'' is based on a 1955 novel by David Garnett and will be
directed by Trevor Nunn, who staged Lloyd Webber's long-running
``Cats'' and ``Starlight Express.'' It opens April 12.

   It took Tommy Durden just 22 minutes to
write Elvis Presley's No. 1 hit ``Heartbreak Hotel.'' But after a
lifetime of trying, he hasn't been able to come up with another hit.
   Durden, 69, a retired commercial dishwasher repairman, still
lives off royalties from the 1956 hit. ``Evidently, it is a better
song than I thought it was when I wrote it,'' he said.
   Durden co-wrote the song with a friend, Mae Boren Axton, while he
was playing guitar with Smiling Jack Jerring and His Swing Billies
in Gainesville, Fla.
   He said he got the idea from a newspaper story about a man who
committed suicide while clutching a note that read, ``I walk a
lonely street.'' Ms. Axton came up with the idea of having Lonely
Street lead to Heartbreak Hotel.
   Durden splits royalties three ways with Ms. Axton and Presley's
estate.
   ``I have given it a lot of thought,'' he said. ``I have come to
the conclusion that the good Lord only allows one `Heartbreak Hotel'
to the customer.''

   Actress Cybill Shepherd says neither she nor
co-star Bruce Willis are responsible for reports of feuding, cost
overruns and ratings declines on ABC-TV's ``Moonlighting.''
   ``It's scapegoat time,'' the actress said in the Jan. 14 issue of
TV Guide magazine.
   She conceded there were ``problems'' when she was pregnant and
later nursing twin infants. But she declined to discuss reports that
the show's executive producer, Glenn Gordon Caron, was angry about
her missing work. Caron similarly declined to comment.
   ``Maybe he was not thrilled that she was pregnant,'' said Allyce
Beasley, who plays receptionist Agnes Dipesto on the show. ``But you

   Miss Beasley also defended Miss Shepherd, however, saying,
``She's an actress. She does care about her work.''
   Despite much talk of a feud between the co-stars, Miss Shepherd
said she and Willis always got along on and off the set, ``and now
much better than before.''

<HEAD>Charges Withdrawn Against Marine In Death Of Corporal After Training
Exercise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Charges were withdrawn at least
temporarily today against a sergeant accused of dereliction of duty
in the death of a fellow Marine who died in the California desert
after being left behind on a training exercise.
   A lawyer for Sgt. Christopher Clyde, 28, of Mentor, Ohio, argued
for dismissal of the charges on conflict-of-interest grounds.
   The lawyer, Capt. William Fisher, contended that the battalion
commander who convened the court-martial against Clyde is himself
under scrutiny in the death of Lance Cpl. Jason J. Rother, 19, of
Minneapolis, Minn.
   Presiding judge Maj. Kent Smith approved the withdrawal of
charges, which were referred to another officer and could be refiled.
   Rother's remains were found in the Mojave Desert near Twentynine
Palms, Calif., on Dec. 4. He was serving as a road guide during a
nighttime exercise Aug. 30. He was not reported missing until more
than a day later.
   Clyde, whose court-martial began Tuesday, was charged with
disobeying an order and dereliction of duty in granting leave to
Rother's squad leader the day the exercise ended.
   The squad leader's absence contributed to the delay in searching
for Rother, officials charged.
   On Tuesday, the Marine Corps announced it will reassign the two
top officers of Rother's battalion _ Lt. Col. Edward Robeson, the
battalion commander, and Maj. T.L. Holm, the battalion's executive
officer _ within the unit.
   Maj. Stuart Wagner, the chief spokesman for base, said no
disciplinary action has been taken against Robeson and Holm.

<HEAD>EPA Lets Cotton Farmers Use Remaining Stocks Of Pesticide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Wednesday it will permit cotton farmers to use remaining stocks of
the pesticide chlordimeform this year but will not allow them to buy
more after Feb. 19.
   The agency last year announced its intention to cancel licenses
to sell chlordimeform, which it said has been shown to cause tumors
in laboratory animals.
   In recent years about 1 million pounds a year went to control the
eggs and larvae of the cotton bollworm and tobacco budworm on about
12 percent of the nation's cotton crop.
   The two manufacturers, Ciba-Geigy Corp. of Greensboro, N.C. and
Nor-Am Chemical Co. of Wilmington, Del., had requested cancellation
of the licenses and said they would recall inventories from sellers.
Those requests were made after EPA announced its intention to
conduct a special study of chlordimeform.
   EPA said it is requiring those recalls to be made, is canceling
the licenses as of Feb. 19 and is not permitting any use by farmers
after Oct. 1.
   Chlordimeform has been sold as Galecron by Ciba-Geigy and as
Fundal by Nor-Am.
   EPA said it assumed that inventories would be used up during the
1988 growing season, but ``drought and fewer pest problems'' reduced
use considerably and resulted in leftover stocks of 100,000 to
250,000 pounds on farms.
   The agency said its studies showed the long-term risk of use
would outweigh the benefits, but use ``for one additional season
would offer some specific benefits to cotton growers'' such as
improved yields at negligible risk.

   The shoeshine boy waited like a hawk, his
eyes fixed on a large family eating lunch on paper plates in a park.
   Jagdish Rajkumar, a scrawny teen-ager, was not interested in the
food.
   The moment the family finished the food and threw away the paper
plates, Rajkumar darted over and tucked the plates into a bag and
resumed his business, calling out ``Get your shoes polished for two
rupees (13 cents).''
   Rajkumar is one the millions of poor people across northern India
who are collecting rags, scraps of paper, bits of straw and anything
else that burns in an effort to keep warm during an unusually cold
Indian winter.
   Especially prized is cow dung, which makes excellent fuel when
dried and patted into cakes.
   In the last four days, 24 people in northern India have died
because of the cold, according to official reports. Newspapers put
the death toll at 100.
   This winter is mild by international standards but exceptionally
chilly in a region better known for its torrid summer heat.
   ``It is cold if you take into consideration a lesser-discussed
meteorological phenomenon,'' said G.S. Mondal of the New Delhi's
Weather Office. He explaned that Wednesday's temperature of 42
degrees Fahrenheit, combined with a 19 mph wind, made it feel like
it was just above freezing, and that has ``a tremendous biological
impact on us.''
   New Delhi's normal winter temperatures range from 46 to 50, but
even a few degrees make a big difference to people with little or no
shelter.
   ``In between my business I collect as much paper as I can to keep
us warm at night,'' said Rajkumar, who earns about $1 a day. He said
he gives about 33 cents to police so they'll look the other way when
he scavenges for paper in the park at Connaught Place, New Delhi's
central shopping district.
   ``I have old parents and three sisters at home. We all sleep in
one room with a fire or we will freeze to death,'' he said.
   Wood is too expensive for many.
   About two pounds of wood costs seven cents, and it lasts only for
minutes, ``so what we do is pick up everything and anything that
burns'' the shoeshine boy said.
   Even tourists from other climates are finding the India of ``Heat
and Dust,'' the book and screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabwala, has
turned cold.
   Richard and Mary Thomson of Mill Valley, Calif., said they
dreamed of the ``golden rays of tropical Indian sun'' when they
planned their vacation in the subcontinent.
   ``We never thought we would be using this in India,'' Thomson
said Wednesday, pointing at his sweater, his first purchase in an
Indian bazaar.
   ``I had expected India to be much warmer. It is cold, but I am
enjoying it,'' said Eric Eubank, 19, of Frederick, Md., a philosophy
student at St. Andrews Presbyterian College in Laurinburg, N.C.
``When you think of India, you think of the heat and not cold.''
   ``In our country it is cold, too, but there we have centrally
heated homes and offices. Here there is none,'' said Nanna
Rosenstock of Copenhagen, Denmark. ``We manage here, but we wonder
what the poor among the Indians do.''
   Hundreds of people succumb to cold weather in India every year
because they do not have adequate clothing, shelter and food. Some
of those fortunate enough to have homes die of carbon monoxide from
unventilated fires.
   Beggars, migrant laborers and other poorest of the poor are the
hardest hit because they have no shelter. They normally sleep in
parks, on sidewalks or under bridges.
   As nightfall approaches, some head to railway stations and
government-run shelters. Others bribe guards at government buildings
to let them to spend the night in the corridors.
   Private organizations such as churches distribute free blankets
and quilts to the poor. The government has little in the way of
assistance programs, apart from five public shelters, which can
accommodate only a few thousand people.
   ``What can we do?'' asked M. Meshi, spokesman for the New Delhi's
municipal corporation, the capital's administrative organization.
``Every day thousands of people pour into the city looking for jobs.
We can't look after them all.''

joined her husband in his clandestine life, her attorney told a
federal jury Wednesday.
   ``His reasons ... were political. Her reasons were personal,''
attorney William Newman said in opening arguments in defense of
Patricia H. Gros Levasseur, 40.
   Mrs. Levasseur is the wife of co-defendant Raymond Luc Levasseur,
42, of Calais, Maine. The couple and Richard Williams, 41, of
Boston, are on trial in U.S. District Court on charges of seditious
conspiracy, racketeering enterprise and racketeering conspiracy.
   The three are accused of belonging to the United Freedom Front
and the Sam Melville-Jonathan Jackson Unit, a group that allegedly
plotted bombings and bank robberies throughout the Northeast from
1976 until their arrest in 1984. Prosecutors say their purpose was
to overthrow the government.
   Among the 19 bombings they are accused of planning was a 1976
explosion at the Suffolk Superior Courthouse in Boston that injured
22 people.
   Newman told the 12 jurors and five alternates that Mrs. Levasseur
grew up in a large, poor family in eastern Maryland and was deeply
affected by racial segregation and the impact of the Vietnam War on
her neighborhood.
   He said she became active in community work after leaving home,
including literacy and child-care programs, and met Levasseur in
1976 through a prison-reform group in Portland, Maine.
   Newman said Mrs. Levasseur joined her husband in his decision to
live ``away from the eyes and ears of the government'' in 1976
because she had borne his child. The couple had two more children
before they were arrested in November 1984 in Deerfield, Ohio.
   The attorney described her work before her arrest as that of a
full-time mother who participated in school bake sales and took her
children shopping and to doctors' appointments.
   ``She did everything you expect a normal caring mother to do,''
he said. ``The evidence will not establish that she ever robbed a
bank, ever cased a bank, ever drove a getaway car. ... There will be
no proof that she ever built a bomb or ever set a bomb.''
   The trial opened Tuesday with Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael
Loucks saying he intended to show the defendants conspired to bomb
courthouses, military offices and corporations and planned robberies
from Maine to Virginia.
   Levasseur, serving as his own lawyer, called himself a
revolutionary in opening arguments Tuesday and noted that one of the
explosions listed in the indictment occurred shortly after
anti-apartheid demonstrators were fired upon in South Africa.
   He told the jury: ``You ought to ask yourself the question, `Who
are the real criminals? Those who oppose racist acts in South Africa
or those who support government interests in South Africa?'''
   The three defendants were among eight arrested in one of the
largest manhunts in U.S. history. One will be tried separately, two
have have pleaded guilty to charges, and prosecutors dropped charges
against two others because they are already serving long prison
terms.

<HEAD>Farmers Union: `Decoupling' Subsidies From Crops Would Devastate
Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Farmers Union called Wednesday on
Congress to reject a proposal to let farmers collect federal
subsidies without regard to the kind of crops they produce.
   NFU president Leland Swenson said the idea, known as
``decoupling,'' would be ``devastating for farmers and rural
communities, endanger the environment and destablize the position of
Third World farmers.''
   Swenson told a news conference that decoupling would be a
``short-term welfare program'' and will be opposed vigorously by NFU
lobbyists.
   Decoupling has been around for years but has not had great
support on Capitol Hill. One of the early decisions by the incoming
Bush administration will be whether to embrace decoupling as a way
of containing government farm costs.
   The NFU's main rival, the American Farm Bureau Federation, at one
time supported decoupling but since has backed off to give it a
closer look.
   One of the biggest advocates is the Heritage Foundation, a
Washington-based conservative think tank, which recently issued a
task force report saying that one of the first jobs of the Bush
administration should be to cut subsidies and ``get farmers off the
dole.''
   Decoupling, the Heritage report said, would allow federal
payments to farmers to be based on a flat rate and targeted to those
most in need. As it has been for more than half a century, payments
now are pegged to specific kinds of crops and levels of production _
the larger the farm, the larger the subsidy.
   Under decoupling, farmers would simply be given a cash payment
and then be free to grow or not grow any crop they choose.
   ``Planting decisions (with decoupling) would then be based on
market signals _ consumer demand for a product _ rather than on what
is required by Washington,'' the Heritage report said.
   Swenson also released a report analyzing a decoupling bill
introduced by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., in 1985 as the Family
Farm Protection and Full Production Act. He said the bill continues
to have some support in Congress, along with backing from big grain
companies such as Cargill Inc.
   ``It's really a cop-out in addressing the real issue of adopting
and implementing a farm program which enhances the market price for
agricultural commodities,'' Swenson said. ``It implies that the
family farm structure of agricuture is not important.''
   The analysis used figures attributed to the Institute for Trade
and Agricultrure, St. Paul, Minn., showing that the Boschwitz bill
would reduce federal price support loans sharply for major crops,
including wheat to $1.60 per bushel from $2.06 this year, and corn
to $1.30 per bushel from the 1989 rate of $1.65.
   ``Lowering of world prices, a result of decoupling, would
aggravate the situation of Third World farmers, who are our best
potential customers for U.S. food exports,'' Swenson said.
   The NFU, he said, will draft its own alternative to decoupling to
``assure consumers an adequate and dependable supply of food'' and
``enhance the market price of agricultural commodities.''
   Although Swenson did not disclose details of what NFU's plan
might include, he said it would ``reduce the budget impact of farm
programs'' and allow for a continued expansion of agricultural
exports.
   The 1988 drought helped siphon off huge stockpiles of U.S. grain,
boosting market prices for wheat to an average of $3.89 per bushel
last month from $2.70 a year earlier. Corn in December, according to
the Agriculture Department, averaged $2.54 per bushel, compared to
the year-earlier mark of $1.72 per bushel.
   Swenson was asked if the NFU would recommend an increase in
federal price supports to as much as current market prices. He
replied, ``Or higher.''
   The Reagan administration for eight years has been committed to a
market-oriented farm policy, less reliance on federal controls and
freer world trade. Those ideals are expected to continue under the
Bush administration.
   But Swenson is not convinced at this time that foreign countries
will go along with current U.S. agricultural trade objectives in the
Bush administration than they have in the Reagan years.
   ``There isn't such a thing as a free market,'' Swenson said. ``It
doesn't exist, will not exist, either in this country or any other
major exporting country in the world.''

<TEXT>
   The commander of the next space
shuttle mission said Wednesday he is certain engineers will resolve
outstanding tile and engine problems in time to meet a Feb. 23
launch.
   ``All indications are that the people who are working those two
problems are confident they're going to come up with good answers on
both and they should not impact our launch,'' astronaut Michael
Coats said as he an his four crew members held a news conference to
discuss their flight aboard Discovery.
   Atlantis returned from orbit last month with severe damage to
about 200 of the 28,000 tiles that protect it from re-entry heat,
the most tile damage ever sustained by a shuttle. And during
post-flight inspection, two small cracks were found in a bearing
unit in a high-pressure engine turbopump.
   ``The engine problem is probably unique to that engine,'' Coats
said. ``They're looking at Discovery's engines now, and they have
spare turbopumps in case they have to make a replacement.''
   Engineers believe the cracks were caused by moisture that somehow
penetrated the housing that holds the bearing.
   Coats, who flew on one previous shuttle mission, a Discovery
flight in August 1984, said it appeared that Atlantis' tiles were
damaged by insulation falling off the nose cone of one of the solid
fuel booster rockets during liftoff.
   ``We're concerned about what caused the damage and are confident
it will be resolved,'' he said. ``But we're also reassured because
despite all the damage Atlantis' tiles took, it survived. I'm sure
our tiles will get us through re-entry. I'm not going to have
butterflies about it.''
   Discovery's five-day flight is set for liftoff at 8:30 a.m. EST
on Feb. 23. Flying with Coats will be pilot John Blaha and mission
specialists Robert Springer, James Buchli and James Bagian. Buchli
is the only other shuttle veteran on the crew; he flew aboard
Discovery in January 1983.
   Their main task will be to deploy a tracking and data relay
satellite to complete a network of payloads that will enable ground
control centers to communicate almost full time with the space
shuttle and with several unmanned satellites.
   The astronauts will conduct several scientific and medical
experiments, including one in which four rats will be used to
determine how well injured bones heal in the weightlessness of
space. The legs of the rats will be deliberately cut before launch.
   ``The bone reparation process is an interesting question that has
to be answered before man takes extended space flights,'' said
Bagian, a medical doctor who will observe the rats in orbit.
   The crew also will use a powerful IMAX camera to record damage
that man and nature are causing to planet Earth.
   ``From space, astronauts can see how fragile Earth really is,''
said Springer. ``We want to document it.''
   Among the things the camera will photograph, he said, are
volcanoes in Nicaragua and Indonesia, areas that have been
deforested in Brazil and Madagascar, the Sahara desert in Africa,
and beach erosion around the globe.
   Discovery's flight will be the third for a shuttle since the 1986
Challenger disaster, and Coats said, ``We're anxious to show that
we're back in the space business to stay on a routine basis.''
   He said the mission will be a good kickoff to a busy year in
which seven shuttle launches are planned, including the first two
that will dispatch probes to the planets _ Magellan to Venus in
April and Galileo to Jupiter in October.

<HEAD>Former Lover Denies That He Is Publicity-Seeking Opportunist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rock Hudson's former lover denied Wednesday
that he filed an $11 million lawsuit against the late screen idol's
estate because he was left out of Hudson's will or because he wanted
the publicity.
   Marc Christian told Los Angeles County Superior Court jurors that
he filed the civil lawsuit because ``Rock Hudson continued to have
sex with me when he found out he had AIDS.''
   Christian, 35, said Hudson's secretary, Mark Miller, also hid
news about the illness from him until he saw a television newscast
revealing that Hudson had AIDS.
   The actor died from complications of the disease in October 1985.
   The defense had portrayed Christian in opening statements Friday
as a publicity seeker and an opportunist who was angry because he
was left out of Hudson's will after their 2{-year relationship.
Christian, an aspiring musician, denied both allegations.
   ``I knew that by filing this lawsuit I'd never have an
opportunity to work in this town,'' Christian said during
questioning by his attorney. ``Anyone who wants a career in
Hollywood cannot divulge he's homosexual.''
   Christian's emotional distress lawsuit alleges bodily injury,
mental suffering and damages for fraud and deceit against the will's
executor, Miller and an unspecified number of doctors.
   Christian has tested negative for AIDS antibodies, but claims he
will be susceptible to the disease for a lifetime. Some medical
experts believe antibodies will be detected no later than six months
after a sexual encounter with an infected partner.
   Attorneys for Christian have said the key issue in the lawsuit is
whether Hudson's doctors had a duty to tell Christian he was being
exposed to the disease by engaging in sex with the actor.

   A judge has rejected a request to cover
a courtroom mural of the biblical character King Solomon during the
trial of a man accused of killing a mother and her young daughter.
   The mural behind Shelby Circuit Court Judge Charles O'Conner's
bench depicts King Solomon's decision in the case of two women who
claimed to be the mother of the same infant.
   Solomon threatened to cut the baby in half and give part to each
woman before one asked him to spare the child and give him to the
other. Solomon then knew that the woman willing to give up the child
to save its life must be the real mother.
   The painting depicts a soldier ready to strike the infant with a
sword.
   Lawyer Michael McDaniel said the painting could bias the jury
against his client, James Kenneth Utley, charged in the death of
Karen Smith and her 3-year-old daughter, Jacqueline, in their New
Washington home in February.
   McDaniel also said Clark County Prosecutor Jerome Jacobi has a
habit of making Biblical references during trials. During a recent
murder trial, Jacobi referred to the story of Cain and Abel,
McDaniel said.
   The judge rejected McDaniel's motion Tuesday and instructed
Jacobi not to refer to the mural during the trial, which is to begin
Jan. 31.
   The case was venued to Shelby County because of publicity in
Clark County.

<HEAD>Greek-Turkish Dispute Turned Over To Ministers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greek-Turkish dispute that is blocking
accord on a date for new East-West arms talks has been turned over
to NATO foreign ministers who will try to break the deadlock,
diplomats said Wednesday.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
solution was unlikely before Thursday, although meetings continued
in Vienna to try to break the impasse.
   The deadlock also threatened to hold up a landmark human rights
agreement by the 35-nation Helsinki review conference, whose final
document must include a mandate for new arms talks.
   Washington had insisted Wednesday as a deadline for agreement on
new East-West talks on reducing conventional forces and weapons
across Europe, said a source in another western delegation.
   Agreement on the arms talks has been stymied by a Greek-Turkish
dispute involving the eastern Mediterranean port of Mersin, which
Turkey wants excluded from the talks.
   The port is a main shipping point for supplies to northern
Cyprus, which is controlled by Turkey.
   The Soviet Union agreed to exclude the port, but Greece _
traditionally wary of Turkey and concerned about Cyprus _ is
insisting Mersin be included.
   Western diplomatic sources expressing frustration over the
impasse said they had turned the dispute over to unidentified NATO
foreign ministers for resolution.
   The talks are to encompass conventional weapons and troops across
Europe from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
They will replace the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks,
which began in Vienna in 1973 and continue without agreement.
   Meanwhile, Austria has invited the foreign ministers of the 34
other nations in the Helsinki review conference to Vienna next week
for ceremonies to close the conference, which began in November 1986.
   Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said Wednesday he was
confident the ceremonies would go ahead as planned.
   But one diplomat said the arrangements hung ``on a fine thread.''
   The mandate for the new arms talks must be included in the final
document wrapping up the Helsinki conference. That document should
be ready by Friday if Mock's plans are to hold.
   If the conference is not wrapped up next week, there could be a
delay of several weeks while the Administration of President-elect
George Bush takes over, diplomats say.
   If that happens, nations unhappy with certain points of the
Helsinki draft accord might demand it be changed, diplomats fear.
   Romania already has objected to 17 key human rights provisions,
but has not said whether it would reject the document, which must be
approved by all 35 nations for passage.
   The United States, Canada, Soviet Union and all European nations
except Albania are taking part in the Helsinki review conference.

   Britain's Duchess of York and former
Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos topped the heap of Worst-Dressed
Women of 1988 unveiled Wednesday by Mr. Blackwell.
   Other fashion frumps included actress Debra Winger, pop
star-actress Madonna, funny lady Roseanne Barr and Marilyn Quayle,
wife of the vice president-elect.
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, also used
the occasion of his 29th annual Worst-Dressed list to lash out at
Barbra Streisand, who wasn't on the list but whose hairdo was worthy
of comment. He even wrote her a check.
   ``This is a $250 check available to any hairdresser who would
dare try,'' he said. Miss Streisand was a worst-dressed selection in
1983 and occupies Blackwell's lifetime hall of fame with Elizabeth
Taylor, Charlene Tilton, Bette Midler and Christine Onassis.
   Blackwell, a designer and self-appointed fashion arbiter, had
nice things to say about a limited list of Fabulous Fashion
Independents, which included Liza Minnelli, Ivana Trump, Barbara
Walters and first lady-to-be Barbara Bush.
   ``Barbara Bush is going to bring back vanilla ice cream and apple
pie. It is going to be pure mid-America,'' Blackwell said.
   Leading the 12 women on Blackwell's fashion wrath was the former
Sarah Ferguson. ``The palace milkmaid strikes again,'' he said. He
called Mrs. Marcos ``an over-the-hill actress auditioning for
Evita.''
   Third place went to Miss Winger, followed by Madonna; Mrs.
Quayle, and Shirley Temple Black. Three celebrity offspring tied for
seventh place: Lisa Marie Presley, Carrie Hamilton and Katie Wagner.
Jamie Lee Curtis was No. 8, with Jodie Foster ninth and Miss Barr
last.

   Protesters demanding the release of Nelson Mandela
and other jailed activists marked the 1,000 day of their protest
Thursday on a sidewalk outside the South African Embassy.
   Visitors to this city's famous Trafalgar Square often treat the
protesters like a permanent fixture. Sympathizers stop and chat.
Foreign tourists and embassy callers seeking visas shoot the breeze.
Pop singer Boy George once joined the protesters for an hour or so.
   Passers-by and local shop owners send food, hot drinks and
greetings cards.
   The pickets have persisted through cold, wind, rain and more than
600 arrests, mostly for obstruction. Magistrates' courts have thrown
out most of the charges, according to the City of London
Anti-Apartheid Group, which runs the protest.
   ``I think all the fresh air has helped to keep me healthy,'' said
Lorna Reid, 23, from Edinburgh, who joined the picket on its first
day _ April 19, 1986. She still does six-hour shifts despite 14
arrests.
   The embassy says it has occasionally called the police to deal
with ``mischievous incidents'' but accepts the pickets' right to be
there under British law.
   The protest usually consists of three or four young people at any
one time. They distribute leaflets and magazines, display banners
and fly the black, green and yellow flag of the African National
Congress from a pole mounted in an auto tire.
   ANC leader Mandela, 70, is the most prominent of anti-apartheid
activists jailed in South Africa.
   He was convicted of sabotage and subversion in 1964 and jailed
for life. Last year, he was admitted to a hospital with tuberculosis
and later transferred to a home on a prison farm.
   The picketers have received thanks from his wife, Winnie.
   Mandela and the other prisoners are fighting their nation's
apartheid system. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The London demonstrators ask passers-by to sign a petition for
release of the South African prisoners. They say they have collected
over 1 million signatures.
   ``We had a few hundred members when we started, and we have 1,600
now, all races, including people who have been in prison in South
Africa,'' said Carol Brickley, one of the protest leaders. ``We have
three rules for the picket: no drink, no drugs, behave.''
   Two police officers face the protest around the clock near the
embassy's public entrance. Another officer guards the staff entrance
around the corner.
   The protest was branded a ``scourge'' in May 1988 by John
Carlisle, a lawmaker of the governing Conservative Party. He urged
that police be empowered to remove it, but the government did not
respond.
   Some protesters say cold may be an even bigger scourge to them
than hostile politicians.
   ``Cold is the first thing you have to learn to deal with. We wear
a lot of thin layers of clothing,'' said 18-year-old Mark Farmaner.

<TEXT>
   Police are worried that radical leftists may mount
terrorist attacks, possibly with homemade missiles, when more than
100 foreign dignitaries arrive for Emperor Hirohito's funeral, an
official said Wednesday.
   The National Police Agency official said security forces for next
month's funeral would exceed those at the May 1986 Tokyo summit of
seven major industrial nations. He said they numbered 30,000 at that
event.
   He said at least six ultra-leftist groups have threatened to
sabotage the Feb. 24 funeral for the emperor, who died Saturday at
the age of 87. Japanese leftists have demanded abolition of the
monarchy, which plays a largely symbolic role under Japan's
post-World War II constitution.
   President-elect George Bush is to head the U.S. delegation to the
funeral. Other expected dignitaries include Prince Philip of
Britain, the kings of Sweden and Belgium, and presidents Suharto of
Indonesia and Mauno Koivist of Finland.
   The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
about 10,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony in the
Shinjuku Imperial Garden in central Tokyo.
   In addition, he said, ``We have to guard almost the entire city
of Tokyo because more than 100 guests from abroad will probably be
staying in different places in Tokyo for a few days before and after
the funeral.''
   Officials view one of the main threats as Chukaku-ha, or Middle
Core Faction, a left-wing guerrilla group that fired several
missiles at the site of the 1986 summit. They overshot their target,
and no injuries were reported.
   The group has vowed an attack on the Hirohito funeral and
ceremonies for the new emperor, Akihito.
   Police believe the group has the technology to fire a missile
more than 2{ miles, and ``they may have even more advanced
technology today,'' the official said.
   ``If the funeral site was attacked by such a bomb, the casualties
would be bound to be enormous,'' he said. ``If anything happened to
any of the foreign guests while they were in Japan, it definitely
would develop into major diplomatic problems.''
   He said police plan to set up several hundred checkpoints to
control incoming traffic on most major streets in Tokyo.
   ``The best defense is to prevent the group from bringing in
dangerous members within (missile-) projection range,'' he said.
   The Japanese Red Army also has declared it would ``blow up'' the
funeral, but the official said that group was less capable of
mounting a domestic attack. In recent years, it has been operating
mainly outside the country.
   The group is blamed for at least seven major terrorist acts
worldwide, including a 1973 attack at Lod Airport in Israel in which
24 people were killed. In 1987, it bombed a U.S. servicemen's club
in Naples, Italy, killing five people, including a U.S. servicewoman.
   The official said the Red Army may be targeting Japanese
embassies abroad, which are accepting condolence calls for the late
emperor.
   ``They could disguise themselves, walk into embassies, and occupy
them and demand the release of their colleagues under arrest in
Japan,'' he said.
   To help embassies and authorities abroad, police have distributed
25,000 English-language posters with pictures of Red Army members
believed to be outside Japan. In Japan, they plan to put up 300,000
similar posters to help find any members who sneaked back home, the
official said.

<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating a General Electric
admission that test records may have been falsified at a factory
which made parts for the engine that failed on a jetliner in
England, according to court documents and federal officials.
   The Seattle factory which made parts for the CFM56 engine used by
the Boeing 737 also manufactured a check and flow valve for the F404
engine aboard the Navy's FA-18 fighter, GE spokesman Richard Kennedy
said Wednesday.
   A letter from a GE attorney last year said test records may have
been falsified for the fighter plane valves. Papers filed by the
office of the U.S. attorney in Cincinnati said the FBI is
investigating that case.
   Forty-four people died in the Boeing 737 crash, in which the crew
apparently turned off the right engine after the left engine failed
for unexplained reasons. The investigation of the crash is
continuing.
   The timer valve manufactured by GE for the CFM56 engine on the
737 could not have caused the turbine to fail even if the valve
malfunctioned, Kennedy said in telephone interview from his office
in Cincinnati.
   However, GE attorney Robert C. Anderson said in a letter dated
June 2, 1988, that: ``In late May 1988, it was discovered that prior
to July 1987, a particular flow leak check, which is required by
GEAE (General Electric Aircraft Engine) specifications, was not
performed on the F404 check and drain valves.''
   ``It is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983,
possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken,'' Anderson
said the letter, obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``The test was reinstituted in July 1987 when the problem was
detected by lower level personnel in the plant,'' the letter said.
   ``During the period involved, it is also believed that operators
may have falsified internal test records which are maintained to
reflect actual test readings,'' Anderson said in the letter.
   Anderson's letter does not indicate the total number of engines
or their value, but said that the deliveries covered the periods of
April-May 1984, April-May 1985, April-May 1986, and April-May 1987.
   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Nettie Johnson said that the F404 was used
in the FA-18 fighter, but was unable to say immediately whether the
aircraft had experienced problems from faulty check and drain valves.
   Defense Department officials said they had received Anderson's
letter as part of what they called a ``voluntary disclosure
program'' for companies that believe they have not met the terms of
their contracts.
   The inspector general's office in the Pentagon, in conjunction
with the FBI, is investigating the admissions in the letter, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``In nearly every instance of voluntary disclosure, an
investigation follows,'' said one source who was familiar with the
case. ``Falsifying records falls into the area of product
substitution, in which the government pays for something to be
tested, and it is not tested.''
   James Helmer, an attorney representing the former manager of the
GE plant, said his client had been questioned in connection with the
investigation last Oct. 14 by two FBI agents and a representative of
the Air Force.
   Helmer's client, Anthony L. Divencenzo, filed suit against
General Electric last year on behalf of the government, seeking to
recover damages for more than 2,000 F404 engines that Helmer said
were delivered without inspection.
   At the request of the Justice Department, all documents in the
Divencenzo suit remained under seal until last Friday, when U.S.
District Court Judge Carl Rubin denied a federal motion to allow the
Justice Department until Feb. 1 to decide whether to join the case
as a plaintiff.
   The motion, filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Gerald F. Kaminski,
said ``the investigation of the allegations set forth in the
complaint that is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is not complete due to the factual complexities
involved in the case.''
   ``While the criminal investigation may take substantially longer
to conclude, it is anticipated that the FBI will obtain sufficient
information to determine whether or not it will intervene herein,''
said the federal motion.
   The Justice, Defense and Navy Departments will require another
week to review that information, the motion said.
   Michael Crites, U.S. attorney for Cincinnati, declined to diclose
further details of the investigation or indicate when the government
would decide whether to intervene.
   ``I can't say anything more than what was in that motion, which
is a matter of public record,'' Crites said in a telephone
interview. Asked when the government would make its decision, Crites
said: ``I don't have a timetable on it.''

<HEAD>Decline in Smoking `a Revolution' _ Koop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on Wednesday
urged Americans to continue the gains made over the last 25 years in
the fight against smoking by aiming efforts at women, young people
and others likely to pick up the habit.
   Koop said the decline in the proportion of American smokers from
40 percent of the population in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987 was ``a
revolution in smoking behavior.''
   But he said the fact that 50 million Americans still smoke, that
women are quitting more slowly than men and that young people are
continuing to start presents ``enormous challenges in continuing the
downward trend in smoking.''
   Koop spoke at a news conference at which he issued a new
government report on smoking that documents changes that have
occurred in the 25 years since the surgeon general first declared
cigarette smoking caused cancer and death.
   He said anti-smoking campaigns have educated the public about the
hazards of smoking, and a growing number of states, communities and
businesses are enacting smoking restrictions. But more efforts are
needed, he said.
   ``During the next quarter century and beyond, progress will be
slow, and smoking-related mortality will remain high, unless the
health community more effectively reaches children and adolescents,
women, minorities and blue-collar workers,'' he said in the report.
   Meanwhile, the Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry's lobbying
organization, was running full-page ads in major newspapers around
the country this week supporting smokers and declaring ``Enough is
enough!''
   The ads said there has been ``enough'' taxation, legislation,
control, censorship, harassment and discrimination directed against
smokers.
   Koop discounted the institute's claims, including its point that
smokers pay $10 billion in cigarette taxes, which the lobbying group
called ``more than their fair share.'' Koop said that adds up to
only 30 percent of the direct health costs the government pays to
take care of smoking-related illnesses and disabilities.
   He added, ``The tobacco people should begin to discriminate
against advertising to the very people who have the highest problem
with smoking, namely teen-agers and those in minority groups and
those who are blue-collar workers.''
   Instead, he said, cigarette manufacturers appear to be aiming
many of their ads at young people to lure them into the smoking
habit.
   ``If you look at advertising now compared to 15 years ago, you'll
find that the models have gotten extraordinarily young, beautiful,
chic, sophisticated and sexy. And if that isn't something that isn't
appealing to young people, I don't know what is.''
   Figures in Koop's report showed that anti-smoking efforts have
been most successful in getting men to quit. Half of all men smoked
in 1965, but by 1987, less than a third were lighting up.
   Women smokers declined from 32 percent to 27 percent over the
period, the report said.
   The figures also show a slow decline over the period among blacks
and blue-collar workers and virtually no change among those who
never graduated from high school.
   Among high school seniors, daily cigarette smoking dropped from
29 percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980 and then leveled off in the
18-21 percent range for the seven years after that.

   Carlos Fajardo took his family
across the Rainbow Bridge into Canada and lost the pot of gold that
had been their lives in the United States.
   Fajardo, who struggled for 20 years to leave his native Cuba,
accidentally deported himself and his family by crossing the border
on a 20-minute sightseeing trip Dec. 23.
   Even though the family lived in the United States for four years,
federal immigration officials will not allow them back because they
are illegal aliens.
   They are stranded in a motel in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
   ``We came for 20 minutes,'' Fajardo said. ``No one told us we
could not go back.''
   Fajardo, 39, a small, soft-spoken man, said the ordeal began Dec.
20, when they set out from their home in Miami on a Christmas quest
to find snow, which his adopted children, Yoandys, 12, and Yordalys,
9, had never seen.
   As he spoke Tuesday, his wife and children sat watching
television in their small motel room. He would occassionally turn to
the boy, Yoandys, to help him answer in English.
   Fajardo said the quest brought them 1,500 miles in their truck to
Niagara Falls, N.Y., where they checked into a motel and planned to
visit Canada. He told Canadian border guards his family wanted to
see the Horseshoe Falls.
   When they returned, however, U.S. border guards demanded to see
proof of their citizenship. All Fajardo had was a Florida driver's
license.
   At first, Fajardo maintained that he was a U.S. citizen. Later he
said he was a resident alien. But immigration officials, after a
search of their records, determined otherwise.
   Benedict Ferro, director of the federal Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in Buffalo, said Fajardo's wife,
Bermaida, and her two children entered the United States illegally
in 1985 and that Fajardo entered the country illegally in 1986.
   Fajardo denies entering the country illegally.
   An immigration judge in 1987 denied asylum to Mrs. Fajardo and
the two children. She appealed the decision in August on grounds
that she would face persecution if returned to Cuba, but her appeal
was rejected.
   Fajardo's application for asylum was pending when he crossed the
border. His status was officially nullified by leaving the country,
Ferro said.
   Fajardo could reapply, but his wife and children cannot because
they previously provided fraudulent information to immigration
officials, Ferro said.
   ``The family lied and their credibility is about zero at this
point,'' Ferro said.
   Canadian authorities have given the family permission to stay in
Canada until Sunday. What happens to them after that is uncertain.
   U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., urged immigration officials to
allow the family to return to Florida for humanitarian reasons.
   ``This family has strong ties to the Miami community through
relatives, business and local school attendence,'' Graham said in a
letter Tuesday to INS officials. ``It would be comforting to these
people for them to be able to resume their well-established lives.''
   Under terms of a bond he posted in order to leave Cuba, Fajardo
agreed not to return to his homeland. He said he left the country in
1984 with only the clothes on his back.
   He achieved relative prosperity in the United States working a
number of jobs, including his current one as a boat builder, and
said he owns a home in Miami.
   It has been nearly three weeks since the family checked into the
motel in Ontario, and they've seen more than enough snow.
   ``We are all very tired,'' he said. ``The children are missing
school ... We want to go home.''
   Now the family is running low on money, said sister Margaret
Quinn of Fort Erie, Ontario, who has been providing assistance
through the Niagara Refugee Committee.
   Sister Quinn has urged American and Canadian immigration
officials to allow the stranded family to return to the care of
their relatives in Miami, but says the case seems to be closed.
   ``It's really contrary to the whole spirit of international law
and relations to have them walking about without a country,'' she
said. ``This whole thing is really a mess.''

<HEAD>State Department Says Soviets Troop Withdrawal From Afghanistan Has
Resumed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Ap Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has resumed its troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan despite an impasse in negotiations with
U.S.-armed rebels over a future government in Kabul, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Transports carried troops out of the country while other elements
of the Red Army streamed northward from the Soviet garrison in the
capital, spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   The Soviets agreed last April to withdraw all forces by Feb. 15,
but declared a suspension in November to protest attacks by the
U.S.-backed rebels on departing units. About 50,000 troops remain in
the country.
   The United States had urged the Mujahadeen to hold their fire,
but the collapse last Saturday of negotiations between the Soviets
and the rebels on a government to succeed the pro-Moscow regime in
Kabul raised new obstacles.
   Returning to Moscow, Yuli Vorontsov, a first deputy foreign
minister who is also ambassador to Afghanistan, warned on Tuesday
that there was ``serious danger'' that the Soviets would not meet
the Feb. 15 deadline.
   He said whether the 50,000 troops could be withdrawn within five
weeks would depend on the Afghan guerrillas' willingness to accept a
cease-fire and on the outcome of negotiations to form a new
government.
   Most observers expect President Najibullah's regime to collapse
once it loses the backing of Soviet troops who helped wage a
nine-year war with the guerrillas.
   Reagan administration officials responded they still expected the
Soviets to meet their commitment. Some Western observers in Moscow
were quoted as seeing Vorontsov's warning as an attempt to pressure
the rebels into a political settlement.
   Even so, Redman said, ``We continue to see evidence that the
Soviets are in the process of preparing to withdraw.''
   He said ``these signs include the overland movement north of
Soviet troops from the Kabul garrison in recent days, and the
closure of the Soviet military hospital in Kabul.''
   Moreover, Redman said, ``we have noted an increase in flights by
Aeroflot transport aircraft into and out of the Kabul airport.''
   His statement apparently was based on Western intelligence
reports, and the U.S. official declined to provide further details.

   Support for civil rights measures and steps to
assist the poor are growing nationwide, according to a survey of
racial attitudes released Wednesday.
   ``Americans do have a conscience,'' pollster Louis Harris told a
news conference in unveiling the survey taken by his organization on
behalf of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
   He said surveys began to find an increase in support for civil
rights measures, such as the busing of pupils to achieve school
integration, as early as 1986. The latest poll said opposition to
busing has dropped to 54 percent among all Americans after hovering
at 78 percent for three decades.
   It found 57 percent of whites opposed to busing but said that,
for the first time, 51 percent of whites favor it when the buses
carry pupils to top quality schools in the inner city and blacks to
equally good schools outside their neighborhoods.
   The survey found that 93 percent of whites and 95 percent of
blacks favored special school programs beginning at age 8 to
motivate poor youngsters to stay in school.
   It said 90 percent of whites and 95 percent of blacks favored
setting up federal camps where poor young people could learn
reading, writing and other skills. Similar majorities supported
business incentives to provide jobs in poor neighborhoods.
   Seventy-nine percent of blacks and 81 percent of whites said the
best long-term way to combat crime was not ``to spend large sums of
money sending criminals to prison and keeping them there a long
time'' but to ``spend the same money attacking the causes of crime,
such as reducing poverty, keeping young people in school and
motivating young people to succeed rather than become criminals.''
   The poll was taken June 3 through Sept. 12 by Louis Harris and
Associates and was based on interviews with more than 3,000 people.
Harris said that the error margin was plus or minus 2 percent.
   The New York-based NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc.
was founded in 1940 by the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People but is now a separate and distinct organization.
It has been a part of many major civil rights court battles in
recent decades and for the last 12 years has also campaigned in the
legislative arena.
   ``The survey demonstrates that the public is primed for
presidential action and leadership on race-relations issues,'' said
Elaine Jones, deputy director-counsel of the organization. ``The
missing ingredient is strong leadership. That's what we look to the
new administration to provide.''
   She was critical of the Reagan administration's record but added
that there is reason to hope that the inauguration of George Bush
will usher in a new approach to civil rights at the White House and
in the Justice Department.
   Julius Chambers, the group's director-counsel, said the study,
titled ``The Unfinished Agenda on Race in America'' demonstrates
there is ``a solid base of support'' for change.
   ``On issue after issue, blacks and whites agree that active
leadership is needed to bring about real equality between the
races,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Thailand joined Vietnam on Wednesday in
pledging to press forward efforts to remove Vietnamese troops from
Cambodia.
   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand told a news
conference that he believes a settlement will be well in place by
September. Cambodia's pro-Hanoi government suggested last week that
Vietnamese troops could withdraw by then if Thailand denies
sanctuary to Cambodian guerrillas and countries, including Thailand,
halt aid to rebels.
   ``I think after September, everything will be all right,'' the
Thai foreign minister said Wednesday. ``The motion will be in full
spin.''
   Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's foreign minister, said Monday said
after Vietnamese-Thai talks that: ``Both sides are satisfied.
   ``Both sides have agreed it (the Cambodian conflict) will be
solved soon ... by September 1989 within the framework of a
political settlement,'' said Thach, also deputy premier.
   Vietnam has said it will pull out its forces by 1990 regardless
of a political settlement.
   President Heng Samrin of Cambodia said last week that 50,000
Vietnamese troops are in Cambodia, but Western intelligence
officials estimate the number at about 65,000. Guerrillas say
120,000 Vietnamese troops are in the country. Calling his meetings
with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi on Monday and Tuesday a ``turning
point'' in relations, Siddhi said Wednesday: ``We must now seek to
speed up the efforts to achieve a political settlement.''
   However, he denied Cambodian resistance groups were provided
refuge in his country, saying, ``We don't have any sanctuary in
Thailand. We have (refugee) camps.''
   Asked Thailand's position on Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, Siddhi
said: ``We do not count Pol Pot as a person to come back.... As for
the Khmer Rouge, we feel we will discuss it.'' He said the group
might be acceptable in a coalition government.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the bloody Khmer
Rouge, during whose rule hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were
killed.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of a three-party
resistance coalition battling the Soviet-backed Vietnamese. China
and Thailand back the coalition, and the United States supports the
two non-communist groups in it.
   Siddhi, who is to visit China soon, said he wanted Beijing and
Moscow to join in peace talks on Cambodia.
   One round of informal talks was held in Indonesia last year among
the government of Cambodia, the guerrilla groups, Vietnam, Laos and
the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. That
group, which includes Thailand, is trying to arrange a second
meeting in Jakarta for February.

   Iranian President Ali Khamenei on
Wednesday ordered lifting on some controls over foreign trade in a
move that may further bolster the resurgent private sector in Iran's
post-war economy.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted Khamenei as saying the Commerce Ministry should ease its grip
on the economy and ``hand over some responsibilities, such as trade,
to the people.''
   ``Our brave, smart and mature people are not lacking anything and
can do the job themselves,'' Khamenei said in a reference to the
private sector.
   The ministry controls more than 80 percent of Iran's trade.
   The government has been relaxing the tight controls imposed
during its eight-year war with Iraq. The two sides signed a
cease-fire in August.
   The cash-strapped government has been trying to attract private
funds to pay for imports to ease shortages. Widespread corruption in
the government's bloated bureaucracy is also believed to be a reason
for easing state control.
   A heated debate over the economy has dragged on for years and
polarized Iran's leadership into pragmatists led by Khamenei and
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and hardliners such as Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi.
   The huge task of post-war reconstruction has brought the
differences into sharp focus. Moves by the pragmatists to relax
political and social restrictions as well as economic restraints
have intensified the wrangles.
   Khamenei is backed by a wealthy merchant class, known as
bazaaris, who largely financed the 1979 revolution which brought to
power the Islamic regime under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The
merchants have pushed for a more laissez-faire economy.
   Musavi, under fire for his economic policies during the war,
seeks wider state control, as he says, to ``lessen the gap between
rich and poor.''
   The government last month listed about 40 scarce items that could
be privately imported for a trial period of two years. They ranged
from medical equipment and agricultural products to pens and books.
   Acting Commerce Minister Abdolhassan Vahhaji said more items will
be deregulated. He said that ``with the implementation of this plan,
the prices of goods will come down and it will create economic calm
and stability.''

<HEAD>73-Year-Old Cancer Patient Jailed In Sewer Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What began as a dispute over a $200 fee
for a sewer line extension led to prison Wednesday for a 73-year-old
man with cancer who said he rejected a no-cost solution out of
principle.
   ``I'm going to prison so maybe I can help someone else they're
discriminating against,'' said Wilburt Siegel, a retired metal
worker who suffers from rectal cancer.
   Siegel likened his six-month sentence for contempt of court to a
life term because he said a judge could keep him in jail as long as
he refused to budge from his position that utility officials gave
him unequal service.
   A large American flag hung from the porch of Siegel's modest
James Island home and yellow ribbons were tied around towering pines
as Sheriff Al Cannon escorted him away for the 40-mile trip to the
Lieber Correctional Institution.
   The decade-long battle that led to Siegal's imprisonment was a
dispute over an ordinary sewer connection that officials have ``bent
over backwards'' to resolve, said Ray Patterson, chairman of the
James Island Public Service District.
   The Siegels paid a tap-in fee in 1979 but, when the sewer line
was laid, it ended at the corner of their lot. They said it was too
far away and would require them to spend $2,000 and take down four
large pine trees to make the connection.
   Siegel said the line should be extended in front of his house
where a straight, 30-foot connection could be made. The utility was
willing to extend the line at the time, but the Siegels would have
been billed $200 more, said Patterson.
   ``They didn't want to pay the $200 at the time,'' said Patterson,
who said the work would cost the public $1,200 today.
   Patterson said it would cost only $700 to connect to the corner
tap and the commissioners even offered to come out on their own time
and dig the ditch.
   A Charleston Heights plumber offered to make the connection for
free on Tuesday, but the Siegels declined, saying they didn't want
charity.
   ``What's the difference where the tap is if somebody puts it in
free and you don't have to pay for it?,'' Patterson said, adding the
Siegels were ``just looking for publicity and to get sympathy.''
   Siegel's wife, Hattie, said the issue is fair treatment.
   ``We never asked for money. We want to be treated the way other
people are treated,'' she said, adding other area residents have
taps much nearer their houses.
   Siegel said more than 100 homes haven't tapped into the system
but he was the one who was singled out and eventually arrested.
   ``I'm not scared because I'm going to jail. I'm doing this to
show my rights to America. Six months is a long time for anybody to
go to jail, especially on a charge like this,'' he said.
   Patterson said other cases are being handled on a case-by-case
basis.
   A Nov. 1 order signed by Circuit Judge William Howell found
Siegel in contempt of a 1986 ruling that he make the connection.
Howell gave Siegel 60 days to hook up or go to prison.
   Siegel will appear in court after serving his sentence and
predicted he'll probably be returned to prison.
   ``I have a life sentence for not hooking up to an unequal sewer
line,'' he said.
   The Siegels had brought a $500,000 federal lawsuit against the
utility challenging its right to require the sewer connection. That
action was dismissed last year.

   The 1988 cotton crop is expected to be at a
seven-year high of 15.4 million bales, up 5 percent from the 1987
harvest and 2 percent more than forecast last month, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   In its new estimate based on Jan. 1 conditions, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said production would be the largest
since 15.6 million bales in 1981.
   Orange production, estimated at 215 million boxes, is up 7
percent from last season but forecast at about the same level as in
December.
   The report did not include new 1988 production figures for other
major crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans. An annual report on
those commodities will be issued on Friday.
   But the report said lack of moisture continued to be a problem
through December for winter wheat in the central and southern plains.
   ``By month's end, snow cover was improved but still limited in
some areas,'' the report said. ``Despite limited snow cover in
Colorado and Montana, wind damage was light. Russian wheat aphids
were a problem in Oregon and Washington during most of the month.''
   Hay inventories on farms as of Dec. 1, 1988, were reported at
90.9 million tons, down 24 percent from holdings a year earlier and
25 percent below the level of Dec. 1, 1986.

   The Labor Department on Wednesday honored four
late labor leaders and workers' advocates as the first members of
its Hall of Fame.
   The inductees were Samuel Gompers, John R. Commons, Cyrus S.
Ching and Frances Perkins.
   In 1933, Perkins became the first woman named to a president's
Cabinet, taking the job of labor secretary during the Depression.
During her tenure, Perkins directed the drafting and enactment of
the law creating Social Security and a minimum wage.
   Gompers, a British-born cigarmaker, was the first president of
the American Federation of Labor, the forerunner of the AFL-CIO.
   Commons was a University of Wisconsin professor considered a
pioneer in the fields of economics and trade union studies.
   Ching was an official of the U.S. Rubber Co. and early supporter
of collective bargaining. He also was the first director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.

   The commander of U.N. observers monitoring
the Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola said Wednesday he is
satisfied he will be able to verify their departure independently,
despite South Africa's reservations.
   ``I think there will be no difficulties in carrying this
assignment out,'' Brazilian Gen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes told
reporters who asked about the abilities of his 10-nation team of 70
military and 20 civilian observers.
   Also in Luanda on Wednesday, Jesse Jackson said the United States
has a moral obligation to support the peace process it has mediated
in Angola, instead of destabilizing the government by backing
right-wing rebels.
   Ferreira Gomes said the success of his 27-month mission depends
on the good will of the Angolan and Cuban governments, which are to
supply precise numbers of Cuban troops in the country.
   South African Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha has expressed
doubts about relying on Angolan and Cuban figures.
   On Dec. 22, the three countries signed a U.S.-brokered agreement
for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, paving the
way for the independence of the South African-controlled territory
of Namibia, also called South-West Africa.
   Cuba first sent troops to Luanda in 1975 to support President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos' Angolan Popular Liberation Movement in its
fight against South African-backed rebels of UNITA, the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   UNITA, which has about 25,000 fighters, was not party to
December's agreement and says it will continue attacking government
troops.
   On Tuesday, a symbolic contingent of 450 Cubans departed by plane
for Havana. U.N. observer Col. Arvid Geirulv of Norway said they
were followed Wednesday by 1,000 more troops on a Soviet ship.
   Under the agreement, 3,000 Cuban troops are to have left by April
1.
   Ferreira Gomes said he was informed all 3,000 will be gone by
Sunday.
   He said 50,000 was the ``basic figure'' for the number of Cuban
troops to be withdrawn, but Angola and Cuba are to furnish exact
figures once the observer mission is officially established April 1.
All the troops are to be out by mid-1991.
   ``We don't have the information about with what regularity the
Cubans rotate their troops,'' he said, ``but we are certain they
will all be withdrawn.''
   Asked about UNITA claims that some Cuban troops have been granted
Angolan citizenship to enable them to remain in the country, he said
his mission was to verify numbers of troops withdrawn, not
nationalities.
   He said the unarmed observer force would check the number of
troops actually departing from four ports and one airport against
lists furnished by the Cubans and Angolans.
   The general said Angola's government is committed to providing
transport to U.N. observers, who have a mandate to travel anywhere
in the country.
   But land mines and the guerrilla presence makes road travel
difficult in most of this country 14 times the size of Portugal.
   ``If we get information from whatever source that there are Cuban
troops where they should not be, we are authorizied to send in
verification teams,'' said Ferreira Gomes.
   At a joint news conference Wednesday, U.S. civil rights leader
Jackson and President dos Santos stressed the importance of
Washington establishing diplomatic relations with Angola as soon as
possible.
   ``Only the United States, Israel and South Africa have not
recognized Angola since its independence from Portugal in 1975,''
said Jackson. ``It's time for the U.S. to get up to date.''
   In an interview later, he asked: ``How can we on the one hand
mediate the agreement between Angola, Cuba and South Africa, and
then on the other hand permit ourselves to arm UNITA and destabilize
the government?
   ``There should be a joint venture with the U.S. and Africa rather
than a misadventure with South Africa.''
   Jackson was ending a five-nation African tour that included
Gabon, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Zambia.

<HEAD>Aspin Calls for Overall Strategic Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee on Wednesday proposed pooling money for such strategic
weapons as Star Wars and the MX missile to force the incoming Bush
administration and Congress to make tough spending decisions.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said that under his 10-year plan, funds
for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars;
the Trident, MX and Midgetman missiles; and the B-52, B-1B and B-2
stealth bomber would be placed in a ``strategic pot.''
   The annual budget for the pot would remain constant at about $31
billion _ the total budget for the strategic programs in 1989 _ with
adjustments for inflation, Aspin said.
   The $31 billion budget would be available for all strategic
weapons, with none of it earmarked for any specific weapon, he said.
   The program would force Congress and the new administration to
decide what specific weapon systems in the pot should be purchased
and deployed and which should be delayed.
   ``It allows you to make those kind of rational tradeoffs and then
also to make the political tradeoffs,'' Aspin told a National Press
Club audience. ``The fact of the matter is you've got constituencies
for these weapon systems and you've got to finally decide what
you're going to do with them.''
   For example, Aspin mentioned continuing research and development
funding for the truck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman missile,
which many Democrats in Congress favor but the Reagan administration
proposed scrapping.
   To compensate for moving forward on the Midgetman, Aspin
suggested slowing down stealth bomber purchases for two years and
limiting spending on Star Wars to its current annual level of $4
billion through 1996.
   Aspin also suggested retiring the Poseidon ballistic missile
submarines and the oldest B-52s and using the money saved on
operating costs for the two programs for earlier deployment of the
rail-mobile version of the MX intercontinental ballistic missile,
the stealth bomber, or Star Wars.
   The committee chairman said the time has come for ``Democrats and
Republicans, White House and Congress, to put all the weapon systems
into the pot, take a long, 10-year view, work the trade-offs and
build a strategic consensus.''

<HEAD>RNC Paid Part of Quayle's Vacation Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican National Committee agreed to
pick up part of the tab for Dan Quayle's Christmas vacation in Vail,
Colo., party officials said Wednesday. But such expenses as airfare,
lodging and food were paid by the vice president-elect and his
family, his spokesman said.
   The committee issued a statement saying it had agreed to pay up
to $25,000 to cover the cost of two aides and such logistical
matters as telephone lines and a four-wheel-drive vehicle for the
skiing vacation.
   Quayle's spokesman, David Beckwith, said that an aide to the vice
president-elect, acting without authorization, had asked the
committee before the trip to cover up to $65,000 of vacation costs,
including Quayle's personal expenses.
   But Beckwith said in an interview that Quayle had considered the
request ``totally out of line.''
   Subsequently, Beckwith said, Quayle had scaled back the vacation
_ eliminating a planned charter plane, scrubbing a stopover in
Tempe, Ariz., for the Jan. 2 Fiesta Bowl, reducing the size of his
entourage and paying all his own expenses.
   ``He never asked for a specific amount,'' the spokesman said.
``The RNC came up with $25,000.''
   At the White House, President-elect Bush said he wasn't troubled
by a newspaper report of the RNC expenditures. When all the facts
come out, said Bush, ``there'll be no hue and cry.''
   RNC Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said in a statement that the
committee ``is glad it can help out the Republican vice
president-elect with what I and the budget committee consider to be
reasonable expenses.''
   The committee said in the statement that the relevant bills from
the skiing trip had not yet come in, but it was anticipated they
would total about $15,000.
   Fahrenkopf and the RNC budget committee on Dec. 15 authorized
payment of up to $25,000 in committee funds to help defray expenses
``incurred by the vice president-elect that he would not otherwise
incur as a private citizen between Dec. 15 and Jan. 20.''
   The Washington Post Wednesday quoted Fahrenkopf as calling the
original proposal ``a very large amount'' and ``not something I
thought we could do.''
   Bush, asked about the Post report, told reporters:
   ``It didn't trouble me. Wait until they get the facts and they'll
be very interesting. I think to take care of extra security
arrangements in a figure that's going to be 10 percent of the figure
that was originally stated in there _ let's wait until we get all
the facts and I think there'll be no hue and cry about that.''
   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale recalled in an interview
that in 1976, after he was elected with Jimmy Carter, he spent a
week on vacation in the Virgin Islands.
   Mondale said that he and his wife, Joan, had paid their own
expenses, but that the tab for the one aide who accompanied them
probably had been paid out of the transition budget.
   ``No way I could have paid for it,'' said the former vice
president, who had little income outside his Senate salary in 1976.
   ``One thing I'm sure of, the Democratic National Committee never
gave me $25,000,'' he added, laughing about the impoverished state
of the DNC in those days.

<HEAD>Author Says Housing Riots May Be In America's Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a book about life in a New York
City shelter said Wednesday that housing riots may be in America's
future if state and local governments don't start building
affordable homes instead of shelters.
   ``We're building the biggest permanent poorhouse in the world,''
author Jonathan Kozol said at a news conference to announce model
state legislation to alleviate homelessness.
   ``I don't know if the governors can act independently to reverse
the consequences of an 80 percent cut in federal housing funds,'' he
added. ``If they cannot, the shame of New York will soon be the
shame of a nation.''
   Kozol, author of ``Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in
America,'' said he has visited homeless shelters in 29 American
cities, including New York City's Martinique Hotel which is profiled
in the book.
   Kozol said he senses a growing militancy among homeless people,
who are beginning to organize politically.
   ``I think there's a tide of anger building up among homeless
people,'' he said.
   ``I'm afraid that we may soon see housing riots in this country.''
   Kozol praised a demonstration earlier this week by residents of
the Brooklyn Arms Hotel, another New York City homeless shelter. The
residents protested that they are to be moved into city housing
which they say is even worse than the hotel.
   New York City is slated to close its 46 homeless hotels this year
because if it doesn't, it will lose the federal money it has used to
pay the hotel bills. Last month, it closed the first _ the
Martinique, in midtown Manhattan.
   ``As New York City begins at last to renovate real housing,
however, the rest of the nation is moving in the opposite
direction,'' Kozol said. ``Instead of building housing, cities
everywhere are putting up more shelters.''
   He called homeless shelters ``the low-income housing of the
1980s,'' and complained that Cornell University's school of hotel
management is creating a course in shelter management, architects
are starting to design shelters and interior decorators are
suggesting how to furnish them.
   Maria Foscarinis, an attorney for the National Coalition for the
Homeless, presented model state legislation that her organization
has drafted to help solve the problem.
   ``Homelessness in America is a scandal, but it is not a
mystery,'' she said. ``Solutions exist; they must be implemented.''
   The model legislation proposes creating state affordable housing
trust funds to provide grants or loans to public or private entities
to develop low-income housing. It would also launch revolving funds
to provide rent or mortgage relief to people facing the loss of
their homes. The bill would provide emergency services to the
homeless, including temporary shelters, health care and job training.
   Funds for the projects would come from loan repayments and
penalties, as well as interest on real estate taxes in escrow
accounts; tenant security deposits; surtaxes on residential or
commercial sales; surcharges on building licenses and permits; the
sale of state or city property; real estate and hotel taxes; and
unclaimed property funds.
   The coalition honored Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, who was at the
news conference, because his state has already created a housing
trust fund. Perpich said Minnesota has 31 programs to move the
homeless into transitional housing.

   Afghan guerrillas said Wednesday that
1,000 Afghan government troops surrendered after heavy fighting.
Washington said the Soviets have resumed their pullout despite
deadlocked peace talks.
   Leaders of the Iran-based Afghan resistance accused the Soviet
Union, which backs the Marxist Afghan government in Kabul, of being
inflexible after talks held in Pakistan ran aground.
   The troops gave up over the weekend in Afghanistan's eastern
Nangarhar province, Fazle Akbar, director of the pro-guerrilla
Afghan Information and Documentation Center, said Wednesday.
   Akbar also said the Kama and Gushta district headquarters in the
province fell this week to the U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents, called
mujahedeen, or holy warriors. Six guerrillas were killed in the
battle for Gushta, 24 miles west of the Pakistan border, said Akbar,
who reported no other casualties.
   Soviet and Afghan jet fighters have been bombing the Kama
district headquarters, about 36 miles west of the Pakistan border
since it fell Tuesday, guerrilla sources said. Akbar said guerrillas
shot down a Soviet-made MiG 27 bomber near Kama with a U.S.-made
Stinger anti-aircraft missile.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
the Soviets were continuing the withdrawal they promised to complete
next month as part of a U.N.-mediated agreement reached last year.
   ``We continue to see evidence that the Soviets are in the process
of preparing to withdraw,'' Redman said. ``These signs include the
overland movement north of Soviet troops from the Kabul garrison in
recent days, and the closure of the Soviet military hospital in
Kabul.''
   His statement apparently was based on Western intelligence
reports, and the U.S. official declined to provide further details.
   Pakistan, which hosts more than 3 million Afghan war refugees,
has been a staunch supporter of the rebels, who have been fighting
the government in Kabul for the past 10 years.
   The Soviet Union sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistan
in 1979 to help the government battle the rebels. In April, Moscow
promised to withdraw its forces by Feb. 15. Half had left by August.
   The Kremlin's special envoy to Afghanistan Yuli Vorontsov said in
Islamabad and again in Moscow on Tuesday that the withdrawal of the
remaining 50,000 soldiers could be delayed.
   Vorontsov said guerrilla attacks on withdrawing Soviet troops
would force the soldiers to stay and fight, not withdraw. He
addressed a news conference Saturday at the end of a four-day visit
to Islamabad, where he met with Afghan guerrillas based in Pakistan
and Iran.
   The Sunni Moslem guerrilla leadership headquartered in Pakistan
promised Vorontsov the rebels would not attack withdrawing Soviet
troops.
   Vorontsov's efforts to build an agreement on a broad-based
government to move into Kabul after Feb. 15 ground to a halt Monday
when guerrillas refused to accept a coalition with the ruling
communists.
   Guerrilla leaders said the Marxist People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan has been the cause of the 10 years of war, along with
the presence of Soviet soldiers and could not be accepted now in a
postwar government.
   Leaders of the Shiite Moslem Afghan resistance based in Iran
accused the Soviet Union of being inflexible after the talks in
Pakistan.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus,
quoted Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman for the mujahedeen, at a
Wednesday news conference when he returned.
   ``In these talks the Soviets had nothing to say, and deadlocked
the talks due to their insistence that the present Kabul government
must play a role in the future Afghan government,'' Khalili was
quoted as saying.
   Khalili said no date was set for a future meeting.
   In other developments, guerrillas said they closed the road
between Pakistan and the provincial capital of Jalalabad. Akbar said
efforts to reopen the road, which is the major trade route between
Pakistan and Afghanistan, has caused heavy casualties on both sides.
   The road closing is also being blamed for food shortages in the
Afghan capital of Kabul, where Western diplomats said people are
lining up for as long as three hours for bread.

   The Constitution's ban against cruel and
inhuman punishment does not shield a retarded killer from execution
even if the defendant has the mind of a 7-year-old, the Supreme
Court was told Wednesday.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles A. Palmer of Texas urged the
justices to permit the execution of Johnny Paul Penry, 32, whose
reasoning capacity has been described as that of a child of 7.
   ``He knew what he was doing,'' Palmer said of Penry, who stabbed
to death Pamela Moseley Carpenter, 22, on Oct., 15, 1979, in
Livingston, Texas, after he raped her. Palmer recited evidence that
Penry killed the woman to prevent her from identifying him.
   Ms. Carpenter's brother, retired National Football League
placekicker Mark Moseley, was in the courtroom Wednesday.
   Moseley told reporters afterward, ``It's been nine years of hell
for myself and my family. It's not something anyone should have to
go through and I feel that if anything good can come out of it that
may be we can render a decision that will make it not happen to
someone else.''
   Curtis C. Mason, a lawyer representing Penry, spent little time
arguing that all convicted retarded murderers should be spared.
   Instead, Mason challenged the Texas death penalty law on narrower
grounds.
   Mason said the law prevented the jury, in determining what
sentence to impose, from giving full consideration to mitigating
evidence in Penry's favor.
   Penry was abused by his parents, attended school only for a few
days in the first grade and was in and out of mental hospitals while
growing up near Houston.
   ``He is not fully responsible for the way he is today,'' Mason
argued.
   But Mason said the jury in weighing punishment only was permitted
to consider whether such mitigating evidence showed that Penry had
acted ``deliberately with the reasonable expectation that death
would result.''
   While the high court might be reluctant to ban the death penalty
for all retarded killers, it still could overturn the Texas capital
punishment law on the narrower grounds cited by Mason.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose vote could be pivotal in the
case, suggested to Palmer that the Texas law gives convicted
murderers limited hope of winning a life prison term as opposed to
the death penalty.
   She questioned whether the state law allows a juror to vote for
life in prison even if the juror believed the defendant acted with
diminished moral culpability because of his background.
   Palmer replied, ``The jury can say, `My God, this boy's been
treated so badly he didn't act deliberately,''' But he acknowledged
the jury is barred from weighing such evidence to oppose the death
penalty on other grounds.
   The court, which heard 60 minutes of arguments, is expected to
announce its decision by July.
   The case has attracted considerable attention because of its
potential impact for all retarded killers.
   The Clearinghouse on Georgia Prisons and Jails, a group opposed
to capital punishment, estimates that from 12 percent to 20 percent
of the more than 2,100 inmates on death rows nationwide function at
below-average intelligence.
   Ms. Carpenter was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a scissors
she was using to make a Halloween costume for her niece. She
provided a description of her assailant before she died.
   Penry at the time was a part-time delivery man for a local
appliance store who recently had been paroled from prison, where he
was serving a sentence on a rape conviction.
   Some justices Wednesday expressed doubts that describing someone
as having the mental capacity of a child has much relevance.
   ``What does it mean to have the mental age of 9?'' asked Justice
Antonin Scalia.
   Palmer said witnesses for Penry testified he functioned mentally
like a 7-year-old and socially like a 9-year-old.
   ``Beyond that I can not help the court,'' Palmer said.
   ``If it's something we don't understand, why allow (such
evidence) to be introduced?'' asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The court also is considering this year whether the death penalty
should be banned for anyone who commits murder while under 18.

   Coca-Cola is about to be removed from the
Arab League blacklist for dealing with Israel and plans to open
bottling plants throughout the Persian Gulf, a company official said
Wednesday.
   ``We have plans to open bottling plants throughout the gulf,''
said Peter Beaumont. He would not release details on the number of
plants involved or say when they will open.
   In Syria's capital of Damascus, where the official boycott
committee met Wednesday, one participant acknowledged that the
Coca-Cola issue was discussed but refused to confirm the U.S.
conglomerate was off the blacklist.
   The boycott office, based in Damascus and an arm of the 22-nation
Arab League, put the soft drink maker on the list 21 years ago
because it did business with Israel.
   Coca-Cola bottling plants are being built in Bahrain and the
United Arab Emirates.
   Coca-Cola also is on supermarket shelves in the Sultanate of
Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. In Saudi Arabia, the latest edition of the
kingdom's official register said the company and its products were
no longer on the Arab boycott list.
   The Coke for sale in Saudi Arabia came from neighboring Oman and
was priced at $6 for a case of 24.
   Carbonated drinks are popular in the arid Gulf where the summer
temperatures soar in the vicinity of 122 degrees.
   ``I wish all our items sold as well,'' said a supermarket manager
in Riyadh, explaining that almost all of the 200 cases of Coke he
just received have sold out within a day.
   The Olayan Co. of Saudi Arabia received permission to distribute
the soft drink in a market that is dominated by Pepsi, Coke's
traditional rival.

   Israeli warplanes bombed the bases of
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal on Wednesday night in the first air
raid on Lebanon this year, police said.
   At least four fighter-bombers streaked in to bomb camps of the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council in Bkusta and Majdalyoun valley four
miles east of this southern port city, police said.
   They said the jets fired 24 rockets at the targets in three
sorties spaced over 10 minutes.
   No report of casualties was available. Police said ambulances
dispatched to the stricken bases from Sidon were turned back by Abu
Nidal's guerrillas, who told rescuers, ``We have no victims.''
   The same bases were targeted by the Israeli air force on March 23
and March 24, 1988. Police said 17 people, many of them guerrillas,
were killed and 20 wounded in both air strikes.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said the planes bombed one base
north of the port of Sidon at 9 p.m. The army did not report if the
base was destroyed but added that all the aircraft returned safely.
   The army said the raid was aimed at pre-empting attacks on Israel.
   ``The terrorist target served as a base for launching and
organizing missions,'' an army spokesman said.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council has been blamed for numerous
attacks on Israel and western European countries.
   By police count, 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in 25
Israeli air attacks on Lebanon last year.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Halting Move Toward Free Enterprise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria is moving toward free enterprise
by allowing the formation of private firms and joint-stock
companies, but the state will retain partial control over prices and
production, according to a decree published Wednesday.
   The Bulgarian State Council decree published in the state-run
media lacked specifics on the extent of continuing government
interference in private and corporate management.
   Privately owned, small companies will be allowed to employ up to
10 people by labor contract, the decree said, according to a text
from the state news agency BTA.
   Under the decree, foreigners and foreign companies may operate in
Bulgaria with or without Bulgarian participation but require
separate government approval if their share in an enterprise exceeds
49 percent.
   Conversely, all Bulgarian companies _ state-owned or privately
owned _ will be allowed to carry out ``foreign economic activity''
independently, the decree said.
   This suggested they can search for their own export markets and
buy abroad if they have hard currency at their disposal.
   While ``the main form of economic activity is the company,'' the
decree stipulates that individual citizens and groups of citizens
may perform economic activity without registering companies, BTA
reported.
   But the decree also contained a number of provisions for
continued state control.
   ``The state regulates the economic activity through a system of
taxes, duties and subsidies, currency regulations, interest
percentages, regulations for labor payment ... regulations for price
formation and state orders,'' BTA quoted the decree as saying.
   Under the decree, the government also retains a key role in
setting wages.
   In addition, the decree stipulates that ``competent
authorities,'' along with the companies concerned, stipulate
fulfillment of the state production plan ``on the basis of mutual
agreements and state orders.''
   ``State orders'' have been used in the Soviet Union to continue
central control over the economy despite new measures that are
intended to give enterprises broad autonomy.
   Bureaucrats in central Soviet planning organs simply used ``state
orders'' as a replacement for centrally ordained planning targets
that have been abandoned.

   The military filed murder charges
against an anti-communist vigilante accused of ordering the killing
of a businessman, an officer said Wednesday.
   The suspect, Jun Pala, led a group known as Contra Force that
opposed communist rebels. However, authorities say the killing was
not related to his work with the group.
   Another suspect in the businessman's slaying, Pedro Gabutan, told
police that he was one of four gunmen hired by Pala to ambush and
kill Samson Palequin Friday in Davao, about 600 miles southeast of
Manila, defense forces Maj. Rodolfo Saonoy said.
   Saonoy quoted Gabutan as saying the victim had ``some
misunderstanding'' with Pala over a business deal.
   Pala was charged Tuesday but released pending a review by a
magistrate, said defense forces Maj. Rodolfo Saonoy. Pala has said
he is innocent.
   In his radio program late Tuesday, Pala said the government had
used his followers in its anti-insurgency drive and accused it of
``ingratitude.''
   ``I can incite my men to rebel _ to go to the mountains _ but I
assure you that I have calmed them down,'' he said, addressing the
military over the local radio station DXOW.
   Pala, a radio commentator, became a national figure for his
anti-communist tirades. He was defeated in the race for mayor of
Davao in January 1987.

<HEAD>Rare Plant Species to Be Protected in Parks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A variety of rare plants and animals are toughing
it out amid the urban jungle in New York City's parks, according to
a group fighting to protect the winged monkey flower, Smartweed
dodder and other prized species.
   ``I'm sure many people will be surprised to know that unique and
endangered wildlife occurs throughout New York City,'' said J.
Martin Carovano, New York director of the Nature Conservancy.
   The Nature Conservancy, an international, nonprofit, conservation
group, on Wednesday officially teamed up with the city's Parks
Department to find and record rare species.
   New York became the first city to join private landowners around
the nation who are working to preserve rare plants and animals on
their property with the help of the Nature Conservancy's Natural
Area Registry Program.
   ``These natural jewels _ the winged monkey flower, purple
milkweed and persimmon _ are rare and endangered species and endure
despite urban pressures, such as ozone and acid deposition,'' said
Marc Matsil, director of the Park Department's Natural Resources
Group.
   ``Registering these rare flora affirms our commitment to their
protection,'' Matsil said.
   From now on, the Parks Department will take special care of an
endangered moth, known only as Amphiboea erepta ryensis, found in a
wetlands meadow near a parking lot at Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx;
a rare grassland community at LaTourette Park on Staten Island,
which also boasts purple milkweed; and 19 other plant species in
parks around the city. A rare Smartweed dodder grows in Queens.
   Other protected areas include Alley Pond and Cunningham parks in
Queens; Blue Heron Pond Park in Staten Island; Van Cortlandt Parks
in the Bronx; and Inwood Park in upper Manhattan.
   The city might not always be able to save parks from development,
Matsil said. But affiliating with the Nature Conservancy provides
``a justification to protect (the land.)''
   ``We agree in this registry to monitor and protect these
species,'' Matsil said. ``It's a lot more difficult than you think.
The recreation constituency would just as soon fill in the wetlands
for a ball field.''
   The announcement was made as representatives from about 65
conservation groups planned strategies for promoting their cause.
   ``I think the city's physical environment and natural resources
are extraordinarily important _ they are priceless,'' said city
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who discussed the dangers of
development.
   ``I think the average lay person really does not understand how
environmental issues affect our lives on a daily basis,'' said U.S.
Rep. Floyd Flake, who told the conservationists he was a recent
convert to their cause.

<HEAD>Emergency Regulations Allowed To Lapse in Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emergency regulations that were in
force in ethnically divided Sri Lanka for over 5{ years, drawing
fire from world human rights activists, lapsed at midnight Wednesday
by presidential proclamation.
   A communique issued by the Ministry of Information said, ``The
state of emergency in force for well over five years, has been
revoked with effect from midnight today (1:30 p.m. EST).''
   The emergency gave police and security forces the right to arrest
and detain people for long periods, to dispose of bodies without
inquests, to search homes without warrants and to override regular
criminal laws.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who took office on Jan. 2, had
promised to lift the emergency in an effort to chart a new and more
peaceful course for this Indian Ocean island nation, wracked by
ethnic violence since 1983.
   A military official, however, said security forces still will
have power to arrest and detain suspects without charge and to
search houses without warrants under an anti-terrorism law adopted
four years before the emergency. The official cannot be identified
under briefing rules.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, last
year issued a report alleging abuse and use of torture by Sri Lankan
security forces. The report, which included photographs of men with
badly burned bodies, contained affidavits by people who said they
were detained or experienced or witnessed torture by members of the
security forces.
   The state of emergency was extended every month since May 1983.
Premadasa vowed it would not be renewed on its next expiration date,
Jan. 15.
   On Wednesday, he told his Cabinet the emergency would be lifted
three days early, according to Information Minister and Cabinet
spokesman Festus Perera.
   Perera said the president wanted the emergency lifted quickly so
political prisoners held without charge could be freed. At least
1,800 political prisoners are still detained.
   About the time the presidential announcement was made, a small
bomb exploded in a market in the center of Colombo, injuring two
people. Police said they did not know if the bombing was related to
Sri Lanka's ethnic or political strife or stemmed from a private
dispute.
   Sri Lanka, once famed only for idyllic beaches and glittering
gemstones, exploded into ever-spiraling violence in 1983 as members
of the Tamil minority launched a separatist movement against the
Sinhalese majority.
   Since then, more than 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians,
have died in massacres, ambushes and guerrilla battles. The dead
include more than 600 Indian soldiers, part of a peacekeeping force
sent to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to try to disarm Tamil insurgents.
   In addition, more than 650 government supporters, mostly
Sinhalese, were killed by Sinhalese extremists who opposed former
President Junius R. Jayewardene's efforts to make peace with the
Tamils by granting them limited autonomy in the northern and eastern
provinces.
   Tamils, mostly Hindu, comprise about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million population. They say they are discriminated against by the
Buddhist Sinhalese majority.

<HEAD>Up To 10,000 Soviet Jews Visit Isreal In 1988 Under Glasnost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 10,000 Soviet Jews were allowed to visit
relatives in Israel last year in a wave inspired by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of more openness, a Jewish representative
said Wednesday.
   Arrivals began last spring and ``in 1988 we figure there were
between 8,000 and 10,000 who visited,'' said Rabbi Richard Hirsch,
executive director of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, a
private lobby.
   He said even more Soviet Jews could visit this year. ``We
consider this a harbinger of better times,'' said Hirsch, who
stopped in Geneva during a trip to meet with Swiss Jewish leaders.
   The Soviets, many of whom travel on plane tickets paid for by
relatives in Israel, have tourist visas and stay one to three
months, he said.
   In Israel, the Jewish Agency, a private group, has been
organizing tours of the country once the Soviets arrive in hopes
that showing Israel in a good light will promote more Russian
emigration to the Jewish state.
   Of the 20,082 Soviet Jews allowed to emigrate last year, only 7
percent chose to resettle in Israel, according to the Geneva-based
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration. The overall figure was
the highest since 1980.
   Hirsch said he expects emigration to rise to 30,000 to 40,000
this year.

<TEXT>
   A 5-month-old boy slept through the ride of his
life in the back seat of his teen-age mother's getaway car after she
robbed a bank at gunpoint to help pay family bills, authorities said
Wednesday.
   Short on cash and hard up for a baby sitter, police said Tammy L.
Richberg, 19, left young Shawn Maximillian Richberg in the car
Tuesday as she held up the First of America Bank in Zion for the
second time in two months, police said.
   Mrs. Richberg entered the bank, wielded an automatic Luger-type
BB gun, and told a teller to open the vault, where she stuffed
$32,000 into a shopping bag, police said.
   She escaped out a side door just as police, responding to a
silent alarm, entered the front door.
   Then, with the baby in a carseat sleeping in the back seat, she
led police on a chase at speeds up to 65 mph, tossing the gun and
handfuls of $50 bills ``flying like confetti'' out the car window,
said Lt. Ralph Connard of the Lake County Sheriff's Police.
   She finally smashed into a squad car at a roadblock. The toddler
was uninjured and police recovered all $32,000.
   Police in the three cars that gave chase had no idea an infant
was in the back seat, Lt. Chester Iwan said.
   ``Lo and behold, after everything was done, we find the baby,''
Iwan said.
   Mrs. Richberg was in Lake County Jail Wednesday in lieu of $1
million bond, charged with two counts of armed violence and two
counts of armed robbery, police said. A preliminary hearing is
scheduled for Jan. 23.
   The baby was handed over to juvenile authorities after the chase,
but was later returned to his distraught father.
   ``It was a very terrible day,'' said Shawn Richberg, 20, a Navy
seaman apprentice who lives in this city about 45 miles north of
Chicago. ``I'm worried and lost and just don't know where to start
or what to do.''
   Mrs. Richberg told police she robbed the same bank of $10,000 on
Dec. 1 to pay credit card bills, Connard said. Police said she also
had been charged with a felony theft in November because of
allegations of stealing from her former employer.
   Richberg said he didn't know about the Dec. 1 bank robbery or the
charges against his wife in November until authorities told him. And
he said he and his wife had no unusual financial problems.
   ``We were in the same situation as just about everybody else,''
he said.

<HEAD>Navy Ships Move Away From Libya</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will rotate two aircraft
carrier battle groups well away from Libya and also has canceled
plans for a missile-firing exercise in the nearby central
Mediterranean Sea, defense sources said Wednesday.
   ``There's no sense being accused of baiting the rattlesnake,''
said one official, referring to the enigmatic Libyan strongman, Col.
Moammar Gadhafi.
   The moves were described within the Pentagon as trying to lower
tensions between the United States and Libya, a week after two Navy
jets shot down two Libyan MiG-23's. Tensions between the two
countries already were high after Washington threatened to attack an
alleged chemical weapons factory near Tripoli.
   The United States has said the two F-14 fighters were far away
from Libya and acted in self-defense when they were approached by
the MiG's over the Mediterranean in a ``hostile manner.''
   The defense officials, who declined to be identified, said
Wednesday the Navy battle group led by the carrier USS John F.
Kennedy _ from which the F-14's flew _ would complete its six-month
deployment and be replaced by the carrier Theodore Roosevelt
starting late this week in the Tyrrhenian Sea _ off the west coast
of Italy.
   The Roosevelt battle group passed through the Strait of Gibraltar
and entered the Mediterranean on Wednesday.
   The sources said it was routine for two carrier groups to operate
together during a brief overlap period to accomplish a rotation
``and nothing will be different here.''
   ``We will have two battle groups together for two or three days,
starting around Saturday in the Tyrrhenian Sea,'' said one Navy
official. ``And they will perform joint operations there.
   ``Then the Kennedy heads west and home and the Teddy Roosevelt
east on patrol and routine operations.''
   The sources said there had been one change in plans, however,
involving the two carriers.
   After the rotation, the Navy had planned a routine missile-firing
exercise in the central Mediterranean, north of Libya, on Jan. 16
and 17, the sources explained.
   As a routine precaution, the Navy had issued a ``Notice to
Airman'' and filed it with air traffic controllers in Tripoli, who
have responsibility for that so-called Flight Information Region.
   On Tuesday, Libya's ambassador to the U.N., Ali A. Treiki,
disclosed the plns and branded them provocative.
   Wednesday, Herbert S. Okun, the second-ranking U.S. ambassador,
told reporters the ``Notice to Airman'' had been cancelled. Another
U.S. Mission officer, John Kriendler, added the whole maneuver had
been called off.
   Neither man elaborated on when the exercise had been canceled, or
the reason for the change in plans.
   ``But it would seem logical that we're trying to ease the
tensions a bit,'' observed one Pentagon official. ``It's not our
intention to press things with Libya right now.''
   The sources said the missile-firing exercise was to have involved
some routine practice with surface-to-air missiles and not any
air-to-ground missiles of the type that would be used in any attack
on Libya.
   ``Our (carrier) rotation is not going to threaten Libya and now
we've canceled the exercise,'' added one source. ``If anything else
is going to happen out there, it will be because Gadhafi once again
started it.''

<HEAD>Bradley Files for Fifth Term as LA Mayor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley launched his campaign for an
unprecedented fifth term Wednesday, the first candidate to file in a
field that was thinned by the unexpected withdrawal of his strongest
potential challenger.
   The 71-year-old Democrat was first in line when the city clerk's
office opened Wednesday, the first day candidates could declare
their intent to run in the April 11 election.
   ``I'm looking forward to a very active campaign. I won't overlook
anyone or anything in the city,'' Bradley promised. ``Anyone else
who gets in this race faces an uphill battle.''
   Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a liberal Democrat who blames Bradley
for allowing overly rapid growth in the nation's second-largest
city, planned to challenge him in the non-partisan race. But
Yaroslavsky unexpectedly took himself out of contention Thursday.
   Citing a poll and the advice of friends, Yaroslavsky said Bradley
has such a rapport with the public that voters don't blame him for
gang violence, traffic, smog and other problems plaguing Los Angeles.
   Another Democratic councilman, Nate Holden, said this week he was
considering a bid if he can raise $400,000 in contributions by noon
Saturday, the close of the filing period. He said he has already
raised $75,000. Bradley has $2 million in his campaign chest.
   Holden alleged that Bradley, who is black, has broken faith with
the black voters who, in alliance with wealthier Jewish voters, form
the core of his support. Holden called the race ``winnable.''
   Bradley, a former police lieutenant and City Council member, won
his first four-year term as mayor in 1973 but has been unable to
project his popularity statewide. He twice ran for governor, losing
to George Deukmejian in 1982 and 1986.
   Joel Britton, who identified himself as a process operator for
Chevron oil, also filed for the mayor's race Wednesday. He said he
was running because more attention needs to be paid to business
interests. Britton did not identify his political party.

<HEAD>Contras Announce Peace Proposal With More Flexible Compliance Calender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Nicaraguan Contras, boasting a
revised peace proposal and a more flexible attitude, urged the
Sandinistas on Wednesday to begin another round of peace talks.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance, an umbrella group of the rebels, has
proposed opening negotiations with the Sandinistas on Jan. 25 or
some other date agreed upon in Washington.
   But so far there has been no official response from the
Nicaraguan government, according to Adolfo Calero, a director of the
Resistance.
   ``We are being more flexible in this new position,'' Calero said
Wednesday in a news conference at the group's Miami headquarters.
   A major element of the Contras' revised position is to extend the
deadline for compliance by the Sandinistas from 70 days to 120 days,
culminating in the rebels giving up their arms and being
reintegrated into the political and social fabric of Nicaragua.
   ``The Sandinistas have made promise after promise and never
comply,'' said another Contra leader, Wilfredo Montalvan. ``If the
Sandinistas maintain their intransigence, the world will take notice
that they have no desire to implement democratization and we would
have no choice but to seek more military aid.''
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced in his year-end
speech in Managua that he would unilaterally extend a cease-fire for
another month and that Nicaragua was ready to ``look for ways to
coexist with the enemies of the revolution.'' But he rejected peace
talks with the Contras.
   Although both sides agreed in March to end offensive operations,
there has been no progress to resolve the 7-year-old conflict.
Thousands of rebels remain at bases along the Honduran border with
Nicaragua.
   Calero said the latest Contra proposal will be sent to Central
American presidents and foreign ministers, who can perhaps pressure
the Sandinistas to agree to peace talks with the rebels.
   Another element of the Contra proposal was to seek an independent
judiciary, with professionals to be ``named in accordance to their
capacity,'' rather than demand the outright removal of current
Supreme Court justices, Calero said. Calero did not elaborate
further on the revised proposal, nor was a copy of it provided to
reporters.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance also denounced the assassination last
week of Commander ``Aureliano,'' a guerrilla physician killed last
week on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
   ``It's nothing but another step of the Sandinista plan to
decimate the political and military direction of the Resistance,''
Calero said.
   Calero said the killing of the doctor, Adan Rugama Acevedo, was
not an isolated incident. He referred to other incidents, including
the murder two weeks ago of a guard at the home of Contra leader
Enrique Bermudez in Tegucigalpa, the attempted murder of Commander
``Douglas'' last November and a recent bombing at the home of
another anti-Sandinista.
   Montalvan said the rebels are encouraged by the election of
Carlos Andres Perez as president of Venezuela. He said Resistance
director Alfredo Cesar left Tuesday to meet with Perez for
discussions about the future of Nicaragua.
   Asked about the flood of Nicaraguan refugees entering the United
States, with some 100,000 to 125,000 in the Miami area, Calero said
the Resistance has asked U.S. officials to treat the refugees
humanely and not deport them.

   The AFL-CIO on Wednesday endorsed Washington
attorney Ronald H. Brown to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr. as chairman of
the Democratic National Committee despite public support by building
trades unions for another candidate.
   The nation's largest labor organization announced the endorsement
in two-sentence statement issued after a 90-minute meeting between
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and the 16 other members of its
national political committee.
   The statement said the AFL-CIO ``will be urging members of the
DNC to vote for Brown.'' It did not say why he was selected.
   Of the 404 votes on the DNC, 46 are cast by union
representatives. But labor's influence is considered far greater
than those numbers suggest. All five candidates to succeed Kirk met
with labor leaders last week in hopes of securing the endorsement.
   Brown and Richard Weiner, the Michigan state party chairman, are
viewed as the front-runners to replace Kirk. Brown has the support
of many national Democrats but few if any of them vote and Weiner is
believed to have a considerable base among state party chairmen
because he heads their organization.
   The other candidates are former Reps. Jim Jones of Oklahoma,
Michael Barnes of Maryland and James V. Stanton of Ohio.
   All five last week began a series of joint regional meetings
around the country.
   The DNC will pick a successor to Kirk next month.
   The AFL-CIO statement said the Brown endorsement resulted from a
``consensus'' reached during Wednesday's meeting. The organization
generally uses the word ``unanimous'' to describe its endorsements
but building trades unions affilated with AFL-CIO have previously
made public endorsements of Stanton.
   Brown is a longtime party activist who most recently advised the
unsuccessful presidential campaign of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis.
   Critics of his candidacy argue that his election would signal the
party is lining up behind the liberal stands of Jesse Jackson. Brown
was a top Jackson adviser before joining the Dukakis campaign.

   Honduran President Jose Azcona called on the
Nicaraguan government Wednesday to create conditions for the return
of the thousands of Contra rebels who are camped inside Honduran
territory.
   If the Sandinista government establishes a free system, the
Contras will be able to return and ``fight in the political arena
and not in the purely military arena,'' Azcona told a news
conference.
   Azcona ended a two-day visit here in which he paid a farewell
call on President Reagan and also met with President-elect Bush and
Secretary of State-designate James Baker III.
   Azcona gave few clues as to the course Bush expects to follow on
Central America after his inauguration. He said he asked Bush to
find a solution to the Contra problem ``as quickly as possible.''
   But, he said, the principal responsibility for the return of the
Contras to Nicaragua rests with the Sandinista government.
   Asked whether Bush outlined his views on renewed aid to the
Contras, Azcona said that issue received only peripheral treatment
in their discussion. No military aid has been sent to the rebels
since a congressional aid cutoff went into effect last February.
   In his public statements, Bush has been non-committal on the
policy he will follow on Central America.
   He has yet to name his selection for assistant secretary of state
for Latin America, considered one of the State Department's most
difficult jobs because of the continuing turmoil in Central America
and the foreign debt crisis that afflicts many hemispheric countries.
   One contender for the post is Robert Helander, a New York lawyer
with long experience in South America, including business
connections with the Rockefeller family.
   According to State Department officials, congressional staff
members with whom Helander has spoken in recent days have made it
clear they hope Bush will choose someone else from among the long
list of candidates for the post.
   As of late last week, transition team officials said no decision
had been made. The outgoing assistant secretary, Elliott Abrams,
plans to accept a temporary assignment after Jan. 20 with the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group.
   At present, there is a stalemate in Central America, with
U.S.-donated food and other humanitarian assistance sustaining the
thousands of rebels and their families who fled Nicaragua to camps
in the border area last year after an interim cease-fire was signed
between the Sandinistas and the Contras.
   In Miami on Wednesday, Contra leaders unveiled a revised
settlement plan and called on the Sandinista government to resume
peace talks, which have been suspended for seven months.
   A major element of the revised position is to extend the deadline
for compliance by the Sandinistas from 70 days to 120 days,
culminating in the rebels giving up their arms and being
reintegrated into the political and social fabric of Nicaragua.
   ``We are being more flexible in this new position,'' Contra
leader Adolfo Calero said at a news conference.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has said his government is
prepared to look for ways ``to coexist with enemies of the
revolution'' but rejected new talks with the Contras.
   Honduran officials have been concerned that unless the refugee
issue is resolved, the Contras and their families, with no other
place to go, may be forced to settle permanently in Honduras,
contributing to the country's already severe social and economic
problems.
   According to some estimates, there are about 10,000 rebels in the
border area, along with 15,000 family members.
   There has been little visible international support for a
Honduran call last fall for the formation of an international force
to evict the rebels from Honduras.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias battled
with artillery and rockets in the southern mountains Wednesday, and
pro-Syrian fighters massed for an assault on fundamentalists in a
strategic stronghold.
   Also Wednesday, Israeli jets bombed bases of the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the radical Moslem group led by Abu
Nidal, in the outskirts of the southern port city of Sidon, police
said.
   As fighting between mainstream Amal militiamen and their cornered
Iranian-backed enemies raged for the fourth day, police reported 12
Amal fighters were killed in abortive overnight attacks on Jbaa.
   The village, 10 miles southeast of Sidon, is the key to a
triangular bastion where 500 Hezbollah fighters are under siege just
northwest of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   ``We'll attack again and again until we uproot those traitors
from Jbaa and the rest of south Lebanon,'' said an Amal commander in
the hamlet of Kfar Filla, who gave only his nom de guerre of Abu Ali.
   It will be no easy victory, he said.
   ``Jbaa is like an eagle's nest. It's difficult to climb the
slopes to reach it and push the Hezbollahis out.''
   An Amal communique said its militiamen seized an underground
Hezbollah arms depot in the village of Ma'roub, 13 miles east of the
southern port of Tyre.
   The communique said 350 Soviet-designed grad rockets, 150 AK-47
assault rifles and two million rounds of ammunition were confiscated.
   Police in Tyre said they could not confirm the claim.
   Police reported eight people wounded have died in the hospital,
raising the casualty toll since Sunday to 107 killed and more than
220 wounded.
   It is the fourth major confrontation between Shiite factions
since April, when rivalry to dominate Lebanon's 1 million Shiites
exploded into warfare. Some 500 people have been killed and 1,500
wounded since then.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries from the Israeli air
raid, the first this year. Police said Abu Nidal's guerrillas turned
away ambulances, saying they had no casualties.
   A police spokesman said 1,000 Amal fighters were regrouping with
their Syrian-supplied T-54 battle tanks, multibarreled rocket
launchers and howitzers for a major three-pronged offensive
Wednesday. Hezbollah repulsed four overnight assaults on Jbaa, said
the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   Amal on Monday cut Hezbollah's supply lines to its
nine-square-mile stronghold, which stretches southeast from Jbaa to
nearby hamlets of Ein Bouswar and Louwaizeh and the wooded slopes of
Mount Safi. At the same time, they recaptured four of five villages
taken by Hezbollah in fighting that police described as ``horrific.''
   They say both sides have committed terrible atrocities, with
Hezbollah fighters hacking off heads and limbs of captured Amal men.
   Shiite housewife Zainab Khater choked back tears Wednesday as she
described watching Hezbollah fighters kill a teacher on Sunday in
Kfar Filla, 1 mile west of Jbaa.
   ``They shot one of the students in the legs and when the teacher
rushed to help him, a Hezbollahi chopped off the teacher's head with
a cutlass,'' she cried.
   Abu Ali said the fighting has changed the future for Shiites.
   ``Life will neve be as it used to be,'' he told reporters. ``The
Hezbollahis and us used to live together in the same villages before
this broke out. We'll never be able to coexist.''
   Hezbollah seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Lebanon. The more secular Amal prefers a multisect government with
Moslems and Christians sharing power.
   The southern fighting raged despite efforts by Syrian President
Hafez Assad and Iran's first deputy foreign minister, Ali Mohammad
Besharati, who met Tuesday to discuss how to end the bloodshed.
   Beirut's pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq daily said they agreed to continue
their efforts.
   An Iranian Embassy source in the Syrian capital, Damascus, said
Assad had asserted a cease-fire could be achieved only by
coordination between Syria and Iran.
   He denied reports that Besharati was going to Beirut to mediate,
a suggestion Amal has rejected.
   Amal drove Hezbollah out of most of the south in a four-day
battle in April. A month later, Hezbollah ousted Amal from most of
south Beirut in a three-week war.
   Syria deployed troops in south Beirut to quell the fighting. But
violence erupted again in November.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains about 40,000
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as Moslem sectors
of Beirut.

   The Communist Party leadership of
Montenegro resigned Wednesday along with the southern republic's
collective presidency, a move demanded tens of thousands of people
in two days of protests.
   About 60,000 filled the streets of Titograd, the provincial
capital, Tuesday and 50,000 protested on Wednesday. The outcry
stemmed from continuing economic crisis in one of Yugoslavia's
poorest republics.
   ``The disposition of the workers is clear: to uphold all demands
for changes,'' Titograd television said in a live broadcast.
   Miljan Radovic, head of the Montenegrin party's ruling Presidium,
said: ``The dramatic economic situation has culminated in mass
political dissatisfaction,''
   Montenegro's government resigned last October during similar
protests, which police eventually dispersed with force, but party
leaders refused to step down.
   News of the resignations was wildly cheered by protesters who
chanted outside Parliament: ``Down with armchair leaders!'' ``Down
with scoundrels!'' and ``We want free elections!'' The crowd began
to disperse after the announcement.
   Montenegro, on the southern Adriatic coast, is Yugoslavia's
smallest republic and has a population of about 550,000.
   The average monthly wage has declined to the equivalent of $80,
and 10,000 workers have lost their jobs in shutdowns of industries
that were losing money.
   Wednesday's mass resignation was the first since the party
leadership of Vojvodina province stepped down after demonstrations
last October, a week before the Monetenegrin government resigned.
   On Dec. 20, the central government resigned because of the annual
inflation rate of 250 percent, high unemployment and other economic
problems. It was the first resignation of a national government
since the Communist Party under the late President Tito gained power
after World War II.

   Roger B. Porter, a Harvard University professor
and former presidential aide, was named George Bush's chief domestic
policy adviser on Wednesday.
   Porter, 42, was a White House adviser in President Reagan's first
term and also worked as an assistant to former President Ford. He is
currently a professor of business and government at Harvard.
   He was among a group of new White House staff selections
announced by Bush's incoming chief of staff, John Sununu.
   Other announcements included:
   _ Stephen M. Studdert, a former Bush campaign aide who now is
director of Bush's inaugural committee, as assistant to the
president for special activities and initiatives.
   _ Richard Breeden, a Washington lawyer and former vice
presidential aide, as assistant for issues analysis.
   _ John P. Schmitz as deputy counsel, the same job he has held in
Bush's vice presidential office.
   _ B. Jay Cooper, Stephen Hart and Alixe Reed Glen, as deputy
press secretaries. Cooper is currently a deputy press secretary in
the Reagan White House, while Hart is Bush's vice presidential
spokesman and Ms. Glen serves in a similar capacity in Bush's

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
on Wednesday released 38 federal properties for use by state and
local governments and non-profit organizations to provide shelters
for the homeless.
   The agency's action came in response to a Dec. 14 order issued by
U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch, who ordered HUD to review more
than 300 properties in the General Services Administration inventory
to determine their suitability for use by the homeless.
   The list of 17 buildings and 21 land sites determined suitable by
the agency includes property in 23 states and Puerto Rico.
   ``Today's action brings to 148 the number of properties (65
buildings and 83 land sites) in GSA's inventory that HUD had judged
suitable,'' and completes the agency's review, HUD said.
   HUD had said earlier that 110 other GSA properties met its
minimum requirements for physical structure, available utilities and
accessibility by road.
   State and local governments and non-profit groups may submit
applications to use the properties to GSA and the Department of
Health and Human Services which will oversee the process by which
the properties are made available.
   ``It's a grudging and very small step by HUD to implement the
federal statute and I think that there's an enormous potential under
the law,'' said Maria Foscanis, counsel to the National Coalition
for the Homeless. ``The federal government is a major property
holder and given a good-faith effort a lot more can be done,'' she
added.
   HUD said it is also reviewing more than 1600 other properties
owned by federal agencies in accordance with a 1987 law. The agency
said that review would be completed by the end of February.

<HEAD>Fed Proposed Tightening Disclosure Requirements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday proposed
new rules requiring lenders to provide home equity loan borrowers
with more information about the cost of such loans.
   In general, lenders would have to provide potential borrowers
with a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the loan
at the time of loan application and before any non-refundable fee is
collected.
   For applications taken over the telephone, lenders would have
three days to supply the required information.
   The disclosures must include a full explanation of how the
interest rate and monthly payments might change and the
circumstances under which immediate repayment of the loan could be
demanded.
   Congress has prohibited lenders from unilaterally changing the
terms of the loan after it has been taken out. The Federal Reserve
is proposing to allow changes, such as providing a lower monthly
payment over a longer term, provided the borrower agrees to the
changes in writing.
   Lenders offering variable-rate loans would be forbidden to base
the rate on an index that is under their control, such as the bank's
own prime rate. The Fed said about 26 percent of home equity lenders
would be affected by this provision.
   The board is allowing 60 days for public comment on the rules,
which are required by legislation that Congress enacted in November.
The Fed had been working on a rule since December 1987, but held off
on enacting it while Congress debated the legislation.
   Home equity loans have mushroomed in popularity since passage of
the 1986 tax act, which phased out the deductibility of interest on
most consumer loans, except loans secured by homes.
   According to the Federal Reserve staff, about 5.7 percent of all
homeowners, roughly 3.3 million families, have home equity loan
accounts totaling more than $50 billion.
   The staff said consumers have used the loans conservatively. It
said about 0.75 percent of the borrowers were behind in their
payments, compared with a delinquency rate three to four times
higher for other kinds of consumer borrowing, such as auto loans,
credit cards and personal loans.
   Consumer advocates have been wary of the loans, even though they
often have lower rates, because borrowers can lose their homes if
they can't repay.

   Parliament passed two historic laws Wednesday giving Hungarian
citizens the rights to demonstrate and form associations, including
independent political parties. The legislature also, however, passed
a measure banning demonstrations outside Parliament.
   The new law grants parties and movements only the right to exist.
A separate law to be passed later this year will regulate the
registration and operation of political parties. Until it is passed,
independent political groups cannot enter candidates in
parliamentary or local council elections.

   Communist Party leaders in Montenegro, one of Yugoslavia's
component republics, offered to resign Wednesday in the face of
protests by tens of thousands of people demanding that they step
down because they have not reversed the republic's economic slide.
The government _ but not party leaders _ resigned in October during
similar protests.
   The political turmoil in Montenegro follows nationwide protests
last year that toppled some regional and national leaders.
   In the republic of Slovenia Wednesday, a group announced
establishment of the Slovenian Democratic Union, the first
independent political group to be set up in Yugoslavia.
   Yugoslavia has Europe's highest inflation of about 250 percent a
year, large-scale unemployment and increasing labor and social
unrest.

   A decree published Wednesday indicates Bulgaria is moving toward
free enterprise by allowing formation of private firms and
joint-stock companies, but the state will retain partial control
over prices and production.
   The Bulgarian State Council decree lacked specifics on the extent
of continuing government interference, but said privately owned
companies will be allowed to employ up to 10 people by labor
contract.
   Bulgarian companies will be allowed to carry out independent
``foreign economic activity,'' and foreign companies may operate in
Bulgaria, but require government approval if their share in an
enterprise exceeds 49 percent.
   The decree also contained provisions for continued state control
over such enterprises through taxation, duties, subsidies, currency
regulations, and wage and price controls.

   Sunday's rally intends to commemorate the suicide of student Jan

himself to protest the Soviet-led invasion a year earlier that
quashed a broad-based reform movement supported by then-Communist
leader Alexander Dubcek.

   The government said Tuesday it opposes legalizing a group of
independent journalists who reject the government-backed

crackdown.
   Governmant spokesman Jerzy Urban said the government especially
opposes legalizing the group because its leaders ``collaborate with
Radio Free Europe'' _ the U.S.-financed radio station that
broadcasts uncensored news to Eastern Europe.
   A Communist Party plenum to consider the stance toward the banned
trade union Solidarity will begin next week.

   The government initiated deportation
proceedings Wednesday against an Ohio man it alleges was a Nazi
guard who helped torture and kill Jews at the Auschwitz death camp
during World War II .
   An order to show cause why Johann Dorth, 64, should not be
deported was filed in U.S. Immigration Court by the Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigations.
   The Nazi-hunting unit, which has obtained the deportation of 24
former Nazis for persecutions committed during the Holocaust,
charged that Dorth was a member of the Waffen-SS Death's Head units
from 1942 to 1944.
   The units, which guarded concentration camps set up by Nazi
Germany to kill six million Jews, were adjudged to be criminal
organizations by the Nuremberg war-crimes tribunal in 1946.
   The Justice Department charged that Dorth participated in the
torture and murder of Jewish prisoners while he served as a Death's
Head guard at Auschwitz.
   OSI charged that Dorth, a native of Yugoslavia, concealed his SS
service when he entered the United States from Austria in 1951.
Dorth was admitted on a visa granted under the Displaced Persons
Act, the department said.
   Under immigration law, authorities can seek deportation for
persons who concealed their identity as members of criminal
organizations when they were admitted to this country.
   Such individuals have the burden of proving in immigration court
why they should be allowed to stay in the United States.
   Dorth, who lives in Fairfield, Ohio, never applied for U.S.
citizenship, the department said.

   The Vietnamese government has told the United
States it will return the suspected remains of 25 Americans killed
in the Vietnam War and also let five U.S. teams of experts in the
country for a search mission, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   The repatriation of the 25 remains will occur Jan. 23, with an
American cargo plane flying to Hanoi and transporting the remains to
the U.S. Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu,
Hawaii, the Pentagon said.
   Prior to that, starting Jan. 14, ``five teams of U.S. technical
experts will arrive in Hanoi to work with Vietnamese counterparts
during the fourth 10-day joint mission to investigate and survey
incidents involving Americans missing in Vietnam,'' the Pentagon
said.
   ``The U.S. government is pleased that Vietnam has agreed'' to
allow five American teams in the country instead of the four teams
allowed on previous missions, the Pentagon added.
   ``The U.S. delegation will be composed of two investigation
teams, two excavation teams and a forensic team. They will be joined
by counterparts from the Vietnamese Office for Seeking Missing
Persons.''
   The announcement of the repatriation comes less than a month
after Vietnam transferred the largest single group of remains ever
to the United States since the war's end _ 38 individuals.
   The largest previous repatriation, which occurred in April 1988,
totaled 27 individuals.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans continue to be listed as missing in
Indochina as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,747 are listed
as missing in either North or South Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 172 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
Army lab since the end of the war.
   The Pentagon, in its statement Wednesday, noted the upcoming
repatriation would be the eighth since a special presidential
mission was undertaken by retired Gen. John Vessey. The retired Army
general went to Vietnam at President Reagan's request in August 1987
with orders to seek greater cooperation with the Vietnamese in
resolving the cases of missing Americans.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative taken by Vietnam
to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing
joint cooperation to resolve this long-standing humanitarian
issue,'' the Pentagon said.
   In the past, remains repatriated by Vietnam have occasionally
included those of Vietnamese individuals. As a result, the Pentagon
routinely declines to predict whether all repatriated remains can be
individually identified by the Army laboratory in Honolulu.

   The chairman and ranking Republican of the
Senate Banking Committee want the Treasury Department and federal
regulators to conduct a sweeping study of leveraged buyouts by Feb.
1.
   Among other things, Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Jake
Garn, R-Utah, asked for an analysis of:
   _the potential strength, during an economic downturn, of major
leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, completed in the last five years.
   _possible management conflicts of interest in the transactions.
   _whether existing bondholders were treated fairly.
   _and, whether pension funds and banks are in any danger from
providing loans for the deals.
   In an LBO, an investment group borrows heavily in order to buy
out stockholders and take over the company. Often LBOs are proposed
by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover.
   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell of pieces of
the company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear the high
debt levels, in a recession, would endanger both the bought-out
company and the banks and firms financing the buyout.
   The two senators, in a letter dated Jan. 6 but released
Wednesday, asked for the information from the Treasury Department,
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and
other bank regulators.
   The senators also asked for any recommendations on whether and
how to curb LBOs.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, under Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., last month revealed that it had launched an examination of
the biggest-ever LBO, the $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.

<HEAD>PLO Wins Symbolic Recognition As Palestine Before Security Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO won a diplomatic victory Wednesday
when the Security Council granted it the right to speak directly to
the council as ``Palestine,'' on the same basis as any U.N. member
nation.
   The United States was the only nation to vote against the move.
Britain, Canada and France abstained, while the Soviet Union, China,
Finland, Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, Algeria, Ethiopia, Nepal,
Senegal and Yugoslavia voted in favor.
   In the past, the Palestine Liberation Organization had to ask
another nation to sponsor its right to speak to the council.
Organizations must be invited to speak; member states may directly
ask to address the council.
   The Palestinian delegates will be addressed as ``Palestine,'' as
they are in the General Assembly, rather than under their former
title as the observer mission of the PLO.
   The PLO's diplomatic victory came as it pursued the right to
speak before the council on the U.S. Navy's downing of two Libyan
military planes last week.
   Acceptance of the PLO's bid to address the council directly as
``Palestine'' gave symbolic weight to its claim to represent a
nation, but not formal recognition. The Security Council would have
to vote to formally admit Palestine as a member state.
   ``The United States, consequently, opposes extending to the PLO
the same rights to participate in the proceedings of the Security
Council as if that organization represented a member state of the
United Nations,'' said Herbert S. Okun, the second-ranking U.S.
ambassador.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
proclaimed an independent Palestinian state in November. The PLO
says more than 90 countries have recognized that state.
   The parliament did not specify the boundaries of the state, but
it roughly encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
with Jerusalem as its declared capital.
   In December, the General Assembly passed a resolution elevating
the PLO's status as an organization with observer status to become
the Palestine Observer Mission, a non-voting member.
   The United States and Israel voted against the resolution, and 44
nations abstained, including the rest of the Western bloc.
   The elevation in status put ``Palestine'' in a class with the
Vatican, North Korea, South Korea, Monaco, San Marino and
Switzerland as non-member states with permanent observer missions.
   Western nations contended that the state proclaimed by the PLO
lacks the normal attributes of a nation, such as a functioning
goverment in control of territory and a population within defined
borders.
   One of the General Assembly's committees also voted in December
to let the PLO address the General Assembly directly instead of
through intermediaries, the right which it now seeks from the
Security Council.
   On simple procedural matters such as on the PLO's right to speak,
the five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ do not have veto power.
They can veto substantial political resolutions. The other members
are non-permanent.

   A judge Wednesday extended for three
weeks the period in which Central American asylum-seekers can leave
southern Texas, where an immigration policy was blamed for trapping
hundreds in desperate conditions.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela postponed until Jan. 31 a
hearing in a lawsuit filed last week against the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   The hearing had been scheduled for Thursday, when a temporary
restraining order against the INS policy was to expire.
   The order issued Monday restored the right for asylum-seekers to
travel to U.S. destinations while their cases are resolved, a right
they will retain until the rescheduled hearing.
   The order inspired an exodus of hundreds of Central Americans
from the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
   ``It's something fine for us, because we can go be with our
families and here in the valley we don't have anybody,'' said Ana
Rodriguez, a 23-year-old Honduran headed for Austin, where she has
relatives.
   The Dec. 16 INS policy under fire required asylum-seekers to stay
close to the application center nearest their point of entry while
their requests are considered. Many Central Americans enter the
United States in southern Texas and file their requests at the busy
center in Harlingen.
   The policy left Rodriguez and other aliens unable to leave the
area, where they resorted to living in primitive camps, abandoned
buildings and church shelters.
   Many rushed to leave after the judge's order and swamped the INS
office in Harlingen to make sure their application papers would be
processed by Thursday.
   ``Now we can go and be a little more tranquil about when we
leave,'' Jose Narvaez Romero, 34, of Nicaragua, said Wednesday after
learning about the postponement.
   Narvaez said his papers were ready for his trip to a cousin's
home in Hollywood, Calif., but he lacked the $79 bus fare. He
planned to wait until his cousin could wire him money on Friday.
   He and about 150 other Central Americans slept outside the INS
office in Harlingen to be among the first in line Wednesday morning.
Crude tents of plastic sheeting were stretched between palm trees in
a nearby field, and the INS provided portable toilets.
   Virginia Kice, an INS spokeswoman in Harlingen, said the office
on Tuesday processed 967 political asylum applications, a one-day
record, and was almost as busy Wednesday.
   She said the agency had asked for the legal extension to prepare
its case. ``We will be ready to go,'' by Jan. 31, she said. ``And we
are going to fight it all the way.''
   ``I'd say about 95 percent of these people are here for jobs, not
political asylum,'' Ms. Kice said. ``Just talking with them on a
superficial basis, that's what they say. They are here for economic
reasons.''
   Mark Schneider, an attorney with the Harlingen-based Projecto
Libertad legal office and a co-counsel to the class-action lawsuit
against the INS, said the asylum-seekers are ready for trial but
welcome the extended travel time.
   ``This should remedy the huge backlog of thousands of people
stuck in the valley, so I think we'll see a lot less of the hardship
and the crisis that we've seen in the past three weeks,'' Schneider
said.
   Greyhound Lines reported its northbound passenger loads more than
doubled on Tuesday.
   On one extra, unscheduled bus added Tuesday evening, ``the whole
busload was going to Miami,'' said George Gravley, a Greyhound
spokesman in Dallas.
   He said the rush appeared to be dying down by late Wednesday
morning.
   Those remaining in Harlingen and Brownsville, Texas' southernmost
city on the Mexican border, continued to receive food and clothing
donations.
   ``Whether you agree with everything that's been happening, or if
they're illegals, they're still hungry,'' said Bob Bush, who with
members of Harlingen's First Assembly of God dished out beans and
tortillas to Central Americans gathered at the INS Harlingen office.

<HEAD>Idaho Seeks to Extradite Couple Charged With Abandoning Son at Rest
Stop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Extradition proceedings have begun against
a Utah couple accused of abandoning their mentally retarded
7-year-old son at a highway rest stop, Idaho officials said
Wednesday.
   The boy's parents, Edward Donald Tuinman, 29, and his wife,
Deborah, 28, were arrested after a 5-year-old Utah boy recognized a
televised picture of the abandoned child as a former neighbor and
his mother contacted officials.
   The Tuinmans were being held in Salt Lake County Jail on Idaho
charges of felony abandonment of a child.
   The boy, Eddy, was found Jan. 4 by a truck driver at a rest stop
on Interstate 84 east of Boise, Idaho. He wore only a T-shirt and
authorities said a medical examination revealed bruises, cigarette
burns and healed fractures.
   Doctors said the boy, who weighed 44 pounds, was developmentally
disabled and unable to speak.
   Prosecutors in Ada County, Idaho, said they have begun drafting
documents needed for Gov. Cecil Andrus to issue a warrant asking
Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter to return the Tuinmans to the state.
   Also Wednesday, officials in Yakima, Wash., said they have begun
their own investigation into the couple. The Tuinmans are believed
to have lived in Yakima for the last three months of 1988, said
Yakima County Sheriff's Lt. Jerry Hafsos.
   Authorities in Salt Lake City and Yakima are investigating the
possibility the boy was abused in their jurisdiction.
   The Tuinmans were arraigned Tuesday on fugitive warrants and
charges alleging theft of services in the Salt Lake suburb of Sandy.
A Feb. 10 hearing was scheduled.
   In Idaho, Deputy County Prosecutor Jay Rosenthal said he expected
Idaho's felony abandonment charges to take precedence over the Utah
charges.
   He said he would complete the extradition documents after
receiving reports from law enforcement agencies and the Boise,
Idaho, hospital where Eddy was treated before being turned over to
foster parents Sunday.
   Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney Bud Ellett said the Tuinmans,
arrested in Nephi on Saturday, had not decided whether to fight
extradition.
   In another development, The Salt Lake Tribune quoted unidentified
investigators as saying Mrs. Tuinman told them she was sleeping when
the boy was dropped off and that she was told he was left with Idaho
social services.
   The Tuinmans' other children, an 11-month-old boy, a 6-year-old
boy and an 11-year-old girl, were examined at a Nephi hospital,
where doctors found no signs of neglect. They were in protective
custody in Utah.
   At a juvenile court hearing Monday in Salt Lake City, the
children's grandparents requested custody of the children.

<HEAD>Bonn Defense Chief Says Short-Range Nuclear Missiles To Be Replaced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said
Wednesday that aging, U.S. short-range nuclear missiles in West
Germany will have to be replaced, in a decision welcome in
Washington but controversial at home.
   The United States has lobbied Bonn to accept a replacement for
the 88 Lance missile systems targeted at communist East Germany and
Czechoslovakia. U.S. officials prefer new missiles able to strike
deeper into Warsaw Pact countries.
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz's comments drew immediate fire
from the Free Democrats, the government's junior coalition partner,
and from opposition leaders. Scholz belongs to Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a Free Democrat, has
argued that installing new systems could disrupt the positive trend
in East-West relations.
   Polls indicate West Germans are regarding Moscow with increasing
favor, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev routinely
outranking President Reagan in popularity.
   In an interview released Wednesday by the Munich-based Bunte
magazine, Scholz was quoted as saying of the Lance missiles: ``You
are talking about short-range nuclear weapons. There is no way to
indefinitely get around modernization of these weapons.''
   Defense Ministry spokesman Werner Widder told The Associated
Press he could confirm the contents of the Bunte interview regarding
the Lance missiles.
   He was asked if in fact the word ``modernization'' means
replacing the systems.
   ``That's exactly what it means,'' Widder told the AP.
   Defense experts have said it would make no sense to overhaul the
present systems. The systems, able to launch 600 individual missiles
at their targets in the East, will become obsolete by 1995.
   Widder also said Scholz ruled out a ``zero option'' for the
short-range missiles.
   This calls for eliminating a category of nuclear missiles on both
sides, such as that provided under the U.S.-Soviet
intermediate-range missile treaty signed in 1987.
   Lance missiles have a range of up to 75 miles. Against them are
arrayed 1,365 modern Soviet-built short-range missiles with a range
of more than 180 miles.
   A NATO replacement system for Lance would probably have a range
of 240 miles, within the 300-mile limit specified for short-range
missiles.
   Olaf Feldmann, the Free Democrats' disarmament expert, told
reporters his party disagreed strongly with Scholz's remarks.
   He said the Soviet superiority ``cannot be evened out by further
Western armament, but rather by disarmament.''
   Egon Bahr, the disarmament expert for the opposition Social
Democrats, told reporters Scholz's comments left the impression more
thought was going into armament than into responding to Gorbachev's
missile proposals.
   The Scholz interview with Bunte will appear on the newsstands
Thursday. It was provided in advance to other news media.

   A 21-year-old man who kept showing up at the scene
of fires and offering information about them to authorities has been
charged with setting four blazes, including one that killed four
people, authorities said.
   Buddy W. Marts, 21, may have started 25 or more fires, police
said.
   Marts was arrested Tuesday and charged with arson and murder in
the Aug. 31 fatal fire that also left 31 people homeless, and with
setting three other fires, police said.
   ``He was basically a pyromaniac. He enjoyed fires. He said he set
them to keep warm. But it was August; how cold can it be?''
Detective William Barker said Wednesday.
   The arrest has led authorities to reassess charges against
another young man who was indicted in one of the non-fatal blazes on
the basis of information provided by Marts.
   On Wednesday, Circuit Judge Michael Bolan ordered Marts held
without bail and set Jan. 25 as the next court date in the case,
said spokeswoman Lisa Howard of the Cook County state's attorney's
office.
   Detectives in the Police Department's Bomb and Arson Unit had
come to know Marts when he started offering bits of information
about fires in his neighborhood.
   ``There was something familiar about the fires,'' Detective Tim
O'Meara said. ``He was at a lot of them. His name kept popping up
too many times.''
   O'Meara said Marts admitted setting the fatal fire, and ``tells
us he needs a lot of help.''
   Earlier police reported that Marts often would call the fire
department or people in the building to alert them to blazes he set.
But Detective Wayne Micek, who investigated the case, said that
wasn't so.
   ``I've never seen anybody that perfectly fits the definition of a
pyromania,'' Micek said. ``But he was never hospitalized for mental
illness and wasn't on any medication.''
   Marts, one of nine children, worked at odd jobs near where he was
staying lately with relatives, said Barker. ``He was what we call a
bustout,'' he added. ``He lived where he could until he outstayed
his welcome.''
   Marts provided information on a non-fatal fire that led to the
Nov. 29 indictment of Michael J. Gillon, 21. But last week, police
began to suspect Marts knew too much to be only a witness.
   Authorities are reassessing the charges against Gillon, said Ms.
Howard. He has been free on bond.
   Marts' motive was simply ``rash, angry expression,'' said Chief
of Detectives Edward Wodnicki. ``When he'd have a fight with
someone, he'd vent his frustration by setting fires.''
   The fires were started by lighting piles of trash and many were
small blazes confined to the garbage, O'Meara said. ``If he would
see a pile of garbage in an alley, something would tell him to set
it on fire,'' O'Meara said.
   The fatal fire was in a three-story building that contained
stores and apartments. According to O'Meara, Marts said he didn't
know anyone in the building when he set fire to packing materials on
the first floor.
   Marts was charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the
deaths of Kum Yi, 60; her son, Hong Yi, 30; Jack Kaufman, 84; and
Young Suk Kim, 31. Nine people were injured and 31 left homeless by
the August fire.
   Marts also was charged with arson in three other fires that
damaged property but caused no injuries. He had previous arrests on
charges criminal damage to property and criminal trespass, police
said.

   Iraq said Wednesday it will not export chemical
weapons technology learned during its war with Iran.
   On the sidelines of the international chemical weapons conference
here, Western delegates have been alleging that Iraq's Middle East
neighbors are lining up in Baghdad to learn how to make toxic arms.
   One Western expert, speaking to reporters on condition of
anonymity, said, ``Iraq has used them (chemical arms) for five years
and has lots of experience with a range of agents and delivery
systems. ... more even than the United States and Soviet Union.
   ``Some Third World countries are going to Iraq to learn.''
   But Iraq's foreign minister, Tarik Aziz, speaking in English at a
news conference Wednesday, declared, ``Whatever experience we have
in this respect we will not spread it to others. We are not very
much fond of exporting our experience in this respect.''
   Iraq is believed to have several plants producing chemical
weapons.
   Commenting on negotiations to end the 8-year-old Iraq-Iran
conflict, Aziz said: ``Our feeling is that Iranians are not yet
ready to accept peace.''
   Iraq has said it used chemical weapons only after Iran did.

   A jury began deliberating charges Wednesday
against two Teamsters union officials accused of participating in a
$700,000 ``ghost employees'' scheme that allegedly involved the late
union boss Jackie Presser.
   The labor racketeering and embezzlement trial of Harold Friedman
and Anthony Hughes culminated a six-year effort by the Justice
Department and Department of Labor to turn up wrongdoing in the
Cleveland power base of Presser, president of the 1.6 million-member
union from 1983 until his death July 9 from brain cancer.
   Presser would have been a co-defendant. His health problems led
to several delays of the trial, which started Oct. 24.
   Friedman, 66, is a Teamsters international vice president and
Hughes, 52, a recording secretary for Local 507.
   The 12 jurors received instructions from U.S. District Judge
George W. White in the morning and deliberated for three hours
before adjourning for the day. They were scheduled to resume
Thursday morning.
   Much of the testimony concerned Presser's actions from the early
1970s through 1981, the period when four men are alleged to have
been paid a combined $700,000 from union dues without working.
   Friedman, who became Ohio's most powerful Teamster after
Presser's death, faces two counts owo Pennsylvania utilities on
Wednesday from billing electricity customers for nearly $50 million
invested in four abandoned plants.
   In another action, the court lengthened the time union members
have to sue their unions over alleged free-speech violations,
reviving a North Carolina man's lawsuit against his union.

<HEAD>Report Says Thailand Sends Burmese Home by Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand has forced Burmese students to
return home despite the possibility of detention and harsh treatment
by the military government, Amnesty International reported.
   Thailand forced the repatriation Jan. 6 of 22 students who fled
Burma after the bloody military coup in September, the London-based
human rights group said in a statement received by telex Wednesday
at the Associated Press office in Bangkok. It was dated Tuesday.
   Thai officials have denied forcing students back across the
border and Burma claims those who return are treated well.
   Amnesty International said its concern was based ``on increasing
evidence that many political prisoners arrested for having been
actively involved in the March-September uprising have been held
incommunicado without charge or trial since their arrest and that
some of them have been subjected to torture or other forms of severe
treatment.''
   It reported ``information that Thant Zin, who was repatriated
last Dec. 26 with some 80 other students, is said to have been
arrested after arriving in his hometown of Mergui in Burma's
southern Tenasserim Division. He has apparently been held
incommunicado ... and his current whereabouts are unknown.''
   Among the 22 returned Jan. 6, Amnesty said, were Sai Myon Wyn Tun
and Kyai Moe, both 23, who helped lead the August and September
demonstrations for democracy in their hometown of Taunggyi in Shan
state.
   Amnesty said they were among 36 students of the Shan ethnic
minority rounded up by Thai police two weeks ago in Mae Hong Son
province on the Burma border.
   ``They are said to have repeatedly expressed fears for their
safety and to have petitioned the Thai authorities not to be
returned to Burma and eventually went on a hunger strike,'' the
statement said.
   ``They are understood to have been forced to board a plane from
Tak airport on Jan. 6, 1989, by Thai army personnel. The 14
remaining students are believed to be still held in Tak airport,
pending similar repatriation.''
   Reporters who accompanied the 22 on the flight from Tak to
Rangoon, the Burmese capital, said some expressed concern for their
safety in Burma and distrust of the government. Some carried
placards saying, ``We love democracy and human rights.''
   Thousands of students, who were at the forefront of a nationwide
campaign for democracy, fled to Thai border areas controlled by
ethnic Burmese insurgent groups after Gen. Saw Maung, the Burmese
military commander, seized power Sept. 18 and his troops killed
hundreds of unarmed demonstrators. Thai officials have said about
7,000 young Burmese remain.
   Thailand initially promised the students temporary asylum, but
Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, chief of the army, reached an agreement
with Saw Maung on repatriation when he visited Burma on Dec. 14. Two
processing centers were established, in northern Tak province and
north of Bangkok.
   On Tuesday, Thailand's Cabinet extended the deadline for students
to return home to March 31. Chavalit has proposed that any who miss
the deadline be charged with illegal entry and sent back, according
to a report Wednesday in the Thai newspaper The Nation.
   In a separate document received Wednesday, Amnesty reported
allegations that Burmese soldiers killed some students who returned
outside the formal repatriation program. Other sources have made
similar charges but their validity cannot be determined.
   The 14-page report, called ``The 18 September 1988 Military
Takeover and Its Aftermath,'' said:
   ``In one reported instance, nine returning students were arrested
by government troops in the Burmese town of Kwathaung .. . on 19
November and taken to a military camp. There four ... were allegedly
beheaded by soldiers while the five others who had been held managed
to escape.
   ``In another reported instance, 15 university students, including
three women, were allegedly executed ... after they were captured in
the forest, on their way back home from border areas. The three
young women were allegedly gang-raped by soldiers.''

   In a separate incident, the military arrested a human rights
activist sociology professor from Hunter College in New York and a
Salvadoran human rights activist, the El Salvador Human Rights
Commission said Wednesday.
   Jose Sixto Montoya, 35, died at the scene of the grenade attack.
The injured were evacuated to the Central Diagnostic Hospital in San
Salvador, the capital, about 22 miles away. They were carried out of
the isolated coffee-growing area in hammocks.
   Deborah Cohen, 26, of New York, and Evan Fox Decent, 21, of
Canada, both Lutheran Church workers, suffered shrapnel wounds.
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Ms. Cohen told journalists in
Spanish as she was being evacuated. ``We were talking when I heard a
noise and saw a flash. I have shrapnel in my arms and legs. My eyes
are very bad. I can barely see.''
   Red Cross workers said Decent was in serious condition.
   The two lived in Panchimilama, aiding 350 refugees from El
Salvador's civil war.
   ``They are beloved by the peasants for the work they are doing,''
said Bishop Medardo Gomez, who rushed to Panchimilama after hearing
of the attack.
   Residents said they suspected soldiers of lobbing the grenade
into the camp. They said they have been harassed by soldiers since
they arrived in Panchimilama.
   ``Ever since we arrived at this place in 1986, we have been
accused of being guerrillas,'' said 21-year-old Petrona Alvarado.
``The army constantly searches our homes.''
   An armed forces spokesman denied army troops were involved.
   ``The armed forces is not responsible for a terrorist act
directed against humble campesinos and is investigating the case to
determine those who were responsible,'' the spokesman said, speaking
on the usual condition of anonymity.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Joseph McManus said he had no information
about the case and that even if he did, he would be unauthorized to
release it.
   El Salvador's U.S.-backed government has been at war with leftist
guerrillas for eight years.
   The Human Rights Commission said soldiers on Tuesday arrested
Jack Hammond, a sociology professor at Hunter College, and Celia
Medrano, a member of the commission, near the community of Jucuaran
in Usulutan province, about 80 miles from the capital.
   It said they were investigating allegations of human rights
abuses by the military at the time of their arrest.
   Armed forces spokesman Col. Galileo Torres said he had no
information about any arrests.

   Singer-author Barry Sadler, who wrote the
``Ballad of the Green Berets,'' left a hospital where he was being
treated for brain damage and is believed to be staying with friends,
a lawyer said Wednesday.
   Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth Sadler, and mother claim he is
incompetent and should be placed under guardianship. His 24-year-old
son on Tuesday was named temporary guardian.
   Sadler, 48, was shot in the head during a robbery attempt at his
home in Guatemala City in September and lost 30 percent of his
brain, said Hal Hardin, an attorney for Sadler's wife.
   ``Sometimes he's lucid, sometimes he's not. Sometimes he's
conversant, sometimes he's not,'' Hardin said, adding that Sadler is
partly paralyzed and has other physical problems that call for
medical supervision.
   Sadler was discharged Sunday night from a Veterans Administration
Hospital in Cleveland. Hospital spokeswoman Jane Kennedy-Aspis was
not immediately available for comment Wednesday, her office said.
   Hardin said he and Mrs. Sadler believe Sadler's whereabouts are
known by, or he is with, Stephen K. Somers and Paul E. Hill, two
Ohio men identified as former members of the U.S. Special Forces,
the Green Berets.
   The men were identified in a lawsuit filed by Mrs. Sadler in
Nashville seekng to place her husband under guardianship. She said
she has not seen her husband since Dec. 26, when she visited him in
Cleveland.
   The singer's mother, Blanche Bebe Sadler of Denver, filed a
petition Thursday in Cleveland for guardianship.
   Lawyers for Somers and Hill have promised that Sadler will attend
a court hearing Friday in Cleveland, where Sadler's competence will
be discussed and a guardian appointed if needed, Hardin said.
   ``Their position is Mr. Sadler is competent,'' Hardin said.
``They assure me he's in good shape.''
   ``We assume and we're hoping that he's in good hands and that
he's going to be brought to court,'' Hardin said. ``We're just
concerned that he gets proper medical treatment.''
   ``It's so complicated right now,'' Mrs. Sadler said. ``I want him
back in the hospital.''
   Sadler's ``Ballad of the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 song in 1966.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Cuban military planes landed here
Wednesday with 234 Haitians whose rickety boats, apparently sailing
for Florida, drifted to Cuba, a radio station reported.
   Radio Inter, an independent station, said they included Jean
Tatoune, who led demonstrations in the northern port of Gonaives
that helped drive dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in
February 1986.
   The Haitians reached Cuba in November and December and were
returned in two groups Wednesday about 5{ hours apart, met by
officials of the Red Cross and Haitian immigration, the radio said.
   Tatoune had not been heard from since last summer, after telling
radio stations he was being persecuted by the military and was
unable to hold a steady job. Soldiers ransacked his home in a
Gonaives slum during unrest in 1987.
   Haitians fleeing poverty and political violence normally head for
Florida, but Tatoune and his companions drifted ashore in Cuba, 90
miles west of Haiti.
   Cuba usually shelters and feeds Haitian who wind up in its waters
for several months before either returning them or sending them on
their way in repaired boats. It does not have diplomatic relations
with Haiti or the United States.
   A record 6,000 Haitians who set sail from their homeland were
repatriated in 1988 by the Bahamas and the U.S. Coast Guard, the
Haitian Red Cross has reported.

   Businessman Noah Robinson, Jesse
Jackson's half-brother, pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges that
he ordered members of a Chicago gang to kill a former employee here
in January 1986.
   Robinson was accompanied by two lawyers and several ministers
when he entered his plea during a brief arraignment hearing.
   Robinson has been charged with murder and conspiracy in
connection with the slaying of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber, who once
worked for Robinson in Chicago. Authorities believe Robinson hired
members of the El Rukn gang to kill Barber after several disputes,
then conspired to kill a witness to the slaying.
   A lawyer for Robinson criticized extensive security measures
ordered by Circuit Judge James Moore for Robinson's trial, which
begins Monday.
   The measures are unnecessary and designed to intimidate defense
witnesses and influence jurors, said Albert Taylor Jr., one of
Robinson's Greenville lawyers.
   ``If you can't get a conviction in the courtroom, you can get it
by creating mass hysteria before you walk in,'' Taylor said.
   Spectators will have to pass through a metal detector before
entering the courtroom, and police sharpshooters may be stationed
atop the courthouse, law enforcement officials said.
   Officers also plan to watch for unfamiliar faces in the crowd,
said Greenville Police Chief Mike Bridges, and officers have
received photographs of El Rukn gang members who could be in the
courtroom.
   Robinson, who owns a construction company and several other
enterprises across the country, has maintained that the case is
politically motivated, and that the only state witnesses against him
are criminals who have been promised lenient sentences in exchange
for testimony.
   Although Robinson and Jackson share relatives in Greenville, the
former Democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent
contact with his half-brother.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of two victims from the
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 were shipped to the wrong families in the
United States because of an administrative error, Scottish
authorities said Wednesday.
   One of the families was notified an hour before the funeral was
scheduled to begin.
   John Boyd, the chief constable for the district, said the error
occurred during forensic examinations of the bodies recovered from
the scene of the Dec. 21 crash, in which 270 people died.
   The two victims were Karen Hunt, 20, of Webster, N.Y., and Mary
Lincoln Johnson, 25, of Wayland, Mass.
   ``Throughout the course of the extensive investigation into the
tragic disaster, the trauma and the stress being experienced by all
relatives and friends of the victims has been uppermost in the minds
of all concerned,'' Boyd said in a statement released Wednesday.
   ``It is unfortunate that this isolated administrative error has
occurred, and further sympathies to the families concerned are
offered by the authorities,'' he said.
   The bodies of the two women were released Jan. 4, and Boyd said
authorities learned of the apparent error three days later.
   The mistake was discovered last week when the medical examiner's
office in Rochester, N.Y., concluded that the Hunt family had not
received the correct body.
   FBI agents notified the Johnson family of the mistake just an
hour before a funeral was scheduled on Sunday.
   Ms. Hunt's father, Robert Hunt, said the family planned a prayer
service but would not bury her until spring, when the ground thaws.
   Ms. Hunt was returning to New York after completing a semester in
London as part of a Syracuse University program.
   Ms. Johnson, a graduate of Brown University, was returning to
Wayland for Christmas with her family after spending 14 months
abroad, touring India and teaching English in Taiwan.
   Meanwhile, four explosives experts from Czechoslovakia arrived in
London to assist in the investigation.
   Investigators have concluded that the Boeing 747 was brought down
by a bomb planted in the cargo hold, and have said that the
explosion was consistent with a high-performance plastic explosive
such as Semtex, which is manufactured in Czechoslovakia.

   The United States, Britain and France
vetoed a Security Council resolution Wednesday criticizing America
for shooting down two Libyan MiG-23 war planes over the
Mediterranean last week.
   The vote on the resolution _ sponsored by Algeria and the other
non-aligned members of the council _ was 9-4, with Finland and
Brazil abstaining.
   Canada joined the other allies in voting against the measure.
   The Soviet Union, China, Ethiopia, Colombia, Malaysia, Algeria,
Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia voted in favor.
   Washington says two U.S. Navy F-14s acted in self-defense in
shooting down the two Libyan planes during naval maneuvers over
international waters on Jan. 4.
   As permanent members of the 15-nation council, any one of the
negative votes from the United States, Britain or France was enough
to kill the resolution.
   The vetoed resolution ``deplores the downing of the two Libyan
reconnaisssance planes'' and asked the U.S. Navy to suspend
maneuvers off Libya.
   In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday that aerial
maneuvers scheduled in the area were canceled, and he said plans
were changed to reduce tensions in the region.
   Herbert S. Okun, the second-ranking U.S. ambassador, told the
council before the vote, ``These were not unarmed Libyan
reconnaissance aircraft, as this council has been told. They were
highly sophisticated fighter aircraft, and we have shown the
Security Council and the world photographic proof that they were
armed.''
   Okun said pilots of the U.S. F-14 Tomcat fighters exercised their
right to fire in self-defense during the encounter, a right nations
possess under the U.N. Charter.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters on Friday displayed photographs
of one of the Libyan jets showing shapes resembling missile pods on
its wings and fuselage.
   Libya's deputy ambassador, Ali Sunni Muntasser, said the pictures
were retouched and that the planes were unarmed reconnaissance
flights.
   Britain agreed that the U.S. pilots acted in self-defense.
British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell said the resolution was
``couched in the wrong terms and proceeds from wrong assumptions.''
   Canada's ambassador, Yves Fortier, said later that the resolution
contained ``a one-sided account of the incident,'' sentiments echoed
by France's deputy representative, M. Pierre Brochand.
   After the vote, Libyan Ambassador Ali A. Treiki told the council
that ``in view of the use, or rather abuse of the veto power by some
member states, we feel that this council has been actually paralyzed
and has not been able to take the proper action.
   ``The method of the big stick will not be useful, and dialogue
and the peaceful resolution of problems is the only viable way to
achieve peace.''
   Treiki said he hoped U.S.-Libyan relations will improve after
George Bush is inaugurated as president.
   Soviet Ambassador Aleksandr M. Belonogov, who voted for the
resolution, was non-committal afterward.
   The United States has said the two Libyan MiG-23s were closing in
an attack approach on the two U.S. warplanes, and changed course
five times to intercept the Tomcats before the Americans shot them
down.
   In debate Tuesday evening, Treiki said the U.S. 6th Fleet
informed Libyan aviation authorities more U.S. aerial maneuvers
would take place near Libya on Jan. 16-17.
   Okun told reporters Wednesday the notice was canceled, and the
Pentagon also reported that the aerial maneuvers were scrubbed.
   President Reagan has accused Libya of building a chemical plant
that can produce poison gas, and kept the option of taking military
action to knock out the factory.
   Numerous speakers told the Security Council in the last week that
such statements were inflammatory, and urged Washington to refrain
from such rhetoric and withdraw the 6th Fleet from the Mediterranean.
   The five permanent members of the council, each with veto power,
are the Soviet Union, China, Britain, France and America.

   Singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, who
had a surprise hit with an album of ballads and protest songs and
crossover pop master George Michael are heavy favorites for multiple
nominations for the 31st annual Grammy Awards.
   The nominations were set for announcement Thursday morning at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel, when the results of nomination ballots sent to
more than 6,000 National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences
members will be read.
   Winners will be announced at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles
on Feb. 22 during a three-hour awards ceremony to be televised on
CBS at 8 p.m. EST. Pierre Cossette will produce the show.
   Miss Chapman, whose self-titled album has sold more than 2
million copies, was a surprise star of 1988 amid the techno-pop and
thriving heavy metal sounds.
   Her single ``Fast Car'' was a Top 10 hit, and the album had
several other nuggets. Nominations seem certain for best song, best
album, best single, best new artist, best female pop vocalist and
best contemporary folk performance.
   Michael's ``Faith'' LP has sold more than 6 million copies and
has spawned six hits, including several crossovers on both pop and
soul charts.
   Michael, whose musical style has changed considerably _ some
would say pretentiously, since the days when he was half of the pop
duo Wham! _ should be in line for best song, single and album and
best performance in one or all of the pop, rock and rhythm and blues
categories.
   Others to watch for are nominations for vocal gymnast Bobby
McFerrin, his ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' single and ``Simple
Pleasures,'' LP; the Beach Boys, who have never won a competitive
Grammy, getting another chance with the song ``Kokomo;'' and
possible multiple nods to Steve Winwood for his ``Roll With It''
song and LP; and INXS for their ``Kick'' album and ``Need You
Tonight-Mediate'' single; and Terence Trent D'Arby's debut album.
   Forecasting Grammy nominees and winners is no longer the easy job
it once was, agreed Billboard magazine columnist Paul Grein, who
said the changes in NARAS have become the most apparent over the
past five years.
   ``The academy has recruited many new members, most of them
younger and more ready to give rock its due,'' Grein said Wednesday.
``It's much harder now to get a handle on what they do. Once it was
pretty easy to just line up whoever fit in the Barbra
Streisand-Doobie Brothers-Billy Joel middle of the road form. Now
those acts still do well, but they also recognize rock acts like
Prince, U2, and Bruce Springsteen.''
   The Grammy nominations for an all-time high 76 categories were
culled this year from a record 6,800 entries released between Oct.
1, 1987, and Sept. 30, 1988.
   The membership of NARAS includes certified musicians who have had
their work recorded and distributed, recording engineers and other
technicians as well as music executives and others associated with
the music industry.
   Besides hard rock-heavy metal and rap, best bluegrass was added
as a new award for 1989, and a new fusion field was established by
the academy for the existing categories of best jazz fusion
performance and best new age performance.

   Barbara Bush got a tour of her next home _ 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue _ Wednesday and vowed afterwards ``not...to
change one thing,'' her spokeswoman said.
   First lady Nancy Reagan treated her successor to a 45-minute
afternoon tea and tour of the White House, in particular the second
and third floor areas that will serve as the private residence for
George Bush and his wife after he is inaugurated Jan. 20.
   Mrs. Bush's spokeswoman, Sondra Haley, quoted her as saying after
the private tour, ``It's the most beautiful house I have ever seen.
I'm not going to change one thing.''
   Eight years ago, when the nation was in an economic slump, Mrs.
Reagan was criticized for organizing a high-priced redecoration of
the White House, even though the effort was privately financed.
   Mrs. Reagan, according to her spokeswoman Elaine Crispen,
expressed confidence in Mrs. Bush, saying, ``I know she will take
good care of this wonderful old house.''
   Traditionally, the outgoing president leaves the mansion to
attend the Inaugural, while the new president and his family enter
the White House after the ceremonies.
   The domestic staff at the White House sees to it during the
festivities that the personal belongings of the outgoing president
and his wife are packed and removed. At the same time, the new
families' items are brought in for them.
   Mrs. Reagan, however, had most of their furniture and personal
items transferred to their new home in Los Angeles last October.
President Reagan and his wife spent nine nights at the $2.5 million
Bel-Air estate over the Christmas holidays.
   Mrs. Crispen said that even though Mrs. Bush, as the wife of the
vice president, has often visited the executive mansion, there were
many rooms that she hadn't seen _ such as the kitchen on the second
floor and the laundry on the third floor.
   ``They just kind of went around, looking and seeing what it's all
about,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   Mrs. Crispen said Mrs. Bush will most probably arrange for the
placement of her own larger pieces of furniture after the inaugural.
   At the moment, the private rooms are decorated with items from
the store of furniture, china and artworks that are available for
use in the executive mansion.
   Ms. Healey said Mrs. Bush is currently overseeing the packing at
the vice president's mansion, and she expected the first couple to
bring many things that had graced their home on the grounds of the
Naval Observatory.
   ``All their sitting room, living room and bedroom furniture is
coming, her needlepoint rug, many of their personal things,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Bush crafted the rug over an 8-year period, Ms. Haley said.
   The spokeswoman said she was certain Mrs. Bush would also make
use of the many ``touches of China'' they owned, the items of
furniture and artwork the couple bought during Bush's tenure as the
first American envoy to Peking.

<HEAD>Armenian, Azerbaijani Leaders Agree to Tell Refugees to Go Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the strife-torn republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan agreed Wednesday to try persuading more than 200,000
refugees who fled ethnic violence to return home, the official news
agency Tass reported.
   This will require ``reliable guarantees of security for the
people,'' Tass said.
   About 160,000 Azerbaijanis fled Christian Armenia and at least
90,000 Armenians fled Moslem Azerbaijan when long-term ethnic
tension broke out in riots, arson and other violence that killed at
least 74 people in 1988.
   The government and Communist Party authorities of the two
republics agreed that a turning point is upon them, in apparent
reference to the current lull in ethnic violence, which followed the
Armenian earthquake Dec. 7 that killed at least 25,000 people.
   ``Not only a particular turn of events in Azerbaijan and Armenia,
but also the destinies of perestroika as a whole'' depends on
decisive action, Tass said of the officials' discussion.
Perestroika, or restructuring, is the word used for President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic and social reforms.
   The leaders agreed on joint appeals to refugees to return home,
and to establish contacts between Armenian and Azerbaijani
organizations at all levels in an attempt to promote peace. They
also agreed to combat rumors and misinformation, which have been
blamed for fanning the unrest.
   The meeting included the first and second secretaries of the
Communist parties of both republics, as well as the president and
prime minister of each, Tass said.
   The news agency said nothing about a meeting on the same subject
and the same day that was to include a commission of Gorbachev and
the ruling Communist Party Politburo.

   Communist rebel attacks left at least
21 dead this week, and rebels burned two military buildings and four
passenger buses, military reports said Wednesday.
   In the latest attack, which occurred before dawn Wednesday, New
People's Army guerrillas commandeered two government vehicles from
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos' hometown and then burned four
buses owned by the provincial governor's family, officials said.
   Military reports said at least 11 people _ six rebels, four
soldiers and one civilian _ were killed in three clashes on the
central Philippine island of Negros Tuesday. The reports said two of
the clashes began when a band of rebels ambushed an army patrol.
   Col. Cristobal Gurrea, an army brigade commander on Mindanao
island, said about 80 rebels killed four soldiers when they attacked
a remote army detachment in the province of Agusan del Sur early
Tuesday.
   He said rebels burned two houses comprising the headquarters of
an army battalion nearby.
   Another soldier was killed on Tuesday when rebels waiting in
ambushed fired on a military jeep as it passed by a cemetery in
Candelaria town, 55 miles southeast of the capital Manila, another
report said.
   On Monday, about 100 NPA guerrillas surrounded the village on the
outskirts of Montevista in Mindanao island Davao del Norte province
and overran an army detachment manned by an undetermined number of
soldiers and militiamen.
   A sketchy report released by military officials in Manila said a
village council member and two children were killed in the attack,
which came shortly before dawn. The report mentioned no government
casualties and indicated the troops fled their camp.
   The report said the rebels withdrew two hours later, setting fire
to the camp and taking unspecified equipment abandoned by the
fleeing troops.
   One soldier and one rebel were killed in skirmishes Monday in
Luzon's Mountain Province and Camarines Sur province, other reports
said.
   Military officials in Ilocos Norte province said about 20 NPA
guerrillas commandeered a jeep and a pickup from a government office
in Marcos's hometown of Batac late Tuesday and forced two employees
to drive them to a busy highway after midnight.
   The rebels then set up a checkpoint and for the next several
hours stopped all passenger buses from Manila, said Batac police
chief Florentino Dumlao. All the buses were eventually released
except four owned by Farinas Transit, whose passengers were ordered
to transfer to the other vehicles, he added.
   Dumlao said the drivers of the four Farinas buses were then
ordered to drive three miles on a dusty road up to dead end where
the rebels then set fire to the buses.
   Dumlao gave no motive for the incident but Ilocos Norte Governor
Rodolfo Farinas, whose family owns the bus company, said late last
year he had received but rejected demands by the rebels for payment
of ``revolutionary taxes.''

<HEAD>Dennis Quaid Still May Sing In Jerry Lee Lewis Role As Film Crew
Moves On</HEAD>

   Rock 'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis will
perform most of his music on the soundtrack for a movie about his
life, but actor Dennis Quaid will likely get in on some of the
singing too, a producer said Wednesday.
   ``I'm hoping Dennis might sing a Jerry Lee Lewis song, one or
two,'' producer Adam Fields said as his film crews wrapped up work
in Memphis and prepared to leave for London.
   The movie, ``Great Balls of Fire,'' is based on Lewis' early
recording career in the '50s. Quaid portrays Lewis.
   Filming began in Memphis in October and Lewis said than that he
planned to provide the music for the movie and soundtrack while
Quaid would handle the acting.
   Quaid, who sings with a rock 'n' roll band of his own and plays
the guitar and piano, will handle some of the musical chores in the
film and on the record album that spins from it, Fields said.
   ``The majority of the music in the picture is Jerry Lee's track,
but we've got a long haul until post production,'' he said. ``I hope
to have some of Dennis on the album.''
   Lewis will do all the piano playing, Fields said.
   ``There's only one Jerry Lee, God bless him,'' he said. ``That's
why he's the last of the living legends.''
   The album, with a variety of music from the movie, will include
songs played in barrooms Lewis visited in the early `50s, several of
his first big hits, and even some gospel tunes that influenced him,
Fields said.
   Tom Gray, a spokesman for the movie, said cast and crew members
were getting ready to leave for London, the other main locale of the
movie, which is scheduled to be released in July.
   Lewis was forced to leave England during a tour when he was 23
because of a public outcry over his then-recent marriage to his
13-year-old cousin, Myra. They were divorced in 1971. Lewis has been
married six times.

   A conference of 149 nations pledged Wednesday not to
use chemical weapons and to work to eliminate them, but its final
declaration was tempered by political compromise after five days of
bickering.
   The United States and other Western nations that have nuclear
arms succeeded in blocking efforts led by Arab states to link the
control of chemical and nuclear weapons in the declaration, which is
not legally binding.
   The United States, the most fervent opponent of the Arab
position, said it was gratified by the results of the five-day
international conference.
   ``The U.S. objectives for the conference were to focus worldwide
attention on the problems of chemical weapons use and chemical
weapons proliferation and help put a stop to the use of these
weapons in violation of international law,'' said State Department
spokesman Charles Redman in Washington.
   But Maj. Gen. William F. Burns, head of the U.S. disarmement
agency and leader of the U.S. delegation, indicated the declaration
fell short of expectations.
   ``We believe the goals here have been accomplished,'' Burns told
a news conference, saying the discussion had ``heightened the
concerns of the world'' about chemical arms. But he added:
   ``If the United States had written this statement, which we did
not, it might have been stronger.''
   Burns said the United States would have liked to see explicit
language on sanctions _ a word not mentioned in the final
declaration.
   The United States indicated in a statement it also would have
liked language directly addressing the need for export controls on
chemical products used to make toxic weapons.
   The objective of the conference was to reaffirm the 1925 Geneva
Protocol banning chemical weapons and give new life to languishing
negotiations in Geneva for a total ban on development, use,
production and stocking of chemical arms.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who presided over the
conference, said at least 10 more nations had agreed to sign the
Geneva Protocol, bringing the number of adherents to nearly 130.
   The six-point declaration issued at the conference also affirmed
the U.N. role in investigating chemical weapons use and called for a
strengthening of existing procedures at the United Nations in
dealing with such use _ a reference to enacting sanctions.
   In a compromise to appease Arab states, the declaration stressed
the need to secure ``general and complete disarmament,'' a passage
from a 1978 U.N. document. But the declaration did not mention the
word ``nuclear.''
   Arab nations had said they wanted to reserve the right to possess
chemical weapons to counter what they claim is a nuclear threat from
Israel.
   Earlier Wednesday, Iraqi Vice Premier Tarik Aziz said the Arab
nations would concede their demand in order to get a consensus, and
would pursue their objective at negotiations in Geneva.
   Iraq's use of chemical weapons in its eight-year war with Iran
provided a somber backdrop for the conference, and Iran succeeded in
getting a reference to ``recent violations'' of the protocol in the
declaration.
   The Iranian delegation voiced a reservation after the declaration
was approved, saying the document fell short of a categorical
condemnation of past use of chemical weapons. Iran had been pressing
for language that would indicate Iraqi use of chemicals against Iran
was the ``raison d'etre'' for this conference.
   Work continued until the last minute to find wording that would
satisfy all 149 delegations to the conference.
   The participating states ``solemnly affirm their commitments not
to use chemical weapons and condemn such use,'' the declaration
said. ``They recall their serious concern at recent violations as
established and condemned by the competent organs of the United
Nations.
   ``The participating states stress the necessity of concluding, at
an early date, a convention on the prohibition of the development,
production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons, and on
their destruction. This convention shall be global and comprehensive
and effectively verifiable.''
   Dumas said the unanimous approval of the final declaration was
``tantamount to saying the whole international community has taken a
posture'' against chemical weapons.
   The Soviet Union, which also rejected the Arab demand for linkage
of chemical and nuclear weapons, said it was also satisfied although
it would have preferred ``more energetic words aimed at the
conclusion'' of talks in Geneva.
   The declaration is an expression of political will with no legal
weight nor enforcement powers.
   After two days, it became clear that Arab nations had formed a
front against Israel, which they claim has nuclear weapons. Israel
has never responded directly to allegations it has such weapons.
   Other countries, led by the United States, argued that chemical
weapons, unlike nuclear arms, are not a deterrent.
   Both chemical and nuclear arms are considered weapons of mass
destruction.
   About 20 nations have chemical weapons capabilities, according to
estimates. But the Soviet Union and the United States are the only
two countries to admit possessing them.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan used Wednesday night's
farewell address to warn that parents need to do a better job of
teaching their children about America's heritage, saying that
``well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style.''
   In an apparent reference to Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell
warning in January 1961 about an emerging military-industrial
complex, Reagan talked of ``a great tradition of warnings in
presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for
some time.''
   He said that while he was proud about a resurgence of national
pride during his eight years as president, ``it won't count for much
and it won't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and
knowledge.''
   `` ... Now we're about to enter the '90s, and some things have
changed,'' Reagan said. ``Younger parents aren't sure that an
unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach
modern children.''
   ``If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are.''
   Reagan said that Americans who are 35 or older ``grew up in a
different America'' where patriotic values were taught by parents,
relatives, neighbors and friends. And if all else failed, you could
get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture.''
   ``As as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded
patriotism is no longer the style,'' he said.
   ``Our spirit is back,'' Reagan said, ``but we haven't
reinstitutionalized it. We've got to do a better job of getting
across that America is freedom _ freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, freedom of enterprise. ... It's fragile. It needs
protection.''

   Snow fell on the northern Plains and Rockies on Wednesday, winds
gusted to 60 mph in the California mountains, fog prevailed in parts
of the Mississippi Valley and a few thunderstorms rumbled near the
Gulf Coast.
   Six to 10 inches of snow fell overnight in the mountains of
northern Colorado and southern Wyoming.
   In Colorado, 10 inches of snow fell at Powderhorn Ski Area, 6
inches at Steamboat Springs and 4 inches at Aspen.
   In the northern Plains, several inches of snow fell overnight in

Plains and lower and middle Mississippi Valley, with temperatures
were in the 50s for parts of Missouri and up to 60 degrees at
Emporia, Kan.
   Along the Louisiana coast, temperatures were well up into the 70s.
   Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico produced rain and a few
thunderstorms from the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys across much
of Arkansas and portions of Louisiana to eastern Texas. Some of the
rain was locally heavy.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees below zero at Minot, N.D., to 82 degrees at Naples, Fla. The

<HEAD>Scientists Seek To Stop Construction of Crimean Nuke Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Soviet scientists on Wednesday called on
the government to halt construction of a nuclear power plant in the
Crimea, a popular resort area they say is prone to powerful
earthquakes.
   The 10 scientists, in a letter published by the Communist Party
daily Pravda, said the plant's first reactor, capable of generating
1 million kilowatts, is projected to begin operating sometime this
year.
   Construction of the plant began in 1980 and it is designed to
withstand earthquakes that measure 7 on the 12-point Soviet scale.
   The scientists said, however, that a government commission has
concluded that its site on the Crimea's Kerch Peninsula is prone to
force-9 quakes. In comparison, last month's Armenian earthquake was
rated a force-8 quake by the Soviets.
   The quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, a gauge of energy
released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded
on a seismograph.
   Experts have also found the Crimean plant to be located almost
directly atop an underground dome where high pressures could cause
deformation of the earth's surface and eruptions of volcanic mud and
gas, the scientists said.
   Tuesday night, the Soviet television news program ``Vreyma''
announced that Armenia's sole nuclear power station, which is built
on a geological fault in the southern republic, will be shut down by
March.
   Officials have said the Armenian plant was shaken but not damaged
by the Dec. 7 quake that killed at least 25,000 people in northwest
Armenia, but the quake apparently accelerated the government's
decision to shut down the plant.
   Since the April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in the
Ukraine, the Soviets have moved away from a previously professed
faith in nuclear power as a completely safe energy source and public
opposition has grown.
   Nikolai Lukonin, the Soviet nuclear power minister, announced
Dec. 23 that six projects to build nuclear plants or add more
reactors at exisiting stations had been scrapped because of
earthquake danger or tougher standards imposed after the Chernobyl
accident.
   The Crimean power plant was not among those mentioned by Lukonin.
   The Crimea has some of the Soviet Union's most popular beach
resorts. It is home to 2 million people and welcomes at least as
many vacationers annually, the scientists said.
   The scientists, who included A. Yanshin, a member of the
prestigious Soviet Academy of Sciences, said they decided to go
public with experts' conclusions on the Crimean site because of
``many examples'' in the past where government agencies had either
silenced or twisted the conclusions of scientists and gone ahead
with building projects.
   ``Now the last word rests with the Council of Ministers of the
U.S.S.R., which must decide the fate of this construction project,
which was begun without the necessary scientific survey,'' the 10
scientists said.
   The 1986 Chernobyl accident, the worst in the history of nuclear
power, killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of radiation
that eventually circled the globe.

<HEAD>Duarte Announces Scrapping of Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
on Wednesday announced cancellation of next week's Central American
summit and suggested it take place the second week of February.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias on Friday suggested the summit,
originally scheduled for Jan. 15-16 in San Salvador, be postponed to
allow President-elect George Bush time to create a Central American
policy. Bush is inaugurated Jan. 20.
   The Costa Rican government also said it and Nicaragua, Honduras,
El Salvador and Guatemala needed more time to resolve existing
differences on implementing a regional peace plan.
   Duarte said of the reasons behind Arias' proposal: ``Some are
valid and others are subjective.'' But he said the Bush inauguration
``isn't a basis for delaying the summit.
   ``Maybe the most valid (reason) of all is that a summit isn't
possible if there isn't a preliminary process to review the
results'' of the August 1987 peace plan, he said. A technical
committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday in the Nicaraguan capital of
Managua was canceled.
   The presidents were to have discussed the stalled peace plan they
signed in Guatemala that calls, in part, for democratic guarantees,
political amnesties and an end to civil wars in El Salvador,
Nicaragua and Guatemala.
   The Salvadoran president ruled out an informal meeting of the
region's leaders during the inauguration of President-elect Carlos
Andres Perez of Venezuela on Feb. 2, saying he will not attend
because of ongoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.
   Duarte has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer.

   Maoist guerrillas killed four police officers
in a bold raid against a jungle electric plant, and mountain
insurgents executed four members of a merchant family after a mock
trial, officials said Wednesday.
   The violence occurred Monday night, bringing to 36 the number of
people killed since Saturday in the Mao-inspired guerrilla group's
9-year-old fight to install Marxist rule.
   ``The Shining Path is intent on sabotaging all signs of economic
activity and isolating these regions from the rest of the country to
expand its armed fight,'' said a police spokesmen who refused to be
named for security reasons.
   Police said three dozen rebels attacked a power generating plant
on the outskirts of Tingo Maria but were driven away by police
guards in a 30-minute gun battle that left four officers dead.
   Another Shining Path column in San Jose de Quero shot dead
74-year-old Alfredo Tacza, his son, and a daughter and her husband
after accusing them during a mock trial of providing supplies to
military troops, police said.
   Police said the family operated five dry goods stores in San Jose
and four other hamlets surrounding the highland capital of Huancayo,
125 miles east of the capital Lima.
   The government has given the military broad policing and
political powers throughout the central highlands and
cocaine-producing jungle to resist the Shining Path, whose
insurgency has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
   Tingo Maria, 240 miles northeast of Lima, is the center of
government anti-drug operations into the nearby Huallaga Valley,
where officials estimate 60 percent of the world's cocaine-producing
coca leaf is grown.
   Police said the valley's reputation as a lawless no-man's land
has grown since the Shining Path recently began providing protection
to drug traffickers _who smuggle semi-processed cocaine to Colombia
for refining _ in exchange for money to purchase weapons.
   In previously reported violence since the weekend, rebels killed
11 policemen near Tingo Maria, and 12 campesinos and five others in
the Andes Mountains.

   A young mother was charged Wednesday with
murdering her 2-month-old son and the father was charged with
dismembering the body before the couple told police two purse
snatchers kidnapped the child.
   Officers dredging suburban creeks found five bags containing
parts of Zachary Dacri's body, including his head, police said.
   Part of the body still was missing, and medical examiners had not
determined what caused the infant's death sometime over the weekend,
Capt. Robert Grasso said.
   Grasso would not say what led police to search the waterways or
whether a knife found outside the couple's home was the murder
weapon.
   Police confirmed reports that the couple temporarily lost custody
of another child on allegations of child abuse.
   The baby's 20-year-old mother, Tanya, faces charges of murder,
false reports, hindering apprehension, tampering with evidence,
obstruction of justice and conspiracy in tampering with a corpse,
police said.
   The child's father, Phillip, 22, faces charges of obstruction of
justice, tampering with evidence, aiding in a crime and conspiracy
in tampering with a corpse, police said.
   Assistant District Attorney Barbara Christie said the couple
would be prosecuted in Philadelphia, but would not say what led
police to believe the murder was committed in the city.
   The body parts found Wednesday were in a creek in Bucks County.
Police divers also were to resume a search Thursday morning in
Carbon County for a torso believed tossed into the Pohopoco Creek
from a Pennsylvania Turnpike overpass Sunday night, said Bud
Campbell, a Philadelphia detective.
   Accompanying Campbell at the search site near the Lehigh River
was a young, gaunt woman he identified only as a witness in the case.
   Mrs. Dacri, who also has a 1-year-old daughter, told police one
man grabbed her by the neck and another yanked Zachary from her arms
along with her purse Tuesday afternoon as she walked to a doctor's
office in a Philadelphia shopping mall. She said the two left in a
brown sedan without a license plate and driven by a third man.
   She said there were no other witnesses.
   Police began to suspect murder when the investigation kept
turning up more questions than answers, Capt. Richard DeLise said.
   Police said the couple had lost custody of the other child,
Christine, last January on allegations of child abuse. The girl was
returned to her parents several months later after they received
counseling and underwent therapy.
   The Philadelphia Daily News reported Wednesday that the couple
had taken the older child to Frankford Hospital for emergency
treatment, saying she had stopped breathing while in the bathtub.
   During treatment, doctors noticed signs of swelling related to
malnutrition and that she appeared to be of below-average weight,
the newspaper said. The hospital notified the city Department of
Human Services, which placed the baby in the care of relatives, the
newspaper said.
   DeLise had no comment on the report.
   Police told the newspaper the Dacris had been treated last year
at the Benjamin Rush Center for Mental Health and Mental
Retardation. Preston Ringo, deputy executive director of the center,
said she could not comment on whether the couple had received
treatment.
   The Dacris are natives of northeastern Pennsylvania. He is from
Wyoming County and the baby's mother is from nearby Scranton.

   Former President Jose Luis Bustamante, credited
with pioneering the 200-mile limit at sea, died Wednesday at 93, the
government said.
   Bustamante also was past president of the U.N. International
Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, and was senator-for-life
in the Peruvian Congress, an honor bestowed on the nation's
democratically elected presidents on leaving office.
   The government said Bustamante died at Military Hospital of
coronary complications resulting from deteriorating health over the
past three years. He had been hospitalized under intensive care
since Dec. 10.
   Bustamante, a politically independent lawyer, became president in
1945 and headed a centrist coalition government until 1948, when he
was toppled in a military coup.
   In 1947 Bustamante decreed Peruvian sovereignty extended for 200
miles out to sea. Peruvian officials said the act set a precedent
that has since been adopted by dozens of nations.
   Bustamante guided the world court from 1967 to 1970. He was also
Peru's ambassador to Uruguay and Bolivia and in 1978 mediated a
peaceful end to a border conflict between El Salvador and Honduras.
   He is survived by a sister, Beatriz, and a son, Jose Luis, a
member of Peru's diplomatic corps.

   Authorities questioned the badly injured pilot of a
crashed Boeing 737 Wednesday, but revealed no clues as to why the
jet's undamaged right engine was shut down well before the crash
while the other engine burned.
   The Civil Aviation Authority, meanwhile, ordered increased
inspections on 37 airplanes with CFM56 engines, the type on the
Midland Airways jet that crashed Sunday. Investigators said much
more work was needed to pinpoint the cause of the crash, which
killed 44 people and injured 82.
   The government also ordered immediate checks of engine monitoring
systems on similar aircraft to verify that they correctly indicate
right and left, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning alarm
system could have misled the flight crew.
   Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline Pilots
Association, said this showed that investigators ``must have some
suspicion of these circuits.''
   In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered
inspections of 300 Boeing 737s for possible cross-wiring of engine
warning systems.
   U.S. media reported that the crew of the jet shut down the wrong
engine, and Britain's tabloid newspapers drew similar conclusions in
banner headlines.
   ``Error on the Flight Deck,'' the Today newspaper said. ``Fatal
Error'' said the Daily Star. ``Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine''
said the Sun.
   The Transport Department said that ``evidence obtained early in
the investigation'' indicated both of the plane's engines ``might
have suffered a related failure'' and that possibility was still
being examined.
   The statement from the department's Air Accidents Investigation
Branch also confirmed that the airplane's left engine caught fire
and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot Kevin Hunt had
told ground control the fire was in the right engine.
   The reasons for shutting down the engine ``are not yet clear and
are still under investigation,'' it said.
   The jet, en route from London to Belfast with 126 people aboard,
plunged into an embankment a half-mile short of the runway at East
Midlands Airport in central England as it was trying to make an
emergency landing Sunday night.
   Hunt, whose back and legs were broken in the crash, was
interviewed for 45 minutes at the intensive care unit of Leicester
Royal Infirmary, said the hospital's deputy general manager Carol
Henshall.
   Mrs. Henshall said some of the ``wilder headlines'' had been kept
from Hunt, but friends and colleagues had told him of the news
reports.
   In the United States, NBC News quoted unidentified U.S.
government sources as saying ``the plane's flight recorders, which
monitor engine performance and the pilots' conversations, indicate
the crew shut down the wrong engine. The trouble was in one _ they
shut down the other.''
   But the network said investigators had yet to detemine whether
faulty instruments contributed to the crash.
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified accident investigators,
said the crew believed they were making a routine, one-engine
emergency landing, and apparently thought they had solved the
problem when they shut down an engine.
   Spokesmen for both the FAA and the National Transportation Board
said they knew of no information reaching U.S. officials about the
flight recorders' contents.
   The airplane's two ``black boxes,'' the cockpit voice recorder
and digital flight data recorder, are being examined at the
government's laboratory in Farnborough, outside London.
   According to court documents and federal officials in America,
the FBI is investigating a General Electric Co. admission that test
records may have been falsified at a factory which made parts for
the CFM56 engine that failed here.
   The Seattle factory also made a check and flow valve for the F404
engine aboard the Navy's FA-18 fighter, GE spokesman Richard Kennedy
said Wednesday. A letter from a GE attorney last year said test
records may have been falsified for the fighter plane valves.
   The timer valve made by GE for the CFM56 engine could not have
caused the turbine to fail even if the valve malfunctioned, Kennedy
said.
   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m. Sunday. Government sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hunt reported at 8:06 p.m.
that ``I have an engine on fire.'' Then, at 8:14 p.m., the sources
said he told traffic control: ``I am shutting down the starboard
(right) engine.''
   The plane crashed 12 minutes later at 8:26 p.m.
   The Civil Aviation Authority said that on the advice of
investigators, it was issuing new instructions for the inspection
and monitoring of Boeing 737-300, Boeing 737-400 and Airbus A320
airplanes, all of which use the CFM56 engine.
   The engines are made jointly by U.S.-based GE and a French
company, SNECMA.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said in
Seattle of the FAA's inspection order, ``We certainly believe it's a
prudent measure to go out and check to make sure there's nothing
wrong with the fleet. But certainly this precautionary measure does
not imply there has been any cause identified (for the crash.)''

<HEAD>Indian Women Who Married White Men Fight Possible Expulsion From
Reservation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KING WILLIAM, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Pamunkey Indian sisters are asking a
tribal council to change a tribal law that bans them from living on
the reservation they grew up on because they married outside the
tribe.
   Kim Taylor and Cam Porter, whose grandfather was chief of the
Pamunkey for 42 years, want to find land on the reservation to build
homes and raise families. But because the 23-year-old twins recently
married white men, they've been asked to leave the 1,250-acre
reservation nestled in a bend of the Pamunkey River in southern King
William County.
   ``That's the way the law reads,'' said William ``Swift Eagle''
Miles, the current Pamunkey chief who favors changing the law.
   ``I want to live here,'' Mrs. Taylor said in a recent interview.
``It's a special place for me. I've got a lot of family and we're
all real close. Part of me belongs here. This is my land, really my
land.''
   ``This is where I grew up,'' added her sister. ``This is home.''
   The sisters have crusaded to have the tribal law changed,
gathering signatures from Pamunkey women from as far away as
Philadelphia.
   According to tribal law, Pamunkey women who marry outside the
tribe give up their right to live on the reservation. Men in the
tribe never lose that right. White women may live on the reservation
with their husbands, although like the Pamunkey women they have no
say in the tribe's government.
   Only about 60 people live on the reservation, one of two
remaining in Virginia. All but a handful are retired, and the elders
worry about the tribe's future.
   Despite financial incentives such as paying no property tax and
not having to buy the land one lives on, it's hard to keep young
people on the reservation. The nearest town is 15 miles away, and
it's 40 miles to Richmond, where about a dozen residents commute to
work daily.
   Miles said the law banning white husbands is having a drastic
effect on the reservation population. The Mattaponi Indians, who
live on a much smaller reservation nearby, have a similar rule on
the books but it is not strictly enforced, said Mattaponi Chief
Walter Custalow, and the reservation is crowded with young families.
   One problem, Miles said, is that most of the older Pamunkey had
daughters, and most of those girls married outside the tribe,
whether out of preference or necessity.
   ``They want you to marry a Pamunkey Indian,'' said Mrs. Taylor.
``That's impossible. They're all girls or they're my cousins.''
   Miles said he doesn't know how councilmen will vote at Thurday
night's meeting. ``I think I can convince them,'' he said. ``I have
some pretty strong arguments. We have some old-timers here and I
think it will be close.''
   The sisters say they've been been aware of the law since they
were children. ``If I dated a white guy I used to say, `I can't
marry you 'cause I want to live on the reservation,''' said Mrs.
Porter. ``But you can't help who you fall in love with. I just
figured we'd change the law.''
   Mrs. Taylor said many of their female relatives who married
outside the tribe would come back to the reservation if the law were
changed. She said the two have collected about 20 signatures on
their petition, and that the drive was going slowly because many
tribe members are far-flung and some of the older Indians oppose the
change.
   However, the sisters' cause has won the support of a few
influential tribe members, including Miles and their grandfather,
the former chief.
   ``I think they realize they don't have much choice,'' Mrs. Taylor
said. ``There will be no reservation.''
   Miles says he will bring up the issue at the next meeting of the
tribe later this month. He expects opposition from the old-timers,
but thinks they'll come around eventually, if only out of necessity.
   ``If we don't change that we're going to disappear,'' he said.

   President Reagan bade the nation a sentimental
and contented farewell Wednesday night, asserting he had forged ``a
satisfying new closeness'' with the Soviet Union and saying overall
of his eight years in office: ``We meant to change a nation and
instead we changed a world.''
   Speaking nine days before his retirement to California, Reagan
said, ``the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow.'' He reflected on
the modern presidency, ``You're always somewhat apart. You spend
alot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving.''
   In an Oval Office speech delivered to a prime-time broadcast
audience, he said his chief regret was the mammoth budget deficit
that accumulated after he pushed through the biggest tax cut in
American history.
   Reagan addressed the nation from his Oval Office desk, his left
hand in a splint and swathed in bandages. The president had surgery
over the weekend to straighten a curvature of his left ring finger
that had been caused by an ailment known as Dupuytren's Contracture.
   Reagan said his chief triumphs were the nation's economic
recovery and ``the recovery of our morale'' and America's position
as a world leader. He said his tenure had stood for freedom and
proved that ``democracy, the profoundly good, is also profoundly
productive.''
   He said ``nothing is less free than pure communism, and yet we
have, over the past few years, forged a satisfying new closeness
with the Soviet Union.'' His relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev
blossomed in the course of over five meetings during Reagan's second
term.
   ``My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous
Soviet leaders,'' Reagan said. ``I think he knows some of the things
wrong with his society and is trying to fix them.''
   His recommendation for the future was simple. ``What it all boils
down to is this: I want the new closeness to continue.'' He followed
up with his traditional warnings, ``Trust but verify ... Watch
closely _ and don't be afraid to see what you see.''
   The national debt almost tripled in Reagan's term and he ran up
the biggest budget deficits in history. His final budget proposal,
released earlier this week for the 1990 fiscal year starting Oct. 1,
projects a deficit of $92.5 billion.
   ``Action is still needed,'' he said. ``If we're to finish the
job, Reagan's Regiments will have to become Bush's Brigade.''
   He called himself a ``citizen politician'' who sought office ``in
part to put up my hand an say, `Stop!' to big government, and added,
``I think we have stopped alot of what needed stopping.''
   He said he had changed American through the tax cuts, which, he
said, gave people greater incentive to work.
   He said his tenure had changed the world with a treaty to reduce
superpower nuclear stockpiles. Moreover, he said, his term had seen
``the regional conficts that rock the globe'' begin to recede. He
cited Afghanistan, the Middle East and Angola.
   He also said, ``Countries across the globe are turning to free
markets and free speech.''
   Of the disappointments during his tenure, Reagan said little.
Nothing of the barracks bombing that took several hundred Marine
lives in Beirut, nothing of the Americans taken hostage and still
held captive, nothing of the trade deficits or the scandals that
tarnished his administration.
   Nothing of the decision to sell arms to Iran and use the proceeds
to fund the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The Contras, subject of so
many Reagan speeches, were not mentioned.
   Citing ``a great tradition of warnings in presidential
farewells,'' Reagan offered ``one that's been on my mind for some
time.''
   He said an ``eradication of the American memory'' of the nation's
history, ``could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American
spirit.''
   ``We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is
freedom _ freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of
enterprise _ and freedom is special and rare. It's fragile; it needs
protection.''
   Reagan said even other countries had to acknowledge his success
in bringing America out of an economic and morale slump.
   ``Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free
speech _ and turning away from the ideologies of the past. For them,
the Great Rediscovery of the 1980s has been that, lo and behold, the
moral way of government is the practical way of government.''
   Reagan summarized what he said his presidency had proven: ``Once
you begin a great movement, there's no telling where it will end. We
meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world.''
   He said in the 1970s the United States entered into detente based
on Soviet promises, not actions. ``But this time, so far, it's
different,'' he said, citing Gorbachev's push toward economic and
political reform within the Soviet Union and his promised withdrawal
from Afghanistan.
   The roughly 20-minute speech was Reagan's 34th from the Oval
Office.
   In using television for the address, Reagan chose his favorite
medium, and also borrowed a page from the presidential books of
Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1981 and Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in
1961.
   The speech was heavily studded with Reagan's reflections on his
presidency, on a fast-track existence that often had him ``going by
too fast in a car someone else was driving, and seeing the people
through tinted glass.''
   ``And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind
the glass, and connect,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan said he likes to stand at a window looking toward Virginia
and providing a rich view of the Washington Monument and Mall, and
said that ``I have been thinking a bit at that window.''
   ``The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things
that I'm proudest of. One is the economic recovery. ... The other is
the recovery of our morale; America is respected again in the world,
and looked to for leadership.''
   ``I've been asked if I have any regrets. I do. The deficit is
one,'' he said. ``I've been talking a great deal about that lately,
but tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue.''
   Reagan will continue being visible, with an appearance at a
military ceremony in his honor at Andrews Air Force, Md. on Thursday
and his visit Friday night to a meeting of the Knights of Malta, a
Roman Catholic civic organization, in New York.
   The White House has not divulged Reagan's inauguration-week
schedule, although the president and his wife, Nancy, evidently will
leave the capital immediately after President-elect Bush is sworn in
on Jan. 20.
   The speech came during a week in which the president was winding
up his official business, including the submission of a proposed
fiscal 1990 budget to Congress, and taking part in sentimental
going-away ceremonies.
   After he posed with his Cabinet for the official class picture,
Reagan was given the chair that he used for eight years in the
Cabinet Room. The presentation was made by Samuel Pierce, the only
remaining member of the original Reagan Cabinet formed in 1981.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won't be out kissing
babies to win election to the new Congress of People's Deputies
because the Communist Party nominated him to a guaranteed seat.
   The official news agency Tass reported Wednesday that Gorbachev
was one of the 100 people nominated by the party's Central Committee
on Tuesday for its 100 guaranteed seats. The new 2,250-member
congress will elect a working parliament and the nation's president
from among its members.
   Gorbachev, the Communist Party leader, was named president by the
old parliment in October. He is widely expected to be elected to
that position by the new one.
   The political reform law passed in November promised
multiple-candidate elections would be allowed. But the Communist
Party example of one seat, one candidate dampens the prospects for
widespread contention.
   Tass also reported Wednesday that the Soviet Peace Foundation and
eight other official peace organizations nominated 17 candidates for
the congress, including journalist Fyodor Burlatsky and former world
chess champion Anatoly Karpov.
   Tass did not say if the peace organizations also have guaranteed
seats or if they nominated more candidates than positions.
   One-third of the 2,250 deputies will be elected by organizations
such as the Communist Party and trade unions. The other two-thirds
will be elected by the public on March 26.

   Israeli troops will never be able to halt the
Palestinian uprising and a political solution is needed, the army's
top officer was quoted Wednesday as saying. Another general resigned
and said the violence is making soldiers malicious.
   Troops shot and wounded nine Arabs on Wednesday in clashes that
have occurred almost daily since the 13-month-old revolt began to
protest Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Also, the army said Israeli warplanes bombed a base north of the
Lebanese port of Sidon belonging to an extremist Palestinian
guerrilla faction led by Abu Nidal.
   The Fatah Revolutionary Council, led by Abu Nidal, has been
blamed for numerous attacks against Israel and Western European
countries. The army said the raid was part of an ongoing attempt to
pre-empt attacks against Israel.
   Meanwhile, debate continues to heat up over the army's role in
the occupied lands. Fifteen Israelis have been killed in the
uprising that began Dec. 8, 1987. At least 349 Palestinians have
been killed, most by army gunfire.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, was quoted
Wednesday as saying that troops have been unable to halt the
rebellion and that a political solution was needed.
   ``There is no such thing as eradicating the uprising because in
essence it expresses the struggle of nationalism,'' the Jerusalem
Post quoted Shomron as telling a closed session of Parliament's
defense and foreign affairs committee on Tuesday.
   Shomron also said that since November, Fatah and other factions
under the control of PLO chief Yasser Arafat had halted hostile
operations against Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
newspaper reported.
   The remarks sparked loud debate among committee members, the Post
said.
   Former army Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan said ``collective
punishment'' _ punishing a group of Palestinians for an act by an
individual or smaller group _ still was appropriate, the Post
reported.
   ``Collective punishment merely prompts more civilians to join the
ranks of the protesters,'' countered Micha Harish of the
left-leaning Labor Party.
   Also Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Menachem Einan, who is leaving his job
as the army's logistics chief, was quoted in the daily Maariv as
saying he was ``very worried about the level of morality of Israel's
soldiers in the territories.
   ``We are making them face provocations that inspire maliciousness
all too quickly,'' he said.
   An army spokesman said Einan had been scheduled to retire Friday
for a civilian job and that his resignation was unrelated to the
criticism.
   The military command refused an Associated Press request
Wednesday to interview Einan. It did not immediately respond to his
published remarks.
   In the interview, Einan traced his misgivings about the
territories to the Israeli government's handling of the 1982 Lebanon
invasion, which escalated into a three-year conflict instead of a
limited campaign as initially planned.
   ``My big lesson is that perhaps there are times when the fighting
military echelons cannot accept to the last letter the instructions
given by the political echelons,'' he said.
   In another development, a senior army officer in the Gaza Strip
held a first-ever meeting with the head of the Moslem extremist
group Hamas, the daily Haaretz reported.
   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin reportedly discussed political and economic
topics affecting Gaza with Brig. Gen. Aryeh Shiffman, who heads
Israel's military administration of Gaza, the newspaper said.
   Most of the nine Palestinians wounded in Wednesday's clashes were
in the Gaza Strip's Nusseirat refugee camp, where troops shot and
wounded five Palestinian youths during confrontations with
stone-throwers, Arab doctors said.
   The army said it was checking the reported casualties.
   Israeli newspapers reported that the army indicted three
Palestinians on murder charges for allegedly throwing three
firebombs at an Israeli passenger bus Oct. 30 in the West Bank city
of Jericho.
   Five Israelis, including a soldier, a woman and her three small
children, were killed in the attack. The Palestinians were
identified as being in their early 20s.
   In another development, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Wednesday that the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency was
being replaced as part of a scheduled rotation, and not because of
media criticism of the service.
   In an unprecedented decision Tuesday, the Supreme Court overruled
the military censor and gave a Tel Aviv newspaper permission to
print an article that suggests the Mossad chief was responsible for
several recent failures of the agency.
   All articles concerning Israel's security must be submitted to
the censor. The Mossad chief's name and details of his activities
traditionally are banned from publication.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's farewell address to the
nation was a unapologetic celebration of administration successes
and a declaration of victory that ignored the failures and
frustrations suffered over the last eight years.
   Leaving office with high popularity ratings, Reagan seemed
determined to prove he was unbowed by the demands and pressures of
an office that has beaten down some of his predecessors.
   It was vintage Reagan. He was irrepressibly sunny and optimistic,
determined to look on the bright side and to remain silent about the
sore spots. If he wished he'd done something differently, he wasn't
talking about it Wednesday night.
   ``My friends, we did it. We weren't just marking time; we made a
difference,'' Reagan said in his nationally broadcast address.
   ``We meant to change a nation and instead we changed a world.''
   The biggest accomplishments, he said, were the economic recovery
and the creation of 19 million new jobs over the last eight years.
Moreover, he cited the fact that ``America is respected again in the
world, and looked to for leadership.''
   Regrets? Well, yes, but Reagan mentioned only one _ the deficit _
and he brushed it aside in just two sentences.
   George Bush must be wishing he could dispose of the towering
problem so easily. Instead, the deficit and the mountain of debt
that nearly tripled during Reagan's term will handcuff Bush
financially when he takes office on Jan. 20.
   The Iran-Contra affair that engulfed Reagan's presidency did not
get a mention. Nor did defense-contractor scandals, the American
hostages in Lebanon, the ethical lapses of some members of his
administration, the homeless, and the nightmare of the terrorist
bombing that killed 241 American servicemen in Beirut.
   The Contra rebels in Nicaragua, once a subject of consuming
passion of the Reagan White House and the topic of countless
speeches, were overlooked in the president's upbeat glance at world
affairs. He once said he wanted the Sandinistas to say ``uncle'';
they have not.
   He said the superpowers have begun to reduce stockpiles of
nuclear weapons and said that ``hope for even more progress is
bright.'' In addition, ``The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone,
the Soviets are leaving Afghanistan, the Vietnamese are preparing to
pull out of Cambodies and an American-mediated accord will soon send
50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.''
   Basking in the warmth of his meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, Reagan said he had ``forged a satisfying new closeness''
with Moscow.
   He told an incident to make a point about man's yearning for
freedom but, in a way, seemed to reveal a naive understanding about
the vast security precautions that are always taken on his behalf.
   Reagan recalled that he strolled with Nancy through a shopping
district of Moscow during last year's summit. As Russian citizens
rushed to meet him, Reagan said, Soviet KGB agents suddenly pushed
and shoved at the crowd _ underscoring, he said, that a communist
government views freedom and human rights differently than Americans.
   The fact is, American Secret Service agents accompanying Reagan
were shoving at the crowd, too. Secret Service agents do that in
America, too, when they're trying to protect a president.
   Even after two terms in the White House, Reagan cast himself as a
Washington outsider, ``a citizen politician'' who came to the
capital to stop Uncle Sam from imposing more rules and regulations
and to curb government's appetite for taxes.
   The onetime Hollywood actor said he didn't earn the nickname of
``great communicator'' because of his style or his script, but
because of the content of his ideas. And he made clear that his
ideas were exactly what the country had needed.
   Dismissing the objections of his critics, Reagan said, ``The fact
is, what they called `radical' was really `right;' what they called
`dangerous' was just `desperately needed.'''
   Once again, Reagan spoke romantically about his vision of a
``shining city on a hill'' _ a metaphor for a country living in
harmony and peace and prosperity.
   ``And how stands the city on this winter night?'' Reagan asked
rhetorically. ``More prosperous, more secure and happier than it was
eight years ago.''

   President-elect Bush has picked retired Admiral
James D. Watkins to be the Secretary of Energy in his
administration, CBS News reported Wednesday night.
   The selection of the 61-year-old former Chief of Naval Operations
would fill the last remaining spot in the Bush Cabinet as the vice
president prepares for next week's inauguration.
   The only major post still unfilled by Bush is the ``drug czar''
to oversee the nation's fight against illegal drugs.
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush defended his decision to attend Japanese
Emperor Hirohito's funeral next month against criticism from those
who still resent Hirohito's World War II role.
   ``I'm doing what's right,'' Bush told reporters. President Reagan
had earlier said Bush was doing the proper thing.
   Bush, in remarks to reporters before a meeting with black college
presidents, said his appointment of an energy secretary _ the last
vacancy in his Cabinet _ will be ``coming up pretty soon.''
   ``We'll probably have some announcements soon, very soon,'' Bush
added.
   There has been an outcry in Great Britain over the royal family's
plan to send Prince Philip as its representative to the funeral of
its former wartime adversary.
   There has been little U.S. commentary over Bush's decision. Bush
had no qualms about criticism he may get from fellow World War II
veterans.
   Bush, a former Navy aviator whose plane was shot down by the
Japanese in the Pacific in 1944, said, ``I think I speak from a
pretty good vantage point and the answer is no.''
   ``We have a good relationship with Japan. I want to see it even
better. And this doesn't concern me a bit. And you're talking to a
person who was in combat in World War II,'' he said.
   ``I feel you look ahead, not always look back. You do what's
right. I'm doing what's right,'' Bush said.
   Asked if he would visit Australia and Korea as well when he goes
to Japan, Bush said, ``There are no plans formulated, but I am going
to Japan.''
   Asked if he would stop in any other countries on the journey to
Japan, Bush said, ``I haven't thought about that.''
   His future chief of staff, John Sununu, joked to reporters,
``Don't forget Tahiti and Guam.''
   Bush, 64, became the Navy's youngest aviator after enlisting on
his 18th birthday soon after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.
   He was shot down Sept. 2, 1944, while piloting a torpedo bomber
near a Japanese-held island, Chicachi Jima. Two of his crew
perished, but Bush himself was rescued by an American submarine that
happened to be patrolling in the area.
   Bush got an early start Wednesday to his stated plan of barring
questions at photo opportunities once he becomes president. He did
so by striding up to the pool of reporters waiting to follow him
into the meeting with black educators, and fielding several
questions.
   ``We're starting this marvelously enlightened policy that
respects the dignity of the job you do in this _ it is the fifth
estate, isn't it?'' Bush joked.
   ``Aren't you thrilled with the new policy, though, seriously? The
dignity that goes now with your jobs?'' he asked.
   Afterwards, Bush spoke with two dozen leaders of black colleges
and universities.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, president of Morehouse School of Medicine and
Bush's choice for secretary of health and human services, also
attended the meeting, along with Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and
Lauro F. Cavazos, the holdover secretary of education.
   Benjamin Payton, president of Tuskegee University in Alabama,
said the presidents asked Bush not to penalize colleges for high
student loan default rates, as former Education Secretary William J.
Bennett proposed last year. The Education Department, under Cavazos,
has held off on the crackdown.
   ``Institutions of higher education do not make these loans. ...
These are transactions between banks and individuals,'' said Payton,
who asked Bush to ``see to it that institutions are not penalized.''
   S. Dallas Simmons, president of Virginia Union University, said
Bush and Cavazos ``indicated this would not be the last meeting, but
only the first of many during the years to come.'' He added, ``I am
leaving the meeting feeling very, very good.''
   Leroy Keith Jr., president of Morehouse College in Atlanta,
called it ``an extraordinary session.''
   ``He indicated that he was going to be an education president. He
reiterated it to us,'' said William R. Harvey, president of Hampton
University in Virginia. He called Bush ``a very apt pupil'' with ``a
long history of support for black higher education.''

   Twenty percent of all American workers are now
employed by companies that test for drug use, but only one employee
in 100 actually is tested in a 12-month period, the government
reported today.
   Ninety-one percent of employers have neither testing nor
counseling programs, the Labor Department said, but larger companies
are much more likely to have such programs.
   Job applicants are far more likely to be tested than employees,
the department said. It billed its survey of 7,500 establishments as
the most extensive study to date on drug testing in the workplace.
   Among establishments with testing programs, about two-thirds
tested only those workers suspected of drug use, while one-fourth
had programs that subjected all employees to possible testing.

   Anti-smoking campaigns have been most
successful in getting white men to put out their cigarettes, and a
new government report calls for more efforts aimed at women,
children, minorities and high school dropouts who are not quitting
as quickly.
   The annual report, issued by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on
the 25th anniversary of the government's first such report, says the
proportion of American smokers has declined from 40 percent of the
population in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987.
   ``These changes represent nothing less than a revolution in
behavior,'' Koop said in the report. ``Thanks to the remarkable
progress of the past 25 years, we can dare to envision a smoke-free
society.''
   However, he said, ``smokers are disproportionately found in
groups that are harder to reach, and this disparity may increase
over time. Greater effort and resources will need to be devoted to
achieve equivalent reductions in smoking among those whose behavior
has survived strong, countervailing pressures.''

   The Air Force can't find the flight data
recorder from a nuclear test missile and the Pentagon says the
Soviets may have snatched the device from where it splashed down in
the western Pacific Ocean.
   The recorder was aboard a Minuteman 2 missile test-fired from
California at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands on July 7,
1987, according to Army Maj. Bill O'Connell, a spokesman for the
Defense Department.
   The story was first reported Tuesday by the CBS Evening News and
later confirmed by the Pentagon.
   The flight data recorder was part of the dummy warhead on the
missile, which did not carry any nuclear weapons on its launch from
California. The Air Force periodically tests missiles by launching
them from California at Kwajalein, 5,000 miles away.

   A 65-year-old woman who was allowed to decide
her rapist's prison term chose a 4{-year sentence that will put him
behind bars immediately, then said of being allowed to pick the
penalty: ``Wasn't that something?''
   ``He was so kind,'' the victim said of Hennepin County Judge
William Posten. ``He said, `It's your decision.' I liked that.''
   Posten on Monday gave the victim two choices in the prosecution
of James Halvorson, 25. She could have the case go to trial and hope
for a conviction, which could have meant a 108-month prison term, or
she could accept the conditions of a plea agreement for a 54-month
prison sentence effective immediately.
   The woman chose immediate incarceration in lieu of a trial
because Halvorson was free on bond and she feared being attacked
again, said Assistant County Attorney Kevin Johnson.

   A former Navy enlisted man tried to sell
submarine warfare secrets to the Soviets because he had been
discharged for indecent exposure, according to authorities who said
no damaging information was passed along.
   Craig D. Kunkle, 39, was arrested Tuesday at a Williamsburg motel
as he tried to turn over classified documents to two undercover FBI
agents posing as Soviet officials, said Irvin B. Wells III, head of
the FBI's Norfolk office.
   Kunkle, a former chief petty officer, was charged with attempting
to deliver classified information to a foreign government. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   Kunkle, of Virginia Beach, was discharged from the Navy in
October 1985 as non-judicial punishment for multiple acts of
indecent exposure committed at the Barber's Point Naval Air Station
in Hawaii, according to an FBI affidavit filed in U.S. District

   Sponsors of a law to compensate
Japanese-Americans who were forced to live in internment camps
during World War II say it would take 60 years to make reparations
under the spending plan proposed by President Reagan.
   ``Unless Congress appropriates the authorized maximum amount ...
many of the eligible recipients may die before receiving their token
compensation,'' Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, said Tuesday.
   Matsunaga and the other lawmakers who sponsored the 1988 law said
they would press the House and Senate budget committees to vastly
increase the $20 million in the president's 1990 budget for the
reparations.
   Up to $500 million can be appropriated in any single year until
$1.2 billion has been paid out.

<HEAD>Episcopalians Strong In Congress And Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In proportion to their numbers, Episcopalians as
usual hold far more than their share of seats in the new Congress,
and next Friday for the 12th time in U.S. history, an Episcopalian _
George Bush _ occupies the White House.
   There have been more presidents of that denomination than any
other, although it rates only seventh in size. Its 2.8 million
members make up only about l.2 percent of the population.
   But it holds about 12 percent of the seats in the new 101st
Congress _ 63 of 535 seats in the House and Senate. In the Senate
alone, Episcopalians are an even bigger proportion, 20 members, or a
fifth of the l00 senators, more than any other denomination,
although several others are much larger.
   Episcopal prominence in politics began in early America, with the
nation's first president, George Washington, belonging to that
church, as have 10 other presidents, most recently Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Gerald Ford.
   Other Episcopalians among the founders and early presidents were
James Madison, who originally planned to become a minister but
switched to politics, and Thomas Jefferson, who in his spare time
produced the Jefferson Bible version.
   It retains the ethical teachings, but eliminates miracles,
causing Unitarians to claim him, although that denomination wasn't
formed until the year before he died in 1826 _ long after his
presidency.
   Protestants, along with Episcopalians, have always predominated
in Congress, and still do, with 334 of 535 seats, but the number of
Roman Catholics has swelled over the last two decades, now totalling
139 seats.
   That is more than any other single denomination, although
slipping slightly by two from the previous Congress. Methodists hold
the second largest number of seats _ 75 _ down by one, while
Episcopalians increased three _ to 63.
   Altogether, about 52 percent of Congress members belong to those
three traditions.
   Baptists made up the fourth biggest denominational bloc _ 55 of
them _ gaining one. For the first time, they surpassed
Presbyterians, whose number dropped four to 53.
   The preliminary figures on affiliations of the New Congress were
compiled by Rob Boston of Americans United for the Separation of
Church and State in Washington.
   In sixth place were Jews, who gained two members to a total of
39, while the next-placed Lutherans also gained two to a total of
25. The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) gained one to total
four.
   Other numerically unchanged contingents included:
   United Church of Christ, 13; Mormons, 11, Unitarian
Universalists, 10, Eastern Orthodox, seven, Churches of Christ,
five, Christian Scientists, two, and several other Protestant groups
with one each.
   Twenty-three Congress members, up one, were listed only as
Protestant with no specified denomination, while five members, one
more than previously, were listed as having no religious affiliation.
   Bush, a lifelong Episcopalian, belongs to St. Martin's Episcopal
Church in Houston, and attends various Episcopal churches in
Washington, including the National Cathedral, where he will take
part in a post-inaugural service Jan. 22.
   Of the 39 presidents who have preceded him, there have been,
besides the 11 other Episcopalians, the following:
   Six Presbyterians, four Methodists, three Congregationalists (now
United Church of Christ) three Baptists, three members of the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), two Dutch Reformed, two
Quakers, two Unitarian Universalists and one Roman Catholic _ John
F. Kennedy.
   Two presidents never affiliated with any church. One of them,
Abraham Lincoln, was among the most religiously minded of all the
presidents, while the other was the man who succeeded him after his
assassination, Andrew Johnson.

   The theme for Roman Catholicism's 1989 National
Migration Week, observed across the country Jan. 9-14, is ``Migrants
and the Blessed Mother.''
   In designating the theme, Pope John Paul II pointed out that the
Virgin Mary's ``earthly life was marked by a continual pilgrimage
from one place to another'' _ from Nazareth to Bethlehem and then in
flight to Egypt to save the child Jesus and later back again to
Nazareth.
   ``She shines as a sign of certain hope and comfort to the pilgrim
people of God,'' the pope said.
   The week was insituted by the U.S. National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in 1980 to emphasize commitment and service to
people on the move, including political refugees, economic migrants,
seasonal farm workers and displaced persons.

   A tendency to assume that religion is concerned
largely with salvation in the hereafter rather than with present
life was stunningly refuted by a recent study.
   It found that religious bodies led the field in charitable work
for others, surpassing foundations and corporations.
   Brian O`Connell, president of Independent Sector, a coalition of
660 corporate, foundation and voluntary philanthrophic organizations
which sponsored the study, said:
   ``We realize more than we had expected how much the organized
neighborliness of religious organizations means to the kind of
caring society we are.''
   The study found that almost half of the $4l.4 billion contributed
in 1986 to religion was used to support services to others, the rest
spent on internal activities such as worship and religious education.
   Pollster George Gallup, whose organization gathered the data,
said it showed churches are ``among our most cost-effective
institutions'' in philanthropic work, with minimal administrative
overhead.

<TEXT>
   The new year ushers in a new wildfire
season, an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small Montana
tourist town on the northeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park.
   For two months last summer the citizens of Cooke City and its
tiny suburb, Silver Gate, were showcased on the nightly TV news and
splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers as forest
fires threatened to burn them out.
   Pinched between the Storm Creek and Clover-Mist blazes, an
estimated 150 seasonal residents and dozens of tourists were
evacuated twice while hundreds of firefighters faced down walls of
flame which threatened annihilation. Eventually, millions of
dollars, thousands of man hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved
the towns.
   No structures were lost within the towns' boundaries, but seven
residences and five outbuildings were destroyed in the area.
   One wag even changed the sign leading into town by adding a
single letter, rechristening it ``Cooked City.''
   Their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the
hunting season crippled, the folks of Silver Gate and Cooke City
straggled home in mid-September to pick up the pieces.
   ``The first thing most people around here did was go on
vacation,'' said Patti Smith, owner with her husband, Bob, of the
Bearclaw Service and Cabins, a gas station and small motel. ``The
fire really took a toll on a lot of folks.
   ``Business was way down this fall because we didn't have the
hunters, but we got a lot of curious weekenders from Cody and
Billings who wanted to see how bad it was.''
   The Smiths, who own the only photocopy machine for 30 miles in
every direction, found their small gas station and convenience store
a mecca during the fires. The U.S. Forest Service, which coordinated
some of its firefighting efforts from Cooke City, set up shop near
the photocopy machine, and everybody who had information or was
seeking some crammed into the Smiths' log cabin office.
   ``It was crazy for a while,'' said Mrs. Smith, 33. ``We got sent
out twice. The first time I grabbed all the photo albums but forgot
our wedding pictures. The second time the sirens went off and we had
to leave, my parents had just arrived from North Platte, Neb., so we
all went to Red Lodge (Mont.), got nice motel rooms, and crashed.''
   Winter now cloaks Cooke City and Silver Gate, and only about 70
year-round residents remain to weather the below-zero months. The
only grocery store is on its winter schedule, open just Friday
through Monday, and many curio shops are shut up tight, but the
Bearclaw cabins and most of the other motels are open for winter
sports enthusiasts.
   Although postmistress Vicky Menuey keeps the office open five
days a week, mail only arrives to ZIP code 59020 from the outside
world on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
   Nearly four feet of snow has piled up against the Smiths' cabins
and ``that's just the way I like it,'' exulted Mrs. Smith. ``No
smoke, no flames, and plenty of tourists.''
   It's snowmobiling season now, and clubs from as far away as
Canada and Illinois are booked into Cooke City's motels to take
advantage of the beautiful scenery and 80 miles of trails in the
area. The state pays Bob Smith, 34, to groom the trails. Because of
the heavy day use, Smith works mostly at night in subzero
temperatures. His wife keeps track of him by walkie-talkie.
   Patti Smith relishes the winter months because she gets caught up
on chores, chats with her neighbors and watches videos. The hottest
tape in Cooke City this winter is ``Three Men and a Baby,'' for
which there's a waiting list. This winter, Mrs. Smith also has a new
project.
   ``I'm going to do my scrapbooks,'' she said, hauling out from
underneath a counter a huge cardboard box overflowing with newspaper
clippings and official fire bulletins, among them a firefighters'
newsletter, ``The Griz Gazette,'' purporting to have spotted Elvis
Presley on the fire line.
   ``I've got the whole story right here in this box,'' said the
amateur historian. ``Of course, a lot of it is wrong.''
   Like nearly everybody else in Cooke City and Silver Gate, Mrs.
Smith says she never wants to go through another summer like the
last one.
   Nationwide, it was the second worst wildfire season since the
government started keeping records. Although the 5.9 million acres
burned in 1988 did not match the 28 million acres destroyed in 1926,
the $583.8 million spent to fight 75,000 fires set a record.
   Because of the unprecedented fire season which burned nearly 1.5
million acres in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, including
705,000 acres within the national park, Mrs. Smith and her friends
and neighbors worry about what's happening underneath the blanket of
snow this winter.
   ``Are there still smoldering embers out there deep in the roots
of the trees?'' wondered Mrs. Smith. ``Could the fires survive the
winter and pick up and come at us again?''
   Park officials and fire experts have asked themselves the same
questions.
   Rod Norum, a fire behavior analyst with the National Park
Service, said he would not be surprised if pockets of fire are found
in the greater Yellowstone area come spring.
   ``It's not the sort of thing to be concerned about, it would only
be a matter of curiosity and interest because the fires are still
under suppression orders and they would be mopped up and put out
immediately, I'm sure,'' said Norum, who is based at the Boise
Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.
   In his 18 years of studying wildfires, Norum has come across
several incidents where wildfires buried themselves in the roots of
trees and grasses and smoldered all winter only to pop up through
the snow in the spring.
   When the snow melts in May, the Yellowstone country will provide
an answer to a question troubling lots of people whose lives were
changed by the wildfires of '88.

<HEAD>Gail Strickland Plays Controversial Role on `HeartBeat'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The creator of ABC's ``HeartBeat'' wanted Gail
Strickland to play a doctor's wife, but she opted for the role of a
lesbian nurse-practitioner.
   ``I heard of the project from Sara Davidson, who was the writer
and creator,'' said Strickland, who stars in this series set in a
women's medical clinic.
   ``We've been friends for a long time. She said she wrote it with
me in mind for one of the characters. But as I read the script I
found the character didn't appeal to me. It was the charming,
sophisticated wife of a doctor, and I'd played that kind of role too
many times.
   ``But the role of the nurse-practitioner, Marilyn McGrath,
appealed to me very much. She was funny and wise and had a way of
dealing with things I found interesting.''
   The character was also gay, and Strickland's portrayal, beginning
with the series' brief run last year, is the first openly lesbian
character on series television.
   ``It wasn't the fact that she was gay that I found interesting,''
said Strickland. ``It was the other aspects of the character. Her
sense of humor was very much like my own. After I read the script I
asked for the role. I didn't give much consideration to the fact
that she was gay.''
   Apparently a lot of other people have. She said a number of
viewers' letters have complained about the character's sexual
preference, but an equal number have praised her portrayal.
   McGrath is a fertility expert and one of the founders of the
clinic, Women's Medical Arts. The series also stars Carmen
Argenziano, Laura Johnson, Darrell Larson, Ben Masters, Kate
Mulgrew, Julie Ronnie and Lynn Whitfield.
   ``Marilyn has a long-term relationship that was explored the
first season,'' Strickland said. ``She also has an estranged
daughter from an earlier marriage. The character was able to say a
few things about homosexuality that don't usually get said on the
air.
   ``She's accepted and respected by her peers. It hasn't been an
issue in the first six episodes we did. What's fun about the show is
that we're all different. We've all been defined in our goals and
how we relate to each other. The friendships we've developed with
the other actors I've noticed are showing up in the scripts as
friendships between the characters.''
   Strickland grew up in Birmingham, Ala., and went to school at
Florida State University at Tallahassee. ``My mother was determined
I would only go to college somewhere she could drive to,'' she said.
``I'd wanted to go to Sarah Lawrence or Northwestern. But I had a
good time.
   ``I didn't get into drama until my junior year. I was in
gymnastics and played the clown to amuse the audience while the
equipment was being set up. I developed a comedy routine that put my
life into jeopardy, because I wasn't very good at gymnastics. I
couldn't do a back flip off a trampoline, for instance, so they had
to catch me. I did a balancing act where they also had to catch me.
The audience thought it was just part of the act.''
   She learned to enjoy working before an audience, but after
graduation she took off for Europe and worked her way around the
Continent as a bartender, a governess and an extra in a Spanish
movie.
   In New York, she studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse and earned
her keep by doing commercials and soap operas.
   ``The first show I did when I moved to Los Angeles was `The Mary
Tyler Moore Show,''' she said. ``I thought they were all like that,
where the actor could make contributions and was welcomed and
appreciated. I haven't felt that much lately as a guest star, except

   Harlan County, an Appalachian coal town passed
by in the economic recovery of the Reagan years, hopes to move
beyond the stereotypes of poverty and strike violence when its
award-winning boys choir performs at the inauguration of George Bush
this week.
   ``We know how people perceive us, and we hope our offering will
allow us an opportunity to change that,'' choir director David
Davies said, adding that he thought ``it's only natural'' for
outsiders to buy the stereotypes about Appalachia.
   The community of 3,000 has reacted with pride to the 76-member
group's selection last month to be the lead choir for the
inauguration.
   ``It's been one of the biggest and best things that's happened to
the community,'' said Harlan County Judge-Executive Delzinna
Belcher. ``The choir is one of the good traditions that's just
particular to Harlan County.''
   Some people are wary that publicity about the choir may be
accompanied by yet another wave of stories about the troubles in the
region.
   ``Frankly, I'm sick and tired of people who are not from this
area making a two-hour visit or a four-day goodwill tour and then
thinking they're experts about our area and our culture,'' Ms.
Belcher said.
   But she is among the first to acknowledge the county faces some
tough problems.
   Unemployment remains in double digits, blamed on overproduction
and increased automation in the coal industry. Poor roads and
utility services hamper economic development efforts.
   The community has been plagued by the lingering memory of
violence associated with coal strikes in the 1930s and 1940s that
earned the town the name ``Bloody Harlan.''
   Ms. Belcher said she hoped the choir, which represents 25 percent
of the male students in the Harlan city school district, would
provide people across the country a positive image of the area that
might help offset the negatives.
   The Bush family selected the choir from a list of several groups
that were candidates for the honor, said Mike Ruehlig, a staff
member for a congressional inaugural committee.
   Davies said the choir would sing ``This Is My Country'' on the
platform on the front lawn of the U.S. Capitol minutes before Bush
is sworn in as the nation's 41st president.
   The choir director said he hoped people watching the inauguration
would be impressed with the group's musical abilities and
discipline. He said the inaugural performance would stand out in the
choir's 24-year history, which has included international trips and
numerous competition trophies.
   Roy Allison, an insurance agent who is the choir's business
coordinator, said the group is raising the $25,000 needed for the
trip through donations.
   Television crews have been in Harlan for the past two weeks, and
one morning network television show plans to feature the choir
during a program on the morning of the inauguration.
   ``We're getting used to the TV cameras,'' said choir member
Jeremy Disney, 12. ``It will help us. This might get us ready for
when we get to Washington.''

<HEAD>A Matter of Interest For Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When they do their income tax returns this year,
quite a few Americans might be prompted to think about changing
their borrowing habits.
   Time was when just about every cent of interest you paid was a
simple deductible expense, and the deduction helped reduce the cost
of credit. But those days are gone.
   In the aftermath of tax reform, there are five distinct
categories of interest expense, only one of which qualifies as fully
deductible without limits.
   And two people borrowing identical amounts of money at the same
nominal interest rate can wind up paying substantially different
after-tax amounts for their loans.
   Credit card payments, auto loans and other familiar types of
credit used by individuals to buy goods and services come under the
heading of consumer interest.
   For 1988, you can deduct 40 percent of the consumer interest you
paid. That drops to 20 percent in 1989, 10 percent in 1990 and
nothing in subsequent years.
   If you borrow to finance an investment, by contrast, the interest
remains deductible in amounts that don't exceed your investment
income by more than $2,000 for 1989.
   If you borrow against your primary or a second residence,
mortgage interest is still fully deductible up to the point where
the amount of the loan reaches $1 million. Similarly, interest can
be deducted on home equity loans of up to $100,000.
   Then there's category No. 4, ``passive activity'' interest, which
arises when you borrow to finance an investment such as a limited
partnership that operates a business in which you aren't an active
participant.
   This kind of interest was a prime target in the legislative
campaign against ``tax shelters.'' Rather than a deduction, it is
deemed part of the business's costs when its income or loss is
calculated.
   The only type of interest still deductible without exception is
interest paid by a trade or business.
   ``Clearly the least attractive type of interest expense is
consumer interest,'' says William Brennan, editor of the Financial
Planning Reporter newsletter at the accounting firm of Ernst &amp;
Whinney in Washington.
   ``If you have any spare cash, consider paying off consumer debt
immediately.''
   People who want or need to borrow, Brennan argues, should look
first to home equity loans if they have access to them, since home
equity loan interest still qualifies for a deduction.
   The main knock on home equity loans is that they expose a
precious asset to the threat of foreclosure if you can't keep up
timely payments on what you borrow. Also, all home equity loans are
not created equal _ some are loaded down with fees and charges that
make them more costly than they look.
   Still, says Brennan, the deduction can mean a significant
savings. On a consumer loan at 12 percent interest, a person in the
28 percent bracket pays an effective after-tax rate of 11.33 percent.
   With a home equity loan at the same 12 percent, that person pays
an effective after-tax rate of 8.64 percent.
   Suppose you lead a fairly complicated financial life, and have
interest payments that could conceivably fall into any one of
several categories. How do you tell what is what?
   That's most easily accomplished if you keep borrowed funds in an
account separate from your other money. If you put what you borrow
into, say, your regular checking account, you may well have trouble
establishing that you are paying anything other than consumer
interest.
   Observes Brennan, ``you can overcome this treatment by separating
borrowed funds from personal savings, and then using the borrowed
funds for purchases other than consumer items.''

<HEAD>Mercury Topaz a Sleeker Machine This Year</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thank heavens Ford saw fit to tweak the styling of its Ford Tempo
and Mercury Topaz cars. They have gone from blimpy jelly beans to
sleeker, more neatly packaged exteriors.
   Judging from last year's sales, American car buyers liked the
change, too. Topaz sales in 1988 rose 45 percent from 1987 levels,
to about 93,000, said company analyst Ray Windecker.
   Company spokesman Jim Trainor said Topaz sales of more than 7,600
last November set a monthly record. The Topaz sister car, the Ford
Tempo, also was up, with sales of about 280,000 in 1988 _ a 29
percent increase from 1987.
   Windecker and Trainor agreed the strong boost came mainly from
the new appearance. Starting in the 1988 model year, the vehicles
have taken styling cues from Ford's popular Taurus-Sable cars.
   The 1989 Mercury Topaz LS test car was a sturdy compact that took
little time getting used to. The Topaz hasn't changed much since its
introduction four years ago, so there wasn't an array of distracting
newfangled gadgets. The Topaz was just a car you could get into and
drive away.
   It offers sensible, day-to-day transportation. Don't look for
excitement.
   The 2.3-liter, four-cylinder engine _ in the Topaz since its
introduction _ seemed underpowered at times. Coupled with a
three-speed automatic transmission, it developed a maximum 100
horsepower at 4,400 rpm.
   But passing on the highway produced a loud whine under the Topaz
hood and a sluggish increase in speed. Speeding up in the city _ for
lane changes or whatever _ also was a bit disappointing.
   Still, Trainor noted that more power is not necessarily what the
average Topaz buyer wants, and the recent sales figures bear him
out. Price may be a factor in the Topaz purchase.
   The base price of the test Topaz was a little over $11,000
compared with a base price of $14,101 for the low-end Sable.
   The Topaz is between the Mercury Tracer and the Sable in the mix
of cars in Lincoln-Mercury dealerships, Trainor said, adding that
many buyers are looking for a good family car and thus opt for the
Topaz over the small Tracer.
   Topaz competitors include the Pontiac Grand Am and Chevrolet
Corsica, which start at around $11,000. Windecker said the Topaz has
an overall family image, with the median age of buyers at 44.4
years. Seventy-three percent are married, 50 percent are women, 21
percent are in professional-technical occupations, 12 percent are
office workers and 18 percent are retired. Median income is $33,000
annually.
   Besides the engine power, I had one other note about the Topaz.
Ford has installed automatic lap belts on the front seats. Though I
have driven other Ford cars with the belts, they seemed particularly
annoying in the Topaz, perhaps because the cloth seats also were
impossible to slide out of. As a result, I had to carefully plan how
to get out so my purse wouldn't keep getting hung up in the belts,
which automatically move towards the body when the key is turned in
the ignition and automatically move away when the door is opened.
   I don't even want to describe the scene when I lifted a small bag
of groceries out of the front seat. I finally started putting my
purse in the back seat and fetching it through a rear door after I
was out of the car.
   I also had a passenger who, unfamiliar with the belts, was hit in
the face by a belt when I started the car. The automatic shoulder
belts, by the way, still require manual attachment of the lap belts.
   Suspension in the Topaz was decent for a family car.
   There was lots of room in the trunk, though you have to lift
items up and over the car body in back before getting them into the
trunk.
   Seats were comfortable, and rear legroom was adequate.
   The all-wheel-drive option ($915) is chosen by just a small
percentage of Topaz buyers, Trainor said. But it really helped the
test car shine. Activated by a button above the rear-view mirror, it
performed well and was comforting on slick, snow-covered roads.
   Consumer Reports magazine says early models of the Topaz _ 1984
and 1985 _ ranked much worse than average in trouble reported by
owners. But later models _ 1986 and 1987 _ improved to average.

<HEAD>Summing Up Reagan's Impact on the United States</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After eight years of Ronald Reagan's presence
in the White House, the United States is enjoying prosperity _ but
not without worries.
   The government's debt has climbed from less than $1 trillion when
Reagan took office to more than $2.6 trillion. Most Americans pay
less income tax than when Reagan took office, but the overall
federal burden _ including Social Security taxes _ rose for the
poorest citizens. Despite his pledge to get government off the backs
of the citizens, Reagan made few inroads in his war against
government regulation.
   Reagan gave mixed signals on environmental controls, his record
ending largely in stalemate. The defense establishment grew
enormously. And the Reagan era ended the dream of home ownership for
millions. In one important area, Reagan's full impact is yet to be
felt _ the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary.
   Associated Press reporters who have covered these areas sum up
the Reagan impact:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Economy: 75 Months of Growth _ But Deficits Grew, Too</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   When Reagan leaves office, the U.S. economy will be in its 75th
month of expansion, a peacetime record, with the once-famous
``misery index'' far below where it was in Jimmy Carter's last days
in office.
   When Reagan was sworn in, the country was in the grips of its
worst economic predicament since the Great Depression, a
long-simmering bout of inflation fueled by successive oil shocks
that had sent consumer prices rising at double-digit rates.
   The misery index _ a number concocted by adding the inflation
rate and the unemployment rate _ climbed to a peak of 20.6 at the
end of the Carter years. As Reagan leaves office, the index is down
below 10 percent with the jobless rate at a 14-year low of 5.3
percent and inflation hovering slightly above 4 percent, about where
it has been for seven years.
   Reagan had a lot of help in the inflation fight from former
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, but he supported Volcker even
in the dark days of 1981-82 when the Fed's credit-tightening moves
plunged the country into its worst recession since the 1930s.
   After the downturn, the economy embarked on an expansion that has
lasted more than four times longer than the typical recovery,
creating more than 18 million jobs in the process.
   Critics contend that the rich received a disproportionate share
of the Reagan era prosperity.
   While the administration points to statistics showing that median
family incomes, after adjusting for inflation, climbed to a record
high of $30,853, the critics note that the 13.5 percent poverty rate
was higher than the levels recorded in the Carter, Ford and Nixon
administrations.
   The most lasting monuments of the Reagan economic policies may be
the twin debt mountains built by a near tripling in the national
debt and the country's slide from being the world's largest creditor
nation to the world's largest debtor nation, a development that
occurred because of the huge trade deficits.
   It is those debt burdens, critics say, that will haunt George
Bush and seriously constrain his maneuvering room during his
presidency.

<HEAD>Taxes: Down for Average American Family, But Not by Much</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans at all economic levels are paying less income tax
than they were when Reagan took office, but the total federal burden
on lower-income families has increased because of rising Social
Security taxes.
   ``The largest reductions between 1980 and 1988 will be for the 1
percent of families with the highest incomes,'' says the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office in summing up tax changes of the Reagan
era.
   Two far-reaching tax laws were enacted: the 1981 across-the-board
tax cut for individuals and corporations, and the 1986 overhaul that
slashed rates to the lowest levels in a half-century, eliminating or
reducing several deductions and shifting a big part of the tax
burden from individuals to business.
   In between and since those landmark acts, Congress and Reagan
agreed to more than a dozen tax increases _ most of them designed
chiefly to reduce the federal deficit _ which took back much of the
earlier tax cuts. Social Security taxes also went up.
   In estimating effects of all those tax changes, CBO divided
taxpayers into 10 groups (deciles) according to size of family
income. The first decil covered the 10 percent of families whose
incomes were lowest; the 10th decile covered the 10 percent with the
highest incomes. Here are some CBO findings:
   _The effective individual income tax rate dropped for all 10
groups from 1980 to 1988, but social insurance taxes _ mainly Social
Security _ rose for all 10. The income tax cut was not enough to
offset the Social Security tax increase for the poorer half of
families (earning less than $23,540).
   _The poorest decile (under $3,685 income) spent 9.6 percent of
their income on federal taxes in 1988, up from 6.6 percent in 1980.
Those in the sixth decile (averaging $29,660) paid 20.9 percent,
down from 21.4 percent. The richest 10 percent (averaging $125,800
income) paid 25 percent in 1988 and 27.1 percent in 1980.
   _American families on average in 1988 paid 22.7 percent of their
income in federal taxes (including Social Security, excise taxes and
all other federal taxes), down from 23.3 percent in 1980. Income
taxes alone averaged 10.4 percent, down from 12.3 percent
   _The share of total federal taxes paid by the richest 10 percent
of families rose by as much as 1.5 percentage points from 1980 to
1988. But their share of pre-tax income increased nearly twice as
much.

<HEAD>Defense: The Bill Comes to $2 Trillion</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   From higher salaries to stepped up weapons production to a search
for a ``Star Wars'' space shield, Reagan left an indelible mark on
America's military establishment.
   He also left a simmering fraud scandal that may tarnish
reputations in government and industry and reams of weapon-buying
orders without any money to back them up.
   By all Pentagon measures, the Navy, Marine Corps, Army and Air
Force are better prepared to fight than they were eight years ago.
The services have record percentages of high school graduates
manning the front lines and new tanks, guns, planes and ships for
them to use.
   Such gains were not made cheaply.
   So great was Reagan's military build-up that even allowing for
congressional cuts over the last four years, annual Pentagon
spending in terms of budget authority climbed from $213.8 billion in
fiscal 1982 to $290.8 billion in fiscal 1989.
   More significantly, the administration devoted a grand total of
$2.13 trillion to the Defense Department from the first full year of
Reagan's presidency through fiscal 1989, which began last Oct. 1.
   That total, which does not include Energy Department spending to
produce nuclear warheads, easily represents the largest peacetime
military build-up in American history. In fact, the build-up
approximates the amount of money spent on U.S. military forces in
the 10 years of American involvement in Vietnam.
   The $2.13 trillion of the Reagan years equals $2.39 trillion when
expressed in constant 1989 dollars, taking inflation into account.
From fiscal 1964 to fiscal 1973, the period of U.S. action in
Vietnam, the Pentagon received $2.46 trillion in 1989 dollars.
   Thanks to economic growth, the money spent on national defense
has declined in recent years as a percentageof the gross national
product _ it now stands at 5.9 percent.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and current defense
chief Frank C. Carlucci argue there's no link between the
government's booming deficit and the Pentagon budget.
   The money spent on the military has actually declined in recent
years as a percentage of the federal budget _ it's now 26.9 percent
_ meaning the deficit is being driven by increases in domestic
spending and entitlement programs, they claim.
   Congress however, appears loathe to cut deeply into domestic
programs. And with Soviet arms control proposals raising new hopes
for progress and President-elect Bush leaning toward zero growth in
the next Pentagon budget, the Reagan build-up may be done for good.

<HEAD>Housing: Decline of the American Homeownership Dream</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan years brought an end to the dream of home ownership
for millions of Americans and the nightmare of homelessness for
hundreds of thousands.
   Meanwhile, home values are skyrocketing in most areas, with the
median price ranging from $66,700 in the Midwest to $142,500 in the
Northeast. As Reagan leaves office, interest rates are also edging
up. Those trends have ended the house hunt for increasing numbers of
would-be home buyers.
   HUD's spending authority has declined by more than half during
Reagan's presidency. But Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Samuel R. Pierce Jr., who was the longest-serving and among the
least-visible of Reagan's Cabinet members, boasted that his agency
was ``taking care of more people by far, with much less money.''
   Among programs pushed by HUD are housing vouchers that allow poor
people to live anywhere rather than only in public housing and
reverse mortgages that would give ``house-rich and cash-poor''
elderly people income from the future sale of their homes without
having to give them up.
   But critics said cuts in housing and anti-poverty programs in
Reagan's presidency, combined with economic policies favoring the
well-off, have caused a crisis that poses a major challenge for the
new administration.
   In the cities, soup lines are getting longer and shelters more
crowded. Estimates of the number of homeless range from 250,000 to 3
million. Homelessness also has spread to the countryside, where
thousands live in everything from chicken coops to caves.
   The new homeless are not the drug abusers and mentally retarded
who have long slept in New York subways or on Washington street
grates, but young men with minimum-wage jobs and single women with
children.

<HEAD>The Fight Against Drugs: Battles Won, But Not the War</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration did much to focus attention on the
nation's drug problem and devoted substantial resources to combating
it, but the results of all that effort are mixed.
   The federal government is seizing more narcotics and making more
arrests than ever before, but drug use continues at high levels
across the country.
   A report issued by the Justice Department showed that in New York
City during a three-month voluntary survey in mid-1988, 90 percent
of the men arrested tested positive for a drug, up 11 percentage
points from the previous year. In Los Angeles, 77 percent of those
arrested tested positive, up from 69 percent the previous year.
   During the Reagan years, the Drug Enforcement Administration's
budget has increased by about 120 percent and arrests of major
violators have increased by 200 percent. Some $650 million in assets
were seized from drug traffickers in the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30, 1988.
   The nation's appetite for drugs manufactured in clandestine
laboratories has increased substantially, and the DEA
counter-attacked by putting hundreds of drug labs out of business
last year. New federal legislation gives the DEA tools to clamp down
on the export of U.S.-manufactured chemicals used in cocaine
processing.
   ``Our efforts have shown that coordinated law enforcement can
have an impact, but they've also shown that enforcement alone won't
adequately address the drug issue,'' DEA chief Jack Lawn said in an
interview last week.
   Pressing for reductions in the demand for drugs _ through Nancy
Reagan's ``Just Say No'' program and the myriad other efforts being
tried _ are vital pieces of the country's anti-drug efforts, said
Lawn.

   As a candidate in 1980, Reagan decried what he called a
half-century of judicial activism. He promised to appoint judges who
would not view themselves as social engineers.
   As Reagan leaves the presidency, a more conservative federal
judiciary is ``one of his more enduring legacies,'' says Vicki
Marani of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation.
   In eight years, Reagan filled about half of all current federal
judgeships. According to the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, he appointed 291 of 575 federal trial judges, and 89 of 168
appeals court judges. He also appointed three of the Supreme Court's
nine members.
   Compared to his most recent predecessors, Reagan appointed a
smaller percentage of women and minorities to the federal bench.
   ``His appointees generally have been white, pro-business, with
little respect for individual rights,'' says Nan Aron of the liberal
Alliance for Justice.
   Her organization, which has tracked Reagan's judicial selections,
says 2.1 percent of his appointments to the federal bench are black
and 3.4 percent are Hispanic. Women comprise 8.2 percent of the
Reagan judicial appointees.
   Among the 264 judges appointed by Jimmy Carter in his four-year
presidency, 14.3 percent were black, 6.2 percent were Hispanic and
15.5 percent were women.
   Reagan's appellate court appointments have been more closely
scrutinized by liberals and conservatives alike because the
administration wields more power in making those selections.
Traditionally, members of the Senate play the largest role in the
selection of federal trial judges.
   ``There's never been an administration in which the attorney
general (first William French Smith and then Edwin Meese III) took
such a personal interest in the selection of appellate judges,''
Aron says. ``There was always the singular objective of creating a
more conservative federal appellate bench, and a stringent
ideological test was applied.''
   Those who participated in the Reagan administration's judicial
selection process deny applying any such ideological test.
   But a recently completed study of each of the 12 federal
appellate courts throughout the nation by the American Lawyer
newspapers said, ``The president has transformed the circuit courts
by appointing a new breed of conservative judges _ mostly young,
rigorously intellectual and, critics charge, overly ideological _
who have exerted a dynamic influence on the appellate bench.''
   Aron, among those who concur in the ``overly ideological''
allegations, also agrees with the rest of the assessment.
   Marani says, ``I am aware of several studies, conducted by
liberals, showing a more conservative-leaning judiciary. The fact
that liberals are unhappy would give us cause for great
celebration.''

<HEAD>Deregulation: The Pendulum May Be Swinging the Other Way</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   When Reagan took the oath of office eight years ago, he promised
government would no longer ``ride on our back.'' But experts,
including his former top economic adviser, say he made few inroads
against the spread of government regulation.
   Reagan is leaving office with pressures mounting for new health,
safety and environmental regulations to address environmental
worries and the growing numbers of Americans with no health
insurance.
   ``I forecast that we're in the early stages of a new wave of
government intervention in the economy,'' said Murray Weidenbaum,
chairman of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers in 1981-82.
   The Federal Communications Commission has scaled back regulation
of radio and television broadcasting, including an end to the
``fairness doctrine.''
   The sweeping government deregulation of the airline industry
predated the Reagan administration, as did looser regulations of the
financial markets. The breakup of AT&amp;T was ordered by a federal
judge, not executive fiat. The trucking and rail industries remain
subject to extensive regulation.
   ``A lot of this stuff was really done before Reagan came in,''
said Clifford Winston, a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings
Institution. ``Actually, there's probably been a growth of the
environmental safety regulation during his time.''
   Jeffrey Eisenach, a Heritage Foundation fellow, said, ``The
Reagan administration's battle against excessive government
regulation proved ... even more difficult than expected.''
   ``The early Reagan deregulators ... could not have imagined some
of the obstacles that would be thrown into their path by Congress
and the courts,'' Eisenach wrote in Heritage's ``Mandate for
Leadership III'' study.
   Weidenbaum said the new Reagan administration rolled back some
``midnight rules issued by Carter,'' imposed benefit-cost reviews of
new regulations and strengthened the regulatory reform machinery at
the Office of Management and Budget.
   Bush, as vice president, headed a task force on regulatory reform
that prided itself on cutting red tape.
   But ``the effort lost steam,'' said Weidenbaum, a Washington
University professor and scholar at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, as top Reagan officials opted to concentrate
on cutting the budget and taxes, not deregulation.
   ``The two most notorious people in the administration identified
with regulation were Jim Watt (former Interior secretary) and Anne
Gorsuch Burford (former EPA director),'' said Weidenbaum. ``They
stirred up such a firestorm, it put us all on the defensive. The
second term was spent mending fences that were broken in the first
term.''
   But while the deregulatory drive may have lost some momentum,
Winston said, ``We're not going to set up the CAB (Civil Aeronautics
Board) again to decide what air fares are going to be.''

<HEAD>The Environment: Turmoil, Followed by Stalemate</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Though in the later years there were scattered actions praised by
environmentalists, notably the treaty reducing use of chemicals that
destroy the Earth's protective ozone layer, the Reagan
administration's record on the environment is largely a story of
stalemate.
   The treaty offers a precedent for tackling an issue that only now
is reaching the spotlight _ the global warming of the ``greenhouse
effect'' produced by burning fossil fuels.
   Overall, the environmental report card is mixed. The
administration, after initially favoring inaction, sharply reduced
emissions of lead to the atmosphere from gasoline. Urban smog,
though, remains a mess for more than 107 cities more than a year
past the deadline for meeting clean air standards and Congress has
not decided what to do next.
   Water pollution cleanup remains uneven, with fouled beaches in
the headlines and more and more discoveries of groundwater
contamination.
   Cleanup of toxic waste dumps under the ``Superfund,'' program, a
$1.5-billion-a-year effort now, is painfully slow, expensive and
controversial. Only a handful have been completed.
   As a society, ``We have misused the opportunities that presented
themselves'' in the last eight years, said Peter A.A. Berle,
president of the National Audubon Society.
   But Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and
Conservation Association, said of the environmental community, ``We
have hung the noose around ourselves.
   ``We as leaders of the environmental community should not endorse
presidential candidates,'' he said, referring to the 1980 Rose
Garden appearance of many of those leaders endorsing Jimmy Carter as
individuals.
   Reagan came to office after scorning environmentalist positions,
noting that trees pollute _ which is a fact. Environmentalists
returned the scorn with jokes about ``killer trees.''
   One of the new administration's first acts was to cut the White
House Council on Environmental Quality from 50 positions to eight.
   Reagan's choice to head the Enviromental Protection Agency, Anne
Burford, didn't even arrive at the agency until four months after
the inauguration and gave the impression she believed the
bureaucracy was the enemy.
   She didn't know Washington. She accepted savage cuts from the
Office of Management and Budget, at first not fighting for funds.
She rarely consulted members of Congress or had environmentalists in
her office.
   Loyal to the president, she withheld documents from Congress on
his instructions over her own misgivings. She fired the assistant
administrator in charge of the Superfund, Rita Lavelle, for lying.
When the smoke cleared, Mrs. Burford had been eased out and Ms.
Lavelle was in prison, convicted of lying to Congress, too.
   The first interior secretary, James Watt, was convinced that
overblown environmental worries were locking away valuable
resources. Watt, almost the embodiment of the ``Sagebrush
Rebellion'' resentment of federal control of western lands, was
determined to unlock them and to taunt environmentalists, too.
   After Watt, the sagebrush rebellion petered out, according to
some analysts, under recognition by Washington's Western critics
that they benefitted from federally subsidized electricity, grazing
rights, irrigation water and timber sales.

<TEXT>
   Four years after record-breaking cold forced an
indoor inaugural, George Bush must cope with the vagaries of
Washington weather in planning for his presidential oath-taking.
   Bush's inaugural committee is making contingency plans, including
a swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, in the event of
weather disruptions.
   While meteorologists say it is too soon to make a prediction for
Friday, Inauguration Day, the 30-day weather forecast for Washington
in January called for a 55 percent chance of above normal
temperatures and dryer than normal conditions for the month.
   Does that mean Bush's inauguration won't be plagued by a driving
rain like that which nearly washed away Franklin D. Roosevelt's
second swearing-in, in 1937?
   Or a snowstorm such as nearly buried William Howard Taft in 1909?
   Or perhaps a raw, cloudy day like that in 1841 when William Henry
Harrison took office without hat or overcoat? Harrison caught a cold
that turned into pneumonia, killing him after but a month in office.
   President Reagan's 1985 inaugural ceremonies were moved inside
when 10-degree temperatures and winds of 17 mph put the wind chill
factor at 16 below zero.
   Such history notwithstanding, a study of climate shows the
Washington weather on Jan. 20 is often, but not always, mild.
   Weather historian Patrick Hughes details the effects of the
elements on inaugurations in the December issue of ``Weatherwise''
magazine. In his study he notes that average weather for the date is
44 degrees Fahrenheit, and normally only enough rain or snow falls
to wet the pavement.
   The date for the inauguration was changed in the 1930s, when it
was moved up from March 4. Jan. 20 was picked after a study of
weather records showed it to be usually mild, for that time of year.
   Roosevelt's wet and chilled ceremony in 1937 was the first to be
held in January, and criticism promptly followed.
   Sen. George W. Norris of Nebraska, who spearheaded the change,
warned critics to wait until March 4 to see what the weather would
be like then, before criticizing him for the change.
   ``It was, of course, a beautiful day _ sunny with a high
temperature of 67 degrees, unusually warm for that date,'' Hughes
observes.
   Perhaps the most practical approach to inaugural weather came
from Harry S. Truman. Upon receiving a formal invitation to his own
swearing-in ceremony, Truman wrote across it: ``Weather Permitting,
I hope to be present.'' It was a chilly 38 degrees and windy that
day, but the sun was out and Truman was there.
   Official weather records were not kept at the time, but
historians recorded it as a cool and clear day in New York City when
George Washington became the first president on April 30, 1789.
   Four years later the event was moved to Philadelphia and to March
4, as determined by Congress, and the weather was listed as
``pleasant'' for the start of Washington's second term. It was
``fair'' in the City of Brotherly Love when John Adams took office
in 1797.
   After that the ceremonies moved to the new capital city,
Washington, where it was ``mild and beautiful'' for Thomas Jefferson
in 1801 and ``fair'' for the start of his second term in 1895.
   James Madison's two terms both started in weather listed by
historians as ``probably fair.''
   Here is a rundown of subsequent presidents and the weather
attending their inaugurations, as recorded in the book ``American
Weather Stories:``
   _James Monroe, warm and sunny in 1817, snow and 28 degrees in
1821.
   _John Quincy Adams, 47 degres and rain, 1825.
   _Andrew Jackson, warm and balmy in 1829, probably fair in 1833.
   _Martin Van Buren, sunny and brisk in 1837.
   _William Henry Harrison, overcast with a chilling wind, 1841.
   _James K. Polk, rain in 1845.
   _Zachary Taylor, 42 degrees and cloudy with occasional snow
flurries, 1849.
   _Franklin Pierce, snow throughout the day in 1853.
   _James Buchanan, 1857, bright and sunny, 49 degrees.
   _Abraham Luncoln, 1861, rain until midmorning then turning sunny
and warm; 1865, rain and 45 degrees.
   _Ulysses S. Grant, 1869, 40 degrees and light rain in morning,
sunny in afternoon; 1873 clear, windy and bitterly cold, 16 degrees.
   _Rutherford B. Hayes, 35 degrees and cloudy in 1877, with brief
periods of light snow.

sunny and windy later.
   _Grover Cleveland, 1885, 54 degrees, bright and sunny; 1893, 25
degrees, snow and chilling winds.

   _William Howard Taft, 1909, heavy snow and strong winds, 32
degrees.

   In its final report to Reagan, the president's Council of

<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys for GAF Corp. and a senior
company officer fighting stock manipulation charges have seized on
the declaration of a mistrial as grounds to have the entire
indictment dismissed.
   If they succeed, it would mark a major defeat for prosecutors
because the GAF trial marks the first important case arising from
the Wall Street corruption scandal to reach the trial phase.
   It has been seen as a key test of the government's ability to
persuade a jury of criminal charges resulting from the scandal,
which is now more than two years old.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe's mistrial ruling Tuesday
stunned a packed courtroom and came after the defense challenged the
government prosecutor's handling of an important piece of evidence
and said it had unfairly hurt their case.
   Lowe dismissed the jurors, apologizing one month into a trial
that has attracted widespread attention. The judge said she intended
to start picking a jury for a new trial later in the week.
   Defense attorneys then requested dismissal of the entire
indictment, arguing the government is constitutionally barred from
bringing two actions against a defendant for the same charges.
   After Lowe rejected their request, the defense attorneys filed an
intention to appeal to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, but it was
unclear late Tuesday whether the higher court would grant their
request for a hearing.
   ``We're appealing on grounds that the law says you don't have to
wear the same wet bathing suit twice,'' Arthur Liman, the lead
lawyer for GAF and one of the most prominent defense attorneys in
the country, told reporters.
   Liman and Stephen Kaufman, attorney for GAF vice chairman James
T. Sherwin, said they had no other option than to request a mistrial
because of a controversy about an invoice the government had
introduced to support its charges of stock manipulation.
   After defense attorneys challenged the invoice's authenticity
during testimony last week, prosecutor Carl Loewenson acknowledged
he had failed to provide them with a report indicating the evidence
may have been tampered with.
   Loewenson called the error an act of carelessness that would not
affect the trial. But the judge said under strict rules of
evidence-gathering, the prosecutor was obligated to share such
information with the defense attorneys, who claimed they would have
altered their strategy had they known about it.
   The government minimized the significance of the mistrial, which
coincided with the announcement that U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.
Giuliani _ the leader of a major crackdown on Wall Street corruption
_ will resign at the end of the month after more than five years of
service.
   ``This is not a last-minute slap in the face,'' Giuliani told a
news conference. ``We can't criticize her (Lowe's) decision,
although we would have preferred to go forward with the case.''
   Legal experts said they doubted the GAF defense team would
succeed in getting the indictment thrown out by an appeals court,
which ordinarily grants wide discretionary powers to lower-court
judges who declare mistrials.
   ``It sounds like the defense is doing what it has to do, leaving
no stone unturned, to get the maximum benefit out of it,'' said
Gerard Lynch, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York.
   GAF and Sherwin were indicted in July on charges they attempted
to manipulate up the value of Union Carbide Corp. stock in late 1986
after a failed takeover attempt of the larger company. The alleged
motive was to maximize the gain GAF would realize from the sale of
its stake in Carbide.
   Evidence for the indictment has been supplied largely by
securities trader Boyd L. Jefferies, who claimed his Los Angeles
brokerage was utilized by GAF to conduct manipulative trades in
Carbide stock to inflate the price.
   Jefferies, an admitted felon who has not been sentenced, is a
leading government witness in at least three major securities-fraud
prosecutions.
   He was implicated by Ivan F. Boesky, the notorious insider trader
who turned state's evidence in late 1986. Boesky is now serving a
three-year federal prison term.

   As R.P. Scherer Corp. officials consider selling
the gelatin capsule manufacturer, one offer to buy could come from
former president Peter R. Fink.
   Fink, who resigned as president and chief executive officer in
November after a losing proxy fight against his estranged wife and
other heirs of the company founder who want to sell, said Tuesday he
has started his own investment company.
   Quantum Corp., with Fink as president, was not established
specifically to buy Scherer, Fink said.
   ``However, at this point, I would not rule out participation in
an endeavor of that type,'' he said.
   Fink remains a Scherer board member, and said that in that
capacity he would encourage consideration of an offer from Quantum,
``if the circumstances were appropriate.''
   Scherer spokeswoman Jayne A. Colombo said company officials would
not comment on the formation of Quantum or the possibility of an
acquisition attempt.
   The Scherer board has voted to consider alternatives such as
selling all or part of the company, a management buyout, a
recapitalization or a merger. The board has hired Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co., to evaluate alternatives.
   Board members include Karla Fink _ Peter Fink's estranged wife
and the daughter of R.P. Scherer, the company's founder _ and her
brother, John S. Scherer. Between them, the two control about 38
percent of the company.
   Karla Fink led the dissident shareholders ``Committee for the
Sale of R.P. Scherer Corp.,'' which successfully backed the election
in an Aug. 17 proxy vote of two new board members who also want to
consider selling the company.
   Fink said his new company will evaluate a range of investment
opportunities and also offer management services for businesses.
   He was president of Travco Corp., a maker of fiberglass products,
before his association with R.P. Scherer, and before that was
president and treasurer of Data Systems Inc., a computer
manufacturer.

<HEAD>Kohl Calls For Reasonable Solution in Trade Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Wednesday called for a reasonable solution to a trade dispute
between the European Economic Community and the United States over a
ban on the imports of American hormone-treated beef.
   ``Both sides should resolve their problems in a reasonable way in
the spirit of trans-Atlantic partnership and aware of their
responsibility for the world economy,'' Kohl told reporters at a
news conference in Bonn.
   The EEC ban on U.S. beef produced from cattle that had been fed
growth hormones took effect on Jan. 1.
   The United States retaliated with punitive tariffs on several
European products.
   ``Such trade conflicts can only hurt both sides economically and
politically,'' Kohl said.
   He said such disputes give a ``completely false signal'' for a
meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that will be
held in April and for the world economic summit scheduled this
summer.
   Kohl did not suggest any possible solutions to the beef dispute.
   He pledged strong support for the 12 European nations' efforts to
forge a single European market by the end of 1992.
   ``We've reached the point of no return; the target date will be
met,'' Kohl said, adding that West Germany will make every effort to
assist Spain and France, which hold the rotating EEC presidency this
year, in pushing through important decisions that have to be made.
   Kohl said agreement has to be reached before the end of 1990 on
tax harmonization, on the so-called ``social dimensions'' of the
internal market, on a joint monetary policy and on the ways and
means of coping with the security effect of open borders.
   He said those decisions have to be made well before 1992 to allow
individual nations to adapt domestic legislation to EEC changes.
   Kohl said that Europe will not turn into a protectionist
``fortress,'' once internal borders are eliminated. He stressed that
West Germany, as the world's largest exporter, is well aware of the
need for free trade and will strongly promote an EEC-wide free-trade
approach.

<HEAD>Ad Magazine Suggests Dropping `Heartbeat' Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevrolet should dump its ``Heartbeat of America''
campaign in favor of a new ticker, Adweek says.
   The advertising trade magazine placed the campaign at the top of
its ``Worst in the Midwest'' in this week's issue. It was one of 19
recipients in the magazine's Seventh Annual Badvertising Awards of
1988.
   ``Prognosis? Hearbeat'll be history in '89,'' the magazine said.
``We're in the third year of `Heartbeat;' is there a cardiologist in
the house?''
   The advertising agency that developed the award-winning campaign
wasn't amused.
   ``I think that's nonsense,'' said Dick O'Connor, chairman of
Lintas: Campbell-Ewald in Warren. ``They're entitled to their
opinion and they can print what they want, but facts are facts and
the fact is, Chevy is coming on strong.''
   O'Connor said the 3-year-old campaign, which has won more than
100 awards, including the Clio, the Oscar of the ad industry, would
not be dropped this year.
   Heading the list in the magazine's Badvertising awards were last
year's presidential campaigns.
   ``As the self-professed candidates of competence, Michael Dukakis
staked his hopes on some conspicuously incompetent advertising,''
the magazine said of the Democratic nominee's ads.
   ``The `kinder, gentler' George Bush was making Willie Horton (the
prison furlough rapist) a household name,'' Adweek said of the Bush
campaign.
   Other ads singled out by the magazine included campaigns from
Scotch Tape, Surf Detergent and Calvin Klein's Eternity.

   The stock market was mixed today, leveling off
after Tuesday's modest pullback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.58 to 2,196.79 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers held a slight edge on gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 426 up, 440 down and 536
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.24 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In each of the past four sessions the Dow Jones industrial
average has crossed 2,200 and then retreated again.
   Analysts said that repeated pattern had disappointed some traders
hoping to see the average climb to fresh new highs since the October
1987 crash.
   Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said technical
analysis did not show any particular significance to the 2,200
level, which the market passed easily in early 1987 and which showed
no sign of support in the collapse later that year.
   ``But in a struggling advance, a round number often represents a
psychological barrier,'' Zinder observed.
   Polaroid rose } to 37\ in active trading. Shamrock Holdings,
which is making a hostile $42-a-share bid for the company, said the
Delaware Supreme Court granted it an expedited appeal on a court
decision relating to the bid.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.13 to 157.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .11 at 312.84.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.25 to 2,193.21.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 622 up, 793 down and 536 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 140.42 million shares, down from 163.18
million in the previous session.

   Centaur Partners said its $765 million cash offer
for chemical manufacturer Pennwalt Corp., scheduled to expire at
midnight tonight, was being extended two weeks to midnight on Jan.
25.
   Centaur also said Wednesday it was voluntarily submitting
unaudited financial information on itself and some of its limited
partners to the Securities and Exchange Commission, even though it
maintained the disclosure was not required by securities laws.
   Pennwalt had complained to the SEC that Centaur had not released
enough information about its financial standing. The principal
partners in Centaur are New York financiers Abbey J. Butler and
Melvyn J. Estrin.
   Centaur owns about 1 million or 12.7 percent of Pennwalt's 7.89
million outstanding shares and has made a tender offer to
shareholders to acquire the rest of the company at $100 a share.
That would come to about $690 million, not counting fees and other
expenses that could bring the cost of the deal to $765 million,
Centaur said.

<HEAD>Cetus Announces New Deal With Hoffmann-La Roche</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cetus Corp., which recently settled a
question over patent rights with Hoffmann-La Roche, has reached a
multimillion dollar agreement with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant to
collaborate on the development and marketing of diagnostic tests
using Cetus' ``gene amplification'' technique.
   Cetus President Robert Fildes said Tuesday that his firm, based
in Emeryville, Calif., and Hoffman-La Roche have agreed not to
reveal the financial aspects of the five-year agreement, which
represents ``many millions of dollars.''
   Fildes said increased demand for diagnostic kits is expected to
create a $500 million to $600 million market by the middle of the
next decade.
   Last month, Cetus avoided a legal fight with the Swiss company
over patent rights by reaching a cross-licensing agreement on the
cancer fighting agent interleukin-2, Cetus' most important product.
Cetus agreed to pay Hoffmann-La Roche royalties on future sale of
the drug, and Hoffmann-La Roche said it would buy up to 7 percent of
Cetus' shares for $30 million.
   Under the latest agreement, Hoffman-La Roche will finance
development of the diagnostic tests using Cetus' GeneAmp polymerase
chain reaction, or PCR, technology. It also will pay Cetus an
undisclosed royalty on sales.
   The GeneAmp PRC process was developed by Cetus, and allows gene
sequences to be replicated millions of times. The technology has
helped the company develop accurate testing in the areas of genetic
disorders, cancer and infectious diseases.

   The parents of a 14-year-old say they
will keep their daughter at home despite the threat of jail for
violating a local ban on children under 15.
   ``I can't shoot her. It's as simple as that,'' Beverly Elmer said
in response to a judge's threat last week to jail her and her
husband for 10 days if daughter Staci Lynn isn't out of their
double-wide mobile home by Jan. 20.
   ``They don't like me,'' Staci said of the subdivision residents
who sued the Elmers. ``They're just mean. They don't like any
children.''
   The case mirrors one in Margate, Fla., where directors of an
adults-only condominium have been trying to evict 9-year-old Jamie
Swartz, who moved in with her father while her mother was dying of
cancer.
   The condominium directors voted last week to allow Jamie to stay
until March, when a housing law goes into effect that could nullify
child-exclusion deeds.
   In the Zephyrhills case, Circuit Judge Wayne L. Cobb said he had
no choice but to enforce the order.
   ``It's incomprehensible, a bunch of people who don't want
youngsters around,'' Cobb said. ``I don't understand why anybody,
period, would want to live in a place that didn't allow kids.''
   Mrs. Elmer said she and her husband, Thomas, don't have money to
rent another house while they try to sell their home, situated about
15 miles from Tampa. They say their mortgage doesn't permit them to
rent the home if they move.

<HEAD>State Agencies Clear The Way For Banks To Sell Insurance Under Prop.
103</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two state agencies have cleared the way for
banks to sell insurance for the first time in California as called
for by the voter-approved insurance reform initiative Proposition
103, officials said.
   But attorneys for the state's largest association of insurance
agents vowed Tuesday to challenge the decision in court.
   State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie and state Bank
Superintendent Howard Gould both issued recent rulings saying
Proposition 103 effectively repeals all state laws keeping banks out
of the insurance business.
   In a letter to the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of
California, Mrs. Gillespie said she and Gould rejected the agents'
argument that the banks are still barred from selling insurance
because Proposition 103 didn't explicitly repeal two provisions in
the financial code regulating banks.
   The agents argued that Proposition 103's wording aimed at
repealing provisions in the insurance code forbidding such sales
couldn't be applied to the banking codes.
   But Gould released a bulletin saying, ``The Banking Department
considers that the Financial Code restrictions ... are repealed by
implication with the passage of Proposition 103, and has prepared a
legal opinion to that effect.''
   The commissioner also denied a request for a public hearing on
the dispute.
   ``We are disappointed with Mrs. Gillespie's refusal to hold a
hearing and her decision to defer to the Banking Department's
opinion,'' said the agents' legal counsel, Stephen Young. ``We do
not agree with their reasoning.''
   About half of the banks in California, those possessing state
charters, are affected by Proposition 103. Allowing these banks to
sell insurance has long been a goal of insurance reformers trying to
boost competition and cut prices in the insurance business.
   Insurance companies are challenging the constitutionality of
Proposition 103 in the state Supreme Court. The high court has
allowed most of the ballot initiative to become law pending its
review. The proposition's provision calling for a 20 percent
rollback in insurance rates has not been put into effect, however.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said today the
United States has undergone ``a revolution in smoking behavior'' in
the last 25 years, but young people are continuing to take up the
habit and women are quitting at a slower rate than men.
   Koop, speaking at a news conference where he issued the surgeon
general's latest annual report on smoking, said smoking rates are
also higher among blacks, blue-collar workers and less educated
people.
   ``Because more than 50 million Americans continue to smoke and
because of the residual increased risk of death and disease in
ex-smokers, smoking remains the most important preventable cause of
death in our society,'' he said.
   ``Smoking is responsible for more than one of every six deaths in
the United States,'' he said.
   ``It's no exaggeration to say that a revolution in smoking
behavior has occurred,'' Koop said. ``The gains we have made in
curtailing the use of cigarettes in the United States represent one
of the greatest public health achievements of all time.''
   However, he said that if current smoking trends among women
continue, ``women will be smoking at higher rates than men beginning
in the mid-1990s.''
   In addition, he said, ``smoking among high school seniors has
leveled off in recent years after previous years of decline.''
   ``I think some of the worrisome news is that it's continuing to
decline but at a much slower rate among women. And the big thing is
that ... young kids are continuing to start almost as much as they
were 10, 20 years ago,'' Dr. Patrick Remington of the Wisconsin
Division of Health, one of the authors of the report, said on ``CBS
This Morning.''
   One factor in women's smoking, he said, is that ``risk-taking
behavior over the last 20 years, especially among young women, has
become more common. And cigarette-smoking is one risk-taking
behavior.''
   Anti-smoking campaigns have been most successful in getting white
men to put out their cigarettes, and the report calls for more
efforts aimed at women, children, minorities and high school
dropouts who are not quitting as quickly.
   The annual report, issued Tuesday by Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop on the 25th anniversary of the government's first such report,
says the proportion of American smokers has declined from 40 percent
of the population in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987.
   ``These changes represent nothing less than a revolution in
behavior,'' Koop said in the report. ``Thanks to the remarkable
progress of the past 25 years, we can dare to envision a smoke-free
society.''
   However, he said, ``smokers are disproportionately found in
groups that are harder to reach, and this disparity may increase
over time. Greater effort and resources will need to be devoted to
achieve equivalent reductions in smoking among those whose behavior
has survived strong, countervailing pressures.''
   The 700-page report documents changes in the 25 years since the
surgeon general's initial declaration that cigarette smoking leads
to cancer and other serious diseases.
   The most significant shift has come among men _ half of whom
smoked in 1965, according to the report. By 1987, less than a third
were lighting up.
   Women smokers declined from 32 percent to 27 percent over the
period, the report said.
   The figures also show a slow decline among blacks, 43 percent to
34 percent, and virtually no change among those who never graduated
from high school, 37 percent to 36 percent.
   Among high school seniors, daily cigarette smoking dropped from
29 percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980 and then leveled off in the
18-21 percent range for the seven years after that.
   Since 1977, prevalence of smoking among high school senior girls
has been greater than that among boys of that age.
   Among the other findings of the report:
   _Nearly 45 percent of American adults who ever smoked have quit,
though the ``quit ratio'' does not take into account the length of a
quitter's abstinence.
   _Smoking is responsible for more than one of every six deaths in
the United States and ``remains the single most important
preventable cause of death in our society.''
   _Between 1964 and 1987, some 789,000 smoking-related deaths were
avoided or postponed as a result of decisions to quit smoking or not
to start, which the report attributes to the anti-smoking campaign.
   _Four-fifths of smokers born since 1935 started smoking before
age 21, and the proportion of people who begin smoking during
adolescence has been increasing, particularly among women. A quarter
of high school seniors who have ever smoked had their first
cigarette by sixth grade and half by eight grade.
   _The number of legal restrictions on children's access to tobacco
products has decreased over the past 24 years, and ``vendor
compliance with minimum-age-of-purchase laws is the exception rather
than the rule.''
   The first surgeon general's report concluded narrowly that
smoking increases deaths among men and causes lung and laryngeal
cancer in men and chronic bronchitis in men and women.
   Surgeon general reports since then have concluded that smoking
increases deaths among men and women and causes lung and laryngeal
cancer in both. The reports over the years also have tied smoking to
heart disease, atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and low birthweight babies as well as
cancers of the mouth, esophagus, bladder, kidney and stomach, cervix
and pancreas.

<TEXT>
   Wheat and corn futures prices opened slightly
lower while soybean futures were narrowly mixed in early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a lack of significant new
supply-and-demand developments.
   Analysts said the mixed soybean market reflected mixed weather
conditions in the South American soybean belt. Scattered showers
continued in Brazil but Argentina remained mostly dry.
   Wheat futures continued to retreat from last week's 7{-year highs
due to a slowdown in U.S. export sales and growing expectations
among traders of a sharp increase in wheat planting after last
year's drought.
   ``Everybody's looking at the current price level and saying we
will have 15 percent to 20 percent more wheat acreage,'' said Walter
Spilka, a grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
in New York.
   The Agriculture Department will announce 1988-89 U.S. winter
wheat acreage in a report to be released Friday afternoon. The
report also will contain new estimates of the nation's grain and
soybean surplus and the final 1988 crop production figures.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.46{ a bushel; corn was { cent
to 1 cent lower with March at $2.88{ a bushel; oats were } cent
lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.39\ a bushel; soybeans were
{ cent lower to 2{ cents higher with January at $8.05 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February
at 74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .37 cent lower
with January at 84.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .27
cent lower with February at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to .58 cent higher with February at 42.70 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures closed higher on Tuesday while pork futures
finished mixed.

   Forty-two years after giving a friend a
bag of clay to try in her cat box, Ed Lowe has become a celebrity of
sorts, his white-bearded, grandfatherly image recognized by millions
of feline fanciers.
   The inventor of cat box filler obtained a trademark for ``Kitty
Litter'' back then, but only within the last two years has his face
begun appearing on the packaging.
   Now, people occasionally stop the 68-year-old Lowe on the street
_ but not always to ask about him.
   ``One day I was walking down the street and this guy walked by
and looked at me and asked, `How's Ugh?''' Lowe said, referring to
his pet cat who appeared with him on television commercials. ``So I
guess they know Ugh better than they know me.''
   The self-made millionaire doesn't mind the attention. In fact, he
relishes making the most of his caring image as ``the man who
brought the cat in from the cold.''
   A new cat food expected on supermarket shelves in February or
March _ the first for Edward Lowe Industries Inc. _ also will bear
his picture.
   ``We're going to promote the character of Ed Lowe a little more,
because no one else can do that,'' Lowe said during an interview at
the 3,000-acre farm in southwestern lower Michigan, where he lives
and conducts business as chairman and chief executive officer of the
company he founded.
   Two cats roam the offices, which resemble a tasteful country inn
more than the headquarters of a company with annual revenues of $150
million. Sales offices are located about 20 miles away in South
Bend, Ind.
   Lowe, dressed in corduroys, a red sweater and matching bandana,
drinks coffee from a cat coffee mug and is surrounded by a host of
cat sculptures, paintings _ even a stuffed toy cat that moves its
head.
   More than a hundred cats are housed in Lowe's cat care center,
where cat box filler and food preference are studied. The cats are
kept either individually in small, glass-enclosed rooms or in groups
of 10 or 20 in larger rooms, where behavior is monitored.
   Despite appearances, Lowe says he's never been crazy about cats _
especially when he gave out that first bag of clay.
   ``I didn't dislike them,'' Lowe said. ``I wasn't and I'm still
not a fanatic about any pet.''
   Chickens were on Lowe's mind in 1946 when he began trying to
market granulated clay to poultry farmers as a nesting material.
When Chicken Litter failed to catch on, Lowe returned to his
father's sawdust business in Vandalia, Mich., which sold the
absorbent clay to soak up oil and grease.
   On a cold day in January 1947, a friend of Lowe's, Kay Draper,
approached him for some sand for her cat box. Because all the sand
at the sawdust business had frozen, Lowe instead gave her a bag of
the clay.
   Word spread, and before long Lowe was peddling his Kitty Litter
from the trunk of his '43 Chevy to pet shops and at cat shows across
the country.
   ``If I hadn't seen Kay that day, I'd still be shoveling
sawdust,'' Lowe says with a laugh.
   For more than 10 years, Lowe was alone in the cat litter business.
   Today, Lowe Industries is the leader in what has grown to be a
$600 million industry. Between Kitty Litter, which retails for $1.89
for an eight-pound bag, and his less expensive cat box filler, Tidy
Cat, Lowe says he controls about 40 percent of the market.
   He employs 500 people at five plants in Missouri, Illinois,
California and Tennessee _ where clay deposits are plentiful.
   Despite his success, Lowe still fights the use of Kitty Litter as
a generic term.
   ``I have the same problem as Kleenex. You just gotta keep
fighting it,'' Lowe says. However, he calls the dilemma ``a joyful
problem. I would rather have it that way than not have it at all.''
   Lowe hopes to advance that cause by putting his face on all of
his products. He also hopes that by familiarizing consumers with his
picture he will capture their trust.
   He wants to become to cat box filler what Colonel Sanders is to
fried chicken and Orville Redenbacher is to popcorn.
   Though corporate strategy is to promote a gentle, grandfatherly
image, Lowe isn't shy about taking credit for establishing an
industry. He figures the hugely competitive cat food business and
veterinary practices are outgrowths of his product.
   ``I think that I've made the cat popular,'' Lowe says. ``You
wouldn't be able to own a cat if you didn't have Kitty Litter.''
   Lowe also has started a foundation at his farm to support
partnership programs for owners of family and independent businesses.
   ``Building a foundation allows you to go on forever and my
mission is to help entrepreneurs,'' Lowe said.
   ``This property will be given to the foundation when I go to the
great cat box in the sky.''

<HEAD>Warner Completes Merger with Lorimar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. said today that it had
completed its long-delayed, $1.2 billion merger with
Lorimar-Telepictures Corp. in the wake of Lorimar's sale of the last
of its television stations.
   The merger of the two entertainment concerns had been delayed
since last fall because of a court ruling that prohibited Warner
from proceeding with the deal until Lorimar sold its television
stations.
   On Tuesday, Lorimar completed the sale of the last of its
stations, WPGH in Pittsburgh, clearing the way for completion of the
merger with Warner.
   Under terms of the merger agreement, Lorimar becomes a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Warner and each share of Lorimar stock
has been converted into the right to receive .3675 of a share on
Warner stock.
   Lorimar had about 46 million shares of common stock outstanding
as of last October, which could be converted into about 17 million
shares of Warner stock. At Warner's closing price of $37.12{ a share
on Tuesday, the swap would be worth about $630 million.
   In addition, Warner would assume Lorimar's debt of about $600
million, boosting the effective value of the entire transcation to
about $1.2 billion.
   In mid-morning trading today on the New York Stock Exchange,
Warner was up 50 cents a share at $37.62{.
   Lorimar, based in Culver City, Calif., is a major producer of
television programming including the shows ``Dallas'' and ``Alf.''
   Warner, based in New York, is a leading producer of movies,
television shows and recorded music and has interests in cable
operations.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures opened higher today, partly in
response to a nationwide shutdown of Mexico's refinery operations by
striking union workers.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gasoline prices shot up as
much as 0.79 cent a gallon before midday pulling crude prices up
with them. The February contract for crude oil was up 18 cents at
$17.87 a barrel.
   Analysts said the stronger prices partially reflected investor
concern that the disruption in Mexican refinery operations could
mean lower U.S. supplies. The striking workers are protesting the
arrest of their union boss on gun-running charges.
   ``The U.S. doesn't get that many oil imports from Mexico. The
concern is that we might move production into Mexico,'' said Andrew
Lebow, senior broker and analyst for E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc.
   Today's rise in oil prices also resulted from Tuesday's American
Petroleum Institute report showing that crude oil inventories
declined sharply last week, analysts said.
   On Tuesday, the February contract for West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled 3 cents lower at
$17.69 a barrel after having been down as much as 25 cents during
the session. On Monday, the February contract closed 17 cents higher
at $17.72 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, domestic heating
oil futures ended mixed, with the February contract settling at
53.86 cents a gallon, down 0.29 cent.
   Unleaded gasoline futures also closed mixed, with the February
contract down 0.05 cent at 47.91 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said prices were dragged down by profit-taking. Energy
analysts said investors decided to take advantage of steadily rising
prices and began a round of heavy selling early in the day.
   Prices later recovered most of their losses on reports that
non-OPEC oil producing countries were preparing to announce
production cutbacks to help bolster the recent accord among members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute
reported that for the week ended Jan. 6, crude oil stocks fell by
5.5 million barrels, to 328.86 million barrels. Gasoline supplies
increased by 531,000 barrels to 229.1 million and heating oil stocks
were up 726,000 to 127.5 million barrels.
   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the API report would probably
send crude futures higher.
   ``Many people were expecting a buildup of as high as 7 million
barrels of crude so the API report will be construed to be very
positive for the market,'' he said.

<HEAD>Latest 747 Wins FAA Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The advanced-technology Boeing 747-400, featuring
a two-person crew and distinctive winglets, has been certified for
use with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, Boeing Commercial Airplanes
announced Wednesday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued its approval Tuesday,
Boeing said in a statement, clearing the way for deliveries to
customer airlines.
   The aircraft, which in various configurations will seat
approximately 420 passengers, is due to be certified early this
spring for use with General Electric and Rolls-Royce engines.
   The flight test program for approval of the newest Boeing
jetliner has taken 8{ months and has focused on differences between
the 747-400 and earlier models of the jumbo jet, Boeing's Elizabeth
Reese said.
   Differences include a digital flight deck and avionic system plus
aerodynamic features such as increased wingspan and the winglets at
the wing tips.
   The flight deck is simplified and equipped for two crew members,
instead of the three-crew flight deck on other 747s.
   Boeing said the flight test program so far has required 2,600
hours of intensive testing, half of that in the air. Flight rates of
70 to 80 hours per month per airplane have been achieved, said the
company, one of the highest rates attained on such a program for
Boeing.
   Four planes have been used during the program, to certify the
three engines. Boeing said it is the first time it has attempted to
certify three different engine types in a single flight test program.
   Northwest Airlines selected P&amp;W4000 engines for its 747-400s when
it ordered 10 of the the aircraft on Oct. 22, 1985.
   Lufthansa ordered 12 747-400s delivered with GE CF6-80C2 engines
while Cathay Pacific has ordered two airplanes with Rolls-Royce
RB211-524G engines.
   So far, 21 customers worldwide have ordered 166 of the long-range
jetliners.

<HEAD>Illusions in The Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The free marketplace is a magnificent,
disciplined creation that distributes goods to where they should be
at the right _ or competitive _ price, the right time and generally
in the right amount.
   But it also is contrary. At the same time, it is forever filled
with idle dreams and grand illusions, some of which become so
all-enveloping that for a time they capture the minds of otherwise
sensible people.
   The eccentricity that leads to excess seems to occur with special
intensity in real estate and securities, but it can be found in
almost every area of the market, including automobiles, sports,
clothing, food, housing, electronics.
   The latest and biggest in the financial area, by far, is the
notion that junk bonds can be sold in enormous quantities at high
rates of interest and with little regard to a corporation's
financial structure _ without penalty.
   The penalty, of course, is merely delayed, since no corporation
can afford to pay rates greater than the market and greater than the
competition and still manage to operate as if it hadn't done so. The
penalty is delayed, not erased.
   Nobody can say when reality will appear, but economists who
examine the situation believe it might be in the midst of an
economic downturn and relatively high interest rates. That is,
business will be off and expenses up.
   It isn't the only major illusion at work today. One that is
growing popular in certain circles is that the economic cycle of ups
and downs has been broken, and that major booms and recessions are a
thing of the past.
   True, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests the cycle
has been muted, at least, and that instead of nationwide booms and
busts the economy now experiences what is sometimes termed ``rolling
readjustments.''
   Such economic events are limited rather than general, usually
involving one or a few geographical areas or industries at a time.
In mid-1986, for example, the nation's heartland was slumping while
the coastal economies were strong.
   The rolling adjustment thesis gains support from the current
six-year-long expansion, which generally is expected to last another
year or so. But to say the economic cycle has been broken is to take
a Grand Canyon-like leap.
   That is, while the immediate evidence might seem to substantiate
the belief, economic events are not nearly that forecastable. One
major event, such as a sudden rise in the price of oil, could
distill that notion to vapor.
   Do you recall when oil ``experts'' forecast $100 a barrel? When
the rage in the late 1960s was for growth stocks at price-earnings
ratios of 60? When in 1987 now-chagrined analysts foresaw 3500
points on the Dow Jones average?
   Can you forget the Texas-size optimism of savings and loans that
there were easy billions in real estate? That in the 1960s companies
risked their futures on bowling as the participant game of the
future?
   The no-check society? The home electronic center? Do you recall
how so many farmers lost their land by acquiring too much land,
believing that the price per acre would continue to rise like a line
to the horizon?
   Never underestimate the ability of the marketplace, a relatively
sane place when you analyze it, to produce aberrations that
continually find a stable of naive believers who, strangely, had
managed to succeed by using their heads.

   The stock market levelled off in quiet trading
today, steadying after Tuesday's modest pullback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.25 points on
Tuesday, rose 1.25 to 2,194.46 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   But losers held a slight edge on gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 649 up, 679 down and 548
unchanged.
   In each of the past four sessions the Dow Jones industrial
average has crossed 2,200 and then retreated again.
   Analysts said that repeated pattern had disappointed some traders
hoping to see the average climb to fresh new highs since the October
1987 crash.
   Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said technical
analysis did not show any particular significance to the 2,200
level, which the market passed easily in early 1987 and which showed
no sign of support in the collapse later that year.
   ``But in a struggling advance, a round number often represents a
psychological barrier,'' Zinder observed.
   Raychem led the active list and tumbled 4[ to 30|. The company
said it expects to post a significant earnings decline for its
fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31.
   Millipore, which estimated a smaller-than-expected sales increase
for the fourth quarter, slumped 2} to 31{.
   Polaroid rose ~ to 37]. Shamrock Holdings, which is making a
hostile $42-a-share bid for the company, said the Delaware Supreme
Court granted it an expedited appeal on a court decision relating to
the bid.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.06 to 157.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .26 at 312.69.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 98.17 million shares with two

   Share prices closed slightly lower Wednesday on the
London Stock Exchange, hit by a bout of profit-taking following
strong gains made in the last five trading sessions.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 1.9 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,834.1. The index fell as
much as 5.6 points in the afternoon, following concerted
intervention by major central banks to knock the dollar lower on
foreign-exchange markets, dealers said.
   But a strong opening on Wall Street helped London shares recover
from their worst levels. At its best, the 100-share index was down
just 0.8 point at midafternoon.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended with a loss of 4.7
points at 1,498.8.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 0.66 point to close at
1,032.87.
   Volume was moderate, edging up to 581.3 million shares from 563.5
million traded on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Concerted intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve
and several European central banks succeeded in knocking down the
dollar in active trading Wednesday.
   But the market's short-term bullish sentiment still helped the
currency bounce up from its session lows.
   Gold prices were down.
   Currency dealers said the first orchestrated intervention of the
year, with moderate participation by the Fed, the West German
Bundesbank, and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland, Italy,
Belgium, and the Netherlands, added a note of caution to trading.
   But they said it didn't stop the market from testing higher
levels again.
   ``The intervention wasn't enough to completely dent the dollar's
ambitions,'' said Nigel Green, assistant foreign exchange director
at EBC Amro Bank. ``The market is likely to play a cat and mouse
game with the central banks for the next few days.''
   Strong U.S. interest rates and technical factors have been
helping the dollar in recent weeks, although one trader said the
overall long-term outlook was somewhat bearish.
   ``The outlook will be bearish until we see or hear some very
positive news on the U.S. trade and budget front,'' he said,
referring to the twin deficits.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.25 yen to a closing 126.95 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 126.15 yen.
   The dollar fell against the British pound in London. Sterling
fethched $1.7815, vs. $1.7643 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8280 West German marks, down from 1.8355; 1.5550 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5645; 6.2270 French francs, down from 6.2555; 2.0595
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0589; 1,337.50 Italian lire, down from
1,338.50; and 1.2003 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2012.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $403.50 a troy ounce,
compared with $404.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at
$403.30 an ounce, up from $405.10.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.70 to close at a bid $404.48.
   Silver bullion prices in London to a late bid price of $5.94 a
troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $5.98.

<TEXT>
   Only one American worker in 100 was tested for
drug use last year, the government said Wednesday in announcing a
study that sharply reduced previous estimates of how many employers
conduct such tests.
   For job applicants, the chance of being tested was four times
higher than for workers already on the job, the Labor Department
survey of 7,500 employers showed.
   The survey, conducted last summer, found that only 3 percent of
all employers had drug-testing programs. Together, those companies
employed 20 percent of American workers.
   Just 7 percent of employers offered some type of drug counseling
or other employee-assistance program. In all, 31 percent of workers
were covered by these efforts.
   The survey found no rush to begin testing programs at
establishments that don't have them now. Only 4 percent of employers
said they were considering launching a testing program in the next
year; just 3 percent said they might create employee-assistance
programs.
   Those numbers were sharply lower than past estimates of the
prevalence of drug-testing programs.
   A 1986 survey of 492 organizations by the Employment Management
Association said 20.9 percent reported having testing programs. A
Michigan State University study that year said 43 percent of
employers who were not testing for drugs were considering doing so.
   Labor Department researchers, asked about the sharply lower
numbers in the their study, said the government's larger sample size
should make the new estimates the most accurate yet.
   The study did not include government workers, many of whom are
subject to drug testing under state and federal policies that are
the focus of dozens of legal challenges nationwide. The Labor
Department said no figures were available on the number of public
workers subject to drug testing.
   As to who is tested in the private sector, the 7,500 employers
told the Labor Department researchers that 953,000 workers had been
tested in the previous 12 months, compared to 3.9 million job
applicants.
   In all, the report said that ``about 85 percent of establishments
with testing programs targeted job applicants while 64 percent
focused on current employees. ... Employers with testing programs
appear to place a high priority on keeping potential drug problems
out of the workplace.''
   Studies have estimated that employers lose more than $8 billion a
year in wasted productivity because of drug use.
   Of the estimated 953,000 workers tested for drug use, the survey
said that 9 percent had tested positive. Of the applicants tested,
12 percent were positive.
   Researchers cautioned against taking those figures as
representative of the rate of drug use, because such a small
proportion of employees test for drugs and because so much testing
is performed on suspected drug users.
   Indeed, about two-thirds of employers conducting tests did them
only on workers suspected of drug use, while one-fourth had programs
that subjected all employees to possible testing.
   Workforce size was by far the biggest factor in determining
whether an employer had a drug-testing program.
   Of the nation's largest establishments, those with 1,000
employees or more, 43 percent tested for drugs while 76 percent
offered counseling or some other form of assistance. But only about
2 percent of the smallest establishments, those with fewer than 50
workers, had testing programs; 9 percent had employee-assistance
programs.
   A breakdown by industry found the highest rate of positive test
results, about 20 percent, among employees in wholesale and retail
trade.
   That industry also had the highest rate of positive test results
among applicants, 17 percent for wholesale trade and 24 percent for
the retail sector.
   The lowest rate of positive test results among employees was in
transportation, 5.6 percent, a statistic influenced by mandatory
testing in many sectors of the industry. Nearly 10 percent of
applicants for transportation jobs tested positive for drugs, the
study found.
   The rate of positive test results among applicants was lowest, at
5.5 percent, in communications and public utilities. Nearly 8
percent of workers in those industries who were checked tested
positive for drugs.
   Mining, communications and public utilities, and transportation
employers were most likely to have drug-testing programs, partly
because of regulatory requirements, the study said. Least likely to
have testing programs were retail trade, service and construction
establishments.

   Philip Morris Cos.' $12.9 billion acquisition of
Kraft Inc. leads a list of the largest corporate takeovers, buyouts
and other restructurings completed in 1988, according to a Fortune
magazine report.
   The biggest deal in history _ the $25 billion leveraged buyout of
RJR Nabisco Inc. by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co. _ was not included in the annual list because the buyout won't
be completed until 1989.
   Also pending at year's end was Grand Metropolitan PLC's $5.7
billion takeover of Pillsbury Co., the magazine said in its report
to be published in the Jan. 30 issue.
   Fortune said the total value of the 50 largest business deals
last year was $111.8 billion, easily surpassing the $94.6 billion
value of the 50 biggest deals in 1985, the previous record for the
magazine's list.
   Last year's transactions provided at least $687 million in
advisory fees to those overseeing the deals _ also a record for the
list _ not counting commissions on related financing, Fortune said,
citing public documents and other sources.
   Despite the publicity over the RJR Nabisco deal, Fortune said
most of last year's takeovers and restructurings were done the
old-fashioned way: not by corporate raiders wielding borrowed money,
but by corporate managers eyeing expansion.
   The No. 2 deal last year was Canadian developer Robert Campeau's
$6.5 billion acquisition of Federated Department Stores Inc., the
year's biggest deal involving a foreign company, Fortune said.
   In third place was the $5.15 billion buyout of Farmers Group
Inc., the California insurance company, by British tobacco-retailing
conglomerate BAT Industries PLC.
   The No. 4 deal was the $5.09 billion acquisition of Sterling Drug
Inc. by Eastman Kodak Co.
   In fifth place was Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s $4.7 billion
deal to pay a special dividend to stockholders of the railroad and
natural resources company to fend off a takeover bid by the Henley
Group.
   In sixth place was the Kroger Co.'s $3.9 billion deal to pay a
special dividend to fight takeover bids for the supermarket chain
from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Haft family.
   The No. 7 deal, the $3.6 billion buyout of papermaker Fort Howard
Corp., was the only leveraged buyout in the top 10.
   In eighth place was the $3 billion acquisition of Triangle
Publications Inc., which publishes TV Guide, by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp.
   The No. 9 deal was the $2.8 billion stock buyback by UAL Inc.,
the parent company of United Airlines.
   In 10th place was the largest-ever U.S. acquisition by a Japanese
company, Bridgestone Corp.'s $2.6 billion takeover of Firestone Tire
&amp; Rubber Co.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close Lower On Position-Evening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed moderately lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late selloff linked to
increasingly bearish expectations for an Agriculture Department crop
report.
   The report, scheduled for release after Friday's close, will
contain the government's final 1988 crop production totals, new
estimates of the nation's grain and soybean stockpiles, projections
for 1989 corn and soybean plantings and an actual tally of the
1988-89 winter wheat acreage.
   Analysts said they expected the report to show winter wheat
seedings to be more than 15 percent above the previous year. The
1988 corn and soybean production totals are expected to be higher
than the last USDA estimate.
   ``Ideas are beginning to develop that we'll have a slightly
bearish report, especially in the beans, which would carry
everything,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain market analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   The USDA last estimated 1988 crop production in November, when it
put the drought-shriveled soybean crop at 1.51 billion bushels, 21
percent below the 1987 harvest.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.45 a bushel; corn was \ cent to
2} cents lower with March at $2.86} a bushel; oats were } cent to 2}
cents lower with March at $2.36\ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to
7 cents lower with January at $7.98 a bushel.

<HEAD>Women Hail Discrimination Settlement As ``Moral Victory''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women praised the largest sex discrimination
settlement ever reached by the U.S. Labor Department as a ``moral
victory'' Wednesday, but the bank involved claimed no defeat, and
industry analysts questioned whether the case would have any
far-reaching effects.
   The $14 million settlement, to be shared by an estimated 5,000
women and minorities, arose out of a 1977 case in which the Labor
Department accused Chicago's Harris Trust and Savings Bank of
promoting white men at a higher rate and paying them more than women
and minority workers with comparable skills.
   Under terms of the agreement announced Tuesday, women and
minority workers employed by Harris from 1973 to 1988 will share $14
million in back pay.
   In addition, the bank must revise its affirmative action policies
and set up training programs for women and minorities seeking
promotions.
   ``This was for myself and many others a moral victory, a victory
of principle,'' said Marti Page, a former Harris employee. She said
six years of hard work left her doing little more clerical tasks
while earning 25 percent less than newly-hired male colleagues with
similar qualifications.
   Harris officials called the settlement ``a window out'' of a
sticky legal situation that cost 11 years' worth of legal fees and
bad publicity.
   ``We do not acknowledge any wrongdoing,'' company spokeswoman
Mary Ullrich said.
   In pursuing the case before an administrative law judge, the
federal government charged systemic discrimination throughout the
company. The Labor Department's solicitor, George R. Salem, said the
settlement would benefit not only Harris workers, but ``all women
and minority group workers in the American labor force.''
   Emily Richards, president of the National Association of Bank
Women, representing 27,000 women in financial services, said women
now make up 70 percent of the work force in banks and savings and
loans. By the year 2000, 66 percent of new entrants will be women.
   ``I hope the Harris settlement will help other companies realize
that women's needs must be met,'' she said.
   But industry analysts said Wednesday that affirmative action and
sensitivity to women's issues are now common in most companies, and
the settlement may have little impact outside Harris.
   ``Financial institutions are a lot more sensitive to this issue
and take more precautions. Most companies have already addressed the
issue,'' a New York analyst told The Associated Press, speaking on
condition he not be named.
   ``The board rooms are still dominated by men, but women are
finding themselves moving further along,'' he said.
   That wasn't the case at Harris in the 1970s, contended Women
Employed, a Chicago-based group that sued Harris on behalf of women
and minorities who found themselves trapped in dead-end jobs.
   ``You show me one male college graduate hired in 1970 who was
given a job with a typewriter,'' said Ms. Page. After completing a
college graduate management training program with ``excellent''
reviews, she said, she was assigned to type insurance forms.
   Harris denied any system-wide policy of discrimination.
   ``Show us the individuals ... and we will make this wrong
right,'' said Ms. Ullrich. ``We would have said `fine,' no questions
asked. But to say every woman, every minority _ no, no.''
   Not every employee of the bank who is entitled to the settlement
will collect. Some women don't feel they were discriminated against,
and are refusing their share.
   ``I won't accept an award,'' said one female Harris executive who
asked not to be named.
   But others are more than happy about it.
   Janet Schumacher said she waited 12 years to be promoted to a job
her male colleagues got in an average of three years.
   Ms. Schumacher, now an investment banker at First National Bank
of Chicago, said she stayed at Harris until 1987, despite her lack
of advancement, because she liked the job.
   When she tried to approach management and personnel officials to
request promotions and transfers, she said, ``they gave me such a
run-around.''
   Harris, which has assets of $11.7 billion, reported employing
3,967 workers as of Dec. 28, 1988. Of them, the company said 59.8
percent were women and 33.7 were minorities.
   Harris said it would put the settlement money in an escrow
account in another bank. The government is responsible for finding
the workers and determining how much back pay to award them.

<HEAD>Americans Not So Worried About Japanese Investment, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are not as worried about Japanese
investment in the United States as is commonly supposed, a
U.S.-Japan friendship organization said Wednesday in releasing a
poll.
   About 44 percent of Americans in three states where Japanese
direct investment is most heavily concentrated _ California,
Michigan and Tennessee _ agreed with the proposition that Japanese
direct investment is good for the U.S. economy.
   Seventeen percent disagreed, while 39 percent said they were
neutral.
   The poll was commissioned by the New York-based Japan Society
with funding from Japan's National Institute for Research
Advancement. In an attempt to ensure impartiality, it was conducted
by an outside organization, the University of Miami.
   ``I found it somewhat surprising'' that Americans' attitudes were
relatively favorable, David MacEachron, the Japan Society's
president, said at a news conference announcing the results.
   In addition to 1,200 members of the public, pollsters separately
interviewed 416 opinion leaders such as business leaders and
government officials, and 158 blue- and white-collar employees of
Japanese companies in the three states.
   Among the other findings:
   _In a negative finding, 45 percent of the public felt Japanese
direct investment causes the United States to lose its economic
i32 percent said no.
   _Fourteen percent of the public in the three states agreed _ but
36 percent disagreed _ that Japanese-affiliated companies had too
much political and economic influence in their states.
   _Seventy percent felt foreign direct investors, including the
Japanese, should be required to make public the nature and extent of
their U.S. investments. Eight percent disagreed.
   _While states have competed to attract Japanese companies with
special incentives, 56 percent disagreed with the idea that states
should offer more such incentives. Ten percent thought they should.
   _Opinion leaders were more likely to have a favorable opinion of
direct Japanese investment than the general public, and employees of
Japanese companies had the most favorable opinion of all.
   The poll was based on information gathered in late 1987 and early
1988. It was published last month, but not publicized until
Wednesday.
   Japan accounted for about $200 million of the $1.5 billion in
total foreign investment in the United States as of the end of 1987,
according to government figures. About a sixth of Japan's investment
is ``direct'' investment in factories, office buildings, real estate
and the like.

2,206.43, its highest close since it stood at 2,246.74 on Oct. 16,

   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in

<HEAD>New England Ski Resorts Suffer Slightly From Lack of Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is the winter of the New England ski
industry's discontent: Snowfall is below average and business is off
despite efforts to blanket the slopes with man-made white stuff.
   Packed natural powder provides the best skiing conditions and
most skiers tend to turn up their noses at the loose or frozen
granular cover provided by snow guns, if only for aesthetic reasons.
   ``It's a strange feeling to stand on a ski slope that's covered
in white and look out around at the houses down below and it's all
covered in brown,'' said Phil Camp, director of the New England Ski
Areas Council. ``The romance, the ambiance just isn't there.''
   Christopher H. Gill, manager of Great American Ski Renting Co.'s
store in North Conway, N.H., said ``the skiing is really good,''
thanks to artificial snow making in his area. But, he said, business
is down about 25 percent from last year.
   ``It really affects us when there's no snow down in Boston,''
Gill said. ``It's funny, if we get 3 inches of snow up here but
there's a foot in Boston, it does us more good than the other way
around.''
   Camp, who was hosting the council's annual convention for about
500 ski resort operators at Vermont's Stratton Mountain, said
man-made snow has received a bad reputation.
   ``A short period of time ago it was called `artificial snow,'
what a mistake that was,'' he said.
   Leslie B. Otten, director of Maine's Sunday River ski resort,
agreed: ``The first misnomer is that there's any difference in
quality between a man-made surface and a natuarl surface. What
generally changes skiing surface conditions is weather changes.''
   Those surfaces can be improved by grooming, and most slopes can
be almost completely groomed in two days of cold weather, Camp said.
   Operators have not seen a ``mass exodus from the slopes'' this
season, but Camp said that while the man-made snow is easier to
groom and moves better because it has less air, many still find it
too slick and don't like to ski on it.
   ``I'm here at Stratton Mountain and the average skier sure can't
complain,'' he said. ``There's a lot of skiing out here for people
who want it.''
   Only 4.1 inches of snow fell in the Boston area during the first
half of this season, compared to the average over the last 30 years
of about 9 inches. Up in ski country, the snowfall has been even
more disappointing for skiers.
   ``We're well below (average). We've had a big 3.8 inches this
season and that's almost 2 feet below normal,'' said John Cannon of
the National Weather Service in Portland, Maine.
   And in the last 108 years, this is the 100th driest snow season
in Maine, he said.
   Better snowmaking technology and high attendance last year
inspired resort operators to invest millions in upgrading their
snowmaking equipment, Camp said.
   ``If ever snowmaking is going to earn its keep it's this
season,'' he said.
   Okemo and Killington ski areas in Vermont have invested heavily
in snowmaking facilities and are operating at nearly full capacity,
Camp said.
   But small ski areas without adequate snowmaking facilities are
hurting. Sonnenberg in Barnard, Vt., hasn't even opened yet for the
season.
   ``I wish we had the equipment for the people, but sadly we
don't,'' said John Lancaster, whose wife, Virginia, operates the
hill.

<HEAD>Distributor Ends Up With Millions Of Unsold Rubber Gloves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical supplier that profited from
an AIDS-induced shortage of latex rubber gloves says it expects to
report a big loss because a glove glut has emerged, leaving it with
mountains of unsold merchandise.
   ``We have millions of gloves _ and more arriving,'' said John
Murray, vice president for finance at Moore Medical Corp.
   Moore Medical Corp., had profits of more than $4 million a year
in 1986 and 1987 and pre-tax earnings of $3.1 million in the first
three quarters of 1988, but it has alerted stockholders to brace for
a loss in the final quarter and for the year.
   The company said a one-time charge in the fourth quarter would be
in in the range of $7 million to $11 million, or $4.3 million to
$6.8 million on an after-tax basis.
   Moore's situation is typical of that of many medical supply
companies.
   Publicity about AIDS created an unprecedented demand for the
gloves last year. By spring, Moore Medical and other distributors
were rationing gloves to customers at a few boxes per order.
   ``We doubled and tripled up on orders to suppliers,'' Murray
said. But then supplies from new factories in Asia began arriving.
By late fall, he said, ``All of a sudden a lot of our orders were
coming in (and) what had been close to zero supply became a glut.''

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Collapse As Speculator Flight Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices collapsed Wednesday on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as speculators, spooked by weakening
technical signals, resumed their flight from the market.
   On other markets, energy futures scored sharp gains; grains and
soybeans declined; livestock and meat were mostly lower; precious
metal futures were down slightly; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Most coffee futures declined 6 cents a pound, the permitted limit
for daily trading. The limitless contract for delivery in March
settled 11.67 cents lower amid heavy volume at $1.3881 a pound, a
four-week low.
   ``The coffee market obviously crashed,'' said Arthur Stevenson,
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``We
had a literal avalanche.''
   But analysts could point to no new supply-and-demand developments
that might have precipitated the collapse. Instead, they said, the
barrage of sell orders was triggered by the market's decline through
successive ``sell stops,'' which are price levels at which
speculators had previously decided they would sell.
   Selling rapidly accelerated as the March contract's price
approached $1.43 a pound, Stevenson said.
   ``Once we fell through there, it attracted a great deal of
additional selling,'' he said.
   Coffee futures have been in a downward trend since Jan. 3, the
first trading session of the new year, when March coffee reached a
27-month high of $1.669 a pound on bullish supply and demand factors.
   Analysts said those factors, which include drought damage to the
Brazilian coffee crop and strong seasonal demand, have not changed,
although recent rains in Brazil may have halted the damage there.
   ``The only thing you can say is that volatility in the coffee
market continues to be very high,'' said Sandra Kaul, an analyst in
New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The extent of the move
upward is making the market very vulnerable to a downside
correction.''
   Energy futures prices rose sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, mostly in reaction to a weekly American Petroleum
Institute report showing a 5.5 million barrel decline in U.S. crude
oil stocks.
   ``A lot of oil that should have hit the market has not,'' said
Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Other analysts said members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries apparently were adhering to OPEC's new
production curbs, which became effective Jan. 1.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 9 cents to 48 cents higher
with February at $18.17 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent lower to
.33 cent higher with February at 53.75 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent lower to .89 cent higher with February at
48.80 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished moderately lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a late sell-off linked to increasingly
bearish expectations for Friday's Agriculture Department crop report.
   The report, scheduled for release after Friday's close of
trading, will contain the government's final 1988 crop production
totals, new estimates of the nation's grain and soybean stockpiles,
projections for 1989 corn and soybean plantings and an actual tally
of the 1988-89 winter wheat acreage.
   Analysts said they expected the report to show winter wheat
seedings to be more than 15 percent above the previous year. The
1988 corn and soybean production totals are expected to be higher
than the last USDA estimate.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with March at $4.44{ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 2} cents lower with March at $2.86} a
bushel; oats were } cent to 3 cents lower with March at $2.36 a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 7 cents lower with January at
$7.97{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures finished mixed
in technically inspired trading while pork futures fell amid bearish
fundamental factors.
   Live cattle settled .22 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
February at 73.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with January at 84.92 cents a pound; live hogs
were .05 cent to .75 cent lower with February at 45.42 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .75 cent lower with
February at 41.95 cents a pound.
   Most gold and silver futures drifted lower in lackluster trading
on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 30 cents to 40 cents lower with February at $405.20
a troy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent lower to 0.5 cent higher with
March at $5.995 a troy ounce.

   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani's resignation
comes at a sensitive time in the Wall Street crime crackdown he has
orchestrated, with at least a half-dozen major cases unresolved and
growing criticism of his strong-arm tactics by defense lawyers.
   Giuliani's temporary successor Benito Romano sought to minimize
the impact of his departure, particularly on the outstanding fraud
prosecutions. ``I think we're just beginning to see ... the
substantial insider trading and other securities cases,'' Romano
said Wednesday.
   Nonetheless, Giuliani's resignation announcement a day earlier
coincided with an embarrasing goof by subordinates that triggered a
mistrial in the first case to reach a jury, the stock manipulation
indictment of chemical company GAF Corp. and one of its top
officials.
   Moreover, the case against junk-bond giant Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., though ostensibly settled, still hasn't been finalized, and
the other shoe has yet to drop for Drexel's top financier Michael
Milken, who is expected to be indicted.
   The prosecutors have pushed back an indictment deadline several
times for John Mulheren, a securities executive accused of plotting
to assassinate convicted speculator Ivan Boesky with a loaded
assault rifle. The latest deadline is Feb. 12, nearly a year after
police arrested Mulheren outside his home.
   Although Giuliani's record is impressive _ including Boesky's
conviction and cooperation _ critics contend his love affair with
television cameras, political ambitions and a penchant for
inflexibility have led his office to prosecute some fraud cases
without enough evidence.
   The most remarkable and embarassing example thus far was the
headline-grabbing handcuff arrests and indictment of three prominent
brokers in February 1987 for securities fraud. A few months later
Giuliani had to drop the indictment and promised another. His office
still hasn't brought it.
   To be sure, Giuliani will be widely remembered as one of the most
vigorous prosecutors on Wall Street. During his tenure, he brought
several important white-collar felons to justice, particularly
Boesky and former investment banker Dennis B. Levine.
   He extracted cooperation from other implicated brokers, won a
$25.3 million settlement from Kidder Peabody Group Inc. and more
recently negotiated a record $650 million criminal plea-bargain
agreement with Drexel, though final details are still under
negotiation.
   ``Anybody would have to say his performance as a prosecutor was
effective,'' said Arthur Liman, a leading attorney who represents
Milken and GAF in the securities fraud prosecutions.
   But a key part of the Giuliani strategy has been his increasingly
criticized use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
law as a pressure tactic against Drexel and others who have resisted
him.
   The racketeering law, known as the RICO act, originally was meant
to fight violent gangsters, pushers and pimps. It allows the
government to seize a suspect's assets before trial and provides for
crippling penalties upon conviction.
   Many lawyers say privately that Drexel's fear of the racketeering
act led it to settle charges Dec. 21 that hadn't even been formally
filed. The prospect that the government could seize hundreds of
millions of dollars in assets and taint Drexel as a racketeer was
evidently too much for the firm's top directors.
   The awesome power of the racketeering statute was demonstrated to
Drexel earlier in the month when a smaller securities firm was
forced into liquidation because its partners faced a racketeering
indictment brought by Giuliani's office.
   ``Nobody in the world dreamed this would be used against
securities firms,'' said John S. Stoppelman, a Washington attorney.
   ``When you put it in the hands of an aggresive prosecutor with
political ambitions, we're back in the Star Chamber,'' he said.
``We're back to the abuses we were trying to correct in the English
system.''
   In Giuliani's view, Stoppelman said, the approach toward
securities fraud suspects smacks of presumed guilt, an easy
punishment if you cooperate and a devastating demise if you don't.
   ``They say, `We'll be nice to you. You play tennis in Lompoc
(minimum security prison) and you testify against this big
banana,''' he said.
   On the other hand, ``When they say, `We're gonna use RICO, we're
going to put the squeeze on you.' That's like saying, `We're going
to use the A-bomb.'''

<HEAD>Sells Six Planes To Continental</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, seeking to raise cash, has sold
six A-300 wide-body jet planes to sister carrier Continental
Airlines, the company announced Wednesday.
   Eastern will receive $103 million cash and a $67 million note at
17.5 percent interest for the sale, Eastern spokeswoman Karen
Ceremsak said.
   The planes had been leased earlier to Continental and therefore
will have no effect on the size of Eastern's fleet, she said.
   Ms. Ceremsak said the sale was unconnected to the breakdown of
federally-mediated talks between Eastern and its machinists' union.
   ``This is part of the continued efforts to raise cash,'' she said.
   When the talks collapsed on Monday, Joseph B. Leonard, an Eastern
senior vice president, said the company would have to move faster on
sales of its assets. The airline, which is seeking $150 million in
wage concessions from the 8,500-member International Association of
Machinists, estimates it is losing $1 million a day.
   Eastern is awaiting completion of a $365 million sale of its
Northeast shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump, and
reportedly is seeking buyers for such assets as Philadelphia gates
and some Canadian routes.
   Eastern insists that only a federal declaration of an impasse,
which would set a 30-day deadline, will get the 15-month-old
contract talks moving with the machinists, its largest union.
   Federal mediators have indicated they are not ready to take that
action, although there has been no word from the Washington-based
National Mediation Board about new talks.
   Under an impasse, if no settlement were reached in 30 days,
Eastern could impose its own work conditions and the union could
strike.
   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first three
quarters of 1988 and has lost more than $1 billion in the past
decade.

<TEXT>
   The European Monetary System has gone
for two years without a realignment in currency values, despite
sharp dollar movements, and analysts see no quick end to its
stability.
   The system that maintains stable exchange rates between European
currencies turns 10 years old in March. It has been realigned 11
times, but not once since Jan. 12, 1987, showing the system is
gaining stability against a volatile dollar.
   ``The EMS is moving into a new phase,'' said Steven Bell, chief
economist for Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co. Ltd. in London. ``The first few
years were fairly disruptive and chaotic, but the realignments have
been getting smaller.''
   Anne Vleminckx of Belgium's Generale de Banque SA, echoing the
views of other analysts, said a realignment may occur in the first
half of 1989 but that it would be easily digested by the markets. It
might be ``almost a non-event,'' she said.
   The European Monetary System groups eight European Economic
Community currencies: those of West Germany, the Netherlands,
France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Ireland. They range
against one another within bands that have fixed upper and lower
limits.
   If a currency exceeds its limits, central banks must intervene or
governments must take monetary action. If that has no effect, the
European Monetary System must be realigned.
   As a rule, the European Monetary System faces realignment when
either the dollar has fallen too sharply, or the West German mark
becomes too strong against the French franc. West Germany and France
account for nearly half of total EEC output.
   The dollar defies easy prediction, but the current bullish trend
on the eve of the Bush administration is reassuring European
Monetary System watchers.
   A fall in the dollar normally spurs investors to put more money
in West German marks, lifting them against other European Monetary
System currencies and pushing the monetary system to the breaking
point.
   The dollar's long slide from early 1985 was blamed for the 1987
realignment. But today, analysts feel, the threat is more likely to
come from internal difficulties.
   Recently, ``Tensions usually only start when the dollar is at
1.70 marks or below,'' said Reinhard Kudiss, an economist at the
West German Industry Federation in Cologne.
   At the start of 1988, the European Monetary System survived a
drop in the dollar to 1.58 marks. Lately, though, the dollar has
been if anything too strong, not too weak. On Wednesday, central
banks were aggressively selling dollars and buying marks to prop up
the West German currency.
   The more difficult problem is a growing Franco-German schism.
Although the mark's recent weakness has caused the issue to recede
in importance, economists say it could re-emerge if the mark begins
to strengthen again against the French currency.
   France's booming economy has been heavily importing West German
capital goods while Germany's trade surplus with other EEC countries
is ballooning.
   Also, West German inflation is around 1.5 percent, against
roughly double that for France. Higher inflation means French francs
are steadily losing their real value in terms of marks.
   West German officials, cautious not to upset their exporters with
a more costly mark, have rejected an European Monetary System
realignment.
   ``I think it's very doubtful a realignment will be an issue in
the foreseeable future,'' Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said
in late December.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has added to that, ``One
must take seriously that the two most important governments (within
the EMS) of France and West Germany do not want a realignment ....'
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said last week, ``I
flatly rule out a devaluation of the French franc.''
   For France a revalued mark means costlier imports and more
inflation. With local elections in March, Paris is unlikely to want
to give unions reason for discontent.
   Yet firm denials of a realignment are ritual exercises that may
ease but rarely kill market tension.
   ``The trade surpluses with the rest of the EEC are getting to be
an embarrassment to the German authorities and cannot go on
forever,'' according to Nigel Rendell, an economist with the London
brokerage James Capel Bankers Ltd.
   West Germany's trade surplus surged 25 percent in November to its
second-highest monthly surplus ever. The gain came from trade with
other EEC countries, while the surplus with the United States has
been shrinking.
   Analysts expect a 1989 realignment, if any, would upgrade the
value of the mark and the Dutch guilder, the other EMS stalwart, by
3 to 4 percent and devalue the lira by several percentage points.
Opinions varied on other currencies.
   France can normally live easier with its electorate after an
upward valuation of the mark and guilder than with a devaluation of
the franc.
   This happened in 1987 when the French and three other currencies
were left unchanged while the mark and guilder were valued upward by
3 percent and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs were valued upward
by 2 percent.
   Analysts see the Italian lira as a likely candidate for change in
any realignment even though it has been unusually stable.
   Within the European Monetary System, the lira can range within 6
percent above and below the system's parity rates. For the other
currencies, that divergence is 2.5 percent either way.
   Of late, the lira has traded near, and at times within, 2.25
percent of its parity rate against the mark.
   Analysts said a realignment of currencies this year, if any, is
not likely to occur anytime near September, when the composition of
the European Currency Unit is up for review. The unit is based on
the currencies of the eight European Monetary System currencies plus
the pound and the Greek drachma.

   The mastermind of a $2.4 million
self-chilling can fraud, who authorities said is cooperating in
probes of organized crime backing of penny stock frauds, was
sentenced to 12 years in prison Wednesday.
   Marshall Zolp pleaded guilty in April 1987 to racketeering for
the Lasar Arms case, in which he and 13 people were indicted for
bilking investors with plans to introduce a bogus self-chilling
beverage container.
   Three months later, five defendants who stood trial were
convicted. Zolp, the 13th defendant sentenced, did not testify.
   Zolp and his co-defendants promoted Laser Arms, incorporated in
March 1986, through fake news releases, ads, and shareholder reports
to inflate the price. They even staged a phony news conference in
New York City. Actors were photographed to portray fictitious
executives on company documents.
   His plea, part of an agreement to cooperate with the government,
was unsealed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Alfred Lechner Jr.
Zolp could have received 20 years in prison.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert P. Warren told Lechner of Zolp's
cooperation in a number of stock fraud investigations, some
involving organized crime members. Indictments are expected,
authorities said.
   He said Zolp was used as a ``vehicle'' by mobsters for committing
stock frauds, and was ``viewed by a number of people as a person
they could franchise to make money for them.''
   Zolp's defense attorney, Raymond Sussman of New York, went
farther. He said that mobsters beat Zolp and threatened him to
continue carrying out the Laser Arms fraud. Zolp, who was living in
the Los Angeles area, is in the witness protection program.
   Sussman said that despite a ``track record'' of securities
violations, Zolp never meant to perpetrate such an extended fraud as
Laser Arms.
   Commenting after the hearing, Sussman said mob members kidnapped
Zolp, drove him out to Long Island, N.Y., and held a gun to his
side, saying he was to be murdered. Instead, they beat him.
   ``They said, `This is just a warning. Go back to work,''' said
the attorney. Sussman said his client was manipulated by figures
associated with New York-area mob families.
   In court, Sussman also revealed that Zolp had provided
information to the FBI about members of a ``terrorist group'' jailed
with Zolp at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.
Prosecutors would not identify the group further, but Sussman said
they were two foreigners awaiting deportation who had legal
proceedings in federal court in Newark, and that the information was
about a possible escape attempt.
   Two Sikhs accused of terrorism in India were recently ordered
extraditable by a U.S. magistrate here. Zolp has spent the past two
years at MCC, where the Sikhs are being held.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has implicated Zolp in at
least seven security fraud cases nationwide since the early 1980s.
   According to an affidavit by an SEC attorney filed in federal
court here, Zolp raised millions of dollars in stock offerings,
using aliases, newspaper advertisements and misleading financial
statements _ living a high lifestyle off the proceeds.
   A federal prosecutor two years ago said in court that Zolp
``changes identities as easily as other people change their
clothes.'' The prosecutor, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Faith
Hochberg, said Zolp even once dashed across the tops of dinner
tables to escape the law.
   Zolp served two years in Vietnam, carrying out 60 combat missions
before deserting to Europe, where he lived for six years before
returning under an amnesty program and developing a drinking
problem, said Sussman.
   ``Jail has taught me fear, fear of ever having to return,'' Zolp
told Lechner. ``I stand here shamed today. I stand here disgraced. I
am financially insolvent, however I am rehabilitated,'' he said.
   But Lechner harshly rejected Zolp's claim of acting out of
character.
   ``Your conduct has been your character,'' the judge said. ``You
are a con man.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Grants Defense Motion Aimed At Halting New Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court granted a defense request
Wednesday for a hearing to determine whether it should at least
temporarily halt a new trial in the stock-manipulation case against
GAF Corp. and a top company aide.
   The appellate move came a day after a lower-court judge declared
a mistrial and dismissed the jurors because of prosecutorial
mishandling of a key piece of evidence in the GAF case, the first
major case arising from the Wall Street corruption scandal to reach
the trial phase.
   U.S. District Judge Mary J. Lowe wanted to start over and pick
new jurors, but the defense objected on grounds of double jeopardy,
the legal theory that a defendant can't be retried twice for the
same offense.
   Defense attorneys immediately appealed her intention to restart
the trial to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which said it would
hear arguments on the matter Thursday.
   GAF and Vice Chairman James Sherwin were indicted in July on
charges they attempted to manipulate upward the value of Union
Carbide Corp. stock in late 1986 after a failed takeover attempt of
the larger company. The alleged motive was to maximize the gain GAF
would realize from the sale of its stake in Carbide.
   Evidence for the indictment has been supplied largely by
securities trader Boyd L. Jefferies, who claimed his Los Angeles
brokerage was utilized by GAF to conduct manipulative trades in
Carbide stock to inflate the price.
   Jefferies is a leading government witness in at least three major
securities fraud prosecutions. He has been cooperating as a result
of his own plea bargain with federal prosecutors to settle
securities law violations.

   Merck &amp; Co., the pharmaceuticals giant, tops a
list of America's most admired companies for the third year in a
row, while Financial Corp. of America again was the least admired,
Fortune magazine said Wednesday.
   To compile the list of corporate reputations, contained in
Fortune's Jan. 30 issue, the magazine said it surveyed about 8,000
top executives, outside corporate directors and financial analysts

   Among the criteria the companies were rated on were
innovativeness, community responsibility, quality of products or
services, quality of management, value as a long-term investment,
abilty to keep talented people, financial soundness and use of
assets.
   Rubbermaid Inc. again came in No. 2 on the most admired list. No.
3 was Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., the adhesives maker
commonly called 3M, which moved up from 6th place in the magazine's
1987 survey.
   The other top 10 on the list, in descending order: Philip Morris
Cos., the tobacco and food giant; Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discount
retail chain; Exxon Corp.; Pepsico Inc.; Boeing Co., Herman Miller,
an office-furniture maker; and Shell Oil.
   On the least admired list, after Financial Corp. of America, a
California-based savings and loan holding company that has filed for
reorganization, came Gibralter Financial Corp., another
California-based thrift, and Texas Air Corp., the controversial
holding company for Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines.
   The other bottom 10, in descending order: Meritor Financial
Group, a Philadelphia savings institution holding company;
BankAmerica Corp., the San Francisco bank holding company; LTV
Corp., the steel company; Goldome Inc., a Buffalo, N.Y., financial
institution holding company; Control Data Corp., the computer

   Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday offered
low-interest financing and extended cash-back rebates on some of its
1988 and 1989 cars and trucks.
   The company also offered special deals for Mercury Tracer buyers
in California, where import competition is particularly stiff.
   Ford said in a news release that a nationwide financing plan with
interest as low as 4.9 percent, depending on the term of the loan,
will be offered through March 2 on some cars and trucks. Buyers have
an option on those vehicles of taking cash rebates ranging from $400
to $750.
   California residents who buy a Tracer, which competes with small
foreign cars, will have the chance through March 2 of taking a 3.9
percent financing deal.
   Also in California, the company began offering $300 in cash to
existing rebate programs for buyers of 1988 and 1989 Ford Taurus and
Mercury Sable cars with 3.8-liter, six-cylinder engines. That rebate
was created because of larger-than-anticipated supplies of those
cars, Ford spokesman Bill Carroll said.
   In addition, Ford said it was extending until March 2 rebate
offers scheduled to expire Thursday for a variety of cars and trucks
ranging from $400 to $3,000.

   Poultry processor Holly Farms Corp. has
put off until next week a decision on competing buyout offers from
Tyson Foods Inc. and ConAgra Inc., Tyson's chief executive said
Wednesday.
   Holly Farms had scheduled a meeting of its board for Wednesday to
consider the bids, but delayed the session until Tuesday to give
Tyson executives a chance to visit Holly Farms' plants and talk to
its employees, Don Tyson said.
   Holly Farms, based in Memphis, Tenn., refused to comment on its
plans.
   Tyson Foods has offered $1.06 billion, or $60 a share, for Holly
Farms, which has agreed to be acquired by ConAgra in a $1 billion
stock swap.
   Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry processor, has been
trying since the fall to buy Holly Farms, the nation's third-largest
poultry processor. ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb., is in second
place, and whichever company wins Holly Farms will rank as No. 1.
   Tyson is based in Springdale, Ark.
   ConAgra has refused to say if it will counter Tyson's bid.
