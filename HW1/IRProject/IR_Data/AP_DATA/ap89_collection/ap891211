   When she was born, Beth Cole's doctors said
she would never be able to walk, but the 14-year-old high school
freshman has overcome congenital bone defects and is now a
cheerleader.
   After enduring years of operations, including amputation of both
feet, she attends Wynford High School Royals basketball games,
wearing artificial limbs that fit over the calf up to the knee.
   ``My parents and God have helped me,'' she said before dashing
onto the court at a recent basketball game.
   ``She has the guts and potential that are God-given,'' said her
father, William. ``We take very little credit. She's done it on her
own.''
   At birth, Beth's hips were dislocated and the bones in her legs
weren't formed. Doctors said she would never walk.
   At three months, doctors wrapped her body in a full cast, hoping
to straighten her hips. She wore the cast until she was 11 months
old.
   After hundreds of treatments by specialists at Shriners Hospital
for Crippled Children in Chicago, she finally decided at age 10 to
undergo amputation instead of bone fusion.
   After the first amputation, she walked into her fourth-grade
classroom on the first day of school with a prosthesis on her right
leg and a pair of crutches.
   She underwent the second amputation in June 1988, but only after
playing for the seventh-grade girls volleyball team and trying out
for cheerleading.

   More than a half-century after
fleeing the Nazis, 81-year-old Nina Rubinstein on Monday received
her doctorate in sociology at Frankfurt university.
   ``It's the last thing I expected in my life,'' said Miss
Rubinstein, of New York. ``I'm elated, I'm proud, I'm surprised.''
   The dean of Frankfurt's Johann Wolfgang Goethe University's
sociology department, Lothar Brock, said Miss Rubinstein was
awarded the degree magna cum laude.
   It was a big surprise for the retired United Nations
interpreter, who was 25 when she fled the Nazis in 1933, leaving
behind her completed 247-page thesis for her doctorate.
   She first fled to France and then to the United States, when
Hitler's troops marched on France.
   ``I'm not particularly proud of myself in general, but I thought
the dissertation was rather good,'' Miss Rubinstein said. It was
delivered in German.
   ``But frankly I did not expect a magna cum laude. That was a
very enormous surprise,'' she said, chuckling.
   Miss Rubinstein arrived in West Germany last week to take part
in a colloquium Friday, part of 75th anniversary celebrations at
the universtiy's social sciences department.
   ``I'm absolutely shattered. I think I never have been so
exhausted, not only physically, but psychologically too, after that
day on Friday,'' the soft-spoken Miss Rubinstein said.
   As part of the colloquium, Miss Rubinstein read several poems,
taking an active part in the ceremonies, said Professor David
Kettler, who was instrumental in arranging for her to get the
degree.
   Kettler, of Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, said it
took him a year, along with Miss Rubinstein's half-sister, Hanna
Papanek, to make arrangements for awarding the doctorate.
   ``It was like one of those ideas you suddenly have in the
shower,'' Kettler said. ``This is the university facing up to its
responsibility to its students and faculty. She did the work and
deserves to be recognized for it.''
   Miss Rubinstein was born in Berlin in 1908 to parents of Jewish
descent, who fled their native Latvia as political exiles after the
failed Russian revolution of 1905.
   She lived in neutral Denmark from 1914 through 1917, where she
had fled with her mother to avoid World War I.
   Later she returned to Germany to study, and in 1928 began
working toward her degree under the noted sociology professor, Karl
Mannheim.
   Miss Rubinstein recalled how she enjoyed being in Mannheim's
presence, and how the students used to meet him at Cafe Laumer in
the university area of Frankfurt's Bockenheim district.
   ``We very often met there with Mannheim. Of course, all the
young ladies there adored him, he was extremely attractive, I've
never forgotten that,'' she said.
   Miss Rubinstein then pointed out photographs showing herself,
and other students reading and chatting at the cafe with Mannheim,
taken between 1930 and 1933.
   ``He went to England right away'' after the Nazis came, Miss
Rubinstein said. ``I never saw him again. I lost contact with him.''
   Mannheim, who last worked at the London School of Economics, had
published dozens of manuscripts on sociology, including ``Man and
Society in an Age of Reconstruction,'' in 1935. He died in England
in 1947.
   Miss Rubinstein said she was ready to defend her thesis, titled
``The French Emigration after 1789 _ A Contribution to the
Sociology of Political Emigration,'' when the Nazis took over
Frankfurt university in 1933.
   She said a Nazi student retrieved her thesis, which she left
behind on a desk in the university, before she fled to Paris.
   In Paris she worked as a translator and secretary for a literary
agency, but fled again in 1940 when the Nazis invaded France,
leaving everything behind, including her thesis.
   A French neighbor kept Miss Rubinstein's belongings, and after
the war traced her to New York and sent the thesis to her, she said.
   Miss Rubinstein, who worked as a simultaneous translator,
``mostly in Russian,'' for the United Nations, shelved the thesis
for years until her half-sister, Ms. Papanek, a research professor
of anthropology at Boston University, began trying to get it
published.
   Later, efforts by Ms. Papanek, Kettler, and Frankfurt
university's Brock and Professor Claudia Honegger, arranged for
Miss Rubinstein to finally receive her degree.
   Miss Rubinstein said she will return to New York Thursday.
   ``I'm incredibly tired and I have the feeling when I come back
to New York I'm going to go to bed and stay there for a couple of
days,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A mob informant and his Rhode Island
police guards developed such a loose relationship over 3{ years
that they frolicked in Florida together and sold vehicles to each
other, even though the protected witness was serving a prison term.
   And security was so lax that anybody looking for informant Peter
Gilbert _ a prized witness who traveled to court surrounded by
police sharpshooters _ had only to look in Rhode Island auto title
applications to find the address of his supposedly secret hideaway.
   His widow, Debra, and her lawyer also alleged in recent
interviews at her Florida home that police told Mrs. Gilbert to
turn in phony receipts for Gilbert's expenses.
   A Rhode Island attorney general's report also said Gilbert,
serving a 10-year prison term for murder at the time he was a
protected witness, illegally had guns and improperly collected
welfare and often was allowed to roam freely. He frequently was
ferried to Florida with his guards, some of whom allegedly brought
their girlfriends.
   ``It was just as if they were a bunch of fraternity guys,
skydiving, drinking, women,'' said Thomas Hogan Jr., Mrs. Gilbert's
attorney.
   Mrs. Gilbert's revelations are the latest about her husband's
custody that have surfaced since he died June 11, 1988. They
flabbergast the man who founded the federal witness protection
program.
   ``Our prime goal is to keep him alive, to keep him in the right
frame of mind to testify,'' said John Partington, a former U.S.
marshal recently named Providence, R.I., public safety commissioner.
   Gilbert, 43, died of a heart attack while on an unsupervised
skydiving trip to Connecticut. The attorney general's report later
acknowledged police knew he had a history of heart problems. Police
found cocaine in his car.
   Rhode Island state police are investigating, but previous
reports by the attorney general and The Providence Journal-Bulletin
showed the state spent as much as $169,000 on Gilbert and his wife
during his 3{ years in police custody _ purchases included bullets,
liquor, jewelry, concert tickets and 52 skydiving trips.
   Two of Gilbert's guards have committed suicide since his death
and two were reassigned from the police intelligence unit to the
uniform division. Former Providence Police Chief Anthony J.
Mancuso, who became the attorney general's chief drug enforcement
officer while continuing to be paid by Providence after stepping
down as chief, recently resigned from the attorney general's office
and the force, citing continued publicity about the Gilbert case.
   Gilbert was supposed to be a key witness against six reputed
mobsters but testified against only one before his death. Because
he died, charges against most of the others were dropped.
   Under an agreement with the attorney general's office, Gilbert
lived at the Providence police station from his arrest in February
1985 until his transfer to a Glocester, R.I., safe house in January
1988. Mrs. Gilbert alternated between living in Florida and with
her husband in Rhode Island.
   Police and the attorney general's office refused to release the
safe house address, but it was listed on a March 1988 title
application Gilbert filed at the Motor Vehicle Registry in
connection with a car loan.
   ``That is unbelievable,'' Partington said. ``You don't have to
be a police chief or security expert to say it's unthinkable'' for
Gilbert's address to be in public records.
   Gilbert paid Detective Jeffrey Ward $3,000 for a 13-year-old
Harley Davidson motorcycle in April 1988, according to sales tax
documents provided by a source close to the investigation who
demanded anonymity.
   ``I know about a motorcycle,'' said Ward, who declined to answer
other questions.
   Providence and state police and the attorney general's office
won't comment on the case. Mancuso, who stepped down in 1988,
denied knowledge of any transactions between Gilbert and his
guards, but would say no more.
   Mrs. Gilbert won`t talk about many things because of the pending
state police investigation. But Hogan said that among her other
allegations are that:
   _ Gilbert sold a Chrysler Cordoba to police matron Eva Diaz in
early 1986. No title could be found under either name and Diaz
referred questions to Mrs. Gilbert. Diaz said she took over loan
payments on Gilbert's 1984 Buick after his death.
   _ Gilbert told his wife her sixth-anniversary ring in 1987 was
bought from Ward, who denies it.
   _ Police officers told her to get phony receipts to include with
the ones submitted to the attorney general for Gilbert's expenses _
receipts the attorney general's report says often were not
reviewed. Mrs. Gilbert says she never heeded the officers' advice
and won't name them.
   Mrs. Gilbert said her husband made at least a dozen state-paid
trips to Florida for family visits and to clear up outstanding
charges, including a prison break. Hogan said the guards often
brought girlfriends.
   Hogan said the guards and women would stay in hotel rooms while
Gilbert would stay with his wife at her home, more than a mile
away. It could not be determined who paid for the rooms or if the
guards watched Mrs. Gilbert's house.
   WPRI televison in Providence recently broadcast home videos of
Gilbert and his guards frolicking in Florida and at a vacation home
in Narragansett, R.I.
   One tape showed an officer, with his arm around Gilbert, saying:
``The criminal justice system has been very, very good to us, huh
Peter?''

   Masked men set off explosives that
destroyed 80 apartments under construction in a tourist complex,
police said. The separatist Corsican National Liberation Front
claimed responsibility.
   Police said two men wearing hoods tied up 11 people living at
the site, mostly construction workers, and drove them to a village
15 miles away before detonating the blast early Monday in the
apartment complex in Calvi on the northwestern coast of this French
Mediterranean island.
   No injuries were reported.
   The Corsican National Liberation Front claimed responsibility in
a statement made public in the Bastia, the nearest major city,
saying it was fighting ``speculative enterprises which will lead
eventually to the marginalization of our people on their own land.''
   A similar attack last month destroyed 135 apartments under
construction at Santa Lucia di Porto Vecchio in southeastern
Corsica.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parallel to the revolution around
it, Prague's 700-year-old shrinking Jewish community has staged its
own tumultuous uprising and deposed old leaders who had
accommodated the Communists.
   Freedom might fire the dwindling band with fresh life, the new
leader said, but even that may not be enough.
   Furor erupted when the Council of Jewish Communities did not
protest the police beating of student demonstrators Nov. 17. It was
the only Czechoslovak religious group to remain silent.
   Rabbi Daniel Mayer sent his own letter, decrying ``brutality and
arrogance,'' then threatened to quit if Bohumil Heller and
Frantisek Kraus did not relinquish command of the council.
   Young Jews already had criticized the two, in another letter,
for what they described as sacrificing principles to appease
authorities.
   In a noisy open meeting Sunday, Prague Jews reinstated Desider
Galsky, a 68-year-old historian who was council president until
Czechoslovak authorities forced him out in 1985.
   ``Everyone is watching me now,'' Galsky said, ``but I cannot
create a heaven in 24 hours. These will be difficult times.''
   His main concern is that simple attrition will accomplish what
Adolf Hitler could not: turn Prague's 13th century Old-New
Synagogue into a museum.
   The Nazis found 47,000 Jews in Prague and killed most of them,
but spared the medieval Jewish Quarter, with its relics and
documents, as a museum of deviant culture.
   Jews returned after the war, but more than 1,000 are on
community rolls, fewer than 2,000 others live in the city and
three-quarters are over 65. About 10,000 Jews live elsewhere in
Czechoslovakia.
   ``For every 20 who die, two or three others join,'' said Mayer.
``We are very worried about the numbers.''
   Asked whether new freedoms in Czechoslovakia would help the
Jews, he replied without a pause: ``No.''
   Mayer said the government Council on Religious Affairs probably
would end its subsidies, and the community would find it hard to
survive. Jewish leaders accept the money on grounds the state
seized priceless objects in the 1950s and never paid compensation.
   Pressed on the subject, Mayer chuckled and added: ``On balance,
I suppose I'd rather have freedom.''
   Galsky said he was negotiating to keep the annual stipend,
equivalent to about $30,000, but only if other religious groups
retained theirs.
   ``We hope that Jews around the world will help us,'' he said.
   Money aside, many Prague Jews think a more open Czechoslovakia
will bring out Jews who once feared praying in public.
   ``I think things will be better,'' said Vida Neuwirthova, a
27-year-old puppeteer who runs a Jewish children's troupe and works
with the Jewish choir. ``We badly need young people.''
   Her choir has emerged from years in which authorities would not
let it perform in public because choir members refused to exclude
the wife of Ivan Klima, a dissident writer whose works were banned
until recently.
   Ms. Neuwirthova knows it will be an uphill fight. She has yet to
persuade her husband, who is not a Jew, to allow a bar mitzvah when
their 2-year-old is 13.
   ``He does not want his son to be different,'' she said.
   Bar mitzvahs average one every two years, but Galsky plans to
encourage foreign Jews to come to Prague for bar mitzvahs and
weddings in what he calls the oldest continuous Jewish congregation
in Europe.
   Saturday morning services are in a narrow, vaulted room off the
locked main temple. A dozen old men in shawls murmur Hebrew,
sitting at a kitchen table whose plastic cover is patterned with
gaily colored animals.
   Much livelier is the community's kosher restaurant in the
building next door, not to be confused with the nearby Old
Synagogue Restaurant, which serves roast pork and dumplings.
   Tourists normally outnumber Jews in the cobbled streets that
wind among houses built centuries ago by merchants and
intellectuals. Two old synagogues are museums, containing 300,000
of the silver ornaments, prayer shawls and documents Hitler planned
to display.
   At the old Jewish cemetery, visitors thread their way among
broken stone tombs where people were buried up to nine deep to save
precious space.
   Only for holidays, and in times of crisis, do Prague Jews come
out in force, and the question is how long there will be enough.
   ``Who knows?'' reflected Galsky. ``In 10 years, we might still
be all right. But in 20?''
   At the open meeting, Jiri Radvansky, a 33-year-old pediatrician
who reads no Hebrew and wears no yarmulke, drew loud applause for a
tongue-lashing.
   He said he joined the community as a child to be among other
Jews and was distressed to see people leave it over the years
because of internal squabbles. Clearly, he was unhappy about
compromises made with communism.
   Radvansky excoriated Jews who fight among themselves as their
numbers dwindle, and proposed a group for people interested in
Jewish culture, whatever their own religion.
   ``We must stop this stupid bickering and protect our heritage,''
he said. ``Otherwise, we will disappear.''

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artists and intellectuals in Taiwan are
excavating the dark past of the Nationalist government, sparking a
cultural boom in this economic powerhouse.
   Movies, court cases, a radio drama and the recent election
campaign have created a flood of pressure on this island of 20
million to confront its past.
   The boom has also given voice to native Taiwanese, who make up
85 percent of the population but have had scant political influence
since 1949 when the Nationalist Party seized power after losing a
civil war to the Communists on mainland China.
   ``We are awakening after a long sleep,'' says Antonio Chiang,
editor of the prestigious Journalist magazine. ``We are finally
learning who we are, where we came from.''
   Taiwanese have always regarded their rocky island as ``the
orphan of Asia,'' as a popular song goes. Since the 17th century,
they have been ruled by Spaniards, Dutch, Japanese and Chinese from
the mainland.
   When the Nationalists took power, they imposed the culture of
the mainland on the little island. Mandarin Chinese replaced
Taiwanese dialect in the classroom and students were fined if they
spoke the local patois. Taiwanese history was dominated by Chinese
history.
   Only fools or gangsters spoke Taiwanese on TV.
   ``I don't know how many times my teacher made me stand with a
board around my neck, saying `I`ll never speak Taiwanese again,'''
said Chen Shui-pien, a leading opposition politician. ``The
mainlanders made us feel like Taiwanese natives were second-class
citizens.''
   A change came in 1987 when then-President Chiang Ching-kuo ended
38 years of martial law. Taiwan's astounding economic growth had
created an increasingly sophisticated population which no longer
tolerated harsh political repression.
   The government relaxed its tight controls on the press,
legalized opposition political parties and began tolerating some
dissent.
   A further boon to the cultural boom came in June, when Communist
Chinese troops in Beijing crushed a pro-democracy movement. The
tragedy in Tiananmen Square sparked Taiwanese to probe Nationalist
abuses.
   In October, ``City of Sorrow,'' an award-winning film, opened in
Taiwan to packed houses. The movie was the first to explore the
Feb. 28, 1947 massacre, when Nationalist troops slaughtered tens of
thousands of Taiwanese after clashes between island natives and
mainland immigrants.
   A deaf-mute plays the central role and witnesses the horrors _ a
powerful metaphor for Taiwan's silenced intellectuals.
   In its portrayal of a gangster clan, the movie probes the
politically sensitive question of organized crime's influence over
politics. Ironically, the film is reported to be backed by gangland
money.
   A wildy-popular radio drama also has its roots in Taiwan's past
_ the Japanese occupation from 1895-1945. Liao Tien-ting is
Taiwan's Robin Hood, who robs Japanese imperialists and gives to
the poor.
   The show draws thinly veiled parallels between Japan's
occupation and Nationalist government domination in Taiwan. Its
announcer has entered politics and is a strong supporter of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
   Taiwan's recent election campaign, the first multiparty race in
its history, also made use of the past and Taiwanese culture.
   One successful candidate for the Legislature, Yeh Chu-lan,
advocated independence from China, a seditious act under the
Constitution. Her victory gave voice to an undercurrent of support,
especially among native Taiwanese, for cutting all ties with
Beijing.
   Taiwanese folk songs filled the air at her rallies. A guerrilla
theater troupe acted out scenes of alleged Nationalist brutality _
the 1947 killings and the death of Yeh's husband, a dissident who
immolated himself in April to escape police interrogation.
   The troupe also portrayed scenes from a 1979 riot in the
southern city of Kaohsiung.
   On Dec. 10, 1979, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in
Kaohsiung for human rights and hundreds were injured in a brawl.
The government rounded up more than 150 dissidents and dozens were
sentenced to long jail terms.
   A celebrated court case has also returned attention to the
bloody clash. In September, fugitive dissident Hsu Hsin-liang,
wanted for allegedly fomenting the riot, was arrested as he tried
to slip into Taiwan on a fishing boat.
   Hsu's case sparked exposes in the increasingly free press.
   In October, the Journalist claimed police used torture and
intimidation to extract confessions of participants in the riot.
Other reports have called for an investigation of the killings of
the wife and daughter of one of the Kaohsiung dissidents, Lin
Yi-hsiung, jailed after the clash.
   ``The government should have forgetten the case and welcomed Hsu
back,'' said opposition figure Chen, also Hsu's attorney.
``Instead, they were too worried about losing face, so they're
prosecuting him. That has opened up this old wound and the
opposition is profiting from the controversy.''
   Some intellectuals oppose this use of Taiwan's history and
culture as a political weapon.
   Hou Hsiao-hsien, who directed ``City of Sorrow,'' says he made
the movie to return history to the people.
   ``The Nationalists and the opposition are using the February 28
incident like a trump card,'' he said in a recent interview. ``The
movie was my way of butting into their card game and turning the
trump card over. February 28 is our history, it doesn't belong to
political parties.''
   President Lee Teng-hui, the country's first native Taiwanese
leader, has asked his people to forget about the ugly past and look
to the future.
   But, Hou counters: ``If we don't talk about it now, we are
doomed to repeat it.''

   Federal bureaucrats and private insurers are
scrambling to rework health insurance benefits, adjust premiums and
spread the word that the end is near for Medicare's year-old
catastrophic health care program.
   In addition, millions of senior citizens are refiguring their
expected 1989 tax bills, the Internal Revenue Service is scrapping
Form 8808 before it hits the printing press, and states are trying
to figure out how they will cover an extra $300 million to $400
million in health care expenses for the poor.
   The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act _ expected to cost $48
billion in its first five years _ was enacted with fanfare in 1988
to protect 33 million elderly and disabled people against financial
ruin from the staggering costs of prolonged illness.
   But even before most of the benefits took effect, Congress voted
last month to dismantle the program because of a firestorm of
protest from senior citizens who complained it cost them too much.
President Bush has promised to sign the repeal measure.
   Under repeal, the Health Care Financing Administration must take
back the extended hospitalization and nursing home coverage it has
offered Medicare beneficiaries for the past year and scrap plans to
provide expanded coverage of drug and doctor bills and other
medical expenses.
   Louis B. Hays, the acting HCFA administrator, said a top
priority for the agency is to get notices out to Medicare
beneficiaries explaining the new limits on their hospital and
nursing home benefits.
   ``We want to make sure that there isn't confusion,'' Hays said.
   The agency also can forget about providing additional medical
benefits that ``we had invested enormous energy and time in
preparing to implement,'' he said.
   The IRS and the Social Security Administration, meanwhile, have
the tasks of rolling back the income tax surcharge on the elderly
and the extra Medicare premium that financed the catastrophic
program. The surtax was canceled completely; the extra premium will
be scrapped at the end of the year.
   IRS spokesman Henry Holmes said taxpayers will be instructed to
ignore two lines on this year's 1040 tax forms _ lines 54 and 55 _
which refer senior citizens to the elusive Form 8808 that never got
beyond the prototype stage.
   Higher-income senior citizens would have used 8808 to calculate
their added income tax liability for the Medicare benefits. Senior
citizens who paid extra amounts in quarterly income tax payments or
through wage withholding to cover the Medicare surtax will get any
overpayments back as part of their income tax refund, Holmes said.
   About 40 percent of the elderly would have paid some surtax _
$22.50 for every $150 of federal income tax liability _ with about
6 percent paying the maximum amount of $800 per person this year.
   Scrapping the tax is the type of last-minute change it is easy
to spring on taxpayers, Holmes said.
   ``Everybody enjoys hearing news that they don't have to pay a
tax that was on the books,'' he said.
   The Social Security Administration, meanwhile, is complaining
that Congress did not give the agency enough lead time to stop
withholding extra Medicare premiums that helped finance the
catastrophic benefits. It may be April or May before extra payments
of about $5.30 a month no longer are deducted from Social Security
checks, with the overpayments to be refunded later. The premiums of
$4 a month during 1989 will not be refunded.
   ``The bottom line is that Social Security will unscramble this
egg, but we did not lay it,'' said Social Security Commissioner
Gwendolyn King.
   The repeal also is causing last-minute maneuvering among private
insurers who will pick up some of the benefits being canned by the
government. About 70 percent of elderly Americans purchase private
``medigap'' insurance to fill the gaps in their Medicare coverage.
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has until
Dec. 15 to draft transition regulations for medigap policies, and
private insurers have until Jan. 30 to revise their policies and
premiums and notify policyholders of the changes. Any changes,
however, will be retroactive to Jan. 1, when the government
benefits expire.
   ``Insurance companies are doing their best, they're just
grumbling about how long it took Congress to make up their mind,''
said Alan Richards of the Health Insurance Association of America.
``It's kind of a `We'll muddle through' situation. We just hope
Congress doesn't change their mind again next year.''
   The association has estimated medigap premiums will rise 20
percent to 25 percent next year due to the combined effects of
rising medical costs and the repeal of the catastrophic package.
   Fallout from the repeal also is reaching state governments. The
repeal legislation left in place expanded Medicaid costs for the
states, while scrapping provisions that would have offset some of
the new expenses, said Alicia Pelrine of the National Governors'
Association.
   ``Grumbling is probably a tame word to describe what is going on
out there,'' Ms. Pelrine said. ``States are already so maxed out on
their ability to accommodate various (federal) mandates ... that a
lot are saying, `We don't know how we're going to pay for this.' ''
   Gerald Miller, executive director of the National Association of
State Budget Officers, said the original catastrophic legislation
would have cost states $900 million, but the repeal bill boosts
those costs by an additional $300 million to $400 million.

   From discos to dormitories and hotels,
authorities are stepping up moves to limit foreigners' contacts
with Chinese.
   Black sedans without license plates and full of security men
have been parked outside the U.S. Embassy recently. Plainclothes
police and surveillance cameras are being increased elsewhere to
keep track of who's meeting whom.
   ``Police are cracking down on Chinese girls who meet with
foreigners,'' said a clothing saleswoman who is obliged to attend
meetings where workers denounce ``American imperialism.''
   ``It doesn't matter if you're just friends or colleagues,
they'll just assume the girl's a prostitute,'' she said.
   The stepped-up monitoring comes amid a crackdown on
prostitution, increased warnings about AIDS and general wariness of
associating with foreigners since the military crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in June.
   The Chinese government claims the June turmoil was instigated
with foreign help.
   In November, the Culture Ministry canceled a planned exhibition
at the French Embassy of a Chinese painter, and this month police
halted plans by the Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing to show
works by six Chinese artists.
   Western diplomats and journalists have been turned down for
routine interviews and meetings by numerous government ministries
and think tanks. A well-known ``English corner'' in a public park
where people gathered on Sundays to practice English also has been
banned.
   Diplomats and foreign journalists have long lived in special
compounds with armed guards and surveillance cameras. Entering
taxis are checked for Chinese, who are supposed to be screened by
the guards.
   A year ago large cameras were installed at the compounds' main
entrances and inside elevators. Reporters who inquired about the
measures were told they were taken because African children had
beaten Chinese staff workers.
   Workmen last month installed more video cameras at the
compounds, and two weeks ago security agents of the Diplomatic
Service Bureau, which provides staff for embassies and foreign
press bureaus, began staking out apartment entrances.
   ``They're here to stop some of the foreigners who are bringing
girls back to their apartments,'' a utility worker for the
diplomatic bureau said. ``It's part of the `Sweep Out the Six
Evils' campaign.''
   Beijing began the Six Evils campaign some months ago to wipe out
prostitution, gambling, drug use, selling women and children,
pornography and belief in superstition.
   Police have stepped up monitoring of discotheques at posh hotels
such as the Palace in central Beijing. ``There have been more than
10 plainclothes police here every day since late November,'' a
hotel employee said.
   ``Whenever they see a Chinese girl with a foreigner, they
separate them and quiz them about what the other person's name is,
what their job is,'' the employee said. ``If their answers don't
match that means they just met. That's how they catch them.''
   The disco is frequented by ``professionals,'' some of whom
appear almost every night with different partners, said the
employee, who saw one Chinese woman being taken away in handcuffs
last month.
   Punishment for prostitution is strictly enforced, and a few
foreigners have been expelled from China for buying sex. Monitoring
of AIDS has been strengthened in recent months, and an unidentified
foreigner with AIDS was expelled from China in September.
   A receptionist at a major Chinese-run hotel was fired recently
for being friendly with an Arab guest.
   ``My boss brought out videos taken by the security cameras of me
talking to the guest and accused me of making friends with a
foreigner,'' the woman said. ``He would just come over and talk to
me. I thought it was fun to practice English.''
   University students, who led the pro-democracy movement that was
crushed by the army, are uneasy about foreign contacts. One student
of Beijing Normal University declined to see an American friend
because she believed being seen with a foreigner might jeopardize
her application for a passport to study overseas.
   Chinese students live in dormitories segregated from foreign
students and researchers.
   ``It's a big trouble to go visit foreign students,'' said a
student at Beijing University. ``You have to register, leave your
I.D. card downstairs, then leave by 10 p.m.''

   A truck carrying people home from thermal
baths in a remote area of the Andes Mountains tumbled off a
mountain road and down a ravine near the Colca River, killing 35
people, police say.
   The accident occurred Saturday night near the village of Chivay,
50 miles north of Arequipa. Police said the victims had spent the
day at hot springs in the mountains and were returning home to
Chivay.
   Police said they did not know how many people had been in the
truck.
   It was the second major truck accident in a week in Peru.
Nineteen people were killed and 21 injured on Dec. 3 when a truck
carrying fans and members of a soccer team crashed near Nazca, 310
miles southeast of Lima.
   The upper Colca River region where Saturday's accident occurred
is a rugged, sparsely populated area more than 11,000 feet above
sea level, 550 miles southeast of Lima.

<TEXT>
   In a vast sea of arms outstretched
in victory, Zdenek Machon joined in singing the national anthem,
but, choking on emotion, he could barely get out the words.
   ``I can look people directly in the eye now, people from other
countries,'' he said. ``We are a free people again. We are part of
Europe again.''
   Machon was among 100,000 Czechoslovaks who on Sunday returned to
Wenceslas Square where only three weeks ago they first gathered to
tell the Communist Party that, after 41 years, enough was enough.
On Sunday, they celebrated the naming of the first non-Communist
dominated government since 1948.
   He is a big man with a thick mustache, but he showed no
embarrassment at the tears trickling down his face. It was the
students who first rose up, and Machon has three in his family.
   ``I am so thankful to my children for setting us free,'' he
said. ``And I am so happy that they can now live their lives in
freedom.''
   From the towering statue of King Wenceslas on horseback to the
gates of Prague's medieval Old Town, the distance of eight football
fields end to end, Czechoslovaks shared the same thoughts.
   There were speeches and chants, but their message was all in
their moist, red eyes.
   ``You have to understand how we felt in 1968,'' said Machon, now
47. ``We had one child then, and now we have three. Life will be
different now.''
   In 1968, a Soviet invasion brought an abrupt halt to the
Czechoslovaks' last try for freedom. The people's only weapon were
the ``V'' signs they aimed at the tanks.
   The next morning, the Communist Party daily, Rude Pravo, carried
a picture of resisting crowds, with each person holding up two
fingers. The caption said they were threatening to attack Socialist
troops in two minutes.
   This time, there was no confusion over the ``V'' victory sign.
At the first strains of the national anthem, Machon's two thick
fingers were joined by 200,000 others.
   At every chant, he leaned over to translate for a foreign
reporter, eager that the world not miss any part of
Czechoslovakia's triumph. His wife beamed and nodded happily.
   ``How can I explain what this means?'' said Machon, who is a
geophysicist. ``When I went abroad to meetings, I could not look at
people. We were different, inferior, ashamed.''
   When a Frenchwoman spoke from the fourth-floor balcony,
delivering a message of support from European theater groups, he
glowed. After she finished, the crowd chanted, ``Merci, Merci.''
   The setting said as much as Machon's explanation.
   Throughout four decades of Communist Party rule, Czechoslovaks
spoke in private of whom they were and what they would be again
someday.
   Machon knew Sunday was that day.
   With the crowd, he chanted, ``We want Havel!'' demanding the
now-vacant presidency for Vaclav Havel, the playwright who spent
four of the last 20 years in prison for insisting on exposing the
hypocrisy and brutality of Communist rule.
   As with Masaryk and others after him, Czechoslovaks in crisis
rallied to a man of letters rather than a politician.
   ``It is a wonderful day, wonderful,'' Machon said. ``How can I
say it?'' Instead of trying, he hugged the reporter and wept again.

   Bison that blunder over the line from
Yellowstone National Park are fair game for hunters again this
winter, but park officials expect the harvest to be smaller than
the 500 taken last season.
   Just how many of the big, furry, dumb beasts will wander outside
the park boundaries to graze depends on how severe the winter is
and how pinched the food supply within the park, officials say.
Hunters aren't allowed to shoot buffalo in the park.
   But statements by a leading zoologist have added weight to the
state's contention that the slaughter of wandering bison is
necessary to prevent the spread of brucellosis among Montana cattle
herds, despite the outrage such killings may produce.
   Dr. Don Davis, a Texas A&amp;M University specialist in the highly
infectious bacterial disease, said previous claims by park
officials that the bison bug could not be transmitted to cattle
have proven false.
   ``Montana has spent in excess of $260 million of federal and
state money to rid the domestic livestock of brucellosis,'' Davis
said. ``So you can see why you're not real crazy to get it back
again.''
   Davis, scientific adviser to a committee on brucellosis in
Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, said the National Park Service could do
more to eradicate brucellosis in the Yellowstone herds by isolating
and slaughtering infected bison.
   But that would mean killing the animals on park property, and
that isn't going to happen, he said.
   ``We're talking big-time political and economic concessions if
they were to do that,'' Davis said.
   The Park Service says that unless scientists can prove
brucellosis was not in the park when Yellowstone was created in
1872, it may classify the bacteria as a ``native species.'' Park
policy forbids eradication of any native species.
   Eradicating brucellosis from the buffalo herd could prove
useless if the organism is native to the area and simply reinfects
the animals, said Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. And the
buffalo would no longer be a wild, free-roaming species if they
were treated like domestic cattle, she said.
   Brucellosis, also called Bang's disease, causes domestic cattle
to lose their calves. It can cause undulant fever _ characterized
by recurring fever and aching joints _ in humans who get it through
unpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals. It
generally can't be transmitted through meat.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department has been trying for decades to
eliminate the disease from commercial herds. So far, USDA says, 27
states are free of brucellosis, with the disease most prevalent in
the South. Brucellosis was eradicated from Montana cattle in 1984.
   Last year, due to food shortages caused by the massive 1988
forest fires and an ensuing harsh winter, hundreds of hungry bison
wandered north onto Montana cattle ranches.
   Hunters were called in to snag strays, and a record 569 bison
were killed. Of these about half were found to be infected with
brucellosis. Park officials counted 418 buffalo in the northern
herd last week and estimate a park total of about 2,000 animals in
the park's three major herds.
   Wyoming, where most of Yellowstone is located, does not permit
the shooting of stray bison.
   Animal rights activists sought unsuccessfully to stop last
year's hunt, which to some was sadly reminiscent of the massive
buffalo slaughter of a century ago that signalled the final taming
of the Wild West.
   Although the bison season legally began Oct. 1, it does not
actually start until and unless bison begin leaving the park. That
usually happens in December, although it may not happen at all if
the winter is mild.
   ``The biologists can't predict whether they'll move as they did
last year,'' Anzelmo said. ``We hope not. Maybe only a few will
leave the park.''
   Previously officials have said they expect no more than 200 to
be harvested this year.
   In preparation for the hunt, 3,217 people have paid $5 to apply
for a bison permit. If summoned by the wildlife department to hunt,
Montanans pay $200 for a license, while non-residents pay $1,000.
   The hunt itself is less than thrilling. Buffalo are accustomed
to seeing humans, and game wardens lead each hunter directly to the
animal to be killed. The hunters shoot at close range at animals
that often are standing still, grazing.

   Three men who held the most powerful
jobs in the West Virginia Senate face stiff prison terms and fines
this week after being snared in a corruption investigation that
swept through the Legislature.
   Former Senate President Larry Tucker and former Majority Leader
Si Boettner go before U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. on
Wednesday. Former Senate President Dan Tonkovich faces sentencing
Thursday.
   The three, all Democrats, are the latest West Virginia public
officials to fall to investigations by U.S. Attorney Mike Carey.
   Carey, 35, also has nailed a House of Delegates member, a top
Senate aide and two lobbyists on various corruption charges. And he
obtained an indictment of a Charleston-area dog track owner who
allegedly fed some of the corruption with dollars bet at the track.
   West Virginia already was reeling from two forced resignations
this summer. Treasurer A. James Manchin stepped down to avoid a
state Senate trial on articles of impeachment after he was
disgraced over the loss of $279 million in a state investment fund.
Attorney General Charlie Brown quit after conceding he changed his
testimony during child custody proceedings.
   Carey says his work isn't over yet, but he repeatedly has
declined to elaborate.
   ``These cases do show the system is corruptible, as are most
systems of government,'' Carey said.
   Carey's investigations have caused consternation in the
Statehouse, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 30-4 in the
Senate and 80-20 in the House.
   Senate President Keith Burdette has asked Carey to conclude the
investigation as soon as possible. ``It makes my job tougher,''
said Burdette, who at age 34 took over from Tucker as Senate
president.
   ``It's undermined the public's confidence in state government,''
Burdette said. He supports the investigations, however.
   ``I think it's a necessary purge of that element of public
officials in West Virginia,'' said House Speaker Chuck Chambers.
   Tucker, 54, who spent 18 years in the Legislature before
becoming Senate president in 1988, resigned and pleaded guilty
Sept. 11 to extorting $10,000 from dog track interests. He faces
fines of $250,000 and 20 years in prison.
   Tucker's plea briefly interrupted the extortion trial of
Tonkovich, 43, Senate president from 1984 to 1987, when he left the
Senate for an unsuccessful bid for governor. Tucker then became a
prosecution witness against Tonkovich.
   Tucker admitted that he had pocketed $10,000. The scandal cost
him a job as a bank executive vice president.
   Three days later, Tonkovich pleaded guilty to extorting $5,000
from casino gambling interests in return for help on a bill to
legalize gaming. The bill was not passed.
   Witnesses testified that Tonkovich's aide, Bob Cain, had pressed
them for campaign donations. Cain admitted being part of a
laundering scheme to get $15,000 in gaming money for Tonkovich.
   Cain and track and insurance lobbyist Bonnie Wymer pleaded
guilty to federal income tax charges and both testified against
Tonkovich. Cain and Wymer were sentenced to probation Thursday.
   Last December, state Delegate Bob McCormick was convicted of
extortion. Lobbyist John Vandergrift revealed he paid money to
McCormick for help on a bill, and also said he lavished $160,000 on
the Legislature in three years.
   Vandergrift, lobbyist for a group of foreign doctors who sought
to ease restrictions on their obtaining U.S. medical licenses,
pleaded guilty to a federal income tax charge and spent less than
six months in prison. He admitted he had not filed income tax
returns for 16 years.
   Boettner pleaded guilty Sept. 23 to federal charges of income
tax evasion for taking money from the same lobbyist who paid off
Tucker. Boettner, who faces 20 years in prison and fines of
$250,000, also testified against Tonkovich.
   The lobbyist, Sam D'Annunzio, committed suicide Dec. 4, 1988,
police said.
   Facing a February trial is dog track owner Bill Ellis. He is
alleged to have paid $10,000 to Tucker and offered $13,000 to
Tonkovich through D'Annunzio for help on a bill that increased his
track's take by $1.1 million.

   Doctors reattached the scalp of a woman
after it was ripped off when her hair got tangled in a machine at a
yarn mill.
   Sheila Mobbs, 33, was in satisfactory condition Sunday, and was
moved out of an intensive care unit at University Hospitals, said a
nursing supervisor who would only give her name as Kay.
   The accident occurred Friday at the Leesburg Yarn Mill in
northeastern Alabama, where Mrs. Mobbs works.
   Mrs. Mobbs' husband, Jimmy, said his wife didn't know how the
accident occurred, but she fell and her ponytail became entwined in
the spinning machine.
   The Gaylesville woman was taken to Birmingham along with her
scalp, which was transported in a sealed container.
   Mrs. Mobbs underwent a 14-hour operation at University
Hospitals, Mobbs said.
   ``The doctors said it went well,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration Considering New Fees on Generic Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration plans to propose that
generic drug companies pay ``user fees'' to help beef up government
regulation of an industry reeling from a bribery and fraud scandal,
sources say.
   The plan drafted by the Food and Drug Administration would
impose registration fees on generic drug makers and charge them
another fee for each application they file, said a source who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   The fees would raise about $18 million as part of a $144 million
package of FDA fees the administration plans to propose in its
fiscal 1991 budget, the source said.
   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration, favors
user fees because they raise money without raising taxes. Plans to
extend these fees to the drug industry have been proposed before,
only to be axed by opponents on Capitol Hill.
   But this time, a plan directed at the generic drug industry is
believed to have better chances, largely because of disclosures
this year that some generic drug makers have bribed FDA officials,
cheated on safety tests and otherwise sidestepped FDA regulations.
   ``There has been some Hill concern about the ability of the FDA
to do its job,'' said one source at the Department of Health and
Human Services, which includes FDA. ``I think you'll find they're
more receptive to talking about FDA user fees than talking about
user fees in general.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, demonstrates some evidence of
a shift in opinion. His panel uncovered the problems that have led
to the bribery convictions of several generic drug company
executives and FDA employees and the recall of more than 80 generic
drugs.
   Dingell, who has opposed user fees, ``is increasingly coming to
favor them'' for the generic drug industry, as long as the money
raised is used exclusively to strengthen the generic drug approval
system, said an aide to the congressman who spoke on the condition
he not be identified by name.
   The generic drug industry opposes the plan, which would hit
generic companies only _ not brand name drug makers _ with a
registration fee of about $6,000 on each company and another charge
of about $17,000 for each generic drug application they submit for
FDA review.
   ``It's like putting a tax on one side of the industry because of
a couple of wrongdoers,'' said Dee Fensterer, president of the
Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association.
   She said the fees could add up to ``a substantial amount of
money,'' especially if the companies had to pay the application fee
for each dosage of the same product. ``It starts to be very
expensive.''
   She added that ``any user fee is going to get passed on'' to
consumers in the form of a price increase. Though she could not say
how much the fees might add to the cost of a generic drug, she said
it would not be large enough to make generics less competitive with
the more expensive brand name products.
   The makers of brand name products also oppose user fees, even
when the costs are imposed only on their competitors.
   Many say if the generic fees are approved it would only be a
matter of time before a similar plan were imposed on the name brand
companies.
   In a letter to HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan earlier this fall,
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, representing brand
name makers, said the fees are unjustified because they ``would
constitute the collection of revenues for services performed for

of an applicant or registrant.''

<HEAD>State Senator Collects 70 Percent of Delegates in Louisiana Caucuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Sen. Ben Bagert easily outdistanced
state Rep. David Duke and Secretary of State Fox McKeithen in GOP
caucuses across Louisiana, giving him a boost in his bid to oppose
incumbent U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnson.
   Bagert won 383, or 70 percent, of the 544 delegates selected at
14 caucuses Saturday.
   Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader whose election to the
Legislature last year was opposed by national Republican Party
leaders, won 27 delegates. McKeithen won 25 and 109 of the
delegates were uncommitted.
   ``Folks who supported us today have given us a tremendous boost
in our quest to defeat Johnston,'' Bagert said Saturday.
   Nearly half of the 1,200 delegates to the GOP's Jan. 13 state
convention in New Orleans were chosen Saturday. Another 660 are
party officials.
   Bagert's strong showing does not mean he has the nomination for
the fall 1990 election locked up. Delegates' pledges of support are
not binding.
   ``You need the credibility of the party behind you. It gives you
a stamp of approval,'' Bagert said.
   Formal endorsement against Johnston, a Democrat, also would mean
Republican support in the form of money, newsletters and volunteers.
   Both Bagert and McKeithen have said they'd drop out of the race
if they didn't win GOP nomination. Duke has said he'll run even if
he isn't endorsed.
   ``Bagert was by far the strongest candidate,'' said Darryl
Gissel, state Republican Party director.
   Duke, who said he does not expect the party's endorsement,
blamed his weak showing on limited time to drum up support.
   ``We've organized this thing for three days. They've been at it
for three months.'' Duke said. ``I'm encouraged, given the time we
spent on it.
   McKeithen could not be reached for comment at his office or his
home.

<HEAD>Capital Fears the Impact of Defense Cuts on the Industry's Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuts in defense spending won't hurt the
economy, analysts say, but could be traumatic for a workforce
accustomed to satisfying a single complacent customer _ the
Pentagon _ instead of the competitive marketplace.
   A third of the nation's engineers and scientists work in defense
and by some estimates 26 million people depend on the military
economy, so there's considerable concern in Washington about the
recoil that will be felt the defense budget is sharply reduced, as
seems likely.
   Analyst William W. Kaufmann of Harvard University and the
Brookings Institution thinks defense spending could be half its
current size in 10 years.
   Both the new era opened by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at Malta and the pressures of the deficit
point to dismantling the Reagan Era defense buildup. John Ruby,
chief operating officer of Ford Aerospace, says a number of firms
are already planning ``downsizing.''
   Some economists say the government also should be designing
retraining, counseling, job search and relocation programs to ease
the transition for defense workers.
   ``We put over a billion and a half dollars into building planes
we didn't need'' to preserve jobs, says Lawrence J. Korb, who was
an assistant defense secretary in the Reagan administration.
   ``I'd like to see the government come up with a plan to help
people in a graceful and humane way, but you talk about an
industrial policy in this country and they call you a communist,''
he says.
   Congress' Joint Economic Committee is looking at the issue. It
has scheduled hearings for Tuesday on ``the economic consequences
of reduced defense spending and the winding down of the Cold War.''
   ``Depending on its size and speed, a substantial cut in defense
spending phased in over a number of years could be one of the best
things that could happen to the economy and should not be looked on
as something likely to cause recession or unemployment,'' says
Charles Schultze, who was President Carter's chief economic adviser.
   ``One thing this country does not have is a surplus of is
skilled engineers and skilled workmen.''
   But conversion of defense workers, technicians, managers and
plants to the civilian economy will be trickier than it was after
World War II, when Detroit stopped making tanks and resumed making
DeSoto automobiles without missing a step. There was enormous
pent-up demand for civilian products, too.
   But government planners cite society's needs _ for environmental
cleanup, recycling of plastics, health care _ which may be able to
adopt defense industry technology.
   ``I hope trade associations will see the relationship between a
mayor who is worried about defense cuts in his community and about
waste management; if you're smart, you can walk in and say, `I can
solve them both at once,''' says John Tepper Marlin of the Council
on Economic Priorities.
   Defense managers have grown accustomed to working in the
hothouse environment of Pentagon contracting, with no competition
from overseas, a single, cooperative customer and cost-plus-profit
accounting.
   ``Defense contractors are used to being told what the market
is,'' says consultant Jacques Gansler, author of ``Affording
Defense'' and a Pentagon procurement official in 1972-77. ``The
commercial world isn't like that.''
   But Seymour Melman, retired professor of industrial engineering
at Columbia University and a pioneer advocate of planned
conversion, rejects the view that the economy can absorb defense
budget cuts without severe dislocations.
   He argues for an elaborate government efforts to prepare defense
workers and to create productive civilian jobs for them.
   ``What are they going to work at?'' he demands. ``Making shoes?
Eight-five percent of our shoes are imported. Consumer electronics?
All imported. Machine tools? Half are imported.''
   Moreover, Melman argues, defense managers are incapable of
making the leap without retraining.
   ``No major military-serving enterprise has demonstrated an
autonomous ability to carry out the sort of occupational switch
that is needed to go civilian,'' Melman wrote in his book,
``Profits Without Production.''
   ``If you unleash these people, the U.S. will turn into a
third-rate economy,'' Melman says. ``They can't hack it. We will
lose the capability of repairing the damage.''
   Under a conversion legislation sponsored by Rep. Ted Weiss,
D-N.Y., defense contractors would be required to put 1.25 percent
of receipts into a fund to pay the costs of economic adjustment.
Laid-off workers might get 90 percent of their lost salaries while
they are retrained for civilian jobs.
   Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a
Washingon research outfit, says, ``Workers find work when the
economy is healthy; you can plan the dickens out of what to do with
a worker but when we're in a recession you can't do anything for
him.''
   Adams says although counseling, retraining and relocation
programs are critical, ``income supplements, however, slow the
adjustment process.''

   Nicaragua proposed at a gathering of
Central American presidents Sunday that U.N. observers in the
region be given new powers and personnel to start disbanding the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels, a Nicaraguan source said.
   But after the summit's first day, the Nicaraguans were no closer
to getting agreement on their proposal.
   ``Nothing has been done,'' Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto of
Nicaragua told reporters after the day's session had ended.
   ``The demobilization of the Contras must be complied with,'' he
said. ``The United Nations must begin to function in Nicaragua.''
   Also Sunday, the Salvadoran government rejected a truce proposed
by leftist rebels fighting in that country.
   In return for demobilization of the Contras, the Nicaraguan
government would consider resuming its cease-fire and ``technical
talks'' with the leadership of the Honduras-based rebels, said a
Nicaraguan source after the opening of the two-day summit.
   The source close to the Nicaraguan delegation, who refused to be
identified, also said Nicaragua was willing to allow the U.N. group
to verify that no weapons are sent from Nicaragua to El Salvador's
leftist rebels.
   The U.N. observers were approved four months ago to monitor the
voluntary repatriation of the Contras and make sure that one
country's territory was not being used to launch attacks on a
neighbor.
   The source, however, said the Nicaraguan government was not
optimistic about acceptance of the proposal in view of the United
States' ``bipartisan decision to keep the Contras alive until after
the February elections in Nicaragua.''
   Nicaragua canceled its cease-fire with the Contras on Nov. 1,
accusing them of disrupting registration for the Feb. 25 elections.
   Also at Sunday's opening session, the Salvadoran government
rejected a cease-fire proposal by the leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   The rebels asked for the dismissal of seven high-ranking
military leaders in El Salvador and ``full respect for human rights
and democratic liberties of political and social organizations.''
   The Salvadoran government instead asked the rebels to make a
commitment not to launch attacks in urban areas and offered to
resume negotiations in Venezuela.
   Costa Rica proposed a truce in El Salvador from Dec. 12 through
Jan. 15 ``to give the FMLN and the government time to begin
negotiations for a permanent cease-fire.'' Costa Rica also proposed
that the United Nations be given powers to verify such a cease-fire
in El Salvador.
   The five Central American presidents opened their meeting in an
atmosphere of frustration and pessimism, hoping the superpowers
would help rescue the flagging peace efforts in the region.
   ``We must face that reality'' that the superpowers' help is
needed, said Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal, who
commented on the presidents' discussions. He added that regional
agreements will not have much validity in those places where
parties in the conflicts have close ties to the United States and
the Soviet Union.
   Attending the summit are presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica,
Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala, Jose
Azcona Hoyo of Honduras and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.
   The presidents met briefly in a conference room, listened to a
welcoming speech by Costa Rican Information Minister Jorge Urbina,
and then went into a private session.
   Arias on Saturday had called the superpowers, without naming the
United States and Soviet Union, ``two-faced.'' He said they spoke
about political solutions while encouraging military activities.
   ``We must demand from them a definition of their roles, what
they have done themselves or through other countries to exert a
negative or positive influence in the region,'' Madrigal said.
   He did not suggest how the superpowers might respond, but one
source, speaking with the condition of anonymity, said the two
might send representatives or observers to negotiations between the
warring parties.
   The United States supports the Nicaraguan rebels fighting the
leftist Sandinista government. It also backs El Salvador in its
civil war against leftist insurgents. Washington accuses the Soviet
Union and Cuba of providing arms and aid to Nicaragua and the
Salvadoran rebels.
   This summit had been scheduled to be held in Nicaragua, but it
was changed to San Jose when El Salvador suspended relations with
Nicaragua last month.
   El Salvador took the action after two small planes were found in
El Salvador carrying surface-to-air rockets that Cristiani said
were being flown from Nicaragua to the FMLN. One plane crashed and
the other was burned at a rural airstrip.
   Agreements reached at an August summit in Tela, Honduras, called
for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to disband by Dec. 5. However,
their forces, headquartered in camps in Honduras, have remained in
place.

   Paint Branch Elementary School, under
court order to desegregate, became a magnet school 2{ years ago and
attracted so many affluent children that it lost its federal funds
to help the disadvantaged members of its original student body.
   In solving one problem, the magnet system created another _ how
to retain services in the face of lost funds under the federal
Chapter One program, which provides money for extra teachers and
supplies to qualifying schools.
   It is a predicament experienced by magnet schools around the
country _ including many of the 44 here in Prince George's County
outside Washington, D.C.
   Magnet schools provide specialized instruction in math, science,
foreign languages and other areas. The idea has been pushed by
administrators as a way to desegregate by attracting students
voluntarily to schools away from their homes.
   President Bush is pushing to expand the concept nationwide as
part of his effort to improve learning in America.
   As of August, the Education Department awarded 54 grants
totaling $113.6 million for magnet programs in 25 states. This
compares with 38 federal grants totaling $75 million two years ago.
   Education Undersecretary Ted Sanders acknowledged that some
magnet schools are losing Chapter One funds but insisted the
problem is not widespread. He said there are no immediate plans to
revise the law.
   However, Bush and the nation's governors pledged during the
education summit to try and eliminate the stringent federal
regulations attached to the Chapter One program.
   Before becoming a magnet school, Paint Branch was declared
eligible for the federal funds because a large percentage of its
350-member student body qualified for the school lunch program and
scored poorly on academic achievement tests. But when it began
offering specialized instruction in math or science, 200 students
were bused in, the student body swelled to 540 and the percentage
of disadvantaged, low achievers dropped.
   Many of the old students were still at the school, but Paint
Branch was told it was no longer eligible for Chapter One money.
   Linda Dudley, the Paint Branch principal, has done some juggling
with budget and staff assignments to offer the advanced instruction
that magnet schools promise, while still providing for the
low-income, low-achieving students in her classrooms.
   ``It's very, very unfortunate,'' said Ms. Dudley. ``Chapter One
is a support program and we argue that support programs should be
delivered one way or another.''
   Ms. Dudley acknowledges, however, that a certain prestige comes
with being a magnet school. The county school system has made these
schools the cornerstone of its aggressive efforts to achieve
academic success for all students.
   Warren Simmons, director of instructional support programs for
the county, sought guidance from the state on how magnet schools
could fight the loss of funds. As a result, about 19 magnet schools
_ described as ``non-dedicated'' because not all of the youngsters
receive the special courses _ are allowed to exclude the more
affluent students from the calculations that determine eligibility
for Chapter One.
   ``In essence, Chapter One regulations still operate and assume
the existence of neighborhood schools _ schools attended by kids in
the surrounding neighborhood,'' said Simmons. ``The money flows to
the community and not the kid.''
   Paint Branch was not among those non-dedicated schools.
   To make up for the loss of federal funds, Ms. Dudley made
staffing changes that resulted in larger physical education and
music classes. An instructional aide was hired with the extra money.
   Ms. Dudley said one benefit of hiring an instructional assistant
without Chapter One money is that the school is not burdened by
strict federal regulations and the instructors can be used more
creatively.
   She also instituted ``dual assignment'' team teaching, where
classes are combined for certain activities so some teachers can be
free to provide extra time to certain Chapter One-eligible students.
   This year, eight second graders were targeted for the school's
first quarter and ``we expect those children to make a good
half-year gain in a short period of time.'' Under Chapter One, 100
youngsters received special educational services.
   ``We needed to create a different way to deliver services, extra
intensive services to some of these children,'' she said. ``What
we're trying is if we can give extraordinary services to a small
group of children, we will have them ready to join the regular
program by the first grading period.''

<HEAD>Report: Classified Study Told Bush of Soviet Reductions in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, who maintained up until a
month ago that Soviet defense spending was growing, received a
classified Pentagon report in May in which U.S. intelligence
analysts expressed the opposite view, according to a published
report.
   The Washington Post reported that Bush ordered the Pentagon
study of U.S. defense strategy shortly after his election for help
in dealing with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A 26-page executive summary of the secret report states ``there
is broad agreement within the U.S. intelligence community'' that
the Soviet Union under Gorbachev ``has decided to reverse a 20-year
pattern of growth in Soviet military spending and force structure
in order to boost the civil economy and Soviet foreign policy,''
the Post said.
   Until a month ago, Bush and senior advisers criticized what they
said was an increase in Soviet defense spending as they pressed
Congress to approve the nearly $300 billion defense budget for
fiscal 1990.
   A White House spokesman interviewed by the Post about the
classified report said, ``When it was written, people were trying
to prognosticate on the basis of Soviet announcements and very
early indications of Soviet behavior. In fact, at that time, our
estimates were that there were few, if any changes.''

   President Bush, in sending two high-level
envoys to smooth U.S. relations with China, is virtually assuring
himself of a new fight with Congress in return for benefits that
remain unclear.
   The trip by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, announced in the middle of
the night Saturday by the White House, made it appear Bush is
retreating from efforts to punish Beijing over last June's bloody
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The move has given new grist to congressional critics who
already had found Bush timid in his response to the Chinese
crackdown, and who now suggest a curious contradiction: a hard-line
Bush when it comes to Soviet human rights policy, but a pushover
for China.
   ``There seems to be a double standard,'' said Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-N.Y., who as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asia
subcommittee is a leading congressional spokesman on the Far East.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III acknowledged Sunday that
topics of discussion between the president's men and the Chinese
leadership include the status of Fang Lizhi, a dissident who has
taken sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since the crackdown.
He declined to say whether any progress was being made toward
freeing Fang.
   Whether progress on that issue or some other potential gain was
Bush's object, the domestic political risks are far more apparent.
Solarz said the president risks abdicating policymaking on China to
Congress, which ``more clearly reflects the will of the American
people.''
   Unless the situation changes, Congress when it returns in
January is likely to force a new confrontation with Bush over
legislation formalizing and perhaps expanding U.S. economic
sanctions against China, and over a bill granting Chinese students
automatic visa extensions if they are in danger of political
persecution at home.
   Bush vetoed both measures in the waning days of the 1989
congressional session. He said he the bills were unnecessary
because he took administrative action to accomplish the same things
and because the bills were an unwarranted intrusion on his foreign
policy prerogatives.
   The Scowcroft-Eagleburger mission was a departure from past U.S.
practice, in which the ``China card'' usually has been played to
gain leverage over the Soviet Union. But at few times in history
has the United States needed leverage less than in the current
climate, as communist rule crumbles in the Soviet sphere of
influence.
   Solarz speculated that Bush and his two envoys, both proteges of
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, ``are living in the
past.''
   ``These guys have a deep personal stake in the Sino-American
relation. Nixon, Kissinger and Bush were all present at the
creation,'' Solarz said. ``They're trying to preserve a
relationship which they created and nurtured and which for a long
time served (the United States) well.''
   The price is the apparent subordination _ at least in this case
_ of the U.S. commitment to human rights. Democrats can be expected
to complain loudly, and conservative Republicans who are uneasy
over Bush's rapprochement with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev could well be brought to a boil by concessions to the
more hard-line Beijing regime.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III sought to defend the move,
saying it was necessary to keep China within ``the international
community.'' And he played down the significance of the trip,
insisting China still must make progress on human rights before
relations can be fully normalized.
   ``We've made it very clear, even in the aftermath of Tiananmen,
that as much as we deplored what happened there this is a very
important relationship in terms of its geopolitical and
geostrategic importance to the United States, and that we wanted to
try and find ways to preserve it,'' Baker said.

   For more than a half-century the desolate
beauty of a huge swamp west of Miami has drawn hunters and outdoors
lovers, who have erected camps in the wilderness.
   In 1974, the swamp became a preserve under the authority of the
National Park Service, and the legal status of those camps _ some
little better than flypaper shacks, others cinder-block structures
with indoor plumbing, gas stoves and even lawns in front of them _
has come into question.
   About 100 people own camps on private land holdings that dot the
Big Cypress National Preserve. But another 156 camps are on land
that is now public property. Armed with a February ruling by a
Miami federal court, the park service has targeted the squatter
camps for demolition.
   ``It really is pure and simple a legal issue,'' said Fred
Fagergren, park service superintendent of the 716,000-acre
preserve, which is just north of Everglades National Park.
   But for the squatters, the future of the camps is a bitter
emotional issue. They are still disputing the ruling and have
written 79 senators in a last-ditch attempt to save their holdings.
   With directions like ``take a right at the two pine trees
deformed by lightning,'' the makeshift camps aren't easy to find.
   License plates tacked to a tree welcome visitors to camps with
names like Firemen's Island, Scorpion Head and Fat Charlie's after
a one-hour airboat ride or a trip of up to four hours on swamp
buggies _ souped-up, customized four-wheel drive trucks.
   But for all its forlorn quality, the land itself inspires the
squatters to considerable eloquence.
   ``I walk out there and I'm in another world. I cannot tell you
spiritually or emotionally what that does. It's heaven,'' said
Sonny Nomes, spokeswoman for a group that has sued to maintain the
squatter camps.
   Nomes recalls a venemous cottonmouth snake that bit a boat
engine, an alligator that attacked a tire, and admits there have
been times when she's said to herself, ``Lady, you've got to be
crazy to be out here.''
   But, ``you see this gorgeous untouched cypress that is so big
around it would take you 50 feet or better to get it around, and
you see this lush pond next to it. It takes your breath away.''
   Nomes, of Miami, said her first two dates with her husband-to-be
were in the Everglades 15 years ago. They've never owned a camp but
have visited friends deep in Big Cypress for holidays, hunting
trips and relaxation.
   The preserve is home to 11 endangered species, notably the
Florida panther, and 395 archaeological sites, primarily Indian
burial mounds. Oil and gas exploration, hunting, off-road vehicles
and cattle grazing are permitted in the preserve. The squatters
hunt deer, turkeys and feral hogs.
   The squatters claim the park service is ignoring congressional
intent by ousting them. No one bothered them when they built their
camps on land titled to other owners before the preserve was
created in 1974 with purchases from 47,000 landowners.
   A handful of camps were torn down earlier this year, but
Fagergren waited for hunting season to die down before launching
widespread demolition this month.
   ``We're being kicked out of the woods. That's what's
happening,'' said Jack Moller, who owns his own camp but fears all
private interests in the preserve are being whittled away. ``The
park service likes everything to be totally regulated, totally
controlled in their back yard, and they don't want to see man's
influence anywhere.''
   The park service plans to build at least 50 primitive camps _
wooden platforms with roofs and screens _ for back-country campers
to use on a first come-first serve basis, as in most of the
nation's public camping areas.
   But Sid Lewis, whose 20-year-old camp was demolished, says he'll
use his own modified four-wheel drive Toyota as a camp on wheels.
   ``There's no way Fred Fagergren or anyone else is going to keep
me out of the swamp. It doesn't make any difference to me if I have
to be in a tent,'' said Lewis, of the Miami suburb of Hialeah. ``I
will continue year round as I always have. I just won't have a camp
to go to.''

   A woman sought for 2{ years on a cocaine
charge may have sent an unsigned letter that bears the essence of
her cat-and-mouse game with her pursuers: ``Nya, nya, nya.''
   The Colorado-postmarked letter that police received recently
carried the defiant, handwritten message next to a rubber-stamp
image of a cat on a fence screeching at the moon, police said.
Because of its taunts, police have linked it to Deborah Ulrich.
   Ulrich, 42, even has returned telephone calls from police,
daring them to arrest her, authorities said.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Lt. Gary Rogness. ``She is very
persistent and bothersome _ bothersome is a real mild way to
describe her.''
   Informants have passed along Ulrich's electronic pager numbers,
Detective Paul True said. He has called the Los Angeles-area
numbers, and Ulrich has returned his calls.
   ``She just kind of laughs and says, `Catch me if you can,'''
said True. ``I've never had one in 18 years call me up and say,
`Catch me if you can.'''
   Ulrich has been sought since June 1987, when officers raided her
apartment and found cocaine with a street value of $85,000, said
True.
   Her husband, Darel Scott Lenhart, was arrested and pleaded
guilty to cocaine possession. He walked away from a drug
rehabilitation program in January 1988 and is being sought,
authorities said.
   ``I think there's a good chance that they will be together,''
True said. ``Maybe we'll get two for the price of one.''

<HEAD>House Panel Says Administration Plays Down Safety of Abortions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion politics at the White House has
``interfered with scientific evidence and research'' on abortion in
the Department of Health and Human Services, the chairman of a
House panel contends.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., charged in a report released Sunday that
the federal government has failed to report evidence of the
relative safety of abortions for women.
   His panel concluded after an investigation that the federal
Centers for Disease Control has censored research on abortion, and
urged that the Department of Health and Human Services take steps
to assure public health research is not affected by politics.
   It also recommended increased federal support for contraceptive
research to help decrease the 1.5 million abortions obtained by
American women every year.
   ``This report provides important evidence of the relative safety
of abortion for women, since more than 90 percent of abortions
performed in the U.S. are much safer than pregnancy and childbirth,
and even the most dangerous types of legal abortions are equal in
risk to carrying a pregnancy to term,'' said Weiss.
   His statement was included with the report by the House
Government Operations Committee, based on an investigation by its
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations,
which Weiss chairs.
   In charging that scientific research by the CDC has been
``restricted by the political considerations'' in the Reagan and
Bush administrations, the committee cited a change in CDC
statistics gathering.
   Five years ago, it said, the CDC stopped comparing the mortality
and morbidity of women who had abortions with women carrying
pregnancy to term. Comparisons had indicated women were between
seven and 25 times more likely to die from childbirth than from
legal abortion, the report said.
   Jim Brown, a spokesman for James Mason, assistant secretary for
health at HHS, said that while Mason was director of CDC from 1983
until last winter, ``there was not censorship on the abortion
issue.''
   Six Republican House members filed a dissent, charging the
report was written with ``pro-abortion bias'' and ``paints a
misleading and inaccurate picture.''
   The panel conducted an investigation into the efforts by the
Reagan administration to have its surgeon general, C. Everett Koop,
prepare a report on the health effects of abortion on women. After
conducting meetings and research, Koop in January wrote to
President Reagan saying there was insufficient information on which
to base a report.
   A draft of Koop's unreleased report was made public by the
subcommittee in March. It concluded that valid scientific studies
have documented that modern abortion is a medically safe procedure
and does not increase a woman's subsequent risk of infertility,
miscarriage or premature births. It concluded the frequency of
long-term psychological effects is uncertain, however.
   In releasing its final report, the panel included material from
transcripts it subpoenaed of 27 confidential meetings Koop held
with anti-abortion and abortion-rights advocates.
   According to the subcommittee, Koop stated in those meetings
that legal abortion was safer than pregnancy and childbirth and
posed no public health risks to women's mental or physical health.
It concluded Koop's letter to Reagan was ``not consistent with the
weight of evidence'' or Koop's own statements on health effects of
abortion.
   Koop did not respond to a reporter's call for comment last week.
   The report cited CDC evidence that the risk of death from
abortion doubles every two weeks after eight weeks gestation, and
that after the 16th week the risks are similar to those for
childbirth.
   Don Berreth, a spokesman for the CDC in Atlanta, declined to
comment on the report Sunday, saying officials there had not seen
it.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister Out To Prove He's In Charge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   V.P. Singh, the man who reluctantly
agreed to become prime minister of India, has set out to prove he's
in control.
   As head of India's first minority government, Singh doesn't have
a blank check to launch the revolutionary economic and social
reforms that could allow India to join the ranks of the great
powers in the next century.
   But political observers and associates say the 58-year-old prime
minister has two things working in his favor _ a clean slate and a
clean name.
   Within a week of taking the oath of office, Singh had reassured
two embittered religious minorities they indeed have an important
place in officially secular, predominantly Hindu India.
   He appointed influential colleagues to lower-ranking Cabinet
posts, thereby denying them new power bases. The more powerful
posts went to men with the experience to push through change and
the reputations for incorruptibility.
   Singh's five-party National Front coalition denied Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party a majority in the Nov. 22-26
elections and brought down the Nehru family dynasty that dominated
Indian politics since the country became independent from Britain
42 years ago.
   But Singh needs the continuing allegiance of both the Hindu
fundamentalists and the Communists for his middle-of-the-road
alliance to muster a majority in Parliament.
   Given the fragilility of this alliance, many political observers
are skeptical of the new government's ability to enact any major
changes in the world's largest democracy, a country of 880 million
people skewed between abject poverty and space-age achievements.
   The problems Singh inherited are enormous, but the
mild-mannered, introverted politician who reluctantly agreed to
head India's newest government has not been shy about what he
intends to accomplish.
   He lists his missions thus: to eliminate poverty, halt rising
food prices that have doubled in the past year, decentralize
federal power, reduce bureaucratic regulations and political
meddling, open the economy to Western investors eager to do
business with India and patch up differences with neighboring
Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
   Foreign policy is a low priority for change.
   Singh has said he will not deviate from the course India has
already charted between the world's superpowers. India, he said,
will remain non-aligned and continue to build on its friendly
relations with Moscow and Washington.
   The first major test of Singh's government _ provided it
survives a confidence vote in Parliament later this month _ will
come during legislative elections in nine states in March and
April. All but two of the states now are dominated by Gandhi's
Congress Party.
   ``If Congress loses, it will split and the National Front
alliance will become stronger. If Congress defends its territory,
it will give renewed confidence to Gandhi and his party and weaken
our coalition. Then any constructive cooperation between us and the
opposition will end,'' said one National Front member, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   But analysts say Singh's most immediate problems stem from
factional disputes within his own Janata Dal, or People's Party,
the largest group in the five-party National Front. Those
differences surfaced again recently during wrangling for Cabinet
posts.
   Singh appointed a Moslem as head of the powerful Home Ministry,
a move seen as an attempt to span the growing rifts between the
majority Hindus and the minority Moslems that erupted into riots in
which at 300 people were killed this fall.
   Later, he visited the northern state of Punjab, the hotbed of
the Sikh separatist movement, and offered prayers at the Sikhs'
holiest shrine, the Golden Temple. The visit by Singh, a Hindu, was
the first by an Indian prime minister in more than five years and
an effort to end the bloody secessionist campaign that has claimed
more than 12,000 lives since 1982.
   ``A nation is not a map on a piece of paper,'' Singh later said.
``It lives in the hearts of the people, and if the hearts are
divided, the nation stands divided. We will not allow this to
happen.''
   Despite speculation that Singh would keep the finance portfolio,
which he held for two years under Gandhi, he gave it to a veteran
lawmaker who is expected to continue, if not speed up, the reforms
Singh sees as needed to make India a competitor in the world
markets.
   Instead, Singh kept the defense portfolio, a signal that he will
wield considerable power since defense spending has received the
biggest chunk of the national budget.
   The move prompted speculation Singh would be directly involved
in investigation into controversial arms deals during the Gandhi
administration.
   Government corruption was the linchpin in the National Front's
campaign against Gandhi and the Congress Party and earned Singh the
nickname, ``The New Mr. Clean,'' a reference to similar promises
that Gandhi made to clean up India's bureacracy.
   Gandhi was buffeted by accusations that highly placed Indians
received up to $50 million in kickbacks from the Swedish arms firm
AB Bofors, winner of a 1986 contract to sell $1.4 billion worth of
howitzers to the Indian government.
   Gandhi's denials that any Indians profited from the Bofors deal
paled before detailed newspaper investigations, but the accusations
have not been proved.
   Singh said there will be an investigation, but not a vendetta.
   ``I want to make it clear that we will not be vindictive,''
Singh said. ``No scandal will be cooked up against him or anyone
else. The law of the land will prevail.''

<HEAD>Rep. Mickey Leland's Successor Talks About Re-Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Sen. Craig Washington was already talking
about being re-elected to Congress shortly after he won a runoff to
fill the unexpired term of Rep. Mickey Leland.
   Washington, 48, said he wants his name added to March's
Democratic primary ballot for the seat, which was left vacant in
August when his fellow Democrat was killed in a plane crash while
on an Ethiopian famine relief mission.
   Washington's opponent in Saturday's runoff, Democrat Anthony
Hall, said he was unsure whether he would contest the race.
   ``I haven't even thought about it,'' said Hall, a 45-year-old
city councilman. ``I'll think about it in the next week or so.''
   Washington won the non-partisan runoff by 57-43 percent.
   The two emerged as the top vote-getters in a field of 11
candidates in the Nov. 7 special election.
   Despite his interest in retaining his new post, Washington said
he won't take his seat until the Texas Legislature settles the
issue of workers' compensation.
   Washington, a 17-year veteran of the Legislature, is a key
backer of a compensation bill favored by workers and opposed by
business.
   Lawmakers are considering the bill in a special session that
ends at midnight Wednesday. Gov. Bill Clements has said he will
extend the session if an agreement isn't reached by then.

   He'll come in out of the sky, then
quickly disappear. Folks here have been looking forward to his
annual visit, and some are even thinking of treats for him to eat.
   Santa?
   No, President Bush.
   For 25 years, Bush has been coming to hunt at the Lazy F ranch
of Will Farish. The annual chase for scurrying quail is scheduled
this year for the week after Christmas.
   Even though he has a complement of press and Secret Service
agents, Bush manages to pull a disappearing act. He arrives at
nearby Chase Field Naval Air Station, then vanishes onto the ranch.
   ``I didn't know he was here last year until after he left,''
said Sherry Cruz, a Bee County courthouse secretary.
   ``Actually, to get to the ranch he hunts on, I don't think he
even comes through town,'' said County Judge Bill Streitman.
   But people have ways of knowing when he's around. For instance,
Rosie Moya stays a little busier at her Moya's Mexican Cafe. She
said she will have to stock extra food and hire extra help again
just to handle the business during this year's three-day visit.
   Last year, Ms. Moya served ``Bush burgers'' with plenty of
jalapenos to the entourage that accompanied the president. The cafe
is the only restaurant in Berclair, a small town northeast of
Beeville that is near Farish's ranch.

<TEXT>
   President Bush says new openings for democracy
and peace around the world make this Christmas ``a moment to be
remembered.''
   ``For 40 years the world has known only a grim and joyless
peace, hard and cold,'' the president said Sunday. ``But now,
everywhere, you see signs of a warmer, more hopeful peace, like a
candle which flickers in the distance. It beckons, encourages,
casts a bright glow in the world's darkest corners.''
   Bush spoke on stage at the end of the taping of an NBC
television special, ``Christmas in Washington,'' that will air Dec.
18.
   Flutist James Galway, singers Diahann Carroll and Olivia
Newton-John, the U.S. Naval Academy glee club and the local Eastern
High School choir provided the entertainment at the National
Building Museum.
   The show kicked off two weeks of parties and celebrations
leading up to Christmas.
   ``Christmas in 1989 will be a moment to be remembered, a moment
of new faith and freedom, new hope for peace,'' said the president,
sporting a red and green tie.
   ``Change comes and challenges us. Freedom comes and lights a
candle that must never be put out,'' said Bush.
   ``Let every candle we light, every hymn we offer, symbolize the
hope of a new century, hope of mankind that there will indeed be
peace on earth, goodwill, and the blessings of freedom for all
people.''
   The event benefited the Children's Hospital National Medical
Center of Washington. The show included taped footage of Mrs. Bush
reading to children at the hospital's Christmas party last
Wednesday.
   The Bushes are hosting a congressional ball at the White House
tonight, kicking off a nearly nightly series of holiday parties
from now until Christmas, which the Bushes will spend at Camp
David, Md.
   Bush will light the national Christmas tree on the Ellipse this
Thursday night, continuing a tradition that President Calvin
Coolidge began in 1923.
   Bush will also host a Hanukkah celebration at the White House on
Dec. 21.

   Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh have long since
died, but at the gala events this week celebrating the 50th
anniverary of ``Gone With the Wind'' they'll be remembered again
and again.
   For one thing, organizers have invited five pairs of Rhett
Butler and Scarlett O'Hara look-alikes.
   For another, 11 survving cast members, many of whom were
children when the 1939 movie was made, will have their own stories
to tell of the legendary stars, who both died in the 1960s.
   The cast members will attend a private reunion Thursday and are
expected Friday night at a re-creation of the movie's Dec. 15,
1939, world premiere.
   Fifty years ago, the premiere was the biggest social event in
the city's history. The governor declared Dec. 15 a holiday, and an
estimated 1 million people turned out to catch glimpses of the
visiting Hollywood royalty and Atlanta's own Margaret Mitchell, the
former newspaper writer whose 1936 novel ``Gone With the Wind''
catapulted her to reluctant celebrity.
   The ``re-premiere'' will be held at the Fox Theater since the
Loew's Grand Theater, site of the 1939 premiere, is no longer
standing.
   A competition between the Rhett and Scarlett look-alikes is set
for Tuesday, and guests in antebellum dress will attend a ``Gone
With the Wind'' ball Thursday night.
   Cammie King Conlon, the actress who played Rhett and Scarlett's
young daughter, Bonnie Blue Butler, said the cast reunion will be a
chance for her to reminisce with others who appeared in the movie.
   ``I was 4{ when they did the filming,'' the Little River,
Calif., resident said in a telephone interview, adding that she
remembers ``about 12 snapshots, images'' of the experience.
   ``You don't really know how much you remember because people
have told you some things,'' she said. ``I certainly remember the
pony.'' In the movie, as in the book, Bonnie dies in a fall from a
pony.
   ``Clark Gable I remember being a very nice, nice `daddy,''' Ms.
Conlon added. ``He was considerate of me, my mother said. I don't
remember Vivien Leigh at all.''
   Others expected for the cast reunion include Butterfly McQueen,
who played Prissy; Patrick Curtis, Ric Holt and Mickey Kuhn, all of
whom played Beau Wilkes, son of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes, at
various ages; Gregg Geiss, who played Bonnie Blue as an infant; and
Ann Rutherford and Evelyn Keyes, who portrayed Scarlett's sisters.
   Many of the anniversary activities are sponsored by Turner Home
Entertainment, a division of entrepreneur Ted Turner's media empire.
   Turner acquired the rights to ``Gone With the Wind'' in 1985
when he bought MGM-UA Entertainment Corp.'s huge film library. He
paid for a restored version of the film that has made a 50th
anniversary tour of U.S. movie houses this year.
   ``It's his favorite movie,'' said Frank Miller, a Turner
spokesman.
   Other activities include a champagne breakfast, which is a
re-creation of an event from the 1939 gala; tours of historic homes
in Atlanta and suburban Clayton County, where Miss Mitchell set her
fictional plantation Tara; an exhibit at the Atlanta Historical
Society; and lectures on Miss Mitchell, who died in 1949, and her
book.
   Turner's SuperStation TBS will broadcast the restored version of
the film three times during the week.

   A campaign march by hundreds of
opposition supporters turned into a riot Sunday. Police said at
least one person was killed and witnesses said 20 people were
injured.
   Two vehicles were burned, and a private home and the local
headquarters of the ruling Sandinista Front were sacked.
   The fighting broke out during a rally by the National Opposition
Union, or UNO, when a group of about 20 Sandinista loyalists and
opposition followers exchanged insults and then blows in this town
of 15,000 people about 30 miles south of Managua.
   Sandinistas accused sympathizers of the opposition coalition of
starting the riot.
   Opposition leaders admitted their people took part but accused
the Sandinistas of provoking the riot, saying Sandinista
infiltrators posing as opposition militants encouraged the attack
on the houses and vehicles.
   The local organizer of the opposition coalition, Jeremias
Mahmud, said he saw a police officer draw his gun and shoot a man
in the arm.
   Lt. Fernando Montoya, the Masatepe police chief, said police
were following orders in not intervening in the riot until it was
nearly over.
   ``We had instructions not to get near the march,'' Montoya said.
``Going to the disturbances meant giving them (UNO) a pretext to
say that we were there to repress them.''
   National Opposition Union leaders have accused Sandinista gangs
of disrupting earlier opposition rallies for the Feb. 25 elections.
   Montoya said one person was killed, but did not elaborate.
Witnesses said at least 20 people were injured.
   Witnesses said groups of opposition activists attacked a house
that was used by the Sandinistas as a campaign office as well as
another nearby house. They said some activists set fire to a
motorcycle and to a jeep with license plates from the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization.
   Mahmud, the opposition coalition organizer, said he arrived as
opposition sympathizers were stoning the Sandinista headquarters.
He said a Sandinista from the nearby town of La Concepcion was
leading the mob.
   ``I told them that this man was an infiltrator and they beat him
up,'' Mahmud said. ``In the fray, he dropped this pin and I grabbed
it and showed it to them.''
   Mahmud showed an enamel-and-gold pin commemorating the 10th
anniversary of the Sandinista revolution. Such pins are awarded by
the Sandinista Front for meritorious service to the party.
   He said the man, whose name he did not know, fled.
   Mahmud said by the time he tried to calm the mob, police had
arrived. He said a 9-year-old girl who was walking next to him
during the march was hit on the head by a rock ``which was meant
for me'' and she was knocked out.
   He said at least three men were stabbed and other people were
attacked with broken bottles and hit with stones and sticks.
   Ricardo Lopez Cerda, a Sandinista campaign committee member,
said he and 12 other people were in the party headquarters when it
was attacked by a mob of about 200 people. He said they escaped
through a back room.
   After destroying furniture and other articles in the Sandinista
headquarters, the crowd moved to the second building, allowing its
occupants to leave before stoning it.
   Both buildings were heavily damaged.

<HEAD>Aquino Shows Resolve In Coup Aftermath But No Sign Of Compromise</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino has shown
steely resolve in confronting the armed challenge to her rule. But
it is unclear whether she is ready to move quickly on the manifold
problems that helped trigger the latest coup attempt.
   On Saturday, rebel soldiers gave up the last stronghold they
seized Dec. 1, when thousands of military mutineers rose up against
her in Manila, Cebu City, Legazpi and elsewhere.
   But the crisis facing the Aquino government is far from over.
More than half the estimated 3,000 rebels who battled government
troops in the Manila area remain at large, including key leaders
such as Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina and renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan.
   Troops who did not join the revolt issued statements of support.
The grave social and political problems the mutineers tried to
exploit remain unaddressed.
   In one indication of the mood, share prices tumbled on the
Manila Stock Exchange today in the first day of trading since the
coup attempt was launched. The Manila Composite Stock Index of 25
selected issues fell 8 percent.
   Throughout the coup attempt, Mrs. Aquino adamantly refused to
compromise with the mutineers, even as rebel planes rocketed the
Malacanang presidential palace.
   ``I promise you that I will continue to serve the Filipino
people, and I will offer every moment of my life, and I shall never
let evil triumph in our country,'' Mrs. Aquino said Sunday during
funeral services for a loyal officer killed in the struggle.
``Those who are guilty will be meted out the full penalties.''
   After each of the five previous coup attempts, Mrs. Aquino made
the same bold, belligerent statements. Action proved weaker than
rhetoric.
   Few participants were ever punished. Those who were sentenced to
prison by military courts remain under house arrest pending review
of their sentences.
   This time, however, the administration may be considering a
firmer response.
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino declared a national state of emergency.
Specific powers made available to the president must be ratified by
Congress.
   But congressional sources say the House of Representatives and
the Senate are prepared to grant her broad, temporary powers to
suspend strikes, conduct searches and seizures without warrants and
take other measures to restore order and prevent another coup.
   The emergency declaration has been widely applauded as a
necessary step and welcome sign of firmness, although some
prominent human rights advocates expressed concern that it could
infringe on personal freedoms.
   Mrs. Aquino also appears ready to confront civilian opposition
politicians long suspected of having prior knowledge of coup
attempts, if not having been part of the financing and planning.
   During a speech Friday to a crowd of more than 100,000, she
singled out Vice President Salvador Laurel, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
and her pro-Marcos cousin, Eduardo Cojuangco, for possible
involvement in the coup attempt.
   But others believe Mrs. Aquino must also come to grips with the
fact that her popularity has been declining in the face of rising
prices, a breakdown in law and order, infrastructure decay and
alleged corruption.
   ``The bottom line here is: Can democracy work in the Third World
country?'' wrote former presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno in
the Philippine Daily Star. ``Can it work in the Philippines with
one of the highest poverty threshholds ... with a population that
has doubled in 30 years ... So far, it hasn't.''
   Those behind the latest coup attempt apparently timed their
attacks in hopes of expoiting public discontent. Most Filipinos
oppose a military-backed government but still believe Mrs. Aquino
has been ineffective in coping with the nation's problems.
   ``It is time to show righteous anger and steely determination,
not only against enemies of the state but also against the sorry
state of the nation,'' wrote columnist Antonio Abaya in The Manila
Chronicle.
   After coup attempts in November 1986 and August 1987, Mrs.
Aquino revamped her Cabinet. Many political commentators believe
she must take the same step this time.
   Respected commentator Luis Beltran wrote in The Manila Standard
that some advisers are urging a such change but others feel the
show of support for Mrs. Aquino at Friday's rally indicate changes
in the Cabinet are not necessary.
   Before the rally, columnist Alvin Capino wrote in the Philippine
Daily Globe that many people wanted to display solidarity with Mrs.
Aquino but that a large crowd ``would give President Aquino the
impression that they are happy with her administration.''
   Government sources complain bitterly about inefficiency in the
presidential palace staff, where rival factions block directives
they don't like.
   Sources familiar with the palace staff, speaking on condition of
anonymnity, also complain that Mrs. Aquino's advisers have isolated
her from the problems of ordinary Filipinos.

<HEAD>Friends Try to Win American's Release From El Salvador</HEAD>

   Friends of an American woman being held in El Salvador have
recorded four songs on her behalf, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson said
he plans to meet with Salvadoran and U.S. officials to help gain
her release.
   Jackson said he hoped to have the meetings concerning
28-year-old Jennifer J. Casolo this week. She is being held on
suspicion of helping leftist insurgents after authorities uncovered
a weapons cache that was buried in the garden of her rented San
Salvador home.
   She has insisted that she knew nothing about the weapons.
   ``Jennifer, you are not alone,'' Jackson told the several
hundred people at an ecumenical service Sunday at St. Joseph's
Cathedral in Hartford, Conn.
   ``We shall seek to meet with the Salvadoran ambassador to this
country. We shall seek to meet with (State Department) personnel in
this country. We shall seek to visit you. We shall seek to bring
you home.''
   There was no answer early today at El Salvador's embassy in
Washington.
   Casolo's father, John, asked the audience to join him in prayer.
   ``I would like you all to bow your heads and pray for the
release of my daughter,'' he said. ``Please send Jennifer home soon
safely to us. ... I know she's doing your work, and I know she's
innocent.''
   The four-song cassette, ``For Jennifer,'' was recorded Saturday
by folk singer Michael Stern. He said he plans to send it Casolo in
the Salvadoran prison.
   The cassette also is being sent to radio stations around the
United States.
   Stern said he met Casolo six years ago at University Baptist
Church in Seattle, where she lived for two years and was active in
the sanctuary movement of harboring illegal aliens fleeing turmoil
in Central America.
   Casolo, of Thomaston, Conn., went to El Salvador in 1985 to work
for Christian Education Seminars, a group dedicated to influencing
U.S. policy by organizing fact-finding tours for Americans.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind as a personal friend of hers that
she is totally innocent,'' said Stern, 36, a nurse at the
University of Washington student health clinic. ``She's a religious
person. She's committed to non-violence.''

<HEAD>Bush Received Secret Report on Soviet Military Cuts in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, who until last month
maintained that Soviet defense spending was growing, received a
classified Pentagon report in May in which U.S. intelligence
analysts expressed the opposite view, a published report says.
   Bush ordered the secret study of U.S. defense strategy shortly
after his election as an aid for dealing with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, The Washington Post reported in today's
editions.
   A 26-page executive summary of the report states that ``there is
broad agreement within the U.S. intelligence community'' that the
Soviet Union under Gorbachev ``has decided to reverse a 20-year
pattern of growth in Soviet military spending and force structure
in order to boost the civil economy and Soviet foreign policy.''
   Until a month ago, Bush and senior advisers criticized what they
said was an increase in Soviet defense spending as they pressed
Congress to approve the nearly $300 billion defense budget for
fiscal 1990.
   Meanwhile, Bush said in interviews released Sunday that he
gained ``more respect'' for Gorbachev at the Malta summit and
thinks he can trust the Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev is ``up against some tremendous problems and is
determined to solve them,'' Bush told Newsweek magazine.
   Asked if his view of Gorbachev had changed, Bush replied,
``There is certainly an element of respect for the way he has
managed the change in Eastern Europe and (his) determination to
fight for perestroika reform at home.
   ``I have more respect for him than I did back when he first came
into office, back when I first met him or when I saw him last
year.''
   Perestroika, the Russian word for restructuring, is shorthand
for the economic changes that Gorbachev is pushing to revive the
ailing Soviet economy.
   ``I think I can trust Gorbachev,'' Bush said in an interview in
Time magazine. ``I looked him in the eye, I appraised him. He was
very determined. Yet there was a twinkle. He is a guy quite sure of
what he is doing. He has got a political feel.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed higher against the yen in Tokyo
Monday, while stock prices also rose.
   The dollar closed at 144.65 yen, up 0.38 yen from its 144.27-yen
close on Friday and slightly higher than its opening of 144.50 yen.
It ranged between 144.45 and 144.73 yen during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues gained 28.61 points, closing at 37,752.67. On
Friday, the index lost 134.05 points after marking new highs on
each of the previous four days.
   In the currency market, the dollar was apparently bolstered by
dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan shortly after the
market opened and by purchases by major trading companies, dealers
said.
   A large number of export contracts usually due for settlement on
Monday tightened demand for the dollar in the morning, dealers
said. The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, does not
comment on its market activities.
   ``There is no particular (market-affecting) news'' this morning,
said Shinzo Yamamoto, a dealer with Daiwa Bank. He indicated,
however, that Tokyo dealers were taking their cue from a
strengthening of the dollar in New York on Friday.
   Trading got off to a slow start on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as
participants waited to see the market's performance after its
strong advances last week, traders said.
   After opening lower, the Nikkei rebounded toward the end of the
morning session on buying of natural resource-oriented shares, they
said.
   Volume was estimated at 380 million shares, down from an
estimated 550 million shares Friday.

   Freddie Roberts could use a few
lessons from Santa.
   Roberts, an inventor in the north-central Tennessee community of
Clarksville, was piloting his gyrocopter-turned-Santa's sleigh on
Saturday when it stalled at an altitude of about 600 feet. He
escaped injury when he made an emergency landing in a tobacco
field, but his aircraft was damaged.
   ``I'm going to have to make new reindeer,'' said Roberts. ``All
the reindeer got annihilated.''
   The modified gyrocopter has a side panel shaped and painted to
appear as Santa in his sleigh, being pulled by his reindeer. At
Halloween, he painted the craft to appear as a witch on a broom.
   ``I'm hoping there is enough time between now and Christmas to
get it back together,'' Roberts said. ``There are going to some
dissappointed kids if they don't see Santa Claus flying.''
   Roberts said he builds and flies the craft because of the
enjoyment it gives children.
   He said he learned a few things from Saturday's accident. For
one, he needs a better tail rudder to make a more airworthy sleigh.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, whose academic
accomplishments in college were less than stellar, says he likes
what Albert Einstein once said about education.
   ``Einstein once defined education as `that which remains when
one has forgotten everything he learned in school.' I confess that
I've always found this definition rather comforting,'' Quayle said.
   ``After all, for some of us, forgetting what we learned in
school isn't all that difficult,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle made his remarks after receiving an honorary Doctor of
Laws degree from Yeshiva University at a dinner in a Manhattan
hotel.

   Local officials have found a way to get
responses to a long survey on the town's rapid growth: a reward.
   Officials in the southern Maine community of 3,500 people are
giving respondents a shot at a $250 lottery. So far, 26 percent of
townspeople have responded _ quite an improvement from another
recent survey to which less than 2 percent responded.
   Raymond is required by state law to adopt a comprehensive growth
plan by 1991. The population of the town in southern Maine has
increased 66 percent since 1980.
   ``At first we thought this was kind of tacky _ like an insult to
have a drawing for money, when out of the goodness of their hearts
and civic duty people should respond,'' said Chairwoman Jackie
Hewitt of the Raymond Planning Committee.
   ``But we knew that in the past this hadn't worked. So we decided
to try a lottery,'' she said.
   Questionnaires, with lottery tickets stapled on, were sent out
in November. Residents have until January to respond.
   Committee members chose the $250 figure because they figured it
would be large enough to attract attention, ``but small enough to
not lead to lying and cheating and stealing,'' said Town Manager
Martin Krauter.
   Some want more money.
   ``I'd say $250 doesn't do much for people these days,'' said Jim
Phoenix, owner of Tommy's Sandwich Shop. ``If they'd have made it
$1,000, they'd have gotten a lot more responses.''

<HEAD>5 Weeks After Racial Incident, MacMurray College has Quieted Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH OKESON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five weeks after racist letters were
sent to black students at MacMurray College, the incident has
prompted race-awareness activities and, some say, a new climate on
the campus.
   ``Before the letters, there was a lot of tension, but now it's
suppressed, and everybody's making an effort,'' said Kevin Ray, a
black freshman at the small liberal-arts school.
   ``I think before the letters MacMurray was to some extent a
closed community with the blacks on the outside looking in,'' said
Ricky Bragg, a black sophomore. ``Since the letters, I've noticed a
lot more interaction between blacks and whites.''
   On Nov. 2, letters containing racial slurs and threats were
found in campus mailboxes of the 35 to 40 black students at the
620-student school, as well as that of the college's only black
staff member.
   The letters were addressed to students by name and campus mail
box number. They contained epithets such as ``Uncle Tom'' and slurs
specifically tailored to each recipient, according to students who
saw the letters.
   Four days later, students marched in protest across the campus
of the private college in west-central Illinois.
   Jacksonville Police Chief Tom Weeks says his department hasn't
identified a suspect, although police were able to take
fingerprints from the letters.
   ``It's pretty much a dead issue right now,'' Weeks said.
   Student body president Michelle Sharp holds little hope that the
culprit will be found.
   ``I don't think we'll ever know who wrote the letters,'' said
Ms. Sharp, a junior majoring in education for the deaf. ``I don't
think it would be possible to fingerprint everyone on campus.''
   Ms. Sharp, who is white, said it may be best that the writer
remain unknown.
   ``If it's a white student, it's going to cause a lot of tension
between blacks and whites,'' she said. ``If it's a black student,
the blacks will be embarrassed. I think many students would feel
better not knowing.''
   Since the letter-writing, there haven't been any racial
incidents reported on campus. The college has sponsored a forum for
students to talk about racism, and seminars on cultural diversity
and a workshop on racism are in the works. Officials say more
classes may include subjects of black interest.
   The student government is planning an ethnic festival and the
sale of T-shirts promoting racial equality, and the administration
plans to make Martin Luther King's birthday a holiday.
   College president Edward Mitchell said he wants to recruit more
black faculty members but that it's difficult because blacks who
receive doctoral degrees are intensely sought by other colleges.
   ``It's just very difficult because of the small number in the
pipeline and because in a school of this size and in a town this
size there's just not the support network of other professional
minorities,'' Mitchell said.
   ``Our best hope to recruit additional role models is going to be
from our own students, and that's going to take a while.''
   Philosophy professor Richard Palmer said the incident gave a
false picture of MacMurray, which he said has traditionally
welcomed black students.
   Black senior Marquita Archie, who said she cried each day for
five days after the incident, said the letters reflected the bias
that is everywhere.
   Ms. Sharp, the student body president, said the students now
realize that.
   ``I think it affected the majority of the students on campus and
opened a lot of students' eyes about racial tension,'' she said.
``I know it opened mine.''

   A women's basketball player who tutors
Cambodian refugees and a woman who worked in a Brazilian orphanage
were among 32 Americans to join the ranks of Rhodes Scholars.
   The 18 men and 14 women selected Sunday receive two years of
study at Oxford University in England.
   Yale and Princeton universities led with four each, Harvard had
three, and Georgetown, Kansas State University and the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., each had two.
   The winners were chosen from among 102 finalists interviewed
last week by the Rhodes Scholarship Trust, whose American branch is
based at Pomona College in suburban Claremont.
   ``It was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences I've had,''
said Yale's Michael Warren, a history major from Blacksburg, Va.,
who plans to study modern liberal political philosophy.
   Other winners were Bridget Clarke, a philosophy major at the
University of Montana who has worked in shelters for battered women
and the homeless in Missoula; and Suzanne Lee Corley, who majors in
religion, Spanish and French at Presbyterian College in Clinton,
S.C., and worked in the orphanage in Brazil.
   Ms. Corley, 21, said her family was ``incredulous'' upon hearing
of the honor. ``I've applied for so many other scholarships and
haven't gotten them,'' she said.
   Andrew John Dechet of Vancouver, Wash., who studied flamenco
guitar in Spain with Gypsies, is a Germanic language and literature
major at Princeton.
   ``I've sort of recovered from the shock by now,'' he said.
   Dechet said he has been to England once before _ on a plane
layover just long enough to get ``sick on the fish and chips.''
   ``I'm trying to contain it as much as possible,'' said Paul W.
Muench, Jr., a 22-year-old psychology and philosophy major at Reed
College in Portland, Ore. ``When I found out, I was really
dumbfounded and very excited about the whole thing. I'm still kind
of in a state of disbelief.''
   Amy Deane Matthews, an English major and member of Mount Holyoke
College's varsity basketball and crew teams, tutors Cambodian
refugees. Rhodes officials said she has a perfect academic record.
   West Point's recipients are women. Jennie Koch, of Potomac, Md.,
ranks fifth in her class as an international relations major, and
is considering a career in public service with an emphasis on
foreign policy.
   Carolyn A. Ford of Pensacola, Fla., who was appointed to the
academy through the enlisted ranks, is a specialist in Chinese. She
also is a brigade swimming champion, a graduate of the Airborne
School, and a battalion commander. She plans a career in military
intelligence.
   Rhodes Scholars were chosen from 17 other countries.
   Winners must be unmarried and between ages 18 and 24.
Recipients' school fees are paid and they receive a stipend for
expenses.
   Among the qualities sought are proven intellectual and academic
excellence, integrity, respect for others, and the ability to lead
and to use talents fully.
   Athletic prowess also is sought as ``an indicator of the stamina
a person must have to act energetically as a leader and to work for
other people,'' said David Alexander, American secretary of the
trust and Pomona president.
   Rhodes scholarships were established in 1902 by the estate of
Cecil Rhodes, the British philanthropist and colonialist. Rhodes
had hoped the scholarships would contribute to world understanding
and peace. Women have been eligible since 1976.
   The scholarships have gone to 2,564 Americans, including Sen.
Bill Bradley, D-N.J., entertainer Kris Kristofferson, former Los
Angeles Rams quarterback Pat Haden and U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Byron White.

   Thousands of abortion-rights and AIDS activists
converged on St. Patrick's Cathedral, forcing Cardinal John J.
O'Connor to temporarily halt Mass as police carried out dozens of
protesters on stretchers.
   More than 100 people were arrested and three police officers
sustained minor injuries, authorities said.
   Inside, where 43 were arrested, demonstrators chained themselves
to pews and lay in the center aisle.
   Outside, about 4,500 people marched along Fifth Avenue, with
some holding signs such as ``Curb Your Dogma'' and ``Pope John Paul
for Ayatollah.'' Others chanted ``Teach safe sex,'' and ``Just say
no is not enough.''
   O'Connor asked the congregation Sunday to stand and join him in
reciting prayers. He was forced to skip his sermon, handing out
copies instead.
   Then, as dozens of police hauled protesters away on bright
orange stretchers, O'Connor resumed the Mass.
   Gay activists have staged several demonstrations at St.
Patrick's since 1987, when O'Connor barred a homosexual Roman
Catholic group, Dignity, from using church buildings.
   Those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and
trespassing, said Sgt. Peter Sweeney, a police spokesman.
   The protest was organized by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power
(ACT UP) and Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!).
   ``We demand to bring our issues to the cardinal directly and
that's what we did,'' said organizer Victor Mendolia.
   A statement by the groups said they ``do not challenge anyone's
right to worship as they choose.'' However, they criticized
O'Connor for his opposition to abortion and his vocal support of
Operation Rescue, which has blockaded abortion clinics; for
lobbying against education about safer sex and condoms, especially
in schools; and for his opposition to gay rights legislation.
   ``They are not moral issues. They are political issues,''
Mendolia said. ``Their religious bullying infringes on the personal
liberties of all Americans.''
   Church officials, anticipating the well-publicized
demonstration, cleared the church after the 9 a.m. Mass, then
searched the bags of everyone coming in for the 10:15 a.m. Mass.
   The cathedral doors were locked a few minutes after Mass
started, said Joe Zwilling, an archdiocese spokesman. Police were
stationed throughout the massive cathedral, even at the altar rail.
   After the Mass, O'Connor said the protest left him anguished.
   ``The archbishop of New York must of course always preach what
the church preaches, teach what the church teaches,'' O'Connor
said. ``I cannot believe that anyone, even those who hate what the
church teaches, would respect me for a moment if I taught anything
else.''
   The congregation applauded enthusiastically.
   O'Connor later said he was particularly upset that one person
who stood in line for Holy Communion broke the wafer and threw it
on the floor.
   Among those inside was Mayor Edward I. Koch, who is Jewish and
has differed with O'Connor on the issues that sparked the protest
but showed up ``to defend the cathedral.''
   ``You don't have a right to disrupt a church service,'' Koch
said. ``That's the law.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle wants the Soviet Union
to work to repeal a 1975 United Nations resolution that equated
Zionism with racism.
   Quayle also said he planned to tell U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar today that the United States wants the
resolution repealed.
   He said he planned to present Perez de Cuellar with a $65
million check for U.S. obligations to the world body.
   On Sunday, Quayle said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev should
show that he wants the United Nations to play a bigger role in
world affairs by helping sponsor a new resolution.
   ``This resolution would state that Zionism is not and never had
been a form of racism. Furthermore, we would declare once and for
all the Zionism-is-racism resolution null and void,'' Quayle told a
Yeshiva University audience at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he
received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.
   Quayle praised the Soviet Union's ``new thinking'' in moving
away from its anti-Israel propaganda.
   But the Soviet Union, which was instrumental in passing the 1975
resolution, can do more by helping ``gain repeal of this loathsome
provision,'' Quayle said.
   Zionism is the ideology on which Israel is based.

   A man accused of torturing and killing at
least 77 cats is out of jail, but a judge ordered him to find a
job, begin intense psychotherapy, and spend his nights at home
while awaiting trial.
   Mitchell M. Munoz, a 34-year-old unemployed Emory Law School
graduate, was released Friday after Judge Wayne Purdom reduced his
bond from $75,000 to $25,000 while imposing the restrictions.
   Munoz was arrested in October after a photo processor notified
police that film dropped off by Munoz showed cats that had been
tortured.
   At a hearing Friday, prosecutors said Munoz is dangerous and
should be hospitalized. But Purdom sided with Munoz' attorney that
the bond be reduced.
   If convicted of the 77 counts of cruelty to animals, Munoz could
be sentenced to 77 years in prison and fined $77,000.
   No trial date has been set.

   A disbarred lawyer just out of
jail becomes deputy premier with partial responsibility for police.
   A dissident journalist who also has done time, and most recently
stoked coal in a factory, is named foreign minister.
   A bank clerk takes over the Finance Ministry.
   The appointments Sunday show just how utterly a 3-week-old
peaceful popular revolt has turned Czechoslovak politics on end.
   The swift, smooth revolution has ousted the leaders of the
crackdown that followed the suppression of the 1968 `Prague Spring'
reforms. Out are those who stripped of party membership half a
million Communists deemed too reformist.
   Many of the persecuted also lost all access to anything but the
most menial jobs. Now, those who suffered are returning with
remarkable ease to take center stage in national politics.
   The revolt has brought the ebullient Jiri Dienstbier, working as
a stoker since he last got out of jail in 1982, back to his
original profession, journalism _ a job he lost in the crackdown on
``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   The only difference is that instead of writing stories,
Dienstbier gave them out, as spokesman for the Civic Forum
opposition coalition.
   Now, he is to serve as foreign minister, a role Civic Forum
thinks he is suited for because of his fluent English and French
and experience in the Far East and the United States in the
mid-1960s as a correspondent for state radio.
   After he lost that job and his Communist Party membership,
Dienstbier worked in the archive department of a design institute
and wrote three books published in the West but banned in
Czechoslovakia.
   Once he signed the Charter 77 human rights document in 1977 and
became a leading member of VONS, a movement keeping track of
political prisoners, Dienstbier found himself increasingly under
police harassment.
   In May 1979, the police arrested Dienstbier, Vaclav Havel and
other leading VONS activists. In November that year Dienstbier was
sentenced to three years in jail. Since release, he had worked as a
stoker, swapping shifts in a Prague factory with another dissident,
Petr Uhl.
   A far more recent ex-prisoner now in the government is Jan
Carnogursky, a dissident barred from practicing law since 1977 and
a well-known Roman Catholic activist in his native Slovakia.
   Carnogursky was released from jail only two weeks ago, one of
the first political prisoners to be freed as the Communists
scrambled to meet the demands of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Carnogursky, 45, was arrested in mid-August along with four
other dissidents for signing an appeal to Slovaks to lay flowers in
memory of those who died in the August 1968 Soviet-led invasion
that crushed the `Prague Spring' reforms.
   Authorities charged Carnogursky and Miroslav Kusy, another
Slovak dissident named Sunday as head of a new federal office of
press and information, with incitement and subversion charges that
could have jailed them for up to 10 years.
   Kusy was released before his trial and acquittal last month, but
Carnogursky was not allowed out.
   A bespectacled, balding man with polite, careful manners,
Carnogursky won a reputation in Bratislava as a defense lawyer or
legal adviser on human rights cases, and the publisher of the
underground newspaper, Bratislavske Listy.
   On Sunday, he was named one of two first deputy premiers in the
new government.
   Vaclav Klaus, the new finance minister, also suffered for his
beliefs.
   He was expelled from the country's leading institute of economic
research at the age of 26 in 1970 and worked in lowly positions at
the state bank through the 1970s.
   Klaus's free market economic beliefs may not go down well with
Czechoslovak workers, who have enjoyed a relatively cozy life for
relatively little work for the past four decades.
   It will be up to Petr Miller, a worker at Prague's giant CKD
heavy engineering works, to safeguard the proletarian interests as
Labor Minister.
   Miller, 48, is a blacksmith by profession. He started work at
CKD in 1962, and enrolled to study economics in 1969, but was
thrown out the next year during the crackdown.

<HEAD>Contract Offers Booed by Boeing Engineers, Technicians</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A walkout by Boeing Co. scientists, engineers and
technicians remains a longshot, but they may reject contract offers
that are smaller than production workers won in a 48-day strike,
union leaders say.
   Boos and sardonic laughter punctuated a meeting of more than
2,000 of the 17,600-member Seattle Professional Engineering
Employees Association, Boeing's second-largest union.
   The union has never struck and lacks a strike fund. But many
members carried signs and some distributed leaflets calling for
contract rejection and a walkout at the world's largest commercial
jet builder.
   Also Sunday, a contract similar to one accepted by the
Machinists union was ratified by United Aerospace Workers Local
1069. The pact covers about 3,000 workers at Boeing Helicopters at
Ridley Township, Pa., near Philadelphia, and is retroactive to Oct.
5.
   The Machinists' settlement, which followed the longest strike
against Boeing in 41 years, provided ``the economic guidelines that
we could follow,'' said Robert Torgerson of Boeing Helicopters.
   At the Seattle Center Coliseum, hooting was loudest when union
president Charles Bofferding emphasized that negotiators hadn't
made a recommendation.
   ``Take a stand!'' several people shouted.
   Ballots were mailed to members' homes Friday, along with 30-page
booklets listing all changes from the three-year pacts that expired
Dec. 1 but were extended indefinitely as talks continued. The vote
count is set for Dec. 18.
   One three-year offer covers 15,000 scientists and engineers. The
other is for 12,800 technical support workers, with almost all
members of both units in the Puget Sound area.
   Engineers and scientists, who earn an average of nearly $40,000
a year, would get a 4 percent wage increase and a productivity
bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year but no further
increases.
   Technicians, with average pay of about $28,000, would get annual
increases of 3 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent and bonuses of 10
percent, 5 percent and 4 percent.
   The three-year contract for Boeing's Machinists included annual
wage increases of 4, 3 and 3 percent; bonuses of 10, 5 and 4
percent of gross pay and an improvement in the cost-of-living
formula from about 83 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent.
   The outcome of the voting is anyone's guess, Bofferding said
after the meeting.
   ``I believe, though, the general response of our people to the
wage proposal is fairly negative,'' he added.
   ``There's a reasonably good chance that the members would not
accept the contract, based on the mood tonight,'' said negotiator
Richard Van Guilder of the technicians' unit.
   Chief corporate spokesman Harold Carr said it was unfair to
compare the Machinists' contract, which covers 57,800 workers, to
offers to the engineers and technicians was unfair.
   ``The problem is when you try to compare a professional to a guy
sweeping the factory floor. That is not legitimate,'' Carr said.

   An international ski and dog sled team
trekking across Antarctica is expected to reach the South Pole this
week, according to an expedition spokeswoman.
   ``They are about 50 miles from the pole right now, and they have
been averaging 25 miles per day,'' the spokeswoman, Jennifer
Kimball Gasperini, said Sunday. They could reach the pole tonight
or Tuesday, she said.
   The St. Paul-based International Trans-Antarctica Expedition
already has traveled more than 1,900 miles since leaving the
northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula on July 27.
   The men and dogs trudged the length of the treacherous peninsula
in winter, never tried before.
   The group's co-leader, Will Steger of Minnesota, made history
three years ago when he led a similar assault on the North Pole.
   ABC-TV scuttled plans to broadcast live from the South Pole, but
hopes to rush out fresh video for the third of its five prime-time
specials on the expedition, to be aired next Sunday.
   For all the fanfare, the South Pole is little more than a
milepost. The goal is to reach Mirnyy, a Soviet science station on
the continent's Indian Ocean shore. That's another 1,600 miles and
three months to complete the $11 million, seven-month journey.
   ``I say Mirnyy or die,'' Steger said earlier.
   The expedition's other members are co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne
of France, Victor Boyarsky from the Soviet Union, Geoff Somers from
Great Britain, Keizo Funatsu from Japan and Qin Dahe from China.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Cosby, America's favorite television
father and author of the book ``Fatherhood,'' says he's estranged
from his real-life daughter Erinn, whom he calls irresponsible and
untrustworthy.
   ``She's 23 now. She's never held down a job, never kept an
apartment for more than six months. She uses her boyfriends. She
wants the finer things but she can't stand anybody else's dirt,''
Cosby said in an interview published in Sunday's Los Angeles Times.
   ``The problem isn't alcohol or drugs _ at the rehab center her
urine showed up negative. It's behavioral. She's very stubborn.''
   Miss Cosby checked out of a drug rehabilitation center in
September after acknowledging cocaine, marijuana and alcohol abuse.
   ``Looking back, I can't believe how dad managed to go on with
his show every week, portraying America's favorite father, while
having a daughter like me causing so much pain,'' she was quoted as
saying in the National Enquirer's Oct. 10th edition.
   Her dad, whose best seller ``Fatherhood'' is about raising his
five children, has said that ``tough love'' _ letting Erinn work it
out on her own _ was the only way to allow her to deal with her
problems.
   ``It's going to take her hitting rock bottom, where she's
totally exhausted and at that point where she can't fight anymore.
Right now we're estranged. She can't come here. She's not a person
you can trust,'' Cosby said.
   ``You think you're not a good parent because you don't answer
the call. But you can't let the kid use you.''

<HEAD>China Says Scowcroft Visit Will Help Improve Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's official media today heralded the visit
of National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and quoted Deng
Xiaoping and other leaders as saying the time had come to restore
good relations with the United States.
   The surprise one-day visit by over the weekend effectively ended
a U.S. ban on high-level exchanges imposed after Beijing
authorities sent in the military to crush the pro-democracy
movement in June.
   Both sides expressed their hopes for a truce in recent
U.S.-Chinese feuding, with Deng saying good relations are crucial
for world peace and security. However, no concrete measures to ease
frictions between the two sides were announced.
   The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily today
carried two lengthy front-page stories on Scowcroft's meetings with
Chinese leaders, including three separate pictures of the American
emissary with Deng, Premier Li Peng, and party chief Jiang Zemin.
   ``Deng Xiaoping Says Sino-U.S. Relations Should Finally
Improve,'' one headline said.
   It noted that Jiang spoke of the ``broad prospects'' for
cooperation and Li said both countries should ``do more practical
work'' to improve relations.
   Li's remarks were at variance with previous Chinese statements
that the United States was entirely at fault for strained ties and
must take the initiative in normalizing relations.
   However, a U.S. official said it ``remains to be seen'' whether
the good intentions expressed by both sides will result in any
substantive progress in resolving conflicts.
   Those include U.S. concerns over China's human rights record and
the issue of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, the pro-democracy dissident
who has been hiding in the U.S. Embassy with his wife, Li Shuxian,
since June and who is wanted by Chinese police as a
``counterrevolutionary.''
   There is also speculation that Beijing will retaliate against
U.S. measures to extend the visas of Chinese students in the United
States by halting widely popular student exchange programs.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III defended
President Bush's decision to send the delegation six months after
China began its crackdown by driving protesters from Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
   Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military attack.
   Speaking on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' program,
Baker said, ``The president ... deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen
Square. But he's of the view that we shouldn't run the risk of
compounding that tragedy by trying to isolate China from the
international community.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, was among congressional critics of the trip.
He said: ``At the very time that freedom is sweeping through
Eastern Europe, we should be sure the United States stands for
freedom and democracy in Asia as well.''
   Bush suspended high-level exchanges and military-related sales
and contacts after troops fought their way into Beijing on June 4,
driving pro-democracy protesters out of the city center.
   He also joined other Western leaders in supporting cancellation
of talks on new development loans to China.
   Scowcroft, accompanied by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger, also briefed the Chinese on the Malta summit and other
international issues before leaving Sunday for Tokyo, where they
briefed Chinese leaders on the visit. He was to return to
Washington today.

<HEAD>Gov't Devalues Currency By More Than Half, Raises Fuel Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to cool an
overheated economy, the government has cut the value of the
currency by more than half and ordered sharp fuel price increases.
   The Economy Ministry, in a communique issued minutes before
midnight Sunday, said it was making ``corrections'' in the economic
policy followed by the government of President Carlos Menen since
his July 8 inauguration.
   All banks and currency exchange houses were ordered closed today
so the economic adjustments could be made more smoothly.
   The corrections were required, the ministry said, ``to combat
disturbances experienced in the exchange market in recent weeks.''
   The Ministry said it would devalue the austral by 53.4 percent _
setting the official value of the national currency at 1,000 to one
U.S. dollar, compared to the 650-1 official rate in effect since
July 10.
   The official exchange market will be used for sale and purchase
of dollars in export-import and financial operations, the ministry
said.
   At the same time, the ministry said, it will permit the
operation of a ``free'' exchange market for all other dollar
transactions on which the value of the austral will be allowed to
float.
   An illegal although widely tolerated black market previously had
operated in Argentina and a widening gap between the official and
black market values of the dollar had provoked concern in recent
weeks.
   On Thursday, the dollar sold for 1,020 australs on the black
market, compared to the official value of 655.
   The ministry also announced that the price of regular gasoline
would rise by 61 percent to the equivalent of $1.44 per gallon.
   Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli said new rates for public
utilities, such as telephones, natural gas and electricity, would
be announced today.
   Current public service rates were set July 9 when they were
increased by 200 percent, and were to have remained frozen for all
of 1990.
   The communique, issued after Menem met for three hours with his
Cabinet, also announced a $30 monthly pay increase for public
employes and a $24 raise for the private sector.
   The communique said the Treasury will cease to provide aid in
financing deficits of state companies and provincial governments.
   The government has moved cautiously on the issue of modifying
current economic policy. A devaluation was considered likely to
fuel price increases, wage demands and inflation. Also, higher
utility bills and transport fares might erode public support for
the 5-month-old government.
   The cost of living, which soared to nearly 200 percent in July,
had dropped by 5.6 percent in October, but rose by 6.5 percent in
November. Independent economists predicted the December rate could
be in double digits.

<TEXT>
   In a move that could further delay the first
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Israel is asking stronger U.S.
assurances the PLO will not be involved, officials said today.
   Israeli wants the new assurances before Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens agrees to attend a preliminary meeting in Washington expected
to work out a Palestinian delegation to the first direct talks with
Israeli representatives, officials said.
   In the occupied lands, meanwhile, soldiers today shot and
wounded seven Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwing youths,
Arab reports said.
   The confrontations were touched off by the fatal shootings of
two Palestinians Sunday, apparently by Israeli civilians who opened
fire after attacks on their vehicles by stone-throwers, Israeli and
Arab reports said.
   A total of 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the 2-year-old uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. At least 155 other Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis also have died.
   The army also said troops on Sunday night demolished the homes
of three suspects in the slaying of an alleged Palestinian
collaborator with Israel.
   In comments on army radio, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said he
still was suspicious that Egypt was indirectly representing the
Palestine Liberation Organization. ``If this is what will be, I
fear that we won't get very far,'' Arens said.
   Arens had planned a trip to Washington next month for a meeting
with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Egypt's foreign
minister, Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
   Asked about the Washington trip today, Arens said, ``Firstly,
I'm not going yet. We will first conduct contacts concerning the
guarantees that our Cabinet has asked.''
   Avi Pazner, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, said
Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein would go to Washington later
this week to discuss the promise sought by Israel.
   Israel had asked U.S. guarantees against any PLO role last month
in its acceptance of Baker's proposal for the Washington meeting.
   The latest possible obstacle to talks followed weekend news
reports that secret contacts already were under way among Israeli,
Egyptian, American and Palestinian officials to draw up a list of
Palestinian negotiators.
   A PLO spokesman in Cairo, Said Kamal, was quoted in the Yediot
Ahronot daily today as saying the organization had been asked to
draw up three lists of names for presentation to the Israelis.
   On Sunday, the newspaper listed some of the Palestinians under
consideration as east Jerusalem activist Faisal Husseini,
journalist and union leader Radwan Abu Ayyash, newspaper editor
Hannah Siniora, and Assad Saftawi, a school principle in Gaza City.
   Saftawi confirmed the reported behind-the-scenes contacts to The
Associated Press and said he was heading to Cairo for talks on the
subject.
   But Pazner denied the report, saying the contacts had not
reached the stage of putting together a list of negotiators.

   Palestinians should be able to choose their
own representatives at U.S.-backed talks between Israel and
Palestinians on the Middle East peace process, says PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat.
   Israel has said it will refuse to negotiate with anyone
connected with Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, which
the Israelis consider a terrorist group.
   The PLO has criticized the U.S.-backed plan for a dialogue in
Cairo that could lead to elections in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Asked about Israel's refusal to negotiate with the PLO, Arafat
said, ``With whom they are going to make peace? With ghosts?''
   Arafat was speaking by satellite from Baghdad, Iraq, on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press,'' which was taped Saturday and aired Sunday.
   Asked if he could assure Israel that a Palestinian state would
pose no threat to the Jewish state, Arafat replied, ``We want to
live in peace with all our neighbors, including the Israelis.''
   ``We are looking for a brave man, a brave leader among the
Israeli leadership, to accept, to start the peace processes, to
implement real peace in the land of peace,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that if a Palestinian state were created, it
would seek to confederate with Jordan.
   ``The Palestinians and their leadership have the right to
designate their representatives, as well as the Israeli government
will designate their delegation,'' he said.
   ``If they want the PLO to participate in this negotiation,
definitely, we have the right,'' the PLO chairman said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in May proposed that
elections be held in the occupied territories to allow Palestinians
to choose their own representatives under a plan for limited
self-rule. Shamir ruled out Israeli withdrawal or recognition of a
Palestinian state.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed a 10-point
modification of Shamir's plan under which Israel would accept the
idea of trading land for peace. He later called for hold direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III then formulated his
own five-point plan to advance the negotiations, which both Israel
and Egypt agreed to with reservations.

<HEAD>Communists Expected To Lose in Local Elections in Baltics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Estonians and Latvians took part in the first
major contested local elections in the Soviet Union, and Communists
were expected to lose many of the city and regional council seats
in the Baltic republics.
   Latvian officials said first results would not be released until
Wednesday, and an election official in Estonia said results there
might be available Friday, while Latvians said it would be
Wednesday or later before they had results.
   There were 33,500 candidates running for the councils. Sunday's
elections were critical for local reforms because it is the vast
numbers of local and regional bureaucrats who are blamed for
blocking Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's programs.
   The Baltic elections are the Soviet Union's first major
contested elections at the local level. Other republics will have
their local elections later.
   Polls indicated environmentalists were likely to garner half the
vote in Estonia.
   Estonia's Department of Public Opinion and Market Research did a
pre-election poll showing the Communists would receive less than 10
percent of the vote with 100 percent turnout.
   However, they could fare even worse, since many ethnic Russians
are boycotting the elections to protest a two-year residency
requirement for candidates.
   In Latvia, Communist candidates want to see Latvia gain autonomy
but remain in a reformed Soviet federation, while the grass-roots
Popular Front movement stands for outright independence and
secession, according to the official Soviet news agency Tass.
   The Popular Front in Latvia will be thrilled if it wins half the
races, because Latvians are little more than 30 percent of the
population, said Janis Krumins, deputy editor of Atmoda, the
Popular Front newspaper. Hundreds of thousands of Russians and
other non-Latvians have moved into the republic in the nearly 50
years of Soviet power, and they are divided on the independence
issue.
   The elections are the first in the Soviet Union to include
candidates from de facto alternative political parties, including
environmentalists, a group of farmers seeking the right to own land
and an organization protecting the rights of immigrants.
   Political parties other than the Communists have been legalized
only in the neighboring Baltic republic of Lithuania _ and only
last week.
   A new national Parliament was chosen in the nation's first
contested elections in the spring, but 80 percent of the candidates
were Communist Party members and the rest were independent.

   The infant who received the nation's first
living-donor liver transplant underwent an operation to stop
bleeding on the surface of the liver, a condition doctors called
common and controllable.
   Alyssa Smith was in critical but stable condition today at the
University of Chicago Medical Center, after the second operation in
two days to stop bleeding on the surface of her new organ, which
she received two weeks ago.
   ``The surgeon said the liver looked fine,'' said John Easton, a
spokesman for the medical center.
   Alyssa, 22 months, was in surgery for about four hours Sunday.
   The bleeding was controlled, said Dr. Christoph Broelsch, who
led the transplant and the later operations.
   Doctors first detected the bleeding Saturday afternoon when they
noticed the child's abdomen had swelled, said hospital spokeswoman
Mary Fetsch.
   She called the problem a minor setback.
   ``It's a common problem'' that happens in 30 percent of all
liver-transplant patients, Ms. Fetsch said. ``You just never know
when it's going to happen, but it's something that's controllable
and something you can manage.''
   The problem is the same one that prompted doctors to operate on
Alyssa within 12 hours after she received part of her mother's
liver on Nov. 27.
   The girl is the daughter of John L. and Teresa Smith of Schertz,
Texas, near San Antonio.
   The 29-year-old mother was released from the hospital Thursday,
and has been back to visit several times, Ms. Fetsch said.
   Meanwhile, doctors were optimistic that 15-month-old Sarina
Jones, the nation's second living-donor liver tranplant recipient,
would recover from her 7{-hour surgery performed Friday.
   ``She's doing better than expected,'' Ms. Fetsch said. ``Her
liver functions look good so far and she's very alert.''
   Sarina was expected to remain in critical but stable condition
for the next few days as doctors watch for signs of rejection of
the new organ or the bacterial infection that delayed the surgery,
doctors said. Her condition was unchanged this morning.
   Robert Jones, 20, from the Memphis, Tenn., area, donated the
left lobe of his liver to his daughter. He was moved out of the
intensive care unit Sunday morning and was listed in serious but
stable condition, Ms. Fetsch said.

   Authorities in the southern steel town of
Nowa Huta have quietly removed a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin that
youthful demonstrators have repeatedly defaced and tried to destroy.
   The removal was ordered Friday after demonstrations the past two
Wednesdays in which youths who threw paint and flammable liquids on
the monument clashed with police, who used water cannon and tear
gas to disperse them.
   The state PAP news agency said the 30-foot statue was emoved
from its plinth and ``in perfect condition transported to the
locality of Wroblowice ... For necessary conservation works.''
   Its future will be be decided by the municipal and district
councils, PAP said, but it is unlikely that anyone in Nowa Huta
will want it back.
   The monument to the founder of the Soviet state, placed on a
central square, had been the centerpiece of the city built around a
huge steel mill outside Krakow in the 1950s as a model socialist
community.
   For residents of Nowa Huta, a Solidarity stronghold, it has long
been a despised symbol of Poland's past forced dependence on the
Soviet Union.
   The attacks by the youthful demonstrators had created a delicate
problem for the non-Communist government of Prime Minister Taduesz
Mazowiecki.
   The Solidarity-led government is trying to maintain good
relations with the Soviet Union and said it would not tolerate more
violence. Mediators had called on the local government to move
quickly to remove the monument.
   The statue has suffered several ignoble attacks over the years.
In 1979 it was dynamited by activists and had to be rebuilt by
Communist authorities.
   A spokesman for Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski said the
``acts of vandalism ... met with his highest condemnation.''
   ``He believes these acts are manifestations of exceptional
rampant fury. They do harm to the good name of Poland worldwide,
not only to the good relations with the Soviet Union,'' said the
spokesman, Wlodzimierz Losinski.
   The cultural commission of the Krakow city council on Saturday
also closed the city's Lenin Museum and another cultural
institution bearing his name, the pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper reported today.

<TEXT>
   An alleged key member of the Medellin cocaine
cartel was extradited from Uruguay to the United States despite
escalating anti-extradition terrorism, the FBI has revealed.
   Uruguayan national police turned Raul Silvio Vivas over to FBI
agents at a naval base under heavy guard Friday and he was flown to
California that night, said Thomas R. Parker, assistant agent in
charge of criminal investigations and organized crime activities in
Los Angeles.
   ``He's very close to the top,'' said FBI spokesman Fred Reagan.
   The FBI said Vivas, an Argentine, was under tight security but
refused to disclose his location more specifically than the Los
Angeles metropolitan area. Vivas was scheduled to appear before a
U.S. magistrate in Los Angeles today.
   Vivas, 39, accused of laundering more than $1 billion for the
Colombian cartel and a target of a U.S. Department of Justice
money-laundering probe code-named ``Polar Cap,'' had been held in
an Uruguayan jail since February.
   His extradition, however, occurred just two days after a
devastating terrorist bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers killed
dozens and wounded hundreds outside Colombia's police intelligence
headquarters.
   A group of drug lords calling themselves ``the extraditables''
has been waging a terror campaign of bombings and assassinations to
force the government to end its war on the cartel and forestall
extraditions.
   Parker said Vivas was a ``badly wanted'' fugitive and his
extradition ``marks yet another turning point in the willingness of
the international community, particularly in South America, to work
with us in bringing to an end the tyranny and impunity of these
drug empires.''
   The U.S. indictment of Vivas and 30 others was handed up in
February.
   It charged them with ``carrying out the largest Colombian drug
cartel money laundering operation ever uncovered by American law
enforcement authorities,'' Parker said. Vivas is accused of
personally controlling the flow of more than $1 billion in drug
money, he said.
   Vivas has said he is a legal trader in gold. Uruguay, with some
of the most liberal banking laws in South America, allows both
citizens and foreigners to enter and leave the country with gold
and freely transfer capital in and out.
   Vivas' transfer to FBI custody was conducted under a blanket of
police protection in Uruguay on Friday.
   He was led handcuffed from a jail cell in Maldonado, 90 miles
east of Montevideo, local radio stations reported.
   Police sharpshooters stood guard atop buildings while Vivas was
put in a helicopter for a short ride to the Captain Curbelo navy
base. Access to the base was blocked off and its perimeter was
patrolled by other helicopters. A dozen FBI agents took custody of
Vivas on board a U.S. plane.

   From People magazine with love,
soon-to-be-sexagenarian Sean Connery is the ``Sexiest Man Alive,
1989.''
   ``For once, I'm speechless,'' Connery said after being informed
of the honor. ``It'll all be downhill from here.''
   He joins the ranks of John F. Kennedy Jr., 1988; Harry Hamlin,
1987; Mark Harmon, 1986; and Mel Gibson, 1985.
   ``He was sexy at 26, and at 60 even more so,'' actress Shelley
Winters said of Connery, whom she dated during the 1950s.
   ``He makes a woman feel sexual chemistry. To be his leading
lady, I'd lose 50 pounds and get my face lifted. As a matter of
fact, I'd get everything lifted.''
   Connery's movie roles include James Bond. More recently, he
starred in ``The Untouchables,'' for which he won an Oscar, and in
the new movie ``Family Business.''
   Connery was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Aug. 25, 1930.

<TEXT>
   Few Soviets walked off the job today despite a
call by human rights activist Andrei Sakharov for a two-hour
general strike to demand an end to Communist Party domination,
according to reports reaching Moscow.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, also facing pressure from
hard-line Communists, angrily offered to resign as party leader
after criticism of his overtures to the West, said a member of the
party's policy-making Central Committee who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Sakharov and several other parliamentarians on Sunday urged the
national strike to pressure the Congress of People's Deputies to
vote on rescinding Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which
guarantees the Communists the ``leading and guiding role'' in
society. They also want the Congress, which opens Tuesday, to act
on several key reform laws.
   Sakharov's group failed to win the support of 400 progressive
parliamentarians. The InterRegional Group voted Sunday to favor the
goal of rescinding Communist supremacy but did not back the strike.
Members said the public mood was too explosive.
   Strikes have ravaged the struggling Soviet economy since last
summer. Consumers are angry over shortages of food and consumer
goods, and officials now warn that city-supplied steam heat could
be affected by a coal strike in the depths of an already bitter
Russian winter.
   On the streets of the capital today it was business as usual.
Stores and transport operated and no pickets were in evidence.
   However, 214 of the 500 researchers at the Academy of Sciences'
geography institute in Moscow stopped their scientific studies for
two hours, said Galina Koslovsky, an interpreter for the institute.
They spent the time writing a resolution supporting the deputies'
call for a vote on Article 6 and critical economic reforms, then
sent the text to the Kremlin before returning to work.
   In Latvia, some store clerks and transport workers heeded the
Latvian Popular Front's call to show solidarity with Sakharov's
call through a work stoppage of 15 minutes, said Maris Melans of
Atmoda, the Popular Front newspaper.
   The Soviet Communist Party is facing unprecedented challenges to
its monopoly on power. The Lithuanian legislature voted last week
to eliminate the party's constitutional guarantee of supremacy in
that republic.
   Estonians and Latvians voted for new city and regional council
members in elections viewed as a referendum on the Communist Party
and the independence of the two republics from Moscow. Communist
officials faced overwhelming defeat.
   All three Baltic republics were annexed by the Kremlin in 1940.
   The elections Sunday were the first in the Soviet Union to
include candidates from de facto alternative political parties.
First results were not expected until later today at the earliest.
   In Moscow on Sunday, 5,000 people marched in sub-zero
temperatures in support of reformist lawmakers. Police did not stop
that protest, but they pushed several hundred others off Pushkin
Square after speakers ripped up photographs of Gorbachev and Soviet
founder Vladimir Lenin.
   Demonstrators chanted, ``Freedom! Freedom!'' as the helmeted
riot police punched, shoved and kicked them. Tass said 20 people
were detained.
   Boris Yeltsin, an unorthodox member of the 250-member Central
Committee, told fellow reformers that Saturday's committee meeting
was dominated by conservatives complaining about Gorbachev's
changes.
   A conservative Central Committee member, speaking Sunday on
condition of anonymity, said Gorbachev offered to resign after
Kemerevo party chief Alexander Melnikov ``really let himself get
carried away and said something like this: `Is it proper to go
bowing to the capitalists, to go asking a blessing from the Pope?'''
   The source, who attended the meeting, said Gorbachev was irked
by the criticism of his moves to make peace with the West, and
offered to step down if the full committee agreed with Melnikov.
   Other members immediately voiced support for Gorbachev and
Melnikov apologized, the source said.
   Gorbachev warned that the situation in the Soviet Union is
``unbelievably crucial,'' according to the transcript of his speech
carried by Tass.
   ``The Soviet people do not want to put up with the fact that at
a time when the normal rhythm of life has been broken, their local
and national leaders are often doing nothing,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said he was willing to accept a change in the
Communist Party's constitutional guarantee of supremacy, but not
immediately, Tass said. He said it should come only as part of
sweeping constitutional reforms.
   Gorbachev cited the nation's serious economic troubles in
arguing that the second session of the Congress of People's
Deputies, which begins Tuesday, must concentrate on economic
reforms and not veer off into a discussion of constitutional issues.

   Operation Rescue leaders say they will bring
their anti-abortion activities back to Atlanta starting Friday,
including picketing at clinics and the homes of those perceived as
backers of legal abortions.
   Thousands of the group's followers have been arrested in
demonstrations across the country since Operation Rescue rose to
prominence in Atlanta with demonstrations during the 1988
Democratic National Convention.
   ``We are going to have rescues and they are going to be
reinforced,'' said Michael Hirsh, Atlanta director of Operation
Rescue. ``It's going to be a concerted effort from a number of
different directions.''
   Crowd control has been taken from the Atlanta Police
Department's 5th Precinct and given to the Special Operations
division.
   Division chief Maj. W.W. Holley said officers will be taken from
other details such as robbery stakeouts to keep order.
   ``We will give them a reasonable time to disperse from the
property and if they refuse they will be subject to arrest,'' he
said.
   Holley said the behavior of the demonstrators will determine
whether controversial, painful ``come-along'' holds are used in
making arrests. Police were criticized for overuse of the tactics
in some previous demonstrations.
   Pro-choice groups say they will hold counterdemonstrations
wherever Operation Rescue appears.
   Operation Rescue's national director, Randall Terry, is serving
a two-year term in a state prison north of Atlanta for his part in
past demonstrations. He chose the jail term over a fine and
banishment from the Atlanta area.

   The Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, today welcomed Eastern Europe's non-violent revolution and
hoped for the day when his homeland of Tibet would celebrate its
own triumph over Chinese occupation.
   China today lodged a protest with Norway over Sunday's
presentation of the award to the Tibetan spiritual leader and said
the official Norwegian participation would ``greatly impair''
relations.
   In a separate ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, on Sunday, King
Carl XVI Gustaf awarded gold Nobel medallions to nine laureates who
won the prizes for literature, chemistry, physics, medicine and
economic sciences. Six were Americans.
   In keeping with tradition, the peace prize winner gives a
lecture at the University of Olso.
   The Dalai Lama said in a text prepared for today's lecture that
``the awarding of the Nobel Prize to me, a simple monk from
far-away Tibet, here in Norway, also fills us Tibetans with hope.''
   The exiled leader then said he wanted to speak about human
understanding, compassion and love ``instead of reading my speech.''
   His one-hour impromptu talk concentrated on moral and ethical
questions illustrated with homilies that often provoked laughter
from the audience of 600.
   The Dalai Lama said he will use the $469,000 peace prize to help
starving people, lepers in India, various peace programs and to
establish the Tibetan Foundation for Universal Responsibility.
   At Sunday's ceremony attended by Norwegian King Olav V and other
government officials, he said China's rejection of his 1987 peace
plan was forcing him to rethink his approach and that he might
withdraw his proposal.
   But, he added: ``Our struggle must remain non-violent and free
of hatred.''
   ``I accept the prize with profound gratitude on behalf of the
oppressed everywhere and for all those who struggle for freedom and
work for world peace,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama, 54, was chosen at age 5 as the reincarnation of
Tibet's god-king, making him religious and political head of the
isolated mountain nation. He fled into exile in India after a
failed uprising in 1959. China has ruled Tibet for 40 years.
   The Dalai Lama has called for Tibetan autonomy over domestic
matters, with China retaining control over military and diplomatic
affairs. Beijing has rejected the formula.
   The Dalai Lama said the Chinese had ``become even more
repressive'' since the announcement in October that he was
receiving the peace prize. He said several Tibetans were sentenced
to up to 19 years in prison last week, ``possibly ... to intimidate
the population before today's event.''
   ``China cannot escape the impact of this spirit of freedom
sweeping many parts of the world,'' he said, citing the political
changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   In Beijing, the official Xinhua News Agency said an unidentified
official of the Foreign Ministry lodged a protest in a meeting with
Norway's Ambassador to China, Jan Tore Holvik.
   The official said the presence of Norwegian leaders at the award
ceremony ``constituted an open support to the Dalai clique's
activities aimed at splitting China and a gross interference in
China's internal affairs.''
   The Dalai Lama was the 70th recipient since the first peace
prizes were awarded in 1901 from the estate of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish inventor of dynamite.
   Spanish writer Camilo Jose Cela received the prize for
literature.
   Americans J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus won the Nobel
Prize for medicine; Americans Norman F. Ramsey and Hans G. Dehmelt
and Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for physics; Americans Sidney
Altman and Thomas R. Cech for chemistry, and Trygve Haavelmo of
Norway for economics.
   The Stockholm honors, a highlight of Sweden's social calendar,
were broadcast on national television. Each prize was worth
$469,000, which was divided in those categories where there was
more than one winner.
   Cela is the author of the 1942 novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duarte.'' He said he accepted the prize on behalf of ``those who
have the glorious Spanish language for their own.''
   Varmus, of the University of California at San Francisco, cited
the 8th century English poem Beowulf in his remarks about
scientific challenges.
   ``We recognize that, unlike Beowulf, we have not slaughtered the
cancer cell, we have only seen our enemy more clearly,'' he said.
   Varmus and Bishop shared the prize for their work with
oncogenes, dealing with how some tumors develop.
   Altman of Yale University, also speaking for fellow laureate
Cech of the University of Colorado, said he hoped scientists and
intellectuals around the world would gain the freedom of thought
enjoyed in the United States.
   They received the prize for discovering catalytic properties in
the genetic material RNA.
   Ramsey was honored as a developer of the atomic clock and the
other physics winners, Paul and Dehmelt, were named for developing
tools to trap and study single atoms or ions.
   Haavelmo accepted the economics prize for developing theories of
econometrics.

   A teacher who was forced from his
job after refusing to wear a necktie returned to the classroom
today after tying his adversaries in legal knots. He wore a flannel
shirt and jeans _ no tie.
   One year ago this month, the Mason County Board of Education
fired Bill Webb for refusing to conform to a new dress code. Today,
he returned to the classroom at Point Pleasant High School with the
power of a judge's recent order.
   Principal Michael Whalen refused to let reporters into the
school building this morning, saying, ``We're going to have a
normal school day.''
   Assistant Principal Larry Martin said Webb, 46, showed up for
work wearing flannel and denim.
   ``I'm a little bit apprehensive, I guess,'' Webb said Sunday
night. ``When I left there, it was under strange circumstances.
It's going to be a little strange going in.''
   Students who gathered outside a fast food restaurant near school
began said today that Webb's return was not a major event.
   ``I like him. He's all right,'' said senior Donnie Patterson,
adding that there was little discussion about Webb's case.
   Webb, who has been teaching math at Point Pleasant for 21 years,
contends that the school board doesn't have a right to tell him
what to wear.
   Webb _ and Kanawha County Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman _ say the
dress code is unconstitutional. Webb said the code shouldn't apply
to him anyway because it was put into effect after he had signed
his contract for the 1988-89 school year.
   Mason school board officials haven't given up on overturning
Kaufman's ruling, but they have consented to allow Webb to return
to work while the state Supreme Court considers their appeal.
   Webb, who gave up wearing more formal attire shortly after he
started teaching, said he will continue wearing denim shirts, work
boots and jeans to the classroom.
   Webb, who also farms part time, chose that style of dress
shortly after he came to Point Pleasant, saying that dress clothes
hampered his ability to communicate with students.
   ``There's so many things in my life that I do enjoy, but the one
thing I really enjoy is the interaction with the kids,'' Webb said.

<HEAD>Woman Loses Challenge to Iowa Seatbelt Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iowa woman battling her state's mandatory
seatbelt law lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear Linda Diane
Clark's arguments that the law, similar to those in most states,
violates her constitutional rights.
   Mrs. Clark, a Marshalltown housewife, was ticketed April 26,
1988 for not wearing a seatbelt while teaching her daughter how to
drive the family car.
   The violation carries a $10 fine. With court costs, Mrs. Clark
faced paying $21.50.
   Challenging her jury-trial conviction through the Iowa courts
and to the Supreme Court has cost her ``about $1,000 so far,'' Mrs.
Clark said in a recent telephone interview. ``Lots of people said,
`Why don't you just pay the $21.50,' but it's the principle of the
thing.''
   The last bill Mrs. Clark received _ she has yet to pay the fine
or any court costs _ was for $66.50.
   Mrs. Clark acted as her own lawyer throughout the unsuccessful
court fight.
   The Iowa Supreme Court ruled in another case that the state law
is constitutional, and spent just two paragraphs in upholding Mrs.
Clark's conviction last Sept. 18.
   In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. Clark said, ``This case
provides the court with an opportunity to delineate the boundaries
of state action as regards inalienable rights of the individual
citizens.''
   Arguing that the safety of wearing seatbelts is questionable,
Mrs. Clark's appeal said, ``When state regulation causes injury and
death by an unproven speculative measure of safety, a justiciable
controversy exists.''
   Mrs. Clark told The Associated Press she believes her right to
travel and her right to be free from unnecessary government
regulation is violated by the seatbelt law.
   ``In a free country, they can't do that,'' she said.
   Mrs. Clark said she has no doubt the time and money invested in
her court case was well spent.
   Quoting from a 1950 dissenting opinion by the late Supreme Court
Justice Hugo Black, Mrs. Clark said: ``It is not the function of
our government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is
the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling
into error.''
   The case is Clark vs. Iowa, 89-687.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a former gambling casino owner convicted of bank fraud and ordered
to pay $7.5 million in restitution.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling against
businessman Ronald Cloud stemming from the 1985 sale of his
hotel-casino complex in the Lake Tahoe area on the
California-Nevada border.
   Cloud purchased the complex, the Cal-Neva Lodge, for $10 million
in 1980 and decided to sell it a few years later because of
mounting operating losses.
   Jon Perroton agreed to buy the complex for $17 million. But
Perroton got a $20 million loan from the Hibernia Bank to finance
the purchase after misrepresenting the sale price as $27.5 million.
   Perroton pleaded guilty to bank fraud and other charges, and was
sentenced to 20 years in prison.
   Cloud was convicted by a federal jury of aiding and abetting
bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
   He was placed on probation for five years, fined $500,000 and
ordered to pay $7.5 million to Continental Insurance Co. to
reimburse it for some of the money it paid to the Hibernia Bank.
   Cloud said he went along innocently with the phony loan amount
on assurances from Perroton that there was nothing wrong with it.
Cloud said he never intended to defraud the bank and was a victim
of Perroton's scheme.
   Cloud also said he should not be forced to pay the insurance
company $7.5 million because he previously reached a settlement
with the Hibernia Bank to repay it $1.5 million.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his appeal last
April.
   The appeals court said there was sufficient evidence to convict
Cloud, and a federal judge who ordered the restitution acted under
proper authority granted by the federal Victim and Witness
Protection Act.
   The case is Cloud vs. U.S., 89-455.

<TEXT>
   Sirens wailed, horns honked and
bells pealed at noon today in Prague and other cities to mark a
dramatic opposition victory that ended the Communists' 41-year
domination of the government.
   Also today, army units began pulling down the Iron Curtain
border with neutral Austria and Prague radio reported that Pacem Im
Terris, the state-controlled organization of Roman Catholic clergy,
will shut down.
   The organization was viewed by indepedendent priests and bishops
as a tool of the Communists, and Pope John Paul II declared it
illegal several years ago. Several ranking figures in Pacem im
Terris were dismissed last week after being accused of cooperating
with the secret police.
   On Sunday, in his last act as president, Gustav Husak swore in a
Cabinet whose members include people he had jailed or stripped of
all but the most menial jobs. The new Cabinet gave the country its
first government dominated by non-Communists since 1948.
   Today's three-minute demonstration took the place of a general
strike called off Sunday by opposition leaders after their historic
success in overturning Communist domination of the government.
   Around Prague's Wenceslas Square, the site of huge pro-democracy
protests the last three weeks, thousands of Christmas shoppers and
workers on lunch break joined in the three-minute demonstration of
support, ringing tiny bells or shaking sets of keys.
   On nearby Old Town Square, the deep gong of the bells from Tyn
Church echoed off the ancient buildings. Above a large Christmas
tree, young people leaned out of a third-floor window as the bells
and sirens sounded.
   ``This is the end of communism,'' said Jana Navara, a
27-year-old actress, ringing a brass chime in Old Town Square.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe today:
   _ The four World War II Allies _ France, Britain, the United
States and the Soviet Union _ met in Berlin for the first time
since 1971. The Soviets expressed ``favorable interest'' in a
Western plan to boost the international role of Berlin, according
to a joint statement.
   _ Bulgaria's Communist Central Committee opened a session to
discuss the situation in the country one day after tens of
thousands demonstrated for reform and curbs on party power.
   _ Most Soviets ignored a call by human rights activist Andrei
Sakharov for a two-hour general strike to demand an end to
Communist Party domination, according to reports reaching Moscow.
   _ The leadership of Yugoslavia's second-largest state, Croatia,
for the first time called for the establishment of a multiparty
system in the Communist country.
   Czechoslovak army units began pulling down barbed wire fencing
along a 20-mile stretch of its border with Austria. After the first
stretch of the frence was cut away and rolled up, officials from
both countries met on the open border near the Austrian town of
Wullowitz to shake hands.
   The radio said some Communist Party cells at state enterprises
charged with indoctrination and other political work had disbanded,
although not formally required to do so.
   In Brno, opposition leaders said today's noontime demonstration
was to show support for opposition leader Vaclav Havel, who is
considered a favorite to succeed Husak. Posters plastered
throughout central Prague showed a smiling Havel with the caption,
``Havel to the Castle,'' a reference to the seat of the presidency.
   On Sunday, the 53-year-old playwright told a cheering crowd of
100,000 in Prague that the new government was ``a great success.''
   ``This peaceful revolution was ... against violence, dirt,
mafias, privileges, persecutions,'' the once-banned playwright said
in the nationally televised speech. ``Let us preserve its purity,
peacefulness, love and merry, friendly flair.''
   The new ``government of national understanding'' contains 10
Communists, two of whom enjoy opposition support, seven non-party
members and two members each from the small Socialist and People's
parties, which recently broke with the Communists.
   It includes two men who just weeks ago were persecuted as
dissidents.
   In a key compromise, the Interior Ministry, which runs the
nation's hated secret and uniformed police, will be run jointly by
a former dissident, the new Communist premier and a Communist Party
member proposed by the opposition.
   The new government was sworn in by Husak, 76, the man
responsible for the 21 years of repression after a Soviet-led
invasion crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968. Husak, who
presided over the jailing and firing of hundreds of thousands of
people as Communist Party chief, then resigned.
   In addition to Havel, `Prague Spring' reform leader Alexander
Dubcek has been named as a candidate for president, to be chosen by
Parliament this month. Dubcek, 68, had been replaced as Communist
Party chief by Husak.
   The new Czechoslovak government marks a triumph of the
persecuted over their persecutors. The new foreign minister, Jiri
Dienstbier, was jailed with Havel from 1979 to 1982 for battling
for human rights. A new first deputy premier, Jan Carnogursky, is a
Slovak lawyer and Roman Catholic activist freed from jail just two
weeks ago.
   Gen. Miroslav Vacek, a Communist, remained defense minister, but
the Interior Ministry will be run by the new premier, Marian Calfa;
First Vice Premier Valtr Komarek, a Communist Party member proposed
by the opposition; and Carnogursky. Havel said Carnogursky will
oversee the secret police, who once hounded him.
   Parliament, which meets Tuesday, has two weeks to choose a new
president. The opposition coalition Civic Forum and its Slovak
counterpart, Public Against Violence, were formed Nov. 19 _ two
days after riot police brutally beat peaceful demonstrators in
Prague.
   Czechs and Slovaks were taking to the streets by the hundreds of
thousands to demand a government of their choosing. The ruling
Communist Party has since lost its constitutionally guaranteed
monopoly on power and all its hard-line leaders have been removed.
   The state news agency CTK said the students who started the mass
movement for democracy decided Sunday night to continue their
nationwide three-week sit-in strike. CTK gave no reasons for the
decision.
   The new government is supposed to lay down the legal basis for
democracy and pave the way for free elections.

<HEAD>NAACP Beverly Hills-Hollywood Chapter President Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The embattled president of the NAACP's
Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter has resigned, just days before the
national organization begins an investigation into allegations he
mismanaged the chapter.
   Willis Edwards announced his resignation during the taping of
the Image Awards ceremony honoring blacks in the entertainment
industry and to be aired next month on NBC-TV.
   ``Two years ago I vowed that if the Image Awards would
successfully be on television for four years and if the Beverly
Hills-Hollywood NAACP developed a strong bond with the industry, my
job was done,'' Edwards said Saturday night during the taping at
the Wiltern Theater.
   But his resignation comes several days before an inquiry by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People into
allegations Edwards mismanaged the chapter.
   Edwards was criticized for accepting $25,000 for helping produce
last year's Image Awards show. He has also drawn fire from some
chapter members for what they claim is his lack of aggressiveness
in pursuing civil rights issues and alleged mismanagement of
chapter funds.
   ``We're glad he resigned,'' said Connie Watson, leader of the
chapter's dissidents, on Sunday.
   Ms. Watson was one of several protesters who picketed outside
the Wiltern on Saturday night, waving placards that accused Edwards
with statements such as: ``What Have You Done For Civil Rights
Lately?''
   After his statement Saturday, Edwards would only say, ``I
resigned because I wanted to resign.''
   An NAACP national panel scheduled a Dec. 19 hearing in Hollywood
on the mismanagement allegations. Last September, chapter members
voted for Edwards' resignation after he accepted the $25,000 for
his work on the 1988 Image Awards show.
   Edwards has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``There has been lots of turmoil. We've got some bridges to
mend,'' said the new chapter president, Sandra Evers-Manly, who
will remain at the post until elections are held in 1990.

<TEXT>
   The Communists' policy-setting Central
Committee met today following the nation's largest pro-democracy
rally in which tens of thousands of people demanded that party
leaders share power.
   Also today, the municipal court in Sofia approved the
registration application of Ecoglasnost, making the environmental
organization Bulgaria's first legal independent political group.
   Party leader Petar Mladenov opened the Central Committee session
with a speech on ``the situation in the country, the party and the
immediate tasks,'' the state news agency BTA said. The dispatch
gave no further details.
   About 5,000 people held a silent vigil in 14-degree temperatures
earlier in the day outside party headquarters to show the Communist
leadership the people were watching its work, according to
organizers.
   On Sunday, more than 50,000 people chanted ``Democracy!'' and
applauded demands for the Communist leadership to quit. It was the
biggest rally of its kind since Bulgaria's pro-democracy movement
began less than a month ago and since the party consolidated power
43 years ago.
   Many people held candles in the bright sunshine at today's
vigil, and a white, red and green Bulgarian flag waved on a
platform set up behind the Central Committee building.
   Police set up barriers to keep the gathering from disrupting
morning traffic, and a few officers stood at a distance around the
crowd. After one hour, the crowd dispersed quietly.
   Organizers said similar vigils would be held later today and on
Tuesday.
   The Central Committee meeting was expected to last at least two
days and focus on growing grass-roots demands for the kind of
democratic reforms that have swept Poland, Hungary, East Germany
and Czechoslovakia.
   The Central Committee also met Friday in a session that was not
announced, and 22 people were removed from the Committee and four
from the ruling Politburo.
   If the Committee were to resign, a new one would have to be
elected at a party congress.
   The Communist Party daily Rabotnichesko Delo today carried a
guest commentary in which the author urged an extraordinary
congress to be held as soon as posible and suggested the end of
February as a possible date.
   The paper said it had received more than 4,000 letters and
telephone calls from people demanding reforms since Nov. 10, when
Mladenov replaced Todor Zhivkov, who was Communist Party chief for
35 years.
   A poll conducted by a Central Committee polling group indicated
that only 23 percent of those questioned had a lot of trust in the
party, the newspaper reported.
   It said 1,513 people from 127 work collectives were questioned
in the poll, conducted Nov. 28.
   The newspaper said only 32 percent showed general trust in any
political organizations. It concluded that the Communists had
``discredited themselves in the eyes of the people,'' while
opposition groups had not had a chance to test their political
ability.
   Sunday's rally was organized by 19 independent groups that
drafted a resolution urging talks between the Communists and the
groups.
   Protesters waved their hands in the air to show approval of the
resolution, which recognized moves toward liberalization since
Zhivkov was ousted. But it complained that reform was too slow in
coming.
   Popular pressure for the party to give up its constitutionally
guaranteed leading role has been growing, and the crowd repeatedly
cheered that demand.
   Last week, Mladenov told a news conference in Moscow that he
foresaw changes in the constitution and indicated the party's
leading role was an open question.
   The municipal court in Sofia has previously rejected
Ecoglasnost's application for legal status as an independent
political group. It changed its mind three days before Parliament
is to meet to discuss issues including a proposed law on
associations.
   Ecoglasnost has played a key role in mobilizing people to press
for reforms. It also a member of the newly formed umbrella Union of
Democratic Forces, which comprises the 10 most influential
independent groups.
   Petar Slabokov, a well-known actor and the president of
Ecoglasnost, said one of the group's first projects will be to
determine whether the general health of people has been damaged by
air and river pollution.

   In a decision narrowing the reach of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Supreme Court today shielded the
FBI from having to give Grumman Corp. documents received from
another government agency.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents can be withheld
because they were ``compiled for law enforcement purposes'' _ and
therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing
government secrecy.
   Grumman and the Defense Contract Audit Agency exchanged letters
in 1978. In the exchange, the Pentagon agency questioned certain
accounting practices Grumman used for defense contracts. Grumman
defended its practices, and no government action was taken.
   The FBI began a criminal investigation of Grumman in 1985, and
the exchange of letters was sent from the audit agency to the FBI.
   Grumman filed an FOIA lawsuit in 1987 seeking ``all documents
that are related in any way to the subject of the (1978)
correspondence.''
   A federal judge ruled against the contractor, saying release of
the documents would jeopardize a grand jury investigation.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City ruled
that the FOIA requires release of the documents.
   The appeals court said the exemption for documents compiled for
law enforcement purposes does not apply in this case because the
letters were not originally obtained or generated for law
enforcement purposes.
   Today, the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong about
the exemption's scope.
   ``Documents having been compiled once for the purpose of routine
audits wer not disqualified from being compiled again later for a
different purpose,'' Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court.
   ``We do not accept the distinction the court of appeals drew
between documents that originally were assembled for law
enforcement purposes and those that were not so originally
assembled,'' he said.
   Blackmun said sought-after documents may fall under the FOIA
exemption if they have been gathered or stored by a law enforcement
agency ``when the response to the FOIA request must be made.''
   Blackmun's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, Sandra
Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Thurgood Marshall
dissented.
   The case is John Doe Agency vs. John Doe Corp., 88-1083.

   An off-duty police officer and a 26-year-old
woman were shot to death in the second slaying of a Houston police
officer in two days, authorities said.
   Officer John Mendell, 43, and Mary Heather Ballard were killed
Sunday night at the woman's apartment, officials said. Mendell was
a 17-year veteran of the force.
   Police believe the shooting resulted from a domestic dispute
involving a man who was the officer's roommate. The man had once
dated Ms. Ballard, police said.
   Shortly after the shootings, the roommate turned himself in to
police in Bellarie, a Houston suburb, in connection with the
slayings, said police Sgt. David Preece. His name was not
immediately released.
   On Saturday, Officer James Charles Boswell, 29, was shot by a
man who approached him in his car.
   Craig Neal Ogan, 35, who is charged with capital murder in the
shooting, was a federal drug informant in St. Louis but wasn't
involved in any narcotics investigation in Houston, said John Bott,
a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman here.
   ``I do know for a fact that he was working for us up there. As
far as what he was doing up there, I don't know,'' Bott said.
   Police said Ogan, who previously lived in Houston, had checked
into a motel and complained about the heat and telephone service.
He threatened the clerk before walking across the street to
Boswell's patrol car, where he shot the officer, police said.
   Ogan was shot by Boswell's partner. He was in fair condition
today at Ben Taub and under guard by sheriff's deputies.

   An opposition campaign rally turned
into a riot in which one person was killed and more than 20 people
injured. Foreign observers blamed the violence on Sandinista
provocateurs.
   Sunday's violence lasted four hours and was the worst of the
campaign leading to general elections set for Feb. 25. Foreigners
said the clashes raised doubts the balloting would be held without
incident.
   Opponents and supporters of the ruling Sandinistas fought with
machetes, knives, broken bottles, rocks and sticks in this town 30
miles south of Managua. The local Sandinista Front headquarters was
sacked, and two vehicles were burned.
   Manuel Guevara Calero, 38, of the nearby village of La
Concepcion was stabbed to death. Reports in pro-government
newspapers today quoted his mother, Hilda Calero, and an
unidentified relative as blaming supporters of the National
Opposition Union, or UNO.
   ``I came here assuming that there would be free and open
elections,'' said Robert Beckel of the Washington-based Center for
Democracy, a bipartisan group invited to observe the electoral
process. ``You can't witness what we saw today and believe there's
any way there'll be a fair election in this country.''
   The opposition has accused Sandinista gangs of disrupting
earlier opposition rallies.
   Sunday's fighting broke out during a rally organized by the UNO
when a group of about 20 Sandinista loyalists and opposition
followers exchanged insults and then blows in this town of 15,000
people.
   Beckel and an opposition organizer, Jeremias Mahmud, said a
series of provocations by Sandinista supporters sparked the riot.
   ``It's very clear to me that (Sandinista) supporters were
constantly probing the perimeter of this rally looking to disrupt
it,'' said Beckel, who managed Democrat Walter Mondale's 1984
presidential campaign. ``It was too clear: they showed up at
specific times and the police disappeared.''
   Lt. Fernando Montoya, Masatepe police chief, said he had been
ordered to keep police away from the rally. He said he did not want
to give opponents of the leftist Sandinistas ``a pretext for them
to say that we were there to repress them.''
   Witnesses said at least 20 people were injured. They said
Sandinista activists threw rocks during an opposition march,
reappeared to trade insults with the crowd while candidates were
delivering speeches and withdrew after being admonished by
observers from the Organization of American States.
   The Sandinista militants appeared again after the event had
ended and the opposition crowd, estimated at about 2,000, was
dispersing.
   People were slashed with machetes, knives and broken bottles;
rocks were thrown and people hit with sticks.
   Beckel said he was pushed to the ground as opposition and
Sandinista supporters threw stones at each other. He said rescued a
girl about 5 years old who apparently became separated from her
mother.
   ``The girl ... was getting trampled so I pulled her out from
underneath it,'' Beckel said. ``The machetes came out and we were
four feet from the fighting.''
   Beckel was hit on the back of the head and hurt slightly. He
said he and the little girl crawled away, then ran.
   Ricardo Lopez Cerda, a member of the Sandinista campaign
committee, said he and 12 other people had taken refuge in the
party headquarters when he saw about 200 people approach. Lopez
said he heard the crowd shout that they were coming to kill
everyone inside.
   He and the others escaped through the back of the building. The
building was heavily damaged and the furniture inside burned. A
home next door also was sacked, and a jeep and a motorcycle set
ablaze.
   On Dec. 3, a group of Sandinista supporters attacked a house
being inaugrated as the local opposition coalition headquarters in
Cofradias, a village 12 miles east of Managua. Dozens of people
were injured in a rock-throwing melee.
   Presdent Daniel Ortega moved up the general elections by a year
as part of an agreement by Central American to end regional
insurgencies.
   The U.S.-backed Contra rebels have fought the Sandinistas since
1981 and are based in neighborning Honduras. Under the Aug. 7
agreement, they were to have been disbanded last week.
   But the Contras remain intact and President Bush has indicated
he wants them to remain a viable force to ensure the Sandinistas
hold clean elections.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa was released
from a hospital today and a nun at her mission said she was doing
well.
   ``We thank everyone who prayed for her during the crucial
days,'' Sister Priscilla said after the 79-year-old Roman Catholic
nun returned to her mission. ``Doctors have advised her complete
rest.''
   Mother Teresa, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work
with the poor, suffered a heart attack on Sept. 5 and was
hospitalized at Woodlands Nursing Home.
   She was released on Oct. 14, but admitted again on Nov. 29 with
high blood pressure and dizziness. Surgeons implanted a pacemaker
on Dec. 1.
   Doctors attributed the illness to her hectic schedule at the
Missionaries of Charity.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the mission in 1959 in an
abandoned hostel donated by the city.
   The order, which was formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965,
expanded and now has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

<HEAD>Iran Said Advising Friends In Lebanon To Release Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran has been advising its ``friends'' in
Lebanon to release their Western hostages, a senior Iranian
official was quoted as saying in a newspaper interview published
today in this Persian Gulf nation.
   ``We have directed our advice to our friends in Lebanon to cease
their acts with respect to the kidnapping of the Western
hostages,'' the newspaper Al-Raya quoted Deputy Foreign Minister
Ali Mohammed Besharati as saying.
   ``But the problem is that every time the atmosphere becomes
propitious for the release of the hostages, there are
counter-incidents that cloud the atmosphere,'' said Besharati, who
was on a two-day visit that ended Sunday.
   The paper said he was specifically referring to the kidnapping
by Israeli commandos of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem
preacher from south Lebanon, on July 28.
   On July 31, Shiite Moslem kidnappers of the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth said they killed their American hostage Lt. Col.
William Higgins in retaliation for the kidnapping.
   Most of the 18 Western hostages held in Lebanon are believed to
be in the hands of Iranian-backed Shiite groups. They are eight
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman
and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985, in west Beirut.
   The death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the election of the
more pragmatic President Hashemi Rafsanjani gave rise to some hopes
of Iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives.

<HEAD>Report: NY State National Guard Sapped By No-Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No-show or consistently AWOL National Guard
soldiers have inflated federal funding to New York state and given
officials the false impression that the force is combat-ready, a
newspaper reported today.
   Between 1,600 and 4,000 National Guard soldiers in the state are
absent without leave and should be dismissed, the New York Post
said.
   No-shows are not paid, but the Pentagon sets minimum manpower
requirements and provides funds for equipment and training based on
those numbers.
   The newspaper said its investigation concluded that the phantom
force was created in 1984 by Vito Castellano, commander of the New
York state guard from 1975 to 1986 who became ensnared in the
Wedtech scandal.
   Castellano was released from prison in July after serving one
year for taking bribes and using his position to lobby for Wedtech,
the defunct defense contractor.
   Castellano could not be reached today for comment on the Post
report. Calls this morning to a telephone listed in his name in a
New York suburb went unanswered.
   Lt. Col. James O'Toole, the state Guard's personnel director,
said ``probably'' about 1,600 Guard members should be discharged
for absenteeism. But reports indicated the figure may be much
higher. Federal regulations say soldiers with nine unexcused
absences must be dismissed.
   A congressional report said that in the 1988 New York Guard
training session, absenteeism was 32 percent, the Post said.
   And a confidential Guard report, a military personnel profile
for its New York City division, the 42nd, showed that 3,367
guardsmen have been absent from drills and training sessions at
least nine times, the newspaper said.
   Maj. Gen. Lawrence P. Flynn, commander of the state Guard, said
he was keeping no-shows on the roster, despite the rules, in hopes
they could be restored to active duty. It is cheaper than
recruiting new soldiers, he said.
   He could not provide figures on how many absentee guardsmen had
returned to duty.
   If the absentees are dismissed, the Pentagon will have to
classify New York as unprepared for combat, according to the report.
   The New York National Guard already has the second worst
attendance records in the nation, but its budget has tripled since
1975 to $390 million, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified former top Castellano aide
as saying that Castellano ordered absentee guardsmen kept on the
roster.

<TEXT>
   The leadership of Yugoslavia's
second-largest state today for the first time called for the
establishment of a multiparty system in this Communist country.
   Communists have been slow in realizing the ``historic exhaustion
of the single-party system,'' Stanko Stojicevic, head of the
Croatian Communist Party's ruling presidium, said at the opening of
a regional party congress in the Croatian capital of Zagreb.
   ``There can be no democratic socialism without political
pluralism based on the right of association and competition of
political (movements) and programs,'' Stojicevic said in his
keynote speech carried by the state Tanjug news agency.
   Until now the liberal northern state of Slovenia was the only
one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics to openly advocate
the introduction of Western-style democracy.
   About a dozen independent movements and parties have been set up
in Slovenia over the past year, and the region plans to hold its
first free legislative elections next March.
   On Sunday some 25,000 people in several Croatian cities signed a
petition urging legalization of numerous parties that would make
possible the holding of free elections in the republic bordering
Slovenia in the West.
   ``We consider that (Yugoslavia's new constitution) should
provide for a political system that will include ... parties and
movements representing the political interests of citizens,'' said
Stojicevic, according to a report broadcast by Zagreb radio.
   Croatia and some other republics have in the past been
non-committal about multiparty democracy, which is vehemently
opposed by the Communist leadership of the country's largest state
of Serbia.
   Earlier this month Serbia, in an apparent move to stifle
burgeoning democratic trends in the country, severed all business
and official ties with Slovenia. The unprecedented action shook the
foundations of Yugoslavia's loose federal system.
   Stojicevic sharply denounced Serbia's break with Slovenia,
describing the consequences as ``dramatic with a possibly
catastrophic outcome.''
   ``Ultimatums and the severance of economic relations,
accusations and threats represent a direct attack on the
constitutional order of the country and its economic and political
integrity,'' Stojicevic said.
   Slovenia's parliament met today to discuss Serbia's actions,
which Slovenian president Janez Stanovik said were a ``heavy blow
to the Yugoslav federation.''
   He said Serbia was trying to ``eliminate all those who hold
differing opinions and to produce a change of the constitutional
order.''
   ``The blockade of Slovenia, therefore, represents an act of
aggression against Yugoslavia,'' he told lawmakers.
   Croatia's state leadership, which had earlier sought to remain
on the sidelines of the dispute between Serbia and Slovenia, came
out strongly last week in favor of Slovenia.
   Croats and Serbs are traditional arch-rivals in Yugoslavia's
patchwork of nationalities, and an open clash between the two
regions could seriously threaten the unity of this Balkan nation.
   Yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its
one-party system.
   But political, economic, social and ethnic problems have
mushroomed since the death in 1980 of President Josip Broz Tito,
whose charisma was seen as a major force in bounding together the
divergent ethnic groups in the country.

   A former congressman convicted of racketeering
was disbarred by the Supreme Court today, and an ousted federal
judge had his high court license suspended, a first step in the
disbarment process.
   In a brief order, the justices stripped former Rep. Mario
Biaggi, D-N.Y., of his license to practice law at the nation's
highest court.
   And in a separate order, the court suspended former U.S.
District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr.'s license.
   Biaggi, who served 10 terms in Congress, resigned from the House
of Representatives last year following his conviction on charges
that he illegally took $1.8 million in stocks and cash from the
scandal-ridden Wedtech Corp., a defense contractor based in New
York City. He was sentenced to eight years in prison.
   Biaggi was disbarred from practicing law in New York last
September.
   In a separate order, the court suspended Nixon's license to
practice in the Supreme Court and gave him 40 days ``to show cause
why he should not be disbarred from the practice of law in this
court.''
   The former judge was convicted in 1986 of two counts of lying to
a grand jury about his handling of a drug-smuggling case against
the son of a businessman with whom Nixon had invested. Nixon is
serving a five-year sentence.
   He was impeached, and then convicted by the Senate on Nov. 3.

<HEAD>Former Klan Leader Duke Swamped in GOP Caucuses For Louisiana Senate
Nod</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state senator beat former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke in Republican caucuses to stake an early claim to
the GOP endorsement in next year's U.S. Senate race.
   By winning Saturday's caucuses, Sen. Ben Bagert of New Orleans
became the front-runner heading into the Republican's Jan. 13 state
convention. Bagert won 383, or 70 percent, of the 544 delegates
selected at 14 caucuses.
   At stake is which Republican will win the right to challenge
Democratic incumbent Bennett Johnston.
   Duke, who was elected as a state representative last year amid
controversy because of his racial views, won 27 delegates.
Secretary of State Fox McKeithen won 25 delegates and 109 were
uncommitted.
   However, the victory does not guarantee Bagert the nomination.
An additional 656 delegates still must be chosen, and pledges of
support made at party caucuses are not binding.
   Bagert said the caucus victory gave his candidacy ``a stamp of
approval.''
   Both Bagert and McKeithen have said they'll drop out of the race
if they don't get the party nomination. Duke has said he'll run
even if he isn't endorsed.
   Formal endorsement against Johnston, D-La., also would mean
Republican financial support _ money, party newsletters and
volunteers. However, in Louisiana's unique open primary system,
anyone can register as a candidate, regardless of party, and be
placed on the ballot. The primary is set for Oct. 6, 1990; if no
one gets a majority, the two top finishers will advance to the
November election.
   ``Bagert was by far the strongest candidate,'' said Darryl
Gissel, state Republican Party director.
   Duke, who said he does not expect the party's endorsement,
blamed his weak showing on his late entry into the race.
   ``We've organized this thing for three days. They've been at it
for three months,'' Duke said. ``I'm encouraged, given the time we
spent on it.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that federal
judges may help plaintiffs in age discrimination suits try to find
other possible victims and seek their participation in such suits.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, ruled against Hoffmann-La Roche
Inc., which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off
some 1,200 employees at New Jersey plants.
   The high court said judges in such ``class action'' suits may
help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination,
who may be unaware of the lawsuit, and solicit their participation.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said judges
have discretion to authorize such notices to potential plaintiffs.
That ``serves the legitimate goal of avoiding a multiplicity of
duplicative suits and setting cut-off dates to expedite disposition
of the action,'' he said.
   But, he said, judges ``must be scrupulous to respect judicial
neutrality'' and not give even the appearance that they are
endorsing the suit.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Refused to reinstate former White House aide Lyn Nofziger's
conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left the Reagan
administration.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that overturned Nofziger's 1988 conviction, 90-day jail
sentence and $30,000 fine.
   _ Shielded the FBI from having to give Grumman Corp. documents
received from another government agency, narrowing the reach of the
Freedom of Information Act.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents can be withheld
because they were ``compiled for law enforcement purposes'' and
therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing
government secrecy.
   _ Turned away an appeal by an Iowa woman battling her state's
mandatory seatbelt law.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear Linda Diane
Clark's arguments that the law, similar to those in most states,
violates her constitutional rights.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia
dissented in the age-discrimination case.
   Scalia, writing for both, said nothing in the federal law
against age bias authorizes judges ``to undertake the unheard-of
role of midwifing'' lawsuits against employers.
   Hoffmann-La Roch dismissed some 1,200 workers on Feb. 4, 1985. A
group of older workers, who called the day ``Black Monday'' for
many veteran workers, said a disproportionately high number of
laid-off workers were over 40 years old.
   The group filed a lawsuit, charging the company with violating
the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
   The group's leaders then sought to contact all fired workers
over 40 eligible to join the lawsuit.
   Some 400 fired employees agreed to join. But leaders of the
court battle against the company said they believed there might be
200 additional fired workers who are members of the class allegedly
victimized by age discrimination.
   The leaders sought to contact the missing workers by mail and
notices posted at Hoffmann-La Roche plants.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman ordered the company to
provide the names and addresses of all fired workers. And Ackerman
said once the missing workers are found, they may be sent an
explanation of the suit and a form seeking their consent to join
the court fight.
   The form said the judge authorized the mailing but took no
position on the merits of the case.
   An increased number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big
advantage for the workers because it spreads out court costs. In
seeking workers to join the suit, the leaders of the court fight
asked, but did not require, a $200 contribution to help defray the
costs.
   The Supreme Court today upheld a ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   The case is Hoffmann-La Roche vs. Sperling, 88-1203.

<HEAD>Woman Gives Away Thousands in Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A well-dressed woman has disappeared after
bringing early Christmas cheer to surprised patrons of a motel bar
by handing out $100, $50 and $20 bills.
   A woman who identified herself as Judy Kelly of Boston said she
was competing in a national ``treasure hunt'' against 40 or 50
other people that required her to give money away, according to a
truck driver at the bar who asked that his name not be used.
   The woman checked into a motel on Chicago's southwest side on
Saturday, walked into the lounge and gave $100 bills to each of
three flight attendants sitting at a table, witnesses said.
   ``Merry Christmas,'' said the white-haired woman, in her 50s.
   She pulled the cash from a brown paper lunch bag in her purse.
When she ran out of $100 bills, she apologized and gave out $50s.
When she ran out of those, she apologized and gave out $20 bills,
witnesses said.
   ``It's like `Miracle on 34th Street,''' said waitress Maria
Cross, referring to a movie about a man who says he is the real
Santa Claus.
   By one estimate she gave away $5,000, the Chicago Sun-Times
reported in today's editions.
   Police today could offer no further information on the episode.
   ``As far as I know, she went back to Boston,'' said Patrolman
Charles Nawrocki.
   The woman's identity was not immediately confirmed. The Boston
telephone book has two full pages of Kellys, and those with the
first initial ``J'' fill half a column, and that does not include
suburbanites who might say they are from Boston.
   Ms. Kelly checked out of the motel early Sunday morning, though
she left her car behind in the parking lot, said Sally Mascorro, a
front desk clerk at the Carlton Midway Motor Inn.
   Ms. Kelly had said the car wasn't working and that she would
send a tow truck to get it.
   ``It was towed sometime during the night,'' Linda Wierz,
assistant manager of the motel, said today. ``She said she was
going to arrange for that,'' added Ms. Wierz, who said she had no
further information.
   Police were called when the woman was giving away money.
   An officer at the Chicago Lawn district police station, who
would not give his name, said police took Ms. Kelly to the Bobby
Wright Comprehensive Community Mental Health Center.
   A man there who identified himself as an evaluator there said
Ms. Kelly was taken in and evaluated Saturday night. The man, who
would not give his name, said the woman later left in the company
of the police. He would not provide any other information.
   The woman's generosity caused quite a commotion.
   People tried politely to make Ms. Kelly's acquaintance.
Waitresses called friends and flight attendants from the airport
rushed back to tell co-workers.
   ``They were all coming up and playing stupid like they didn't
know what was going on,'' said Jose Gallegos, 21, an employee of a
neighboring rental car agency, adding that he gave Ms. Kelly a kiss
in return for $100.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
today with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and said he does not
believe Washington and London are drifting apart over West European
unity.
   ``I don't think there are any fences that need mending ... We
feel a special relation to the United Kingdom and to the prime
minister,'' Baker told reporters outside Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing
Street office.
   Baker met with Mrs. Thatcher at the start of a weeklong European
trip seeking allied unity amid the rapid political changes sweeping
Europe. Also on the agenda is the sensitive issue of German
reunification.
   From London, Baker was flying to Berlin tonight. He is scheduled
to meet West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday and visit the
Berlin Wall.
   A call by President Bush at a NATO meeting last week for an
``intensified effort'' by the 12-member European Community to unify
was interpreted by some analysts as a prod to Mrs. Thatcher, the
most outspoken opponent of rapid European integration.
   ``I don't really think there is a drifting apart,'' Baker said
after meeting Mrs. Thatcher. ``I think that there was some
misunderstanding last week with respect to exactly what was meant,'
he added, in apparent reference to Bush's integration call.
   Baker, who flew overnight from Washington, held his first
official talks with Britain's new foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd,
who was appointed six weeks ago, before meeting Mrs. Thatcher.
   His task is to assure them the U.S. ``special relationship''
with Britain is firm and to solicit their views on how the West
should approach the volatile political upheavals in the East
European landscape.
   There is support within the Bush administration for an
acceleration of the political union of Western Europe that might
include a reunited Germany.
   Mrs. Thatcher has doubts even about the current pace. Baker's
stop was added after Bush telephoned the prime minister to assure
her the ``special relationship'' between Washington and London was
intact.
   East Germany opened the Berlin Wall and its other borders a
month ago, permitting thousands of cheering Germans to cross freely
to the West for the first time since 1961. Hundreds danced on the
wall.
   Baker's visit is designed to be low-key in order not to provoke
the Soviet Union.
   ``He is not going to dance on the Berlin Wall,'' said a senior
administration official.
   The six-day trip initially was scheduled as an uneventful winter
meeting later in the week with the foreign ministers of the 15 NATO
countries in Brussels, the headquarters of the Western alliance.
   But political upheavals in East Germany and Czechoslovakia,
following the sharp detour from orthodox communism in Poland and
Hungary, is sending Baker into talks with Western partners in an
atmosphere of uncertainty.
   They will discuss whether Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will continue to encourage change with unrest mounting in East
Germany and the abolition of the Communist party's monopoly of
power in the Soviet republic of Lithuania.
   Managing economic aid for Poland and Hungary and the future of
NATO as a military alliance while East-West tensions recede are
also on Baker's agenda in Brussels.
   There is also the overriding issue of German reunification and a
sharp warning recently from Moscow that a 10-point plan by Kohl and
praised by the State Department was ``fraught with dangerous
consequences.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand has cautioned West Germany
not to push for reunification with ast Germany, saying it could
upset the delicate balance in Europe.
   Other U.S. allies also are anxious about the prospect of a
reunited and mighty Germany even though they are not as outspoken
as the French leader. Their concerns are partly rooted in the
devastation of Europe at the hands of the Germans in World War II.
   A U.S. official acknowledged the Kohl plan ``made a lot of
people nervous,'' including Soviet, French and Polish leaders.
``This is especially so with what is going on in East Germany,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Baker will join President Bush in a meeting with Mitterrand in
the Caribbean island of St. Martin on Saturday.
   The West Europeans will want to know if reports that Baker
thinks Kohl moved too fast on reunification are accurate.
   The Bush administration has deferred most decisions on German
reunification to the West Europeans. At the same time, the allies
would not want to get out of step with the United States on the
touchy issue.

   A year-long scientific analysis of the
photographs and notes brought back by Robert E. Peary establishes
that the explorer reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909, just as
he claimed, the National Geographic Society said today.
   The study was undertaken by the Navigators Foundation, a
non-profit organization that had asserted last February that there
was room for scholarly doubt that the Navy admiral reached his
destination.
   The National Geographic Society sponsored Peary's mission and
has defended the explorer's integrity.
   The foundation said earlier that a page of calculations made by
Peary offered no evidence one way or the other. That page had been
cited by debunkers who claimed that Peary was off course and ended
his quest for the pole 121 miles shy of his destination.
   But in its new report, the navigators' group said today that
modern methods of analyzing at which position the sun stood when a
photograph was taken helped establish the claim by Peary that he
had gotten to the pole.
   ``Our analysis of the data Peary brought back from his journey _
his celestial sights, his diary, his ocean soundings and his
photographs _ has convinced us that their final camp, named Camp
Jesup, was no more than five miles from the pole,'' the foundation
said.
   To conduct its investigation, the foundation compared Peary's
measurements of ocean depths, known as soundings, with modern
profiles of the Arctic Ocean floor. The foundation said this
analysis also supported Peary's account.
   The foundation based its report on a study of 225 cubic feet of
papers on the Peary expedition as well as other documents.
   One of Peary's most vocal detractors is Dennis Rawlins, an
astronomer and historian who in 1988 concluded that Peary had lied
about his location.
   ``Suggesting Peary might not have reached the pole is one thing;
declaring him a fraud is another,'' said National Geographic
President Gilbert M. Grosvenor, in attacking Rawlins' conclusions.

<HEAD>Court Limits How Multinational Corporations Can Use Laws to Reduce
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited the way
multinational corporations can use foreign tax laws to reduce their
U.S. taxes, a ruling the Bush administration said may save the
government hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The court ruled unanimously against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
in a case stemming from operations of Goodyear's British subsidiary
in the early 1970s.
   The British subsidiary of the Ohio-based corporation incurred
net losses in 1972 and 1973, at least under British tax law. The
subsidiary's 1973 loss included British tax deductions that were
not allowed under American law.
   As a result, the British government refunded to the subsidiary
tax payments made there for 1970 and 1971.
   The refunds prompted the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to
recompute the taxes it said Goodyear owed in this country.
   Multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid by
subsidiaries overseas as credits against U.S. taxes.
   In Goodyear's case, since the IRS said American law did not
recognize the 1973 deductions permitted the company in Great
Britain, the corporation's loss was converted into a profit.
   The redetermination had the further effect of wiping out, for
U.S. tax purposes, the foreign tax credits previously allowed
Goodyear in 1970 and 1971.
   As a result, the IRS assessed Goodyear $791,240 in taxes and
interest for 1970 and 1971.
   Goodyear then filed suit in the U.S. Claims Court, saying the
IRS erred in applying American law instead of British law to
determine the company's accumulated profits.
   The claims court ruled against Goodyear. But a federal appeals
court here reversed the decision last year.
   The appeals court said a multinational company is entitled to
use a foreign nation's tax laws to determine accumulated profits
made by a subsidiary in that country.
   The Supreme Court today overruled the appeals court.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in his opinion for the high court,
said the approach favored by Goodyear would lead to unequal tax
treatment for subsidiaries _ as opposed to companies set up as
foreign branches of U.S. corporations _ whenever a foreign
government calculates income differently than in this country.
   That result would not square with federal laws aimed at assuring
tax parity between corporations that operate through foreign
subsidiaries and those that operate through foreign branches,
Marshall said.
   The Justice Department said hundreds of millions of dollars are
at stake, even though U.S. tax law was changed in 1986 to bar
multinationals from using a foreign country's calculation of its
accumulated profits for most future tax payments here.
   The department said more than 25,000 foreign subsidiaries of
U.S. companies do business in more than 100 countries. The
government's most recent figures show the companies claimed more
than $9 billion in foreign tax credits in 1982.

   A fierce ice storm left eight people dead
and two multimillion-dollar television towers in pieces on the
ground, and forecasters said more bad weather was on the way.
   The National Weather Service said a second storm system would
hit the state beginning in the mountains tonight and gradually
spreading east on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The blast of wintry weather that moved into the state over the
weekend spread thick layers of ice on roadways and cut off
electrical service to thousands. Police reported hundreds of
traffic accidents, and at least eight people died.
   Western states also were hit with wintry conditions. At Denver's
Stapleton International Airport, there were extensive delays Sunday
because of the storm but officials said the situation was better
today.
   In Colorado east of the Continental Divide, a slew of car
accidents were reported Sunday, including a 20-car pileup on
Interstate 25 near Johnstown that closed the highway for two hours.
Three people suffered minor injuries in that accident.
   North Dakota residents were bundling up as an arctic mass moved
in. Early this morning, wind chill temperatures were reported from
20 below zero to 50 below zero. Highs today were forecast 5 below
to 5 above, with lows tonight from 10 below to 20 below.
   In North Carolina, towers for WPTF-TV and WRAL-TV, both Raleigh
stations, collapsed Sunday within a half hour of each other, said
spokesmen at the stations said. The towers stand side-by-side in
Auburn, a community south of Raleigh.
   Witnesses said it appeared melting ice destabilized the
2,000-foot structures. The stations estimated damage to the two
towers at $12 million and said it could be weeks before they would
be broadcasting at full power.
   ``I heard something. It sounded like ice,'' said Sue Williams, a
resident who lives near the towers. ``I saw it folding up just like
an accordion or folding ladder.''
   Adjacent to the towers, a third tower was left leaning to one
side under the weight of the ice.
   The storm blew in Friday, dumping several inches of snow in the
state's northern mountains, and began crawling across the state,
spitting sleet and glazing roads with ice.
   North Carolina Power spokesman Randy Shillingburg said it was
one of the most severe storms the utility has had in recent years.
About 8,500 of the utility's 90,000 customers remained without
electricity this morning, he said.
   Duke Power Co. said 10,000 Charlotte-area customers were without
power at some point during the storm, but service was substantially
back to normal today.
   The storm stranded travelers, both by air and car. Roads in the
Raleigh area Sunday morning where littered with abandoned cars.
Many flights were delayed and some were canceled at Raleigh-Durham
International Airport. on Saturday as airport officials
intermittently closed ice-slickened runways.
   Sunday evening, Lewis William Myers was killed in a
three-vehicle accident on Interstate 70 in Iredell County in the
western part of the state. Four other people died in separate icy
wrecks on Saturday, while three people were killed in
weather-related wrecks Friday.

<HEAD>KBI Director Dave Johnson Resigns in Aftermath of Joke Report</HEAD>

   The director of the Kansas Bureau of
Investigation has resigned in the face of criticism over a
newspaper report that he told a racist joke in the presence of two
Statehouse reporters.
   Dave Johnson announced Saturday he was leaving his job after
almost 2{ years, the same day a column about the joke appeared in
the Kansas City Times.
   Within hours of the column's publication, 22 legislators signed
letters expressing anger to Attorney General Robert Stephan, and
the chairwoman of the state Republican Party was preparing to call
for Johnson's resignation.
   In the column, reporter Ted Frederickson wrote that Johnson told
a joke that referred to a ``nigger.'' Frederickson is an associate
professor of journalism at the University of Kansas who worked for
the Times this fall.
   In his letter of resignation, Johnson acknowleged making the
joke, but said Frederickson took it out of context.
   ``I am sure you are aware that my performance has not indicated
that I am a racist,'' Johnson said in his letter.
   The legislators who condemned Johnson's conduct did not call for
his resignation, though they did suggest that Stephan discipline
him. Twenty-one legislators signed a letter to Stephan drafted by
state Rep. Sheila Hochhauser. Rep. Sherman Jones, one of four black
legislators, drafted another letter.
   Frederickson said Johnson told the joke last week, when
questioned by him and another reporter about a triple murder in
Topeka for which two teen-agers, one black and one white, were
arrested.
   The second reporter, Associated Press Correspondent Lew
Ferguson, said he initially did not report the joke because it was
not made in a public forum, but wrote a story Saturday when he
learned of legislators' reactions to Frederickson's column.
   Johnson, 59, became KBI director in July 1987, replacing
retiring director Thomas E. Kelly. Johnson had been an investigator
for the state Insurance Department for three years before taking
the position. He had retired as a KBI agent in 1984.

   The captain of the USS Iowa said today that he
inherited command of a battleship fraught with problems, but that
he could not endorse the singling out of a troubled gunner's mate
for setting off the explosion that killed 47 crewmen last spring.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally also told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that allegations of poor training and lack of
qualifications leveled against his crew imediately after the
explosion April 19 were unwarranted.
   He said he had no information to dispute the Navy's conclusion
that the blast was ``a wrongful, intentional act.'' But he said he
could not conclude that a single individual was responsible.
   The Navy concluded that a depressed Gunner's Mate Clayton
Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type
of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch
guns.
   Navy officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial
because all the witnesses, including Hartwig, were killed in the
blast.
   ``I don't think I could definitely say an individual did it,''
Moosally said today.
   The Navy's report on the explosion acknowledged deficiencies in
the way Iowa sailors were supposed to be certified to carry out
their jobs aboard ship, but it said these problems did not cause
the blast.
   In the weeks immediately after the blast, Moosally told
investigators that he was concerned about the quality of the
personnel aboard his ship.
   He complained that the sailors assigned to the Iowa were
``dopers, marginal performers, constant UA (unauthorized
absences),'' according to published accounts of his testimony to
Navy investigastors.
   He has since said he regreted his harsh remarks about his crews,
which he said amounted to an emotional outburst after the tragedy.
   Asked today about those comments, Moosally told senators:
   ``You have before you a paradox, a tale of two ships. One ship
you read about in the newspapers is a ship of laid-back attitudes,
failure and ineptitude. The other Iowa is the Iowa that I command:
well-trained, well-maintained and professional.''
   Moosally said that when he assumed command of the Iowa in May
1988, the ship was fraught with problems, including absenteeism and
drug abuse.
   But in 19 months the Iowa had become one of the finest ships in
the Navy, and when the explosion ripped through gun turret No. 2,
it was ``both a tragedy and the birth of 100 heroes,'' he said.
   Moosally said the Navy inquiry into the blast was ``generally
speaking'' fair.
   The captain said he disagreed with some of the charges of
shipboard deficiencies. But when asked if he was aware of any
information that would contradict the service's overall
conclusions, he said initially, ``Not that I am aware of.''
   Shortly after the Iowa returned home to Norfolk, Va., last
Thursday, Moosally also told reporters he believes the Navy's
report on the explosion closes the book on the matter.
   But skeptical lawmakers do not see it the same way.
   ``We want a resolution to the problems. We want to get to the
bottom of it once and for all,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass., chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on
investigations.
   That panel has scheduled hearings on the Iowa explosion on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Among the witnesses scheduled to appear under oath before
Mavroules' subcommittee are Moosally; Rear Adm. Richard Milligan,
who oversaw the technical and criminal study; and Kendall Truitt, a
sailor on the ship when an explosion ripped through the lowest
level of the No. 2 gun turret.
   Several analysts from the FBI and the Naval Investigative
Service as well as outside experts will be questioned.
   In announcing his committee's hearings, Mavroules said the panel
has been reviewing ``several aspects of the Navy investigation _
especially its technical competence and psychological analysis.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat expressed concern about a ``question
of interpretation'' of the evidence.
   In October, Mavroules said he ``seriously questioned'' the
Navy's report, and cited an FBI report that said its laboratory
investigation on the incident was inconclusive.
   ``We didn't find anything that would lead us to conclude that a
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge,'' the FBI said
in October. ``That's not to say something wasn't there. Our
findings were inconclusive.''
   In a Nov. 21 memorandum to members of the subcommittee,
Mavroules questioned why the report was described as inconclusive.
   ``I do not see it that way. It clearly says they did not find
elements that the Navy technicians said they found. Why is there
this discrepancy?'' he wrote.
   Mavroules also criticized the use of the FBI psychological
profile of the sailors which ``was intended to produce leads;
instead, it was used as a key document supporting the
investigation.''
   Despite the skepticism, the Navy defended its findings in
testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last month.
   Milligan said additional technical tests conducted since he
issued his report found ``unique foreign material'' on the
projectile from the exploding gun barrel that would not have been
present during a normal firing.
   The new tests identified the material as iron wires coated with
calcium, chlorine and oxygen, which would be produced by ``some
types of non-electronic explosive devices,'' Milligan said.

   An overcrowded bus and a truck

injuring 20 others, a newspaper reported Monday.
   A stalled car on the road apparently prevented the two drivers
from seeing each other as they approached from opposite directions
Saturday in the town of Tanjungan, about 115 miles northwest of
Jakarta, the newspaper Pelita said.

   Snow and low temperatures combined to make the Rockies' roads
slick early today, causing numerous road pile-ups. Elsewhere, snow
fell in much of the Midwest, and wind-chills far below zero numbed
parts of the Dakotas.
   A winter storm warning was posted for locally heavy snow along
with gusty winds and low temperatures in a portion of Colorado
including the southern foothills and the Sangre de Cristo mountains.
   In northern Utah, slippery roads were blamed for accidents
involving more than 20 cars near Salt Lake International Airport on
Sunday night. Numerous minor injuries were reported.
   Most of Colorado east of the Continental Divide was hard hit by
the storm, which left a slew of motor vehicle accidents in its wake
Sunday, including a 20-car pileup on Interstate 25 near Johnstown
that closed the highway for two hours. Three people suffered minor
injuries in that accident.
   Much of the country's northern tier, the northern Rockies and
Iowa and Nebraska registered temperatures in the single digits this
morning. Wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero were reported
in North Dakota.
   Snow was reported early today from Denver to Albany, N.Y. Cities
blanketed with snow included St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago
and North Platte, Neb.
   The cold reached down into the panhandle of Texas, where snow
was possible today. A winter storm watch for snow and freezing rain
also was forecast for tonight and Tuesday over northern Mississippi.
   Out West, high winds were expected today across Southern
California, where gusts up to 70 mph were possible in the mountains.
   In North Carolina, the first wintry storm of the season was
blamed for the deaths of eight motorists. The storm knocked out
power to thousands of households and toppled two television towers
before moving out to sea Sunday.
   Towers for WPTF-TV and WRAL-TV, both Raleigh stations, collapsed
Sunday within a half-hour of each other, spokesmen for the stations
said. The towers stand side-by-side in Auburn just south of Raleigh.
   The entire nation, however, wasn't under a wintry grip.
   In El Paso, Texas, the temperature reached 73 degrees Sunday,
breaking the record for the date. The nation's high Sunday was 83
degrees at San Angelo, Texas.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today expressed ``favorable
interest'' in a Western plan to boost the international role of
Berlin, according to a statement from the World War II Allies after
a meeting in West Berlin.
   The statement was distributed at the end of a 2{-hour conference
of the ambassadors of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain
and France. It was the first such meeting here since 1971.
   Earlier, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted German
reunification will come one day but acknowledged such a step
remains a ``vision.''
   The meeting was held at Allied headquarters in West Berlin, 100
miles inside East German territory. At the 1971 meeting, an
agreement was drawn up establishing the rights of the four
countries in the city, which has been divided into four sectors
since World War II.
   ``The Western ambassadors set out their proposals under the
Berlin initiative. The Soviet ambassador expressed favorable
interest,'' the Allies' statement said.
   The initiative, outlined by then-President Reagan in 1987, calls
for improving air traffic to Berlin, making the city the site of
youth exchanges and international conferences. It also calls for
holding the Olympic Games in the city in the future.
   ``During the meeting there was a common understanding of the
importance of stability, and confidence was expressed that the
United States, United Kingdom, France and Soviet Union could
contribute to that on the basis of the quadripartite agreement of
1971,'' the statement said. It added that further meetings may take
place.
   Those attending the meeting, Vernon Walters, Christopher Mallaby
and Serge Boidevaix _ the U.S., British and French ambassadors to
West Germany _ and Vyacheslav Kochemasov, the Soviet ambassador to
East Germany, made no comment to reporters.
   Kohl, attending a meeting of his Christian Democratic party in
West Berlin, said: ``We do not know when the day will come when
this vision (of reunification) will become reality, but I am
convinced that it will come.''
   The West German chancellor was due to meet U.S. Secretary of
States James A. Baker III on Tuesday. The meeting had been planned
for Bonn, but U.S. officials said the two would meet in West
Berlin. Baker was flying to Berlin later in the day.
   At the last Four Power conference in 1971, the Soviets agreed to
allow unhindered air, rail and automobile traffic between West
Germany and West Berlin. The agreement also cleared the way for
closer ties between West Germany and West Berlin.
   Berlin has been in a turmoil since the Communists who led East
Germany for all its 40 years bowed to massive public pressure and
decided Nov. 9 to allow free travel to the West.
   The Berlin Wall and East Germany's other borders, closed since
1961 to end mass defections, were suddenly open.
   In the month that followed, peaceful popular revolutions have
ousted old Communist regimes from power in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia, with free elections promised next year.
   Kohl has proposed a confederation with East Germany that would
lead to eventual reunification of the two Germanys. East Germany's
leaders have resisted calls for unity but say they back close
cooperation with Bonn.
   In the tumult, the Four Powers have been largely ignored.
   At least on paper, the three Western Allies have final say in
many significant issues concerning West Berlin.
   Many West Berliners want that to change, and the leaders of the
West German city-state have called for a revision of its status.

   Representatives from Hong Kong and China met
Monday for the first time since Beijing crushed internal dissent in
June, and they agreed the British colony should not serve as a base
for subversion against China after 1997, press reports said.
   Meeting in the southern Chinese city of Canton, the committee
that is drafting the Basic Law, or constitution, for Hong Kong
after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997 Hong Kong, accepted the
proposal after a heated debate, the reports said.
   The Basic Law is supposed to ensure that Hong Kong can maintain
its capitalistic system for at least 50 years after 1997 and enjoy
a ``high degree of autonomy,'' as promised by China in negotiations
on the territory's reversion.
   China recently has attacked its critics in Hong Kong, who have
condemned the June 3-4 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people.
   Li Hou, a top Chinese official involved in drafting the Basic
Law, said last month that China was considering prohibiting
contacts with overseas political groups.
   The Basic Law drafting committee, made up of more than 50
Chinese and Hong Kong members, began its deliberations 2{ years
ago. The final draft law is to be put to a vote in March at a full
session of China's legislature.

   Three Hungarian journalists who went to
Romania last week to meet a dissident clergyman were detained by
police, expelled from the country and banned from re-entering for
five years, it was reported Monday.
   Police also confiscated their film and video cassettes.
   Szilvia Izso, a reporter for Nepszabadsag, the official
newspaper of the ruling Socialist Party, and two other reporters of
a regional newspaper went to Romania on Thursday to interview
Protestant clergyman Laszlo Toekes, who has been harassed for his
criticism of human rights violations in Romania.
   Last month, Toekes and his pregnant wife moved into a boarded-up
church in Timisoara, in western Romania, after ``hooligans,''
believed to be members of the secret police, broke the windows in
their home repeatedly and threatened them.
   The journalists said that as they were being detained, they saw
Toekes being escorted out of the church by three police officials.
They said they did not know what happened to him.

<HEAD>A Revival of `The Tenth Man' Opens at Lincoln Center</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds four grafs with what other critics said. No pickup. No
PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paddy Chayefsky's ``The Tenth Man,'' revived
Sunday at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, is a savvy
mixture of Borscht Belt humor, religious mysticism and
old-fashioned melodrama.
   For much of its three acts, this fine comedy-drama is what used
to be called ``a well-made play,'' those expertly constructed
entertainments that flourished on Broadway until about the
mid-1960s when theater economics skyrocketed and mass audiences
dwindled for serious drama.
   The story, set in 1959 _ the year the play was first presented
on Broadway _certainly is a sturdy one. A group of elderly Orthodox
Jews gather at a shabby storefront synagogue on Long Island for
morning prayers. But their meditations are interrupted by the
arrival of Foreman, a member of the congregation, who has in tow
his granddaughter. She's a mentally disturbed young woman he
believes is possessed by an evil spirit called a dybbuk.
   If the plot sounds familiar, it is. Chayefsky's play is a
variation on ``The Dybbuk,'' S. Ansky's drama which has been a
staple of Yiddish theaters in this country since the 1920s.
   Is the girl possessed or merely insane? Chayefsky shrewly keeps
the audience guessinfare for those who like their holiday plays to go on
as
long as Hanukkah. ... In its eagerness to pander, ``The Tenth Man''
seems as cynical now as the television programming that Chayefsky
would later attack in his screenplay for ``Network.''
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: The evening has moments of power but
lacks the mystery and tension to make the arrival of the title
character more than merely funny. The overall feeling is closer to
the amiable Leo Rosten than, say, the demonic Isaac Bashevis Singer.
   Linda Winer, Newsday: The play manages to be both quaint and
vital, neatly old-fashioned and modern, a curiosity, yes, but one
that is loaded with the ornary wit, verbal richness and oversized
heart that characterized his (Chayefsky's) most enjoyable work.

   El Salvador may resume diplomatic
relations with Nicaragua under overall proposals at a Central
American summit here seeking greater involvement by the United
Nations in settling the two countries' guerrilla wars, a Salvadoran
spokesman said today.
   Oscar Santamaria, the Salvadoran justice minister, told The
Associated Press in an interview he is optimistic about the outcome
of the two-day summit by the region's five presidents scheduled to
end tonight.
   ``Last night we clarified various positions and, if everything
goes on like this, it is possible that at the end of the meeting we
may announce the normalization of relations with Nicaragua,'' said
Santamaria, a member of his country's delegation.
   Santamaria said the presidents, in principle, agreed to issue a
statement condemning leftist guerrilla attacks in El Salvador,
which was part of an all-out offensive the rebels launched Nov. 11.
   But he said the statement would not use the term ``terrorist''
in condmenning the rebels, apparently at the request of Nicaragua's
President Daniel Ortega. But Santamaria refused to go into details,
other than indicate all five countries are seeking greater U.N.
involvment to settle the two wars.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani suspended diplomatic
relations with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government Nov. 26,
one day after two planes that crashed in El Salvador were found to
have been carrying Soviet surface-to-air missiles for the rebels.
   Meanwhile, Ortega is seeking agreement to allow U.N. observers
more power and personnel to start disbanding the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels, a source said.
   For its part, El Salvador rejected a cease-fire proposal by the
leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
whose offensive was the largest of the decade-old civil war.
   Under the Nicaraguan plan, the government would consider
resuming its cease-fire and ``technical talks'' with the leadership
of the Honduras-based rebels after the Contra force is disbanded,
the Nicaraguan source said on condition of anonymity.
   ``The demobilization of the Contras must be complied with,''
said Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel D'Escoto, referring to an
Aug. 7 regional peace agreement under which the guerrillas were to
have been disbanded last week. ``The United Nations must begin to
function in Nicaragua.''
   The source said Nicaragua was not optimistic about getting
Contra camps in Honduras dismantled because Washington wants to
keep the Contras alive to ensure Nicaragua's Feb. 25 presidential
elections are free and clean.
   Nicaragua's government insists the presidents follow through on
their agreement that the Contras be demobilized.
   A U.N. observer group has been sent to the region to verify the
Contra repatriation and to make sure no weapons are sent from one
country in the region to another's insurgents.
   The Salvadoran rebel cease-fire proposal was presented by
Nicaragua and rejected by the Salvadoran government, which had
offered a possible resumption of talks with the rebels if they stop
guerrilla activities in cities.
   The Salvadoran guerrillas also asked for the dismissal of seven
high-ranking military leaders in El Salvador and ``full respect for
human rights and democratic liberties of political and social
organizations.''
   At the same time, Costa Rica proposed a truce in El Salvador
from Tuesday through Jan. 15 to give both sides in El Salvador time
to begin negotiations for a permanent cease-fire. Costa Rica also
proposed that the United Nations be given powers to verify the
proposed truce.
   The five presidents are meeting for the sixth time in 28 months
in their search for a peaceful solution to regional conflicts. They
are Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador,
Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and Oscar
Arias of Costa Rica.
   Frustration and pessimism prevailed as the summit took place
amid what Arias called ``the most difficult moment'' since the
peace negotiations began.
   El Salvador accuses Nicaragua of sending missiles to the
Salvadoran rebels, while Nicaragua accuses El Salvador and Honduras
of siding with the United States and helping the Contras.
   The role of the United States and that of the Soviet Union were
also brought up at the meeting.
   Costa Rica's foreign minister, Rodrigo Madrigal, acknowledged
that regional agreements will not have much validity if the
superpowers do not support peace and the conflicting parties have
close ties to them.
   Arias, who created the region's original peace plan, on Saturday
called the United States and Soviet Union ``two-faced'' and accused
them of speaking about peaceful solutions while encouraging
military activities.
   The United States provides aid to the Contras and the government
of El Salvador in its fight against leftist rebels backed by
Nicaragua and, at least indirectly, by the Soviet Union.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The four World War II Allies still have final
say over Berlin, although most of the day-to-day administration has
been turned over to German authorities.
   Berlin, the former Nazi capital, was conquered in the last few
days of World War II by Soviet troops.
   According to previously made agreements, the city was put under
the joint administration of the four victorious powers _ the United
States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain _ and each occupied a
sector of Berlin. The city itself was inside the overall Soviet
occupation zone.
   As the East-West relations worsened, the four-power
administration of Berlin became more and more impractical.
   In June 1948, the Soviets blockaded the Western sector to try to
push the Western powers out of Berlin, which was a Western enclave
inside the Soviet occupation zone. The U.S.-led Berlin airlift kept
about 2 million people in West Berlin from starving and the Soviets
lifted the blockade in May 1949.
   When East Germany was founded in 1949, East Berlin was
proclaimed its capital, although that violated previous agreements
that stipulated that Berlin would belong to none of the occupation
zones and that it would retain a special status. This special
status is still in force, although the Soviets have put virtually
all control in local hands.
   When West Germany's consitution called West Berlin a state
within the Federal Republic, the Western Allies complained it
violated the four-power status. The Allies also emphasized they
retained supreme authority over the Western sector, but they
allowed West Berlin's integration into the legal, economic, fiscal,
monetary and social system of West Germany.
   Although East Germany and the Soviet Union tolerated this
situation for years, after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961,
the Communists started obstructing traffic between West Germany and
West Berlin.
   In March 1970, the four powers began negotiating over Berlin,
recognizing that there could be no relaxation of tensions in Europe
without an agreement over the divided city.
   The Four Power Agreement, or the Quadripartite Agreement, was
signed on Sept. 3, 1971, and contains practical steps to improve
West Berlin's situation.
   The Soviets no longer disputed the Western presence in West
Berlin, and have accepted its ties to West Germany, including
Bonn's right to represent West Berlin internationally.
   The 1971 agreement also secured and vastly improved West
Berlin's land, rail and waterway links to West Germany. West
Berliners were permitted again to visit East Berlin and East
Germany and telephone links between the two sides were restored.
   But the treaty did not change Berlin's special legal status and
the city remains technically under the four powers' government.
West Berlin technically is not part of West Germany and is not
governed directly from Bonn. Federal laws are applied in West
Berlin under a special procedure.
   The Allies, for instance, still control air traffic to West
Berlin, and only U.S., French and British airlines are allowed to
maintain regular service between West Berlin and the outside world.

<HEAD>Japan Keeping Ban on High-Level Contacts With China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will continue avoiding high-level contacts
with China in the wake of the June killing of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing, the government's top spokeswoman said
Monday.
   Japan will watch developments in China cautiously while
maintaining its freeze on massive loans to the Communist
government, Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama said after
talks between Japanese leaders and U.S. National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft.
   Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
arrived in Japan on Sunday after a surprise visit to Beijing for
the first Sino-U.S. talks between senior officials since Washington
barred such contacts after the military crackdown on student-led
protests in Beijing June 3-4.
   The major Western democracies agreed at their annual summit in
France in July to stop all high-level contacts with China and
suspend new credit to protest the crackdown, in which hundreds and
possibly thousands of people were killed.
   Scowcroft's visit has drawn criticism in the United States,
where Chinese dissidents and some members of Congress deplored
President Bush's decision to resume high-level contacts without
improvements in human rights in China.
   ``The White House explained to us that this was an exception,
and we accept it as such,'' Mrs. Moriyama said. ``I don't think the
basic U.S. position has changed.''
   Japan was informed in advance of Scowcroft's visit to China,
Mrs. Moriyama said. The Bush administration did not announce the
trip until Scowcroft and Eagleburger arrived in Beijing, where they
briefed Chinese leaders on the U.S.-Soviet summit and discussed
bilateral relations.
   The two met Sunday night with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu and stressed the importance of U.S.-Japan cooperation in
relations with China.
   Kaifu said he hoped China would not be isolated from the rest of
the world, but Mrs. Moriyama said Monday that Japan will maintain
its freeze on $5.66 billion in loans imposed following the
crackdown. Japanese officials have said there is no timetable for
resuming discussions on the loans, originally to have been provided
between 1990 and 1995.
   Japan also has no plans to send a special envoy of its own to
the Chinese capital, Mrs. Moriyama said.
   Japanese business in China has become sluggish, with tourism and
investment plummeting. Work on at least one major construction
project in Beijing funded by Japan has been abandoned.
   The chill in Sino-Japanese relations ``is not desirable from the
viewpoint of peace and stability in Asia and both countries should
exert efforts toward their improvement,'' Japanese Foreign Minister
Taro Nakayama told Scowcroft and Eagleburger Monday.
   Nakayama was quoted by Japan's Kyodo News Service as praising
the decision to send the two U.S. envoys to Beijing.

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and thousands of
others at Notre Dame cathedral today mourned the 14 women killed by
a gunman last week, and listened to appeals that their deaths help
build a better world.
   ``We have the tools in our hand to build a better world, a world
of peace,'' said Alain Perreault, president of the students'
association at the University of Montreal engineering school.
   He spoke of the victims' dreams and hopes and urged, ``Let's
achieve these great things ... of hope, of understanding.''
   Schools and universities throughout Quebec province observed a
minute of silence as the joint funeral Mass for nine of the victims
started. Families of five of the victims of Canada's worst mass
murder chose private services.
   Nearly 4,000 dignitaries including Mulroney and his wife, Mila,
students from the engineering school and families of the victims
filled the cathedral in Montreal's historic center.
   A gunman identified by police as Marc Lepine, 25, killed the
women in a rampage through three of the engineering school's six
floors on Wednesday before turning his semiautomatic assault rifle
on himself.
   Despite temperatures below freezing, several thousand people
listened quietly outside the cathedral to the 80-minute service
broadcast on loudspeakers.
   Cardinal Paul Gregoire, the city's Roman Catholic archbishop,
said in his homily that the women were ``brutally mowed down in the
beauty of their youth at a time when everything seemed to assure
them of a brilliant future.''
   He urged that, with the influence of their deaths, ``We should
seek to build a world of solidarity, a world of friendship.''
   The funeral followed a day when more than 7,000 people paid
final respects to the victims, eight of whose white, flower-draped
coffins lay in state at the university's hall of honor.
   ``We're sort of helpless in a way, but you feel you have to do
something,'' said Jennifer Jonas, an artist waiting in line with a
small floral bouquet.
   The gunman burst into the university's engineering school late
Wednesday afternoon on the last day of classes, shouting ``I want
the women!'' and ``You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate
feminists!''
   A suicide letter showed he carried a special grudge against
feminists, police said.
   Thirteen of those who died were students; the other was a school
employee. All were between the ages of 21 and 31. The gunman also
wounded nine women and four men. Their condition was reported today
to be improving.
   The engineering school started psychological counseling for
students and the victims' families and postponed exams until
Wednesday.
   Documents obtained by the Montreal Gazette of the divorce of
Lepine's parents, which occurred when he was seven, showed that his
mother said his father beat her, the boy and his sister.
   The father believed ``women are not men's equals and that women
are servants to men,'' the mother, Monique Lepine, said at the 1976
hearing.
   The father, Rachid Liass Gharbi, denied the allegations. Lepine
was named Gamil Gharbi but took his mother's name when he was 18.
   Today's service was for Maria Klueznick, 31; Genevieve Bergeron,
21; Helene Colgan, 23; Nathalie Croteau, 23; Barbara Daigneault,
22; Anne-Marie Edward, 21; Maud Haviernick, 29; Maryse Leclair, 23;
and Annie St-Arneault, 23.
   Private funerals have been arranged for Michele Richard, 21,
Maryse Laganiere, 25, Anne-Marie Lemay, 22, Sonia Pelletier, 28,
and Annie Turcotte, 21.

<HEAD>Honor to Revolutionary Priest Revives Old Grievances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of a revolutionary priest are to be
enshrined Tuesday in the hallowed Pantheon in a bicentennial
ceremony that has revived 200-year-old grievances of the Roman
Catholic church against the French Revolution.
   Church leaders are boycotting the event, the last planned in a
bicentennial year in which the archbishop of Paris says ``we were
invited to commemorate a period when the church was violently
persecuted.''
   Henri Gregoire, better known as the Abbe Gregoire, fought
slavery, proposed the abolition of the monarchy and backed a
controversial oath of allegiance to the state that clergy were
forced to take.
   To close out a year of bicentennial parades, exhibits and
fireworks, President Francois Mitterrand decided to honor the Abbe
Gregoire and two other revolutionary figures: the philosopher
Condorcet and the mathematician Gaspard Monge.
   A solemn ceremony is planned Tuesday evening for the placing of
their remains in the Pantheon, a disaffected church in the form of
a classical temple on the Left Bank where the French Republic
honors its heroes.
   France's Roman Catholic hierarchy decided not to send any
representatives, although papal nuncio Lorenzo Antonetti will
represent Pope John Paul II at the ceremony.
   The church in France, while no longer the anti-republican force
it once was, has not forgotten the revolution's massacres of clergy
and violent desecration of churches.
   The Abbe Gregoire was a central figure in the drama that split
the revolution and the church: the 1790 Civil Constitution of the
Clergy, which required the clergy to swear allegiance to the state.
Many resisted, maintaining their loyalty to the pope, and relations
rapidly deteriorated.
   ``The Abbe Gregoire defended a conception of the church which
differs from the Catholic tradition,'' Cardinal Jean-Marie
Lustiger, the archbishop of Paris, was quoted as saying in an
interview in Le Monde in which he explained the decision not to
attend the ceremony.
   But Lustiger said he would preside at an Office for the Dead to
mark the Abbe Gregoire's exhumation from Montparnasse Cemetery,
even though his predecessor as archbishop of Paris refused to
authorize a church funeral when Gregoire died in 1831.
   The papal nuncio's presence ``confirms the desire of the Holy
See to help France and French Catholics heal the wounds which may
remain from the revolutionary crisis and the anti-religious
violence early in this century,'' Lustiger was quoted as saying.
   Lustiger said he considered it worthwhile to honor the Abbe
Gregoire ``because of his struggle for the emancipation of the
Jews, for the rights of blacks and the abolition of slavery.''
   But he also said the French bishops had tried to maintain their
proper role ``with dignity'' throughout the bicentennial
celebrations ``in which we were invited to commemorate a period
when the church was violently persecuted.''
   The French hierarchy's decision not to participate in the
ceremony for the Abbe Gregoire has been questioned discreetly by
other church leaders.
   ``The absence of bishops at the Pantheon will surprise a certain
number of Christians. I understand that reaction,'' said Monsignor
Jacques Delaporte, the bishop of Cambrai.
   The others being honored Tuesday are less controversial.
   Jean-Antoine Caritat, marquis de Condorcet, a friend of Voltaire
and other ``philosophes,'' opposed the death penalty and favored
equal rights for women. During the Jacobin purge of the Girondins
he was arrested and died in prison in March 1794. In his case, the
transfer of remains is symbolic; his body was thrown in a common
grave and never recovered.
   Gaspard Monge, the inventor of descriptive geometry, served on
the revolutionary committee that developed the metric system. He
gave courses in manufacture of cannons and powder for the defense
of the young republic, and later was close to Napoleon, losing all
his honors when Napoleon fell in 1814.

   Henry Sudduth's life started off bad and
got worse, but the pudgy, white-bearded, balding man said without
those experiences he couldn't do what he does best _ be Santa Claus.
   Sudduth was an abused child and spent time in an outlaw
motorcycle gang before a stint in the Marines and marriage helped
turn his life around. He's spent the last 14 years as ``Madison's
Santa Claus,'' refurbishing and distributing toys to needy children.
   ``The kids let me into their lives every day,'' he said. ``They
can relate to me. I know what they're going through. I have not
been Mr. Lily White, but every bit of it gave me a deep knowledge
of children I'll never forget.''
   The 55-year-old Sudduth, who also works as an apartment manager,
works year-round with a group of volunteer elves to collect and
repair old toys in his workshop and distribute them to needy
children.
   Although he never stops being Santa, the holidays _ obviously _
are his busiest time of year.
   ``When Christmas comes, I lose track of everything,'' he said.
   But Sudduth, who doesn't need pillows or a false beard to look
like Santa, said this Christmas holds special meaning.
   ``I'm just thankful to be alive,'' he said, his eyes squinting
and his red, round cheeks jiggling with each giggle. ``And I'm
thankful for all these fantastic people in this town. They blew me
away when I was in the hospital.''
   Sudduth suffered a brain aneurysm in November 1988 that left him
in the hospital for three weeks and required surgery.
   When residents discovered Sudduth did not have health insurance
they started a ``Get Well Santa'' fund and raised more than $41,000.
   ``The people came through for someone in need, just like he does
every day for people in need,'' said Don Dahnke, owner of Don's
Hallmark, who donated space for Santa's workshop.
   Dahnke said his suppliers of toys, stuffed animals and candy
used to think he was joking when he told them about Sudduth and
asked for donations but ``they don't think it's a joke anymore.''
   Sudduth's network of thousands of volunteers reaches across
Wisconsin and throughout the nation, but even if he had no help, he
would still be giving, friends said.
   ``I know he's gone down to $2 in his checkbook to make sure
people would have a Christmas dinner,'' Dahnke said.
   Sudduth refuses to accept money for being Santa, saying ``you
can't give to those who give.''
   He used to hang uncashed checks on his walls and he has a frame
of them in his crowded workshop, including a blank one made out to
``Mr. S. Claus.''
   Sudduth drives a 1972 Dodge with a holiday-style paint job and
hugs everyone he meets _ something he hasn't always done.
   ``I was a very abused child,'' he said, with his usually jolly
voice turning solemn. ``I equated that violence with love, and I
thought I was spreading that love with violence.''
   Sudduth, whose mother died of cancer when he was 14, said he
spent time in California as the president of a motorcycle gang
before moving to the Midwest.
   ``I went there looking for brotherhood and love,'' he said.
``But it wasn't there. It's not anywhere but in your heart. I
didn't know that then, but I do now.''
   Sudduth's wife, Kathy, has long, wavy hair parted in the middle,
wears round, metal-framed glasses and is often called ``Mrs.
Claus.'' Mr. Claus says she turned his life around.
   Sudduth did not choose his first Santa assignment 32 years ago;
he was drafted. He was a Marine staff sergeant and was pulled out
of his barracks to play Santa ``because they needed someone fat.''

<HEAD>Former Interior Minister Extradited to Miami to Face Drug Charges</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with 5 grafs at end to ADD background and comment from
Washington official; no pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Interior Minister Luis Arce Gomez
was flown to Miami today to face U.S. drug trafficking charges.
   Arce Gomez has been accused of leading a cocaine trafficking
operation while he was Bolivia's top law enforcement official. He
also hired Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie to advise his
paramilitary forces that tortured and killed opposition political
and labor figures.
   A U.S. indictment in Miami charges that Bolivian secret police
under his control seized cocaine from traffickers who failed to pay
for protection, and delivered it to smugglers who did pay.
   Two of his lieutenants charged in the indictment once received
$1.5 million for cocaine that was confiscated by Bolivian
authorities and stored in bank vaults, according to the indictment.
   The indictment says Arce Gomez personally ordered it released.
   ``He was indicted along with 18 other individuals and charged
with various violations of the criminal drug laws of the United
States,'' said U.S. Attorney's spokeswoman Diane Cossin in Miami.
   ``Specifically, the charges involved conspiracies related to the
importation, distribution and intent to distribute narcotics,'' she
said.
   A Bush administration source in Washington said of the
extradition, ``It's happening,'' but refused to give any details.
   Arce Gomez had a reputation for ruthlessnes and for personally
torturing political prisoners. He was named interior minister in
1980 and rounded up hundreds of journalists, political and labor
leaders and church officials.
   He was removed from his post in 1981 under pressure from the
U.S. government.
   Arce Gomez flew to Argentina in 1982 and was arrested under the
Miami indictment. However, he was freed in December 1983 by the
outgoing military regime just before Argentine President Raul
Alfonsin took office.
   His whereabouts were unknown until his capture Sunday at a ranch
near the city of Santa Cruz, 350 miles east of La Paz. He offered
no resistance when hundreds of police officers converged on the
ranch.

   The patient getting her tubes tied on the
operating table was pulled from a trap near the South Platte River
that morning. Poking out from under the surgical cloth was her flat
paddle of a tail.
   At the other end, beneath the anesthesia mask, stuck two, 2-inch
orange incisors. It took veterinarian David Robinson an hour of
donated time to give the 48-pound beaver a tubal ligation and
hysterectomy.
   Her mate then was carried in for a vasectomy.
   ``If you don't plan for wildlife in urban areas it becomes a
nuisance,'' says wildlife activist Sherry Tippie, who initiated the
sterilization program in response to what city officials say is a
gnawing problem _ the rodents' appetite for city trees.
   To make a dent in their numbers, several beavers were caught and
given contraceptive surgery under the experimental program run by
the Colorado Division of Wildlife, the University of Northern
Colorado and the citizens' group Wildlife 2000, which Tippie heads.
   If caught, a dozen more beavers will get the same treatment, and
some will get contraceptive implants that release anti-fertility
hormones over time.
   It's one of the first times contraception has been tried in
urban-wildlife management, organizers say.
   The large rodents live among the factories, railyards and
highways along the South Platte River. Strollers and cyclists along
a bike trail there were stunned to see program volunteers hoist the
caged beavers _ one as heavy as 60 pounds _ out of the water.
   But along the water's edge are piles of branches and sticks
beavers build as lodges and food caches, and also the occasional
conical stump with tell-tale tooth marks.
   Beavers caused an estimated $100,000 damage to trees along
Denver's rivers and creeks last year, said city parks spokeswoman
Amy Pulver.
   ``Having urban wildlife is an amenity. People go to see it,
children can learn from it,'' she said. ``But trees are an amenity
too. We're trying to find a balance.''
   An ordinance passed several years ago outlaws trapping as too
dangerous, and besides, says Tippie, ``The general public doesn't
want animals killed.''
   Her answer: a combination of relocation and family planning.
   The animals, whose valuable pelts lured some of the first whites
to Colorado, were virtually annihilated last century to satisfy
demand in eastern and European cities for beaver hats.
   In recent decades, the beaver population along the South Platte
and its tributaries has rebounded, turning the waterways into
``beaver highways,'' said Mark Lamb of the state widlife division.
He estimates that within Denver alone there are about 75 beavers.
   Decades of development, however, reduced the scrubby vegetation
and cottonwood trees along the river. Sometimes those trees were
replaced with more expensive varieties.
   The beavers gnaw what they find.
   Tippie, who is ``nuts about beavers,'' offered to fix the city's
problem by fixing the beavers.
   This summer, she, Lamb and a handful of volunteers, including a
professional trapper, caught 46 beavers, from Evergreen in the
mountains west of Denver to just south of Greeley on the
northeastern plains.
   At a cost to Denver of $75 per beaver, they relocated them to
Rocky Mountain National Park, Fairplay, Glenwood Springs, and other
public and private sites where residents were interested in
reintroducing beavers.
   But relocation alone would not reduce Denver's beaver
population. If a pair is removed, another will take its place.
Beavers are monogamous and territorial and will keep the population
down on their own if they aren't moved, the two say.
   ``The whole idea of contraception is that males being very
territorial, once they're sterilized they will also prevent fertile
males from moving in. We're using wildlife to manage wildlife,''
says Tippie.
   The sterilization program costs the city nothing. Robinson
donates his time as a member of Wildlife 2000.
   He performs tubal ligations and vasectomies rather than
neutering the animals so they will continue to function as mates
and families, only unable to reproduce.
   Robinson puts a transmitter into each beaver's abdomen so that
Lamb can track their recovery and any subsequent migrations. The
division and UNC biology professor Jim Fitzgerald in Greeley will
monitor the program's effects on the South Platte's beaver
population.

   Eight hunger strikers who have occupied
the Cathedral of St. Paul since beginning a fast on Thanksgiving to
protest U.S. military aid to El Salvador said today they are ending
the fast.
   Striker Rene Hurtado said the fast was being called off in part
because of pleas from Gov. Rudy Perpich and other politicians, and
also to encourage others who did not want to take part in a hunger
strike to join their cause.
   ``By ending the hunger strike, we are allowing everybody to
participate with us in fighting to stop military aid to El
Salvador,'' he said.
   Their water-only fast began shortly after the murder of six
Jesuit priests in El Salvador last month. It was in its 19th day
today.
   Doctors had said the the strikers, who were ingesting nothing
but water, were entering a critical period that would greatly
stress their systems by causing vitamin deficiencies, mineral
imbalances and psychological strains.
   On Sunday, Perpich went to the church and asked the strikers to
suspend their fast until Congress acts on the issue. The governor
made the request after joining hands with the strikers in seeking
an end to military aid to the Central American country.
   On Friday, House Speaker Tom Foley called the hunger strikers to
urge them to end their strike and he promised that military aid to
El Salvador would be a major issue when Congress reconvenes next
month. U.S. Rep. Gerry Sikorski, a Democrat from Minnesota, also
urged for the strike to end.
   The hunger strikers included three refugees from El Salvador.
Another striker is from Guatemala, one from Bolivia and three from
the United States.
   Roman Catholic church officials have allowed the protesters to
stay in the cathedral during the strike, saying they could remain
as long as they didn't interrupt services.

   For 15 years, members of the ``Free Gary
Tyler'' movement across the nation have sung, marched, signed
petitions, and put their cause on T-shirts and bumper stickers.
This week they hope for results.
   Tyler, now 31, has served nearly half in his life in jail for a
murder his supporters say he didn't commit.
   The Louisiana Pardon Board is expected to announce Thursday its
recommendation to Gov. Buddy Roemer on whether Tyler should be set
free. The governor has final say.
   Petitions with more than 12,000 signatures have been sent to the
board and the governor by The Committee to Free Gary Tyler. Amnesty
International in London and West Germany wrote in support of Tyler,
said Mary Howell, his defense attorney.
   Tyler applied to the pardon board in 1980 but let the
application lapse while he pursued other appeals. An October
hearing was the first the board gas held in the case, and the
decision expected this week will be its first ruling.
   In October 1974, Tyler, a black, was in the midst of a heated
confrontation over the desegration of schools in Destrehan, a small
town about 25 miles north of New Orleans. He was 16.
   State police in riot gear were patrolling the streets of the
town, as were members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   David Duke, now a Republican state representative, was a young
Klan leader who promised to lead armed patrols of Klansmen into
town.
   ``We will help protect white people from rampaging black savages
and murders,'' Duke announced then.
   The situation came to a head when Destrehan High was closed
early because of a series of racial fights. Teachers tried to put
the 1,200 students onto school buses for the trip home.
   As whites surrounded buses of black students, shouting and
hurling bottles, cans and rocks, a shot was fired. Timothy Webber,
a 13-year-old white student standing with his mother across the
school yard, fell dead.
   An all-white jury sentenced Tyler to death for the shooting. The
sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when the U.S. Supreme
Court struck down the state's death penalty law.
   The conviction has withstood appeals, although a federal appeals
court at one time found enough evidence to say that Tyler was
prevented from getting a fundamentally fair trial.
   Tyler, who turned down a request for an interview on the advice
of his lawyer, always has maintained his innocence.
   His lawyer said he was a natural target for authorities.
   ``Gary Tyler was outspoken. He had what was called a smart
mouth,'' Howell told the state pardon board.
   Support for his cause from famous and ordinary citizens has
never stopped over the years. Hundreds ringed the state Supreme
Court chanting ``Free Gary Tyler'' during a 1976 appeal. Several
dozen, many of them wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan, sat
quietly at the November pardon board hearing.
   In 1976, protest marches and rallies were held in Detroit,
Pittsburgh, Boston, New York, Chicago and other cities.
   Pravda wrote about Tyler in 1978, calling him a ``political
prisoner.''
   The British reggae band UB40 recorded a song about Tyler.
   Howell said much of the money for Tyler's appeal has come from
the committee, which he and a core group of about a dozen workers
reactivated about two years ago.
   Several hundred T-shirts and buttons have been sold. In March, a
fund-raiser featured local musicians and poets. The Neville
Brothers headlined another money-raising concert in August.
   ``A terrible injustice has been done to Gary Tyler. It's our
duty to do everything within our power to set him free,'' said the
Rev. Avery Alexander, a state representative. ``The committee is as
committed as ever to doing that.''

   An Air Force Delta 2 propelled a
military navigation satellite into orbit today to join a network of
spacecraft which tell U.S. and allied military forces where they
are within 50 feet anywhere in the world.
   The 128-foot booster blazed away from its launch pad at 1:10
p.m. after being postponed one day because of a problem with a fuel
tank pressurization system. The problem was corrected overnight.
   ``A very smooth flight; the rocket is right on track,'' said Air
Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the launch commentator, as the Delta 2
climbed toward orbit.
   Twenty-five minutes after liftoff, Rand reported the satellite
had separated and was in a proper orbit ranging out to 11,000 miles
high. ``Everything appears to have gone very well with the
flight,'' he said.
   The payload is a $65 million Navstar satellite whose signals are
designed to guide military units such as planes, ships, submarines,
tanks and land forces with pinpoint accuracy.
   Four similar satellites, all launched from here earlier this
year, are orbiting Earth as part of a global navigation network.
   The military launch was given priority over another rocket whose
flight was postponed last week. In that case, the liftoff of a
commercial Titan 3 rocket carrying a pair of foreign communications
satellites was delayed Thursday night by a computer software
problem and again Friday by stormy weather.
   That launch, now rescheduled for Dec. 20, will be Martin
Marietta's first commercial one for paying customers.

<HEAD>Hearing Begins On Asset Freezing In Lincoln Savings Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge opened a hearing today on whether to
freeze more than $100 million in Lincoln Savings and Loan assets
that investors allege were illegally transferred overseas.
   The plaintiffs contend the assets were transferred out of the
country after the investors were misled into buying the high-risk
securities known as ``junk bonds.''
   Hundreds of small investors in the Irvine-based savings and
loan, including a Baptist church located next door to a Lincoln
branch, have asked U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson to freeze
the assets of Charles H. Keating, members of his family, and others.
   Lincoln was seized April 14 by federal regulators, one day after
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection. The Lincoln
bailout is expected to require an estimated $2 billion in taxpayer
money.
   Wilson began the hearing by discussing the matter of class
action suits and whether to consolidate various lawsuits against
Keating and Lincoln.
   The suit Wilson was hearing is one of several legal actions
stemming from the downfall of Lincoln and its parent, Phoenix-based
American Continental Corp.
   The lawsuit contends that Lincoln misled 22,000 investors into
buying nearly $200 million in non-rated high-risk securities at the
thrift's 29 branches in Southern California.
   The suit contends that Keating and his family members then
unlawfully converted debt-holder funds to their own use by
investing the money in banks and companies in Switzerland, the
Bahamas and Panama. Company spokesmen and attorneys have in the
past denied that Keating or his executives took part in any fraud.
   The lawsuit specifically traces about $100 million of the funds.
Among the allegations were that Keating took $34 million for his
personal use, and caused Lincoln to pay an additional $25.5 million
to a Dutch company for reasons ``That have never been explained,''
according to the suit.
   The investors want the assets locked in while the courts decide
whether Keating and his company should pay damages to investors
stemming from the failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan and the
bankruptcy of its parent company American Continental.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   AGE DISCRIMINATION
   
   The Court ruled that federal judges may help plaintiffs in age
discrimination suits try to find other possible victims and seek
their participation in such suits.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, ruled against Hoffmann-La Roche
Inc., which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off
some 1,200 employees at New Jersey plants.
   The high court said judges in such ``class action'' suits may
help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination,
who may be unaware of the lawsuit, and solicit their participation.
   The case is Hoffmann-La Roche vs. Sperling, 88-1203.
   
   NOFZIGER
   
   The court refused to reinstate former White House aide Lyn
Nofziger's conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left
the Reagan administration.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that overturned Nofziger's 1988 conviction, 90-day jail
sentence and $30,000 fine.
   The case is U.S. vs. Nofziger, 89-719.
   
   FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
   
   The court shielded the FBI from having to give Grumman Corp.
documents received from another government agency, narrowing the
reach of the Freedom of Information Act.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the documents can be withheld
because they were ``compiled for law enforcement purposes'' and
therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing
government secrecy.
   The case is John Doe Agency vs. John Doe Corp., 88-1083.
   
   SEATBELTS
   
   The court turned away an appeal by an Iowa woman battling her
state's mandatory seatbelt law.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear Linda Diane
Clark's arguments that the law, similar to those in most states,
violates her constitutional rights.
   The case is Clark vs. Iowa, 89-687.
   
   MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS
   
   The court limited the way multinational corporations can use
foreign tax laws to reduce their U.S. taxes, a ruling the Bush
administration said may save the government hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   The court ruled unanimously against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
in a case stemming from operations of Goodyear's British subsidiary
in the early 1970s.
   The case is U.S. vs. Goodyear, 88-1474.

   It won't be quite the social event it was 50
years ago and the big stars will be absent, but that's not stopping
Atlanta from throwing a party for this week's re-creation of the
premiere of ``Gone With the Wind.''
   On the day of the Dec. 15, 1939, premiere, the governor declared
a holiday and an estimated 1 million people turned out to see Clark
Gable, Vivien Leigh and Atlanta's own Margaret Mitchell, author of
the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1936 book on which the movie was based.
   This time, star-seekers will have to settle for 10 minor cast
members and five pairs of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara
look-alikes. Gable and Miss Leigh both died in the 1960s, and Miss
Mitchell died in 1949.
   The 10 surviving cast members will attend a private reunion
Wednesday night and will make a public appearance Thursday. The
look-alikes will compete Tuesday, and the winners will appear at
Thursday night's antebellum ball.
   Friday night's ``re-premiere'' will be held at the ornate Fox
Theatre, opened on Christmas 1929, since the Loew's Grand Theatre,
site of the 1939 gala, is no longer standing. The Fox was saved
from the wrecker's ball in the 1970s and now is on the National
Register of Historic Places,
   Cammie King Conlon, who played Rhett and Scarlett's young
daughter, Bonnie Blue Butler, said the cast reunion will be a
chance for her to reminisce with others who also were children when
they appeared in the movie.
   ``I was 4{ when they did the filming,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Little River, Calif., where she manages a
contemporary art gallery. She said she remembers ``about 12
snapshots, images'' of the experience, but nothing more.
   ``You don't really know how much you remember because people
have told you some things,'' she said. ``I certainly remember the
pony,'' which killed Bonnie Blue in a riding accident.
   ``Clark Gable I remember being a very nice, nice daddy,'' she
added. ``He was considerate of me, my mother said. I don't remember
Vivien Leigh at all.''
   Others expected for the reunion are Butterfly McQueen, who
played Prissy; Patrick Curtis, Ric Holt and Mickey Kuhn, all of
whom played Beau Wilkes, son of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes, at
various ages; Gregg Geiss, who played Bonnie Blue as an infant;
Rand Brooks, who played Scarlett's first husband, Charles Hamilton;
Ann Rutherford and Evelyn Keyes, who portrayed Scarlett's sisters;
and Fred Crane, who played one of the twins courting Scarlett in
the opening scene.
   Two other surviving cast members _ Olivia de Havilland, who
played Melanie, and Alicia Rhett, who played India Wilkes _ sent
their regrets.
   Many of the anniversary activities are sponsored by Turner Home
Entertainment, a division of entrepreneur Ted Turner's media empire.
   Turner acquired the rights to ``Gone With the Wind'' in 1985
when he bought MGM-UA Entertainment Corp.'s film library for $1.5
billion. And he paid for a restored version of the film that has
made a 50th anniversary tour of U.S. theaters this year.
   ``It's his favorite movie,'' said Frank Miller, a Turner
spokesman.
   The $250,000 restoration process used modern technology to make
a new, better quality print from the original negatives. The
restored version will be featured at Friday night's ``re-premiere.''
   Before the film, a motorcade will shuttle celebrities from CNN
Center to the Fox for a reception. Afterward, a champagne breakfast
will re-create another event from the 1939 gala. Tickets for the
evening range from $15 to $100.
   Other activities include tours of historic homes in Atlanta and
suburban Clayton County, where Miss Mitchell set her fictional
plantation Tara; a GWTW exhibit at the Atlanta Historical Society;
and lectures on Miss Mitchell and her book.
   Turner's SuperStation TBS, whose signal is relayed to cable TV
systems by satellite, will broadcast the restored version of the
film three times during the week.

   Bill Webb arrived at his teaching
job Monday wearing his standard flannel shirt and denim pants, the
same type of outfit that got him fired last year for refusing to
conform to a new dress code.
   This time, Webb had a court order upholding his down-home
wardrobe.
   ``He's wearing just what he said he would _ blue jeans and a
flannel shirt,'' said Point Pleasant High School Assistant
Principal Larry Martin. ``Everything's back to normal.''
   The Mason County Board of Education fired Webb from his job at
the high school last December after he refused to conform to a code
that required dress pants and neck ties for male teachers.
   Kanawha County Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman agreed with Webb in
ruling that the dress code is unconstitutional and ordered him
returned to his job.
   School board officials haven't given up on their efforts to
overturn Kaufman's ruling, but they agreed to allow Webb to return
to work while the state Supreme Court considers their appeal.
   Webb, 46, who has taught math at the school since 1968, said he
was ``a little bit apprehensive'' about returning to work. He
slipped through a back entrance to the high school without comment
on Monday, and Principal Michael Whalen ordered reporters and
photographers out of the building.
   ``We're going to have a normal school day,'' Whalen said.
   Martin said there were no problems on Webb's first day back.
   Students who gathered outside a fast food restaurant before
school began said there had been little discussion of Webb's return.
   ``I like him. He's all right,'' said senior Donnie Patterson.
   Another senior, Priscilla Birchfield, said Webb should be forced
to wear dress clothes.
   ``I don't think it's right,'' she said. ``I don't think he
should come to school in his work clothes.''
   Webb, who has a farm across the Ohio River in Gallipolis, Ohio,
said he wears work shirts, jeans and boots because dress clothes
hamper his ability to communicate with students.
   ``There's so many things in my life that I do enjoy, but the one
thing I really enjoy is the interaction with the kids,'' he said
Sunday.

   The prosecution rested today in the
murder trial of a driver who crashed into a church bus, and the
defense opened its case with testimony aimed at showing that the
bus wasn't safe.
   Kentucky Fire Marshal John William Martin testified that the
seat coverings and cushions on the bus ``were in fact combustible
and will burn very rapidly when ignited.''
   Lawyers for Larry Mahoney contend an unsafe bus is to blame for
the 27 deaths and multiple injuries in the May 14, 1988, disaster
south of this Ohio River community. The bus was built before more
stringent federal safety standards went into effect.
   However, not all of Martin's testimony supported that
contention. The fire marshal also testified that dense black smoke
that rolled through the bus could have been caused by the burning
of gasoline alone, not by the seat covers. And he said a protective
cage around the bus' gas tank wouldn't have prevented the fire that
followed the crash.
   Mahoney, who was driving a black Toyota pickup, admits drinking
the day of the crash, driving on the wrong side of Interstate 71
and striking the loaded church bus.
   He is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving.
The defense phase of the trial is expected to wind up by Friday.
   Last week, Assistant Attorney General Paul Richwalsky Jr.
presented a detailed reconstruction of the accident, based largely
upon weeks of study by Kentucky State trooper Henry ``Sonny'' Cease.
   The jury also heard testimony from relatives of 26 of the 27
victims, from police and a medical expert about Mahoney's level of
drunkenness, and from the state's chief medical examiner about the
victims' autopsy results.
   One survivor of the crash testified that he saw two girls flick
cigarette lighters to see inside the darkened bus following the
crash. The survivor recalled the fire getting worse the moment the
lighters were flicked.
   Asked about that today, Martin said he didn't believe an
additional source of ignition would have made any difference if the
fire had already been started.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 people rallied tonight in
Leipzig and many urged German unity, a proposal that Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the new Communist Party chief would harm
East Germany.
   Gorbachev, speaking with party chief Gregor Gysi on Sunday,
praised the party's ``rejection of attempts to damage the
sovereignty of the country,'' the state-run news agency ADN said.
Gysi became party chief Saturday.
   Also today, the four Allied occupiers of divided Berlin _ the
United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ held their
first meeting in 18 years. The Soviets expressed ``favorable
interest'' in a Western plan to boost the international role of
Berlin, according to a joint statement.
   In Leipzig, it was the fourth straight week that calls for
German unity had played a major role in the protests. Pro-democracy
demonstrators continue to pressure East Germany's beleaguered
government to carry through with promises for reforms.
   ``We in Leipzig and those in Hanover (a West German city) are
and will remain Germans,'' said one Leipzig speaker, drawing a huge
roar of approval from the flag-waving crowd. ``What belongs
together will grow together.''
   Earlier, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted that
reunification will come one day, but acknowledged that for now such
a step remains a ``vision.''
   The questions of East German sovereignty have become
increasingly important with the growing turmoil in the Communist
nation. There have been predictions the rapid changes could lead to
steps toward unification with West Germany.
   In his conversation with Gysi, Gorbachev also promised Moscow
would consider providing support ``within the current framework of
conditions,'' ADN said, without elaborating. The dispatch also did
not make clear who called whom.
   On Sunday, tens of thousands of demonstrators braved bitter cold
in eight East German cities to keep up the pressure for change, and
Gysi called for a clear separation of party and government.
   Pro-democracy supporters rallied in freezing weather in Rostock,
Erfurt, East Berlin, Kronskamp, Plauen, Cottbus, Suhl and Ilmenau,
according to ADN.
   In the southern city of Plauen, about 15,000 demonstrators
turned out for a pro-democracy rally called by the New Forum
opposition group.
   Hartmut Krausse, a physician and member of the New Forum
opposition group, told 15,000 people in the southern city of
Ilmenau that talk of ``anarchy, chaos and violence'' was out of
place.
   Despite that appeal, there was a renewed round of calls for
people not to resort to violence as they seek to punish discredited
former Communist rulers, many of whom have been arrested or are
being investigated for abuses of power.
   Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden warned Sunday that
``violence has not been dispelled. An escalation is possible at any
moment.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany, in a
speech Sunday, urged East Germans to exercise restraint and keep
protests free of violence.
   Citizens have been disgusted by the reports of high-living and
corruption by ousted party officials, and in some cases they have
surrounded or stormed local offices of the once-dreaded secret
police.
   The government has claimed that angry citizens have stormed army
bases.
   In the face of massive protests, the Communist Party in the last
two months has ousted two sets of leaders, lifted travel
restrictions, opened the Berlin Wall and abandoned its
constitutionally guaranteed hold on power.
   Gysi, 41, said in a television interview that he backed a
``strict division of party and government.'' But he added, ``This
can't be done in one day. It is a long-term job that is being taken
very seriously.''
   Such separation would be a striking change in East Germany
where, despite recent democratic reforms, party members still hold
most of the important positions in the country.
   There have been warnings that a push toward German
reunification, which some recent demonstrations have urged, could
cause further troubles in East Germany.

   Moslem separatists who kidnapped a Cabinet
minister's daughter agreed Monday to free her, apparently after an
agreement was reached to release some of their jailed colleagues, a
government negotiator said.
   Rubaiya Mufti Sayeed, the youngest daughter of Home Minister
Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, will be released ``any moment,'' said Moosa
Raza, the chief secretary in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir.
   Raza made his announcement shortly after the Monday evening
deadline set by the militants of the Kashmir Liberation Front to
kill the woman unless the government released seven jailed
colleagues, including the group's top leader who was arrested last
month.
   Ms. Sayeed, 22, was kidnapped at gunpoint Friday in the city of
Srinagar as she was going home from work.
   The abduction was the first major crisis to face the 10-day-old
government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh. His appointment of Sayeed
to the ministry that oversees internal security was seen as a move
to appease Moslems who bore the brunt of Hindu-Moslem religious
riots in the fall.
   The kidnapping came a day after Sayeed was appointed head of a
government committee aiming to end separatist campaigns in
Jammu-Kashmir and neighboring Punjab, where Sikh militants are
demanding an independent nation.
   Formed in 1965, the Kashmir Liberation Front wants
Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state with a Moslem majority, to
either become independent or part of neighboring Pakistan, an
Islamic state.
   Raza did not disclose the contents of the agreement that he said
was reached ``using the services of respectable citizens of
Kashmir.''
   ``The deadline has no relevance since the negotiations are going
on. We hope positive results will come out very soon,'' he said.
   One of the negotiators contacted by telephone in Srinagar said
Ms. Sayeed may be released Tuesday. Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir, is about 93 miles north of Jammu, the state's winter
capital.
   The negotiator, who did not wish to be identified, said the
militants had demanded safe passage for their colleagues freed in
the swap. They had agreed to reduce their demand to freedom for
five militants, he said.
   Earlier in the day, a bomb exploded inside an air cargo complex
in Srinagar, injuring at least 15 people and severely damaging the
building, officials said. No one claimed responsibility and it was
not immediately known if the blast was related to the kidnapping.
   Jammu-Kashmnir is the only Moslem majority state in the
officially secular, predominantly Hindu India. Moslems make up 64
percent of the state but nationwide comprise only 11 percent of the
population. Hindus comprise 80 percent of India's 880 million
people.
   Kashmir is claimed both by India and Pakistan, and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since they
gained independence from Britain in 1947.

<TEXT>
   A county politician whose three children
died in a fire has been charged with murder and aggravated arson in
connection with their deaths and the death of a fourth child,
authorities said today.
   Bernon Howery, a Kankakee County Board member, was ordered held
without bond at a court hearing this morning, said Assistant
State's Attorney Brenda Gorski. He is charged with four counts of
murder and one count of aggravated arson, she said.
   The case is to go to a grand jury Friday, and arraignment is
scheduled for next Monday, Ms. Gorski said.
   Police decided to hold Howery on Sunday, after a second round of
questioning following Saturday's fire, she said.
   ``He's the only person that we've charged,'' Ms. Gorski said,
though several other people were questioned.
   The bodies of Justina Howery, 5, her sister, Prima, 10, their
brother, Joel, 9, all Howery's children; and their half sister,
Ledonja Walls, 11, were found early Saturday in an upstairs closet
a short time after a fire engulfed their mother's Kankakee home.
   The fire appeared to have been started in piles of clothes
placed at several locations in the house, according to Kankakee
Police Lt. William Cantrell.
   Kankakee County Coroner James Orrison said the victims died of
smoke inhalation. Their mother and their uncle, who lived with
them, were away at the time of the incident, officials said. Howery
lives near them.

<HEAD>65 Bodies of Suspected Sinhalese Radicals Found</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities found the bodies of 65
suspected Sinhalese radicals _ some shot, others burned _ and
military officials said Monday that pro-government vigilantes had
done the killings.
   The bodies were discovered after Sinhalese radicals set fire to
dozens of public buses over the weekend in central and southern Sri
Lanka.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the victims were believed members of the People's Liberation
Front, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese guerrilla group trying to
overthrow the government for making peace overtures to Tamil
secessionists in the northeast.
   The front began its campaign in 1987 and has continued to attack
the government although its six top leaders were killed last month
by government forces.
   On Sunday, the militants burned 32 government-owned buses in
Ambalantota, about 90 miles south of Colombo, a government
statement said.
   Also Sunday, at least 16 more government-owned buses were set
ablaze in other attacks and two railway engines and a railroad
station were burned at Gampha district's Yagoda village, 15 miles
northeast of Colombo, the government said.
   To counter the militant violence, human rights groups say, the
government this year set up vigilante groups which have killed
hundreds of civilians suspected of associating with the front. The
government denies the charge.
   The military officials on Monday, however, blamed pro-government
vigilantes for the killings that were reported since Sunday in the
Sinhalese heartland of central and southern Sri Lanka, where the
front's campaign has focused.
   Military officials said 21 bodies were found in Wellawaya
village in Monaragala district, 100 miles east of Colombo. Most of
the victims were Sinhalese men between the ages 18 and 30, the
officials said.
   They said 18 bodies were found at Mavaralla village in central
Kegalle district, 11 at southern Hakmana town, six in the central
town of Kandy and the nine in other towns.
   More than 6,000 people have died in the Sinhalese violence that
was sparked by an India-sponsored peace accord signed by the
government in July 1987 with Tamil rebels demanding a separate
homeland for their minority community.
   The front alleged the accord too many concessions to the Tamils,
who are mainly Hindus and comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. Tamils claim they are discriminated against in jobs
and education by the Sinhalese who are mainly Buddhists and make up
75 percent of the population. The Sinhalese also control the
government and the military.
   The Sinhalese rebels also opposed the presence of Indian
peacekeeping troops, deployed in the north and the east to
supervise the peace accord. India has begun withdrawing its
soldiers from most areas ahead of a Dec. 31 deadline, but the
vacuum has resulted in a power struggle among Tamil groups.
   Three Tamils were killed late Sunday and early Monday in
fighting between two groups, the officials said.
   At least 10,000 Sri Lankans have died in the Tamil rebellion
that started in 1983 and the post-accord violence.

<HEAD>Drug Lord Found Guilty Of Ordering Officer's Killing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug lord Howard ``Pappy'' Mason was found
guilty today of ordering the execution-style murder of police
Officer Edward Byrne, a slaying that came to symbolize the nation's
battle against illegal drugs.
   The 31-year-old defendant was convicted on all 11 counts of drug
conspiracy. Prosecutors charged he had ordered the officer's
slaying in the course of running a drug empire that brought in as
much as $10,000 a week.
   He faces a mandatory life prison term when he is sentenced by
U.S. District Judge Edward R. Korman.
   The killing of the rookie policemen on Feb. 26, 1988, while he
guarded a witness in a drug case became an issue in last year's
presidential campaign. Byrne's parents gave their dead son's police
badge to then-Vice President Bush during a campaign appearance, and
Bush cited the slaying as an example of why he believed the death
penalty was needed.
   The verdict came in the third day of deliberations. The panel
met for 3{ hours Friday and a full day Saturday before resuming
this morning.
   Mason was not present at Byrne's slaying. Two days before, he
had been convicted and jailed for weapons possession.
   But prosecutors say he sent word from his jail cell to his top
lieutenant that he wanted the blood of any police officer.
   In his closing arguments Friday, defense attorney Harry C.
Batchelder Jr. countered by saying the government's witnesses were
admitted murderers, drug addicts and thieves who were given deals
for their cooperation.
   Byrne, 22, was killed instantly by four members of Mason's gang
who pumped five bullets into his head as he sat in his patrol car
guarding the firebombed home of a witness in a drug case.
   The killers were convicted earlier this year and sentenced to
the maximum 25 years to life in jail.
   Mason hasn't been seen much during his trial, which began about
two weeks ago. Most days, including today, he has elected to stay
in his courthouse holding cell, which is rigged with closed-circuit
TV to let him follow the proceedings.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Aids Workers in Age-Bias Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday made employers
easier targets for class action age-bias lawsuits by allowing
federal judges to lend a hand in alerting possible victims of
discrimination.
   In a 7-2 ruling, the court let judges help plaintiffs in such
suits locate other possible victims and seek their participation.
   The decision is a boost to workers suing Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.,
which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off or
demoting some 1,200 employees at New Jersey plants.
   In other action, the court:
   _Refused to reinstate former White House aide Lyn Nofziger's
conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left the Reagan
administration. The justices declined to disturb a federal appeals
court ruling that overturned Nofziger's 1988 conviction, 90-day
jail sentence and $30,000 fine.
   _Shielded the FBI from having to give Grumman Corp. documents
received from another government agency, narrowing the reach of the
Freedom of Information Act. By a 6-3 vote, the court said the
documents were exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing
government secrecy.
   _Unanimously limited the way multinational corporations can use
foreign tax laws to reduce their U.S. taxes, a ruling the Bush
administration said may save the government hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   _Rejected arguments that Iowa's mandatory seatbelt law is
unconstitutional.
   _Disbarred former Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., from practicing law
before the high court and took a first step toward disbarring
former U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. Biaggi was convicted
of racketeering and Nixon of lying to a grand jury.
   In the age-bias case, the court said federal law permits judges
to help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination,
who may be unaware of the lawsuit, and solicit their participation.
   In his opinion for the court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said
judges should have leeway but not ``unbridled discretion'' to
manage class action suits in this fashion.
   That ``serves the legitimate goal'' of avoiding multiple suits
in the same case and lets the judge set uniform dates for
plaintiffs to announce their participation, he said.
   Kennedy cautioned that judges ``must be scrupulous to respect
judicial neutrality'' and ``take care to avoid even the
appearance'' they are endorsing a suit.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined Justice Antonin Scalia
in dissent.
   Scalia, writing for both, said federal law does not authorize
judges ``to undertake the unheard-of role of midwifing'' lawsuits
against employers.
   Hoffmann-La Roche dismissed or demoted about 1,200 workers Feb.
4, 1985, in what was dubbed ``Black Monday'' by many veteran
employees. They said a disproportionately high number of laid-off
or demoted workers were over 40 years old.
   A group of older workers sued, alleging the company violated the
federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The group's leaders
then sought to contact all fired workers over 40 eligible to join
the lawsuit.
   Some 400 employees agreed to join, but the plaintiffs said they
believed there might be 200 or more additional workers who were not
aware of the suit and sought to contact them.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman ordered the company to
provide the names and addresses of all fired workers. He said that
once the workers are found, they may be sent an explanation of the
suit and a form seeking their consent to join the court fight.
   The form said the judge authorized the mailing but took no
position on the merits of the case.
   Increasing the number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big
advantage for the workers by helping them spread out court costs.
In seeking workers to join the suit against Hoffmann-La Roche, the
leaders of the court fight requested a $200 contribution to help
defray the costs.
   The stakes also go up for the employer who may be forced to pay
damages to more workers.

   Former White House aide Lyn Nofziger won a
legal victory Monday when the Supreme Court refused to reinstate
his 1988 illegal lobbying conviction.
   ``That kind of news is always welcome. It certainly makes the
holiday season a bit brighter,'' said Nofziger's lawyer, Lawrence
Barcella.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that overturned Nofziger's conviction on charges he
illegally lobbied top presidential aides within a year of leaving
the Reagan administration.
   Barcella said dropping any further prosecution of Nofziger
represents ``the only humane course.'' But independent counsel
James McKay declined comment, saying he would have an announcement
at some future date.
   Nofziger was White House political director from 1981, when
President Reagan took office, until early 1982.
   He was convicted of lobbying on behalf of three private clients
_ the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a maritime workers union and
Fairchild Corp. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and fined
$30,000.
   Prosecutors said Nofziger lobbied for an Army engine contract
for Wedtech, for the placement of civilian sailors on Navy vessels
and for continued Air Force purchases of an antitank aircraft made
by Fairchild.
   He was tried under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which
imposes a one-year ban on lobbying former colleagues after a person
leaves service in the federal government's executive branch.
   The ban covered lobbying on any matter in which the lobbyist's
former agency ``has a direct and substantial interest.''
   Nofziger contended he did not violate the law because he was
trying to stimulate, not influence or exploit, White House interest
on issues of concern to his clients.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled June 27 that
Noziger's criminal indictment should have been dismissed because it
did not charge him with having ``knowingly'' lobbied on matters in
which White House officials possessed a direct and substantial
interest.
   In his appeal, independent counsel McKay said the appeals court
ruling hampers Congress' attempt to deal with ``the spectacle of
high-level government officials using the `revolving door' to turn
their government service into lucrative lobbying businesses when
the ink had barely dried on their resignations.''
   Requiring prosecutors to prove a former government employee knew
the subject of his lobbying was of ``direct and substantial''
interest to his former agency ``will reward purposeful ignorance or
heedlessness,'' McKay argued.
   Lawyers for Nofziger said the appeals court ruling is unlikely
to have any future impact because of legislation enacted by
Congress in November.
   The legislation, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, eliminates the
``direct and substantial'' interest requirement to create a flat
ban on government employees lobbying their former agencies within a
year of their resignations.

   President Bush today defended his decision to
send two top aides to Beijing over the weekend, and said he would
``keep looking for ways to find common ground'' with Chinese
leaders despite continuing unhappiness with their crackdown last
spring against pro-democracy forces.
   Bush stressed that the trip by national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft and a top State Department aide did not amount to
normalization of relations. Those who suggest otherwise ``simply do
not know what they are talking about,'' he said.
   Democrats were criticizing Bush even as he spoke. Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said the mission by
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger was
``embarrassing kowtowing'' to a brutal regime.
   But Bush said he took the action because ``I do not want to
isolate the Chinese people.''
   The president said the United States maintains contacts with
several countries that have ``egregious records on human rights.''
As for the crackdown in Beijing last June, Bush said, ``The Chinese
know they have to address themselves to the problems that were
inherent in this episode.''
   Sanctions imposed by Bush after the crackdown remain in effect.
   The president made his comments to a group of editorial writers
gathered in an auditorium across the street from the White House.
   He opened the session with a review of his first year as
president. Citing an improved U.S.-Soviet relationship and other
developments, he said, ``I'm not overly satisfied but I think
generally the first year has gone pretty well.''
   Bush said the economy has continued to expand and create new
jobs and that he had ``been able to keep my pledge of no new
taxes.''
   Congress, he said, has enacted a savings and loan bailout bill
and made a start on clean air and ethics legislation.
   At the same time, Bush said he differed with the Democratic
majorities of the House and Senate over child care legislation, and
would press Congress to pass his anti-crime package when it returns
in January.
   ``All in all it's been a productive year, we've proposed a lot
of new initiatives,'' he said.
   Bush said he still planned to attend a drug summit scheduled for
next year in Cartegena, Columbia, despite concerns that the visit
would pose a security risk.
   ``I don't want to send the signal that nobody should go to
Columbia,'' Bush said, praising the government's efforts to bring
the drug traffickers to justice.
   He added, however that he would reassess the situation prior to
the trip. ``I will not do anything imprudent,'' he said. ``Nobody
has ever accused me of being too daring.''
   As for China, Bush responded with an emphatic ``No'' when asked
if he worried that the Scowcroft-Eagleburger trip would signal the
Soviets that he would tolerate a crackdown on pro-democracy
demostrators in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``I have no concern about that at all as long as we are properly
positioned in favor of human rights ... and as long as the Soviet
Union knew that we are not sending a signal of quote total
normalization unquote. I will be careful that we do not send that
signal,'' he said.
   At the same time, Bush said he was ``very pleased today in the
wake of General Scowcroft's visit to notice that the Chinese
Foreign Ministry stated that they would not sell missiles to any
Mideast countries.'' He added that Scowcroft had raised the issue
in his weekend talks with Chinese leaders, and the Chinese made
their announcement before the national security adviser and
Eagleburger had returned to Washington.
   Scowcroft planned to brief Bush later today on the trip.
   Bush said he had sent his top aides to Beijing to discuss the
results of the Malta summit with the Chinese leaders.
   ``I do not want to isolate the Chinese people. I don't want to
hurt the Chinese people,'' he said.
   ``I realize the difficulty of this relationshiop but I don't
want to make it any worse,'' he said, referring to the strains
following the bloody crackdown against demonstrating students last
June.
   He said he was ``going to keep looking for ways to find common
ground'' with China.
   The president made no mention of Fang Lizhi, the prominent
Chinese dissident who has been given sanctuary from Chinese
authorities in the American Embassy in Beijing.
   Bush spoke against a backdrop of stepped up Democratic criticism
of his decision to send Scowcroft and Eagleburger.
   ``The administration supports human rights in its words,''
Mitchell said. ``It does not do so in its deeds ... These actions
make a mockery of our profession of concern for human rights and
are inconsistent with our stated ideals.''
   The trip was not announced until after the officials had landed
in Beijing at 1 a.m. EST on Saturday. Scowcroft toasted China's
leaders at a televised banquet and called for improved relations.
   ``This trip was not intended to develop normal relations with
China in any immediate sense,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said. ``It's going to happen over a longer period of
time, we hope, but they're not much different today than it was
three days ago.''
   ``We have the same concerns. We have the same indignation. We
have the same principles. We have the same urgings for their
country that we had before,'' said Fitzwater.
   He acknowledged that the United States has seen no changes in
China's behavior since leaders sent in tanks and troops to
Tienanmen Square, killing hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators
and crushing a months-long protest.
   ``Enormous changes are taking place in the world. ... We need
some uinderstanding of their position'' on the breakthroughs for
democracy and freedom in the East bloc nations, Fitzwater said.
   The Chinese government has been critical of the changes in
Eastern Europe.
   ``The sanctions have not changed. It's not business as usual.
... It simply is the fact we feel China is a country that has to be
dealt with,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush, former U.S. envoy to China, barred high-level contacts
with Chinese leaders after they sent tanks into Tiananmen Square.
He also cut off military sales to the communist regime. The
president said relations could not be normalized until the
government honored basic human rights. He also gave refuge to
Chinese students in the United States, although he recently vetoed
a bill that would have written that protection into law.
   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher declined to
specify issues raised by the two U.S. officials on their visit. But
he acknowledged that the proliferation of ballistic missiles ``has
been and remains high on our agenda with the Chinese.''
   And he noted that China's government-controlled media termed
reports of an impending missile sale to Syria ``groundless'' and
said China has no plans to sell such missiles to any Middle Eastern
country. ``We think it's noteworth that they reiterated'' the
denials, Boucher said.

   It just wouldn't be Christmas for
thousands of South Carolinians if M.L. Corley didn't turn his home,
yard and pond into the stuff fairy tales are made of.
   A dozen trees in the front yard are abloom with colored lights,
as are the house, two bridges leading to the pond and the gazebo on
an island in the water. Poinsettias form collars at the bases of
the trees.
   Each tier and railing of the white, two-story, colonial-style
home is draped with green garland, and wreaths with red bows peek
out from every window. From the kitchen window, Santa Claus and
Mrs. Claus, standing 2{ feet tall, nod and open and close their
arms.
   The bridges to the pond behind the house also are strung with
garlands, and 6-foot candy canes and lollipops stand sentry on the
bridge to the island.
   ``I don't know whether it's elaborate or not, but it's right
attractive,'' Corely said.
   Some 25,000 people followed homemade traffic signs around his
circular driveway last year to view the display in this suburb of
Columbia.
   Two weeks after it went up this year on Thanksgiving Day, a
traffic counter indicated more than 6,200 people had already taken
the tour, which takes visitors from the front of the house around
to the back yard and pond.
   ``And that's not including the people who just drive by the
house,'' Corley said. ``We get quite a jam here.''
   ``The neighbors don't mind the traffic because they do it,
too,'' Corley said, referring to less elaborate Christmas displays
on his block.
   Corley, 73, began decorating his home in the late 1940s, then
started devoting more time to the display after retiring eight
years ago from his sawmill and wood procurement business.
   Now, the most elaborate setup might be around the gazebo.
Poinsettias spread like patches of fiery snow. Giant red, yellow
and green lollipops adorn the posts and sides, and a life-sized
Santa stands at the back entrance.
   Despite all the glowing and brightly colored decorations, ducks
still come by for a dip in the pond.
   When Christmas Day draws nearer, a friend posing as Santa Claus
comes by and hands out candy to visiting children.
   Corley hasn't even tried to count the number of wreaths
decorating the property, and as for the number of lights, ``I don't
want to know,'' he said.
   ``I just wanted to thank the good Lord that I was able to
decorate so people could come by and see it,'' he said.

   A state judge on Monday reduced to
$45,000 a $1 million award given to a man by a jury that found a
Zen Buddhist community next to the plaintiff's property had created
a nuisance.
   The Buddhists had placed 200 fluorescent stakes around the man's
property in Pound Ridge and used chain saws and other power
equipment at odd hours.
   State Supreme Court Justice Matthew Coppola agreed the
Wellspring Zendo created a nuisance, but found there was no basis
for so big an award.
   In addition to cutting the award to $45,000, he ordered the
religious community to remove the stakes and restrict the use of
power equipment to Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. He
also directed the group to close windows and doors before their 5
a.m. chant.
   The jury award was made Friday in a lawsuit filed by homeowner
Bradley Nitkin, who sought $2.5 million, claiming the religious
community was trying to intimidate him into moving from the
community in southeastern New York state.
   The community's lawyer, Douglas Hoyt, said the ruling would be
appealed because of the requirement that the community close its
windows and doors during services, which he said was an
interference with freedom of religion.
   ``I don't think the court has the right to impose such
restrictions,'' said Hoyt. ``We didn't come here just to fight
Bradley Nitkin, but because of our religious freedom.''
   Coppola's ruling caps a two-year struggle between Nitkin and the
Wellspring Zendo community.
   Nitkin, a real estate lawyer, claimed the religious community
had consistently harassed him and his family by clanging cymbals
and chanting at 5 a.m. He said the group used power equipment and
chain saws at all hours and on weekends and Christmas.
   He said he and his wife and 2-year-old daughter spend most of
their time in a New York City apartment, even though they had
planned to move to Pound Ridge permanently. He said Monday had not
yet decided about moving permanently to Pound Ridge.
   ``Freedom of religion had nothing to do with it,'' said Nitkin's
lawyer, Paul Robbins. ``The Nitkins wanted to enjoy their property.
The monetary damages were incidental.''
   Wellspring is used as a retreat by 20 to 30 people at a time.
   The group is suing Pound Ridge for $65 million, claiming new
ordinances for non-residential uses in residential areas violate
their freedom of religion.

   There's a Santa here who knows that the
little ones are sometimes naughty instead of nice. So he wears
extra thick clothing to guard against bites and scratches.
   ``Santa Paws'' also wears flea and tick powder and keeps a red
towel handy for accidents.
   Santa Paws is Bill Stovall, a retired Army major who played
Santa last weekend for about 100 animals in a fundraiser for the
Pensacola Humane Society. For $5, Rover could climb into Santa's
lap and ask for that extra juicy Christmas bone.
   Stovall, who has played Santa to children as well as animals at
the society's animal shelter, said he preferred the latter.
   ``I've never had a pet that is obnoxious, but every once in a
while you get a kid that is,'' said Stovall, seated in front of a
Christmas tree surrounded by unopened Alpo.
   In four years, he has played Santa to dogs and cats of all
sizes, ferrets, rabbits, goats and one ``maladjusted mallard''
whose owners said she lays green eggs and hates the water.
   ``I'm happy no one has brought a snake,'' Stovall said.
   He has been bitten only once: last year by a rare Chinese
crested dog named Fievel. The tiny terror took a parting nip at his
fingers this year but missed.
   Donna Arnett of Pensacola Beach brought two nervous cats,
``Lorelei'' and ``Molly,'' and told Santa, ``They want shrimp and
livers for Christmas.''
   And yes, Virginia King discovered, there is a Santa Paws. The
Pensacola woman brought her two poodles, ``Trixie'' and
``Samantha'' to sit on Santa's lap.
   ``My children have already grown up,'' she said. ``These are
part of my family.''

   The holidays are here and for many people
Christmas won't be complete until they get a piece of mail from
this tiny central Wisconsin village.
   The U.S. Postal Service office here is inundated with requests
for a rubber-stamped symbol from the village that stakes claim as
home of Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer.
   ``I think it's nifty,'' said Bruce Hayry, who is running the
Rudolph post office until a permanent postmaster is found. ``I
really do. It's something different.''
   With a rubber stamper, post office workers press a stamp of
Rudolph _ complete with a shiny nose _ on mail. The stamp measures
1.5 inches wide and 2 inches high and is underscored with:
``Rudolph, Wisconsin, Home of Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer.''
   Hayry said some want the stamps to dress up their Christmas
cards, while others want it for their stamp collections. Collectors
send stamped envelopes with their addresses to the post office and
ask that they be sent back with the Rudolph stamp, he said.
   Past years' requests have come from more than a dozen states.
   The idea and original design for the stamp came from Lillian
Blonien, Rudolph postmaster from 1951 to 1971.
   The Rudolph character was created in 1939 by Ron May, a catalog
copywriter for Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., who wrote a poem about the
famous reindeer. A song by Johnny Marks followed in 1949, and the
rest is history.
   The village has been around considerably longer. It got its name
in 1856 from Rudolph Hecox, the first settler to live there.

   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks
Monday to editorial page editors:
   President Bush: Well, thank you. Please be seated and thank you
all for coming. I _ particularly looking forward to this because
you do represent a unique category of journalism. What I want to do
is just make a few brief comments and then refer _ take your
questions for a while.
   First, just a word on the recent Malta visit. I think it was
very promising. We agreed, Mr. Gorbachev and I agreed to hold a
summit in the United States, next year in June. We agreed that our
foreign ninisters would meet in the Soviet Union next month.
   We are on the brink of exciting new US-Soviet relations and
having said that there are still some difficulties. Our secretary
of state is abroad right now talking about some of the problems
facing Europe, but basically I end the year more optimistic than
when I began it and very encouraged about the change that's taking
place inside the Soviet Union and all across Eastern Europe.
   On the Third World debt question, we came up with a proposal for
solving it, the so-called Brady Plan. I want to be sure that we
move further during next year in terms of implementation. At least
we spelled out some broad parameters in which we _ with which to
try to help solve _ in which to try to help solve the problems of
Third World debt. But as one who is very interested in this
hemisphere, I can tell you that there is enormous interest on the
part of our friends to the south, small countries and large, that
we get on with this and that our allies and others _ private
banking interests _ help us get on with this.
   On the economy, we end the year with a still growing economy,
the lowest unemployment rate in 15 years, and 20.5 million new jobs
created over the last several years _ been able to keep my pledge
of ``no new taxes'' for this year. And generally, I feel pretty
good about it. There's some signs of concern that have been
expressed from time to time by the Fed, but I think the main thing
now is to keep it growing until every American benefits by this,
the longest recovery in history.
   And on the ethics package _ we sent an ethics package up early.
Congress did incorporate many of the provisions in our
government-wide ethics package into the law passed recently that
was coupled with the congressional pay raise. I think the reform
was long overdue. We didn't get everything we want, but we made a
beginning out there.
   On S&amp;Ls, the package, which was not easy to come by, guarantees
depositors that money will be safe and sets tough new standards to
ensure that the crisis doesn't happen again. I'm disappointed in
some ways with the Congress and with our progress, or lack thereof,
in some areas.
   The crime package _ we sent a comprehensive violent crime
control package which proposes augmenting enforcement and
prosecution, strengthening current law, restricting certain
semi-automatic weapons and expanding prison capacity. But, very
candidly, it has not been acted on; so I'm going to have to come
back now after the first of the year and try to push on that.
   Clean air _ the House and the Senate took steps toward _ took
some steps toward passing our bill this year, but we had some good
clean air proposals. They were widely received, bipartisan fashion,
but I'm disappointed that we haven't gone further there.
   Child care _ I'm in a fight with the Congress in terms of
philosophy on child care. I want to have as much choice as
possible. We sent up a new major _ a new child-care bill and
proposed $250 million increase in Headstart this year, too. And now
we're in the final throes of our budget process, addressing these
questions again. But I think you'll see some early action on child
care.
   All in all, it's been a productive year. We've proposed a lot of
new initiatives. We _ I exercised the veto 10 times, and to date,
was not overridden on it. We've made progress. I didn't mention the
minimum wage, for example, but I had to hold the line on what I
though was right, and then we did pass it at the level that I
suggested. But I am not overly satisfied, but I think generally
that the first year has gone pretty well.

<HEAD>Violence Would Negate Election, State Department Says</HEAD>

   Continued violence against Nicaragua's
political opposition would ensure that February's national
elections will be dismissed as illegitimate, a State Department
spokesman said Monday.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government ``is at a
crossroads,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher.
   ``It can hold free and fair elections without violence and
intimidation, and begin the process of bringing peace to Nicaragua.
Or it can continue to turn the thugs loose on peaceful opposition
rallies, thereby ensuring the election results will be deemed
illegitimate and that the crisis in Central America will
continue,'' Boucher said.
   The comments were triggered by a Sunday rally by the opposition
coalition UNO at Masatepe, 30 miles south of Managua, which turned
into a machete-slashing riot that left one dead and more than 20
injured. Foreign observers blamed Sandinista sympathizers for the
violence.
   Boucher characterized the provocateurs as ``a
Sandinista-controlled mob wielding clubs and machetes'' and said
``Sandinista police and security forces, though asked to intervene
by international observers, did nothing to halt the violence.''
   The opposition, a coalition of more than a dozen parties, is
promoting publisher Violeta Chamorro as its candidate to replace
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega as president in elections set for
Feb. 25.
   One American observer, Bob Beckel, said it was clear the
Sandinistas precipitated the riot.
   ``There were rocks being thrown, there were boards with nails,
and somebody was macheted to death in front of me,'' said Beckel,
former campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate
Walter Mondale and an opponent of the U.S. policy of support for
the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.
   ``And there were bullets being fired. So you can't look at this
incident today and not say that this thing was completely out of
hand. And what the UNO was trying to do was have a rally _ a
regular, old political rally. And it turned into a bloody, nasty
massacre.''
   Beckel said one UNO supporter was killed by a machete just a few
feet from him, and one woman lost her arm when she was hacked by a
machete.
   ``I thought I'd seen some politics in my life, but this one _
this was more politics than I'll ever want to see, frankly,'' he
said. ``It was very ugly, and I think the sad part about it is, you
can't witness what we saw today and believe there's any way
there'll be a fair election in this country.''
   At the State Department, Boucher called it ``the latest in a
string of Sandinista-sponsored attacks on Nicaragua's internal
opposition'' since a cease-fire with the Contra rebels was lifted
Nov. 1.
   As an example, Boucher said a ``Sandinista mob'' attacked a
peaceful UNO meeting Dec. 3 at Cofradias, a village 12 miles east
of Managua, leaving 20 people injured, including women and children.
   ``The Sandinistas promised (in signing a regional peace accord)
to hold free and fair elections,'' he said. ``We call on them to
live up to this promise by ending attacks on the opposition.''

<HEAD>Report: Feds May Drop William Keating from Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials are expected to drop William J.
Keating as a defendant in a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit stemming
from the failure of a savings and loan run by his brother, Charles,
The Detroit News reported Monday.
   William Keating, 62, president and chief executive officer of
the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which oversees the joint business
operations of The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press, has
demonstrated to federal lawyers that he served more briefly than
public records stated as a director of the parent company of the
failed thrift, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources
it said were familiar with the case.
   The lawsuit filed in Phoenix by the Resolution Trust Corp., the
federal agency responsible for cleaning up the thrift industry,
accuses Charles Keating and other senior company officers of
devising a scheme to loot money from Lincoln Savings and Loan of
Irvine, Calif.
   Charles Keating, his son and five other top company executives
are accused under civil fraud and racketeering statutes.
   William Keating is not accused of fraud and racketeering, but is
named in three of 15 counts and is accused of negligence and breach
of fiduciary duty.
   William Keating, a former congressman, has said he served on the
board of directors of American Continental Corp. of Phoenix from
February to August 1986. The newspaper reported that he had said he
left the board because he didn't have time to travel from his home
in Cincinnati to board meetings in Phoenix.
   The federal lawsuit said William Keating served on the board of
American Continental until March 1987. American Continental filed
for bankruptcy protection the next month. A day after the filing,
federal regulators seized Lincoln, whose losses of federally
insured deposits are projected to reach $2 billion.
   The newspaper said William Keating declined to be interviewed
concerning the lawsuit. A secretary in his Detroit office said he
was out of town on a business trip Monday and unavailable for
comment.
   William Keating's lawyer, Chester Kamin of Chicago, would say
only that ``we're taking steps'' to remove William Keating from the
lawsuit, the newspaper said.
   The Detroit News said federal officials were expected to drop
Keating from the lawsuit within days, but were expected to reserve
the right to reinstate him if warranted by new facts.
   Kate Speers, a spokeswoman for Resolution Trust Corp. in
Washington, said Monday she could not immediately provide comment
on the Detroit News story.
   The newspapers said that removal of William Keating from the
lawsuit would lift a cloud that has hung over the man who has had a
distinguished record as a newspaper executive and public official.
In addition to two terms in Congress, William Keating is a former
municipal and common pleas judge and Cincinnati city councilman.
William Keating also is chairman of the board of directors of The
Associated Press.
   Also involved in the controversy are five U.S. senators who
received campaign contributions from American Continental. The
senators are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee and
the FBI for their involvement on Lincoln's behalf.
   The newspaper said there is no evidence William Keating received
any large amounts of money from American Continental other than
fees paid for attending directors' meetings. It said payments to
directors ranged from $3,500 to $7,000 per meeting between 1985 and
1987. William Keating owned 1,000 shares of American Continental
stock but there is no indication he sold the stock back to the
company, the newspaper reported.
   Among the inquiries into Charles Keating's financial activities
is one involving American Continental's purchase of $16 million in
company stock from him and his immediate family under an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan financed with money borrowed against Lincoln's
assets.
   Charles Keating has denied wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   I do want to make one comment before taking questions on the
recent visit of Gen. Scowcroft to China. There's a lot of interest
in that. And following the meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, it seemed to
me that it would be appropriate to brief the Chinese leaders.
   I made clear to them before the Malta meeting that I wanted to
do this. I must say, I was very pleased today in the wake of Gen.
Scowcroft's visit to notice that the Chinese Foreign Ministry
stated that they would not sell missiles to any Middle East
countries. That subject was raised by Gen. Scowcroft, and in my
view, it's a very sound development.
   And I do not want to isolate the Chinese people. I don't want to
hurt the Chinese people. We have certain sanctions. I hope I
needn't reiterate my concerns about the events that took place in
Tiananmen Square. I think we were positioned in the forefront of
human rights concerns. But _ and I think the Chinese know that they
still have to address themselves to the problems that were inherent
in this episode.
   But I don't want to see that China remains totally isolated. I
don't want to take any further steps that are going to hurt the
Chinese people. And I was very pleased that this statement on the
missiles subject having been raised by Gen. Scowcroft took place
before he barely hit the ground here. There was some discussion
about the Pelosi bill, and some political figures accusing me of
not caring about human rights because I would not sign that bill.
   We have enacted by executive order everything that that bill did
_ would have done _ and I want to keep control of managing the
foreign policy of this country as much as I can. And I didn't think
that legislation was necessary, and I hope that the Congress comes
back and takes a hard look at that and then we'll go forward
together as we have in the past.
   But generally speaking, I realize the difficulty of this
relationship, but I don't want to make it any worse. I'd like to
think it would improve. We have contacts with countries that _ that
have egregious records on human rights and _ so I am going to keep
looking for ways to find common ground, but I realize _ and I would
say to those who are out there churning around, saying that we have
normalized relations with China, that they simply do not know what
they are talking about.
   Now, I will be glad to take any question. Yes, sir?
   Q: Mr. President ... Since the Malta summit, Vice President
Quayle has expressed some disappointment with regard to the Soviet
Union's activities in Central America consequently. Does this
reflect the views of the administration or did you pick up at the
Malta meeting some indication that the Soviets may be more
forthcoming and cooperative as our relationship develops?
   A: Well, I expressed the views of the United States government
at the Malta meeting that I was concerned about their actions in
Central America, and so I think the Vice President was reiterating
a view that he knew I held.
   I'd like to think there would be some _ some change in their
philosophy there. I had a phone call that I told Mr. Gorbachev
about, from Oscar Arias, in which Arias simply asked me to raise
with Gorbachev the question of Soviet support for Cuba _ Arias
putting a lot of blame on Cuba for the export of revolution into
these fragile democracies in Central America and, indeed, in South
America.
   So I raised the question very forcefully, and I hope that the
Soviet Union got the message that it is impossible to have totally
smooth relations with us as long as they are supporting the export
of revolution into these democratically elected countries. So there
is no difference between myself and the vice president on this
matter, and he was reiterating, really, a position that I have
taken. I'll try to go from side-to-side. Sir?

   Actor Gary Busey, recovering from a severe
head injury he suffered in a motorcycle accident, says he has
changed his mind and now advocates the use of helmets.
   ``Next time you're doing 45 mph, look at the curb and think
about slam-dancing with it once, and you'll start thinking about
helmets,'' Busey said recently on the ``Arsenio Hall Show.''
   Busey was not wearing a helmet a year ago when his motorcycle
struck a curb in Culver City, resulting in a severe head injury. In
the months following the accident, he insisted on his right not to
wear head protection while biking.
   Before the accident, Busey and others helped defeat a proposed
state law forcing motorcycle riders to wear helmets.
   But during the appearance on the syndicated television show,
Busey told Hall he had a change of heart.
   ``I have a whole new attitude about helmeting, my attitude now
is becoming helmet-conscious, to wear one,'' Busey said. The actor,
who needed rehabilitation to recover from the injury, said he
reflected on the safety of young riders.

   The wife of the man who helped Olympic
gold medalist Nadia Comaneci escape from Romania says she didn't
sleep for days after she learned of her husband's affair _ along
with the rest of the world.
   Maria Panait said when she first learned of her husband's role
in Comaneci's defection she was proud. But her pride turned to
devastation when Comaneci and Panait appeared together at a news
conference to announce their relationship.
   Mrs. Panait said the Romanian gymnast has ruined her marriage
and that she has not heard from her husband since the escape.
   ``I didn't sleep for five days, I've lost 10 pounds, it's been
very hard,'' said Mrs. Panait, 25, who lives in Hallandale with her
four children.
   Mrs. Panait's children also appeared with their mother on a
television news show Monday to say they missed their father.
   When Comaneci was asked last week about Panait's marriage, she
said ``So what.'' Panait also said that his wife would understand
his relationship with Comaneci.
   Comaneci, 28, charmed viewers of the 1976 Olympics with her
perfect 10s. She slogged six hours through mud and ice Nov. 28 to
flee her homeland, leaving behind her three gold medals, her family
and her life of privilege.

   Chris Evert had a come-from-behind victory over
her good friend and longtime rival Martina Navratilova in the final
exhibition match of what was billed as Evert's ``farewell tour.''
   But later Sunday, Evert indicated there might be plenty of good
volleys yet to come.
   Evert started slow but came back to defeat Navratilova 4-6, 6-3,
6-2, before 12,000 fans in The Omni.
   The contest brought to an end the six-city exhibition tour begun
in late September after Evert retired from the pro circuit. On
Saturday in Houston, Evert lost to Martina Navratilova 7-5, 6-4.
   But Evert said the 16-year, 80-match rivalry with Navratilova
might not be over yet.
   ``I never wanted to quit cold turkey,'' she said. ``As long as
Martina is open to touring, we may do this for another year.''
   Evert, who will turn 35 later this month, plans to remain active
in tennis through exhibition and charity matches. She also is to be
a commentator for NBC's coverage of the 1990 French Open and
Wimbledon tournaments.

   Mother Teresa was given strict orders
when she was released Monday from a hospital after getting a
pacemaker _ complete rest.
   ``We thank everyone who prayed for her during the crucial
days,'' said Sister Priscilla after the 79-year-old Roman Catholic
nun returned to her mission. ``Doctors have advised her complete
rest.''
   Mother Teresa, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work
with the poor, suffered a heart attack on Sept. 5 and was
hospitalized at Woodlands Nursing Home.
   She was released on Oct. 14, but admitted again on Nov. 29 with
high blood pressure and dizziness. Surgeons implanted a pacemaker
on Dec. 1.
   Doctors attributed the illness to her hectic schedule at the
Missionaries of Charity. The Yugoslav-born nun founded the mission
in 1959 in an abandoned hostel donated by the city.

with the PLO. Is that the question?
   Q: Yes.
   A: No, they should not be. Jim Baker is working out a very
difficult formulation with the Israelis, with the Egyptians, under
which the representatives of Palestinian people would sit down and
talk. And it has been very difficult. Mubarak, you remember, had
his 10 points; Baker came up with five points. There has been
progress on that, incidentally, but I don't think it is the role of
the United States to force Israel to negotiate with the PLO. Yes,
sir?
   Q: Mr. President ... Can you envisage any steps the Chinese
government might take that would lead to the lifting of the
sanctions that are now in place?
   A: Yes, but I'm not going to detail them for you. The question
was can I envisage steps that the Chinese government can take that
would result in the lifting of the sanctions. Yes, and we have had
an opportunity to discuss that at very high levels in the Chinese _
in the Chinese hierarchy. And I _ I think it is important that they
know how we feel on this question as to _ as to what changes need
to take place. But let me reiterate, there has not been
normalization of relations because Gen. Scowcroft, at my request _
and it was my idea, my _ (laughing) _ my suggestion _ went over
there and had very high level talks in China. Who had it over here?
Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, could you discuss the question of German
reunification, particularly what steps need to be taken
internationally to deal with that question _ the Helsinki
conference, possibly a second one; possibly a peace conference to
settle borders? If you would _
   A: Well, I think the Helsinki agreement speaks to the question
of borders, and it does provide for peaceful change, but it mainly
recognizes existing borders, and that is a given, that is a
position that we respect and that we support. What we are not _ I
think it's very important that the United States not appear to be
trying to accelerate the change in Germany, that we not be out
setting timetables or suggesting how fast this question _ very
difficult question for some _ of German reunification be addressed.
And so, what we've done is simply let the process go forward.
   We _ I _ look, I haven't been able to predict the rapidity of
change in Eastern Germany. And if you find somebody that has,
please let me know who that clairvoyant so-and-so is, because I
don't think there is anybody that has been totally right. But, we
put on the table _ and I don't have them with me _ four points that
should guide the question of German reunification, but it is not _
it is one that is highly sensitive to the Soviet Union. And we
don't have to do it just their way. It is of some concern to some
of our European allies. But the NATO position and the position at
Helsinki guide the US view still on German reunification. Yes?
   Q: Just one follow-up to that. Chancellor Kohl has made the
point that Helsinki solves it only in a political context, and you
need a peace treaty to deal with the border question in
international law.
   A: Well, eventually I think that you can _ we can address
ourselves to that question. As you know, you have the Four Power
occupying provisions. But, I don't think that it's in our interest
to be setting dates for the finalization of this.
   Secretary Baker is discussing that at this very minute with our
various friends abroad. But the thing _ and I don't want to come
out looking like I oppose change from the status quo in the GDR,
but I just don't want to be in the position of trying to accelerate
the question of German reunification. It's too sensitive, and it's
not the role for the United States to do that. Sir? And then you,
I'm sorry.

<HEAD>Drama in the Kremlin: A Tough Weekend For Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An infuriated Mikhail S. Gorbachev clashed with
Communist Party conservatives at a tense, 10-hour Central Committee
meeting that included an especially harsh personal attack,
according to accounts surfacing Monday.
   When the doors opened Saturday, however, the 58-year-old Kremlin
leader emerged ``in excellent shape,'' a participant said, with his
stature reinforced with yet another party post, and even the
conservatives conceded that there were no alternatives to his
reforms.
   There was high drama at the plenary session of the party's
250-member Central Committee, with party officials reportedly
objecting to everything from the excesses of glasnost to
Gorbachev's kowtowing to the West. At one point, Gorbachev even
threatened to resign.
   ``Nobody argued against perestroika as the only policy capable
of leading the country and society out of the difficult situation
where they are now,'' said one Central Committee member, who on
condition of not being identified by name gave a richly detailed
account of the strife at the Kremlin.
   Despite glasnost, the openness policy instituted under
Gorbachev, proceedings in the Central Committee are cloaked in
secrecy. But some members did talk about the session, which even by
party ideologue Vadim A. Medvedev's account was peppered with
``dogmatic and conservative'' criticism.
   The critics' argument was that ``foreign countries are praising
us for perestroika, consequently, our way is wrong,'' Estonian
Premier Indrik Toome, a reformer, told his Baltic republic's youth
daily Noorte Haal.
   The policy-making body convened at a time of unprecedented
pressure on the party, with Lithuania two days earlier revoking its
constitutional monopoly on power. Gorbachev warned Communists their
comrades' ouster in Eastern Europe shows they must act quickly to
solve Soviet woes.
   ``The truth, about which we spoke so often in the past years,
has been reaffirmed once again _ where there is a delay in dealing
with overripe problems, excesses are inevitable,'' Gorbachev said
in remarks reported by Tass.
   But the Central Committee member, an avowed conservative, said
high-ranking party officials criticized a purported surge of
pacifism and the Soviet leader's foreign trips aimed at reducing
East-West tensions.
   The source said that at one point, the balding 59-year-old party
leader from the Siberian region of Kemerovo, Alexander G. Melnikov,
``carried away by emotions, said something like this: `Is it a
proper thing to go bowing to the capitalists? To go asking for a
blessing from the pope?'''
   ``It touched Gorbachev on the raw,'' the source said.
   Visibly infuriated, the Soviet leader interrupted Melnikov and
reportedly said: ``Just a minute. We in the Politburo think our
policy is justified. But if the Central Committee has another
opinion, you are welcome to express it, and then we'll decide if we
should resign or not.''
   Immediately, the source said, speakers took the floor in favor
of Gorbachev and the 12-member Politburo ``and the incident was
exhausted.'' Later, he said, Melnikov apologized for ``a slip of
the tongue.''
   Toome, quoted in Sunday' Noorte Haal, said Gorbachev told the
Central Committee ``he did not care about remaining in power'' and
that his reforms were for the good of Soviets, not foreigners.
   ``If you really think like that, let's discuss it,'' Toome
quoted Gorbachev as telling critics. Toome's remarks in the paper
were read over the phone by Hirv Elmar of the Estonian People's
Front in Tallinn.
   Gorbachev ally Ivan T. Frolov, editor of Pravda and a newly
appointed secretary of the Central Committee, said the Soviet
leader did not make a serious offer to resign, but merely employed
``an oratorical method.''
   Reaffirming his support for perestroika, Gorbachev ``definitely
and emphatically indicated the solidness of this line and his
personal devotion to it, and very sharply said this was the only
line for him,'' Frolov said.
   ``Can you interpret this as actually posing a question about his
resignation?'' Frolov asked.
   Gorbachev emerged reinforced from the meeting, adding to his
posts of party general secretary and Soviet president the newly
created job of Communist Party chief for the Russian federation.
All votes at the meeting, except one, were unanimous, the Central
Committee source said.
   Rank-and-file Communists rallied in Leningrad three days before
the plenum to support Gorbachev against what they predicted would
be a bid by hard-liners to oust him. The committee member said some
sort of attempt at calling Gorbachev to account may have been in
the works, but that he staved it off.
   ``I was ready for a shakeup,'' the official recalled. ``In the
beginning, there was really a tense moment when, in discussing the
agenda, Vladimir Karpov (first secretary of the Writers Union)
suggested including the current situation in the country.''
   That would have turned the plenum into a tribunal passing
judgment on perestroika. But the Central Committee member said
Gorbachev shortcircuited the proposal:
   ``Immediately, it alerted everyone, as if something really big
was going to happen and Karpov was no more than a pawn in someone
else's game. But at that very moment, Gorbachev put the motion to a
vote, saying: `Don't these questions we are going to discuss
embrace the current situation?'''
   Only Karpov voted in favor, the source said. ``That put everyone
at ease, and the plenum proceeded as planned,'' he said.
   Other party chieftains, including Leningrad's Boris Gidaspov,
criticized the Politburo for reacting slowly to events, the greater
openness in Soviet society or Kremlin's failure to stem
pro-independence movements in the Baltic and ethnic clashes and
separatist drives in the Caucasus, the source said.
   Toome told Noorte Haal ``about 30 people'' in the Central
Committee want Gorbachev removed, but said there was no talk
Saturday of replacing him. Interviewed after the plenum, he said
Gorbachev was unbowed by conservative criticism.
   ``The general secretary and president is in excellent shape,''
Toome said. ``It is evident he will not give up in favor of the
opposition. He has not used all his artillery yet.''

<HEAD>Marine Procurement Fraud Trial Opens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense consultant Thomas Muldoon and a
former corporate executive went on trial Monday on charges of
conspiring to bribe a Marine Corps procurement officer to help a
private company get Pentagon contracts.
   The trial is the second since the government's investigation of
Pentagon procurement fraud, nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind,''
became public 18 months ago. More than 25 individuals and four
corporations have been convicted.
   Muldoon, described in court papers throughout the government
investigation of defense procurement fraud as a major figure in the
case, is accused along with Leonard L. Ingram of participating in
the scheme to bribe former Marine Corps official Jack Sherman.
   ``This is a case about bribery and corruption,'' prosecutor
Robert DeHenzel told federal court jurors. ``Thomas Muldoon and
Leonard Ingram were involved in a six-year pattern of making
payments to Jack Sherman.''
   DeHenzel said that in return for receiving more than $80,000
over the six-year period Sherman helped Lee Telecommunications
obtain Marine Corps electronics contracts.
   In addition Sherman would modify the contracts to increase their
value to the company, which became a subsidiary of the Whittaker
Corp. in 1986.
   Sherman, who has pleaded guilty to separate charges in the
investigation, is expected to testify as a government witness.
   Ingram, a minority stockholder in Lee Telecommunications,
opposed the scheme to bribe Sherman, argued his lawyer, Marcus
Topel.
   When Ingram protested to company officials, ``he was told to
mind his own business,'' Topel told jurors.
   On several occasions, Topel argued, Ingram appeared to support
the scheme in discussions with defense consultants who served as
conduits for the payments to Sherman, but Ingram privately opposed
the payments in meetings with company officials, Topel said.
   ``He is not guilty of the offenses,'' Topel said. ``He is an
innocent man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
   Topel described Sherman as being as ``crooked as the Mississippi
River.''
   ``He is on the take everywhere,'' the defense lawyer said.
   Topel said that Scott M. Lamberth and John Franklin Van Tassel,
both former corporate executives, were prepared to testify that
Ingram was not involved in the bribery scheme. Both men have
pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing by U.S. District Judge
Claude M. Hilton.
   If convicted, Muldoon could receive up to 70 years in prison and
be fined as much as $1.04 million. Ingram could receive a 95-year
sentence and be fined up to $1.53 million if convicted of the
charges.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President ... I was interested in your observation about
Chinese missiles, and I wondered what makes that different? The
Chinese for years, when we were so concerned about the missiles at
the Strait of Hormuz, were denying that they had sent missiles to
anybody. Why is this substantively different? And why is it
suddenly important now?
   A: Well, because we've represented, sir, that they ought not to
be selling missiles into the unstable Middle East. And for this to
have been raised now and then having this instant response, I view
that as good.
   Q: But they've said that before.
   A: Well, if they proved to not be telling the truth, that
wouldn't be good. But _ so, I think _ you say what's different
about it? I think the fact that it was raised and then responded to
with this rapidity is a good sign. There are many issues of
difference that we have with the Chinese _ or potential difference.
And so, I think that one does not address itself to human rights in
China, but I think it's important. I think it's important that a
top U.S. official sat down with China; 24 hours later, we were told
this. And, you know, if it works out badly, why, it wouldn't be
productive. Yes, Ma'am?
   Q: At a time when a powerful individual such as Alfred
Herrhausen can be killed by terrorists, doesn't it seem extremely
risky to be attending the drug summit in Colombia? I wonder if
you've reconsidered attending?
   A: Well, I _ I'm going to take a look at that situation, but we
got a courageous president in Mr. Virgilio Barco, and I don't know
that _ well, I'll put it this way: I don't want to send some signal
that Virgilio Barco cannot provide the proper security for three
heads of state visiting his country. I don't want to undermine the
courageous stance he's taking by my taking a view that would hurt
what he's trying to do. And I'm sure that if he _ if the security
concerns are raised to him, that we have a long time before the
meeting, but near the time of the meeting he would agree with the
objective assessments.
   But right now I'm very hopeful that the meeting will take place
in Cartagena. And I have so much respect for him, and I know the
enormous problem he's under from people that want him to give up
the fight on extradition, or fight against the narco traffickers.
And I don't want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody
should go to Colombia because they can't be protected. So I've got
time to take a final decision on that.
   I will listen to the experts. I will not do anything imprudent.
Nobody has ever accused me of being too daring _ (laughter) _ and
so I will _ but I don't want to send _ I don't want to undermine
this courageous leader. Sir?
   Q: Mr. President ... I was wondering, in terms of the German
question, whether you could give us a better, more detailed sense
of your discussions with President Gorbachev on that matter? And
also what type of steps the United States, with or without the
Soviet Union, can take to prevent that situation from kind of
reaching _ the type of situation you seem to be concerned about now?
   A: How the U.S. can affect that?
   Q: How the U.S. could do it by itself or if there's a need for
the U.S. and the Soviet Union to work jointly.
   A: Well, one thing you do is keep from doing imprudent things.
There was a while when I was being criticized for not waxing
enthusiastic enough. Some even suggested that it would be
appropriate for the president to rush over to the Berlin Wall to
show his excitement. I was excited, but I thought it would be
foolish to go to the Berlin Wall, because you could _ you could
evoke a response that would be _ could have been totally
counterproductive.
   But this is the kind of subject that we can discuss with the
head of the Soviet Union, but it's not going to be determined
between Bush and Gorbachev. Now that's the kind of the spirit
that's in the past, that he and I would sit down and try to
determine the fate of Germany. That is not the role that I'm going
to play. That's not the role for the President of the United States.
   And so we will watch the procedures. We'll have the talks that
you've read about in the last couple of days, these four-power
talks at an ambassadorial level. We will stay in touch so we don't
miss a signal of some sort. But this is a matter for the German
people to decide. It isn't a matter that's going to be determined
by the United States. And so that's the way I look at it and that's
the way our policy is being conducted now. Yes, sir?

   Q: ... Mr. President, I think it can be said, and I think most
people agree, that the events of the last year indicate that the
Cold War has been going our way. Can we say the same thing about
the economic competition that we've had overseas? And given the
events that have unfolded in the last few months, is your
administration now going to put more focus on the latter rather
than the former?
   A: Well, I don't know about more focus, but we're going to put
plenty of focus on it, because you raise a very important question
_ the question of fairness in trade. And we have tried, through a
very tough and honest negotiator, our trade representative, Carla
Hills, to make the point that if we're going to go forward with
these trade relationships, we've got to be _ they have to be fair _
fair trade. I have made the point on several occasions to Mr.
Delors in the EC and to our trading partners in various settings
with our European friends that the American people are properly
insisting that the barriers come down.
   I remain committed to free trade, but it's got to be fair. And I
do think we can do a better job of showing our concern about that.
And I'm going to try to resist protectionist legislation when it
comes down the pike _ pure protectionist _ but the way to avoid it
is for us to make more progress in the negotiations.
   So I think you'll see a heightened attention to trade matters.
I'm going to avoid bashing some trading partner, popular though
that might be in the political arena. I think it's bad foreign
policy, and I think it's bad for the United States as a whole. But
I am not sanguine, I am not relaxed about where we stand, and I
will fight hard to have our people _ Secretary of Agriculture,
USTR, Secretary of Commerce _ make progress in all these forums on
international trade.
   I hope that the political changes continue around the world,
thus lessening tensions, so that we can put a lot more attention on
the trade sector. I don't want to reply to that part of your
question that I think that things are so good in terms of the
change in Eastern Europe or changes with the Soviet Union that we
can totally relax. I know they're not that good with China, for
example. Yes, sir?
   Q: ... Mr. President are you not concerned that your warming
relationship with China may send the wrong signal to the Kremlin
about future possible repression of the unrest?
   A: No, I have no concern about that at all, as long as we are
positioned in favor of human rights and against totalitarian
oppression. And I think we are properly positioned. But we have _
as China is a billion-plus people, they have a strategic position
in the world that remains important to us.
   And I'd like to think that they will redress some of the
grievances that continue to exist. And as long as Soviet Union
knows that we're not sending a signal of, quote, ``total
normalization,'' unquote, I think there's no risk in what you're _
in your question. But I will be very careful that we don't send
that signal. And I think, given the recent meeting with Mr.
Gorbachev, I think it's very little likelihood of that
misunderstanding cropping up. Sir?
   Q: ... As you know, we've just had a very close election in
Virginia. And the Democratic candidate we think has won _ we have
to wait for a recount on that _ by a very narrow margin. And some
say that he won primarily because of the Republican candidate's
rigid opposition to abortion. Many Democrats are very gleeful over
the fact also that as the Berlin Wall collapses, so will the
Republican party, because anti-communism has been the fuel that
kept the party moving all these years. My question to you, as
leader of the Republican Party, are you losing any sleep these days
over the future of your party?
   A: No, none at all. And I've read some of that balderdash out
there. (Laughter). The Democrats hold a seat, hold a gubernatorial
seat, and they dance around the grave of what they hope is the
Republican Party. And they're wrong, because the American people
have not changed their fundamental views that had them support me
over my opponent.
   And so I, you know, these elections come and go. The Virginia
election was a Democrat holding the seat of another Democrat. So, I
don't see enormous amount to rejoice in that, nor do I see a
turning down of the Republican Party because a mayor in New York
wins by 2 percentage points over a Republican. The story is _
please write it down _ that a Republican got 48 percent of the vote
in New York City. And so I don't _ I don't accept all that. And I
know there's a lively debate on some of these social issues. But, I
also know that we are getting credit as a party for handling, I
hope properly, some of the changes that are taking place in the
world. And having a global vision, and trying to do at home those
things that the American people want. I cited some of my
frustrations, but I also cited some steps that have gone reasonably
well. But I think we have a sound agenda, a national agenda, and I
think that will benefit the party in the future. So, for those who
want to read something into Virginians holding onto the
gubernatorial seat, that's their pleasure. But, I haven't lost a
wink, really. Yes?

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
cautioned West German leaders Monday that they alone cannot decide
the pace of reunification with East Germany.
   Baker flew here for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and a visit to the
now-porous Berlin Wall after a stop in London.
   There he reaffirmed a special U.S. relationship with the
government of Prime Minister Marager Thatcher and said he did not
believe the two close allies were drifting apart.
   ``I don't think there are any fences that need mending,'' Baker
said after a 50-minute conversation with Mrs. Thatcher at No. 10
Downing St. ``We feel a special relation to the United Kingdom and
to the prime minister.''
   He said there had been ``some minsuderstanding'' of President
Bush's call at a meeting of NATO leaders on Dec. 4 in Brussels for
``perhaps even an intensified effort'' at economic and political
integration of Western Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher has resisted most moves in that direction, but
gone along reluctantly. Overriding her objections, the European
Community on Saturday made steps toward creating a central bank and
a common currency for the 12-nation region.
   ``I don't think the differences were as real as they were
portrayed in the British press,'' Baker told reporters later as he
flew to West Berlin.
   Besides, he said the United States does not take a position on
the pace of integration because it is not a member of the European
Community.
   But Baker then went on to offer some pointed advice to Kohl,
whose 10-point program for German reunification has raised concerns
in the Soviet Union, France, Britain, Poland and elsewhere in
Europe.
   Baker said the four World War II allies who have final say in
running Berlin have ``roles and responsibilities'' that must be
respected in deciding the country's destiny.
   ``There has never been any peace treaty signed between the
allies and Germany, and there are certain retained rights which the
four powers have,'' Baker told reporters.
   He cited as an example access to Berlin by the four wartime
powers: the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France. In
that regard, Baker recalled former President Ronald Reagan's call
for improved air service.
   ``So there are some reserve roles and responsibilities there,''
Baker said.
   Asked if the Germans would require the concurrence of the four
powers to reunite the country, Baker said that was a legal question
that would keep U.S. and other foreign ministries busy.
   But when asked for the U.S. policy position, he said ``There is
a certain reserved role and certain responsibilities reserved under
the allied powers that have got to be considered when you deal with
the question of German reunification. These things have to be
considered and dealt with.''
   Baker will have breakfast with Kohl on Tuesday, ceremonially
sign the city's Golden Book, and make a low-key visit to the Berlin
Wall, the concrete Cold War symbol of East-West division.
   Millions of East Germans have passed through the wall in the
month since the Communist government lifted travel restrictions.
   Baker then will make a speech to the Berlin press club in which
he is expected to elaborate on his theme that German reunification
should be anchored to the North Atlantic Treaty Organiyation, the
European Community and the 1975 Helsinki Agreement signed by 32
European countries, the United States, Canada and the Vatican.
   He said the Bush administration would like to see reunification
develop in a peaceful and productive way
   ``Working together with all of our allies, and that includes the
Federal Republic of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, and
taking into consideration the concerns of Germany's neighbors, we
can have influence on the process,'' Baker said.
   He agreed with a reporter's suggestion that the upheaval in East
Germany comes partly from the streets and may not be manageable by
the superpowers.
   ``But we are doing, I think, what we should be doing, and what
is responsible under the circumstances.'' Baker said.

   A Kankakee County Board member was charged
Monday with murder and arson in the deaths of his three children
and a fourth youngster in a fire at their mother's home,
authorities said.
   Bernon I. Howery, 38, in his second term on the board, was
ordered held without bond on four charges of first-degree murder
and one of aggravated arson, Police Chief Timothy O. Nugent said.
   During questioning, ``Mr. Howery implicated himself in the cause
of this fire,'' Nugent said, declining to elaborate.
   The case is to go to a grand jury Friday, said Assistant State's
Attorney Brenda Gorski. Howery is scheduled for arraignment Dec. 18.
   The bodies of Justina Howery, 5; her sister, Prima, 10; their
brother, Joel, 9; and half-sister Ledonja Walls, 11, were found
early Saturday in an upstairs closet a short time after fire
engulfed their mother's home in this community of 31,000 about 60
miles south of Chicago.
   The fire appeared to have been started in piles of clothes
placed at several locations in the house, according to police Lt.
William Cantrell.
   Fire Chief James Dupuis said investigators were still trying to
determine if an accelerant had been used.
   All four children were left Friday evening by their mother,
Linda Walls, in the care of her 27-year-old brother, Johnny Walls,
who lives with her and the children, Cantrell said.
   Later in the evening, Howery visited and Walls left, Cantrell
said. Later, Howery also left to run an errand, leaving the
children unattended, Cantrell said.
   Authorities believe the fire was started before Howery departed,
Nugent said.
   Firefighters found no sign of a smoke detector in the house, and
considered it odd that the children had not broken an outside
window in the walk-in closet where their bodies were found,
Cantrell said.
   ``Breaking the window would have saved their lives,'' he said.
   Authorities backed off Sunday from their allegations that two of
the children may have been sexually molested before they died.
   Kankakee County Coroner James Orrison said autopsies gave no
indication of sexual molestation. He said high levels of carbon
monoxide found in the children's blood confirmed earlier
speculation that the victims were alive at the time the fire
started, and died of smoke inhalation.

   Sequoia and Kings Canyon
national parks, which adjoin each other in the Sierra, are the
first to resume a policy of letting some lightning fires burn
themselves out, officials said Monday.
   A National Park Service policy to let selected fires burn
naturally was suspended last year following criticism over letting
wildfires get out of control in Yellowstone National Park.
   The suspension has been lifted only at Sequoia and Kings Canyon
following approval by Regional Director Lew Albert of a revised
fire management plan for the parks 200 miles north of Los Angeles,
said spokesman William Tweed.
   Based on an environmental assessment, Albert found that resuming
the policy would have no signficant environmental impact.
   Fires will be allowed to burn only within specific ranges of
temperature, wind speed and fuel moisture, Tweed said. Enough
firefighters must be on hand to put a fire out if necessary.
   ``The goal of the program is to perpetuate the role of natural
fire in park ecosystems without threatening public safety or
property,'' Tweed said in a statement.

<HEAD>Eight End Hunger Strike Over El Salvador Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight hunger strikers protesting U.S.
military aid to El Salvador said Monday they had ended the fast
they began Thanksgiving Day at the Cathedral of St. Paul.
   ``The hunger strike was something that just a few people could
participate in,'' said Rene Hurtado, a Salvadoran refugee leading
the protest. ``By ending the hunger strike, we are allowing
everybody to participate with us in fighting to stop military aid
to El Salvador.''
   Hurtado also said the group was persuaded partly by pleas from
Gov. Rudy Perpich, U.S. House Speaker Thomas Foley and U.S. Rep.
Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.
   Doctors had said the strikers were entering a critical period
that would greatly stress their systems.
   On Sunday, Perpich and Sikorski attended a nondemoninational
prayer vigil at the church that drew more than 3,000 participants,
organizers said.
   Perpich said the fast should be suspended until Congress acts on
the issue. Sikorski said the strikers' strengths were needed to
continue working toward resolving the issue.
   Foley had called the strikers Friday, urging them to end their
fast, and promised that military aid to El Salvador would be a
major issue when Congress reconvenes next month.
   The hunger strikers included three refugees from El Salvador.
Another is from Guatemala, one is from Bolivia and three are from
the United States, including a Maryknoll priest.
   Their water-only fast began shortly after the murder of six
Jesuit priests in El Salvador last month. The fasters had said they
would die in the cathedral unless their demands were met.
   But in a joint statement Monday, the eight said they ``have seen
a serious response from political and religious leaders, along with
a tremendous outpouring of support from Minnesotans and others
throughout the country.''
   ``The voiceless are making their voices heard,'' they said.
   Church officials had said the strikers could remain in the
cathedral as long as other church services and activities were not
disrupted.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ... really. Yes?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President ... In your inaugural address, you called for a
higher level of cooperation between the Executive and Legislative
branches. And I was wondering, in the past year _ I realize the
House leadership had some unexpected turmoil _ but have you been
pleased, distressed, surprised by the character of White
House-Capitol Hill relations?
   A: Well, being somewhat of a realist, I can't say I was
surprised, but _ and there have been some negative, highly partisan
comments. I pride myself on the fact that I don't believe anybody
can point to a personal observation on the negative side by me
about any of the Democratic leaders, and I'm going to continue that
way. And I try to debrief them when we come back from Malta; I try
to give them a preview and ask for their advice before I go to
Malta; we talk about these domestic issues in a very open way with
the leaders _ and I'm going to continue that.
   And I think in some ways, that's been good _ I've taken some
flack on board from some in our own party for doing that too much,
for trying to work with the Democrats. But I was elected to make
certain things happen, and I'm going to continue to try to make
certain things happen. I cited an unfulfilled agenda here. But I _
if I had to sum up my feelings at the end of the year, I'd say
there are some frustrations, but I'm determined, when the Congress
comes back, to hold out the hand and try again. We have good
relationships with the Speaker, and the Senate side, reasonably
good. And so, we're going _ we're going to keep working on that.
But it _ there've been some good moments and there've been some
enormous frustrations, I guess is the way to wrap it up. Yes, sir?
   Q: Mr. President ... How likely is it for Jennifer Casolo to
receive a fair trial in El Salvador, given the breakdown of law and
order in that country, and also given the initial remarks that came
out of the White House when she was arrested?
   A: Well, I think it's essential that she receive a fair trial.
And I have instructed our ambassador, and indeed talked to
Cristiani personally, to represent to the Salvadorans that it's
essential that a fair trial be granted. And having said that, I am
satisfied so far that that will take place. But it is essential
that it not only take place but that it have all the appearances of
fairness, and I think that's what Mr. Cristiani is determined to
do. So I don't _ that one is _ is _ is very complex, but so far
I've seen no indication that she will not receive a fair trial.
   I have expressed my own concern about the FMLN shooting up
civilians and shooting up _ going after a democratically-elected
government that was elected in certifiably free elections. And I
think when Oscar Arias calls and urges that the Soviets intervene
to see that this kind of thing doesn't go on, it makes an
impression on me. But we ought to separate these cases, and just do
everything we can to insist that, whoever it is, be granted a fair
_ fair hearing and a fair trial. And I hope that will be the case
in Jennifer Casolo. Yes, sir?
   Q: ... Cincinnati being the home of Marvin Warner and Charles
Keating, we've got quite an interest in the S&amp;L crisis. You
mentioned in your remarks that you saw the fact that the S&amp;L
package guaranteed depositors their money as being a positive.
However, some are suggesting that the fact that that maximum level
of insurance is so high it's part of the problem, and I was just
wondering what your thoughts were on that.
   A: On deposit insurance?
   Q: The maximium level of insurance, $100,000 on depositors
insurance, being part of the reason for some of the problems with
Lincoln Savings and so forth.
   A: I _ I just _ I don't want to dodge your question, but I don't
know enough about the specifics in that case to give you an opinion
as to whether the $100,000 limit on savings deposits affected it or
not. All I do know is we've got to clean it up and it's a whale of
a _ a whale of a mess, and we'll see where we go. But we had this
one refinancing. I am now told that that might not be enough. And
whether you can attribute it to your question or now, I am
embarrassed to say I just don't have a good answer for you. Yes,
sir, way in the back.

   A man charged with murdering 27 people in
a bus crash hadn't been drinking heavily the day of the accident,
relatives and a friend testified Monday as the defense opened its
case.
   Also testifying was Kentucky Fire Marshal John William Martin,
who said a smoky fire that engulfed the church bus still would have
occurred if the vehicle had been equipped with a protective cage
around its gas tank.
   The defense maintains that Larry Mahoney was not drunk when his
pickup slammed into the bus on May 14, 1988, and that the 27
victims were killed because the bus was unsafe.
   Mahoney admits drinking the day of the crash, driving on the
wrong side of Interstate 71 and striking the loaded church bus. He
is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving.
   Defense attorney William Summers asked Martin if a protective
cage around the gas tank might have prevented the fire that
followed the crash. Police say the gas tank was punctured by a
piece of the bus' front suspension after the collision.
   ``It's my opinion it would not have prevented the puncture in
this case,'' Martin said.
   The fire marshal also testified that plastic seat covers and
cushions in the bus were combustible, but later added that the
smoke that filled the bus might have come from the burning gasoline
alone.
   The former school bus, built in 1977 before more stringent
federal safety standards went into effect, had been sold as surplus
to the First Assembly of God church.
   Following the crash, Martin issued a report recommending that
new school buses be designed with diesel engines, additional
emergency escape doors and windows, and with gas tanks in the
center, rather than on the side.
   The defendant's mother, son and best friend followed Martin to
the witness stand, all testifying that Mahoney was not drunk when
they saw him the day of the accident, which occurred just before 11
p.m.
   Anthony Mahoney, 17, testified that he didn't see his father
drink, nor did he seem intoxicated when he left their trailer at
about 1 p.m.
   Mary Mahoney said her son wasn't drunk, and didn't consume any
alcohol, when he visited her at about 4:30 p.m.
   Mahoney's best friend, Dennis Mefford, testified that he thought
Mahoney had been drinking but was not intoxicated when he visited
Mefford's house at about 6:30 p.m.
   Mefford described Mahoney as a moderate drinker who finds that
hard liquor bothers his stomach. He said Mahoney drank one can of
beer while eating pizza, and then left with another can.
   The defense is expected to complete its phase of the trial by
Friday. It remained uncertain whether Mahoney would testify.

<TEXT>
   Students have turned the tables on
the secret police and are keeping 24-hour watch on state security
headquarters.
   Three students hovered close to the entrance of the police
headquarters on Bartolomejska Street on Monday, serving their time
on the front lines in a psychological war against the despised
security force.
   For decades the shadowy force, known as the STB, threatened,
blackmailed and used every means imaginable to control and silence
citizens.
   A network of vicious spies and informers, the STB wove a web of
phone taps and bugs and cameras set up on street corners throughout
Prague.
   But everything in Czechoslovakia has suddenly been turned upside
down, and those who not long ago were behind bars as dissidents are
now leading the nation as ministers.
   Jiri Dienstbier and Jan Carnogursky, two former dissidents, on
Sunday became members of the cabinet and Carnogursky joined a
three-man commission overseeing the police. Once interrogated, they
now will have some questions of their own.
   Student leaders warn that when the locked drawers are finally
opened, thousands of incriminating files may be missing.
   In the Moravian town of Brno, students began keeping an eye on
police Friday after accusing them of burning documents in a nearby
forest, a charge reported by the state news agency CTK.
   ``To say openly what they may be trying to do is the greatest
danger to a group that operates in secrecy,'' said student
spokeswoman Monica Bajerova. ``Every citizen will be watching.
   ``The surveillance in Brno and here is part of the pressure we
want to put on to keep the secret police under control,'' she said.
   But the police plead innocence.
   Jiri Bitcanek, chief of uniformed police for Central Bohemia,
denied in an interview with Western reporters that any documents
have been removed from his office. Trouble is, Bitcanek only took
the job four days ago. His predecessor abruptly found a new career.
   Bitcanek voluteered to interview in place of the head of secret
police. He said he did not know who was now head of the furtive
force since the former chief was removed last week.
   He confessed that morale among his comrades has hit a new low
and that the force is in shambles.
   ``You have to realize that this is a corps set up along military
lines and that right now we are not receiving any orders,'' he
said, while chanting from a small street demonstration drifted
through his office window.
   Bitcanek said police, especially secret police, were only
following orders from the Communist Party hierarchy. Now they're
being held responsible.
   ``I went down to talk to the students when they came on Friday.
They photographed me,'' Bitcanek complained. ``They were taking
pictures of every person who came in or out of our building.''
   ``I asked them to stop. I don't havu any guarantee that a
picture of a policeman in this emotionally charged, psychotic
atmosphere will not be used against the agent or his family,'' he
said.
   The police, who are estimated to number over 100,000, are just
the latest security force to come under citizen attack.
   On Dec. 2, the Communist Party disarmed its paramilitary force,
the People's Militia. On Dec. 7, Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek
gave his assurance to opposition leader Vaclev Havel that the army,
estimated by Western experts at 145,000, would never be used
against the citizens.
   Despite such assurances, many Czechoslovaks suffer the psychic
scars of the last 40 years and are finding it hard to shed their
fears.
   They remember philosopher Jan Patocka, the guiding spirit of the
human rights group Charter 77, who died after eight hours of police
interrogation 12 years ago.
   ``We are still nervous,'' said a 32-year-old writer who
requested he not be identified. ``Maybe we are demanding too much
too fast. Will the secret police stand for this?''
   A student in front of the station on Monday said they didn't
have any choice: ``Now it's not the Soviets, it is the people who
are here.''

   The first person to undergo a simultaneous
heart, liver and kidney transplant was placed back on a ventilator
after she developed a pancreas inflammation, hospital officials
said Monday.
   Cindy Martin, 26, of Archbald was in critical condition Monday
at Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Her condition was downgraded from serious over the weekend when
her pancreas became inflamed, a complication that doctors believe
is related to the Dec. 3 transplant operation, said hospital
spokeswoman Lisa Rossi.
   But doctors said her transplanted organs were functioning well.
   ``It is a temporary setback, but it seems to be getting
better,'' Ms. Rossi said.
   Mrs. Martin underwent a heart transplant in 1985 because of a
congenital condition, but suffered chronic rejection and eventually
developed hepatitis and kidney dysfunction.

   Q: ... It sometime seems that missing from your agenda _ I mean
from your comments today _ has been anything relating to the
problems of American cities, particularly the problems of urban
poverty. And it leads to an inclination to think that perhaps you
don't think these problems are amenable to a federal initiative. Is
that correct?
   A: No, that's incorrect. I though child care had a lot to do
with that. I thought the question of anti-crime legislation has a
lot to do with that, because those areas are the most severely
impacted, but I'm glad you raised it because it is totally
incorrect. Yes, sir. ... I also mentioned the creation of jobs.
That's very important to the inner cities. Yeah, go ahead.
   Q: ... As we await your next budget for next year, there is some
anxiety that there may be another round of cuts in human and
domestic services, for example, the Legal Services Corp., where you
recently offered a recess appointment for a new chairman. Can you
give us some assurances that the kinder, gentler administration
will have adequate funding for human services?
   A: I think you'll _ I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when
you take the overall budget and its concerns for city affairs, for
human affairs, whatever _
   Q: (Inaudible.)
   A: Well, I can't _ I don't know the exact levels on Legal
Services. We're in the final processes of budget right now. I go
from this meeting to another marvelous meeting with Dick Darman _
(laughter) _ and big, thick notebooks over there, so I am not
ducking it, I just don't know the answer. But generally speaking, I
think you're going to find that we are able to finance the
initiatives that I talked about _ some of which I mentioned here _
that do affect the human _ the welfare of the American people,
particularly those that are disadvantaged. Yeah? ... Last two. One,
two.
   Q: ... Mr. President. Could you tell us when a decision will be
announced on the relocation of the Southern Command in Panama?
   A: No, sir, I don't know _ I'm not ducking it, I just don't know
the answer. (Aside) Does anyone _ can anyone help with that? Bob?
   Staff: No, sir.
   A: Can't _ I know people in San Antonio have a keen interest in
this _
   Q: Yes, very keen.
   A: _ and I can understand why, but I just don't know the answer
to that one. Yes, last one.
   Q: ... There have been widely divergent accounts this morning of
the credibility of a witness to the murder of those priests in El
Salvador. Is it not time to go public with that investigation? And
if not now, when?
   A: A widening _ a widely _
   Q: We have a report _
   A: _ as to whether she's a credible witness or not?
   Q: Yes, we have a report out of El Salvador that she had flunked
lie detector tests. We have other reports from the clergy in El
Salvador that she's being brainwashed. Could you respond to that?
   A: Yeah, I can respond to the last part of it, and _ because
when I read that, I looked into that and I am _ and I am assured
that is not the case. But I think you're _ you ask a good question
as to when all this will become public; it should be, and I'd like
to see it as soon as possible. But there are some _ I think there
are some concerns and all I would say is that this _ she was
accompanied by a person from the U.S. Embassy. I believe the
Justice Department has had a _ had the custodianship or taken a
keen interest in all of this, and I have confidence that our
Attorney General would not permit the kind of inquisition process
that was alluded to in the papers today.
   And so it is very important, just as in the Casolo case, that
this be resolved fairly and to the satisfaction of the American
people. And that is going to mean the disclosure that you're _ that
you're asking about. And so I want to _ I want to just assure you
that this will _ this will take place. I think it's important that
it's done in a way so there's no _ you know _ not tampering with
evidence, but prejudicing the legal proceedings that are taking
place. I think that's very important.
   Q: Well, will you order the FBI to make its investigation public
in the reasonably near future?
   A: Well, I'll do it in _ within the confines of the legal
proceedings. I don't want to _ I don't want to order them to do
something and then have them say the very fact you've done this is
making it difficult to get a reasonable solution to the question
everybody is asking: What happened?
   But I think in fairness to her, I've already guaranteed to my
satisfaction that she is not being mishandled. And I don't think
that people would tell me something that's not true there because
there would be a price to pay for that.
   Thank you all very much. Thank you.

<HEAD>Sakharov Call for General Soviet Strike Appears to Fizzle</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gorbachev, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-hour general strike called by human rights
activist Andrei D. Sakharov appeared to fizzle Monday, with only
about 1,500 participants reported in Moscow and scattered support
around the country.
   Scientists at research institutes were the main workers in the
capital to heed the strike call to demand an end to Communist Party
domination, an aide to the Nobel Peace Prize laureate said.
   There was little exact information about strikes elsewhere, but
Sakharov aide Alexander Sobyanin said his office received about 100
telegrams from Soviet workplaces where walkouts took place and knew
of about 1,500 scientists who took part.
   Ivan T. Frolov, editor-in-chief of Pravda, said the strike
apparently ``didn't happen.''
   ``I think it would be hard to imagine that in these conditions,
after all we've lived through and are living through, that this
poorly thought-out strike call could meet understanding among the
public,'' he told a news conference at the party newspaper's
offices.
   Strikes have ravaged the struggling economy since summer, and
officials now warn that city-supplied steam heat could be affected
by a coal strike in an already bitter Russian winter.
   Sakharov and other parliamentarians called for the strike to
pressure the Congress of People's Deputies to vote on rescinding
Article 6 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Communists the
``leading and guiding role'' in society. They also want the
Congress, which opens Tuesday, to act on several key reform laws.
   Sakharov's move failed to win the support of a group of 400
progressive parliamentarians. The Inter-Regional Group voted Sunday
to favor the goal of rescinding Communist supremacy, but did not
throw its influence behind the call for a general strike. Members
said the public mood was too explosive.
   Random checks of factories in Moscow bore out Frolov's claim
that the strike failed to materialize.
   Sobyanin said despite the limited participation in the walkout,
a permanent Moscow strike committee was being formed in case the
need arose for a walkout.
   A highly successful two-hour strike Nov. 27 preceded
Czechoslovakia's recent decision to drop its version of Article 6
from its constitution, and Hungary, Poland and East Germany have
done away with their equivalents of the clause as one after the
other moved away from Communist one-party rule.
   In the Baltic republic of Latvia, some store clerks and
transport workers called a halt for just 15 minutes to show their
solidarity with Sakharov's call, said Maris Melans of the Popular
Front newspaper Atmoda.
   Lithuania's popular front, called Sajudis, saw no reason to
strike since its parliament voted last week to drop its version of
Article 6 and legalize a multiparty system, said spokesman
Gintautas Alyksenes. As a sign of solidarity with Sakharov's call,
however, Sajudis called for a minute of silence, he said.
   Estonia's Popular Front decided not to join the strike, even for
two hours, because ``we have such terrible economic conditions, it
would make people's lives worse,'' said spokesman Paul Lepp.
   Estonia's parliament is expected to follow Lithuania's example,
throwing out its version of Article 6 and legalizing multiple
political parties within a month, Lepp said.
   ``For all practical purposes, it's already removed,'' he said.
Although only the Democratic Party of Labor of Estonia called
itself a political party in Sunday's elections, many other
political movements fielded candidates, Lepp said.
   Soviet TV's nightly news program, ``Vremya,'' like other Soviet
media, carried nothing Monday on the strike.

<TEXT>
   Military officials said Monday that
hundreds of soldiers who launched the failed coup attempt are still
at large, and President Corazon Aquino called for tougher search
and arrest measures.
   Mrs. Aquino also said her government's position in talks on a
new lease for U.S. bases has not been compromised by the role U.S.
warplanes played in helping put down the rebellion that officials
say killed 113 people.
   Military officials said they cannot account for more than half
of the soldiers who launched the coup attempt Dec. 1 in the most
serious bid by troops to topple Mrs. Aquino. Rebels in Cebu City
surrendered their last known position to government forces Saturday.
   Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, chief of the military's Civil
Relations Service, said 1,485 rebel troops, including 128 officers,
have surrendered. The military estimates about 3,000 soldiers
joined the coup attempt, and the whereabouts of many rebels
remained unclear.
   Florendo said in addition to 113 deaths, the coup attempt left
581 people wounded.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino declared a nationwide state of
emergency to cope with the crisis. She said Monday she wanted
Congress to grant special powers to search for weapons and
ammunition without the normal legal constraints.
   She also said the administration would ask Congress to extend to
72 hours the length of time a suspect can be detained without
charge. The law requires that suspects be charged within 12 to 36
hours of arrest, depending on the severity of the crime.
   As a sign of concern, share prices tumbled 8 percent in nervous
trading on the Manila Stock Exchange on Monday, the first day of
trading since the coup attempt was launched.
   At a news conference, Mrs. Aquino was asked whether she was
considering a Cabinet shakeup after the coup attempt.
   ``I believe that by the end of the year we will already know who
we will probably change,'' she said.
   Mutineers had demanded that Mrs. Aquino and her government
resign in favor of a civilian-military junta. Many political
commentators also have urged changes in the Cabinet because of
inefficiency in government.
   Mrs. Aquino said the bases issue was not discussed when her
government asked the United States, through Ambassador Nicholas
Platt, to provide air cover for loyal forces.
   On Dec. 1, the first day of the coup attempt, U.S. F-4 Phantom
jets based in the U.S. Clark Air Base north of Manila provided air
cover for loyal troops fighting rebel forces who bombed the
Malacanang presidential palace and occupied three military bases.
   The talks on the future of the six U.S. military facilities in
the Philippines, whose lease expires in 1991, were set to begin
this month but are expected to start in January or February, Mrs.
Aquino said.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said at a separate news conference
that the flights by U.S. warplanes could have a positive effect on
the talks. He said the jets did not fire on rebel positions as
claimed by opposition politicians.
   ``In my view, the forthcoming exploratory talks between two
governments would be affected in a positive way by that giving of
assistance in a very well-defined manner _ nobody went out of
bounds,'' Ramos said.
   Also on Monday, opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said Mrs.
Aquino cannot prove she was elected president of the Philippines
and should resign.
   Enrile, the former defense minister, said Mrs. Aquino ``has no
evidence that she is the duly elected president of the Philippines.
... If there is anybody who should lead the resignation of national
officials of the land, it should be Mrs. Aquino.''
   Enrile's claim reflects the opinion of a clique of military
officers who triggered the February 1986 ``people power''
revolution against then-President Ferdinand Marcos but who then
turned against Mrs. Aquino and have tried to overthrow her.
   The 1986 uprising began after Enrile and military allies
mutinied against Marcos following a fraud-tainted presidential
election. No independent vote count was ever completed.
   Enrile said he would refuse to cooperate with a presidential
commission investigating whether he took part in the latest coup
attempt. He has denied involvement. He was fired as defense
minister on Nov. 26, 1986, after a failed coup by his followers.

<HEAD>AIDS, Crack and Homelessness Contribute to Rise in Foster Care</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homelessness, AIDS and crack cocaine are
overwhelming child welfare services nationwide and are contributing
to a growing number of children in foster care, a congressional
report said Monday.
   The report issued by the Democratic majority on the House Select
Committee on Children, Youth and Families said federal funding for
major children's services, especially those designed to keep
children in their homes, has not kept pace with the problem.
   ``This is Ronald Reagan's legacy to the 1990s,'' Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., committee chairman, said at a news conference.
``This was the prescription for the 1980s and it's been a complete
disaster.''
   Social workers cannot keep up with huge caseloads, and children
are being placed on waiting lists rather than given services, he
said.
   ``It means we are devastating hundreds of thousands of children
... These children are becoming candidates for long-term dependency
on our social welfare system,'' Miller said. ``We're really talking
here about he candidates' school for future penetentiary
residents.''
   The report estimates that the number of children placed in
foster care, juvenile detention centers and mental health
facilities has grown to nearly 500,000 and could reach 840,000 by
1995.
   The report said its survey of 11 large states showed the number
of children in foster care dropped by 9 percent between 1980 and
1985. However, the number rose 23 percent between 1985 and 1988,
while federal funding for child welfare services aimed at keeping
children in their homes rose 7 percent, according to the report.
   The number of children in public and private juvenile detention
centers rose 27 percent from 1979 to 1987, as funding under the
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act declined from $100
million in fiscal 1979 to $66.7 million in fiscal 1989, the report
said.
   The number of children in mental health facilities soared 60
percent between 1983 and 1986, the report said. Federal block
grants for mental health services provided $503 million to the
states in fiscal 1989, $17 million less than the sum of programs
consolidated into block grants in 1981, it said.
   The states surveyed were California, Florida, Illinois,
Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Texas.
   Among the reasons cited for the increases in foster placements
and detentions was drug and alcohol abuse. The number of babies
born ``drug-exposed'' reached 375,000 in 1988, a number that has
quadrupled in the last three years, the report said.
   It also said reports of abused or neglected children rose 82
percent to 2.2 million between 1981 and 1988. Also, requests for
shelter for homeless families rose 18 percent from 1987 to 1988,
said the report, citing a U.S. Conference of Mayors report.
   Republicans on the committee disputed the Democrats' projection
that out-of-home placements for children will jump 73 percent over
the next five years. They took issue with the report's methods of
calculating the projection and basing it on an 11-state survey.
   ``Our concern is that the numbers are so unreliable that the
message will be dismissed,'' their statement said.
   The dissenters said more nationwide information is needed on
adoption and foster care, and they blamed the states for some of
the problems in the system. Four different General Accounting
Office reports have shown states have failed to implement
procedures and protections established by the federal government to
protect children, they said.

<HEAD>Three Christian Militiamen Wounded in Highway Shootout with Army</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Christian militiamen were wounded
in a shootout with Gen. Michel Aoun's troops on a highway Monday,
sending commuters fleeing for cover and underscoring growing
friction between Christian forces.
   Police said the three wounded men belonged to Samir Geagea's
6,000-member Lebanese Forces, which favors an Arab League-brokered
peace plan to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   A quarrel developed over traffic rights in the afternoon rush
hour, police said. A Lebanese Forces jeep tried to overtake an army
patrol at the Death River intersection of the main coastal highway
in east Beirut.
   ``Militiamen in the jeep opened up with submachine guns at the
patrol. The soldiers retaliated by tossing a hand grenade that blew
up the jeep,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be identified
under standing rules.
   Hundreds of motorists in the bumper-to-bumper traffic panicked.
Many crashed into others' cars and then leaped out to duck for
cover, leaving their doors ajar, the spokesman said.
   It took traffic police half an hour to remove the three victims
to hospital and restore order on the highway, the spokesman added.
   ``The incident appeared spontaneous, but the underlying tension
between the two sides is unmistakable,'' the spokesman said.
   The Lebanese Forces and Aoun's army have been on a collision
course since the general rejected the Arab peace plan under which a
new president, Elias Hrawi, was elected Nov. 24. Aoun rejected the
plan for not specifying when Syrian troops would leave Lebanon.
   Hrawi has fired Aoun from all his posts. But the general is
holding out with 20,000 loyal troops in the presidential palace,
located in the Christian enclave.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are all Maronites, the Christian sect
that has dominated power in Lebanon since it gained independence
from France in 1943.
   Aoun has rejected Hrawi's presidency, calling him a ``Syrian
puppet'' because he was elected by Parliament in an area controlled
by the Syrian army in east Lebanon.
   The Syrians moved in reinforcements two weeks ago and have
threatened to evict Aoun by force from the Baabda place, five miles
east of Beirut. But tens of thousands of supporters have since
formed a human wall around the hilltop palace in a massive display
of pro-Aoun sentiment in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Geagea has declared his militia would fight alongside Aoun's
army if the enclave was attacked by the Syrians, who maintain
40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the
Arab League.
   But Geagea also made it plain in televised speeches to his
supporters that he recognizes Hrawi's legitimacy, always referring
to him as ``President Hrawi.''

<HEAD>Grand Jury Epected To Review 1963 Slaying Of Civil Rights Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury that convened Monday is
expected to make a preliminary examination of evidence in the 1963
slaying of civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
   However, Hinds County District Attorney Ed Peters has said he
expects no indictment by this grand jury in the Evers slaying.
Prosecutors say they are continuing to investigate the killing and
could present more evidence to a later grand jury.
   ``In fact that is probably what is going to happen,'' said
Assistant District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter. ``All we wanted to do
with this grand jury is advise them what has happened. It doesn't
mean we are quitting. We have to start somewhere, sometime, and
this is it.''
   Evers, field director of the Mississippi chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was shot to
death June 12, 1963, outside his Jackson home.
   White supremacist Byron De La Beckwith, a former Greenwood
fertilizer salesman, was tried twice in Hinds County Circuit Court
in 1964. Two all-white juries were unable to reach verdicts and the
charge was dropped.
   Newspaper reports on Oct. 1 said he state's defunct segregation
spy agency, the Sovereignty Commission, had screened potential
jurors for Beckwith's second trial to aid the defense. Beckwith now
lives in a suburb of Chattanooga, Tenn.
   The reports raised questions about jury tampering. However, Erle
Johnston of Forest, who served as executive director of the
commission during the time of Beckwith's trials, insisted that
there was no tampering.
   Representatives of the district attorney's office have since
talked to all but one or two of the jurors from the second trial.
DeLaughter would not say what the jurors said.
   DeLaughter and two investigators have examined records and
conducted interviews in the Evers case.
   ``For right now we have been focused on the second trial,''
DeLaughter said. ``There were no allegations concerning the first
trial.''
   The grand jury that convened Monday is expected to meet through
most of the week. Prosecutors declined to say when the Evers matter
might be discussed. The panel's proceedings will not be open to the
public.
   Evers' widow, Myrlie, met privately Friday with Peters and
DeLaughter for an hour-long briefing. She said she was not asked to
testify before the grand jury on her husband's slaying.
   ``I cannot tell you ... if I am satisfied with the actions of
that office because I have not seen enough,'' she said.
   ``I would simply hope that as the investigation goes on,
whatever happens, that justice be done ... that there will be
enough evidence to convict,'' Ms. Evers said.

   President Bush on Monday denied allegations
that U.S. officials had mistreated a Salvadoran witness who had
implicated the Salvadoran Army in the slayings of six Jesuit
priests last month.
   Bush also said he had told President Alfredo Cristiani of El
Salvador that a fair trail must be held for Jennifer Casolo, the
Connecticut church worker arrested after ammunition and explosives
were found buried in her yard in San Salvador.
   Salvadoran Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas had said on Sunday
that U.S. officials had resorted to ``psychological torment'' and
brainwashing in an effort to induce the woman, Luisa Cerna, to
retract her story.
   A lawyer for an association of American Jesuits, R. Scott
Greathead, said Ms. Cerna withdrew her statement implicating the
Army under pressure from her American and Salvadoran interrogators.
   Ms. Cerna, a housekeeper for the Jesuits, first said she saw
armed men dressed in military uniform enter the rectory of the
Central American University on Nov. 16, when the Jesuits were
killed. She was flown to Miami on Nov. 23 at her request and that
of the Spanish and French ambassadors in El Salvador.
   During a question-and-answer session with newspaper editors,
Bush said he checked into news accounts of the case and was assured
Ms. Cerna had not been mistreated.
   ``And I don't think that people would tell me something that's
not true there because there would be a price to pay for that,'' he
said.
   ``I have confidence that our Attorney General would not permit
the kind of inquisition process that was alluded to in the papers
today.''
   Some of those accounts said Ms. Cerna had failed lie detector
tests.
   Bush added that he expects that details of the case will be
released so long as they do not jeopardize the legal proceedings
now under way.
   On the Casolo case, Bush said, ``So far I have no received any
indictation that she will not receive a fair trial.''
   Some presidential spokesmen have suggested that the Salvadorqan
government had a case against the woman in view of the large
quantity of munitions dug up around her house on Nov. 26. Some
congressional Democrats have criticized those comments.
   Bush did not mention those exchanges. He said he had spoken to
both Cristiani and the U.S. ambassador, William Walker, ``to
represent to the Salvadorans that it's essential that a fair trial
be granted,'' and be seen to be fair.
   Ms. Casolo's associates and family insist she has been framed.
She is being held for 90 days during an investigation.
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher denied
the allegations that Ms. Cerna had been forced to recant
``absolutely and unequivocally.'' He said there have been ``many
misinformed and unsubstantiated statements'' that have served to
suggest that the U.S. government wants to discredit the witness's
testimony. ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said.
   Boucher said it appears the archbishop had not been given the
facts of the case, adding that the administration has a deep
commitment to uncover the truth.
   ``We are doing everything possible to help the Salvadorans find
the killers and bring them to justice,'' he said. ``We expect this
case to be investigated fully and promptly, and that those
implicated by the investigation will be prosecuted. We have made
this entirely clear to President Cristiani and to the armed
forces.''
   He said a State Department official witnessed all the
interviews, which were carried out by a U.S.-trained Salvadoran
special investigative unit and by agents of the FBI.
   At the conclusion of Ms. Cerna's questioning, she was turned
over to the Jesuits.
   During the time she was under U.S. government protection, the
church was given free access to her and never mentioned to U.S.
officials any allegation of mistreatment, he said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III sent a letter to
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani expressing concern over
reports of systematic mistreatment of American religious workers in
El Salvador.
   He asked Cristiani to give his personal attention to the welfare
of these workers.
   There have been reports that one such worker, Josephine Beecher,
was tortured recently by Salvadoran police. A group of religious
leaders said two weeks ago the U.S. government has not been
aggressive enough in preventing Salvadoran officials from engaging
in the reported abuses.

<HEAD>Iranian Urges Release of Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOHA, Qatar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has urged its ``friends'' in Lebanon to
free the Western hostages, a senior Iranian official said in an
interview published Monday.
   ``We have directed our advice to our friends in Lebanon to cease
their acts with respect to the kidnapping of the Western
hostages,'' the newspaper Al-Raya quoted Deputy Foreign Minister
Ali Mohammed Besharati as saying.
   ``But the problem is that every time the atmosphere becomes
propitious for the release of the hostages, there are
counterincidents that cloud the atmosphere,'' said Besharati, who
ended a two-day visit to this Persian Gulf nation on Sunday.
   The paper said he was referring to the kidnapping by Israeli
commandos of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem preacher from
south Lebanon, on July 28.
   On July 31, Shiite Moslem kidnappers of the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth said they killed their American hostage Lt. Col.
William Higgins in retaliation for the kidnapping.
   Most of the 18 hostages held in Lebanon are believed to be in
the hands of Iranian-backed Shiite groups. They are eight
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman
and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985 in west Beirut.
   The death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the election of the
more pragmatic President Hashemi Rafsanjani gave rise to some hopes
of Iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives.
   Before coming to Qatar, Besharati visited the United Arab
Emirates as part of Iran's active contacts with the conservative
Gulf Cooperation Council member states ahead of their annual summit
Dec. 18 in Oman.
   Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi
Arabia make up the council, which generally supports the policies
of Iraq, Iran's long-time enemy.
   Relations between Iran and the council states, with the
exception of Saudi Arabia, have been steadily improving since
Persian Iran accepted the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire to the
eight-year war with Arab Iraq.

   The captain of the USS Iowa said Monday that
he doesn't ``agree or disagree'' with the Navy's conclusion that
gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig likely caused an explosion that left
47 sailors dead, but he did say he thought the ship had been
sabotaged.
   ``I embraced that it was an intentional act,'' Capt. Fred
Moosally told reporters after his appearance before the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
   ``I cannot make the jump that it was absolutely Petty Officer
Hartwig. ... I don't think I can say that a definite individual did
it. He was a good gunner's mate.''
   Moosally, testifying publicly for the first time since the April
19 blast in the Caribbean, also softened previous statements _ made
under oath to Navy investigators _ that were sharply critical of
the Iowa crew's gun-firing capabilities.
   With Hartwig's mother and sister sitting nearby, he told the
committee, ``I don't agree or disagree'' with the finding that
Hartwig was responsible for the explosion in the No. 2 gun turret.
   Moosally, however, said he thought the ship had been sabotaged
because he didn't believe there could be any other explanation. He
was not testifying under oath Monday.
   Several members of Congress have questioned the Navy's official
findings.
   The Navy, in a Sept. 7 report, concluded that Hartwig ``most
likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Navy officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial
because all the witnesses, including Hartwig, were killed in the
blast.
   The service said the case against Hartwig was built largely on
circumstantial evidence drawn from forensic tests and a
psychological profile depicting him as a suicidal loner.
   Three FBI psychologists testified that they believed Hartwig
committed suicide, even though the agency's review of laboratory
tests proved inconclusive.
   Richard Ault of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Analysis
Program said there had been nothing in Naval Investigative Service
files to show that Hartwig had been ``a happy camper.'' However,
Ault said the bureau had no conclusive evidence that Hartwig blew
up the turret.
   Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and other members
interrogated Moosally closely on whether he shared the conclusions
of the naval investigative commission headed by Rear Adm. Richard
Milligan.
   ``You agree that it was a wrongful, intentional act?'' Nunn
asked.
   ``That's correct,'' the captain replied, `` ... based on my
observations on the procedures up there of loading that gun, and
that's the only conclusion I can come to.''
   But Moosally refused to agree with Sen. Alan Dixon's statement
that the Navy report blaming Hartwig was ``highly speculative.''
   ``I wouldn't make that statement,'' he said.
   Dixon, D-Ill., shot back that ``it strains the intelligence of
most people'' to conclude that the Navy had sufficient evidence to
hold Hartwig accountable for the explosion.
   Dixon asked Moosally if he thought the Navy was engaging in a
cover-up.
   ``I hope that's not the case,'' he replied. ``I don't believe it
is the case.''
   Evelyn Hartwig, the sailor's mother, walked up to Moosally after
his testimony and asked him if he thought her son had caused the
explosion.
   ``I looked him straight in the eye and asked him,'' she told
reporters later.
   Moosally told Hartwig's mother: ``He was a good gunner's mate.
Did I say your son did it? I didn't say that.'' He kissed Mrs.
Hartwig.
   Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, also was critical of
Moosally's testimony.
   ``I think somebody has gotten to him,'' she said. ``If he
doesn't think my brother did it, who does he believe did it?''
   When pressed during the hearing to say why he could not share
the Navy's conclusion, Moosally said it was because he put out to
sea shortly after the incident and had no access to the evidence.
   Moosally did acknowledge that his weapons department personnel
proceeded April 19 with an unauthorized firing in the No. 2 gun
turret involving five powder bags rather than the customary six.
   The initial explosion was caused by premature ignition of five
bags of smokeless powder contained within the center gun with the
breech dless to say, I open.
   ``Neewas disappointed in my subordinates for
pre-empting my command prerogative,'' he said, noting that they had
been punished.
   Moosally, also officially reprimanded after the incident,
steadfastly denied that the Iowa had become what Dixon called a
``floating laboratory.'' He said the Iowa resumed normal firings
within weeks of the explosion.
   ``I would not have ordered my men in there and I would not have
gone into the turret if I thought this thing could have happened
again,'' he said.
   Moosally told Milligan's commission he was concerned about the
capabilities of key Iowa crew members. He called a gunnery officer
``a basket case'' and said that a chief petty officer had to be
``kept in a box'' because of a$1.5793 late Friday. The pound
fetched $1.5937 in New York, up from $1.5825.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
quotes, included: 1.7610 West German marks, down from 1.7705;
1.5915 Swiss francs, down from 1.5970; 6.0200 French francs, down
from 6.0485; 1,301.00 Italian lire, down from 1,304.00; and 1.16375
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16225.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.7660 West
German marks, down from 1.7720; 1.5970 Swiss francs, down from
1.5985; 6.0370 French francs, down from 6.0565; 1.9950 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0000; 1,304.25 Italian lire, down from
1,306.50; and 1.1632 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1615.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $416.75 an ounce from
$411.55 Friday. In Zurich, it jumped to $415.75 an ounce from
$409.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 11 cents to close at $412.26 an
ounce.
   Silver prices also headed higher. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.692 a troy ounce, up 4.8
cents. Silver closed up 10 cents in London at $5.74 an ounce.

   The State Department expressed concern Monday
about rising tensions in Yugoslavia and urged the people to unite
in support of the reform efforts of Prime Minister Ante Markovic.
   ``Mutual respect, adherence to democratic principles, and a
commitment to avoiding violence are crucial to resolving this
situation,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   Tensions among Yugoslavia's loose federation of six republics
were exacerbated Monday when the leadership of the Communist
country's second-largest state _ Croatia _ called for the
establishment of a multiparty system.
   Until now the liberal northern state of Slovenia was the only
one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics to openly advocate
the introduction of Western-style democracy.
   Earlier this month Serbia, in an apparent move to stifle
burgeoning democratic trends in the country, severed all business
and official ties with Slovenia. The unprecedented action shook the
foundations of Yugoslavia's system.
   The United States supports ``a united federal Yugoslavia in
which human rights and civil rights of all citizens are
protected,'' Boucher said. ``The U.S. strongly supports the ongoing
efforts of Yugoslav Prime Minister Markovic to create a
market-based economy and to promote greater political pluralism.
   ``We urge all Yugoslavs to put aside their differences and to
focus their energies on this important reform effort,'' he said.

   Catalina Vasquez Villalpando took the oath of
office Monday as U.S. Treasurer, the official whose signature goes
on every bill.
   President Bush was on hand for the ceremony in the Indian Treaty
Room of the Old Executive Office Building, as were Ms.
Villalpando's parents, grandmother, three sisters and other
relatives.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady administered the oath, and
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, held the Bible.
   Ms. Villalpando, of San Marcos, Texas, is a former senior
executive of Communications International Inc., a
telecommunications company. She worked for President Reagan in
1983-85 as a special assistant for public liaison.
   She is also a past chairwoman of the Republican National
Hispanic Assembly.
   Bush called her a ``remarkable woman'' with a reputation as a
strong adminstrator.
   ``During her White House service, Cathy demonstrated outstanding
creativity in working on issues of direct importance to our
nation's Hispanic citizens,'' Bush said.
   Her duties include overseeing the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the U.S. Mint and the U.S. Savings Bond program, along
with putting her signature on U.S. currency. Brady's name also goes
on the bills.

   Communist Party chief Petar Mladenov
proposed Monday that Bulgaria, a fortress of Stalinism only weeks
ago, hold free elections in May and remove the party's guarantee of
exclusive power from the constitution.
   While the party Central Committee heard Mladenov, a Sofia court
registered Eco-Glasnost, an ecological group, as Bulgaria's first
independent organization.
   Mladenov said a new constitution should be drafted by the end of
next year, leaving out any guarantee of Communist Party power.
   ``One cannot postulate the role of party in a democratic society
or define it on command,'' he told the Central Committee. ``This
role can only be (won) as a result of the people's trust.''
   Party activities ``must be in harmony with the Constitution and
its laws,'' Mladenov said. ``We have to take practical steps to
separate the functions of the state and the party.''
   He recommended passage of a new electoral law and new rules ``on
gatherings, meetings and demonstrations, citizen's organizations
(and) religion.''
   Early elections are likely to favor the Communists. The growing
number of still-unregistered political, religious and ecological
groups were banned until recently and have had little time to
establish themselves.
   In a 90-minute speech to the Central Committee distributed by
the official news agency BTA, Mladenov said a special party
congress should be held March 26, state radio reported. The next
regular congress originally was scheduled for early 1991 but, then
moved up to late 1990.
   After the May elections, he said, Parliament should ``pass the
most important legislation on economic reform, including the law
over property and the law on land and use of land by the end of
1990.''
   He said he favored a ``socialist market economy,'' implying some
state ownership.
   Mladenov replaced Todor Zhivkov, party chief for 35 years, on
Nov. 10. As the Central Committee met Monday evening, thousands of
people with candles kept a silent vigil outside party headquarters.
   At least 10,000 gathered in the square behind the Central
Committee building, and organizers said it was to show party
leaders the people were watching their decisions.
   About 5,000 people had gathered in the square earlier Monday,
dispersing peacefully after an hour. Two more vigils are planned
Tuesday.
   More than 50,000 people rallied in downtown Sofia on Sunday,
demanding the Central Committee resign and the party give up its
constitutional monopoly on power, as in Poland, Hungary, East
Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   The rallies reflected a growing popular demand for the kind of
reform taking place elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Bulgaria was one of Moscow's staunchest allies, but Zhivkov did
little to implement change after Mikhail S. Gorabchev began
promoting more liberal policies.
   Since Zhivkov's downfall, the official media have become more
open, people have been able to demonstrate without police
interference for the first time in more than 40 years, and
independent groups have been allowed to function.
   At Monday's evening vigil, a woman caught up in an emotional
debate said Bulgarians were willing to stand there around the clock
until the leadership acted on reform.
   She and others said they believed Mladenov's promises of change,
but wanted a democracy anchored in law. ``Democracy and socialism
are not compatible,'' she declared.
   An old man spoke of change in East Germany and Czechoslovakia,
then said: ``We are a bit late, but we will catch up because we are
persistent.''
   State radio quoted Mladenov, formerly foreign minister, as
telling the Central Committee he favored broad dialogue with all
``who support a state of law in the framework of socialism.''
   An overwhelming show of hands at Sunday's rally approved a
resolution sponsored by 19 unofficial groups demanding abolition of
the constitution's first paragraph, which enshrines the leading
party role in Bulgaria.
   Mladenov has described the power monopoly as open to question
and Andrei Lukanov, his No. 2 man, said last week the party could
not claim such an exclusive right.
   The party daily, Rabotnichesko Delo, already had reported calls
for an early congress, the only party forum that can elect a new
Central Committee. It said more than 4,000 letters and telephone
calls demanding reforms had been received since Zhivkov was
dismissed.
   An opinion poll ordered by the Central Committee and published
by the paper said only 23 percent of those responding expressed
great trust in the party and only 32 percent indicated trust in any
political organization.
   Rabotnichesko Delo said 1,513 people were questioned Nov. 28 in
127 work collectives.
   It concluded little trust existed because official
organizations, including the party, had ``discredited themselves in
the eyes of the people'' and independent groups had not been tested.
   The party paper said one-third of those polled said they wanted
a multiparty political system, 68.9 percent supported a system
based on law and 77.7 percent said economic reform was imperative.

   President Bush said Monday he has asked
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani to ensure that a Connecticut
woman arrested on suspicion of storing arms for rebel forces
receive a fair trial.
   In his first public remarks about the Nov. 26 arrest in San
Salvador of Jennifer Casolo, Bush said all indications are that
Casolo will be treated fairly.
   ``I think it's essential that she receive a fair trial,'' Bush
said at a White House news conference. ``So far I have not received
any indication that she will not receive a fair trial.''
   The Bush administration came under sharp criticism from
congressional Democrats after presidential spokesmen made comments
indicating that the Salvadoran government had a case against Casolo.
   Bush made no mention of the criticism. He said nothing
indicating that the government is seeking amnesty for Casolo or
considers her innocent.
   ``I have instructed our ambassador, (William Walker) and indeed
talked to Cristiani personally, to represent to the Salvadorans
that it's essential that a fair trial be granted,'' Bush said.
   ``I am satisfied so far that that will take place,'' he added.
``But it is essential that it not only take place but that it have
all the appearances of fairness, and I think that's what Mr.
Cristiani is determined to do.''
   Casolo, a 28-year-old resident of Thomaston, Conn., went to El
Salvador in 1985 to work for Christian Education Seminars, a group
dedicated to influencing U.S. policy by organizing tours for
Americans to learn about the 10-year-old civil war.
   She and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 after a
police raid on her white stucco house in San Salvador. From the
walled garden behind the house, police said they uncovered 103
mortar grenades, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet
of slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for
Soviet-made automatic rifles.
   Casolo was ordered held Friday for 90 days while an
investigation continues into possible links between her, the
explosives and Salvadoran rebel forces.
   Casolo's friends and family insist she is innocent, the victim
of a setup. The Rev. Jesse Jackson attended a service Sunday in
Hartford attended by Casolo's parents and friends during which
Jackson criticized Bush saying it was ``sad'' that the president
``will not argue Jennifer's case.''
   U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., among those to criticize
Bush for his handling of the Casolo case, arranged for former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark to represent Casolo in El Salvador.
Salvadoran law prevents Clark from actually defending Casolo in
court. A Salvadoran attorney will represent her at trial while
Clark serves as a legal advisor.

<TEXT>
   Preliminary results of weekend local elections in
Latvia show the grassroots People's Front gaining over half the
vote in most regions and winning landslides in the countryside, an
activist said Monday.
   The People's Front, which favors independence for the small
Baltic republic, is now expected to win about 60 percent overall
and 80 percent of the rural vote in the final count, said member
Christian Rozenvalds.
   In Estonia, where elections also were held Sunday for seats in
local councils, results were not expected for several days, but
polls have indicated environmentalists were likely to receive half
the vote there.
   The elections were the first in a series of local votes to be
held in the coming months in all 15 republics as part of the Soviet
transition to multicandidate races and greater democracy.
   They are considered critical for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms
because it is the vast numbers of local and regional bureaucrats
who are blamed for blocking implementation of his new programs.
   In the Latvian capital of Riga, Communist Party boss Arnolds
Klautsens received only 40 percent of the vote for a seat in the
local council, and Rozenvalds said he was unlikely to win a run-off
because a citywide scandal had arisen about ballots faked in his
favor.
   Officials have predicted widespread defeats for Communist
leaders in both republics.
   There were 33,500 candidates running for city council and other
regional ``soviets'' in the two republics.

   As a high-level U.S. advance team left to
prepare for a drug summit in violence-torn Colombia, President Bush
said Monday he wants to go, despite some aides' misgivings, to
avoid sending a signal that traveling there is unsafe.
   ``Right now I'm very hopeful that the meeting will take place in
Cartagena,'' Bush told a group of editorial writers at the White
House.
   The administration advance team that left Monday will be
pressing for a stronger commitment from the cocaine-producing
countries of Peru and Bolivia on eradicating their large coca
crops, officials said.
   Bush acknowledged the security concerns some officials have
raised about taking his entourage to Colombia, but added:
   ``I don't want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody
should go to Colombia if they can't be protected.''
   He said a final decision has not been made on going to
Cartagena, a major center of drug-trafficking operations for the
Andes.
   ``I will listen to the experts. I will not do anything
imprudent. Nobody has ever accused me of doing anything too daring.
   ``But I don't want to undermine this courageous leader,'' he
said of Colombian President Virgilio Barco. He said he did not want
to ``send some signal'' that Barco ``can't provide the security for
three heads of state visiting his country.''
   The administration advance team, headed by Assistant Secretary
of State Bernard Aronson, left for Cartagena on Monday to work on
an agenda and lay groundwork for the summit. The team will also
visit Peru and Bolivia to push for greater evidence of commitment
on the part of those two countries in the antidrug efforts, said
officials.
   The summit will include Peruvian President Alan Garcia and
Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora in addition to Bush and Barco.
   The advance group also will try to coordinate with the other
nations on strategy and will discuss future U.S. assistance. Among
the items that will be addressed are cooperation on money
laundering, sharing intelligence, extradition and crop substitution
for the coca fields.
   Bush's drug policy coordinator, William Bennett, said the
administration finds Colombia's antidrug actions and commitment
``exemplary.''
   But he told reporters last week that ``the jury is still out''
on Peru and Bolivia, both of which receive drug-fighting aid from
the United States.
   He did not elaborate, but one administration official, speaking
on the condition of anonymity, said, ``They could be more
aggressive.''
   Drug Enforcement Administration officials have said that the
eradication program in Peru and Bolivia is still developing and is
improving.
   Bush has repeatedly praised Barco's efforts in the face of
escalating bombings and violence laid to drug lords against
civilian and government targets.
   Colombia's problems revolve mostly around drug-processing
activities and smuggling, with the major cocaine cartels operating
from there.
   But Peru and Bolivia have the agricultural fields where large
quantities of coca leaves are cultivated for processing into
cocaine.
   ``There is definitely a lot of coca out there that has not been
eradicated,'' an administration official said Monday. ``Clearly,
people need to get energized and intensify their efforts.'' He also
requested anonymity.
   Officials have said that the extent of U.S. assistance to the
three Andean countries is tied to their performance on the drug
efforts.
   The administration wants to see more emphasis by those
governments on economic alternatives for the farmers whose
livlihoods would be stripped by eradication of their coca crops,
officials said.
   By law, the White House must certify each year that countries
are cooperating in the war on drugs before they can receive foreign
aid.
   Negligible progress in reducing coca production has been
achieved despite spending of more than $100 million on the problem
over the last 17 years, according to a State Department report to
Congress in July.
   The department says that coca production has increased every
year.
   Figures provided by Bennett's office say Peru produced 249
metric tons of coca in 1988 and Boliva 160 metric tons, while
Colombia's crop was put at 49 metric tons.
   Among those accompanying Aronson to Colombia this week are
Bennett's deputy, John Walters, and Michael Skol, the deputy
assistant security of state for South American affairs.

<HEAD>Most Plutonium Managers to be Removed in Nuclear Plant Shakeup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of five of the six plutonium
processing buildings at the idled Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
likely will be replaced next month as part of a broad plan for
improving safety, officials said Monday.
   Some details of the plan were spelled out for an Energy
Department advisory panel by David B. Van Leuven, who will be
associate general manager for defense programs at Rocky Flats when
EG&amp;G Inc. takes over as plant operator Jan. 1.
   The current operator, Rockwell International Corp., announced in
September it was quitting Rocky Flats because of a dispute with the
Energy Department over potential criminal liability for past
environmental violations.
   The plant, on the outskirts of Denver, is owned by the Energy
Department and is the nation's only maker of plutonium triggers for
nuclear weapons.
   A phased halt to Rocky Flats plutonium operations began in
mid-November to give EG&amp;G time to develop an improvement plan. The
plant has been criticized by government and independent inspectors
for a wide variety of shortcomings, including inadequate safeguards
against worker exposure to radiation.
   Van Leuven told the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility
Safety that he would inspect the management of all six plutonium
buildings in the next few weeks, and that he would bring five
executives from other EG&amp;G-operated facilities to be on ``ready
standby'' to replace up to five of the building managers.
   Van Leuven said he already had determined that five of the six
managers, who work for Rockwell International, are unlikely to meet
EG&amp;G's managerial standards.
   ``One has the capabilities I'm looking for, the rest are
questionable,'' he said.
   Van Leuven said Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordered EG&amp;G
to develop by the third week in January a timetable for restarting
Rocky Flats plutonium operations. He declined to speculate on how
long the plant would be idled, but said it would not be restarted
until all safety-related questions had been answered.
   ``We'll take however long it takes'' to ensure safe operation,
he told a reporter.
   Phil Warner, the designated EG&amp;G general manager at Rocky Flats,
told the panel an ``integrated plan'' for running Rocky Flats
probably would be ready by the end of March.
   Van Leuven said later that referred to a long-range plan for
improving the plant, and that a phased restart of plutonium
operations could begin before that plan is ready.

<TEXT>
   The brother-in-law of a former Mexican
president was charged Monday with conspiracy in the slaying of a
U.S. drug agent as part of a plot to keep a major international
drug trafficking cartel in business.
   Rubin Zuno Arce, 59, was to be arraigned later Monday on the new
charges linked to the 1985 torture-killing of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Zuno Arce, among 13 people charged in connection with Camarena's
death, was charged with conspiracy to commit violent crimes,
conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent and committing violent crimes
in aid of racketeering. If convicted, he faces a maximum of life in
prison.
   Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a co-defendant, is charged with the
felony murder of a federal agent, among other things.
   Zuno Arce, a businessman and brother-in-law of former Mexican
President Luis Echeverria, was arrested Saturday by the DEA as he
got off a plane arriving from Mexico at Los Angeles International
Airport.
   The agents arresting Zuno Arce were part of a task force that
was set up in 1985 exclusively to investigate the slayings in
Mexico of Camarena and his Mexican pilot.
   DEA agents believed Zuno Arce was visiting Los Angeles to help
his attorneys prepare a defense for his federal perjury trial
slated to begin this month, said Lochridge.
   Zuno Arce first was arrested Aug. 9 in San Antonio, Texas and
escorted to Los Angeles to testify before the grand jury probing
Camarena's slaying.
   Camarena, 37, was abducted in Guadalajara in February 1985. His
severely beaten body and that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar,
were found in a remote area 70 miles north of the city.
   Zuno Arce was charged with lying when he told the grand jury he
didn't know two alleged Mexican drug kingpins connected to the
killings.
   The businessman owned a house in Guadalajara that was sold to
reputed drug baron Rafael Caro Quintero shortly before the
slayings. The government alleges Camarena was tortured and killed
in the house.
   Zuno Arce was released on $200,000 bail on the perjury charge
despite a federal prosecutor's contention that he was a flight
risk. But he appeared in court in late October for a hearing.

<TEXT>
   Michigan colleges and universities should develop
a ``zero tolerance'' policy and require a course in ethnic
relations to improve campus race relations, the Michigan Civil
Rights Commission recommended Monday.
   The recommendations stemmed from the commission's discussions
with administrators, students and faculty from the University of
Michigan and Michigan State, Ferris State and Western Michigan
universities.
   ``It is our hope that universities will look at these
recommendations as a guide and use them to implement a program of
this sort on their campus,'' Commission Chairman Benny Napoleon
said at a commission meeting.
   Racial tensions rose on several campuses this year. Sit-ins were
held at Ferris State, Michigan State and Wayne State universities.
Students demanded racial sensitivity from staff and other students,
and policies against individuals who commit racist acts.
   The ``zero tolerance'' policy would define unlawful and
unacceptable acts of racism, and authorize punishments.
   The ethnic-relations class would be required for all freshman to
sensitize individuals to racial issues and concerns. At least seven
U.S. universities already require such a class.
   An official at one Michigan institution said he didn't believe a
course would solve the racial problems.
   ``I believe race relations should be spread around in all
courses, not stuffed into one,'' Western Michigan President Diether
H. Haenicke said.
   Napoleon said some Michigan schools already are implementing
programs.
   ``MSU is scheduled to begin its ethnic-relations class in
1992,'' he said. ``We would hope that they would begin earlier than
that.''
   University of Michigan President James Duderstadt told the
Economic Club of Grand Rapids on Monday that all universities have
a responsibility to strive for ethnic diversification because the
United States will become increasingly multicultural in the next
century.
   He said he believes his school has made ``remarkable progress''
in reducing racial tension through minority recruiting.
   The recommendations also included setting up procedures to
process discrimination complaints, developing and distributing a
booklet for students on their civil rights, and periodic reviews of
campus policies and their success.
   ``Through a concerted effort, we can develop programs that not
only reduce current tension, but also prevent future unlawful acts
of harassment from occurring,'' state Department of Civil Rights
Director John Roy Castillo said.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Suit to Bar Africa's Tallest Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's highest court Monday
dismissed an environmentalist's lawsuit that tried to prevent the
ruling party from building Africa's tallest building in a city park
that is popular with the poor.
   The High Court dismissed a suit filed Nov. 24 by
environmentalist Wangari Maathai that sought to prevent the Kenya
African National Union from building a 60-story tower in Nairobi's
downtown Uhuru Park.
   Justice Norbury Dugdale, in his ruling to a packed courtroom,
said only the attorney general can sue on behalf of the public.
   Mrs. Maathai, who before the ruling accused the court of being
more concerned with ``politics than law,'' said she was
disappointed with the decision but had written to acting Attorney
General Timothy Mibei asking him to take up the matter.
   ``The most important thing is to rise and express one's opinion
and say no when you should say no,'' she said. ``If we are not
listened to then at least we have done what we could do within our
own constraints.''
   Mibei was unavailable for comment Monday.
   The controversy involves the ruling party's plans to build a
media complex in 10-acre Uhuru Park that would include the 60-story
tower, two 10-story wings, malls, an auditorium, parking for 2,000
people, and conference facilities for 5,000 people.
   Scores of people have written letters to Kenya's two independent
newspapers criticizing the plan and pleading with the government to
move the complex elsewhere.
   But President Daniel arap Moi told critics two weeks ago to
``shut up'' and succeeded in silencing all but Mrs. Maathai. A
four-story statue of Moi is planned for the front of the tower.
   Mrs. Maathai has continued to pursue her efforts to get the
building relocated to one of the vast open areas around Nairobi
despite Parliament's threats to ban her environmental organization,
the Green Belt Movement.
   She says the $197 million project is not in the public interest.
   Lawmakers said her court effort to bar the complex was
tantamount to suing the head of state and accused her 12-year-old
environmental group of being subversive.

<TEXT>
   Five years after his acquittal on cocaine
trafficking charges, auto maker John Z. De Lorean remains embroiled
in litigation that has stalled his plans to launch a new, more
exotic car company.
   ``It's incredible. What happens in the legal system is they keep
you there until you run out of money and then they move on to
someone else,'' De Lorean said in a telephone interview Friday from
his New York apartment.
   But the 64-year-old onetime golden boy of Detroit's executive
suites isn't discouraged. He says he sees an end to all the
lawsuits and is delighted about a recent British High Court
decision throwing out a $60 million default judgment against him.
   ``All these things, if they don't kill you they make you
stronger,'' he said.
   De Lorean has counter-sued the British government for $200
million _ one of the lawsuits still pending. In another, De
Lorean's California lawyer, Howard Weitzman, has sued him over fees.
   De Lorean said he's spent $6 million to $7 million on legal fees
since 1982. But he's not hurting for money. With bankruptcy
proceedings resolved, he has regained access to a snow grooming
company in Utah that he said is being sold for $26 million.
   DeLorean also said he's back on good terms with his former wife,
model Cristina Ferrare, with whom he underwent a bitter divorce.
   ``We're really getting along very well,'' he said. ``It's great
for the children.''
   As for his present love life, he said, ``I've been going with a
nice girl. But I'm not sure I'm good at being married.''
   What's left is his first and forever love _ cars.
   ``I've got another car I'm working on,'' he said. ``I'm building
it in Germany. I have a number of patents.''
   The new company, he said, won't start up until all of his
lawsuits are settled, and it won't half as ambitious as DMC.
   ``It's going to be an exotic,'' he said of his new dream car,
``a V-12, very high performance car and it will be very expensive,
in the $175,000 range. The more expensive and more limited, the
less it costs to go in.''

<HEAD>Senate Panels to Hold Hearings on Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations and Armed
Services committees will hold a series of hearings early next year
to explore the changes occurring in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union and their implications for the United States.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Monday
that a central question is the extent to which the military threat
posed by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact has been reduced and
how U.S. military strategy and defense spending should be adjusted.
   Mitchell said administration officials, including Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, and outside experts will be called as
witnesses.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services Committee chairman,
said his panel also would focus on the implications for
conventional and strategic arms control and the military role of
U.S. allies.
   Mitchell said that while there is much speculation that a
reduced military threat from the Soviet Union will lead to reduced
defense spending, it is not clear whether that will result in a
``peace dividend'' that can be used to meet other domestic spending
priorities.

   An atheist forced village officials to
remove lighted crosses from two water towers, but residents are
fighting back with scores of home-made crosses in businesses, front
yards and windows.
   Christmas spirit and town unity have never been stronger,
residents of this community 30 miles northeast of Chicago said
Monday.
   ``We felt very badly that this man could come in here that
doesn't even live here, and say that we had to stop a tradition
we've been doing for years,'' said Katie Wolter. ``This is people's
way of speaking out.''
   Robert Sherman, a Midwest official of American Atheists Inc.,
contends the two disputed crosses _ which sat atop the village
water towers for almost 40 years and traditionally were lighted for
the Christmas season _ represented an unconstitutional mingling of
church and state.
   He threatened to sue the village if the crosses, removed last
winter for repairs, were used this Christmas season. The village
board decided Nov. 21 to replace them with lighted stars rather
than risk a costly legal battle.
   Sherman said the board's decision was a ``smashing victory'' for
American Atheists, which has challenged the use of crosses and
nativity scenes on public property across the country.
   ``This is the first time in the history of this country that
illuminated Christian crosses have been forced down from government
property without necessitating a lawsuit,'' said Sherman, of the
Chicago suburb of Buffalo Grove.
   But if there are no crosses on the water towers, they've sprung
up nearly everywhere else as the community of about 6,000 counters
the move.
   One of the first appeared on top of Mers Restaurant, a block
from the towers.
   ``When you see the crosses up, it's Christmas time,'' said
restaurant co-owner Bobby Mers, a lifelong village resident. ``I'm
still kind of upset that it's not on the tower. I grew up with it.''
   Hand-made crosses have appeared at Ms. Wolter's jewelry store
and other businesses and homes at the urging of Mayor James Keagle
and others.
   The Rev. Byron Maher has counted 95 crosses ``in just a fifth of
my parish'' since he exhorted his congregation at the
Transfiguration Roman Catholic Church to show their faith.
   ``Some are on the homes, some are in the yards, some are in the
windows, some people have used their TV antennas to make crosses _
they've put lights on them,'' Maher said.
   Kevin Kennebeck, vice president of Performance Paving, scaled a
110-foot telephone pole at his business to attach a 12-foot lighted
cross near the top that he hopes will mark a new tradition.
   The effect is not just visual, Maher said.
   ``Many people have come and told me that there's never been such
unity and Christmas spirit as there's been now,'' he said.
   Sherman said he thinks the response is more a show of resentment
toward atheists than a display of Christian faith or Christmas
spirit.
   Maher disputes that.
   ``It's not attacking him at all, it is showing our
Christianity,'' the priest said.
   ``In fact, we've got countless people here praying for him.''

<TEXT>
   The likes of Mary Poppins, Babar, the Mad
Hatter and the Tin Man enliven the White House this Christmas in a
decoration theme highlighting first lady Barbara Bush's commitment
to literacy.
   Mrs. Bush said Monday she hopes her holiday choice will
encourage families to read together.
   ``There is sort of a little message to our Christmas this year _
which is a family oriented, reading to their children message,''
she said as she showed off the majestic 18-foot Christmas tree in
the first floor Blue Room.
   The tree is decorated with 80 soft dolls each representing a
character from a storybook or literature. Among them: a
tafetta-bedecked Scarlett O'Hara with wide-brimmed southern lady's
hat; an ax-wieling Paul Bunyon astride his blue ox, Babe; a
satin-clad Aladdin with his genie bottle in hand; and a
school-marmish Jo from the classic ``Little Women.''
   Tiny books also adorn the tree, and beneath it have been placed
an array of books wrapped with bows.
   ``This is sort of a celebration of libraries and books,'' said
Mrs. Bush, who for many years has devoted herself to the cause of
literacy.
   The tree also has the traditional 100 four-inch velvet balls,
two representing each state in the nation.
   Mrs. Bush, fresh from her daily 1{-mile swim, gave reporters a
tour of the lavish White House decorations, which include 14 large,
snow-flocked Blue Spruce trees in the entrance and cross halls at
the main entrance.
   Planning for the decorations began last February when the first
lady discussed her wishes with the White house chief floral
designer, Nancy Clarke.
   In the East room stand two 14-foot Blue Spruce trees, ornately
garlanded with copper-red metallic ribbons and bursting with
life-size grapes, pears, apples, oranges, tangerines and
pomegranates.
   Also in the East room against a central mirror is displayed the
baroque 48-figure creche that has been in the White House every
Christmas since 1967 when it was donated by a New Jersey woman.
   Numerous poinsettias deck the halls and in the State Dining
Room, a giant gingerbread house is tempting the Bush grandchildren,
Mrs. Bush said. It was created by White House Executive Chef Hans
Raffert, who has baked a gingerbread house for the presidents
annually for the last 20 years.
   The table in the State Dining Room features two boxwood
topiaries decoated with densely packed candy canes, peppermint
balls and cookies.
   Mrs. Bush said there was a time when she did all the
Christmas-cookie baking for the family but now their cook makes and
decorates them.
   The Bushes will have their five children, spouses and 11
grandchildren on hand for the holiday. The entire clan will travel
to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., next week to spend
Christmas there.
   The family opens presents on Christmas day in what the first
lady predicted will be ``chaos.''
   She and the president will not exchange gifts, Mrs. Bush said.
   ``We do not give presents, the president and I,'' she said
adding that it is an arrangement they have followed for many years
because ``We felt we just had so much.''
   The Bushes were on hand this past weekend as 40 volunteers put
up the Christmas decorations. They had intended to spend the
weekend at Camp David, but were prevented by snowy weather. Mrs.
Bush said they enjoyed being there for the decorating.
   ``We bounced up and down the stairs, George and I, talking to
these people.''
   They came in Saturday night to find the decorators engaged in a
snow fight with the fake snow, she added.
   The Bushes have their own personal Christmas tree in their
private upstairs quarters and it is decorated with cookies, she
said.

   The Navy plans to drop a small-scale model of
a satellite launch vehicle into California's Monterey Bay on
Thursday in a hush-hush program to develop a reusable, low-cost
rocket, a space industry newspaper said Monday.
   The test will involve releasing the model booster from a
helicopter to demonstrate that the booster can survive a water
landing at 200 mph, said Space News, citing unnamed sources.
   The Navy was asked for comment but did not immediately respond.
   The only reusable space vehicles the United States has are the
shuttle and its rocket boosters. The shuttle lands on a runway; the
boosters drop into the ocean, are towed back to port to be
refurbished for reuse.
   ``The project is being conducted on a shoestring budget with
Navy funds authorized by Navy Admiral Carlisle Trost, chief of
naval operations, according to the Navy source,'' Space News said
in its Dec. 11 preview issue.
   The rocket would take off from the ocean surface, which would
provide tremendous flexibility in launching secret missions. The
spent stages would be slowed in their fall and buoyed at the
surface by balloons.

<HEAD>Howard `Pappy' Mason Guilty in Murder of Police Officer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a violent crack ring was found
guilty Monday of ordering the murder of a rookie police officer who
was guarding the firebombed home of a witness in a drug case.
   Howard ``Pappy'' Mason, 31, faces mandatory life in prison
without parole for a slaying that had come to symbolize the battle
against illegal drugs.
   Jurors in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn deliberated 13 hours
over three days before finding Mason guilty on all 11
drug-conspiracy charges, including one specifying that he ordered
the February 1988 murder of Officer Edward Byrne, 22.
   Byrne's parents, Matthew and Ann Byrne, who had attended the
trial daily, embraced and thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Leslie R.
Caldwell, before quickly leaving court by a rear door.
   The elder Byrne, a lawyer and former police lieutenant, gave his
slain son's badge to George Bush, who used it as a potent symbol
during his presidential campaign. Bush now keeps the shield in his
Oval Office desk.
   Mason boycotted most of his trial and remained in a courthouse
holding cell, presumably watching on closed-circuit television.
   Four other people were convicted in state court earlier this
year of carrying out the murder and have been sentenced to the
maximum of 25 years to life in prison.
   ``This accounts for all the people who had a hand in the brutal
murder,'' U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said of Mason's
conviction.
   State authorities let Mason be tried in federal court because
New York state rules of evidence restricting testimony by
codefendants made conviction in state court less likely.
   During the trial of the four convicted murderers, there was
frequent testimony that the order to assassinate Byrne had come
from Mason's cell at the Brooklyn House of Detention. He had been
convicted on a weapons charge and jailed two days before the
slaying.
   The prosecution's key witness, Viola Nichols, testified Mason
had directed the officer's murder because another patrolman
``disrespected'' him in front of his colleagues by upbraiding him
for drinking beer in public.
   Defense lawyer Harry C. Batchelder Jr. filed a motion to set the
verdict aside, asserting Mason was not mentally competent to
participate in his trial, which lasted about two weeks.

   President Bush on Friday cited ``enormous
frustrations'' in dealing with the Democratic-led Congress but said
he will hunt again next year for bipartisan support for his
sometimes-battered agenda.
   ``I'm disappointed in some ways with the Congress and with our
progress,'' Bush told a group of editorial-page editors. He cited
crime, clean-air legislation and child-care programs as examples.
   Democratic leaders in turn have said that those are all
important issues but that Bush's proposals would do too little to
solve problems or would take unwise approaches.
   Bush also suggested that the $50 billion approved by Congress to
rescue the ailing savings and loan industry ``might not be enough.''
   In a half-hour question-and-answer session, Bush cited
``negative, highly partisan comments'' from the Democrats in
Congress.
   Still, Bush, who began his term pronouncing an ``era of the
offered hand,'' said: ``I'm determined, when the Congress comes
back, to hold out the hand and try again.''
   On another partisan issue, the president dismissed as
``balderdash'' suggestions that Republicans are losing support
among voters because of the abortion issue.
   ``The American people have not changed their fundamental views
that had them support me over my opponent,'' Bush said. ``The
Democrats hold a seat, hold a gubernatorial seat, and they dance
around the grave of what they hope is the Republican party,'' he
added.
   He was referring to the Virginia governor's race in which
Democrat Douglas Wilder won last month after a campaign emphasizing
his views in favor of abortion rights.
   Overall, the president said he was generally satisfied with a
``productive year.'' He boasted that not one of his 10 vetoes had
been overridden.
   On other topics in the wide-ranging session, the president:
   _ Denied his decision to send National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and a top State Department aide on a surprise visit to
Beijing marked a move toward ``full normalization'' of relations.
He said the weekend mission, four months after last June's bloody
government crackdown, was an attempt not to further ``isolate the
Chinese people.''
   _ Insisted he would do nothing to force the issue of German
reunification. ``It's too sensitive and it's not the role for the
United States to do that,'' Bush said, suggesting the day when
either the U.S. president or the Soviet leader had a role on the
issue of European boundaries had long passed.
   _ Reiterated his desire that a drug summit can be held next
February in Colombia, despite recent violence there, saying he
wanted no part of sending a signal that Colombian President
Virgilio Barco ``cannot provide the proper security.''
   _ Said that he would give more attention next year to trade
issues, saying that, while he had no intention of ``bashing''
trading partners needlessly, ``I am not relaxed about where we
stand'' in terms of dismantling foreign barriers against U.S. goods.
   _ Said that the United States does not favor any step that would
force Israel to be ``pressured into negotiating'' with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, despite Secretary of State James
A. Baker III's efforts to help formulate a way to get Middle East
peace talks going.
   _ Said he was ``satisfied so far'' that Jennifer Casolo would
receive a fair trial in El Salvador. Casolo, 28, of Thomaston,
Conn., was arrested Nov. 26 in a police raid at her house in San
Salvador. Police say they found weapons including grenades, and
dynamite, hidden behind her house.
   On Friday, Casolo was ordered held for 90 days while
investigation continues. Bush said he had personally told
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani ``that it's essential that a
fair trial be granted.''
   Bush also denied allegations that U.S. officials had mistreated
a Salvadoran witness who had implicated the Salvadoran Army in the
slayings of six Jesuit priests last month.
   On his relations with Congress, Bush said, ``there have been
some good moments and there've been some enormous frustrations.''
   ``I am not overly satisfied, but I think the first year has gone
pretty well,'' he said.
   He said he was particularly pleased that the United States was
ending the year with a still-growing economy.
   And, while difficult budget choices loom, Bush said he was
pleased he had been ``able to keep my pledge of `no new taxes' for
this year.''
   At the same time, Bush said that efforts to clean up the
financially troubled savings and loan industry were proceeding
haltingly. Despite the $50 billion Congress authorized for Congress
to close down defunct S&amp;Ls, Bush said ``I'm now told this might not
be enough.''
   ``All I do know is that we've got to clean it up and it's a
whale of a mess,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   A woman who was the anonymous plaintiff in one of
two landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortion said
she hopes never to be separated from her 22-year-old daughter now
that the two are reunited.
   ``I told her she's just going to have to plan on being with me
the rest of her life,'' said Sandra Cano, who had a tearful reunion
with her daughter, April Takier of Tacoma, Wash., at the Atlanta
airport Saturday.
   The two were separated 20 years ago before Mrs. Cano, then
Sandra Bensing, became plaintiff ``Jane Doe'' in Doe vs. Bolton,
the lawsuit that successfully challenged Georgia's abortion law.
   The Supreme Court used her case to strike down the law on Jan.
22, 1973, the same day the court struck down Texas' abortion law in
the more famous case labeled Roe vs. Wade.
   Mrs. Cano later decided not to go through with the abortion, and
gave birth to Melissa. She gave her up for adoption in 1970.
   Mrs. Cano was reunited with Melissa, 19, earlier this year and
found her son Joel, now 23, in 1977.
   The reunion with April leaves only one of her four children
still missing: a daughter, whom she named Lisa before she gave her
up for adoption in 1969.
   ``As long as she's missing, there's still part of me missing,''
Mrs. Cano said of Lisa. ``But I have nowhere else to look.''
   Mrs. Cano said her two older children, Joel and April, had been
taken from her in 1969. She said she lost custody of the children
after a dispute with a sitter and ``because of me being young and
naive.''
   Mrs. Cano, who lives in suburban Atlanta but has declined to
give her hometown, said she tried to regain custody of the children
and finally got Joel when he was 11.
   She was unsuccessful in her attempts to find April until the
week after Thanksgiving. Ms. Takier called, saying she had been
trying to find her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive
family as a teen-ager.
   She said she remembered that her name originally was Bensing and
that she was adopted in Georgia, so ``my roommate and I sat down
and all we did was start calling all the cities all over Georgia
looking for a Bensing.''
   ``We couldn't find that, so we looked for Alva and Eva Smith, my
first foster family. I got their number and called her, and she had
my grandma's phone number and my grandma had my mom's phone
number.''
   She said she didn't recognize her mother at their reunion
Saturday, but ``my brother looks exactly like I remember him.''
   Ms. Takier said she plans to stay in Georgia indefinitely and
will seek work as a lab technician.
   ``I cried'' when she saw her mother, she said. ``I didn't know
what to say. I'm so happy, so excited.''
   Mrs. Cano has changed her position on abortion and has become a
spokeswoman for anti-abortion groups in the years since Doe vs.
Bolton.
   She said last week that she plans to increase her involvement in
the anti-abortion movement now that she has most of her family back.

   Congressional Democrats, denouncing renewed
high-level Bush administration contacts with China as
``embarrassing kowtowing,'' vowed Monday to revive legislation
protecting Chinese students here and imposing sanctions against
their government.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters
that Bush's decision to dispatch two leading foreign policy
advisers to Beijing over the weekend undermines his
administration's professed support for human rights and ``sends the
worst possible message at the worst possible time.''
   Mitchell said Bush's move makes ``a mockery of our profession of
concern for human rights'' and was ``inconsistent with our stated
ideals.''
   The majority leader noted that Bush had declared in June that
the United States could not conduct normal relations with a
government that had reacted to weeks of pro-democracy
demonstrations with a bloody crackdown.
   ``Yet that is exactly what appears to be happening,'' Mitchell
said, referring to the mission to Beijing led by National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger.
   Mitchell said Bush's decision raises the question of how the
administration might react if the Soviet Union intervened
militarily to crackdown on democratic movements in Eastern Europe
and within its own borders.
   ``Will the president send his emissaries to Moscow to tell tham
that we want to do business as usual?'' Mitchell asked
hypothetically. ``Or are there two standards, one for the Chinese
and another for the Russians and everyone else?''
   The majority leader also said he will lead efforts to override
Bush's Nov. 30 veto of legislation to permit any Chinese student
fearful of reprisal if forced to return home to remain in the
United States beyond his visa's expiration.
   Bush said then that he was directing Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh ``to take the steps necessary to extend administratively
to all Chinese students in the United States the same benefits''
that were in the bill he was vetoing.
   Separately, the House and Senate voted just before adjourning
for the year Nov. 21 to impose political and economic sanctions on
the Chinese government. But the approvals were to slightly
different versions of the legislation and the differences were not
resolved before adjournment.
   Both versions would have imposed as a matter of law sanctions
Bush put in place days after the June 3 crackdown. Both measures
would permit the sanctions to be lifted if the human rights
situation in China improved.
   The White House opposes that legislation, saying Bush needs
flexibility in lifting the sanctions, which include a suspension of
financing for U.S. investment in China and a ban on exports to
China of military, nuclear and satellite technology.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Asian subcommittee, said he believes Bush's veto of the
visa-extension bill will be overridden and that Congress will act
quickly to revive the sanctions legislation when it returns next
month.
   ``I believe the Congress is not in the mood to kowtow to these
Chinese leaders,'' Solarz said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, called Bush's move ``ill timed to say the least.''
   At a time of major breakthroughs for democracy in Eastern
Europe, Bush's action sends the message that ``we care less about
human rights in China,'' Nunn said.
   Asked about Bush's announcment that China now has promised not
to sell missiles in the Middle East, Nunn noted that an identical
promise was made several years ago to then-Secretary of Defense
Frank Carlucci.
   ``If the Chinese have now promised that a second time, the
obvious question is, what happened the first time?'' Nunn said.
   Bush himself received a similar assurance when he visited China
in February.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three organizations intent on helping Poland
enhance its 1990 harvest Monday urged U.S. agriculture businesses
to donate desperately needed machinery, chemicals, feed and animal
pharmaceuticals.
   The donations are necessary because of a ``gap in the U.S.
legislative package'' that provided $533 million in assistance to
Poland and Hungary, said Josiah Lee Auspitz, secretary of the Sabre
Foundation, a non-profit educational and scientific organization
that promotes free enterprise.
   The government is sending commodities and expertise to Poland,
but there was no provision in the law for the ``inputs'' _ such as
machinery, fertilizer and feed _ needed to make a modern farm
system work, Auspitz said.
   Polish banks, he said, don't have the money to loan against next
year's harvest to enable the farmers to buy those input items.
   Fertilizers, animal-care products, animal feed, pesticides,
fungicides and herbicides top the list of items Polish farmers
need. Also needed is machinery such as, planters, grain drills,
potato seeders, fertilizer spreaders, manure spreaders, plows,
sprayers, chain saws and harvesters.
   ``It is feasible financially for companies to donate (these
items) without losing a lot of money,'' Auspitz said at a day-long
seminar sponsored by his foundation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and the Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture, a
private Polish group dedicated to strengthening that nation's
private sector farms.
   The U.S. tax code allows for a deduction of twice the cost for
donations of inventory property for the care of the ill, the needy
or minor children. Private Polish farmers qualify as needy, said
tax lawyer Stuart A. Smith, who appeared on a panel with Auspitz.
   He said companies should make donations to a tax-exempt
organization, such as Sabre, which will certify the products are
going as gifts for the needy. The donated materials may not be
given to Polish government-owned farms or the government itself to
qualify for the U.S. tax deduction.
   About 77 percent of the farms in Poland are private, but under
communism, the state cooperatives were the only ones benefitting
from technological advances, David Hopper, senior vice president of
the World Bank, said during a separate panel discussion.
   ``The private sector has been starved from modern inputs,'' he
said.
   Polish farmers need the machinery and chemicals by April 1, the
beginning of the growing season, to show progress in the 1990
harvest.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher encouraged participation,
saying in a letter that Sabre's plan follows the intent of the
agreement on private-sector cooperation between Poland and the
United States.

   The National Opposition Union on
Monday accused the governing Sandinistas of waging a campaign of
provocation and violence to intimidate opponents in the Feb. 25
elections.
   Virgilio Godoy, the opposition union's vice presidential
candidate, and other party leaders told a news conference that
Sandinistas provoked rioting Sunday in Masatepe in which one man
was killed and more than 20 people were injured.
   He said the National Opposition Union (UNO) has sent a report on
the violence to a summit of five Central American presidents
meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   Godoy acknowledged that UNO supporters also took part in the
fighting, but insisted the Sandinistas started it.
   ``Violence generates violence; this is inevitable,'' he said.
``Nobody here is going to wait to have their throat slit. But the
provocations continue, and the one responsible for this is the
Sandinista Front.'' he said. He added that UNO will not pull out of
the campaign.
   Other party officials told the news conference that after the
rioting in Masatepe, 30 miles south of Managua, groups of masked
men attacked UNO supporters in many nearby villages. They said they
were asking for protection from United Nations and Organization of
American States election observers.
   Godoy said the Sandinistas' plan to hold a rally in Masatepe
``makes us think that the government has decided to escalate the
violence to try to impede normal development'' of the election
campaign.
   Witnesses in Masatepe Sunday said clashes broke out during a UNO
rally at the town park and combatants fought with machetes, rocks
and sticks. The Sandanistas' Masatepe campaign headquarters was
attacked and a car and motocycle were set afire.
   Ricardo Lopez Cerda, a member of the Sandinista campaign
committee, said he and 12 other people had taken refuge in the
party headquarters when he saw about 200 people approach, vowing to
shoot everyone inside.
   He said he and the others escaped through the back of the
building. The building was heavily damaged and the furniture
burned. A home next door also was sacked.
   Mario Casco, a UNO leader in Masatepe, said groups of hooded men
fired at a house in nearby San Bernardo with rifles and doused
another home with gasoline and threatened to burn it unless the
occupants came out.
   When two men came out of the house one was beaten with clubs and
the other was doused with fuel and threatened with incineration,
Casco said. Similar incidents occurred in other villages, he said.
``It was a night of terror.''
   Manuel Guevara Calero, 38, of La Concepcion village, was stabbed
to death. Reports in pro-government newspapers quoted his mother,
Hilda Calero, as blaming UNO militants.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington
the Sandinista government ``is at a crossroads.
   ``It can hold free and fair elections without violence and
intimidation, and begin the process of bringing peace to Nicaragua.
Or it can continue to turn the thugs loose on peaceful opposition
rallies, thereby ensuring the election results will be deemed
illegitimate and that the crisis in Central America will continue.''
   Sandinista and UNO groups have battled several times since
campaigning began in early November but the Masatepe rioting was
the worst. On Dec. 3, rival groups engaged in a stone-throwing
melee in Confradias, 12 miles east of Managua, and dozens were
injured.
   The presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala
and Honduras are trying to arrange truces in the civil war in El
Salvador and the fighting between Nicaraguan rebels and the
Sandinistas.
   Under an earlier agreement, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
advanced the general election to this February from November 1990
and promised they would be free and fair. In exchange the Central
American leaders declared they would try to demobilize the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, most of whom are based in
Honduran border camps, by Dec. 5.
   The Contras, with U.S. backing, defied the deadline, saying they
should remain as a fighting force to make certain the elections are
fair.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Announce Thai Drug Indictment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury indicted a reputed
high-ranking officer in an Asian drug organization Monday for
allegedly conspiring to export $1 billion worth of heroin from
Thailand to the United States.
   U.S. Attorney James West said the alleged operation was sort of
a ``Golden Triangle Factory Outlet'' for heroin. The Golden
Triangle is a remote drug-producing region of Southeast Asia.
   The case relied in part on the U.S. Justice Department's first
approval of roving wiretaps, in which 30 pay telephones were tapped
in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains resort region, West said.
   West said suspects in the drug ring used pay telephones to elude
detection. When surveillance showed the suspects were making a call
from one of the 30 phones, the wiretap was activated and calls to
seven or eight foreign countries monitored, he said.
   He said the alleged deal to bring as much as 2,000 kilograms _
4,400 pounds _ of heroin into this country a year through Mexico
represents the largest heroin trafficking scheme known to the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency.
   Named in the indictment was Na Ts'ai K'uei, pronounced
Na-Say-Cue, a native of Yunan, China, who had been living in Chiang
Ra province in Thailand. Na, already serving a jail term in
Thailand, is considered one of the most skilled heroin chemists and
refinery operators in the Golden Triangle, West said.
   ``What impresses me after 19 years in law enforcement is that
this indictment comes in at the highest levels,'' West said.
   West said the charges stem from a two-year-old investigation of
a heroin-trafficking organization based in the Poconos. The leader
of that organization, Raphael Santana, pleaded guilty in October to
conspiring to import heroin from Thailand and is awaiting
sentencing.
   The investigation is continuing, West said.
   The prosecutor claimed Na is one of the highest-ranking officers
in the Shan United Army, a rebel force of more than 4,000 heavily
armed soldiers that operates primarily in Burma.
   West said the Shan leader, known as Khun Sa, is considered the
world's largest supplier of heroin. Khun Sa and the SUA have
controlled opium and heroin production in the Gold Triangle along
the Thai-Burma border since the 1960s, West said.
   West said Khun Sa's organization is responsible for all phases
of heroin production, including opium poppy crops and laboratories
to refine heroin and morphine.
   Under terms of the deal, West said, an initial shipment of 100
kilograms of heroin, several thousand kilograms of marijuana and
various weapons, including M-16 assault rifles and rocket and
grenade launchers, were shipped to Mexico.
   According to the indictment, the drugs were to be smuggled into
the United States and the weapons funneled to Colombian drug lords.
Thai police, alerted by U.S. investigators, intercepted some of the
drugs, but not the weapons, West said.
   West alleged the deal was arranged by Albert Castagnola Jr. of
Summit Hill, Pa., who went to Bangkok to arrange for annual
shipments of 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms of heroin. Castagnola also
has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.
   Na began serving a six-year jail term in Thailand in May for
possession of 500 grams of opium, West said. Although the U.S. and
Thailand do not have an extradition treaty, West said every effort
would be made to bring Na to this country.

<HEAD>Police Talk to Black Leaders Following Shooting of Unarmed Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officials met with black
leaders Monday to discuss the apparent accidental shooting of an
unarmed black man by a white policeman during a drug search.
   ``We want to get as much information out as possible,'' said
Police Chief Joe Gerwens.
   Patrick Lavon Lee, 28, was shot in the back of the head in a
predominantly black neighborhood Sunday by Officer Robert Thomas
McCabe, 28.
   Lee was in critical condition Monday at Broward General Medical
Center, and was not expected to recover, doctors said.
   Gerwens said the timing was ``unfortunate'' because of events in
Miami.
   The shooting was the second involving a police officer and an
unarmed suspect in south Florida since a Miami jury on Thursday
convicted Officer William Lozano of manslaughter in the deaths of
two black men killed last January.
   The slayings triggered three days of rioting, and Miami had
braced for more unrest in the event Lozano was acquitted.
   Later Thursday, a Hallandale police officer shot and killed an
unarmed robbery suspect following a car chase. Both the suspect and
the officer were black.
   On Sunday, McCabe's .45-caliber automatic apprently went off
accidentally as Lee was pinned against a car, police said.
Officials said they were unsure why the officer drew his gun
because the suspect wasn't armed.
   Gerwens contacted black leaders Sunday, held a news conference,
and met with them again Monday to release more information. Black
leaders told reporters they were satisfied with the way things were
being handled.
   ``The only thing we can do now is wait for the investigation,''
said Carlton Moore, former president of the Fort Lauderdale chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
``We need to know exactly what happened and how the firearm
discharged.''
   The Broward County state attorney's office is investigating the
incident. Prosecutors said a grand jury would decide whether to
charge McCabe. The police department is also investigating.
   McCabe and his partner were looking for drug dealers in one of
the city's most violent neighborhoods in northern Fort Lauderdale
when they encountered Lee and another man.
   Witnesses said McCabe cursed Lee, then grabbed him and threw him
against a car. McCabe then put his gun at the back of Lee's head.
   ``Pat's hands were up and he started to turn around and then the
gun went off,'' said Carolyn Howard, who was standing less than 10
feet away.
   ``Then the cop said, `Oh my God, my gun went off,''' Howard said.
   No statement has been taken from McCabe, who has been with the
department since August.
   McCabe is on administrative leave with pay ``to collect
himself,'' said police spokesman Ott Cefkin.
   Lee has been arrested several times and been convicted of armed
robbery and cocaine possession with intent to deliver, police said.
He did not have any cocaine on him at the time of the shooting,
they said.

   This small, staunchly Marxist Arab
state has been swept up in the political reforms surging through
the Soviet bloc, with Aden radio saying Monday that the ruling
Marxists have opened the door for a multiparty system.
   It said the decision was adopted by the Central Committee of the
Yemen Socialist Party, the country's only legal party, at a two-day
meeting that concluded Monday afternoon.
   South Yemen, on the Red Sea, has developed strong political and
military links with the Soviet Union.
   The broadcast said the ground rules for the formation of new
parties would be published by the Political Bureau.
   The move was in line with a general political and economic
liberalization program that South Yemen has been introducing.
   Last month, independents were allowed to run in municipal
elections against party candidates.

<TEXT>
   The four Allies of World War II held their
first meeting in 18 years Monday and stressed the need for
stability at a time of convulsive change in East Germany, where the
Communist Party has lost its grip.
   The Soviet Union, which requested the meeting, urged respect for
existing boundaries and politics, the official East German news
agency ADN reported.
   Moscow has expressed concern at the speed with which the two
Germanys appear to be moving toward reunification, as have the
British.
   ADN said the Soviet news agency Tass quoted Ambassador
Vyacheslav Kochemasov as saying, ``The Soviet Union, during the
Four Power talks on Monday in West Berlin, strongly emphasized that
respect for the territorial and political reality of Europe is
necessary.''
   At a Central Committee meeting Saturday in Moscow, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev cautioned outsiders against interfering in
East Germany.
   A joint statement issued by the ambassadors Monday said: ``There
was a common understanding of the importance of stability, and
confidence was expressed that the United States, United Kingdom,
France and Soviet Union could contribute to that on the basis of
the quadripartite agreement of 1971.''
   It was the first meeting since the 1971 session that produced
agreement on improving the links between West Germany and Berlin,
which was isolated within East Germany.
   After World War II, the four victorious Allies divided Berlin
into four sectors. They still have the final say in its affairs.
   A Soviet diplomat in East Berlin said privately after Monday's
2{-hour conference: ``In principle, for all the four powers, it was
a very important meeting. We (the Soviets) underlined the need for
stability.''
   Those attending were by Vernon Walters, Christopher Mallaby and
Serge Boidevaix, the U.S., British and French ambassadors to West
Germany, and Vyacheslav Kochemasov, the Soviet ambassador to East
Germany.
   They made no comment, but posed for cameras under the flags of
their countries, which hanged side by side from a balcony of the
ornate former courthouse that serves at the Allied Control
Authority.
   In their statement, the ambassadors said the Soviet Union had
``expressed favorable interest'' in an initiative on Berlin former
President Reagan outlined in 1987.
   Reagan invited President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet
Union to ``work to bring the Eastern and West parts of the city
closer together.''
   His proposal also called for improved air service to Berlin,
making the city the site of youth exchanges and international
conferences, and holding a future Olympics there.
   Further meetings of the four powers may be held, the statement
said. A French diplomat would not give a timetable, but said the
level of future sessions would depend on the issues to be addressed.
   East Germany opened the Berlin Wall and its other borders a
month ago to halt a flood of emigration and huge pro-democracy
protests at home. Since then, public demand for reform has become
so great the entire Communist Party leadership resigned.
   Such West German politicians as Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Willy
Brandt, former chancellor and West Berlin mayor, have made a point
of visiting the city.
   Kohl says Germany will be reunited one day, but not now.
   He was attending a meeting of his Christian Democratic Party in
West Berlin on Monday, and told reporters: ``We do not know when
the day will come when this vision will become reality, but I am
convinced that it will come.''
   Of the concern in some countries about reunification, he said:
``The goal of our policies is not to create an overpowering Germany
in the middle of Europe. He said solution of ``the German question
within a European framework'' would respect the security needs of
all others involved.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is to meet with Kohl on
Tuesday. The talks had been planned for Bonn, the West German
capital, but U.S. officials said they would be held in West Berlin.
   On Sunday, before leaving Washington for Europe, Baker said
that, if reunification ``happens too abruptly, you run a greater
risk that it might not happen peacefully.''
   President Bush said Monday it was too sensitive an issue among
the European allies for the process to be speeded up, and added:
``This is a matter for the German people to decide; it isn't a
matter that's going to be determined by the United States.''
   Dorothee Wilms, West Germany's minister in charge of relations
with East Germany, said ``Germans have the right of
self-determination just like any other people.''
   In an interview with Saarland state radio, she said German unity
``was part of the way to European unity.''

   President Bush on Monday defended his decision
to renew contacts with China, saying relations with Beijing are
still strained by the Tiananmen Square crackdown but ``I don't want
to make it any worse.''
   He pledged to ``keep looking for ways to find common ground''
despite the Chinese army's killing of hundreds of pro-democracy
demonstrators last June.
   ``I don't want to see that China remains totally isolated,'' the
president said. However, he said his initiative toward China was
``not a signal of total normalization'' of relations.
   Acknowledging that China remains unapologetic for the crackdown,
Bush said, ``We have contacts with countries that have egregious
records on human rights.''
   Even as Bush spoke, congressional Democrats stepped up their
criticism of his actions. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
condemned the U.S. overture as ``embarrassing kowtowing to the
Chinese government.''
   Bush made his comments in a question and answer session with
editorial page editors from around the country after the return to
Washington of Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security
adviser, and Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, from
their surprise trip to Beijing.
   The president hailed an announcement from Beijing that it would
not sell missiles in the Middle East. Bush called that ``a very
sound development,'' though he had received the same assurances
during a trip to China last February.
   Explaining his decision to send Scowcroft and Eagleburger to
Beijing, Bush said, ``I do not want to isolate the Chinese people.
I do not want to hurt the Chinese people.''
   Bush said, ``Generally speaking, I realize the difficulty of
this relationship. I don't want to make it any worse _ like to
think it would improve.''
   Even so, he said that U.S. sanctions imposed against China on
June 5 remain in place and that the administration was still
unhappy with Beijing's human rights record.
   A White House statement acknowledged that Bush had decided in
September to allow Chinese engineers to resume work with a U.S.
team installing high-tech equipment on F-8 jet fighters to be sold
to Beijing. ``This was the only way to avoid turning a suspension
(of military sales) into a termination,'' the statement said,
adding that no deliveries have taken place.
   Bush talked in guarded terms, refusing to say precisely what
steps China would have to take to normalize relations with
Washington.
   Referring to the crackdown, Bush said, ``I think the Chinese
know they still have to address themselves to the problems that
were inherent in this episode.''
   Bush responded with an emphatic ``No'' when asked if he worried
that the Scowcroft-Eagleburger trip would signal the Soviets that
he would tolerate a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``I have no concern about that at all as long as we are properly
positioned in favor of human rights ... and as long as the Soviet
Union knew that we are not sending a signal of, quote, total
normalization, unquote. I will be careful that we do not send that
signal,'' he said.
   Bush's remarks were part of a wider attempt by the White House
to explain the gesture toward Beijing to and to soften criticism.
   The administration said that China, a world power with a nuclear
arsenal, was too important a country to remain in isolation,
despite U.S. outrage at its killing of demonstrators last June.
   Echoing Bush's theme, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``This trip was not intended to develop normal
relations with China in any immediate sense.''
   Democrats, meanwhile, continued to criticize Bush's decision.
   ``At a time when America's bipartisan commitment to freedom is
bearing fruit in Eastern Europe, the last thing he should be doing
is wavering in our commitment to freedom in China,'' said House
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``Standing up for our principles is always the best policy,''
Gephardt said. ``If America doesn't stand up for those who seek
freedom, who will?''
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``The administration supports human
rights in its words. It does not do so in its deeds. ... These
actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for human
rights and our inconsistent with our stated ideals.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said Bush's decision to send
emissaries to Beijing ``had nothing to do with concessions made or
internal changes'' in China.
   Bush's spokesman it was the democratic changes sweeping Eastern
Europe that prompted Bush to send Scowcroft and Eagleburger on
their mission.
   He said Bush felt ``these are changes in the world that have to
be considered by all the leaders certainly of the West as well as
the East, that it's important to know how China responds, how they
think about this, how they see their changing relationship to the
Soviet Union and Eastern bloc.''
   Fitzwater indicated the United States was unhappy the
Scowcroft-Eagleburger visit had been portrayed in the Chinese press
as evidence of U.S.-Chinese reconciliation. ``I probably would have
dictated a little different coverage,'' he said.

   An outspoken member of the Ku Klux Klan
who recruits for the racist organization has been fired from his
job as a police officer.
   Thomas Herman ``was terminated because the Board of Selectmen no
longer had the confidence in his ability and integrity to perform
his duties as a police officer,'' Chairwoman Betsy Coes said Monday.
   ``Most of the members of the department felt he had compromised
himself,'' said Police Chief Mike Daley.
   Coes said the board's decision was based partly on comments
Herman made that some selectmen considered threatening.
   ``It would be terrible for me to go out and slash their
(selectmen's) tires,'' Herman, who lives in Exeter, told the
Tri-Town Transcript. But, he added, ``anything that happens to them
after a certain point is justifiable.''
   The board fired Herman Friday. Herman did not attend, but five
of his supporters did, Coes said.
   Herman could not be reached for comment Monday. A message on his
answering machine encouraged callers to buy KKK merchandise for
Christmas.
   Herman still works as a radio technician for the Rockingham
County Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Wayne Vetter has said that
while the department does not agree with Herman, he won't fire him
because Herman has done nothing wrong.
   Last month, Exeter officials rejected Herman's request to sell
guns from his home. An appeal is pending.

   Nearly 4,000 mourners, led by Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, attended a joint funeral Mass on Monday for nine of
the 14 women that a church leader said were brutally slain ``in the
beauty of their youth'' by a mass murderer.
   Thousands of others stood in below-freezing temperatures,
quietly listening outside to the 80-minute service on loudspeakers.
   Monsignor Paul Gregoire, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
Montreal, presided at the services at Notre Dame cathedral for the
victims of the worst mass slaying in modern Canadian history.
   He noted that the women, almost all students at the University
of Montreal engineering school, were killed ``at a time when
everything seemed to assure them of a brilliant future.''
   Gregoire urged that in the memory of those who were ``brutally
mowed down in the beauty of their youth,'' we should ``seek to
build a world of solidarity, a world of friendship.''
   Many schools and universities throughout Quebec province
observed a minute of silence as the Mass started in the Place
d'Armes at 10:30 a.m. EST.
   A man identified as Marc Lepine, 25, of Montreal, killed the
women in a murderous rage last Wednesday and also wounded nine
women and five men before committing suicide with his semiautomatic
rifle. He shouted diatribes against feminists while roaming through
three of the school's six floors.
   The 14 women were aged 21 to 31. One was a school employee. The
others were students.
   ``We have the tools in our hand to build a better world, a world
of peace,'' Alain Perreault, president of the students' association
at the engineering school, said in a brief eulogy.
   He spoke of the victims' dreams and hopes and pleaded, ``Let's
achieve these great things ... of hope, of understanding.''
   Roland Dore, the school's president and principal, said it was a
legacy for survivors ``to build a world of tomorrow, a world where
every one of us, men and women, contribute equally.''
   He called for building ``a city of joy, a city of love.''
   Families of victims, dignitaries and students filled the
cathedral in Montreal's historic center.
   The nine gilt-edged white coffins, each with a floral bouquet,
were placed single-file in the cathedral's central corridor.
Processions later divided for separate, private burials.
   Families of five victims had chosen private funeral services.
   Professional associations asked engineers across Canada to wear
white armbands Monday as a memorial.
   On Sunday, at least 7,000 people paid respects to eight of the
victims whose coffins lay in state at the university's columned
hall of honor.
   The gunman burst into the school on the last day of classes
before examinations.
   Witnesses said he shouted ``I want the women!'' and ``You're all
a bunch of feminists! I hate feminists!'' He separated men from
women before opening fire in one classroom where six women died.
   He left a suicide letter that blamed women for much of his
unhappiness.
   Police said Lepine had studied with apparent hopes of entering
the engineering school, but no indication exists he ever actually
applied.

   Arctic weather descended into the East and Midwest on Monday,
carrying wind chills of 50 below zero to North Dakota and bringing
snow from New York to Michigan and into Tennessee and Kentucky.
   Farther west, snow spread over the southern Rockies and southern
high Plains. And much farther west, high winds whipped up blizzard
conditions on the snow-capped peaks of Hawaii.
   Snow advisories issued Monday in parts of Tennessee and
Kentucky, and winter storm watches were posted for Tuesday in
portions of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South
Carolina, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C., New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York's Long Island.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms developing ahead of the cold
front extended from southwestern Mississippi across south central
Louisiana to the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
   The arctic front blanketed eastern Iowa and northern Illinois
with snow overnight. Peoria, Ill., received 5.5 inches. The Chicago
area had an inch or less of snow, and officials there reported only
minor weather-related traffic problems.
   There were clouds over much of the south central and eastern
portions of the country, and sunny skies in the northern and
central Plains and the middle and upper Mississippi Valley.
   Strong northerly winds ushered the cold air into the central
U.S., bringing the 50-below-zero wind chills to North Dakota early
Monday. The strong winds also produced snow squalls in the upper
Great Lakes region.
   An upper level weather disturbance brought snow to the southern
Rockies and southern high Plains. Light snow fell on much of
eastern New Mexico and western Texas. Las Vegas, N.M., had two
inches of fresh snow on the ground by late morning.
   There also was snow falling in parts of Tennessee, and in a band
extending from New York and Pennsylvania to Ohio and southern
Michigan.
   Early Monday afternoon temperatures were in the teens and single
numbers from the northern and central Plains to the upper Great
Lakes, with subzero readings across North Dakota, northern South
Dakota and northern Minnesota. In Watertown, S.D., the wind chill
was the equivalent of 37 below zero.
   The arctic front produced a sharp contrast in temperatures
across south-central Texas, from 75 degrees at Brownsville to 48
degrees at Corpus Christi. Readings were only in the teens across
the Texas Panhandle.
   Temperatures were above 50 degrees across the Southeast, and in
the 60s and lower 70s along the central Gulf Coast and the Florida
peninsula.
   High winds buffeted California, and high wind warnings were
posted for portions of the San Francisco Bay area, the southern San
Joaquin Valley, the Tehachapi Mountains, and coastal and valley
areas of Southern California.
   Gusts up to 100 mph were recorded in the Grapevine area of the
Tehachapis.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow was posted for the eastern
slopes of the Montana Rockies, where southwest winds of 25 to 50
mph were sharply reducing visibilities in local ground blizzards,
and were producing wind chill readings as low as 40 degrees below
zero.
   High winds continued to buffet the snow-capped mountain peaks of
Hawaii Island, but an official said weather was not a factor in an
islandwide power failure.
   A high wind warning remained in effect for summits and upper
slopes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, both covered with heavy blankets
of snow. The wind brought blizzard conditions above 10,000 feet.
   Clouds and fog were prevalent in the Northwest, and dense fog
was prevalent in the valleys of central California.
   The low for the nation Monday morning was 30 degrees below zero
at West Yellowstone, Mont.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz said Monday he is ``still bullish'' about the Philippines
despite the latest coup attempt and thinks President Corazon
Aquino's government will survive.
   Shultz said he is visiting Manila as a private citizen and that
his trip was planned by his company five months ago. He now is a
director of the Chicago-based Bechtel construction and engineering
conglomerate.
   A seven-day military rebellion ended on Saturday when the last
rebel holdouts surrendered at Mactan air base, 350 miles south of
Manila. The uprising killed at least 113 people and injured more
than 580.
   ``I have a feeling that this effort by a renegade group in the
military to overturn a democratic government has had a kind of
reverse effect,'' Shultz said.
   He said the coup attempt ``galvanized the people, leading people
to say that we struggled hard to get a free and democratic system .
.. and it is precious and so we have to fight for it and support
it.''
   He said this will mean a strong following for the present
leadership, ``and so I continue to be bullish on the Philippines.''
   Shultz said he and his wife have become close to Mrs. Aquino and
were invited by her to dinner Sunday.
   ``She was in a very upbeat and feisty mood and I think it was
great,'' he reported.
   He said U.S. air cover that was provided for loyal forces early
in the insurrection was ``helpful'' in fighting the rebellion.
   ``It would have been shameful'' for the U.S. government to
refuse support to ``a friend ... a democracy under siege.''
   ``I believe that President Bush handled it extremely well. It's
the sort of thing that friends expect to see,'' Shultz added.
   He also said the pro-democracy movement sweeping East Europe is
``a phenomenon (that) is being replayed and the Philippines started
it.''
   He was referring to the ``people power'' revolt that drove the
late President Ferdinand Marcos into Hawaiian exile and installed
Mrs. Aquino as president in February 1986.
   Shultz on Monday called on Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who
said Shultz carried no message from Bush.

<HEAD>Pensions Increased for Widows of Servicemen Killed Before 1973</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 53,000 widows of British servicemen killed
in action before 1973 will receive an increase of $62 in their
weekly pension, the government announced Monday.
   Legislators of all political parties had called for a correction
in the disparity between the amounts given to widows of servicemen
killed before and after 1973.
   Widows of more than 2,000 servicemen killed in combat since 1973
get a minimum weekly pension of $196. The maximum weekly amount
given to widows of servicemen killed before 1973 was $90.
   Defense Secretary Tom King told Parliament the pension increases
will be tax free and payments will begin in April.
   He said the Conservative Party government ``recognizes the very
special place that these widows hold in the affections of this
country, and the particular debt that we all owe them.''
   Dame Vera Lynn, the singing sweetheart of World War II soldiers,
had campaigned for the pension improvements and said she was
disappointed the payments wouldn't start until April.
   ``It's a shame it's not more and it's sad they couldn't have had
it for Christmas,'' she said. ``It would have been a lovely present
for them.''
   Roland Boyes, the opposition Labor Party spokesman, called the
government's decision ``a major, though acceptable U-turn.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joyous cacophony of bells and
whistles heralded a popular victory over the Communists, and
Czechoslovaks settled down Monday to choosing a president from
among heroes the old order called villains.
   A presidential contest appeared to be developing, and the people
may get to decide.
   ``This is the end of communism!'' exulted Jana Navara, an
actress in pink mukluks, adding the sound of a brass chime to the
bells of Prague's Tyn Church on Old Town Square. Her 3-year-old
daughter made a triumphant ``V'' with two tiny fingers.
   The brief blast of noise replaced a threatened general strike,
canceled after events brought to power the first government in 41
years not dominated by Communists and drove President Gustav Husak
from office.
   Soldiers began removing barbed wire from the border with neutral
Austria and Prague radio reported plans to disband Pacem im Terris,
a state-controlled organization of Roman Catholic clergy. Priests
outside the group often were persecuted as the state tried to
impose its will.
   In the first official act against members of the old leadership,
the prosecutor charged former party ideologue Vasil Bilak for his
part in crushing the 1968 Prague spring of reform, the official
news agency CTK reported.
   ``According to some opinions, his deeds can be considered
treason,'' it said, but added that Bilak, now 72, could not be
tried because the statute of limitations had run out.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:
   _ Petar Mladenov, head of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said
free elections should be held in May and a new constitution written
that does not guarantee the party a monopoly on power.
   _ The four Allies of World War II held their first meeting in 18
years Monday and stressed the need for stability at a time of rapid
change in East Germany. It was requested by the Soviet Union, which
is concerned about German reunification.
   _ More than 150,000 people held a pro-democracy rally in
Leipzig, a southern industrial city in East Germany, and many
called for German unity.
   In Prague, Parliament meets Tuesday and has two weeks to elect a
president, but the Club of Communist Deputies, similar to a
majority party caucus, said Monday it would support a referendum.
   A statement from the club said it would ``recommend to the
Federal Assembly to adopt the necessary measures for an
all-people's vote'' because ``the authority of the head of state is
so important that only the people can decide,'' CTK reported.
   Earlier, Politburo member Ondrej Saling said the Communists and
opposition had agreed the president should be a Czech with no party
affiliation.
   ``In my view, the president must be someone who enjoys broad
support and guarantees stability,'' he said.
   That seemed to suggest Vaclav Havel, the playwright who was
jailed for opposing communism and is now the driving force behind
Civic Forum, the main opposition.
   Posters reading ``Havel na Hrad'' _ ``Havel to the Castle,'' the
presidential residence _ sprouted all over Prague.
   The candicacy of Alexander Dubcek, who led the 1968 reform as
party chief until Soviet tanks arrived, threw the result into
doubt, however, and other names were being mentioned.
   In a late-evening television interview with Soviet television,
shown in Prague, Havel said he would keep his country in the Warsaw
Pact.
   While evoking an ideal of Europe ``as a peaceful community''
with no military blocs, he said ``we shall not get any closer to
this ideal by any kind of individual split from the Warsaw treaty,''
   Havel's gravelly voice rolled over a crowd of 100,000 people
Sunday in Wenceslas Square. As he listed popular victories over the
past three weeks, which the people had come to celebrate, they
chanted ``We want Havel!'' and he made a very presidential bow.
   Dubcek, 68, remains a popular symbol but evokes little emotion
among younger Czechoslovaks, who regard him as a product of the
system they intend to abolish.
   He also is a Slovak, as is Marian Calfa, the new premier. Calfa
has said a political tradition, under which one office is held by a
Slovak and the other by a Czech, would be respected.
   Czechoslovakia joins Poland in forming an administration not
dominated by Communists, but unlike Poland, its government is led
by a member of the party.
   ``We have not won yet,'' Havel told the Sunday rally, which was
televised live. But, he added, ``The years-long, deadly silence of
a humiliated people has been drowned out by a multivoiced popular
choir.''
   A rally in support of Havel was held Monday at Plzen, west of
Prague, and many Czechoslovaks ringing bells around the country
also wore the ubiquitous blue, red and white ``Havel for
President'' buttons.
   The burst of bell-ringing occurred three weeks to the day after
students rose up, angered by brutal police assaults on peaceful
demonstrators. They surged through the streets of Prague, stopping
street cars to sound their bells, then everyone joined in.
   Soon afterward, a liberty bell appeared on a hill above Prague
where a statue of Stalin once had been. In letters visible across
the Vltava River, it was labeled, ``The final bell,'' the last line
of every Czechoslovak fairy tale.

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Monday Israel
wants guarantees from the United States that the PLO will have no
role in the peace process before he attends talks in Washington.
   No date has been set for the meeting between Arens, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmet
Abdel-Meguid. The three will discuss the composition of a
Palestinian delegation to direct talks with Israeli officials.
   In violence Monday in the occupied territories, troops shot and
wounded 14 Palestinian protesters, Arab hospital officials said.
The army said it was investigating.
   Arens cast some doubt Monday on his planned trip to Washington,
saying he is concerned about reports that Egypt is acting as a
``postman'' for the PLO.
   ``The Egyptians, who started the process as an independent
factor, have lately presented themselves as, in effect, a postman
for the PLO,'' Arens said on army radio. ``If this is what will be,
I fear that we won't get very far.''
   Last month, the Cabinet linked Israeli acceptance of Baker's
proposal for the Washington meeting to assurances that the PLO
would play no part in the peace process.
   Asked about the proposed Washington trip, Arens said, ``Firstly,
I'm not going yet. We will first conduct contacts concerning the
guarantees that our Cabinet has requested.''
   Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein is scheduled to go to
Washington this week to discuss the assurances sought by Israel,
said Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   The latest hitch in the talks followed weekend news reports that
Israeli, Egyptian, U.S. and Palestinian officials were holding
secret contacts to draw up a preliminary list of Palestinian
negotiators.
   The clashes Monday were sparked by the fatal shootings Sunday of
two Palestinians, apparently by Israeli civilians who opened fired
after their cars were stoned, Israeli and Arab reports said.
   The deaths raised to 631 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis during the two-year uprising against Israeli rule. At
least 155 other Palestinians have been killed by their fellow Arabs
who accused them of cooperating with Israeli authorities or
involvement in prostitution or drug-dealing. Forty-three Israelis
also have died.
   In Gaza City, a military court sentenced four Palestinian men to
prison terms ranging from 10 to 14 years for throwing firebombs at
military patrols in April 1989, a military spokesman said. No one
was injured in the attacks.
   In Jerusalem, police said they detained for questioning at least
21 Palestinian youths after the funeral of 17-year-old Joseph
Albert Muneir turned into a nationalist demonstration.
   Muneir's family claims he died Sunday as a result of beatings by
Israeli soldiers, but a police investigation reported he died of
natural causes.
   About 500 Arab youths marched behind Muneir's coffin, singing
the Palestinian national anthem and waving the outlawed red, white,
black and green Palestinian flag. Nearly 100 police and
paramilitary border policemen stood guard.
   Israel's military administration of the occupied territories
ordered the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to keep
the 90 schools it operates for Palestinian refugees in the occupied
West Bank closed until the new academic year begins Jan. 10.
   A spokesman for the administration said all 930 schools in the
West Bank will remain closed until then.
   The schools have been closed since the school year ended Nov. 1.
   UNRWA had announced its schools would reopen Monday to give
students a chance to complete the past academic year. The students
were unable to complete the full year because many schools have
been closed frequently during the uprising.

<HEAD>Peru in Pact with International Monetary Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After four years of disagreements, the
International Monetary Fund announced Monday it has reached an
accord with Peru that could mean financial aid for the country if
Peruvian policies meet its approval.
   An official of the fund, who spoke on condition he not be named,
said Peru had made a payment of $42.3 million the $800 million it
owes the fund. The payment covers only the arrears since September
of this year.
   Peru has been in trouble with lenders since President Alan
Garcia was elected in 1985 and announced that he would make only
partial payments of interest on the country's debts. At that time
Peru owed $14 billion abroad. Now the figure is closer to $20
billion.
   Its financial troubles have been worsened by the continuing
rebellion of a strong leftist group, the Shining Path, and a
thriving traffic in drugs.
   Owned by 152 governments, the fund negotiates at length with
those in financial trouble. It gives its help only when the
borrowing government agrees on a set of policies it approves.
Usually these include cuts in government spending, especially on
official payrolls and subsidies, and often a devaluation of the
country's currency.
   Peru is one of 10 countries with a total arrears of $3.5 billion
to the fund, and so ineligible for more finanical aid from it _ and
in practice, unlikely to get much from anyone else. This year the
fund started a series of what it called ``shadow programs,'' under
which governments promised new policies but got no immediate money.
Vietnam, Guayana, Zambia, Somalia and now Peru have started such
programs.
   If the fund finds they are doing well after a year or so, they
will start getting its financial help.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS new grafs 13-14 with White House statement on apprehension.
Picks up 13th pvs, `Interior Minister ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luis Arce Gomez was flown to the Miami on
Monday for trial on charges of trafficking in drugs while he was
interior minister in a former Bolivian military government.
   He has been accused of leading a cocaine trafficking operation
while he was Bolivia's top law enforcement official. He also hired
Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie to advise paramilitary forces that
tortured and killed opposition political and labor figures.
   A U.S. indictment in Miami alleges that Bolivian secret police
under his control seized cocaine from traffickers who failed to pay
for protection, and delivered it to smugglers who did pay.
   Two lieutenants of Arce Gomez who were charged with him once
received $1.5 million for cocaine that was confiscated by Bolivian
authorities and stored in bank vaults, according to the indictment.
It says Arce Gomez personally ordered the cocaine released.
   ``He was indicted along with 18 other individuals and charged
with various violations of the criminal drug laws of the United
States,'' said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's
office in Miami.
   ``Specifically, the charges involved conspiracies related to the
importation, distribution and intent to distribute narcotics,'' she
said.
   Arce Gomez had a reputation for ruthlessness and for personally
torturing political prisoners.
   He was named interior minister in 1980 and rounded up hundreds
of journalists, political and labor leaders and church officials.
Under U.S. pressure, he was removed from office in 1981.
   Arce Gomez fled to Argentina in 1982 and was arrested under the
Miami indictment, but the military government there freed him in
December 1983, just before turning over power to the civilian
administration of President Raul Alfonsin.
   His whereabouts were not known until he was captured Sunday at a
ranch near Santa Cruz, a hub for drug traffickers 350 miles east of
La Paz. He offered no resistance when hundreds of police officers
arrived at the ranch.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard told The Associated Press: ``We
think it was a couragous act by the Bolivian government to capture
this man, who not only was and is an important cocaine trafficker
but was also responsible to a great extent for the growth of the
cocaine trade.''
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah republican, said Monday at the end
of a one-day visit to Bolivia: ``We are pleased that criminals like
this are being dealt with in this matter and we hope to assist in
any way we can.''
   In Washington, the White House said in a statement, ``Bolivia
today has apprehended and turned over to the United States Luis
Arce Gomez, who has been a fugitive from U.S. justice since 1983.
Gomez was wanted in the Southern District of Florida where he has
been charged with two counts of drug trafficking along with
co-defendant Anna de Tamayo Rodriguez, who was recently extradited
from Colombia.
   ``The arrest of Arce Gomez sends a message that the president
will work with other goverments to pursue vigorously individuals
who traffic in drugs.''
   Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco said he had advised and
received support from Bolivia's main political parties for sending
Arce Gomez to Miami.
   Arce Gomez was stripped of Bolivian citizenship last year for
failing to show up for trial in this country on charges of human
rights violations and cocaine trafficking.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, calling drunken driving ``one
of the most deadly scourges'' of our times, promised Monday to keep
up pressures to get intoxicated drivers off the road. His
transportation secretary suggested new restrictions on alcohol
advertising may be necessary.
   Their comments came at a briefing at the White House for 150
anti-drunken driving activists plus health and safety officials.
   Bush signed legislation declaring this National Drunk and
Drugged Driving Awareness Week and issued a proclamation saying,
``As we prepare to celebrate the holidays and rejoice in the
promise of the new year, it is fitting that we pause to remember
the perils of drinking and driving.''
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner was peppered with
questions before Bush spoke about why the government does not raise
excise taxes on alcohol to discourage drinking and does not
restrict brewers' and liquor manufacturers' ads.
   ``I'm not so sure it isn't time to revisit those issues'' of
regulating advertising, said Skinner.
   Skinner said people are ``not going to stop drinking,'' but said
they must be stopped ``from getting behind the steering wheel.''
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan was more direct, telling the
briefing that the nation should ``consider some form of
restrictions on the advertising of alcoholic beverages.''
   Bush said the public outcry in recent years against drunken
drivers has been ``one of the most amazing success stories of the
1980s.''
   Drunken driving deaths fell 20 percent in the last six years,
although the number of miles traveled rose 25 percent, Bush said.
   Still, almost 500,000 Americans are injured in alcohol-related
accidents and half the 50,000 fatalities on America's highways each
year are alcohol-related, ``an annual toll that would nearly fill
the polished granite walls of the Vietnam Memorial,'' Bush said.
   He called drunken driving ``one of the most deadly scourges ever
to strike modern times. And it's as crippling as crack, as random
as gang violence. And it's killing more kids than both combined.''
   To those who have crusaded against drunken driving, Bush said,
``speaking not only as president, but as a father and as a
grandfather, you have my respect, my admiration and my thanks.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, a Kentucky senator urged motorists
to turn on their headlights for three hours on the last day of
December to remind other drivers not to drink and drive on New
Year's Eve.
   ``And it will be a memorial to all those victims of drunk
driving who will not be with us to celebrate the dawn of the new
decade,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at a news conference.

   A grain bin filled to capacity with shelled
corn partially collapsed Monday morning, suffocating a man and
injuring two others, the Huron County Sheriff's Department said.
   Patrick W. Dufty, 34, of Caseville was pronounced dead at Huron
Memorial Hospital in Bad Axe following the 8 a.m. accident at the
Elkton branch of the Pigeon Cooperative Elevator in Michigan's
Thumb region, the department said.
   Dufty, a trucking company employee, and two other men were
inside the bin, preparing to transfer its 650,000 bushels of corn
to silos along railroad tracks 500 feet away, Deputy Elwood Smith
said.
   An inside support bracket broke loose and hundreds of bushels of
corn spilled out, burying Dufty for nearly an hour, Smith said.
   The other men were partially buried but escaped and were treated
and discharged from Huron Memorial Hospital, the deputy said.
   The sheriff's department and the state Occupational Safety and
Health Administration were investigating the incident, Smith said.

   Two explosions seven minutes
apart rocked downtown Johannesburg, killing two people and damaging
the main train station, police said early Tuesday.
   The first blast at 11:30 p.m. Monday killed two men believed to
be Indians, said police spokesman Col. Hennie Heymans. He said
police suspected a limpet mine was used. The second blast was heard
throughout downtown but police could not determine the location
after searching for more than an hour.
   No one claimed responsibility and Heymans declined to speculate
on who may have been involved.
   More than 100 bombings have hit South Africa since a state of
emergency was declared in June 1986. Most were blamed on the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, which is
based in Lusaka, Zambia, and is fighting to undermine white
domination.
   About 16,000 transportation workers have been on strike since
Nov. 2. Management has blamed them for arson and sabotage attacks
that have caused more than $8 million in property damage.
   Earlier, police said 16 blacks were killed Sunday and 65 homes
destroyed in factional fighting in Natal Province. About 2,000
people have died since late 1986 in battles among blacks there.
   Fire and hospital officials said four blacks were killed, eight
injured and more than 100 homes were razed on Sunday in arson
attacks related to a power struggle in the Crossroads shantytown
outside Cape Town.
   In Cape Town on Monday, Supreme Court Justice D.M. Williamson
acquitted an army officer and 12 policemen of murder in the case of
a boy shot dead in 1985 by officers hidden in crates on an unmarked
truck. It was the first murder trial held under a law allowing
private citizens to press prosecution in certain cases in which the
government declines to do so.
   Williamson said the officers did not act with premeditation in
the 1985 shooting death of Shaun Magoed, 16.
   The white officers concealed themselves in what looked like an
ordinary delivery truck that was driven into a mixed-raced township
near Cape Town during anti-apartheid unrest.
   Magoed and two other youths were killed after they threw stones
at the truck in a case that became known as the ``Trojan Horse
incident.''
   Williamson advised police to stop such operations, saying they
could endanger innocent people.
   Magoed's father pursued the case on his own after the Cape
Province attorney general declined to prosecute.

   More than 150,000 people rallied
for democracy in this southern industrial city Monday night, with
shouting matches breaking out for a fourth straight week over
whether Germany should reunite.
   ``We in Leipzig and those in Hanover (West Germany) are and will
remain Germans,'' one speaker said, to roared approval from some
and boos from others. ``What belongs together will grow together.''
   ADN, the official news agency, said 40,000 people demonstrated
at Karl-Marx-Stadt for a referendum on reunification before
elections planned in May. It said the crowd also demanded that
cells of the discredited Communist Party be disbanded by Dec. 15.
   Other rallies took place in Dresden, Neubrandenburg, Halle and
Potsdam, the agency reported. It said the Dresden crowd also
divided on the reunification issue.
   It was the fourth week German unity was a central issue of
Leipzig's regular Monday night rally.
   Dozens of West German flags waved in the crowd. Some
demonstrators carried signs saying ``No Fourth Reich'' and urging
East Germans not to let their country become a West German
``plantation.''
   ``There are two real movements now,'' said a young woman opposed
to reunification. ``It's too bad it's come to this.''
   In West Germany, ZDF television said: ``The fear of a deep
division within the opposition is huge, because of the different
goals.''
   Throughout the evening, protesters on both sides shouted at each
other.
   Reunification has become an increasingly bitter topic for East
Germany's New Forum opposition group, which sponsors the Leipzig
rallies. New Forum says reunification would mean a ``sellout'' to
West Germany.
   Calls for and against German unity were not the only demands.
Many demonstrators warned fellow East Germans against ``attacks and
taking law into their own hands.''
   As they press their beleaguered government to carry through with
promises of reforms, East Germans have increasingly been swept up
in a frenzy to root out corruption, leading to many warnings
against the use of violence.
   Monday night's protest was sponsored by the 200,000-member New
Forum, the nation's largest opposition group. The organization said
Monday it will take part as a political party in the nation's first
free election, slated for May 6, and will hope to form its own
parliamentary group.
   A national congress of New Forum to launch the group as a party
will be held in Leipzig on Jan. 6-7.
   Another opposition group, Demokratischer Aufbruch, which means
democratic ``start'' or ``awakening,'' called on the government to
pass immediate regulations allowing foreign companies to transfer
their profits out of the country and that would guarantee
protection of investments.
   Earlier Monday, the official East German news agency ADN said
new Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi spoke by telephone with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and that the two men had
agreed to meet soon.
   Gorbachev praised the party's ``rejection of attempts to damage
the sovereignty of the country,'' ADN said.
   The questions of East German sovereignty have become
increasingly important with the growing turmoil in the Communist
nation. There have been predictions the rapid changes could lead to
steps toward unification with West Germany.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union is watching the East German
situation with ``extraordinary attention'' and promised Moscow
would consider providing support ``within the current framework of
conditions.''
   Gysi said he is counting on Soviet backing in rebuilding the
Communist Party and enacting democratic reform, ADN said.
   ADN did not specify a date for their meeting.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Desegregation Settlement, Blasts School Districts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday approved the
$130 million settlement of the largest desegregation case in
Arkansas history, but blasted school districts for suggesting the
money be used to retire debts.
   U.S. District Judge Henry Woods, saying it was ``abundantly
clear'' the parties in the case could not be trusted with the
money, ordered it put in an escrow account monitored by a
court-appointed supervisor.
   ``The amount of money is meager enough,'' Woods wrote in his
opinion.
   The judge also scaled back NACCP attorneys' fees in the case
from $3.15 million to $850,000.
   The settlement ends seven years of litigation involving the
state, three school districts in Pulaski County, which includes
Little Rock, and black students' parents.
   The Little Rock School District, which is mostly black, sued the
state and the neighboring, mostly white North Little Rock and
Pulaski County districts, alleging the defendants caused illegal
segregation in Little Rock schools.
   The settlement was reached in March. In a special session in
July, the state Legislature agreed to spend $129.75 million over 10
years for desegregation programs.
   Woods on Monday endorsed the agreement as approved Oct. 4 by
Special Master Aubrey McCutcheon.
   Attorneys for the county and North Little Rock districts had
objected to revisions recommended by McCutcheon, saying the court
should accept the settlement intact.
   McCutcheon recommended that the court have the right to order
the construction or repair of magnet schools and that court forbid
the districts from spending settlement money to retire deficits
unrelated to desegregation.
   Woods said Monday that the districts had no right to challenge
the court's jurisdiction because they'd failed to draft a
constitutional student assignment plan.
   ``That the districts would default in their responsibilities,
then attempt to bind this court by `bargaining' with each other as
to what remedies the court-appointed expert could or could not use,
is incredible,'' he said. ``The parties have bound themselves.
There is a settlement.''
   Woods said his major objection was the North Little Rock and the
Pulaski districts' suggestion that the money could be used to pay
off debts.
   Woods, however, ruled that the Little Rock district had $5.5
million in debts attributed to desegregation that could be paid
with settlement money and that the Pulaski County district had $1.4
million in such debts.
   The judge refused to grant $2.3 million in attorneys' fees the
settlement assigned to the Legal Defense Fund of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   He said the Little Rock district shouldn't pay $2 million to the
defense fund because the district played the leading role in
pressing the lawsuit, no substantial documents or time records were
filed to support the claims, and the defense fund tried to recoup
fees going back to 1957.
   In 1957, then-Gov. Orval Faubus refused to allow nine black
students to enter Little Rock's all-white Central High School.
President Eisenhower ordered federal troops to Central High to keep
the peace and enforce court-ordered desegregation.

<TEXT>
   Campaigning for elections to pick a
successor to military President Augusto Pinochet ended late Monday
when tens of thousands of supporters held a street rally for
pro-government candidate Hernan Buchi.
   Both supporters and opponents of Buchi skirmished briefly with
police at the end of the demonstration, and authorities used water
cannon to scatter the crowds from downtown streets. There were no
reports of injuries or arrests.
   Chileans vote Thursday for a president and congress to replace
the right-wing government of Pinochet, who has ruled since seizing
power in a violent 1973 coup. By law, all campaigning had to end
Monday, 48 hours before election day.
   Supporters of Buchi, a 40-year-old former finance minister for
Pinochet, packed several blocks of a downtown avenue on a warm
spring night in the Southern Hemisphere and cheered as the
candidate predicted an upset victory.
   ``We are going to give them a big surprise,'' he told the crowd.
   Buchi is considering an underdog to opposition candidate
Patricio Aylwin, who holds a lead of about 20 percentage points in
most pre-election polls.
   Aylwin, a Christian Democrat who is backed by a coalition of 17
centrist and leftist parties, held his final rally on Sunday,
drawing hundreds of thousands of people to the city's biggest park.
   Police said they had no immediate estimate of the Buchi rally
turnout, which appeared much smaller than that of Aylwin. Buchi's
campaign chief, Pablo Baraona, declined to give an estimate.
   In his speech, Buchi pledged that if elected ``we will have a
real democracy, with a government that will listen to the people.''
   He criticized Aylwin's willingness to accept support from
leftist groups, and predicted that if Aylwin wins, the country
would return to the social disorder that marked the elected
government of former President Salvador Allende, a Marxist who died
during the '73 coup.
   ``The crucial option in the election is not between left and
right, but between moving ahead or moving backwards.''
   When the rally ended, participants marched into the center along
the main Bernardo O'Higgins Avenue toward the presidential palace.
Police halted their progress blocks away, and used water cannon to
disperse them as well as to spray youths who were taunting the
Buchi supporters.
   Police have said they would treat both pro- and anti-government
elements equally during an election period they said would be free
and fair.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election when he lost a
referendum last year on a proposal that he remain in power until
1997. He has vowed to stay on as commander of the country's
powerful 60,000-man army after the new government takes power March
11.

   Croatia, the second largest state in
Yugoslavia, for the first time demanded Monday that a multiparty
political system be set up in this communist country.
   Until now, the liberal northern state of Slovenia had been the
only one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics to openly
advocate introduction of Western-style democracy.
   The Communist leadership of Serbia, the most populous state with
42 percent of Yugoslavia's 23 million people, vigorously opposes
the change. Croatia has about 20 percent of the population.
   The State Department said in Washington on Monday that it was
worried by rising tensions in Yugoslavia and urged the people to
unite in support of the reform efforts of Prime Minister Ante
Markovic.
   Stanko Stojicevic, head of the Croatian Communist Party's ruling
presidium (Politburo), said Monday that Communists have been slow
in realizing the ``historic exhaustion of the single-party system.''
   In a keynote speech opening a regional party congress in the
Croatian capital of Zagreb, Stojicevic said, ``There can be no
democratic socialism without political pluralism based on the right
of association and competition of political (movements) and
programs.''
   The speech was carried by the state news agency Tanjug.
   About a dozen independent movements and parties have been set up
in Slovenia the past year, and the region plans to hold its first
free legislative elections next March.
   About 25,000 Croatians in several cities signed a petition
Sunday urging legalization of numerous parties that would make it
possible to hold free elections in the Croatian republic, which
borders Slovenia.
   In an apparent move to stifle growing democratic trends in
Yugoslavia, Serbia this month cut all business and official ties
with Slovenia. The action shook the foundations of Yugoslavia's
loose federal system.
   Stojicevic denounced Serbia's break with Slovenia, describing
the consequences as ``dramatic with a possibly catastrophic
outcome.''
   He said, ``Ultimatums and the severance of economic relations,
accusations and threats represent a direct attack on the
constitutional order of the country and its economic and political
integrity.''
   Slovenian President Janez Stanovnik told the region's parliament
on Monday that Serbia's move dealt a ``heavy blow to the Yugoslav
federation'' and was meant to ``eliminate all those who hold
differing opinions and to produce a change of the constitutional
order.'
   At a session devoted exclusively to the break, Stanovnik told
deputies, ``The blockade of Slovenia, therefore, represents an act
of aggression against Yugoslavia.''
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said when when asked about ethnic problems in Yugoslavia:
   ``We are greatly concerned by the growing tensions and conflicts
among the republics and national groups that make up Yugoslavia.
Mutual respect, adherence to democratic principles, and a
commitment to avoiding violence are crucial to resolving this
situation.
   ``The U.S. supports and will continue to support a united
federal Yugoslavia in which human rights and civil rights of all
citizens are protected.
   ``The U.S. strongly supports the ongoing efforts of ... Prime
Minister Markovich to create a market-based economy and to promote
greater political pluralism. We urge all Yugoslavs to put aside
their differences and to focus their energies on this important
reform effort.''

<HEAD>Report 7 Inmates Killed, 3 Missing, in Prison Riots Over Amnesty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riots at four prisons, sparked by
legislative rejection of an amnesty measure, left at least seven
inmates killed, scores of guards injured and extensive damage,
authorities reported Monday.
   They said three prisoners were missing, possibly killed by a
fire that swept thorugh a bakery storehouse at the Czarne
penitentiary.
   The riots began late Thursday after the Sejm _ lower house of
Parliament _ turned down a Senate proposal to extend the
Solidarity-led government's amnesty program to repeat offenders.
   Solidarity members of Parliament proposed the extended amnesty
to give prisoners another chance under the new government. Many
Poles protested, fearing a mass release of hardened criminals.
   The riots were quelled over the weekend when the government
authorized the use of force.
   Some inmates surrendered as police and guards prepared assaults
and others gave up as police moved in using tear gas and water
cannons, according to the state PAP news agency.
   Col. Jan Swieczynski, a police spokesman, said the law
enforcement forces did not use firearms.
   The worst rioting was at the Czarne prison, in northwestern
Poland near the Baltic, which holds 1,500 inmates.
   Control was regained after a 50-minute battle. PAP reported
authorities found the bodies of four prisoners who had been hanged,
apparently by fellow inmates, and said two others were killed by
bullets. PAP said the prison commander, Capt. Andrzej Laminski, had
ordered an investigation into the deaths.
   The burned body of one inmate was found in a fire-gutted cell at
the Goleniow prison, also in northern Poland.
   Goleniow, with 1,000 prisoners, and another prison in the
region, Nowogard with 850 inmates, were severely damaged by fires,
PAP said. Rioting also was suppressed at the Kaminski penitentirary
that houses about 1,000 inmates.
   Laminski told PAP that 800 Czarne inmates were transferred to
other prisons.
   All four prisons are maximum security facilities.
   About 17,000 prisoners were expected to benefit from the amnesty
program approved by the Sejm but it was not applied to those with
four or more convictions.

   A 9-year-old girl being airlifted out of
mountains for a sprained ankle fell about 30 feet from a
helicopter's air-rescue litter, suffering serious head and internal
injuries, officials said.
   Debbie Baisa was in critical but stable condition Monday at
William Beaumont Army Medical Center following Saturday's accident
just north of El Paso, according to Fort Bliss spokesman Brad Rose.
   Debbie regained consciousness Monday, said Manny Baisa, the
girl's grandfather. ``She's doing incredibly well, considering what
she's gone through,'' Baisa said.
   The girl underwent surgery for a broken hip Sunday evening, he
said. ``It's her third surgery. ... She already had surgery for her
head and internal bleeding.''
   Baisa said Debbie's family plans to pursue an investigation of
the accident.
   ``A sprained ankle turned into a disaster,'' he said. ``We
appreciate that emergency workers were trying to help, but somebody
didn't do their job right. It should never have happened.''
   Debbie was hiking in the Franklin Mountains Saturday afternoon
with her father, Dan, and cousins when she hurt her ankle. ``Danny
said he tried to carry her down, but it was too steep and it was
getting dark, so he sent for help,'' Manny Baisa said.
   The El Paso Police Department Mountain Rescue Team reached
Debbie and strapped her to a litter but could not carry her down
because of the windswept mountain's steepness and the coming
darkness, said police Lt. J.R. Grijalva.
   An Army helicopter from Fort Bliss was called in to take the
girl off the mountain. A medic lowered from the copter checked the
airlift litter.
   But when the helicopter lifted off the ground, the litter began
spinning. The pilot tried to stop it, then attempted to put the
litter back on the ground, but Debbie was thrown out by centrifugal
force, Rose said.
   Manny Baisa said his son told him that Debbie's litter began
spinning ``almost as soon as they lifted it off the ground. It
wasn't even, it was on an angle with her head on the lowest part.''
   Grijalva said he believed the police team followed the correct
procedures.
   The accident is being investigated, Rose and Grijalva said.

<TEXT>
   Seeking to silence the debunkers, the National
Geographic Society laid out the results of a year's investigation
Monday in an attempt to prove that Adm. Robert E. Peary discovered
the North Pole exactly where and when he said he had.
   Peary's grandson, Edward Peary Stafford, a retired Navy
commander, said doubters still willing to dispute Peary's claim,
``should join the Flat Earth Society.''
   ``The family is vindicated,'' Stafford declared.
   National Geographic President Gilbert Grosvenor said the results
of the analysis by the Navigation Foundation, an organization of
scientists, should end an 80-year dispute over Peary's claim.
   But he said he suspected doubters would persist, as they have
for 80 years.
   The foundation said it had established that the dog sleds led by
Peary had come at least within five miles of his destination on
April 6, 1909 _ close enough to deserve his title as the pole's
discoverer.
   But Baltimore astronomer Dennis Rawlins said he remained
convinced Peary had not gotten within 100 miles of the North Pole.
Rawlins is the author of a 1973 book which says Peary perpetuated
the greatest scientific hoax of the century.
   He said the foundation, which conducted the research at the
behest and the expense of the Geographic Society, had produced a
``whitewash.''
   ``Bias can do a lot, and when you want to believe something it
is easy to,'' Rawlins said. ``It is a tragedy for American
science.''
   At a 95-minute news conference, retired Adm. Thomas D. Davies,
president of the foundation, said Peary's claims were supported by
scientific means.
   Among these, he said, were a study of the shadows in Peary's
photographs and of the depth measurements the explorer made by
dropping a piece of lead tied to piano wire in holes in the ice.
Modern maps verify Peary's depth soundings, Davies said.
   ``Our analysis of the data Peary brought back from his journey _
his celestial sights, his diary, his ocean sounding and his
photographs _ has convinced us that their final camp, named Camp
Jesup, was no more than five miles from the Pole, allowing for some
inaccuracy in their instruments,'' the foundation said in a
240-page report.
   From the start, Peary's claim that he and companion Matthew
Henson and four Eskimos reached the pole has been wrapped in
controersy.
   A week before Peary got home, another explorer, Frederick Cook,
said he had beaten Peary by a year _ a claim that generated
inch-high newspaper headlines. Cook's claim was eventually rejected
and Congress certified Peary as the discoverer in 1911.
   But the issue reopened in 1983 when a television docudrama gave
the credit to Cook.
   Then came Rawlins with a new claim of proof that Peary had never
made it. He cited a worksheet bearing what he thought were Peary's
compass readings.
   The foundation investigated and said the numbers were readings
from chronometers made on an earlier expedition. Rawlins admitted
he was wrong.
   But on Monday he still insisted that Peary had missed.
   The photo analysis cited by Davies used a technique that
determines the angle of the elevation of the sun from the shadows
in the picture. With knowledge of the dates and times when the
pictures were made, the photographer's location can be determined.
   ``We regard the photogrammetric analysis of the photographs as
the most innovative and significant contribution thus far made to
the dispute,'' the foundation said.
   British explorer Wally Herbert concluded in 1988 that Peary had
not taken account of westward ice drifts which would have put him
55 or 60 miles away from his destination. But the foundation said
its study of Arctic ice drift flows showed that Herbert had not
taken into account a subsequent rapid eastward movement of the ice.

   A record promoter convicted of giving cocaine
``payola'' to a Fresno radio program director was sentenced Monday
to 60 days in a halfway house and fined $100,000.
   Ralph Tashjian, 41, of San Mateo also was ordered to perform 500
hours of community service and serve three years probation.
   Tashjian pleaded guilty to one count of payola in the case, in
which drugs were given in exchange for radio play for records. He
also pleaded guilty to single counts of tax fraud and obstructing
justice.
   Under federal law, it is illegal to pay radio personnel to play
records without disclosing the payment to the government.
   Tashjian worked for Joseph Isgro, 42, an independent promoter
indicted last week on charges of payola, racketeering, obstruction
of justice, tax fraud and other charges.
   Tashijian's plea bargain requires that he testify for the
government.
   Another former Isgro associate and promoter, William Craig, 44,
pleaded guilty in October to one payola count and two counts of tax
fraud.
   Ex-Columbia Records executive Raymond Anderson, 49, is accused
of taking kickbacks from Isgro in exchange for giving him promotion
work involving payola.

<HEAD>Study Says Fears Over Foreign Investment in U.S. Unwarranted</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS one graf on institute background</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign ownership of U.S. factories, banks and
other businesses has escalated in recent years, but most fears
about adverse economic consequences from foreign control are
unwarranted, concludes a study released Monday by a Washington
research group.
   The Institute for International Economics said that, contrary to
some arguments, the growth of foreign ownership has not translated
into a loss of jobs for Americans and that foreign-owned firms paid
their U.S. workers the same as domestic firms.
   The institute argued against changing any U.S. laws to block
foreign investment, saying that even in the area of national
security the growth of foreign ownership was not of concern.
   ``Even with the recent growth in foreign ownership, foreign
firms play a smaller role in the U.S. economy than in the Canadian
and major European economies,'' wrote the authors of the report,
Paul Krugman, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and Edwin M. Graham, a business professor at Duke
University.
   The study said that foreign firms accounted for 7 percent of
total U.S. employment in manufacturing in 1986 compared to 21
percent in France, 14 percent in Britain and 13 percent in West
Germany. By contrast, foreign-owned firms employed only 1 percent
of manufacturing workers in Japan, a country with a tradition of
making foreign investment difficult.
   ``If one country invests heavily in another country, which
country has given the most hostages?'' Krugman asked at a news
conference where the report was released. ``Japan is going to find
that it has a very great stake in what the U.S. government decides
when it discovers that it has a rather large part of its national
wealth invested inside the U.S. borders.''
   The new report, ``Foreign Direct Investment in the United
States,'' analyzed the rapid growth in foreign direct investment.
To count as foreign ownership, the foreign firm must own at least
10 percent of a U.S. business.
   The heavy purchases by foreigners, in particular the Japanese,
have triggered concern in Congress and elsewhere that the United
States is selling off its economic destiny to foreigners.
   The Commerce Department reported that foreign direct investment
in U.S. real estate and businesses totaled $328.9 billion in 1988,
the first year that foreign direct ownership in the United States
surpassed U.S. ownership overseas, which totaled $326.9 billion.
   While Britain continued as the country with the largest stake in
the United States, holding 31 percent of total foreign-held assets,
Japan climbed into the No. 2 spot with 16.2 percent of the total,
ahead of the Netherlands, which held 14.9 percent.
   While purchases of prime real estate and Hollywood movie studios
by the Japanese grabbed the headlines, the most dramatic inroads by
the Japanese have come in banking, according to the institute's
study.
   It reported that the Japanese in 1988 controlled 52.2 percent of
the U.S. banking assets held by foreign banks, far ahead of the
second biggest foreign holder, Canada, which controls 7.1 percent.
   The institute said that growing foreign leadership in
high-technology industries posed new problems in meeting U.S.
military needs. As a partial solution, the study proposed making it
mandatory for foreign companies making sales to the Pentagon to
establish manufacturing plants in the United States.
   The Institute for International Economics is a non-profit
research institute created in 1981 through a grant from the German
Marshall Fund of the United States, an independent endowment
created by the West German government. It now receives 15 percent
of its funds from the German Marshall Fund with other resources
coming from U.S. foundations including the Ford Foundation and the
William and Flora Hewlitt Foundation.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BULGARIA _ Communist Party chief Petar Mladenov proposed that
Bulgaria hold free elections in May and remove the party's
guarantee of exclusive power from the constitution.
   While the party Central Committee heard Mladenov, a Sofia court
registered Eco-Glasnost, an ecological group, as Bulgaria's first
independent organization. Mladenov said a new constitution should
be drafted by the end of next year, leaving out any guarantee of
Communist Party power.

   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ A ringing of bells and car horns heralded a
popular victory over the Communists, and Czechoslovaks settled down
to choosing a president from among heroes the old order called
villains.
   A presidential contest appeared to be developing, and the people
may get to decide. The brief blast of noise replaced a threatened
general strike, canceled after events brought to power the first
government in 41 years not dominated by Communists and drove
President Gustav Husak from office.
   ``This is the end of communism!'' exulted Jana Navara, an
actress in pink mukluks.

   EAST GERMANY _ More than 150,000 people rallied for democracy in
this southern industrial city, with shouting matches erupting for a
fourth straight week over whether Germany should reunite.
   ADN, the official news agency, said 40,000 people demonstrated
at Karl-Marx-Stadt for a referendum on reunification before
elections planned in May. It said the crowd also demanded that
cells of the discredited Communist Party be disbanded by Dec. 15.
   Other rallies took place in Dresden, Neubrandenburg, Halle and
Potsdam, the agency reported. It said the Dresden crowd also
divided on the reunification issue.

   HUNGARY _ Three Hungarian journalists who went to Romania last
week to meet a dissident clergyman were detained by police,
expelled from the country and banned from re-entering for five
years, it was reported. Police also confiscated their film and
videocassettes.
   Szilvia Izso, a reporter for Nepszabadsag, the official
newspaper of the ruling Socialist Party, and two other reporters of
a regional newspaper went to Romania Thursday to interview
Protestant clergyman Laszlo Toekes, who has been harassed for his
criticism of human rights violations in Romania.

   POLAND _ Riots at four prisons involving legislative rejection
of an amnesty measure left at least seven inmates killed, scores of
guards injured and extensive damage, authorities reported.
   They said three prisoners were missing, possibly killed by a
fire that swept through a bakery storehouse at the Czarne
penitentiary. The riots began Thursday after the lower house of
Parliament turned down a Senate proposal to extend the
Solidarity-led government's amnesty program to repeat offenders.
   Also, authorities in the southern steel town of Nowa Huta have
quietly removed a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin that youthful
demonstrators have repeatedly defaced and tried to destroy.

   SOVIET UNION _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev clashed with Communist Party
conservatives at a tense, 10-hour Central Committee meeting that
included an especially harsh personal attack, according to accounts.
   When the doors opened Saturday, however, the 58-year-old Kremlin
leader emerged ``in excellent shape,'' a participant said.
   A two-hour general strike called by human rights activist Andrei
D. Sakharov appeared to fizzle, with only 1,500 participants
reported in Moscow and scattered support around the country.
Scientists at research institutes were the main workers to heed the
strike call to demand an end to Communist Party domination.
   Also, preliminary results of weekend local elections in Latvia
show the grassroots People's Front gaining over half the vote in
most regions and winning landslides in the countryside, an activist
said.

   YUGOSLAVIA _ Croatia, the second largest state in Yugoslavia,
for the first time demanded a multiparty political system be set up
in this communist country.
   Until now, the liberal northern state of Slovenia had been the
only one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics to openly
advocate introduction of Western-style democracy. The Communist
leadership of Serbia, the most populous state with 42 percent of
Yugoslavia's 23 million people, opposes the change.

   The wife of Col. William Higgins, the U.N.
peacekeeping soldier who was kidnapped and reported executed in
Lebanon, on Monday accused the United Nations of making its forces
``sitting ducks'' by failing to ensure their safety.
   Higgins, a U.S. Marine officer, was serving with U.N.
peacekeeping forces in Lebanon when he was abducted in February
1988. Last August, a group called the Organization of the Oppressed
on Earth claimed to have executed him in retaliation for the
Israeli kidnapping of a Moslem cleric in Lebanon.
   Higgins' body has not been recovered.
   ``Member nations must put substance behind rhetoric. That means
expressing outrage at outrageous situations and taking concrete
steps to ensure that U.N. peacekeepers are not cannon fodder for
political dreams,'' said Robin Higgins, a Marine major, in an
address to U.N. staff.
   ``I never understood why the Secretary-General failed to assign
either a team or an individual whose sole mission was to secure
Col. Higgins' release,'' she said, according to a text of her
remarks.
   ``If the U.N. cannot ensure the safety of the men and women it
sends to keep the peace, then they are mere sitting ducks for the
thugs and bullies who roam borders at odds and we, the members of
the international community, are in fact sending them to their
deaths,'' she said.

<HEAD>Guam's Former Governor Sentenced To Four Years In Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Richardo Bordallo was resentenced
Tuesday to four years in federal prison and fined $10,000 for
witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
   Bordallo, who served as governor of this U.S. territory in the
Western Pacific from 1982 to 1986, was convicted in 1987 of 10
counts and sentenced to nine years in prison for allegedly
exchanging political favors for payoffs, but a federal appeals
court last year reversed eight of those counts and set aside the
sentence.
   Bordallo, who turned 62 on Monday, will pay his own way to the
U.S. mainland and report to the federal prison, once the Bureau of
Prisons has made an assignment, said Bordallo's attorney Howard
Trapp.
   Mike Cruz, of the federal probation office here, said
notification of where Bordallo is to report could come in as little
as two weeks.
   Bordallo, who met briefly with supporters outside the courtroom
but declined to talk to reporters, remains free on his own
recognizance.
   During his trial, federal proseuctors said Bordallo approved
government contracts and permits for various firms in exchange for
payments, mostly delivered to him in unmarked envelopes.
   The money was described by the donors as campaign contributions
or gifts, but never was reported by Bordallo in his campaign
statements, authorities said.
   He also was accused of approving a $103,000 government contract
for a company that agreed to hire his campaign manager.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said four bribery-realted
convictions were reversed because the federal crime of bribery
applies only to state officials and Guam is a territory.
   It said four extortion-related convictions were reversed because
the jury was not told it must find Bordallo demanded or otherwise
inducted the payoffs, totaling $79,600 in cash.
   The appeals court upheld the convictions of witness tampering
and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
   U.S. District Judge Cristobal Duenas resentenced Bordallo to
four years and fined him $5,000 on the witness tampering charge and
gave him a three-year suspended sentence on the conspiracy charge
and fined him $5,000.
   Bordallo, a Democrat elected in 1982, was indicted a few days
before the 1986 Democratic primary. He won the primary, but was
defeated in November 1986 by Republican Joseph Ada.

<HEAD>Canadian Naval Destroyer Pursues U.S. Scalloper For Alleged Illegal
Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian naval destroyer Monday fired a shot
across the bow of an American scalloper that allegedly rammed it
three times, Coast Guard officials said.
   The 366-foot destroyer Sagueny fired a 3-inch round at 6:52 p.m.
near George's Bank after chasing the 114-foot scalloper Concordia
for eight hours, said Petty Officer Ellen Harrington.
   The Concordia did not stop or attempt to make radio contact
after the warning shot was fired, said Harrington. She said the
vessel continued to steam west towards Cape Cod and its home port
of Fairhaven.
   The Sagueny followed it until 8:50 p.m., when it entered U.S.
waters.
   The scalloper was allegedly spotted fishing 2.5 miles across the
Hague fisheries line by a Canadian aircraft, said Harrington.
   The Hague line divides U.S. and Canadian waters was established
by the World Court in 1984. There have been several reports this
year of American fishing boats crossing the line to the rich
fishing area on the Canadian side.
   Lt. Doug Maybee, a Canadian Forces spokesman, said the Sagueny
began tracking the Concordia after it was spotted fishing in
Canadian waters on five occasions during the weekend.
   The smaller boat allegedly disregarded radio messages before it
``eventually turned toward Sagueny and stuck the right rear quarter
three times,'' Maybee said. No injuries or serious damage were
reported.
   ``Options are being weighed by the political masters in Ottawa
as to what the next step should be,'' he said. ``It is
all-important that a knee-jerk reaction be avoided.''
   The Coast Guard was expected to board the craft when it reached
U.S. waters, Harrington said. ``We will document the vessel's
catch, check charts and records, and varify the identities of the
master and crew,'' she said.
   Harrington said the Concordia will be allowed to proceed to its
home port after the boarding was completed, and any further action
would have to be initiated by the Canadian government.
   Maybee declined to detail what kind of punitive action could be
taken in the alleged ramming about 130 miles off Cape Cod.
   Harrington said the Coast Guard had no plans to intervene,
adding, ``Canadian ships don't usually pursue the American fishing
fleet inside American waters unless they get permission from
diplomatic channels.''
   ``The Coast Guard has been monitoring the situation, abiding its
policy of not interfering with Canadian law enforcement.''

   A chartered jetliner carrying 51 Vietnamese,
their dreams of starting a new life abroad shattered by their
expulsion from Hong Kong, landed in Hanoi early Tuesday.
   They were the first Vietnamese boat people to be repatriated
against their will by Hong Kong. Some screamed for help as they
were taken from camp.
   Government-funded Radio Television Hong Kong reported the Cathay
Pacific Tri-star landed at the Vietnamese capital without incident.
It quoted an unidentified Vietnamese Foreign Ministry official as
saying thousands more Vietnamese living in refugee camps in Hong
Kong will be returned home within weeks.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese who arrived in Hong Kong by boat are
held in squalid camps. Nearly 44,000 are considered illegal
immigrants and are to be sent home unless they can prove
persecution awaits them.
   The Tri-star left this British colony at 5:09 a.m., two hours
after riot police entered a detention center, removed the
Vietnamese and took them to the the airport under tight security
and cover of darkness.
   Put on the plane were eight Vietnamese men, 17 women and 26
children, a government spokeswoman said, insisting on anonymity.
``Repatriation has taken place. Everything went smoothly.''
   In London, the international human rights group Amnesty
International condemned the repatriation and appealed to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and the governor of Hong Kong to halt it.
   The British Foreign Office early Tuesday would said only that
the first involuntary repatriations passed off without difficulty.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is to make a statement on the issue
in the Commons later Tuesday.
   On Monday, visiting U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
repeated U.S. reservations about the repatriations during a meeting
with Mrs. Thatcher at her official 10 Downing St. residence.
   Some Vietnamese shrieked for help from windows of the detention
camp as the operation began at 3 a.m. Others held signs through the
metal bars that said: ``Where is your humanity?''
   Police equipped with helmets, shields, revolvers and batons
quickly pulled them away.
   ``I don't want to go back to Vietnam!'' a woman shouted in
broken Cantonese, the dialect of Hong Kong, waving her hands in
despair.
   A convoy of police vans took the Vietnamese from the Phoenix
House detention center to the airport. Some boat people cried as
they were taken away; others waved at reporters.
   About 175 police and corrections officers were involved,
outnumbering the Vietnamese at least 3-1. Reporters saw no evidence
of violence.
   What appeared to be the same vans later pulled up to the jet on
the airport tarmac, but reporters watching from the roof of a
nearby building could not see people boarding.
   The United States argues that conditions first must improve
inside the Communist country before there is repatriation.
   Britain claims the program is necessary to deter more boat
people from fleeing to overcrowded Hong Kong, about 600 miles
northeast of Hanoi.
   On Monday, Radio Television Hong Kong quoted a Vietnamese
official as saying Hanoi would insist force not be used and would
accept only those who did not resist repatriation.
   According to the radio report, Vietnam agreed more people must
be repatriated than the 636 who returned voluntarily. It quoted the
official as saying those returning would not be punished.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees monitors the boat people
who have returned voluntarily but has refused to take part in the
forced repatriation.
   So far, nearly 6,800 Vietnamese screened by Hong Kong
immigration officials have been rejected as refugees. In 1988, Hong
Kong decided to treat arriving boat people as illegal immigrants as
a means of stopping the mass influx.
   Hong Kong officials said the Vietnamese were arriving much
faster than they could be resettled overseas and most were fleeing
poverty, not persecution.
   Boat people continued to arrive, more than 34,000 from Jan. 1 to
Nov. 10. Officials say it is important to begin the involuntary
repatriation before the next sailing season in the spring.
   Opponents of forced repatriation argued it could trigger
violence in the detention centers and lead some to try suicide.
   The Hong Kong government spokeswoman said that as of early
Tuesday she had received no reports of trouble at the camps.

   A young Moscow actress apparently defected
shortly before her children's theater troupe went home Monday after
performing as part of an exchange program with a local group, a
Minneapolis theater official said.
   Larisa Firsova of the Central Children's Theatre of Moscow
didn't show up Monday morning as 34 members of the 46-member troupe
assembled at their hotel to head for the airport, said Bill Conner,
executive director of the Children's Theater Company of
Minneapolis. ``It was quite a surprise,'' Conner said.
   Conner said FBI officials told him that Firsova, a 24-year-old
apprentice actress, had gone to them in the middle of the night and
that they took her to talk to Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials.
   He said INS officials wouldn't allow anyone to talk to her.
   ``We have no sense of what her status is. They (the FBI) made it
clear they don't know, either,'' said Conner, adding that he could
assume only that Firsova has defected.
   FBI officials did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment, and there was no answer at the local INS office.
   Conner said he had no indication that Firsova, who appeared to
be happy, would defect. The actress has a husband in Moscow, he
said.
   Firsova had one of the chorus roles in ``Dream To Be
Continued,'' which finished its eight-performance run Sunday in St.
Paul.
   The 34 troupe members returned home as planned Monday. The
remaining 11 plan to stay a few more days to work on a play that
the Moscow company's artistic director, Alexei Borodin, plans to
direct in Minneapolis this summer, Conner said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York National Guard's spokesman on
Monday challenged a report that the Guard intentionally counted
no-show troops to get more federal money, and said it is clearing
out its deadwood.
   ``We take sharp exception to this,'' Lt. Col. Peter Kutschera
said following Monday's report in the New York Post. ``To imply
that this is a sham or conscious effort to mislead the Pentagon
isn't borne out by the facts.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo's spokesman, Steve Villano, said, ``The state
inspector general is looking at it and because of this pending
investigation it would be inappropriate for us to comment any
further.'' Villano said other investigations had been conducted.
   The Post said no-show soldiers had been kept on the Guard's
rosters for at least six years, giving the Pentagon the false
impression that the Guard is ready for war or national disaster.
   Kutschera said he was particularly disturbed by the assertion
that the Guard was not prepared for war, and said a ``vast number''
had been judged to be combat-ready.
   Asked how many units were combat-ready, he replied, ``That's
very close to being classified information.''
   The Post said the New York Guard's budget has tripled to $390
million a year since 1975 despite having the second worst
attendance record in the nation.
   The newspaper said it determined that Vito Castellano, Guard
commander from 1975 to 1986, created a phantom force in 1984.
   Castellano, who reportedly retired under pressure, was released
from prison in July after serving a year for taking bribes and
using his position to lobby for Wedtech, a defunct defense
contractor.
   The Post said a high-ranking Guard official who asked not to be
further identified said he followed Castellano's orders to list
2,500 phantom soldiers on the roster.
   The Post, citing a confidential draft report prepared for
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, also said Castellano
admitted to prosecutors two years ago that he put phantom soldiers
on the Guard's roster.
   There was no answer at a suburban telephone listed under
Castellano's name. His former attorney, Edwin Silberling, no longer
practices law and did not know how to reach Castellano.
   The Post said 1,600 to 4,000 no-show New York Guard soldiers
remain absent without leave and should be dismissed.
   No-shows are not paid, but the Post said the Pentagon provides
funds for their equipment and training.
   Kutscher said that was not true. ``Federal money for equipment
allocated to the National Guard is not based on drill attendance
but on the authorized level of equipment in the organization
itself,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Monday the
United Nations should repeal its ``odious'' 1975 resolution that
equates Zionism with racism in an effort to promote the Middle East
peace process.
   He also gave Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar a check
for $65 million in partial payment of major U.S. arrears, an issue
that has stirred anti-U.S. sentiment here. U.N. officials said the
United States now owes $365 million for the regular budget and $153
million for peacekeeping.
   ``Repealing this resolution would re-establish the stature and
moral authority of the U.N.,'' Quayle told reporters after a
50-minute meeting with the U.N. chief.
   ``Now is the time to begin discussion on substituting or getting
rid of this odious resolution which equates Zionism with racism.''
   Quayle's comments came in answer to questions.
   The resolution is symbolic and not binding, but has been a sore
point with the United States and its ally, Israel. U.S. and Israeli
diplomats said that killing the resolution, or declaring it null
and void, could enhance the Middle East peace process by removing
an Israeli objection to U.N. involvement.
   The General Assembly resolution was backed by Israel's Arab
rivals, the Soviet Union and much of the movement professing
non-alignment with either superpower. Quayle said it ``should be
declared null and void.''
   Francois Giuliani, spokesman for the secretary-general, later
said the U.N. chief had no comment. ``It is up to the member states
and General Assembly to decide,'' he told reporters at a daily
briefing.
   He said no resolution has ever been rescinded or repealed, but
that the 159-nation General Assembly ``can innovate if it wishes to
do so.''
   Resolutions are part of the permanent record and cannot be
repealed or erased, U.N. diplomats said. However, substitute
resolutions can be presented and previous resolutions, by a
majority vote, can be declared void and no longer representative of
the majority's sentiments.
   Quayle said the Soviet Union and other countries ``can be very
helpful'' in the matter of repeal. The Soviet Union changed its
traditional vote this year and for the first time supported
accepting Israel's credentials in the General Assembly.
   Quayle was asked how repeal would promote Palestinian rights. He
said that renouncing the resolution would help human rights in the
occupied territories and send a positive signal about the Middle
East peace process.
   Quayle told reporters he had ``a very good and candid
discussion'' with the U.N. chief on a number of issues, including
the U.S.-Soviet summit in Malta, allegations of Cuban violations of
human rights, forthcoming Nicaraguan elections and the Central
American peace process.
   He said he briefed Perez de Cuellar on the Malta meeting. He
said he told him ``Cuba is becoming more isolated.'' He said Cuban
President Fidel Castro's criticism of perestroika, or reform, in
the Soviet Union ``is an indirect criticism of Soviet President
(Mikhail) Gorbachev.''
   The United States last week suffered a setback on Middle East
issues after it threatened to cut off all funding to the United
Nations if the world body upgraded the status of the Palestine
Liberation Organization as an observer state, instead of an
observer group.
   The issue was defused and the question was put off, but
anti-U.S. sentiment remains. The General Assembly later adopted a
package of pro-PLO, anti-Israel resolutions _ an annual event.

   The Bush administration says its surprise move
to rekindle ties with China's hard-line rulers comes because
further isolation of China could compound the tragedy of Tiananmen
Square.
   But Democrats in Congress questioned the weekend mission to
Beijing by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, saying China has not let
up the repression that began with the June 3 massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   President Bush had no comment Sunday on why he dispatched
Scowcroft to Beijing, except to say as he left church, ``We'll have
more to say about that later.''
   Scowcroft and Eagleburger were due back in Washington later
today.

   An opposition campaign rally turned
into a riot in which one person was reported killed and more than
20 people injured. Foreign observers blamed the violence on
Sandinista provocateurs.
   Sunday's violence lasted four hours and was the worst of the
campaign leading to general elections set for Feb. 25, and the
foreigners said it raised doubts that the balloting would be held
without incident.
   Opponents and supporters of the ruling Sandinistas clashed with
machetes, knives, broken bottles, rocks and sticks Sunday in this
town 30 miles south of Managua. The local Sandinista Front
headquarters was sacked, and two vehicles were burned.
   ``I came here assuming that there would be free and open
elections,'' said Robert Beckel of the Washington-based Center for
Democracy, a bipartisan group invited to observe the electoral
process. ``You can't witness what we saw today and believe there's
any way there'll be a fair election in this country.''

   The Bush administration plans to propose that
generic drug companies pay ``user fees'' to help beef up government
regulation of an industry reeling from a bribery and fraud scandal,
sources say.
   The plan drafted by the Food and Drug Administration would
impose registration fees on generic drug makers and charge them
another fee for each application they file, said a source who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   The fees would raise about $18 million as part of a $144 million
package of FDA fees the administration plans to propose in its
fiscal 1991 budget, the source said.
   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration, favors
user fees because they raise money without raising taxes. Plans to
extend these fees to the drug industry have been proposed before,
only to be axed by opponents on Capitol Hill.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, facing domestic challenges
to one-party Communist rule as he watches Communists tumble from
power in the East bloc, says the Soviet leadership could itself be
ousted if reform continues to lag.
   The Soviet president's comments to a closed meeting of the
party's governing Central Committee were published Sunday, as
Estonians and Latvians voted in local elections in which Communists
were expected to lose heavily.
   Human rights activists called for a two-hour national strike
today to demand that legislators consider changing a constitutional
provision that guarantees Communists a ``leading and guiding role''
in society.
   Activist Andrei Sakharov, who was trying to organize the strike,
said Sunday that he could not predict how much support it would

   A troubled musical that never made it to Broadway
is getting a second chance in London, counting on the Midas touch
of director Trevor Nunn.
   Nunn has made international hits out of ``Cats,'' ``Starlight
Express'' and ``Les Miserables.'' Now he has turned his attention
to ``The Baker's Wife,'' an American show which closed on the road
over a decade ago and has yet to be seen on Broadway.
   ``I really do think it can give pleasure; I know that it can
work,'' said Nunn during rehearsals before the show opened Nov. 27
to mixed reviews.
   Based on Marcel Pagnol's 1938 French film ``La Femme du
Boulanger,'' with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz (``Pippin,''
``Godspell'') and a book by Joseph Stein (``Fiddler on the Roof''),
the musical is playing at the Phoenix Theater.
   Sharon Lee Hill, who is married to Nunn, plays the eponymous
baker's wife, an adulterous young bride in 1930s Provence, in
southern France.
   Alun Armstrong, the original innkeeper Thenardier in ``Les
Miserables,'' is the cuckolded French baker, and Drue Williams
plays the proverbial other man.
   The original production, starring Topol in his American stage
debut, opened in Los Angeles in the summer of 1976. By the time it
closed in November at The Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in
Washington, it had been through so many rewrites, directors and
cast changes that its creators forbade the show to move to Broadway.
   It was meant to open at the Martin Beck Theater the week of Nov.
15 as then-producer David Merrick's 90th Broadway show.
   ``By that time, we felt the show was not ours any longer,''
recalled Stein. ``Traumatic is a little too strong a word; it was a
painful experience.
   ``The show we are now opening is very much the show we had hoped
to have originally.'' The 77-year-old Stein added that it has
affinities to his two biggest hits, ``Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964)
and ``Zorba'' (1968).
   ``It's about how an experience of some people in a village
changes the community,'' said Stein, whose last Broadway show was
the ill-fated 1986 ``Rags,'' with Teresa Stratas.
   ``It's like `Fiddler' and `Zorba' in that this is a community of
very simple, rather rudimentary people with elementary passions
both comedic and serious.''
   Nunn said both Stein and Schwartz had to be talked into
reapproaching their show: ``It was a wound they didn't necessarily
want to reopen, and therefore being true to the material has been
the most important task.
   ``I felt if ever Stephen and Joe thought again that those people
presenting the show were being random, were being panicked, were
concerned with results rather than intentions, then their hearts
would be broken.''
   His company, Homevale Ltd., has an undisclosed investment in the
production, as does Broadway producer James M. Nederlander.
   Nunn first encountered the music from ``The Baker's Wife'' at
Broadway auditions for ``Cats'' in 1982. He heard it again three
years later at New York auditions for ``Starlight Express'' and
``Les Miserables.''
   The show was recorded privately following its pre-Broadway run,
with Paul Sorvino and Patti LuPone singing the main roles. Its
best-known number, the lilting ``Meadowlark,'' is featured on Sarah
Brightman's new album ``The Songs That Got Away.''
   Nunn acknowledged ``The Baker's Wife'' marks a change from his
past spectaculars. ``It's a traditional Broadway book musical. .. .
I myself hugely enjoy that moment where music enters, and there's a
frisson, a wonderful tingle.''
   The director has staged two other London shows this year: Andrew
Lloyd Webber's musical ``Aspects of Love,'' and Shakespeare's
``Othello,'' with Ian McKellen and Willard White.
   ``Aspects of Love'' is scheduled to open April 3 on Broadway,
but Nunn feels it's too early to say whether ``The Baker's Wife''
will follow suit.
   ``The show has a wonderful community feel,'' he said, ``but
that's not at all the same as the considerations that come in to
doing something on Broadway where everyone says, `Yeah, but is it
new? Is it revolutionary? Is it the talk of the town?'''

<HEAD>First Major Show of Black and Asian Art in London Gallery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rasheed Araeen was shocked to find nearly 1,400
years of Islamic civilization reduced to two pages in ``The Story
of Art,'' a standard English textbook.
   So the Pakistan-born sculptor organized the first exhibition of
exclusively black and Asian immigrant art ever to be shown at a
major London gallery.
   Called ``The Other Story: Afro-Asian Artists in Post-War
Britain,'' the exhibition opened Nov. 30 at the Hayward Gallery,
featuring the work of 24 artists from China, Guyana, India,
Jamaica, Japan, Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South
Africa, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. Three are the British-born children
of immigrants.
   Araeen, 54, came to Britain from Pakistan in 1964 as a civil
engineer and became a full-time sculptor four years later. He won
his first prize in 1969. He sees the show at the Hayward Gallery,
which runs through Feb. 4, as a triumph.
   ``It was a hard struggle to put it on. I have been trying for 11
years,'' he said in an interview.
   In 1978, he first took the idea to the Arts Council, which
distributes government subsidies for the arts and helps fund the
Hayward Gallery. They said the time wasn't right.
   ``I kept pestering them,'' Araeen said. ``I went back in 1982
and they still said no. Two years later my autobiography, `Making
Myself Visible,' was published, and in 1987 I started bringing out
a journal of our art called Third Text. I think all that helped, as
well as getting work into exhibitions in Britain and abroad.
   ``It takes time to understand _ perhaps they needed the time.
Government policy has changed.''
   The show is vivid and colorful, but some themes, such as racism,
usually arent't shown in exhibits that make it to the mainstream
London galleries.
   Some exhibits are funny. Li Yuan from China in his participation
art, invites visitors to remove magnets from revolving metal plates
and reposition them. Iqbal Geoffrey from Pakistan lines up 11 rat
traps which have ``caught'' torn-up pieces of reproductions of
paintings and calls the work ``In Search of an Ideal Landscape.''
   The most striking exhibit is a 5-foot-tall elmwood carving of a
male head and torso by the late Ronald Moody, a Jamaican who used
the wood's natural whorls to emphasize the parts of the face and
body.
   Araeen insists the immigrants' work is not inherently different
from European art.
   ``It was our inspiration to be part of something global. We
don't want separation of cultures,'' he said.
   The catalog prints the first-ever chronology of immigrant art in
Britain, starting from 1941 and interspersed with incidents of
racism. It accuses British dealers and exhibition organizers of
neglecting non-British artists.
   However, Brian Sewell, the toughest of London art critics, wrote
in the Sunday Times that the immigrant artists' work is largely
ignored by critics and dealers because it is ``not good enough.''
   Sewell felt the artists are influenced by Western imagery, and
if they wish ``to be seen as a match for the English whites whom
Araeen derides as privileged, then he should relish the competition
and comparison inevitable in a mixed exhibition.''
   Says Araeen: ``There are 14 million non-Europeans in Europe now,
compared to not even 1 million before World War II. Decolonization
has led to India, for example, producing high-caliber scientists,
doctors and engineers in the United States and Europe, so why not
artists? They, too, look for places to fulfill their ambitions and
develop their ideas. It's not easy to do that in poverty.
   ``Racism exists _ it functions at all levels. If there is
discrimination in jobs there is in art as well.''
   Andrew Dempsey, deputy director of the Hayward said the work
belongs to British contemporary art and is part of the history of
art in England.
   Prices of the works on show run from $150 to $47,000.

   Although ``Christmas in America: A Love
Story'' reflects parts of Kenny Rogers' own life it was written
before he was signed to star in the NBC special.
   The one-hour show on Wednesday tells the story of an
internationally famous photographer who reflects on his life and
uses the opportunity to heal the wounds between himself and his
son. The son felt his father had always put his career ahead of his
family.
   Rogers, although best known as a singer and actor, is also an
acclaimed photographer and recently patched up relations with his
own son, Kenny Rogers Jr., who co-stars in the special as the son.
Kate Reid and Ashley Crow are also in the show.
   ``We sent him the script to read,'' said Earl Hamner, who
co-wrote the show with Donald Sipes. ``I was delighted when I
learned he was not only a photographer but a good photographer.
Kenny felt he had neglected his own son and had an estrangement.''
   Sipes said, ``I think the feeling of the film is one of healing
and coming together, which was reflected in Kenny's own
relationship with his son.''
   When the project got under way Hamner and Sipes were asked to
come up with a story about four periods in a man's life.
   ``Don and I came up with the idea of making him a
photographer,'' said Hamner. ``That way we could use photos to
introduce each period. The first period is childhood, when he
becomes interested in photography. The next is young manhood, when
he goes off to war and falls in love. Act three is his marriage and
family and the development of his career and the conflicts it
causes in his personal life.
   ``The last act is about maturity and reconciliation. It's about
regeneration, which is so appropriate for this time of year. An
area Don and I wanted to explore is something that is common to all
of us in this society. That's the work ethic and how it can cause a
man to neglect his family.''
   Hamner said he also felt at ease with Rogers when he learned
that he's a fisherman. Hamner fished the streams of his native
Virginia for many years before discovering salmon fishing.
   ``I fish in British Columbia now,'' he said. ``I caught a
50-pound fish up there last year. That's a lifetime fish. They
canned it for me and the cans arrived just yesterday.''
   This is the first collaboration between Hamner, best known for
creating ``The Waltons'' and ``Falcon Crest,'' and Sipes, a former
entertainment executive and a published novelist.
   ``We've known each other a long time,'' said Sipes. ``We always
discussed writing because we both write. We both collect books and
when we meet for lunch we arrange it near a book store. After lunch
we'll go and browse for a while. I collect literature and Earl
collects Americana.''
   Hamner said, ``My dream is to find a rare book and buy it for
$7.50. But the book store people all know the value of these
books.''
   Their next collaboration will be ``Brewster Place,'' a half-hour
drama for ABC starring Oprah Winfrey. It will be filmed in Chicago,
where her talk show is based, and will make its debut in April.
They are also working on several cable television projects and
wrote a pilot last year for NBC.
   ``Brewster Place'' is adapted from the book ``The Women of
Brewster Place'' and the miniseries that ran on ABC. Hamner and
Sipes are making some changes in the concept because the miniseries
presented such a negative image of black men.
   ``We'll have much more positive images,'' said Sipes. ``We're
adding some new characters. Oprah will play her character in her
late 40s. She'll have to be aged and padded for the part.''
   Hamner said he feels the television audience wants the kind of
family programming represented by ``Christmas in America.''
   ``The networks want people between 18 and 49,'' he said. ``You
cut out a lot of people that way. Suppose you do a `once upon a
time' story. You can attract the 18-49 audience and everyone else,
too.''

<HEAD>Canadian Socialists Select First Female Party Leader in Canada</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The socialist New Democrats have become the first
of Canada's three national political parties to choose a female
leader, hoping some new vitality can produce a long-sought
breakthrough to high office.
   Audrey McLaughlin, who chose American singer Tracy Chapman's
``Talking 'bout a Revolution'' as her theme song at the party's
convention this month, was elected leader on the fourth ballot.
   ``I stand for change,'' she said. ``I want to change Canada. ..
. Let's seize the future and not the past.''
   The 53-year-old latecomer to federal politics from the sparsely
populated Yukon succeeds Ed Broadbent, who retired after 14 years
as leader of the New Democratic Party.
   His credibility and personal popularity had brought hopes for
significant gains before the November 1988 national election, but
the hopes failed to materialize.
   Even so, a Gallup poll taken two months before the convention in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, found that 47 percent of Canadians believed the
New Democrats would be hurt by losing Broadbent as leader. Twenty
percent said his departure would help the party and 15 percent said
it would have no effect.
   Broadbent delivered a farewell speech that listed policies he
said would be in keeping with the party's social democratic
tradition.
   Among them were an end to child poverty, a softening of what he
called the market economy's harsh impact, a diversion of military
spending to aid for the Third World and a tougher approach to
environmental protection that would include jail sentences for
polluters.
   The way was clear for a newcomer after some of the party's best
known figures declined to run for the leadership post. McLaughlin
was the only woman among seven hopefuls.
   She has provided few specifics of what direction she will take
as party leader, speaking simply of a new vision and new approach
to the political process. She has blamed Canada's free trade
agreement with the United States for most of Canada's current
problems and said the party will oppose it again in the next
national election, which is some three years away.
   The trade pact, opposed by the Liberal Party as well as the New
Democrats, took effect last Jan. 1 after the hard-fought election
returned Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
Party for a second consecutive majority government.
   The Conservatives won 43 percent of the popular vote, the
Liberals 32 percent and the New Democrats 20 percent, enough for a
record 43 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons.
   But the popular vote level for the party, known as the NDP,
didn't increase from past performances.
   The New Democrats' strength has been in Western Canada, and the
party failed to make a much heralded national breakthrough into
French-speaking Quebec and remained of limited appeal in Canada's
Atlantic coastal provinces.
   McLaughlin was born and grew up near Windsor, Ontario. She
separated from her husband in the early part of the 1970s and her
two children were old enough to be on their own by 1979.
   In what is becoming a much told story in Canada, she bought a
truck that year and headed north to settle in the Yukon.
   Her earlier career had been in social work, and she worked in
Whitehorse, the Yukon's capital, as a consultant on social policy
development. She also worked as an NDP organizer and policy adviser.
   She became nationally known after winning a 1987 race for the
Yukon's one seat in the House of Commons, a seat that had been held
by a Progressive Conservative for the previous 30 years.
   Although some skepticism has been heard in Canada about whether
the present moment in world history is a time for revitalizing a
social democratic party, Mulroney's declining popularity in opinion
polls indicates plenty of room for opposing viewpoints.
   A Gallup poll released Nov. 23 found that 26 percent of
Canadians would vote for the Progressive Conservatives if an
election were held now, 25 percent for the New Democrats and 42
percent for the Liberals.
   Liberal leader John Turner, whose opposition to the free trade
pact helped revitalize his party, is stepping down and a successor
will be chosen in June.
   McLaughlin studied French as part of her preparations for the
NDP leadership race and used her speaking appearances at the
convention to show an acceptable accent if limited fluency. Her
comments were considered an attempt to show that the party remains
seriously interested in Quebec.

<HEAD>Britain's Moslems Split over Response to `The Satanic Verses'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Moslem leaders in Britain agree Salman Rushdie
blasphemed their religion in his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' but
they differ sharply on what to do about it.
   One noted Moslem figure, Hesham El-Essawy, said he wanted to go
to Iran and win a reprieve for the author, but after a Tehran
newspaper said ``the hanging rope'' awaited him, he stayed in
England.
   A prominent Moslem, Kalim Siddiqui, supports the death sentence
imposed on Rushdie by the late Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, and thinks Rushdie should be hounded perpetually until
his book, published 14 months ago, is withdrawn from bookshelves.
   Rushdie, a Bombay-born Moslem, has been in hiding under police
guard since Feb. 14. Khomeini died in Iran on June 3, but his edict
endures.
   Siddiqui, director of the Moslem Institute, says Khomeini's
edict is unchallengeable and that Rushdie got ``nothing less than
he thoroughly deserved.''
   But while favoring the death decree ``absolutely,'' he says it
is ``not for Moslems living in this country to break British law to
bring Rushdie to book.''
   El-Essawy, chairman of the Islamic Society for the Promotion of
Religious Tolerance, contends that the death sentence contradicts
the Koran's teachings.
   ``As a Moslem, I should really suppress the human response and
adopt the religious response, which is, `Don't punish him; leave
him to God to punish or forgive him as He wishes,''' El-Essawy said
in an interview.
   He planned a lecture tour of Iran, Egypt and the Persian Gulf
states in February to dispute Khomeini's edict but canceled it when
Iran declined to guarantee his safety and its semi-official
newspaper, Kehan, warned he would be hanged.
   ``The death sentence is really a slur, is something that defames
the religion of Islam,'' El-Essawy maintained.
   ``As long as the man stays in hiding, we'll stand accused of
putting him there and keeping him there. We'll be regarded as
potential killers.''
   El-Essawy said he hoped at least to remove the $5.2-million
bounty offered by Iranian clerics for Rushdie's assassination, by
designating it ``the tactics of gangsters and not worthy of the
Islamic republic.''
   El-Essawy and Siddiqui have never met. El-Essawy's group seeks
to identify and correct causes of intolerance toward Moslems.
Siddiqui's disseminates information on Moslem political thought.
   Siddiqui, came to Britain from Pakistan in 1954; El-Essawy came
from Egypt in 1970. Both are married with three children and both
are thoroughly Westernized in appearance. They share an easy humor
and a mutual contempt.
   In a book-lined study at his house in suburban London, Siddiqui,
58, dismissed El-Essawy as an apologist.
   ``Totally idiotic the man is, to put it mildly,'' he said.
   El-Essawy, 43, seated in his ornamented dentist's office in
Harley St., London's medical row, said Siddiqui's speeches verge on
``incitement to murder, but don't let me be the judge.''
   In October, at a Moslem rally in northern England, Siddiqui
called for a show of hands on whether the death sentence was just
and virtually all 250 people in the audience were reported to have
raised their hands. A BBC-TV poll published the previous night
indicated only 35 percent of Britain's 2 million Moslems were in
favor of the death penalty.
   Police are investigating whether Siddiqui was guilty of
incitement and have obtained a court order forcing the BBC to hand
over its footage of the rally.
   Siddiqui complains the British media portray him ``as a sort of
rabble rouser _ the opposite to Salman Rushdie, as it were.''
   He says Moslems have no choice but to protest and show that
``anyone who tries to go down the same road as Mr. Rushdie in the
future will be dealt with much more severely.''
   Siddiqui wants Rushdie and his publishers, Viking Penguin, to
withdraw the book and that profits from the 1.2 million copies sold
should be shared among relatives of 26 people who died in
anti-Rushdie riots in India and Pakistan.
   ``They should make amends, and then we'll call it a day,''
Siddiqui said. Otherwise, ``this is going to be an issue in 50
years from now.''
   El-Essawy said: ``There is not one single Moslem who is not
angered by the book.'' But he thinks Rushdie might defuse the furor
by affixing labels to his book making clear the contents are
fictional.
   He said he met Rushdie on a train two weeks before the author
was driven into hiding and suggested the disclaimer label, but
Rushdie rejected it as tantamount to ``an apology.''
   Rushdie is ``not showing any good will at all,'' El-Essawy
added. ``In fact, he's doing the opposite _ he's trying to promote
the campaign against him ... because he wants to sell more books.''
   Rushdie, 42, continues to write, and occasionally aims barbed
comments at his opponents.
   In a book review he wrote recently for The Times Literary
Supplement, he alluded to the public burning of his book by Moslems
with this thought: ``To burn a book is not to destroy it. One
minute of darkness will not make us blind.''

<HEAD>State-run Schools Still Off-limits to South African Reforms</HEAD>

   While the government pursues
racial reform on several other fronts, rigid apartheid remains the
rule at state-run schools, despite a growing clamor for change.
   For millions of black children, schools are overcrowded or
unavailable. Scores of white schools have closed because of pupil
shortages. Yet the government recently rebuffed a coalition of
white parents, teachers and students who petitioned to establish
South Africa's first multiracial public school.
   ``Amid all his encouraging moves ... President de Klerk has just
failed an acid test,'' said The Star, the country's largest daily
newspaper. ``No matter how compelling the reasons to amend that
archaic policy, no matter how desperate the pleas from those
affected, apartheid remains alive and kicking in the school
system.''
   Since taking office in mid-August, President F.W. de Klerk
repeatedly has vowed to eliminate racial discrimination. Yet his
support for segregated state schools is unwavering despite official
figures indicating that the government spends nearly five times as
much to educate a white pupil as a black one.
   According to the minister in charge of white education, Piet
Clase, school segregation is essential to ensure ``cultural and
linguistic continuity'' between the home and the classroom.''
   The ``acid test'' referred to by The Star was the fate of
Johannesburg Girls High School, a 102-year-old institution the
government targeted for closure because of declining enrollment.
   A substantial majority of the teachers, students and parents
launched an unprecedented campaign to save the whites-only school
by opening it to children of the thousands of black, mixed-race and
Indian families who have moved into the inner-city neighborhood in
defiance of residential segregation laws.
   After hinting that it might allow a experimental multiracial
public school, the government decided instead on a compromise. It
would allow the high school to remain in operation, but only as a
private school.
   The state will provide a subsidy of up to 45 percent of its
operating costs, but even so, few of the current pupils are
expected to able to afford the projected monthly fees of 100 rand
($38).
   The school also is expected to lose two of its five grades
because of financial constraints and will be able to cater to no
more than 240 pupils, although the facility has a capacity of
nearly 700.
   ``The creation of a private school is no victory as far as I am
concerned,'' said Neil McGurk, a member of a provisional board of
trustees for the new school. ``The new school will have nothing to
do with the old.''
   McGurk, the principal of a multiracial Roman Catholic school,
said the government tends to lower its subsidies to private schools
with relatively high proportions of black pupils.
   ``The state has a natural temptation to mobilize as much
resources as possible for whites,'' he said.
   The government currently spends the equivalent of about $800 a
year to educate a white child, compared to less than $200 per black
child. This gap has been reduced from previous years, but the
government recently abandoned a 10-year plan to equalize the
per-capita education spending.
   In Soweto, the largest black township with an estimated 2.5
million residents, schools have been plagued by violence, severe
overcrowding, shortages of textbooks, poor performances on exams
and deteriorating facilities.
   In many Soweto schools, there are 40 to 50 pupils for each
teacher.
   The South African Institute of Race Relations reported in
November that 196 white schools have been closed in the past 10
years, and that remaining white schools have more than 250,000
vacant places. An estimated 1 million black children have no
schools to go to, the institute said.
   A handful of the closed-down white schools have been made
available to the education departments for Indians and mixed-race
people, but most have been leased to other government agencies and
42 are unused, said the institute, an independent research
organization.
   ``Given the crying need for school places for black pupils, this
is a criminal waste of a high order,'' said a recent editorial in
The Star.
   The campaign to integrate Johannesburg Girls High School has
been emulated in other cities, under the banner of a group called
All Schools for All People.
   Ahmed Moonda, a leader of the group, said that if the state does
not act, a defiance campaign will be launched next year in which
parents will take their children to the nearest school and demand
enrollment.
   ``We do not want to cause disruptions, but we may be forced
to,'' he said. ``The state is simply fostering illiteracy among our
kids.''

<HEAD>Politicians Plot Greater Safety in Numbers on Risky Votes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a political system that is supposed to
thrive on competition, there's something odd happening. Politicians
are starting to suggest the only way to deal with really tough
issues is under a cease-fire, a truce in which they would agree to
put unpopular votes out of campaign bounds.
   One Republican leader called it a ``suicide pact,'' and said
that may be what it takes to get action to rein some politically
sacrosanct spending programs _ Social Security and veterans
benefits were two he mentioned.
   The political parties already have put one such deal into
effect, agreeing that Republicans and Democrats will speak no
campaign evil of each other for supporting the two-step pay raise
the House voted itself just before adjourning.
   House leaders of both parties insisted on that pledge before the
vote on salaries and a 1991 ban on honoraria, finding at last a way
around the political perils that have gone with raises in
congressional pay for 200 years.
   So the chairmen of the national and congressional campaign
committees agreed the pay vote ``is not an appropriate point of
criticism in the coming campaigns.'' That will be fine with House
memers who voted for the raise; dissenters and challengers who try
to make it an issue will risk losing the financial and technical
support they could otherwise expect from the national campaign
committees.
   With that deal cut, other topics may start to look inviting as
prospects for non-aggression pacts.
   That idea and some variations on the theme came up last week at
a forum on Congress in the 1990s, sponsored by the American
Enterprise Institute.
   In theory, the American political system and Congress itself
should work best with ideas, issues, candidates and officeholders
competing in contests that produce winners, force compromise and
ultimately shape consensus.
   Former President Gerald Ford argued that side of the case at the
AEI forum, saying it can work between the branches as well as
between the parties. ``A little conflict can bring out the best,''
said Ford, a former House Republican leader who went to the White
House and vetoed bills at a record pace, 67 of them in 2{ years.
``I'm not sure that confrontation between the White House and the
Congress is necessarily bad.''
   As for political competition, Ford said if he had the power to
draw congressional district lines, each of them would be as closely
divided as possible, with party registration split no more widely
than 60 percent to 40 percent for the minority.
   But Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic
conference, said congressmen from closely divided districts are the
most skittish on controversial votes. He said members with
politically safe districts may be in better shape to make the
correct but unpopular decisions that sometimes come to a member of
Congress.
   Tony Coelho, the former Democratic whip who quit the House
earlier this year, said professional, aggressive congressional
campaign committees in both parties tend to make members nervous
about becoming a target over a potentially unpopular vote.
   ``It's very organized, very controlled,'' Coelho said. ``I was
part of it, I recognize it.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate Republican whip, said
that's why members of Congress back away from such risky positions
as limiting Social Security benefit increases in order to chip away
at the federal deficit. Republicans tried in 1982 and got creamed,
he said.
   ``Who the hell is going to do the heavy lifting?'' he said.
   All sides acknowledge it will take unpopular votes to make real
reductions in the federal deficit.
   ``Nobody gets elected saying no,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
``You get elected saying yes.''
   It was Simpson who suggested that a political truce might be a
way to get things done, by taking the sting and risk out of votes
to cut votes to cut popular spending programs. ``We ought to sit
down and do the suicide pact,'' he said, agreeing members in both
parties will ``go over the cliff together'' and won't try to punish
each other later.
   ``It doesn't take courage if we all do it,'' he said.

   Today's highlight in history:
   On December 22, 1944, during the World War II Battle of the
Bulge, the Germans demanded the surrender of encircled American
troops at Bastogne, Belgium. Brigadier Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe
reportedly replied: ``Nuts!'' The Americans held out until
additional U.S. forces ended the siege four days later.
   On this date:
   In 1775, a Continental naval fleet was organized in the
rebellious American colonies under the command of Ezek Hopkins.

<HEAD>Airport on Island Not Seen as Solution to Travelers' Woes in Japan</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>

   While foreign businessmen complain of
obstacles to Japanese markets, travelers complain that crowded
airports are the most frustrating barriers to getting into the
country.
   In hopes of easing the bottleneck for air travelers, the
Japanese are building an island in Osaka Bay and plan to put an
airport on it. But few industry insiders think it will be the
answer.
   The project is moving smoothly along, nevertheless, in contrast
to Tokyo's Narita airport, where riot police recently battled
radicals who used firebombs to defend land on which a runway was to
have been completed 15 years ago.
   At Narita, eight farmers still grow vegetables on and around the
planned second runway, refusing to sell their land. Though police
have begun to dismantle buildings erected by radicals supporting
the farmers, industry sources are doubtful the second runway will
be completed by the end its new deadline, two years from now.
   For more than 20 years, protests against Narita have left six
people dead. The airport is surrounded by barbed wire and riot
police. It is not connected to key rail lines to Tokyo, 40 miles
away.
   The $7 billion Kansai Airport at Osaka, however, will be out in
the bay and not likely to generate any fights with the city's
residents.
   The airport is one of the world's biggest civil engineering
projects of the 1990s, but it has its critics.
   Japan is famous for its bullet trains and sparkling subways, but
its links to the outside world _ international airports _ are
widely considered unworthy of a great economic power.
   The main link, Tokyo's Narita airport, ``is becoming a symbol of
Japan's closed nature,'' says Yasuo Sakakibara, an economics
professor.
   New Tokyo International Airport, as Narita is officially called,
greets passengers after long trans-Pacific flights with crowds and
confusion. After picking up their luggage, passengers get a choice
between a $200, 40-mile taxi ride to Tokyo or a wait of an hour or
more for a bus.
   Narita handled 4 million more passengers last year than it was
planned for, all squeezing through the same number of immigration
counters as when the airport opened in 1978.
   With just one runway, Narita handles 17 million passengers a
year. New York's John F. Kennedy airport, with five runways,
handles 10 million.
   ``The congestion is terrible,'' says Richard Jurek, director of
Pacific operations for Northwest Airlines. ``The day (Narita)
opened it had already reached its comfortable capacity.''
   The new Kansai airport, an hour's flight west of Tokyo, is
supposed to relieve the problem when it opens in 1993.
   But industry sources say the runway is too short, the distance
to Osaka too far, and its link highways too narrow. An airport
serving a metropolitan region that produces 2 percent of the
world's economic output needs at least three runways, they say, not
just one. Three were originally planned, and the Ministry of
Transport is still hoping for them, but the Ministry of Finance
says the country can afford only one.
   Industry sources predict Kansai airport will be full within a
year or two of its opening. They expect growth in Japan's
international passengers in the next few years to nearly match the
more than 20 percent annual growth since 1987.
   Today, boats cruise in Osaka Bay where 747s will take off.
Machines disgorge enough sand to fill scores of Houston Astrodomes
into a box 2.7 miles long that will be the airport's supposedly
earthquake-proof base. It is one of the deepest of man-made
islands, standing in 60 feet of water.
   On it will rise an ultra-modern terminal with people movers and
indoor landscaping. A two-level bridge will carry trains and cars
across 2.3 miles of water to Osaka's shore.
   Japan squeezes 122 million people _ half the population of the
United States _ into a habitable area about the size of
Pennsylvania; few of them want an airport in their backyard. That
keeps airports small and inconvenient to city centers. The island
airport will be an hour's bus ride from downtown Osaka.
   The sand used for the island is costing more than it should
because of price-fixing among contractors, who were stiffly fined
by Japan's antitrust agency. The United States has charged that
collusive business practices like the sand cartel keep out foreign
businesses; Washington has made access to the airport's
construction by U.S. companies a major trade issue with the
Japanese.
   After long negotiations, the airport opened bidding on
construction and supplies to foreign firms, and an Italian
architect won a design contest for the terminal building.
   Despite the prospect of problems ahead, foreign airlines are
lining up for flight slots at the new airport. For many airlines,
the Pacific and Japan are the fastest growing and most profitable
markets in the world.

<HEAD>UNDATED: super cruisers.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One of the groups, composed of the cruiser Exeter with 8-inch
guns and the cruisers Ajax and Achilles with 6-inchers, found the
Graf Spee in the South Atlantic near Montevideo, Uruguay, where the
River Plate vents to the sea. Each of the hunter groups was
configured to deal with a pocket battleship, but this group lacked
another 8-inch cruiser, the Cumberland, which was refitting in the
Falklands.
   The Graf Spee had 11-inch guns with greater range and hitting
power than the British ships. Even with the Exeter steaming toward
her, the Spee had three minutes of unimpeded barrages before she
came into Exeter's range. The lighter cruisers were under even a
greater disadvantage.
   The Spee sought to stay at maximum range under the cover of
smoke, but it soon found itself beset from three directions. The
Exeter was hit and out of control when the light cruisers finally
came into play.
   The Graf Spee made for the River Plate under cover of smoke. The
Exeter, her bridge and forward guns gone, was being steered from
the emergency controls aft. The Ajax had lost its after turrets.
The entire engagement had taken an hour and 20 minutes. The British
ships pursued the Spee to Montevideo and lay to outside. They were
joined by the Cumberland two days after the initial action, evening
the odds.
   Capt. Langsdorff of the Graf Spee notified the German admiralty
of his plight and asked instructions. On the evening of Dec. 17, he
headed his ship out of the harbor and toward the waiting British
ships. Some two hours later she blew herself up. Two days later
Langsdorff shot himself.
   Churchill wrote: ``The effects of the action off the Plate gave
intense joy to the British nation and enhanced our prestige
throughout the world. The spectacle of the three smaller British
ships unhesitatingly attacking and putting to flight their far more
heavily gunned and armoured antagonist was everywhere admired.''
   Not everywhere. The Soviet naval publication, Red Fleet, called
it a demonstration of the impotence of the British.
   Meanwhile, the Soviets invaded Finland 25 days before Christmas,
but the Finns would not lie down and play dead. American moviegoers
that Christmas would see white-clad Finnish ski troops on their
newsreels.
   In London, Churchill pleaded for a softening of the blackout
regulations, which he saw as hurting the war effort and morale of
the populace.
   Military objectives, he said, could best be attacked by daylight
or moonlight. London could be found easily by simple directional
navigation. He suggested modified lighting that was employed in
Paris that allowed enough light to see 600 yards ahead and a margin
of safety for motorists.
   ``There is no need to have the `rosy glow' as a guide, and it
would not be a guide if it were extinguished before the raiders
leave the sea. But there is not much in it anyway ...
   ``The penalty we pay for the present methods is very heavy.
First, the loss of life. Secondly, as the secretary of state for
air has protested, the impediment to munitions output; and also
work at the ports ... Thirdly, the irritating and depressing effect
on the people, which is a drag upon their war-making capacity ...
Fourthly, the anxieties of women and young girls in the darkened
streets at night or on blacked-out trains. Fifthly, the effect on
shopping and entertainments.''
   He cited newspaper reports of a man who was prosecuted for
smoking a cigarette too brightly, and another of a mother who was
fined for turning on a light to care for her crying baby.
   Modifying to a dimout, he said, might help Britain make it
through the mist and fog of the three winter months with better
morale and greater safety.
   ``We can always revert to the existing practice if the war
flares up, or if we do anything to provoke reprisals.''
   The war would flare up.
   Before another war-free Christmas Day would dawn, some 50
million people would violently vanish from the face of the Earth.

   For 34 consecutive years, the AP's Hugh Mulligan
has presented readers with a Christmas story. This time he imposed
on one of his friends to offer a frank, revealing, no-holds-barred
recollection of what it's like growing up _ as a reindeer.

<TEXT>
   This time of year you'll find me
everywhere. Even on my home turf, the North Country, I've become a
profit with honor.
   Like today in Stockholm's old city I'm the chef's special on the
dinner menu at the posh Victory Hotel: Renstek Rudolph.
   Across town, the food hall in the Ahlens department store is
offering samples of renklamma, a delicious smoked sausage on barley
bread coated with horseradish butter.
   In chic boutiques all over Scandinavia, you'll find me in a wide
selection of sleeping bags, gloves, parkas, moccasins, snow boots
with curled toes, primitive masks and, of course, on an endless
array of Christmas cards and tree ornaments.
   Finnair has holiday flights to Tormanen, up near the border with
the Soviet Union, so good little boys and girls can visit
Korvatunri, ``the cave of the ears,'' where Father Christmas
overhears petitions for presents under the tree.
   Now the Swedes are selling condominiums to the cross-country ski
set in my frozen stomping ground above the Arctic Circle. Would you
believe one of my mates got hit in the rump with an orange golf
ball the other day while shoveling away the snow with his antlers
to munch on some succulent lichens?
   In Taiwan and Tokyo these antlers are pounded into a powder and
sold as an aphrodisiac, a love potion. Well, why not? At this
festive time of the year, I'm just about the most lovable critter
anywhere.
   In case you haven't guessed, I'm a reindeer, nature's noblest,
and perhaps most useful beast. There are a million like me. Maybe
more, counting herds exported to Alaska and Canada.
   A few Christmases ago the headline writers were composing our
epitaph. That nuclear reactor explosion at Chernobyl spread
cesium-137 all over our grazing territory, which stretches from
Siberia's Kola Peninsula across Finland to Sweden and Norway.
   Experts grimly predicted that our winter food supply of lichens,
which have no roots and take all their nutrients from the air,
would be radioactive for 20 to 30 years. To keep our herders from
going bust, the governments of Norway and Sweden bought up all
contaminated reindeer meat at 1985 prices, dyed it a bright blue,
sold some to the mink farms and buried the rest.
   Can you imagine me, beloved of kids around the world, winding up
in a nuclear waste dump?
   Not to worry. Here it is another Christmas, and reindeer meat,
inspected and approved, is back in the gourmet shops. And we're
still going strong on the hoof, as we have been since the Stone Age
when they painted our picture in shocking pink on the wall of that
cave in France.
   In 40 centuries we haven't changed much: still 3{ feet high,
about the size of a Shetland pony, and weighing in at about 300
pounds. Our distinguishing features are wide, deeply cleft hoofs
for skimming across marshes and snow fields; close haired,
air-filled fur to keep out the cold; a hairy muzzle that serves as
a ski mask, and these velvety antlers, sweeping upward, backward
and forward again into broad tips of moose-like proportions.
   No other branch of the deer family equips both males and females
with this elegant headgear. None lives so far north where the snows
are deepest and food so scarce.
   To brag a bit, I can run faster than a horse, outdistance a pack
of wolves, float like a cork, swim the swiftest rivers, trot 15 mph
with 90 pounds on my back while pulling a sled loaded with 300
pounds and cover 40 to 50 miles a day in a blizzard.
   Over the years, the poets, painters and songwriters have been
generous with their praise, if not always accurate. Like when
Clement Moore wrote in his classic, ``A Visit From St. Nicholas'':
   ``When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
   ``But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.''
   Actually only seven reindeer are hitched to an akjar, the sled
loaded with grandma and the baby, or maybe piled high with tents,
blankets and cooking pots for the spring and autumn migrations that
cover hundreds of miles.
   ``More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,'' continued the
poet. A bit of poetic license there. Eagles are a menace. They can
snatch up a newborn calf quicker than a hungry bear emerging from
his winter hibernation.
   But wolverines are the real enemy. These cunning cousins of the
weasel sneak up behind a reindeer burrowing under the snow and
pounce on his rump.
   Worst of all are the mosquitoes, midges and gadflies that sting
us on the muzzle, causing colds and congestion, and plant their
eggs in the soft flesh under our eyelids, weakening our already
poor vision. No wonder we head for the cool mountains in summer.
   The Christmas card artists got it right, however, about our
herders being short, stocky, cheerful folk who wear curly toed
boots filled with grass, tall pointy hats with funny flaps, and
bright blue, not red, parkas elaborately trimmed with fur,
embroidery, ribbons and sometimes silver.

   Like the sled driver in that poem, they do have ``cheeks like
roses'' and ``a nose like a cherry.'' You'd glow like that, too, if
you dashed out of a night 50 below into a sauna 220 above zero.
   Lapps or Laplanders, these rugged people are still widely called
in Sweden, but in Norway and Finland their official name is Sami.
They have their own language, of remote Hungarian and Finnish
origin, with 120 words for snow and 400 for reindeer.
   Why not? We reindeer are their whole life, culture and history.
Carbon tests on petrified slats found in tundra bogs show they have
been chasing us on cross-country skis since at least 2500 B.C.
   We are their horse, sheep, cow and general store, available in
one portable compact model.
   Tents, blankets, boots, parkas, leggings, sleeping bags are
taken out of our hide. The meat, strong and flavorful, can be
jerked, smoked, boiled or barbecued. Reindeer blood pancakes are an
acquired taste. Our milk is four times richer than a cow's, great
for butter and cheese.
   Bowls, spoons and fish hooks are fashioned from our antlers. Our
sinews contribute harnesses, boot laces, lassos and thread spun on
looms fashioned from our bones, which also provide knife handles,
pack racks and the baby's kemse or cradle, all held together with
glue from our hoofs.
   There really are reindeer games like you hear about in that
Rudolph song. With dice and markers made from our toe bones, the
herder's family gathers in the glow of the tent stove for a board
game called wolf tablo, a variant of chess in which the wolf
gobbles up some reindeer pawns until he finally is cornered.
   Reindeer aren't driven like cattle in the American West. We call
the tune. Instinct dictates where and when we'll mosey off to
richer pastures. The herder and his family just follow along,
listening for the jingle bells around our necks and the hollow
clicking noise the herd makes on the move. Tendons stretching
across our toe bones make a sound like of a bunch of schoolboys
cracking their knuckles.
   Before Norway established border controls in 1912, reindeer used
to roam from the top of the Gulf of Bothania, where Finland and
Sweden meet, all the way to the Atlantic.
   Herding has changed dramatically in recent years. Logging
operations in Finland, NATO bases in Norway and Sweden's
unquenchable appetite for hydroelectric power have shrunk our
traditional grazing ground.
   Many herders have forsaken the old nomadic ways. They use
planes, helicopters and walkie-talkie radios to follow our
migrations.
   In Rovaniemi, up on the Arctic Circle, a Finnish firm called
Rova Elektro is marketing ``reindeer radar'' to replace the bells
around our necks. Some herd handlers these days ride the frozen
range on snowmobiles. ``Tinplate geldings,'' the Sami call them.
   This brings up a delicate subject. A few weeks ago a militant
feminist on a TV talk show called Santa a male chauvinist because
only a token doe, Vixen, made his starting lineup on Christmas Eve.
   The awful truth is that all sled-pulling reindeer are ``harkar''
_ geldings. Castration is performed at the fall roundup, when the
huge herds that summered in the mountains are sorted out by family
ownership for breeding, slaughter or sled training.
   The other big reindeer roundup comes early in spring when the
young calves still following their mothers are literally earmarked
for owner identification.
   I'll never forget the last day of my childhood. A lasso was
thrown over my antlers, and I was bulldogged to the ground like a
calf at a rodeo. The next thing you know the herder's plump wife
was sitting on my flanks and carving a decorative slice out of my
ear with a hunting knife.
   This snippet, along with others, was hung from the tent pole
with care in the time-honored method of reindeer bookkeeping.
Swedish Lapland alone has more than 10,000 legally registered
reindeer earmarks, all different.
   Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer has become what Tin Pan Alley
calls a Golden Oldie. Among us, he's strictly for laughs. What
Rudolph really needed to lead the pack was a glowing taillight. On
our frequent travels through frozen mist and fog, we follow the
wagging white tail of the reindeer just ahead.
   Although St. Andrew's Day, the last Sunday in November, is the
big feast in the North Country, Christmas is a fun time for
reindeer. The air is clean and bracing, fragrant with the scent of
the stunted pines. We come gaily galloping with steam rising from
our muzzles when the herder clangs his ice axe into the frozen snow
to dig us out some tasty holiday tidbits.
   The sun at noon is just an embarrassed blush on the horizon, but
in the diamond-studded long winter night the Northern Lights blaze
purple and red and gold, more dazzling than the Rockefeller Center
tree.
   It makes a reindeer want to sing out like Santa _ or at least
bark, which is what we do: `Happy Christmas to all, and to all a
good night.''

   British actress Marina Sirtis recently scored
a first when she had a steamy love affair on ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation.''
   Sirtis plays Deanna Troi, the half-human, half-betazoid
counselor, on the popular syndicated series. The back story is that
Troi and Cmdr. William Riker, played by Jonathan Frakes, are former
lovers.
   ``We play a lot of stuff between us that ends up on the cutting
room floor,'' Sirtis says. ``The producers don't like the
relationship too much, although the fans love it. The producers
want us to be free to have dalliances with aliens.''
   In a recent episode, Troi had a love scene, which was the first
time on the show two people were shown in bed together.
   ``We got a lot of letters saying you shouldn't have sex on `Star
Trek,''' she says. ``We touch on everything else. It's as though
there's no sex in the 24th century.''
   Despite her striking beauty, jet-black hair and dark eyes,
Sirtis says people seldom recognize her on the street.
   ``I'm only recognized if I want to be recognized, which is good
and bad,'' she says. ``I look different because I wear a wig and
big, black contact lenses with a little hole for me to see through.
   ``I get invited to functions because of the show, and when I
turn up people don't know who I am. That's embarrassing. Especially
if you're trying to impress someone you're with.''
   In person, Sirtis does look different. Her wig hair is pulled
back severely on ``Star Trek.'' Away from the show, her long, dark
hair is full and wavy. She's more animated, has a keen sense of
humor and laughs more than the rather serious Troi. Her English
accent emerges when she's not acting.
   Sirtis had been in this country less than five months when she
auditioned for the new ``Star Trek.'' She originally auditioned for
the role of Lt. Tasha Yar, the security chief, which went to Denise
Crosby.
   In England, she'd done ``Wicked Lady'' with Faye Dunaway and
appeared opposite Charles Bronson in ``Death Wish III.'' She got a
part in ``Hunter'' two weeks after she arrived here and was also on
the TV series ``The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.''
   ``I grew up in London. My parents arrived from Greece three
months before I was born,'' she says. ``I blame my bad temper on
being conceived in Greece. My parents' attitudes were pretty
Victorian, so they saw being an actress as having about the same
respectability as being a lady of the night. I was very bright in
school and my parents had lofty ideas of me becoming a lawyer. I
think my father was quietly supportive before he passed away. I
think with `Star Trek' my mother has finally accepted it.
   ``I came here because my looks went against me in England. They
do a lot of `kitchen sink' dramas about working class problems. I
was working class, I had a terrible cockney accent, but I couldn't
get cast in those things. They said I was too pretty, too
glamorous. I was never the lead. I was always `the other woman.'''
   Sirtis says she had just ended a long relationship and decided
it was time to exercise her ambitions elsewhere.
   ``I'd fought too hard to become an actress, because of my
parents' opposition and the environment I grew up in. I felt I owed
it to myself to do as well as I could,'' she says.
   ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' now in its third season, is
the most successful hour-long drama in syndication. A sequel to the
1960s 22nd century ``Star Trek,'' it is set in the 24th century and
features an all-new cast and a much-improved Starship Enterprise.
Like the original, it was also created by Gene Roddenberry.
   In the beginning, Deanna Troi was a lieutenant commander in the
Star Fleet. She is now a civilian counselor aboard the Enterprise
who uses her unusual senses and ESP to further the crew's mission.
   In the beginning of the series, there were too many stories
about superior beings taking over the Enterprise and challenging
the crew to some sort of test. Now the show emphasizes the
relationships between the crew members and their encounters with
strange worlds and unusual beings. That's what made the original
``Star Trek'' a phenomenal hit.
   ``The relationships are more important than plot,'' Sirtis says.
``The audience wants to see the people interact. Gene doesn't allow
conflicts between the crew members, although I can't imagine any
close relationship over a long period of time that doesn't have
some conflict. Conflict is what an actor sinks his teeth into. We
sneak it in sometimes, and he'll put his foot down.''

   Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire think of
``Closer Than Ever,'' their off-Broadway hit now on view at the
Cherry Lane Theater, as a collection of musical short stories.
   It's not a musical revue and not a book musical, but 25 musical
numbers about contemporary people and the things they do and the
things they feel.
   ``The characters are more three-dimensional than you usually
find in a revue,'' says Shire, the curly haired, soft-spoken half
of the songwriting team. ``And the stories are thematically
related.''
   ``You find yourself moved the way that you would be moved at a
musical or a play,'' Maltby adds. ``I don't know anybody who ever
was moved by a revue. It's not the hallmark of revues to get your
emotions.''
   The four performers _ Brent Barrett, Sally Mayes, Richard Muenz
and Lynne Wintersteller _ sing their hearts out.
   In one wistful song called ``My Life,'' a woman reflects on what
has happened to her failed marriage and faltering career. In
another, a man sings about himself, ``One of the Good Guys,'' who
thinks about the possibility of an affair but keeps true to his
marriage. In a third, ``If I Sing,'' a son pays homage to his
father, thanking him for the success he has had in life.
   Much of the revue started about five years ago as an ``urban
file'' in Maltby's home computer. At the time, the lyricist began
saving notes and jottings from conversations with friends _ most of
them in their late 40s.
   ``They were primarily stories our friends had told us about
their lives,'' Maltby was saying the other day. He thought they
might make interesting subject matter for songs.
   At the same time, Shire, who lives part of the year in
California, bought new synthesizer equipment that he planned to use
for film scoring, something he has done a lot of in movieland.
   ``When I got these new toys, I went into a real improvisational
binge to try them out,'' the composer says. ``Because they were
high-tech, I was playing around with urban sounds. Richard had
said, `Think urban.' So I opened up a computer file in my sequencer
and collected a lot of music.''
   Out of their collaboration came the songs for ``Urban Blight,''
a small revue about the perils of living in New York. The show,
which also had sketches by such established playwrights as
Christopher Durang, Wendy Wasserstein and Terrence McNally, had a
short run at the Manhattan Theater Club.
   But the performers were more actors than singers. Both Maltby
and Shire felt the songs' full potential hadn't been tapped and
wanted to use them again. Some ended up in ``Closer Than Ever.''
   Other songs for ``Closer Than Ever'' were orphans from ``Baby,''
the duo's one Broadway musical that had a seven-month run during
the 1983-84 season.
   ``Twelve songs wound up in `Baby,''' Shire says, ``But we wrote
approximately 50. Some of them deserved to be put away forever.
Others were redundant, but there were three or four which we were
quite proud of and the plot ultimately didn't have room for.''
   Material from ``Baby'' and five songs from ``Urban Blight,''
plus what Shire calls ``odds and ends,'' were ultimately pulled
together by Maltby's assistant, a young director named Steven Scott
Smith, for an evening of entertainment called ``Next Time Now.'' It
was performed last spring by three singers at a New York cabaret
spot called Eighty-Eights. The response was good enough to
encourage further work.
   That refinement occurred at the Williamstown Festival in
Massachusetts in July when Maltby came aboard as co-director of the
show. New songs were written and one more performer added.
   ``A lot of the songs are related to things in our life,'' Shire
says. ``Our work since `Baby' has tended to be more personal, the
things we are feeling and what our friends are feeling. Our
experiences with our wives, our fathers or with fatherhood, for
example.''
   ``And what could have been a grab bag of material turned into an
evening of portraits, a collection of self-contained songs,''
Maltby says.
   Maltby and Shire have been writing together for more than 30
years. They met as freshmen at Yale. Both had musical backgrounds _
their fathers were both bandleaders.
   Musical theater fans know their earlier revue ``Starting Here,
Starting Now,'' which had a short run off-Broadway in 1977. The
show, mostly songs from unproduced Maltby-Shire musicals, became a
cult favorite, thanks to a recording by RCA Victor and numerous
productions around the country. RCA has recorded ``Closer Than
Ever'' in its entirety and will release it in January.
   The two men have also worked separately and with others.
   Maltby was the director of the hit Fats Waller revue ``Ain't
Misbehavin''' and was co-lyricist for ``Miss Saigon,'' London's
newest musical smash which is expected on Broadway in the fall. He
has also written the lyrics for ``Nick and Nora,'' a musical
version of ``The Thin Man,'' also due in New York next season.
   Shire has written scores for more than 40 movies, including
``The Conversation,'' ``All the President's Men'' and ``Farewell,
My Lovely.'' He also picked up an Oscar as composer of the song
``It Goes Like It Goes'' from ``Norma Rae.'' And he's currently
working on a stage adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel, ``God
Knows,'' with Joseph Stein and Barry Harman.
   Still, they have always come back to work with each other.
   ``We've worked every way possible, but mainly sitting together
in rooms for very long periods of time being each other's gadfly,
cheering section and artistic conscience,'' Shire says. ``We throw
away a lot of each other's material.''
   Maltby and Shire worked on ``Closer Than Ever'' right up to its
opening in November, adding a new song shortly before previews
started and carefully going over lyrics to existing ones.
   ``Truthfully, most of the songs never have a moment when they
are done,'' Maltby says. ``There just is a moment when you stop
working on them. Then suddenly, you go into rehearsal and somewhere
along the way you realize they are in the show.''

   Carlos Saul Menem, the president
of Argentina, recalls his days growing up. He, his brothers and
mother all worked in the general store of his father, a Moslem who
arrived penniless from Syria after the turn of the century.
   ``He was a street vendor'' in a hot, backwater province until he
saved enough to buy the store, Menem said. After several setbacks,
the business prospered and the father, Saul, insisted his four sons
go to college.
   ``He instilled in us the need ... to study for a career,'' said
Menem, who became a lawyer, provincial governor and, last July, was
elected president on the Peronist ticket. ``He used to say the only
safe thing in life was a university degree.''
   Menem, 59, typifies the Arab experience not only in Argentina
but across Latin America.
   The descendants of tens of thousands of Arabs who fled poverty
and oppression and settled in cities and towns across Latin America
and throughout the Caribbean have become figures of consequence in
business, the armed forces and, increasingly, politics.
   Some have achieved fame, others notoriety.
   In Brazil, three of the 22 candidates for president in the first
round of elections Nov. 15 were of Lebanese descent, including
Paulo Salim Maluf, former mayor of Sao Paulo.
   In Ecuador, the Lebanese-descended Bucaram family has produced
two presidents of Congress, Assad and his son, Averroes; and one
candidate for president, Assad's nephew Abdala.
   Prominent Chileans of Arab descent include Dr. Elias Neghme,
former dean of the medical school at the University of Chile;
Rafael Tauro, a former Cabinet minister and president of the bar
association; and Sabino Awad and Juan Carlos Esguep, both of whom
have headed Chile's Olympic Committee.
   The Argentine list includes the philosopher-diplomat Victor
Massuh, former secretary general of UNESCO, pianist Miguel Angel
Estrella, novelist Jorge Asis, the Saadi and Sapag families who
have served as provincial governors and national senators, and
Menem's brother Eduardo, president of the Senate.
   ``We are the third biggest ethnic group in Argentina,'' after
the Spanish and Italians, said Ramez Chacra, past president of the
Federation of Arab American Entities.
   ``Don't think that the glory of Arabs in Argentina started with
Menem,'' Chacra, a clothing wholesaler, said good naturedly between
phone calls, sips of black coffee and instructions to employees in
his busy store. ``He just made us fashionable.''
   Arabs began arriving in large numbers at the end of the last
century. Waves followed the end of each of the world wars.
   ```Arab' immigration really means Syria, Lebanon, Palestine _
the parts of the decaying Ottoman Empire that were subject to
religious discrimination, military draft, persecution, massacre,''
said Zake Consul, cultural affairs officer at the Syrian Embassy in
Buenos Aires.
   Today, 15 million people of Arab descent live in Latin America,
according to the Arab American federation, which is based in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, and has branches in 22 countries. Brazil has the
most at 8 million, with Argentina next at 2 million, Chacra said.
   The first immigrants intended to make money and return home,
Consul said. When that proved impossible, they settled in.
   By most accounts, they were warmly received.
   ``Arabs coming to Chile found the generosity of the Chilean
people, their warm reception,'' said Nelson Hadad, a lawyer and
leading member of the Arab community in Santiago. ``Our
grandparents, our parents always tell us that.''
   Monsour Challita, director of the Gibran International Cultural
Center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and former ambassador of the
League of Arab States, said, ``The Lebanese found for the first
time a country they could count on to protect them, and a friendly
hospitable people.''
   Many immigrants were Orthodox Christians, not Moslems; they
mostly spoke French, not Arabic. They assimilated easily, learning
Portuguese in Brazil and Spanish in the other countries.
   Many descendants, including Menem, were baptized as Roman
Catholics, the dominant religion in the region, and assimilated so
completely they do not speak or write the language of their parents.
   Some changed their names to lessen what discrimination there
was, or simply to fit in better. Alferez, which means ``the
horseman'' in Arabic, became Alvarez in Argentina. In Brazil,
Haddad became Ferreira (both mean ``smith'' in their languages),
Zaituni became Oliveira (both mean ``olive'' or ``olive tree'').
   Initially, the new arrivals were called ``Turks'' because they
carried Turkish passports. That sobriquet is inaccurate and is
considered pejorative.
   In Jorge Amado's novel ``Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon,'' set in
the Brazilian city of Ilheus, Gabriela is married to cafe owner
Nacib, a Syrian who protests violently when townspeople call him
``Turk.''
   As brothers and cousins joined family members who arrived
earlier, the Arabs quickly spread out.
   Social and cultural clubs are common, but Arab neighborhoods _
such as Rua da Alfandega in Rio de Janeiro, a street lined with
Arab shops and restaurants _ are rare, as are examples of Arab
architecture, like mosques.
   ``The Arab community never has been a ghetto,'' noted Hadad, the
Chilean attorney. ``It has always been an active, integrated part
of Chilean society. ... We are Chileans. We feel Chilean.''
   Arabs have played controversial or highly publicized roles in
their adopted societies.
   Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin led a nationistic sector of
Argentina's army that rebelled against former President Raul
Alfonsin in December 1988. Seineldin recently was ordered into
retirement.
   Police in Brazil are looking for Naji Nahas, a billionaire
investor who vanished in August after being indicted in connection
with a stock market scandal.
   Nahim Isaias, a banking and press magnate and one of the richest
men in Ecuador, was kidnapped and held for ransom in 1985 by the
Alvaro Vive and was killed in a shootout between that subversive
group and police.
   In Haiti, landowner Rendall Assad in the 1960s hid dissidents
from dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier at his hotel Villa
Creole, which still sits halfway up the mountain to the wealthy
suburb Petionville from the slums of downtown Port-au-Prince.
   On the other side of the island of Hispaniola, in the Dominican
Republic, Jacobo Majluta Azar narrowly lost the presidential
election in 1986, and is a front-runner in the polling set for next
year.

   The Colombian government's war on
drugs has brought hard times to Miraflores, typical of the towns in
Colombia where people earn a living by growing the coca leaves that
are processed into cocaine.
   And hard times could mean social unrest in an area where
anti-government guerrillas operate.
   When the government declared its war Aug. 19, the demand for
coca leaf dried up around Miraflores as traffickers disappeared to
avoid arrest. The price of coca base, which is made into cocaine,
fell from $660 to $330 a kilogram _ 2.2 pounds. Prices have
fluctuated since then and recently were about $475 a kilogram.
   Many of Miraflores' residents, who were barely making a living
by growing coca even when prices were high, now say they have been
pushed to the economic brink.
   ``We ask ourselves what we're going to do,'' said David
Gonzales, a coca grower. ``I mean, are we going to have to declare
war in order to get enough food to feed our families?''
   Authorities estimate 80 percent of Miraflores' 17,000 people
depend on coca cultivation for their livelihood. The town, 267
miles southeast of Bogota near the headwaters of the Vaupes River,
can be reached only by air; no roads go out from it to areas where
farmers could sell other crops, such as corn or rice.
   Peasants who work on the small farms owned by big coca producers
earn the equivalent of $95 a month, Colombia's minimum wage.
   A farmer working his own one or two acres might average $7 for a
10-hour day. Most growers in Miraflores work for others and grow
their own coca crops as well.
   Authorities estimate 550 to 1,100 pounds of coca leaves are
needed to produce one kilogram of coca base. The amount of leaf
required varies with its quality and with the efficiency of the
processing.
   The anti-narcotics police chief in Miraflores, Lt. Edgar
Bejarano, said Miraflores' population has decreased 30 percent in
the past three months. He and other officials attributed the exodus
to the government's war on traffickers.
   ``These days, traffickers are all on the run,'' said Javier
Echeverry, the head of the government's agricultural development
corporation in the region. ``Since there is no one to buy coca, the
price has fallen.''
   Any drop in the Colombian coca supply probably will not affect
cocaine availability in the United States, since most coca is grown
in neighboring Peru and in Bolivia.
   But the Colombian government's war on drugs is almost certain to
add instability in Miraflores and other coca-growing regions in
Colombia.
   Roberto Martinez, a former grower, has managed to stay in
Miraflores although he abandoned his 25-acre coca field near the
town when prices of coca first began to fall in 1983 because of
overproduction.
   He got a job as a loader with one of the cargo airlines serving
Miraflores.
   Martinez said most people who quit cultivating coca had not been
so lucky. The choice is often between going hungry and getting out.
   ``They leave, but they don't have anywhere to go,'' he said.
``There are no jobs for them anywhere else in Colombia, and many of
them turn to crime. The problems with coca are generating social
problems.''
   Farmers added that the influence of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the country's oldest and largest
anti-government guerrilla group, is likely to grow in the area
along with the economic misery.
   Coca grower Gonzalez said people now are listening to the
guerrillas' argument that armed revolution is the only way to
better their lives.
   ``If the government really wants to get rid of the guerrillas,
it should do something to help us,'' he said.
   Colombia produces only about one tenth of the coca grown in the
Andean region, but the Guaviare region encompassing Miraflores
accounts for 80 percent of Colombian coca.
   Since no roads run to Miraflores, nine daily cargo flights, old
propeller driven planes, are the town's only link to the rest of
Colombia.
   The planes bring food, liquor, cosmetics _ almost everything the
residents need _ including the gasoline they pour on coca leaves to
extract juices.
   Another problem for growers is that the planes are bringing far
less gasoline than they did three months ago. Bejarano, whose
police platoon controls the airstrip, said he had cut gasoline
shipments to 10,000 gallons from 40,000 gallons in an effort to
slow coca base processing.
   The move has angered farmers.
   ``This is a military dictatorship down here,'' said Gonzalez,
surrounded by other growers as he talked to a reporter in a wooden
shack that has been converted into a bar.
   Almost all of the men who said they grew coca expressed a desire
to get out of the business, which they say no longer is profitable,
but not much is in store for them.
   In boom years, growers made thousands of dollars a month but
beginning in 1983 found themselves trying to eke out a living.
   Farmers could not pay their debts, and lenders working for drug
traffickers began settling scores with bullets. That brought in the
police and army reinforcements and Miraflores suffered a wave of
violence that left scores of dead every week.
   Even with the drop in prices, communities like Miraflores that
can be reached only by plane, coca is likely to be the principal
crop for years to come.
   Farmers in Miraflores say they try to keep growing coca because,
as poorly as the crop pays, the alternatives are even worse.
   Under its National Rehabilitation Plan, the government set up a
program to buy corn and other crops from farmers in backward areas
and has subsidized them by paying the high cost of air transport to
markets hundreds of miles away.
   But the high production cost of corn and other alternative crops
in isolated areas limits farmers' interest in the program.
   Some growers in Miraflores said they will try to get by until
the price of coca goes back up.

   A socialist and a pro-business
advocate are squaring off in a presidential runoff election seen as
Brazil's last chance to peacefully resolve deep-seated social and
economic problems.
   Some 82 million voters are eligible to choose on Sunday between
conservative Fernando Collor de Mello and radical leftist Luis
Inacio Lula da Silva in the second round of Brazil's first free
presidential election since 1960.
   The two led a 21-candidate field in the first round Nov. 15, but
neither obtained the majority required by law. The winner will
succeed President Jose Sarney for a five-year term starting March
15.
   Both Collor de Mello and da Silva are young, charismatic leaders
with broad support among Brazil's poor majority. Both started their
political rise during the 1964-1985 right-wing military regime.
Both are harsh critics of the Sarney government, which they accuse
of being inept and corrupt.
   But the two differ sharply on the solutions for Brazil's
economic and social problems, which include 1,460 percent
inflation, widespread poverty and a $110 billion foreign debt, the
largest in the Third World.
   Many see the election as a last chance for a peaceful resolution
of Brazil's glaring social and economic inequalities. The World
Bank says, for example, that Brazil's income distribution is the
most unequal anywhere.
   ``If the new government doesn't solve Brazil's problems, it will
face a crisis and collapse in economic and social chaos: food
shortages, looting of supermarkets, paralyzation of public
services, the middle class attacked by starving masses,'' said
political scientist Helio Jaguaribe. ``Everything indicates
democracy will not survive,''
   The favorite is Collor de Mello, 40, who founded his
center-right National Reconstruction Party just 10 months ago.
   The scion of a wealthy political clan in the tiny sugar
cane-growing state of Alagoas in the impoverished Northeast, Collor
de Mello won tremendous popularity with promises to clean up
corrupt government.
   His well-cut suits, aquiline good looks and stinging attacks on
Sarney captured the imagination of poor voters. He also is backed
by right-wing parties, businessmen, big landowners and the powerful
Globo TV network, Brazil's largest.
   His critics say Collor de Mello's record belies his posture as a
moralizer. They point out he was a member of the old military
regime's political party and was accused of payroll padding and
favoring the sugar barons while governor of Alagoas.
   ``Collor de Mello has an image as an anti-politician, a man
against the system,'' Jaguaribe said. ``He hides his center-right
tendency behind a moralist pose.''
   The 44-year-old da Silva, popularly known as Lula, a nickname he
had legalized, is a congressman and former lathe operator who is
the candidate of the radical left Workers Party.
   A grade-school dropout, the stocky, bearded da Silva became
nationally known in 1980 when he led a strike against Brazil's
foreign-owned auto industry. He later was sentenced to 3{ years in
prison for breaking the National Security Law but wound up serving
just 30 days, as the ruling generals announced a plan for a gradual
return of civilian liberties.
   In 1986, both Collor de Mello and da Silva moved toward national
recognition in politics.
   Collor de Mello switched to the opposition Brazilian Democratic
Movement Party, was elected governor of Alagoas and made national
headlines by firing so-called ``maharajas,'' local civil servants
making thousands of dollars a months mostly through political
connections.
   Da Silva was elected to Congress in 1986 with more votes than
any other candidate. He is supported by leftist labor groups,
intellectuals and the dominant liberal wing of Brazil's Roman
Catholic Church.
   The winner will take on the task of leading a country of 150
million people with the Western world's eighth-largest economy, but
in which the richest 1 percent owns as much as the poorest 50
percent, and half the work force earns the equivalent of $20 a week
or less.
   Both candidates say fighting inflation is the No. 1 priority and
promise to court foreign investment. But they diverge sharply on
other issues.
   Collor de Mello proposes to cut spending and ``privatize'' many
state-run companies. He favors a conventional approach to the $110
billion foreign debt but would limit repayments to 2 percent of the
gross national product, or about $5 billion a year, about a third
of what Brazil now pays.
   Da Silva promises higher wages, curbs on profits and an
immediate moratorium on foreign debt payments. He is against the
sale of state companies and spending cuts.
   ``To raise salaries, someone has to lose,'' the gravelly voiced
candidate said in a recent televised debate. ``It's impossible to
fight inflation without suspending payment of the foreign debt.''
   The gap between the candidates has polarized the election into a
battle of left vs. right, rich vs. poor, socialism vs. free market.
   ``Brazil is in a state of war, and in war you have to take
sides. I want to take the side of the poor, whom Lula represents,''
Bishop Mauro Morelli of Duque de Caxias, an impoverished city near
Rio de Janeiro, said in an interview.
   Collor de Mello has played on the elite's fear of a da Silva
government. He warned of a ``blood bath'' if the leftist wins.
   ``Lula's radical ideas mean strikes and chaos,'' says one
campaign advertisement for Collor de Mello. ``Foreign investment
will leave Brazil. Lula is a step backward for Brazil.''
   Mario Amato, president of the influential Federation of
Industries of the State of Sao Paulo predicted that ``800,000
businessmen will flee the country'' if da Silva is elected.
   Da Silva's campaign ads counter that Collor de Mello is a
``creation of the dictatorship'' and advise viewers, ``Don't put a
fox in charge of the henhouse.''
   ``Lula is virtually the only national leader who can say, `I am
from the people. I look like the people.' He has real
credibility,'' Alfred Stepan, professor of political science and
dean of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
University in New York, said in an interview in Sao Paulo, where he
attended a recent seminar.
   While the campaign has stirred passions among voters _ 73
percent of whom never cast a ballot for president _ the campaign
has been remarkably peaceful.
   ``For a country to come out of 21 years of military rule with
the worst income distribution in the world and have the majority of
the people committed to democratic change is extraordinary,''
Stepan said.
   The last elected president was Janio Quadros in 1960. He
abruptly resigned after seven months in office claiming an
``oligarchy'' sought to disrupt his presidency. The ensuing
confusion led to an armed forces coup in 1964. Sarney, a civilian,
was chosen in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated by the
military government.

<HEAD>A Video Christmas, Or, How To Spend $1,500 Without Half Trying</HEAD>

   Stuck on what to buy this Christmas?
   Make it video!
   Whether you want to splurge, spree, invest or just stuff a few
stockings, here are some wonderful items to buy and some excellent
excuses for buying them.
   SPLURGE:
   A new television set with a 27-inch screen.
   If you're a typical American, you've been watching that 19-inch
tube for more than a few years while new technology has been making
it obsolete.
   This is no time to wait for High Definition TV. The best
estimates put HDTV at least five years away from the expensive end
of the marketplace and maybe even longer before it's affordable in
the mass consumer market.
   Japanese manufacturers are designing video and audio circuitry
that tweaks the TV signal for all it's worth. They make ``enhanced
definition'' with much sharper pictures, even if you live in an
area where cable TV isn't available everywhere. Much of the
broadcast soundtrack in major U.S. cities is in hi-fi stereo, so a
tinny little speaker just isn't going to make it for the 1990s.
   An ``inexpensive'' 19-inch set costs about $200 in a discount
house. It's about $400 for a 19-inch TV loaded with the new
technology, and about $700 for a low-end, high-tech 27-inch tube.
   In areas where such electronic goods are heavily discounted, you
can shop around and get a stunning, stereophonic ``cable-ready'' TV
set for less than $1,000. We're talking automatic tuning, inputs
for multiple video sources, outputs to your home stereo, a
``smart'' remote control and a picture that'll knock your eyes out.
Go for it.

<TEXT>
   SPREE:
   A combination LaserDisc and compact disc player.
   If you haven't already taken the plunge into digital audio for
your home stereo, you should. Compact discs don't wear out and make
any stereo system sound startlingly better. The budget-minded
approach is to buy a small portable unit to start, then trade up to
a full-featured model. But if you've got some Christmas money to
throw around, why not get into digital audio with a machine that
also plays videos? They cost around $500 in the discount houses,
but the LaserDisc image is said to be 60 percent sharper than the
best VHS player and the sound quality is just like a CD.
   Newly released LaserDiscs are sometimes cheaper than VHS tapes.
A VHS new release that retails for $89.95 is in the video disc rack
for $49.95, and some may sell for $29.95. And in theory LaserDiscs
don't wear out and the digital signal will never become obsolete.
   Also, there are certain features you can't get with a VCR, such
as ``letterbox'' formatting that allows you to see the wide screen
image.
   In the ``full-feature'' LaserDisc format, the producers include
incredibly comprehensive supplementary material. The three-disc
package for the 1936 classic musical ``Showboat'' includes excerpts
from the 1929 Universal film version, excerpts of Ziegfield's 1932
Broadway revival, interviews with stars, a color film documentary
on showboats, a visual essay of 300 stills tracing the history of
showboats and the history of the musical on stage, screen and
radio, and enough other archival material to choke a librarian.

   INVEST:
   _A VHS player.
   Not a recorder, mind you, but a transportable, play-only machine
that can run off a 12-volt car, boat or RV system and is about half
the size and half the cost of a videocassette recorder.
   It's great to have a backup when your main VCR breaks down. It's
great to have a portable VCR when you're on vacation or out of the
country. You have to look for these, but they're available at most
video dealers and start at around $150.
   _A four-head, hi-fi, Super VHS videocassette recorder. Or, at
the very least, a stereo VCR that you can pipe through your home
audio system.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STOCKING STUFFERS:
   _A non-abrasive VCR head cleaner. Use it only when you have
significant deterioration in picture quality. Tape heads are
delicate, precision devices and should not be messed with.
   _Blank tapes. People never have enough blank tapes and they
never buy themselves high quality tapes.
   _Videocassette storage racks. People never have enough places to
store videocassettes, which need and deserve a safe, dust-free
resting place.
   _A year's worth of cable TV service. Surprisingly affordable.
Gift certificates are available. Call your local cable company for
details.
   _Videocassettes. Most people are surprisingly reluctant to buy
themselves their favorite movies, and you usually know what your
friends and relatives enjoy, from ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles''
to rock concert videos, operas and great games of the World Series.
   Even better, the emergence of big retail video chains and the
plethora of available programming has pushed down the price of
video software.
   Suprisingly, the monster hits of recent years are most heavily
discounted. ``Batman,'' the summer megahit, is couponed, rebated
and generally knocked down to less than $20. ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit'' lists for about $20; ``E.T. The Extraterrestrial'' is
about $25. ``The Right Stuff'' lists for around $30, and the newly
restored version of ``Lawrence of Arabia'' is $40.
   There's also an abundance of competitively priced,
Christmas-oriented programming in video stores at this time of the
year, from old favorites such as Irving Berlin's ``Holiday Inn'' to
cartoons that will hose down the kids late on Christmas Day.
   _LaserDiscs. Any great film makes for a great disc, and most are
digitally remastered to take advantage of the technology. ``Blade
Runner'' is a big favorite; so are ``Gone With the Wind'' (cropped
back down to its original format and its colors restored) and ``The
Godfather.'' But the hit pick for Christmas giving has to be
``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   The 1962 Academy Award-winning film was restored from its
original negatives under the supervision of director David Lean,
who added 20 minutes of footage cut from the original release. The
standard CLV ($49.95) and the extended play (3 discs, $124.95 list)
contain copious supplementary material.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOME VIDEO DON'Ts:
   _Don't buy for video collectors without very specific knowledge
or instruction. Either they'll already have it, they'll quibble at
the quality of the recording or the format, or they'll say they
only wanted ```Ishtar,' any format, man.''
   Buy them a can of compressed air for blowing dust out of their
machines or a spray bottle of glass cleaner and no-lint paper
towels. Buy them a videocassette rewinder (battery-powered, $29.95
at Radio Shack) or a bulk eraser to get rid of unwanted recordings.
   _Don't forget to buy ``Instant Fireplace,'' at $9.95 _ the
logical culmination of a television culture. Put the cassette in
the VCR. Punch ``play.'' Watch the video of fire burning in
fireplace. Listen to the appropriate music. Wonder about the
decline of the West.

   ``Let Love Rule'' (Virgin) _ Lenny Kravitz
   
   Quick now _ the cover of Lenny Kravitz's ``Let Love Rule'' album
pictures a black man in dreadlocks with a ring through his nose.
What type of music does the cover protect?
   Your first guess was probably not a singer-songwriter album that
owes much to the 1970s work of such artists as Paul McCartney and
Stevie Wonder.
   But confounding expectations is Kravitz's game. His debut album
is encouraging in several respects. First, it's nice to see an
artist _ any artist _ break past stereotypes at a time when racial
tension is high and too many people have closed-minded views about
what's ``black music'' or ``white music.''
   Second, it's encouraging that any company in the conservative
record business will allow a brand new artist to produce, write and
perform an album virtually by himself. Many established artists
don't get the same trust.
   Of course, the clear danger in these ``homemade'' projects is
too much self-indulgence. Yes, ``Let Love Rule'' suffers from this.
But what it lacks in slickness it frequently makes up for in charm
and intimacy.
   With its overly polite, workmanlike drumming, ``Let Love Rule''
sounds much like McCartney's first solo album. Kravitz also shows a
fondness for the hippie era in his lyrics for such songs as ``I
Build This Garden for Us.''
   The soaring title track is one of this rookie's best moments, as
is ``Mr. Cab Driver.'' In the latter, Kravitz accompanies himself
on fuzztone guitar while telling of a cab driver passing him up for
a ride because of his dreads and skin color. He ends with an
expletive.
   ``My Precious Love,'' a gospel number with guest organist Henry
Hirsch, is another high point. ``Be'' sounds strikingly like
Plastic Ono Band-era John Lennon.
   Be forewarned, though: ``Let Love Rule'' begins to get ponderous
toward the end, with many arrangements crawling.
   Kravitz may not be the genius that this self-produced effort
seems to herald. But simply dismissing him as Mr. Lisa Bonet (his
TV-star wife) is a mistake. He's got enough talent and strength of
convictions to merit watching.

   Variations on a Theme by Hindemith, Symphony No. 2, by William
Walton (EMI) _ the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, conducted by
Vernon Handley
   
   Here is a regional European orchestra that performs difficult
music at the highest level. Handley elicits crackling yet
controlled performances. The Bournemouth musicians play with the
clarity and solidity typical of many British orchestras; the winds,
particularly in the symphony's Andante movement, play real chamber
music.
   Walton's idiom, though at times reminiscent of Nielsen and
Bartok, is highly original and produces an abundance of orchestral
sounds. His music is worth getting to know.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Roger Moore Goes for the `Bullseye'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For actor Roger Moore, James Bond is a closed
chapter, except for occasional snatches of Bondian repartee.
   ``The only time you don't want a tape recorder is under the
bed,'' he jokes to an interviewer on the set of ``Bullseye,'' his
latest movie.
   Moore, who took over from Sean Connery as Agent 007, is 62 now
and taking it easy. He tried a musical and quit during rehearsals.
``Bullseye,'' he says, is ``an extension of our home life,''
because it pairs him with an old friend, Michael Caine. His
daughter also has a part.
   He has an easy, unpretentious manner, and looks fit enough to do
another Bond movie or two. But ``A View to a Kill,'' in 1985, was
his seventh and last and there are no plans for him to play the
role again. Before that he did eight years as ``The Saint'' on
television.
   In ``Bullseye,'' he and Caine play double roles as a pair of
unsuccessful con men and as crooked atom scientists selling state
secrets. Sally Kirkland, a 1987 Academy Award nominee for ``Anna,''
plays the girl they once shared. Deborah Barrymore, Moore's
26-year-old daughter, plays an undercover CIA agent.
   The $15 million comedy caper, directed by Michael Winner
(``Death Wish,'' ``A Chorus of Disapproval''), comes from Menahem
Golan's 21st Century productions, and is due for U.S. release late
next summer.
   Leslie Bricusse's script allows Moore to show off a David
Niven-esque comic touch that was often lacking in the Bond movies.
   Moore traces his friendship with the 56-year-old Caine to the
1960s, when he bumped into him on a London street.
   ``I'd seen him on TV, stopped him and told him I thought he had
a future,'' recalled Moore, adding teasingly: ``It shows how wrong
I was.''
   Michael and Shakira Caine and Roger and Luisa Moore have often
stayed with each other in Switzerland or Los Angeles. Their first
children were born six weeks apart, so the two wives ``shared''
their pregnancies, Moore said.
   Both actors are of humble London origins: Caine an East End
cockney, Moore a policeman's son. But Moore says their approach to
work is different.
   Unlike the ever-busy Caine, Moore insists: ``I'm very happy not
working. ... I don't need work to keep me happy.''
   ``If you really want to act you have to want to do it more than
anything. You have to be willing to put up with crap at all levels,
including the food you eat and sometimes the food you don't eat,''
he said.
   He surprised the entertainment world by taking a singing role in
Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical, ``Aspects of Love.'' But he
bowed out in March, six weeks into rehearsal, saying he couldn't
sing the part.
   ``It's all right, I suppose, if you're 20: You jump in, and you
do it. Otherwise, you're up there to be sniped at; it's very much a
no-win situation.''
   He has one film awaiting release, ``Bed and Breakfast'' with
Talia Shire and Colleen Dewhurst, and another comedy set to roll
early next year.
   He thinks acting is a tougher profession than when he started
out more than 30 years ago.
   ``There were more provincial theaters, more repertory theaters,
more of a chance to learn acting,'' said Moore, who spent three
terms at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before leaving to
get practical experience in provincial repertory.
   ``Now, you're thrown into the deep end; you don't have time to
learn. No one has time to teach you anything.''
   He says he is neutral about his daughter's decision to go into
acting.
   ``I didn't encourage her, I didn't discourage her,'' said Moore,
who has two other children, both sons. ``There's a lot of heartache
attached to it, a lot of hard work.''
   Deborah Moore is a graduate of the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art. She changed her stage surname to Barrymore because
there's another Deborah Moore in British Equity, the actors' union.
   Her father doesn't think his fame has advanced her career: ``I
think I've been a hindrance to her.
   ``There are an awful lot of socialists out there who hate
success, who hate anything associated with success, so they think
I'm successful and they say, `Oh, we'll get somebody else.'
   ``You will note,'' he added wryly, ``that I am slightly right
wing of Attila.''
   Nepotism, Moore says, is not what it used to be.
   He says people think Deborah's related to Drew Barrymore, the
young star of ``E.T The Extraterrestrial,'' and adds with a laugh:
``It makes it worse.''

<HEAD>From `Death Wish' to a New Wish: Winner's Return to Comedy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-WKD--Bullseye, b0856</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thinking back on his career, Michael Winner finds
something very odd.
   And that is, he said, that ``a very sophisticated British chap
who lives in a stately home in London has made more films probably
than most Americans in the worst slums of America.''
   Winner is a Cambridge University-educated sort of chap who puffs
cigars and is best known for directing the ``Death Wish'' series of
movies about vigilante warfare against the punks, rapists and
muggers of America.
   Now he has gone back to trying to make people laugh.
   ``I sort of slipped into this bath of blood and made all those
pictures, and I decided I had to do something myself to get back,''
Winner said during a break on the set of ``Bullseye,'' his comedy
caper starring Roger Moore and Michael Caine.
   Due for summer release and budgeted at $15 million, ``Bullseye''
pairs Caine and Moore for the first time on-screen, playing dual
roles as con men and atom scientists.
   On one recent day, Winner was shooting at the west London
location of Syon House, home since 1594 to the Dukes of
Northumberland and substantially redesigned two centuries later by
architect Robert Adam and master landscape-gardener Capability
Brown.
   It's a long way from Winner's urban nightmares starring Charles
Bronson, and the director acknowledged he was more in his element
here.
   ``I'm more at home as we talk here in a wonderful 18th century
palazzo, which is the sort of place I live in,'' said Winner, who
lives in a London mansion in the Bayswater district with British
actress Jenny Seagrove.
   ``It's quite nice to be back in a more sophisticated area.''
   Winner makes no apologies for the violence that has often
defined his films, from ``The Mechanic'' in 1972 to the three
``Death Wish'' movies.
   ``I think they were good thrillers,'' said Winner, whose films
have been accused of irresponsibly encouraging viewers to take the
law into their own hands.
   ``I have many friends who are muggers in the Bronx and Harlem
and East New York. They are fascinating people, underused people,
who have to make do when society rejects them. I love the people
there,'' he said.
   Winner started out as a critic and journalist. His early movies
were comedies, among them a caper film ``The Jokers,'' with Oliver
Reed and Michael Crawford. But his comedies on the whole have not
done well, critically or financially.
   His 1975 ``Won Ton Ton the Dog Who Saved Hollywood'' flopped,
despite a starry supporting cast including Henny Youngman, Joan
Blondell, Milton Berle and Edgar Bergen.
   He has just come out with ``A Chorus of Disapproval,'' his film
of Alan Ayckbourn's acclaimed play, to a lukewarm critical
reception.
   The ``Bullseye'' casting coup was his idea, based, he says, on
having watched Caine and Moore at dinner parties and seeing ``how
wonderfully they work together as a comedy act socially.
   ``We've always said we must find something ...and it just
happened merely by chance: I found this script that needed a lot of
work but was basically a wonderful piece for them, so here we are.''
   Winner said the stars' off-screen rapport was evident on screen.
   ``They will often carry on a scene with ad libs of their own,''
he said. ``There's a shorthand both during the shooting and during
the lunch break and all the time.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Artist Sculpts With Explosives</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sculpture is risky business for French artist
Chantal Cottet. Instead of chisels, she sculpts with dynamite, hand
grenades and artillery shells.
   Cottet, 39, is the inventor of ``blast art,'' a term she created
to describe the jagged hunks of twisted steel born from her
carefully planned explosions.
   Her studio is located on her family's farm outside Paris in the
middle of corn and beet root fields stretching as far as the eye
can see. Yet the explosions she sets off, using between 11 and 33
pounds of dynamite, rattle windows in villages miles away.
   The farm is dotted with sculpture of all shapes and sizes
including a giant mushroom form made from an imploded gas canister,
and graceful flower pots sprouting stainless steel tulips from
inside.
   During a recent interview, Cottet demonstrated her art. She used
penthrite, the same explosive that police say was used to bomb a
passenger jet of the French airline UTA last October over West
Africa.
   ``The penthrite itself isn't dangerous. Things get risky the
moment you connect the explosive to the detonator,'' she said,
holding up the two-inch device. ``If this goes off before I'm
ready, I'll lose three fingers and an eye.''
   The most treacherous aspect of her work, she explained, comes
from elements she cannot control _ such as the random electrical
current generated by high-speed trains passing by just 164 feet
from the woods where she does the blasting _ and which could, in
fact, ignite the explosive before she is safely away.
   Preparations for the explosion took more than an hour. Cottet
wrapped the plastic-coated penthrite cords in a spiral design
around the insides of a cylindrical steel frame that supported a
vacuum-sealed aluminum can.
   At one point, the rusted frame tipped over, with Cottet inside,
and narrowly missed the water table in which the explosion was to
take place.
   Once the can was secured inside the frame, it was lowered into
the vat. Cottet then wound up an electrical sparker that set off
the blast.
   ``Three, two, one,'' she yelled. Yanking the lever, the loud
blast sent a shower of water high into the air, wetting onlookers.
   Steam rose from the churning water. The frame was hoisted high
in the air, and there was Cottet's sculpture _ a dripping, crumpled
aluminum can filled with dirt balls.
   But she is only half-pleased.
   ``The hardest part of my work is trying to determine how the
material is going to react, given the amount of explosive used and
how it is attached,'' she said. ``This isn't bad, but I think I'll
explode it again to open up the top part.''
   The second explosion _ this time on the ground _ takes visitors
watching from behind a shatter-proof glass window by surprise as
the can is propelled into the air behind a cloud of pungent smoke.
The carcass will become a finished work of art once it is washed
and polished.
   Cottet has been working with explosives for seven years, ever
since the day she found an abandoned, rusting gas canister ``a
bunch of kids probably blew up for fun.''
   ``Its hollow shape was what I'd been trying to achieve in marble
and wood for a long time,'' she said. ``The moment I saw the can, I
knew I'd found my calling.''
   She has perfected her knowledge and use of explosives during
frequent seminars at French military bases. In the beginning, she
was the oddball artist. Today, she is known to everyone, and is
taken seriously enough to receive grants from the Culture and
Defense ministries.
   Besides penthrite and dynamite, which she stores in special,
temperature and humidity-controlled closets protected by
sophisticated alarm systems, Cottet sculpts with hand grenades and
artillery shells.
   She finds out when the military base in Bourges is planning to
fire missiles and artillery shells, and places her material in the
right position so it will be blown up in the way she wants.
   ``Look at this piece of armored steel,'' she said caressing the
hundreds of jagged dents left by bullets. ``Isn't it beautiful?''
   Not everyone agrees. The artist has run into considerable
opposition, not only from art institutions such as the Beaux Art
academy where she trained, but also from private galleries,
collectors _ and even fellow artists.
   ``People told me I was crazy when I began working with
explosives. They might look at the sculpture and say they like it,
but when they find out it was done with explosives, they shy
away,'' she said.
   But she dismissed the idea that her work is off-putting because
it bears the traces of violence, and ultimately death. ``To me, the
sculpture conveys notions of power and energy latent in the metal.''
   She likes being called a pioneer, but is sorry she has no
students to train.
   ``I'm sure huge strides could be made in this field if there
were more of us,'' she said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: World Music for Peter Gabriel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, Peter Gabriel bought his first
drum machine. All he needed were rhythms to program.
   Bored with rock 'n' roll, the former star of Genesis looked to
Africa, Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere.
   He couldn't believe what he was hearing, the freshest grooves,
the richest harmonies: spirituals from Pakistan; African jazz from
Tabu Ley of Zaire; Cuba's Orquesta Reve, perfomers of ``son,'' the
root of modern salsa.
   His music was never the same. Gabriel began experimenting with
rhythms on his 1982 album, ``Security'' (on one track, ``Rhythm of
the Heat,'' he used a Ghanian drum section), and the same year
helped form the WOMAD (World of Music Arts and Dance) festival,
gathering bands from more than 60 countries.
   Like the Rolling Stones, who went out of their way to praise the
blues musicians who influenced their records, Gabriel wanted to
find a large audience for these exciting sounds.
   ``Grooves for me are physical things,'' explained the
39-year-old Gabriel, in New York recently to promote the release of
four records on the new RealWorld label. ``They make me feel good.
A bad disco groove, of which there's an awful lot, doesn't make me
want to dance.
   ``Some of the grooves we now take as commonplace rock have come
from Africa and Latin America. They travel across the seas and
become slightly different. I think quite often, white artists don't
quite get it right, and we end up coming out with a form which is
new.''
   The records just issued are ``Passion Sources,'' music from the
Middle East and Africa that Gabriel heard while putting together
the soundtrack for ``The Last Temptation of Christ'';
``Shahen-Shah'' by Pakistan's Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, one of the
foremost singers of the devotional music called ``Qawwali''; ``La
Explosion Del Memento'' by Orquestra Reve; and Tabu Ley's ``Babeti
Soukous.''
   ``We've tried to look for performers who have a lot of soul,''
Gabriel said. ``I think they have strong traditions in their own
countries, it's sometime unfortunate that it gets all out under a
`World Music' label. You talk to the musicians themselves, and they
say, `What the hell is this world music?' I play my music, whatever
it is.'''
   Gabriel is part world musician, part traveling salesman. He
knows record buyers might never even look at the selections from
the Middle East or Africa without an old friend pointing the way.
So if you happen to think of Peter Gabriel while listening to the
infectious grooves of Tabu Ley, well, at least that's a start.
   ``It's not me I'm selling, but someone else,'' he said. ``It's
saying to people who are interested in my music that if you like my
stuff, there's a chance you would like some of the things that
really turn me on.
   ``But it's not Peter Gabriel's label. It's a label in which I
participate. We have a rule where everyone on our committee has to
like everything that goes out.''
   Lyrics are not included, forcing the listener to turn his or her
attention away from the songs' literal meaning and concentrate
instead on the emotions of the performance. In Qawwali, for
instance, words are chanted over and over to a simple rhythm,
giving them a hypnotic, mantra-like effect.
   ``There are ways which you get into a framework where everything
you hear is music, which is probably a nice place to be,'' he said.
``You can really hear the emotion and humanity. So many
intrumentalists are desperately trying to speak with their
instruments, are trying to run the gamut of human emotions. ``You
try to listen to their soul and the feeling that comes out of it.
Some of these wonderful singers from all around the world are just
capable of getting the hairs up in the back of my neck: That's what
I look for.''
   Gabriel, of course, has one advantage over the average listener:
He's actually met the people on the records. Not all the local
musicians, however, were impressed by the presence of a world
famous rock star.
   ``Half knew who I was, half had no idea. One of the Qawwali
groups assumed I was a guy who worked around the studio and didn't
know I was a musician. When they found out I could play, they were
a little bit curious.''
   For Gabriel this music suits his political ideals as well.
Regional tensions, he discovered, can crumble under the power of a
universal language.
   One of the best evenings he had was when he was improvising with
a Pakistani singer and sitar player Ravi Shankar, who's from India.
Shankar played double violin. ``India and Pakistan don't normally
work together and probably wouldn't have in other situations, but
they really got turned on,'' said Gabriel.
   ``I was contributing, but in a subsidiary role. Now I'm going to
do an album with the two of them. They started out not hostile, but
suspicious of each other. By the end of it, they were in love, all
in the space of 40 minutes.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Her Life Is Best Expressed Through Writing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Gordon is an author, and a fairly popular
one, too. But her mother wished she had taken a more secure job,
such as stenography.
   Other family members agreed. The author can still remember her
cousin, a nun, remarking how much she disliked her books. Even her
beloved uncle criticized her work, calling it dirty. It's never
stopped her, though.
   If Gordon had never produced a single novel, she'd still write,
perhaps keep a journal or diary, or make notes to herself if
necessary. She wouldn't feel well otherwise; it's how she best
expresses herself.
   Growing up in an Irish household uncomfortable with verbal
communiation, writing was the only way she could imagine life
outside her unhappy family.
   Her novels, ``Final Payments,'' ``Men and Angels'' and the new
``The Other Side'' ($19.95, Viking) are printed confessions,
attempts at saying the unsayable, penetrations of characters who
conceal their emotions.
   ``Irish culture does not value emotional display,'' the author
said in a interview. ``So it certainly doesn't value emotional
articulateness. It values stoicism, it values silence and it values
keeping things to yourself.
   ``I know that inarticulate people have very rich inner lives;
they just don't have the language for it. Some people who are
educated or upper-middle-class assume that if you control language
or own language, that means you have a finer inner life. But you
can speak emotionally and not be revealing any true emotions.''
   The imminent death of Ellen McNamara, in her 90s, brings
together four generations in ``The Other Side.'' But this family
seems only to share unhappiness. Infidelities, casual cruelty and
emotional instability have made the McNamaras incapable of
supporting each other, even at this time.
   ``I wouldn't know what to write about a good family,'' Gordon
said. ``They don't interest me as a writing problem. What are you
going to say? `They all got together, somebody took the leg of the
chicken, somebody took the breast and somebody got the wing?' Who
cares?''
   But she can't resist a streak of creeping optimism. There's
hope. From Dan and Camille, two of the McNamara grandchildren who
seek love outside their unhappy marraiges, and Darci, Dan's playful
daughter.
   ``I have a lot of faith in Darci. She's got juice and she's got
pizzaz. Life is probably not going to be as wonderful and glorious
as she thinks it is, but she's got life, she's got life force,''
the author said.
   ``I think what happens to you as a child, a young child, is
tremendously important. I think feeling approved of, feeling loved,
feeling safe, is something that can't be replaced. If you don't
have that, I think you're really crippled. It's as if you had to
learn to walk again as an adult.''
   Gordon's characters are weighted down by guilt, a belief that
all earthly pleasure is undeserved, an exaggerated sense of duty.
   In ``Final Payments,'' a young woman shuts herself off from the
outside world for years to nurse her sick father. The housekeeper
in ``Men and Angels'' takes it upon herself to ``save'' her boss
from the sins of humanity.
   Obligation drives Vincent McNamara, Ellen's husband, to leave
the nursing home where he had finally found happiness to fulfill a
long-forgotten promise to be at his wife's side when she dies.
   ``The question of what do you owe people and what you allow for
yourself is very vexing, and I think the Irish are very
idealistic,'' Gordon said. ``They love the possibility of martyrdom
looming somewhere in the future.
   ``They love the idea of a heroic goal that you can devote your
life to. I think it's shaped their political life and it's shaped
their literature.''
   Gordon, a native of Long Island, wrote poetry until age 25 and
then started on ``Final Payments,'' which came out in 1978. She
takes her characters through sickness and health, faith and
despair, sex and religion. Vulnerability, the dependance on
uncontrollable forces, fascinates Gordon, and terrorizes her as
well.
   The uncomplicated joy of Darci is shadowed by Ellen, a once
formidable woman reduced to desperate howls of pain.
   ``One of the terrible things about aging is the way that you
lived does not matter nearly so much as the way you're going to
die,'' she said. ``You can live a really rich, noble life and die
like a jibbering animal. You can live like a total jerk and have a
nothing life, but have a rather beautiful, peaceful death.''
   Words beaten into sound, that's what happens to Ellen as she
nears death. Gordon's characters struggle between language and
emotion, and for most of their lives, language wins. But in the
end, emotion resurfaces. As a writer, Gordon tries to weave them
together.
   ``The rhythm of words and the physical existence of words is
very important to me. I write very physically. To get the intensity
of emotional experience into intensely connected language is a
very, very big goal.
   ``I think there's always a problem with language. What does
langauge actually reveal? The distance between what we want to say
and what we are able to say is tragically great.''

   You start with the name: the Kentucky
Headhunters.
   Images of barefoot, spear-carrying ruffians in loincloth.
   ``It makes people think we're wild, naked hillbillies,'' says
Richard Young, a member of the five-member band from Glasgow, Ky.,
whose music is as intriguing as their name. The five are a newly
signed recording group who play country, rock 'n' roll, bluegrass,
blues and jazz.
   ``We offer a blend of Merle Haggard, Bill Monroe and Led
Zeppelin,'' says Doug Phelps, whose brother, Ricky Lee, also plays
in the group.
   ``Basically what we're doing is taking bluegrass music and
making it jazzy,'' Young says. ``John Lennon has done it and all
those people over there. They would take a bluegrass song and make
it up-tempo.''
   Now about the name.
   The group, nicknamed ``the Heads,'' took the name from a music
term believed to have originated from the blues great Muddy Waters.
The term ``headhunters'' apparently came about when Waters' band
displaced local, less proficient groups as Waters' band toured the
country.
   The proud Kentuckians added their state to the term and their
memorable name was born.
   ``This is the first thing that catches everybody's attention,''
Ricky Lee Phelps says.
   Says Young: ``I called one guy at a radio station and he said he
opened our record just because of the name. He said it sounded like
something out of National Geographic.''
   Adds group member Greg Martin with a chuckle: ``We've got
everybody scared to death. They think, `Headhunters!'''
   The group, whose members are in their late 20s to mid-30s, has
been together four years. Their first Mercury-Polygram album is
``Pickin' on Nashville'' and the first single released from the LP
is ``Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine.''
   The band consists of four guitars and drums and occasionally an
harmonica.
   ``It's aggressive music, but it's a bunch of hillbillies playing
it,'' Ricky Lee Phelps says.
   Drummer Fred Young, Richard's brother, says: ``We all grew up
using the outhouse.''
   ``We've all run out of toilet paper out there,'' Richard adds.
   The band plays a mixture of music ranging from Jimi Hendrix's
``Wait 'til Tomorrow,'' to Cream's ``Crossroads,'' and country
standards such as ``Oh Lonesome Me'' and ``Wildwood Flower.'' They
close their performances by saluting their home state with ``My Old
Kentucky Home.''
   Ricky Lee Phelps adds an entertaining touch to their
performances by pulling an array of props out of a trunk on stage.
   ``It's full of toys,'' he says. ``I've got water guns in there
and I wet people down. I pull out a phone and talk to Elvis. I've
got some magic tricks and I throw out cheap novelties to the
crowd.''
   He also juggles bowling pins. ``Four is the most I can do, and
three is plenty.''
   Fred Young often plays drums shirtless, borrowing the idea from
other drummers he's seen. It also saves time when he's through
playing.
   ``I've been playing this way all my life. It gets hot back there
and you don't want to jump in the shower afterwards with your
clothes on.''
   Their instruments are as unpretentious as the musicians playing
them. They've disdained state-of-the-art guitars and drums for
instruments that are 20 years old and older.
   ``These drums are a complete different sound,'' Fred Young says
about his set, which has ``Metcalfe County High School'' proudly
printed on them. ``I don't ever remember tuning them.''
   Before the Phelps brothers joined the group, the band was known
as Itchy Brothers. This name was borrowed from the King Leonardo
cartoon show in which Itchy was King Leonardo's evil brother.
   ``It was a good name,'' Richard Young says. ``We thought about
keeping it. The Kentucky Headhunters are an extension of it.''

<HEAD>Congress Rethinking How Government Tallies Red Ink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bookkeeping issue that seemingly only an
accountant could love is commanding keen interest on Capitol Hill.
The debate on how to tally the budget deficit could have big
implications for Social Security.
   The deficit by law is defined as the difference between federal
income and spending, including the billions earned and spent for
Social Security benefits. So as the Social Security trust funds
build big reserves to help pay for baby boomers' retirement in the
next century, the official deficit tally is held down by payroll
and employer taxes earmarked for Social Security benefits.
   Democrats and Republicans both are increasingly supporting
taking Social Security's money-making trust funds out of the
deficit equation, claiming that the current system masks the extent
of the rest of the government's red ink.
   In fiscal 1988, for example, the government's $155 billion
deficit would have been $194 billion if Social Security were
excluded. In 1989, the official deficit fell to $152 billion;
without Social Security, it was $204.5 billion.
   ``We are playing a game with the way we report the budget
deficit each year,'' Sen. John Heinz told colleagues in October.
``It seems to me it is time to 'fess up to what we are doing and do
something about it.''
   Heinz, R-Pa., held up action on an urgent debt bill until
congressional leaders agreed to tackle the deficit-definition issue
early next year.
   Those who favor removing Social Security from the equation say
the unrealistically rosy budget picture removes pressure to cut the
deficit, and that the move would help protect the trust fund
reserves.
   ``What we're trying to do is stop the looting of that trust
fund, and get truth in budgeting,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C.
   ``If we can save our Social Security trust fund surpluses,
rather than spending them on government consumption as we do
presently, we can more than double our net national savings rate,''
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   Critics maintain that removing Social Security from the equation
would excuse a big chunk of the budget _ about 20 percent of
federal spending _ from making more contributions toward reducing
the deficit. They also say that once trust funds no longer are
counted, politicians might spend the reserves on pet projects or
bigger benefits for today's retirees, at the expense of tomorrow's.
   ``Every day, I and other members of the Ways and Means Committee
answer mail asking for benefit expansions by stating that we cannot
further improve benefits because of the budget deficit,'' Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., told a House panel recently. ``This argument
will be eliminated when Social Security becomes completely
off-budget.''
   Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget
Office, shares that concern. ``It certainly would be harder to fend
off proposals to raise benefits or cut payroll taxes without the
discipline of deficit reduction,'' Reischauer told lawmakers.
   For example, he said, Congress might have been unable to resist
recent efforts to boost payments to ``notch babies'' _ Americans
born in 1917 through 1921 _ who get lower benefits due to a change
in the method of calculation.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King calls the
deficit-definition debate ``one of the most specious discussions
you're ever going to find in government'' since it shifts numbers
on paper without altering spending.
   Yet she is wary of tinkering with the system. ``I have a real
concern if taking it off-budget means making it more vulnerable. To
pull it out, there have got to be some safeguards built around that
trust fund to ensure that nobody can raid it.''
   Rostenkowski believes Social Security is better off left as it
is, but he has introduced legislation to help protect the trust
funds if they are removed from the deficit calculations. Under the
bill, a House member could object to any legislation that increased
Social Security benefits without providing for a corresponding
increase in revenues. Such an objection could be overruled only by
a majority vote in the House Rules Committee or by 60 votes in the
Senate.
   Without such protections, Rostenkowski said, Congress may not
have ``the political courage to say `no' to those proposals which
would increase benefits immediately but at the same time further
jeopardize our children's benefits.''
   Mrs. King called Rostenkowski's bill a step ``in the right
direction,'' but said it wasn't strong enough to adequately protect
the trust funds.
   Accompanying the deficit-definition debate is the broader
question of whether Social Security should continue stockpiling
money now to meet the big retirement demands of the baby boom
generation.
   The General Accounting Office early in 1989 said Congress should
consider rolling back payroll tax increases because the Social
Security reserves are being used ``to finance the current
operations of the government and are masking the size of the
on-budget deficit.''
   Returning Social Security to a ``pay-as-you-go'' system would
involve reducing payroll taxes in the 1990s and raising them above
scheduled levels in the next century, when benefit costs will rise
as the baby boomers retire.
   ``This would eliminate the illusory buildup of reserves that now
represents little more than a mechanism for using the payroll tax
to finance the general operations of government,'' the GAO said.

   Youth might be wasted on the young, but education isn't.
   Inspired by the youth hosteling movement in Europe, a
Boston-based study-travel program called Elderhostel is booming. It
offers a nearly overwhelming range of inexpensive courses for
seniors at sites around the world.
   ``It gives me a chance to meet a bunch of people who I've never
met before, who all have great things to contribute,'' said Don
Stangel, 71, of Rockport, Mass., who has attended Elderhostel
programs since 1977. ``It gives me a terrific break from my normal
routine. I wouldn't be without it.''
   ``We thoroughly enjoy it,'' said Paul Robb, 82, of Muncie, Ind.,
who with his wife, Catherine, has attended nine Elderhostel
courses, both in the United States and abroad. They've signed up
for two more courses in 1990.
   Seniors can study marine life in Polynesia, culture in Japan,
genealogy in London, the Byzantine civilization in Turkey, or other
topics at more than 100 overseas locations. Or history, dance,
theater, literature, biology, ecology, sports and other subjects at
more than 1,200 sites in the United States and Canada. Courses are
offered in all 50 states and all Canadian provinces.
   In fact, the range of programs can be daunting. The latest
catalog is 144 pages, with a 40-page supplement, and reads like a
good novel.
   ``It's a mistake to think of older adults as one market,'' said
Mike Zoob, vice president of Elderhostel. ``We deliberately have an
enormous variety of programs. Some are more rugged _ like hiking in
the Himalayas. I'd like that, but it's not everyone's cup of tea.''
   ``A lot of people go where their children or grandchildren are,
or plan a vacation, and pop in an Elderhostel program along the
way,'' said spokeswoman Karyn Franzen.
   Elderhostel began in 1975, with 220 seniors taking courses at
five colleges and universities in New Hampshire. Its popularity has
soared since. In 1989, 197,000 people took part at more than 1,400
locations in 42 countries.
   U.S. and Canadian courses often begin on a Sunday afternoon and
end the following Saturday morning, while overseas programs run two
to three weeks.
   ``Some people go Elderhosteling across the country, taking five,
six, seven, even thirteen courses in a row, '' Zoob said.
   Prices for domestic programs range from $230 to $275 per person,
slightly more in Canada and Hawaii, double in Alaska. That includes
six nights' lodging, five days of courses, all meals and a variety
of extra-curricular activities.
   Elderhostel also sponsors some ``hostelships,'' financial
assistance which enables the very poor to attend nearby programs.
   Programs are limited to those 60 and older, but seniors can be
accompanied by someone as young as 50.
   Accommodations are spartan, often consisting of two twin beds in
a college dormitory, with bathrooms down the hall. Single rooms are
sometimes available for an extra charge.
   The Elderhostel courses are not for credit, have no grades or
exams, and except for intensive courses, no homework. The courses
are designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of previous
education.
   ``Just do it _ don't let anything stop you,'' Stangel said.
``You don't have to have a college education, even though most of
the programs are held at colleges. It's the experiences in your
life that make you interesting.''
   Weather sometimes affects programs, much as it does other travel
plans, but participants give Elderhostel high marks for ingenuity.
   ``It poured rain all week, and we were supposed to be hiking
through the woods,'' said Joanne Bentley, 61, of Upper Nyack, N.Y.,
who attended a program in the Catskill Mountains. ``But they were
very imaginative. They brought in experts on acid rain, and birds,
and whales.
   ``They really coped awfully well on the spur of the moment.''
   Other Elderhostel travelers had the chance to see history being
made on their latest trip to China.
   Marjorie Edwards of La Crascenta, Calif., spent the evening of
June 3 in Tienanmen Square in Beijing. ``It was a fascinating, but
very sad, experience for us to see the marvelous progress China has
made in the past nine years, and then, in one night, see a turn of
events that could spell disaster for continuing progress,'' she
wrote to Elderhostel.
   Despite a rapid change in travel plans as Elderhostel students
returned home early, some were still enthusiastic about the Chinese
trip.
   ``I would like to encourage you to keep this program going,''
wrote Michael Bresser of Sun City, Ariz. ``At no time did we feel
threatened; we were always surrounded by concern for our well-being.
   ``The Chinese are a great people and I'm convinced that we need
to learn from them as much as they need to learn from us.''

   The only thing wrong with retirement,
Gerald Giles says, is he can't get a day off.
   Giles, 68, of West Des Moines, retired as a chemical engineer
seven years ago. As a volunteer for the Service Corps of Retired
Executives, he spends 10 hours a week advising small businesses on
marketing and sales techniques. He also is a speaker for Gideons
International, which distributes Bibles.
   Wes Kitchell, who retired as an insurance consultant in 1981,
coordinates monthly business seminars for SCORE. He has been a
trustee for the Masons for three years and visits once a week with
patients at Mercy Hospital's Heritage Program for Seniors.
   ``Some people think I'm driven, but I just get a big kick out of
life,'' said Kitchell, 74, of Des Moines.
   Kitchell and Giles may be getting more than just a kick out of
life.
   ``We think differently as we get older, in a slower manner, and
there is some memory loss which is a perfectly normal finding,''
said Dr. Robert Bender, of the Mercy Hospital Geriatric Clinic.
``But there is some evidence that staying mentally active may
actually help preserve brain function.''
   Mental lethargy and its effects on good health can be seen most
easily in nursing home patients, said Dr. Roy Overton, another
gerontologist at Mercy.
   ``In nursing home patients, we see these pseudo dementias that
aren't real dementias at all. You walk into a room and see a
patient staring at the ceiling or the floor. And you think they've
lost their minds but they haven't. They're truly depressed,'' said
Overton.
   Bender tells his patients to write down their talents and use
them. ``Using one's talents is the epitome of mental activity which
may prevent or slow down the changes in the aging brain.
   ``Albert Einstein did active research until the week before he
died in his 70s. That shows you that we always have the capacity to
learn more.''
   Gwen Rusk, 79, of Des Moines, worked as an insurance secretary
for 14 years until retirement in 1980. ``Now, I stay home as a last
resort,'' said Rusk, who volunteers 15 to 20 hours a week at the
Retired Senior Volunteer Program. Her rule is not to spend more
time playing bridge than doing volunteer work.
   RSVP, a United Way program begun in 1972, matches volunteers
with jobs in the community. Program director Barb Wacker said its
1,100 volunteers donated 162,000 hours in fiscal 1988-89.
   Rusk and other retirees at a senior housing building make
teaching aids for children in the Head Start program. They fashion
balls out of fabric scraps and nylon stockings and put together
jump ropes by connecting red plastic loops.
   ``It isn't that I don't like my own company, but actually it can
get very stale if you're not out in the world to see what's
happening. That's how you make friends to ensure you have friends
when you become an old lady,'' Rusk said.
   Miriam Cline, 68, a member of the Urbandale City Council, is on
an RSVP committee that gives advice on planning for retirement. She
was co-coordinator of the Iowa Peace Ribbon Project in 1984 and
visited Nicaragua in 1986 for the International Women's Day and to
learn about problems facing women there.
   Cline said she has retired at least six times, but can't make it
stick. She stays involved ``to feel like I'm worth something, have
something to offer and have a place in this world.''
   Virginia Yaeger, 65, of Des Moines, raised two children after
her divorce by working as a dental assistant. At age 60, she was
forced out of her job when her boss retired. ``I tried to find work
with another dentist but they all wanted to hire younger dental
assistants,'' Yaeger said.
   She called the Retired Iowans Employment Program at the state
Department of Elder Affairs, which placed 2,000 senior citizens in
paying jobs last year. It helped her get a job as a receptionist at
Crossroads, a seniors program.
   ``I learned to use one of these fancy memory typewriters. I
learned how to get around that pretty well,'' she said. ``If you
stay home you become a couch potato with your soap operas and you
just don't think like you did before.
   ``I'll work as long as my health holds out.''

<HEAD>Anthology Publishes Work by Older Writers</HEAD>

   Ah, the stories they can tell. About a
man obsessed with the education of his children. Or a love story
with Venice as a backdrop. Or building a homestead in the early
1900s.
   ``A lot of us do memory pieces and if they're not entirely
memory we might write fiction based on things we've known,'' said
writer Garnet Garoni, 71, of Las Cruces. ``There isn't a very big
market for that type of story, but it's really fun to write.''
   Not a big market, maybe, but Mrs. Garoni and other older New
Mexicans have found an outlet in Serape, an annual anthology of
poetry and short stories by senior citizens. Published by Nightjar
Press at New Mexico State University, Serape first appeared on New
Mexico bookshelves in 1983, the result of a creative writing class
at a Las Cruces senior center.
   Kevin McIlvoy, an associate professor of English at New Mexico
State, isn't proud that he was surprised at the caliber of writing
he found among students at Munson Senior Citizen's Center. But his
thinking took a quick, sharp turn.
   ``I thought, `Gee, this is powerful writing,''' says McIlvoy,
who still teaches the weekly class. ``It's so strong, so powerful
and so informed by those years of experience that I really wanted
it to be brought to readers.''
   Serape's early issues contained work by class members, but more
recent editions have been open to older writers throughout the
state. Some 30 pieces of work by 15 authors _ all of them 55 or
older _ appear in the sixth edition of ``Serape,'' scheduled for
release this month.
   It will be the fourth time Mrs. Garoni's work has been published
in ``Serape.'' ``Miracles Do Happen,'' a short, fictional story
about a girl who leaves a Wisconsin town for the bright lights of
Chicago.
   ``Really one of my own thoughts about Serape is what we're doing
is giving exposure to people whose names are not already
recognizable, but who are certainly doing important work,'' McIlvoy
said.
   He and editors Kathryn Byrd and Bill Pearson, retirees whose
work has appeared in Serape, waded through 64 manuscripts of about
25 pages each before making the wrenching final selections for the
1989 edition.
   ``We get quite a massive pile of material,'' McIlvoy said. The
pile could become even more massive if he is able to expand the
anthology to include older writers from throughout the Southwest.
McIlvoy proposed the idea to New Mexico State officials while also
telling them the expansion would require higher production
standards and more pages _ and therefore more funding.
   Serape, which sells for $6 and can be purchased at bookstores
around the state or from New Mexico State, now is funded mainly
through sales and by the university, with 10 percent coming from
donors and patrons.
   ``Teaching at the Munson Center, as I have done for the last six
years, and editing this anthology are for me the most important,
stimulating things that I do,'' McIlvoy said. ``I work with
extremely talented young writers here at the university, but the
old cliche applies _ there's no replacing experience.''

<HEAD>Maker of Ping Golf Clubs Learns Life's Big Lessons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karsten Solheim _ millionaire, engineer and golf
club designer _ can trace his business philosophy to the years
during the Depression when he ran a shoe repair shop because he
couldn't afford to stay in college.
   When one of his two competitors on a Seattle street corner
reduced the price of heels to 15 cents, Solheim followed suit.
   ``The first customer that came in asked me, `Is that as good as
it used to be?' Of course, I had to say yes. When the next two
customers asked the same question, I decided most people were more
interested in quality than price. I took my sign down and resumed
charging 35 cents for heels.''
   That observation was reinforced when he noticed that people
would generally choose from the most expensive pile of leather on
the counter.
   ``Again I found most people were more interested in quality than
in price. That's stuck with me all my life,'' said Solheim, 77.
   Indeed, golfers are willing to pay about one-third more for his
Ping custom-fitted putters and irons _ ``ping'' was the sound the
first putters made. They were used by more than 200 pros in 1989
and netted $80 million in sales.
   Some of Solheim's other lessons came from his father, a
shoemaker who immigrated with his family from Norway. From him,
Solheim learned hard work and ``a skill I wouldn't have had
otherwise _ how to use my hands.
   ``So when I came to making my clubs it was second nature.''
   It also was the way he made ends meet before the approach of
World War II enabled him to return to the University of Washington.
By 1945, he was a flight research engineer; by 1951, a project
engineer on the Atlas missile; and by 1953 he began a long
association with General Electric as an engineer.
   It was around then he decided he could afford to take up golf.
He was terrible. At first he blamed himself, but golf would never
be the same after he concluded that the clubs were the problem and
set out to design better ones.
   The earliest Ping putters were good for a laugh because the
looked like a ``hot dog on the end of a stick.'' The design concept
came from tennis rackets, which have the weight on the rim while
the strings give the power.
   A putter based on that theory would let a golfer miss a little
and still hit straight, Solheim concluded. ``I made them ugly on
purpose so they'd be accepted for their worth, not appearance.''
   He improved his game until he carried a five handicap _
something most golfers would like. It's now 18, but an eye problem
keeps him off the links.
   ``When he was starting, he used to sit around the practice green
with a bunch of putters, hoping some of the pros would try them,''
said Bob Goalby, the 1968 Masters champion. ``One day he had holes
in his shoes. And somebody asked me, `Who's that guy over there
with those weird putters and holes in his shoes? What's he doing
here? Did you every see anything worse than that?'
   ``But he never became discouraged or angry. He'd listen to what
guys would say after trying his putters, take their criticism to
heart, go back and change them, come back the next day or next
tournament and say, `What do you think of this one now?' And guys
started saying, `Hey, Karsten, let me try that one.' But he sure
took some heat at first.''
   From building clubs in his garage, Solheim's privately held
Karsten Manufacturing Co. has grown to employ 1,700 people in 22
buildings covering several blocks. He received an ``E'' award
during the Reagan administration for increasing trade with foreign
companies _ tiny flags of 77 countries where Ping clubs are sold
are displayed in the headquarters lobby.
   In the early days Solheim would test the wind drag of a club's
swing by holding various models out the window of his car while
traveling at high speed. Now he has a sophisticated machine to
measure drag, and other equipment is so state-of-the-art that plant
tours are limited and security tight.
   ``I think Karsten is a genius as far as making golf clubs and
equipment,'' said Quinton Gray, who has used Pings since 1967. When
the factory was making a new set for him in April he was given a
tour.
   ``The quality control is the best I've ever seen. But what
impressed me more than anything was you could go anywhere in the
facility and you could sit down on the floor and have your lunch,
it was that clean. And all the employees seemed happy. Everyone was
very, very friendly and accommodating,'' Gray said.
   Life is teaching Solheim a new lesson, however.
   After more than a million sets of Ping Eye2 irons were sold, the
U.S. Golf Association has banned them in the 13 USGA championships
starting Jan. 1 and in practically all play beginning in 1996. The
Professional Golfers Association is also questioning the clubs, but
is banning all similar clubs, not just Pings.
   The organizations say the shape of the grooves _ square or
`U'-shaped instead of a `V' _ and their spacing give stronger
golfers an unfair advantage in backspin _ giving better control to
stop a ball from rolling, for example.
   Solheim in August filed a federal lawsuit against the USGA and
others, alleging slander and violation of antitrust laws, and
seeking an injunction and damages in excess of $100 million.
   ``It'd be easy enough for me to change the clubs, but I have to
think of all those people who've bought them. It wouldn't be fair
to my customers. And I don't want to destroy the performance of the
clubs either,'' he said. ``What the USGA is asking for and what the
rules say are not the same.
   ``The irony is there is a greater difference between dimples on
balls than there is between the clubs. That's where the big
difference is. But they don't have to change anything. Where in the
world will you go and find somebody who wants something that's 95
percent good when they can have it 100 percent?
   ``How could I run a business with that kind of ambition?''

   If Jaguars and diamonds are a little pricey and
store-bought baubles aren't personal enough for those on your list,
gifts fresh from your kitchen in attractive reusable containers
make doubly delightful presents.
   The time, thoughtfulness and care that go into something
hand-made touch us all, and part of the pleasure is looking for
reusable containers. I've found them in all sorts of places.
Import-export stores have pottery, glass, baskets, from all over
the world. A thrift or antique shop may unearth a charming tray or
vintage Mason jars, and local artisans offer one-of-a-kind pieces
for the kitchen and home that will be treasured for years.
   Anything will be happily received, from a cut glass cruet for
your homemade vinegar to a tiny, tiered jewelry box with each
drawer filled with tantalizing two-bite confections.
   When it comes time to stir things up in the kitchen, be sure to
include your grandchildren, or any small children for that matter.
The sights, sounds and smells enliven the creative spirit, and
simple tasks such as helping stuff dates and rolling out cookies
are just the ticket. They can have the fun of making a present for
a teacher or treats for stocking-stuffers.
   Following are some suggestions for your Christmas or Hannukkah
table and for gift-giving. This holiday season we most certainly
want to offer the precious gift of our time to programs in church,
synagogue or school to cook and serve a holiday meal to people
without the warmth and love of home and hearth and family.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: George Bria retired from the AP in 1981 after 40
years that included coverage of World War II from Italy.

<TEXT>
   I count three tools as indispensable in
my garden: the spading fork, the trowel and the pen.
   True, my pen has got an advanced degree now and dresses up as a
computer, wooing me with fancy tricks. But basically, it does the
same work.
   Sure, you can garden without records, but many of us come to
rely on and enjoy the day-by-day jottings that chart our successes
and failures over years.
   On a spring day in Virginia in 1766, 22-year-old Thomas
Jefferson scribbled, ``March 30. Purple hyacinth begins to bloom.''
Thus began a notebook he found time for even during his presidency.
A farmer as well as a gardener, Jefferson was a painstaking
notekeeper. For eight years, he tabulated the earliest and latest
appearance of 37 vegetables on the Washington market.
   Most importantly, a notebook profiles the individual garden,
establishing the right times and places to plant things and
reminding you when to dust or fertilize. Your plot differs from
your neighbor's in soil, moisture, slant of sun, hours of shade.
You may get a killing frost while a garden 50 yards down the road
escapes. You can't steer only by directions on seed packets or in
manuals; they're too generalized.
   By keeping careful notes, I learned the best time to plant
Brussels sprouts. Conventionally, in my area 50 miles north of
Manhattan, you're advised to plant in late July. But my plants
didn't make enough growth then. The middle of June turned out best,
giving me nice sprouts in time to benefit from the hard October
frosts that vastly improve their taste.
   Then, some plant varieties do well in your garden and others
don't. You may be better off staying with your tried-and-true
plants rather than going for the newest hybrids. With dozens of
varieties to track, your notebook keeps a much better record of
trials and errors than you could hope to in your memory.
   Notes, or sketches, also will remind you where you put what
when. Some plants, like the cabbage family, need to be moved around
from year to year to prevent disease.
   Many things go into a gardening diary. Little mystery stories
may unfold. Looking at my 1983 notes, I see my asparagus tips
suddenly developed a chewed look. Slug bait did nothing at all. Nor
was it a strange disease. The culprit _ I caught him at it _ turned
out to be a woodchuck that got over the fence.
   On Oct. 4, 1987, we had the earliest snowfall in my memory,
interesting for my diary because my beans and other tender crops
survived.
   My word processor has tidied up my record-keeping immensely. The
``insert'' and ``delete'' enable me to correct, rewrite and edit as
I go along. At the end of the year, I give the diary a touch-up,
print it and bind it in a notebook.
   If you're a computer buff, you can move up to database
record-keeping, letting you look at your garden from numerous
perspectives. Creating a database is painstaking work and it takes
a while to accumulate a significant amount of data. But eventually
you can ask your computer, for example, what flowers you have grown
that bloom in the shade, what kind of soil they like and when to
plant them. Or how many European lettuces you've grown over the
years. Push a couple keys and the computer will respond with names,
dates, country of origin and anything else you wanted to record
about the lettuce. And it will do it in various formats, giving
you, say, only French lettuces, or slow-bolting ones.
   Big deal, you might say, but you get your answers instantly and
it's fun to do. And it's up to you to create the variety and
penetration of searches.
   If you have a computer but lack the time or patience to build
your own database, you can get ready-made gardening programs that
combine note-keeping with instruction and graphics. You can file
away sketches of your garden as it looked from year to year, thus
helping you to rotate your crops. Your zip code tells the program
what plants are feasible for your area.
   For the non-computer minded, there are special notebooks for the
garden.
   Whether you work with pen or computer, keeping notes, like
digging in the dirt, is hard but brings special rewards.

<HEAD>Board Game Built Around Life in Retirement Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new board game built around real-life
situations from nursing and retirement homes around the country is
designed to help people who work with the elderly solve problems
and be more understanding.
   The Game of Aging Concerns asks participants to discuss how they
would deal with challenges and crises that come up in homes for the
elderly.
   For example, one game card instructs players to role-play a
situation in which an administrator is talking with a group of
residents who are demanding the ouster of an unmarried man and
woman who live together.
   Another card asks the player to discuss how to help an elderly
man whose wife died two years earlier and feels he has nothing left
to live for. A third asks what to do about a 72-year-old man who is
intoxicated when he comes to the dining room and acts belligerant
and disruptive.
   The game was developed for the American Association of Homes for
the Aging by Vicki Schmall, a gerontologist at Oregon State
University who based the game cards on more than 1,000 situations
submitted by retirement housing officials.
   The AAHA decided to produce the game after test groups reported
that it helped stimulate discussions about challenges that arise in
retirement homes, said spokeswoman Deborah Cloud. ``This is kind of
a fun departure from the typical lecture and book-learning
training.''
   Schmall also has developed board games called Sex and Aging and
Families and Aging to help people understand issues related to the
elderly. ``It's a technique that works well in terms of
problem-solving and helping people to step into the shoes of older
adults. It really encourages interaction and getting people to look
at situations from a variety of perspectives.''
   The game is available for $30 plus $3 per game for shipping and
handling from AAHA Publications, American Association of Homes for
the Aging, 1129 20th St. NW, Suite 400, Washington D.C. 20036-3489.

<HEAD>Many Cut Back on Necessities to Handle Money Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than one-fourth of older Americans cut
back on basic necessities such as food, energy or medical care
because of ``money problems,'' according to a government survey of
married couples age 55 and older.
   Energy consumption, including heat and hot water, was the most
frequent cutback, followed closely by food, with medical care
reduced by substantially fewer households, said the report in the
Agriculture Department Family Economic Review. It said 14.5 percent
of households surveyed reduced on one of the three necessities, 6.9
percent cut back on two, and 5.2 percent cut back all three.
   ``Health or safety problems are likely to be a very real
possibility for some households who cut back on food purchases,
heat or hot water, or medical care,'' the report said.
   It also found that 31 percent of older households cut back on
entertainment because of financial strains, suggesting that ``when
older consumers are faced with the need to cut back, discretionary
areas are likely to be cut first.''
   The report was based on an analysis of 2,480 married couples
included in the 1983 Survey of Aging Veterans by the Veterans
Administration. Since then, shelter, energy and medical care have
been significant sources of inflation.
   ``The difficulties that the older consumers were experiencing in
1983 _ and which led to cuts by a substantial proportion of
households in one or more basic consumption areas _ likely have
persisted over time,'' it said.
   In addition, married-couple households generally are better off
economically than older consumers in general.

   Unemployment climbed to a 10-month high of 5.4
percent in November and manufacturing payrolls shrank for the
eighth consecutive month, the government said.
   The increase in the civilian jobless rate from 5.3 percent came
despite the addition of 210,000 non-farm jobs last month.
   The new non-farm jobs reported Friday by the Labor Department
was in itself a moderately strong number, but the government also
sharply cut its job growth figures for October from 233,000 to

   The Bush administration is considering
significant relaxation of a U.S. ban on high technology exports to
Eastern Europe, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher says.
   Mosbacher indicated Hungary and Poland could be two of the main
beneficiaries of such a change. He said in a television interview
the two countries were discussing with U.S. officials how to
prevent the transfer of militarily strategic items to neighboring
Communist-bloc countries.
   A change in U.S. restrictions would be designed to encourage the
political liberalization in Eastern Europe and to deal with heavy
pressure from U.S. allies seeking an easing of export controls to
the Soviet bloc.

<HEAD>Boeing Helicopters, Union Reach Agreement on New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Helicopters and 3,000 union members
have reached agreement on a three-year contract that parallels one
that ended a 48-day strike by Machinists at parent Boeing Co.
   The agreement is retroactive to Oct. 5, when the old contract
would have expired without a day-to-day extension.
   A Boeing Helicopters announcement did not provide results of the
ratification vote Sunday. United Aerospace Workers' Local 1069
officials could not be reached for comment.
   The new Boeing Helicopters contract parallels the package
accepted three weeks ago by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   The contract includes a three-year series of wage increases,
lump sum payments and quarterly cost-of-living adjustments, the
company said.
   The wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent are
retroactive to Oct. 5. Three lump sum payments of 10 percent, 5
percent and 4 percent are to be paid on Dec. 15 of 1989, 1990 and
1991.
   Boeing Helicopters, based in Ridley Township outside
Philadelphia, produces military rotocraft, including the tilt-rotor
V-22 Osprey transport.
   Earlier this month, Defense Department Secretary Dick Cheney
canceled the V-22 production contracts with Boeing Helicopters and
Bell Helicopter-Textron of Fort Worth, Texas.
   The Marines want to use the V-22 to shuttle troops from ship to
shore in amphibious operations. The canceled contract applies only
to production money appropriated for the fiscal year 1989, which
ended in September.
   Boeing and Bell are building six V-22 prototypes, and research
and development contracts will continue, Boeing said.

   A proposed deal that would give a Soviet
research institute an equity stake in a U.S. biotechnology company
could lead to the commercialization of Soviet scientific advances,
experts said.
   ``It comes in the context of a new Soviet policy to integrate
with the world economy, so it could be the beginning of a trend,''
said Paul Surovell, editor of a newsletter that monitors Soviet
trade. He noted that American companies already are taking equity
in Soviet companies.
   Under the plan, the Institute of Protein Research outside Moscow
will swap protein synthesis technology for a 5 percent to 20
percent ownership stake in Transgene Inc., a Silicon Valley
start-up specializing in protein synthesis.
   The plan still needs approval by the U.S. and Soviet governments.
   The Soviets have developed a new way to create proteins like
insulin that cut the development time from weeks to days or even
hours.
   Kenneth Lee, national director of the biotechnology practice for
the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, said the deal would be the first
of its kind.
   ``We have found a way to collaborate without any cash,'' he said.
   Pietro Vainio, a venture capitalist who helped negotiate for
Transgene, said he hoped the deal would ``form one model for how
U.S. venture companies can invest in and commercialize promising
new technology in the Soviet Union.''
   If the deal is approved, Transgene will be allowed to
commercialize the technology and sell it to all but Eastern
European countries. The technology would be transferred back to the
Soviet institute for sale in those countries.
   The U.S. Commerce Department and the Treasury Department are
expected to become involved in the approval process because the
joint venture would involve a transfer of technology in both
directions.

   The dollar fell today against all major foreign
currencies, except the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar in
light overseas trading.
   Gold prices rose in quiet trading.
   Traders said fundamentals have changed little from last week
with the West German mark still strong against all currencies.
   Trading will remain uneventful, dealers predicted, as the market
winds down before the Christmas holiday season.
   ``I don't think much will happen any more before Christmas,
although the trend line shows it (the dollar) could move a little
bit lower,'' said a trader at a large Frankfurt bank.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose even though traders said the Bank of
Japan sold dollars to check the American currency's rise. The Bank
of Japan, the nation's central bank, does not comment on its market
activities.
   The dollar rose 0.38 yen in Tokyo to a closing 144.65 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 144.57 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7695 West German marks, down from 1.7720;
1.5965 Swiss francs, down from 1.5985; 6.0455 French francs, down
from 6.0565; 1.9962 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0000; 1,305.50
Italian lire, down from 1,306.50; and 1.1615 Canadian dollars,
unchanged.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5835 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5793 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $412.90 a troy ounce, up
from $411.55 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $414.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $413.90, up from $409.25 bid late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 11 cents to close at a bid $412.26.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.66 a troy ounce, up

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen for
the seventh consecutive trading day today and prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange also rose slightly.
   The dollar closed at 144.65, up 0.38 yen from its 144.27 yen
close on Friday. It opened at 144.50 yen and ranged between 144.45
yen and 144.73 yen. The U.S. currency now has climbed 1.75 yen in
seven trading days.
   Its higher opening resulted from its surge last week in New
York, where it closed at 144.25 on Friday, and from tightened
demand for a large number of export contracts usually due for
settlement on Mondays, dealers said.
   But the Bank of Japan was believed to have stepped into the
market several times, selling dollars to keep the U.S. currency
within a narrow range, said Kaneo Ogino of Goldman Sachs in Tokyo.
The central bank does not comment on its exchange market activities.
   Ogino said market activity was likely to trail off toward the
end of the month, with dealers unwilling to take large positions
before the new year.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues gained 28.61 points, or 0.08 percent, closing at
37,752.67. On Friday, the Nikkei fell 134.05 points after closing
at record highs on 11 of the preceding 12 trading days.
   Trading started slowly today as investors waited to see the
market's performance after its strong advances last week, traders
said.
   After opening lower, the Nikkei rebounded toward the end of the
morning session on renewed buying of resource-related and
incentive-backed issues, dealers said.
   The large amount of funds flowing into the market from
institutional and corporate investors prevented a major decline
from profit-taking, they said.
   Investors are watching currency markets carefully out of concern
that a renewed surge of the dollar against the yen could provoke an
interest rate hike, said Julian Jones of W.I. Carr's equity sales.
   Volume was estimated at 700 million shares, down from an
estimated 1 billion shares Friday.

   ``Sparky'' may be the trendy new house pet
of the '90s.
   He won't bite the mailman or howl at the moon. He's bigger than
a cat but smaller than a Doberman.
   He doesn't shed, smell or claw the furniture, and prefers a tidy
litterbox to the living room rug. He'll walk on a leash, swim,
fetch or just sit and watch TV.
   And the worst thing you can say about him? Well, he's a pig. A
Vietnamese potbellied pig.
   These pygmy porkers have become popular pets in the last couple
of years, despite hefty prices, ranging from about $1,500 for a
neutered male to $35,000 for a pregnant female.
   Pig owners boast their pets learn quickly and have sunny
dispositions. They don't get really big _ full-grown, they weigh
between 20 and 150 pounds (as compared to hogs, which can weigh
half a ton). But right now, just about the only way to acquire a
Vietnamese potbelly is to get plugged into the nationwide breeders
network.
   That's where Sparky's owner, Kris Bryant, comes in.
   Bryant breeds and sells Vietnamese potbellied pigs through her
company, Paradise Pigs, and keeps her customers updated on pig care
and feeding through a homey newsletter.
   (From a recent issue: ``It has been brought to my attention that
some of you are unsure of how much to feed your piggies, and some
are even letting them `pig out' (pun intended).'')
   Bryant is also about to launch Pet Pig Update, which she bills
as ``the first magazine devoted to miniature pet pigs!'' And she
was recently elected to the board of the newly formed North
American Potbellied Pig Association, with headquarters in Columbia,
Mo.
   As one of a handful of Vietnamese potbellied pig breeders,
Bryant is particularly concerned about keeping the animals'
bloodlines pure while not inbreeding them. Virtually all the
Vietnamese potbellies in the United States are descended from a
group of 18 brought in through Canada in 1983 by Keith Connell.
   There are several pig registries nationwide which certify how
closely related the animals are to the original group. But Bryant
says some breeders _ anxious to cash in on the growing market _
cross their Vietnamese potbellies with other strains. The resulting
pigs are not as small or good-tempered or healthy as the real
thing, she says.
   Bryant got interested in the pint-sized pigs by accident; she
had been trying to get a skunk to keep her cat company and applied
for several exotic animal permits.
   ``Once I got all the permits, I was on mailing lists and I
started getting ads for zebras and giraffes and things,'' she said
in a recent interview. ``I just was watching the pigs in those
trade magazines. And I really liked the idea because, well, pigs
just make really great pets but they're also a pet that anybody can
have. Most of the pets that are unusual you can't have unless you
have a farm. The pigs you can have in an apartment.''
   Bryant speaks from experience. Until recently, she had been
breeding pigs in a two-bedroom condo in suburban Rockville, and at
one point had 23 of them. But she and her husband, Jeb, are moving
to Durango, Colo., where they will raise pigs and other exotic
animals on a farm. Their breeding pigs are already there.
   In the meantime, the Bryants and Sparky are sharing quarters
with a ferret, a tabby cat, a tank of goldfish in the house and,
oddly, a bathtub filled with more fish outside on the balcony.
   During a visit, 4-month-old Sparky trundled around the living
room and grunted softly before hopping on the couch to snuggle up.
He weighs about 15 pounds and feels like a bristly, wiggly football
with a warm, rubbery snout.
   Bryant can't say enough good about her pigs, but she confessed
they have two weaknesses: food and telephones.
   Pigs will overeat, so Bryant recommends a strict diet of mini
pig chow. They also like treats like peanuts, raisins and fruits.
   As for the telephone, Bryant said, ``They like to knock it off
the hook and push the buttons. It's cute but it's annoying.''
   Bryant has a U.S. Department of Agriculture permit to breed the
pigs but she said no special permission was needed in Montgomery
County to keep them as pets. However, some localities classify all
pigs as livestock, so it's important for would-be owners to make
sure they can keep pigs as pets.

   A tentative decision by the Environmental
Protection Agency to ban the EBDC pesticides widely used on many
important food crops may erupt as a major 1990 agricultural issue
on Capitol Hill.
   The agency proposed a week ago to halt the use of EBDCs on 45
food products, including tomatoes, potatoes, bananas and lettuce.
   Critics of the plans say it will boost consumer food prices and
cause hardships for growers.
   Used by farmers since the 1930s to combat fungus and mildew, the
pesticides _ which include some such as Maneb and Zineb familiar to
home gardners _ have been linked to cancer.
   Although hailed by the Bush administration as a move to protect
consumers, the EPA announcement is producing some concerns as it
gradually sinks in.
   For example, Rep. Charles Hatcher, D-Ga., chairman of the House
Agriculture subcommittee on domestic marketing, consumer relations
and nutrition, has been contacted by farm groups in Georgia who are
concerned about the planned curb on EBDCs.
   Press Secretary Krista Harden said Hatcher is consulting with a
state coalition that has formed around the EBDC issue and may hold
hearings on the subject when Congress returns in January.
   ``The ban is too severe,'' said Lowell Peavy, owner of Peavy
Farm Service in Camilla, Ga., which sells fertilizer to local
farmers. ``We fear we are going to fall in the same category as the
apple people with Alar.''
   Peavy said he fears area farmers will stop producing without
EBDCs and that will hurt his fertilizer business.
   The product is the main fungicide used on leafy vegetables, said
Peavy, who said it can easily be washed off.
   ``But if you ate the plant without washing it you would have to
eat 13,000 pounds of it to get the amount the rat had on the
test,'' said Peavy.
   He said the coalition of producers and agribusinessmen he is
leading, which calls itself the American Food Security Coalition,
wants Congress to stop the EPA from removing EBDC from the market.
   He said the group is contacting Georgia's two senators and
congressmen from farm areas.
   In Idaho, where potatoes are high on the financial menu, Gov.
Cecil Andrus advised his state's congressional delegation in
letters that the EPA decision is causing havoc.
   ``We need a competent, credible Environmental Protection Agency
to deal with the multitude of environmental concerns,'' he said.
``We do not need an agncy that deals in scare tactics and
misinformation.''
   Much of the EPA's case against EBDCs rests on laboratory tests
that show a byproduct of the fungicide called ETU causes cancer in
animals and likely causes cancer in humans if lifelong exposure is
significant.
   Health experts say chronic exposure to EBDCs also raises the
risks of birth defects or thyroid disorders.
   In September, manufacturers of EBDCs announced they would
voluntarily halt sales of the fungicide for use on 42 food products
at the end of this year, accounting for about 40 percent to 50
percent of the total sold annually.
   However, EPA administrator William Reilly said on Dec. 4 that
the voluntary ban doesn't go far enough and should be extended to
tomatoes, potatoes and bananas, which together account for nearly
one-third of the EBDCs used.
   The Agriculture Department, nominally the governmental voice and
defender of American farmers, has been quiet since the EPA
announcement.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter joined EPA's Reilly and
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan in a statement
defending the plan to cancel some of the EBDC pesticides.
   The statement expressed confidence that American consumers can
``continue to eat fruits and vegetables'' without fearing the
potential risks of the chemicals, at least until an EPA market
basket survey is completed in 1991 to determine how much of the
EBDCs are potentially present.
   Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary, said Yeutter has not
elaborated beyond that statement since EPA announced its plan.
   Sen. Patrict Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, called for ``a wholesale reform of our pesticide laws''
instead of ``tentative half steps'' that may take years to
accomplish.
   But Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho, warned against a further
tightening of federal restrictions. The EPA curb on fungicides is
just a beginning, he told the state's Farm Bureau last week.
   ``EPA now has a bit in its teeth, and they are running,'' he
said. ``They will push as far as they can go, and they will test to
see how far they can push.''
   The American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farm
organization, offered guarded comment. It is appropriate, said
federation president Dean Kleckner, to review the EBDC situation,
but a ban on the use of some of the fungicides would pose hardships
for many.
   ``Crops, especially those grown in humid regions, are vulnerable
to fungal diseases, such as mold, mildew, rot and scab,'' he said.
``There are simply no satisfactory alternatives for many of the
prescribed EBDC uses.''
   Kleckner cited a recent study by GRC Economics, a Washington,
D.C., consulting firm, which concluded the loss of all fungicides
would reduce fruit production by 32 percent and vegetables by 21
percent. Consumer food prices would rise 13 percent, overall, the
study said.

   The Corpus Christi Caller-Times has
named new associate, managing and metro editors.
   The new associate editor, Nick Jimenez, has been city editor of
the daily newspaper for the past three years, it was announced
Sunday. David House was named managing editor and Tom Whitehurst
Jr. metro editor.
   Jimenez' responsibilities will include special projects,
strategic and long-range planning and being part of the newspaper's
editorial board, said Executive Editor Larry L. Rose.
   The 46-year-old San Antonio native, a Corpus Christi
newspaperman since 1968, was the Times' city editor from 1980 to
1986. The Times and the Caller merged in 1987.
   House, who earlier supervised the news desk, will direct daily
news-gathering operations as managing editor, said Rose. House
replaces former Managing Editor Norma Sosa.
   As metro editor, Whitehurst will oversee city and area coverage,
the newspaper said. He has been an assistant city editor since 1986.
   House, who joined the Caller-Times in 1987, was an editor on the
national and foreign desks of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times and
Sunday editor of The Denver Post.
   Whitehurst, 32, joined the Caller-Times as a copy editor in 1983
and became an assistant city editor in 1986.

<HEAD>Taiwan Group to Acquire Wyse Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group of government and
local enterprises has agreed to acquire the California-based
computer products company Wyse Technology Inc. in a cash deal
valued at $268 million, both groups announced today.
   The buyout would be the largest ever of a foreign firm by Taiwan.
   Under the agreement, the Taiwan group, known as the Channel
International Corp., would buy all Wyse's shares for $10 each, said
Koo Cheng-fu, chairman of China Investment and Trust Co., the
largest investor in the buyout.
   ``The acquisition is an important step for Taiwan's electronics
and computer industries to enter the world market,'' Koo told a
news conference.
   Koo said his group would use Wyse's sales channels and
technology personnel to promote Taiwan's high-technology products.
   Koo's company will offer 29 percent of the capital for the
investment.
   The acquisition also was supported by Taiwan's Cabinet, which
offered 20 percent of the total investment from a development fund.
Other investors include Mitac Computers, a local computer
manufacturer, and two petrochemical companies.
   The acquisition, which was approved by Wyse's board of
directors, is expected to be completed next week.
   Wyse, based in San Jose, Calif., holds about a 50 percent market
share for general-purpose terminals in the United States. It also
produces monitors and IBM-compatible personal computers.
   Wyse officials began a search for buyers earlier this year after
the 8-year-old company suffered a loss of $21 million in the 1989
fiscal year ended March 31, compared with a $28 million profit the
previous year.
   Wyse Chairman Bernard K. Tse said the acquisition ``provides
shareholders an opportunity to maximize the value of their shares
at this time.''
   Daniel Wu, president of Channel International, said the group's
main objective will be to improve business. He said he was
confident demand for computer terminals would remain strong.
   Taiwanese businessmen have shown growing interest in acqusition
of foreign firms, which they believe could help boost their
business in the world market.
   Last month, Samuel Hsieh, governor of the Central Bank, proposed
to use Taiwan's foreign reserves of about $73 billion for loans to
local enterprises for overseas acquisitions.
   In August, Continental Engineering Corp., Taiwan's leading
construction company, acquired American Bridge Co. of Pittsburgh,
for an estimated $70 million to $100 million.

<HEAD>Government's Latest Sale is 5.7 Times Oversubscribed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's $8.3 billion sale of its water
industry was 5.7 times oversubscribed, attracting the second
highest number of applicants for a British privatization, officials
said Monday.
   Demand for shares of the 10 water authorities of England and
Wales was strong enough to trigger ``clawback'' provisions that
will give small investors nearly half the stock instead of the
previously planned 27 percent.
   Most investors will get far fewer shares than they asked for in
the sale, which totals 5.24 billion pounds.
   ``It is a great success,'' Environment Minister Michael Howard
said. ``We have proved our critics wrong.''
   Some 2.7 million people made applications, the second highest
response ever for a government privatization after the 4.5 million
applicants in British Gas PLC sale.
   There had been concern that the sale would be unsuccessful
because the stock market has been in the doldrums and the
privatization has faced stiff opposition from critics who believed
such a vital utility should remain government-owned.
   Trading in the shares officially begins Tuesday on London's
Stock Exchange. In the ``gray,'' or unofficial, market the shares
were trading at 126 pence, or $1.99, at midday Monday.
   The government is selling 2.183 million shares at 240 pence, or
$3.79, each but investors only put 100 pence down and pay the rest
off in installments.
   Under the ``clawback'' provisions in the water sale,
institutional investors now will get 39 percent of the shares, and
foreign investors the remainder. Each investor everyone will get at
least 100 shares.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold off billions of pounds worth of state-owned companies in the
past decade to promote capitalism in Britain.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with AT&amp;T spokesman confirming job cuts.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans to trim
another 8,500 jobs from its work force in 1990 after cutting about
25,000 this year, the company confirmed today.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Walter G. Murphy said the company has been
planning next year's reductions for some time and already has
notified employees.
   ``The people in the departments that are affected by the job
reductions planned for 1990 have been informed,'' he said.
   The Wall Street Journal reported on the cuts in today's editions
and quoted unidentified sources as saying that they could be part
of a wider work force reduction campaign in 1990.
   Murphy declined to characterize the reductions or to comment on
how sweeping they would be.
   Most of the 1990 reductions will occur in AT&amp;T's Network
Services division, which has 37,600 workers and runs AT&amp;T's
long-distance network, Murphy said. Employees were told on Nov. 28
of plans to reduce the division staff by 6,000 jobs.
   Additionally, the company plans to cut 700 jobs in its Business
Communications Systems unit, 1,400 jobs in its Material Management
&amp; Service unit, and 400 jobs in its General Business Systems
division in 1990.
   The Business Communications Systems unit, which supplies office
phone services to big businesses, has 15,000 workers while the
General Business Systems division, which handles phone service for
smaller companies, has 11,200 workers. Material Management &amp;
Services has 8,700 workers.
   Murphy said advances in technology have been behind much of the
job cutting at AT&amp;T. The company envisioned thousands of cuts as it
upgrades its long-distance phone network to a more efficient
digital system by the end of next year, for instance.
   The big communications company has intensified its efforts to
steamline operations lately by automating factories and back-office
facilities and by breaking itself down into smaller, more focused
units.
   AT&amp;T has almost frozen hiring and instead has redeployed
existing staff into vacant positions.
   ``We're on a drive to right-size this place to be competitive,''
Harold W. Burlingame, vice president of human resources at AT&amp;T,
told the Journal. ``Our managers are quickly learning that they
must focus on costs, customers and competitors.''
   Most of this year's cuts have come through early retirement or
attrition, but several thousand have come through unannounced cuts.
   Since 1984 when the company divested its regional operating
companies, AT&amp;T has cut about 90,000 jobs. The company will have a
payroll of about 280,000 employees by January.

   College graduates this spring will
make more money, but find fewer job opportunities, according to a
survey of nearly 500 U.S. employers.
   Hires will be down 13.3 percent compared to last year, according
to the 19th annual survey by Michigan State University's Career
Development and Placement Services office.
   The average starting salary for a graduate with a bachelor's
degree will be $25,256, up 3.3 percent from a year ago. The
expected starting salary for master's of business administration
graduates will be $39,840, a 3.1 percent increase; $33,740 for
master's degree graduates, up 3.3 percent; and $37,111 for
graduates with doctoral degrees, a 2.4 percent increase.
   As in recent years, engineering majors will get the highest
starting salaries for new college graduates, with chemical
engineering leading the way at $33,380. Mechanical engineering
ranks second at $32,256, while electrical engineering is at
$32,107; computer science $31,389, and industrial engineering
$30,557.
   The lowest starting salaries will be for graduates in human
ecology-home economics, $18,157; journalism, $18,255; natural
resources, $18,840; retailing, $18,909, and advertising, $19,662.
   The survey released Sunday was based on responses from 479
employers in business, industry, government, and educational
institutions.
   Patrick Scheetz, who directed the study, said reasons for the
drop in planned hiring included limited growth in new business;
mergers and buyouts; increased global competition; and slow
turnover of current employees.
   Employers expected to have large hiring increases include:
public utilities, up 29.4 percent; metal products, up 24.2 percent;
petroleum, 22.1 percent; construction and building materials
manufacturing, 19.3 percent; printing, publishing and informational
services, 13.7 percent.
   Those expected to have decreases included automotive and
mechanical equipment, down 58 percent; electronics, 24.5 percent;
government administration, 20.9 percent; aerospace, 20 percent; the
military, 16.8 percent; and diversified conglomerates, 13.7 percent.
   The survey also found:
   _ The greatest job opportunities are in the Southwest. Next best
is the Northeast, followed by the Southeast, North-Central,
South-Central, and Northwest states.
   _ Employers requiring drug testing of new college graduates rose
to 47 percent of those surveyed, up from 32 percent last year and
27 percent the year before. Testing for alcohol was required by 25
percent of those surveyed, up from 14 percent. Testing for AIDS was
required by 4 percent of employers, a slight increase of 3 percent
for the 1988-89 graduates.

   National Semiconductor Corp.
announced Monday it earned $2.4 million in the second quarter
compared with a loss of $25.2 million for the same period last year.
   The company, citing progress in addressing inventory, capacity
and other cost issues, said it had met its goal to return to
profitability during the period, which ended Nov. 26.
   Earnings per common share, after payment of preferred dividends,
were zero in the latest quarter in contrast to a loss of 27 cents a
share a year earlier. National Semiconductor said its net sales for
the second three months of fiscal 1990 rose to $416.8 million from
$404.6 million.
   Sales for the first half of fiscal 1990 were $814.4 million,
with a net loss of $19.5 million, or 24 cents a share. Sales during
the first half of last year were $849.5 million, with a net loss of
$55.7 million, or 58 cents a share.
   The chipmaker in February announced plans to close its Danbury,
Conn., plant. In May, the company said it would close a plant in
Seoul, South Korea, and consolidate two Singapore factories in an
attempt to reduce duplication created by the acquisition of
Fairchild Semiconductor.

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose modestly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes of
increased grain sales to the Soviet Union.
   Analysts cited as a major factor the Agriculture Department's
announcement on Friday that it had increased by 4 million metric
tons to 20 million metric tons the amount of U.S. grain the Soviet
Union would be allowed to purchase during the current marketing
year.
   Some of this morning's buying also was linked to President
Bush's statement Friday that he would push for granting
most-favored-nation trade status to the Soviet Union. The
designation would allow for freer trade between the superpowers.
   Forecasts for cold, dry weather this week in the Great Plains
and the Midwest also lent support to the grain markets.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.11{ a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 1 cent higher with December at $2.37\ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $1.45
a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 2} cents higher with January at

   Cattle futures gained while pork futures fell in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Frozen pork bellies were down
the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit in early trading after limit losses
in the two previous sessions.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .62 cent higher with December at
76.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .33 cent higher

<TEXT>
   If the 1970s was the Me Decade, the 1980s was
the Money Decade.
   Free enterprise got free rein in the early years, driving the
economy ahead and making billionaires out of characters as diverse
as software entrepreneur Bill Gates and junk-bond wizard Michael
Milken.
   But that unbridled pursuit of wealth turned Americans queasy
well before the end of the decade. Ambition fostered as much greed
as achievement, and great successes often were matched one-for-one
by crises.
   The economy's durable growth was threatened by an overhang of
debt. The bull market produced scandals and a Black Monday crash.
Go-go lending led to a savings and loan debacle.
   For the business world, it was a decade of revolution followed
by reaction in three main arenas: political, technological and
financial.
   Politically, the decade began on Jan. 20, 1981, the day the
hostages came home from Iran and Ronald Reagan took office
promising ``to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government
back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden.''
   Within months, Reagan broke an illegal strike by the air traffic
controllers union and proposed a giant tax cut.
   That same year, International Business Machines Corp. rolled out
its first personal computer in a strike against young Steve Jobs
and Steve Wozniak at Apple Computer Inc. With IBM's blessing, the
PC changed from a futuristic gadget into a deadly serious business
tool.
   In finance, jut-browed Michael Milken, just 35 in 1981, was
using high-yielding ``junk'' bonds to raise money for companies
shunned by traditional bond buyers _ companies like fast-growing
MCI Communications Corp.
   William McGowan, MCI's baggy-eyed gladiator, used junk bonds and
the federal courts in an assault on the world's largest company,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. In 1982, AT&amp;T succumbed to
government antitrust lawyers and agreed to the 1984 breakup of the
Bell System.
   The walls were tumbling down. Across the Atlantic, Margaret
Thatcher was dismantling British socialism with a vengeance.
Markets became freer as well in Western Europe, which envisioned a
true common marketplace by 1992, and Japan, which grew into a
global economic powerhouse.
   In the United States, the buoyant new spirit was best understood
in contrast with the 1970s, a brutal decade marred by the Vietnam
War, Watergate, two oil-price shocks, stagflation and ineffective
government tinkering with the economy.
   Richard Nixon had tried wage and price controls. Gerald Ford had
passed out WIN buttons, promising to Whip Inflation Now. As late as
1980, Jimmy Carter was trying to discipline the economy with the
first peacetime credit controls in U.S. history, including curbs on
the use of credit cards. Banks' prime lending rate briefly topped
21 percent in 1980 and the price of gold, an inflation refuge,
surpassed $800 an ounce.
   Reagan came into office with a radically different agenda,
convinced that cutting tax rates would unleash so much economic
activity that tax revenue would actually increase. Arthur Laffer
had sketched out the supply-side theory on a napkin in 1974.
   It didn't happen exactly as Reagan wished. The tax cuts produced
fat budget deficits. Fortunately for him, though, budget deficits
are painless, at least in the short run. The pain was inflicted by
Paul Volcker, the stern, 6-foot-7 chairman of the Federal Reserve,
who pushed up interest rates to squeeze out inflation.
   Volcker's medicine produced the deepest recession since World
War II, with unemployment rates topping 10 percent in the summer of
1982. But it did wring inflationary expectations out of the system,
and by that November, the economy began an expansion that continues
to this day, the longest in U.S. peacetime history.
   In contrast to the inward-looking Me Decade, Americans looked
outward in the '80s because the business world demanded it. The old
order was fractured and they were forced to make new choices.
Fixed-rate mortgage or adjustable? IRA or 401(k)? AT&amp;T or MCI or
Sprint?
   Carter had launched deregulation, in airlines, trucking and
banking, but it was Reagan who became the movement's spiritual
godfather.
   The Money Decade made economic creatures of us all. Business
news leaped to the front page. Financial News Network was born. Lee
Iacocca became a best-selling author. ``Dallas'' and ``Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous'' were voyeuristic hits.
   Americans exulted in capitalism in the early '80s, none more
than Phoenix financier Charles Keating, who built an empire by
buying savings and loans and speculating with the money deposited
in them.
   By 1989, Charles Keating faced accusations that he had looted or
abused depositors' funds while bribing U.S. senators with political
donations.
   Keating's downfall capped a series of events beginning in the
mid-1980s that turned many Americans against the excesses of the
decade. All three revolutions _ political, financial and
technological _ were in some way tarnished.
   In 1985, the United States, world champion of free enterprise,
became a net debtor for the first time since the eve of World War I.
   In November 1986, Ivan Boesky surrendered $100 million and
agreed to plead guilty to a felony as a budding government probe of
insider trading sideswiped Wall Street's roaring bull market.
   On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged a
record 508 points, intensifying concerns about the health and
fairness of the markets.
   In 1988, Americans learned that the previous year's trade
deficit had hit a record $152 billion _ a hemorrhage of $4,800 a
second.
   The crowning blow came in 1989, when taxpayers found out that
the deregulated and fraud-riddled savings and loan industry would
require a $159 billion bailout.
   It began to seem the Reagan Revolution had not kept the United
States from digging itself into a deep hole of debt; that
untrammeled markets could get dangerously out of balance; and that
deregulation had opened the cookie jar to shameless thieves.
   Even the long-lived economic expansion was less impressive when
it became apparent how little it had done to raise living
standards. After adjustment for inflation, hourly earnings of
non-supervisory workers actually were lower throughout the 1980s
than in 1969.

   Thus came the reaction.
   In politics, Reagan belied his free-trading reputation by
signing legislation protecting American steel, autos, textiles and
sugar. His administration quit its laissez-faire attitude toward
the overvalued dollar, which threatened to gut American industry by
making imports a better buy than goods made in the U.S.A.
   Government supervision of the savings and loans was toughened
and there were moves toward re-regulation of airlines, cable
television, the financial markets, clean air and job safety.
   Meanwhile, each foreign purchase of an American institution _
CBS Records, Columbia Pictures, Rockefeller Center, Burger King _
brought fresh calls for restrictions on foreign ownership.
   The more liberal lawmakers even dared call for an industrial
policy _ a coordinated program for rebuilding America's economic
strength that sounded to conservatives like wasteful ``lemon''
socialism.
   By late in the decade, polls showed Americans viewed Japan as a
bigger threat than the Soviet Union, proof that the Money Decade
had wrought changes in attitudes about money and power.
   In finance, Milken's revolution lost some of its luster as junk
bonds became associated in the public's mind with hostile
takeovers. Heavy debts from buyouts and mergers sapped momentum
from the takeover rush and prompted questions about the wisdom of
financing through leverage.
   While some takeovers promoted efficiency by forcing managers to
lop off unproductive enterprises, they also forced undue emphasis
on short-term profitability to pay off debt, in direct contrast to
the forward-thinking Japanese.
   Corporations erected sophisticated defenses to ward off takeover
threats and some states even passed laws to keep out raiders. The
crash-rattled financial markets, meanwhile, imposed ``circuit
breakers'' to forestall another collapse.
   The technology revolution came through mostly unscathed.
Powerful personal computers seemed to be on every desk.
Biotechnology gave new life to medicine and fiber optics turned the
phone network into an eight-lane voice and data expressway.
   If the technological advances had a dark side, it was the fear
that too many people were left behind by an economy based on
knowledge and skill. Laborers and clerks were replaced by machinery
or silicon chips. An unskilled, despairing underclass grew
increasingly detached from the rest of society.
   The revolutions and reactions of the Money Decade echoed a
historic American theme: the contest between liberty and equality.
More liberty generally means less equality; less liberty means more
equality.
   The contest, far from resolved here at home, now engages a world
of players as the '90s approach.
   Out of desperation, Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union, Eastern
Europe and Latin America are giving once-hated capitalism a chance
in spite of the risk of upheaval. A new Soviet opinion poll shows
widespread resentment of the newly rich and craving for a return to
``a strong hand'' over the economy.
   For those who will struggle with the choices of free enterprise
in the future, the '80s left clear warnings. More growth can equal
less security. With freedom comes the responsibility to manage
greedy extremes.
   Americans lived that dilemma in the 1980s. Now the rest of the
world is taking its turn.

<HEAD>Americans Pick Japan as the Economic Power of the '80s</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Decade-Poll Method</HEAD>

   Americans overwhelmingly believe the United
States has fumbled away its economic supremacy to Japan in the
1980s, yet few expect their personal finances to suffer in the
coming decade, a national survey has found.
   Nearly seven in 10 respondents in the Media General-Associated
Press poll said they believe Japan, not the United States, is the
leading economic power in the world today. Just 26 percent said
America leads.
   At the same time, however, fewer than two in 10 respondents said
their family's finances had worsened in the past 10 years. And
fewer still, just 13 percent, expected their finances to
deteriorate in the decade ahead.
   The youngest respondents, aged 18 to 29, were the most
optimistic about their financial future. And they were the least
apt to believe the United States' economic position has slipped in
the past decade.
   But their elders were solidly convinced of the United States'
slide. Six in 10 said the country's economic leadership weakened in
the 1980s, while just 14 percent believed the U.S. economy grew
stronger.
   Despite that perception, there was only minority support for a
greater federal role in industrial development. Fifty-one percent
preferred to have market forces direct industry's fortunes, while
37 percent said they favored government help in financing selected
industries. The rest were unsure.
   Opinion was divided on some factors in the nation's economic
performance in the 1980s. Respondents split evenly on whether
government deregulation had been good or bad for the economy, and
they also split on whether the stock market had been a help or
hindrance.
   But there was general agreement on other issues: Nearly seven in
10 said competition from foreign imports had hurt the economy in
the past decade, and about six in 10 said foreign investment in the
United States had hurt.
   Even more, nearly eight in 10, said the federal deficit had
damaged the economy. About half said corporate mergers had hurt,
with others split on whether mergers helped or made no difference.
   Of all the factors posed, only one was widely seen as a benefit:
The increasing number of women in the work force was said by 77
percent to have helped the economy in the 1980s. Men and women
shared that view equally.
   On many issues, opinion split along political lines. Republicans
were a bit more sanguine about U.S. economic leadership; 48 percent
of them said it had weakened, vs. 61 percent of Democrats and
independents.
   Similarly, 31 percent of the Republicans polled picked the
United States as the world's leading economy today, while just 23
percent of the others agreed. And 40 percent of Republicans and
independents said deregulation had been good for the economy, vs.
28 percent of the Democrats.
   More Republicans may hold positive views of the economy because
more were doing better. Sixty-five percent said their family's
financial situation had improved in the 1980s; that fell to 46
percent of Democrats and 42 percent of the independents.
   The poll was a telephone survey, so the 7 percent of the
population without phones _ generally the poorest Americans _ could
not be included. In the telephone households contacted, 52 percent
overall said their family finances improved in the 1980s, 18
percent said they had worsened and 28 percent said they were about
the same. Two percent didn't answer.
   Looking to the future, 49 percent expected better finances in
the decade ahead, 13 percent expected to do worse and 34 percent
expected their financial situation to remain about the same. Four
percent had no answer.
   The survey was conducted Nov. 17-25 among 1,117 adults and had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Nov. 17-25 with 1,117 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1a. In your opinion, which country is the world's leading
economic power right now _ the United States, Japan, West Germany,
the Soviet Union or some other country? U.S.: 26 percent. Japan: 68
percent. West Germany: 1 percent. Soviet Union: 1. Other: 0. Don't
know or no answer: 4.
   b. (if U.S.) Do you think the United States will remain the
world's leading economic power during the next 10 years, or not?
Yes: 71. No: 17. DK-NA: 11.
   2. Do you think the United States' economic leadership has
strengthened during the last 10 years, gotten weaker, or remained
at about the same level? Strengthened: 16. Weaker: 56. Same: 26.
DK-NA: 3.
   3. Do you think the federal government should help finance new
industries it wants to develop, or should it let market forces
determine which industries get established? Government: 37. Market:
51. DK-NA: 13.
   4. Compared to 10 years ago, is your family's financial
situation better today, or worse today, or about the same? Better:
52. Worse: 18. Same: 28. DK-NA: 2.
   5. In the next 10 years, do you expect your family's financial
situation to get better, or worse, or remain about the same?
Better: 49. Worse: 13. Same: 34. DK-NA: 4.
   6. For each of the following, please tell me if you think it's
been good or bad for the nation's economy in the last 10 years, or
if it hasn't made much difference:
   a. Corporate mergers. Good: 20. Bad: 51. No difference: 20.
DK-NA: 10.
   b. Government deregulation. Good: 35. Bad: 34. No difference:
15. DK-NA: 17.
   c. The stock market. Good: 29. Bad: 26. No difference: 27.
DK-NA: 19.
   d. More women in the work force. Good: 77. Bad: 11. No
difference: 9. DK-NA: 4.
   e. The federal deficit. Good: 5. Bad: 78. No difference: 10.
DK-NA: 7.
   f. Competition from foreign imports. Good: 20. Bad: 68. No
difference: 6. DK-NA: 6.

<HEAD>Of Yuppies and Soft Landings: The Buzzwords of the '80s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business News</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Yuppies and couch potatoes. Bailouts and bundlings.Soft landings
and hard landings.
   The 1980s were the salad days for bizspeak, buzzwords and lousy
metaphors.
   Business people tried to stay ahead of the curve by shooting
from the lip with just the right jargon to show they were players,
not bean counters.
   To say it in the '80s, you had to coin it _ or so it seemed from
the flood of new and retreaded idioms unleashed during the Money
Decade.
   Below are some of the serious and not-so-serious entries from
the decade's business lexicon:
   ARBITRAGE: Wall Street's high-stakes game of ``buying low and
selling high'' simultaneously. A variation of the strategy was used
by the decade's most notorious ``arb,'' Ivan Boesky, to speculate
in takeover stocks. The word at first sent business writers
scurrying for dictionaries, but by decade's end arbitrage was
synonymous with wheeling and dealing.
   BAILOUT: A government rescue. Corporations averted a crash
landing by parachuting into Uncle Sam's warm embrace, among them
Chrysler Corp., Continental Bank and many savings and loans.
   BEAN COUNTER: Pejoratively, a back-office type, often from
accounting, disparaged for watching the bottom line. Some say they
gained inordinate power in the '80s.
   BUNDLING: Packaging debt _ from leveraged buyouts to mortgages _
in nice tidy bundles for sale to investors.
   CORRECTION: An optimist's view of a sharp drop in market prices.
It supposedly prepares the way for a resumed rise.
   COUCH POTATO: Aging yuppie now living in the suburbs;
financially satiated though highly mortgaged; eats in a lot and
watches the VCR.
   DEINDUSTRIALIZATION: Bemoans the decline of U.S. manufacturing.
It became less popular in the decade's final years when Americans
realized the United States was still making cars, refrigerators,
even television sets.
   EURO: A much-used prefix for anything vaguely European as 1992
approaches. Sample: ``Euro-pessimism (or Euro-sclerosis) is
becoming Euro-phoria as 12 Western European countries prepare to
unite in one trading community.''
   GLOBALIZATION: The new world where corporate power transcends
national boundaries and the United States is not the only economic
superpower.
   GOLDEN: As in parachute, umbrella or handcuffs. It describes a
lucrative goodbye handed to corporate executives.
   GREATER FOOL THEORY: An explanation for why stocks rise.
Investors overpay on the assumption they will be able to unload on
someone else at an even dearer price.
   GREENMAIL: Refers to the color of the payoff raiders get for
quitting the hunt. It is more than average shareholders can get,
thus the echo of blackmail.
   INSIDER TRADER: Boesky is alleged to have been one, along with
dozens of others caught up in the government's crackdown on
securities fraud in the '80s. They are so described for trading
stock on the basis of secret information that gives them an unfair
advantage.
   JAPANESE: America's chief economic rival; synonymous with
quality, efficiency, reliability; also, fear, loathing and power.
   JOINT VENTURE: What many U.S. businesses resorted to when the
going got rough against foreign competitors. If you couldn't beat
'em, you joined 'em in the '80s.
   JUNK BONDS: Securities pulled from the scrap heap of corporate
finance by Michael Milken, among others. These high-risk,
high-yield debt securities helped fuel the stock market boom and
merger mania.
   LBO: One of the best-known acronyms of the age, short for
``leveraged buyout,'' where companies are bought with mostly
borrowed money. RJR Nabisco was the biggest ever at $25 billion.
   PLAYER: The opposite of bean counter. It stands for the
pin-striped, suspendered gamblers who pull off the big deals.
   POISON PILL: What a company might swallow to avert a takeover.
In extreme cases, it can force the company to take on debilitating
debt.
   PRIVATIZATION: The sale of nationally owned companies to
investors, as with Japan's phone company and several British
industries.
   REAGANOMICS: A potpourri of policies by the Reagan
Administration to reduce taxes, increase defense spending and
decrease social spending. The latter caused the term to become a
rallying cry of Reagan critics.
   RESTRUCTURING, DOWNSIZING: Euphemisms for cost-cutting, laying
off workers and attaining more profits with fewer employees.
   SHARK: Any of a variety of predators notorious for their
voracious appetite for takeovers and unfriendly assaults on
innocent companies. Also known as ``corporate raider'' or
euphemistically as ``financier.''
   SOFT LANDING, HARD LANDING: Terms launched by economists to
describe ways the economy can slow down.
   SUPPLY SIDE: Theory sketched out by economics professor Arthur
Laffer and adopted by President Reagan, holding that cutting taxes
will stimulate the economy and increase productivity without
fueling inflation.
   TAKEOVER: What you don't want to happen to your company, but
probably will.
   TWIN DEFICITS: The federal budget deficit and the trade
imbalance. Also known as the ``twin towers'' in reference to their
hugeness.
   YUPPIE: Acronym for young urban professional. It describes any
ambitious, affluent, self-obsessed, well-educated free spender.
Japan has Juppies and Germany, Guppies. It also spawned offshoots
like ``sitcom,'' for single income outrageous mortgages, and
``dink,'' for dual income no kids.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has produced cut-rate airline tickets,
higher interest rates for savers and lower long-distance costs _
but the deregulation of American enterprise carries a price tag,
too.
   For openers, there's the $50 billion now, plus perhaps $100
billion later, to bail out the savings and loan industry, in
trouble before deregulation and in worsening straits afterward.
With the bailout came, belatedly, a stringent system of regulation
to oversee every facet of the industry.
   The low-cost air service that is said to be saving travelers and
shippers more than $14 billion a year doesn't reach everywhere;
fares into smaller, non-competitive cities are as steep or steeper
than before.
   Deregulation in telecommunications is still contentious, in the
courts and in Congress. Long-distance costs less, some local
services more. There are a dozen bills seeking some measure of
re-regulation of cable television.
   In other deregulated industries, some prices are higher, some
services lacking, and surveys indicate that wages are generally
lower than would be the case had regulation remained.
   Overall, though, the consensus among economic analysts is that
the United States is better off with deregulation than without it.
Among economists, that judgment spans the political spectrum,
conservative to liberal. There's less unanimity among politicians,
some of whom pick targets and threaten regulatory moves to get at
them.
   There's been congressional talk, for example, of regulation to
make sure that television viewers don't someday have to pay to see
the pro football Super Bowl.
   Deregulation has been a selective process. New Deal-era
regulation of industry and transportation has been phased out,
while regulation involving the environment, health and safety has
been increasing.
   While there may be a backlash on some issues, nobody expects a
reversal of the trend toward deregulation.
   ``Unless you repeal technology, I don't think you'll ever be
able to go back to the old, regulated system,'' said James L.
Gattuso, regulatory affairs analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation.
   A bill making its way through Congress would have the government
intervene against airline takeovers on safety or competitive
grounds, a measure opposed by the administration as creeping
re-regulation.
   A more drastic measure proposed by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, with two Republican co-sponsors, would have the government
reinstate regulation of fares, routes and service. While that is
not likely to pass, it reflects discontent with some of the fallout
of deregulation.
   ``Congress is going to do a little tinkering, to show that
they're doing something,'' said Clifford Winston, a Brookings
Institution specialist on deregulation in the transportation
industry.
   Ronald Reagan was president during much of the deregulation
decade, and his administration boasted of easing or undoing
shackles on business. But little was accomplished after his first
term.
   Major regulatory overhauls of the past decade were shaped before
Reagan's presidency, some by Democrats. Indeed, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., was an early advocate of airline deregulation,
which began while Jimmy Carter was president.
   Economist William A. Niskanen, a former Reagan economic adviser,
flunked the last Republican administration on regulatory relief and
reform. ``Although this program started with a bang, it ended with
a whimper,'' he wrote.
   Near the end of Reagan's first term, ``attempts to rein in the
regulatory establishment virtually ceased,'' according to a study
by Melinda Warren and Kenneth Chilton at the Center for the Study
of American Business in St. Louis.
   Warren and Chilton found that regulatory agencies grew during
his administration, with two notable exceptions. The Civil
Aeronautics Board, which used to regulate airline routes and fares,
was shut down, and the Interstate Commerce Commission cut its
spending by nearly two-thirds.
   The Environmental Protection Agency grew the most, with spending
up 70 percent during the two Reagan terms. The government spends
more than four times as much on social regulation to protect
health, safety and the environment as it spends on economic
regulation.
   Among the landmarks of deregulation in the 1980s:
   _AIRLINES. Route and rate decontrol began in 1978. The Civil
Aeronautics Board was shut down in 1982. The Federal Aviation
Administration regulates the airlines on safety matters. Estimates
of the economic benefits of an expanding airline industry range up
to about $15 billion a year. Fares are about 29 percent lower than
they would have been without deregulation, according to a Brookings
analysis.
   But there also have been bankruptcies and more than a dozen
major takeovers, prompting the proposals for revived regulation.
And the growth in air travel also has led to airport congestion and
delays.
   _BROADCASTING. Most programming requirements and limits on
commercials were dropped by the Federal Communications Commission;
first for radio, then, in 1984, for television. Station license
renewals were simplified as programming checks were dropped. A
lottery system supplanted fitness exams as the basis for choosing
among competitors for new licenses in such fields as cellular
telephone service, low-power and pay television systems.
   The Reagan FCC dropped the fairness doctrine, which had required
balance in broadcast coverage of controversial issues. The
Democratic-controlled Congress is trying to reinstate it.
   The deregulation trend dates from the Carter administration,
when the FCC eased cable television restrictions and began the
process for broadcasters.
   _TELEPHONE SERVICE. The breakup of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. completed what had begun nearly 20 years before when
Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson was president. The 1982 settlement,
effective in 1984, split telephone operating companies away from
AT&amp;T and set rules fostering competition in long-distance service.
That eased regulation but didn't undo it on long-distance rates,
which still are subject to the FCC and state regulators.
   _BANKING. The thrifts were already in trouble before Congress
voted to ease regulation of the investments they could make and the
amount of interest they could offer depositors. Shaky savings and
loans could, and did, make high-risk investments to try to pull
even. Speculators had an easy time attracting money because the
government insured deposits.
   The danger of default was not so clear in the early 1980s. The
Reagan administration unsuccessfully sought broader deregulation,
on the theory that banks and savings and loans could then compete
more effectively in a changing financial world. President Bush
confronted a worsening S&amp;L crisis when he took office, and answered
with the bailout bill he signed last summer.
   _TRUCKING, RAILROAD FREIGHT. They were partly deregulated under
legislation passed in 1980, before Reagan. Surveys point to lower
shipping costs. Winston, at the Brookings Institution, is about to
publish a study that will indicate savings and benefits in surface
transportation of more than $14 billion.
   One analyst, reviewing the decade in 1988, said economic
deregulation reduced prices and costs in every industry in which it
was tried. Roger Noll, a Stanford University economist, said the
benefit didn't show everywhere because in some places, especially
rural America, regulators had set prices below costs, and offset
them by charging more elsewhere.
   Noll said deregulation increased employment in the industries
involved, but at generally lower wages, savings that represent a
substantial share of the reduction in prices and costs.
   For all of that, as he noted in a study published by the
American Enterprise Institute, the regulatory structure that was in
place 20 years ago is almost intact.
   No major overhaul is in prospect. The Bush administration is
committed to deregulation; as vice president, George Bush headed a
task force on regulatory reform. But regulatory change is not high
on the administration's priority list.

<HEAD>After Decade of Deregulation, Airlines Facing Challenges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest airline company is a
conglomeration of big and small carriers flying under the regional
banner of Texas Air Corp.
   Almost every other major carrier has been a target for takeover
or restructuring.
   Airports are clogged, fares are inscrutable, and the commercial
fleet is showing its age with frightening regularity.
   That is probably not the future the architects of deregulation
imagined in 1978 when the airline industry was freed from
government control over fares and routes.
   But that future is now, after little more than a decade of
freewheeling competition.
   For business students of the 1980s, there was no more compelling
case study of the impact of Reagan-era deregulation. No industry
underwent more wrenching changes. None moved from controls to
competition to consolidation as quickly.
   In October 1988, the airlines celebrated their first decade of
freedom. Less than a year later, the industry was engulfed by a
wave of takeover fever, its second since deregulation began.
   ``I'm uneasy about the wave of buyouts,'' said Alfred Kahn, a
former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board who is widely
considered the father of airline deregulation. ``The critical thing
is, how does it affect competition?''
   In the space of a week last August, United Airlines, the
nation's second-largest carrier, was put into play by a $5.4
billion buyout bid for parent UAL Corp. from oilman Marvin Davis;
an investor group completed its $3.65 billion buyout of NWA Inc.,
parent of Northwest Airlines; frequently rumored takeover target
USAir Group Inc. completed its merger with Piedmont Aviation and
separately sold a major stake to ``white knight'' investor Warren
Buffett; and a manufacturing company said it might consider a
takeover of Midway Airlines.
   While the fierce competition sparked by deregulation turned many
airlines into hot properties, it put others in desperate straits.
In 1989, three carriers filed for bankruptcy protection under
Chapter 11: Texas Air's Eastern Airlines, hit by a crippling strike
in early March; Braniff Inc., which filed for the second time in
seven years; and Presidential Airways, a feeder carrier for United.
   As some companies faltered, the takeover frenzy continued to
build, culminating in developer Donald Trump's $7.5 billion buyout
proposal in October for AMR Corp., parent of industry leader
American Airlines.
   When UAL failed to assemble financing for its $6.75 billion
pilot-management buyout _ an announcement that caused a sudden
190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13 _ the
mania subsided temporarily.
   But UAL talks revived, and experts said the reshaping of the
industry will continue in the '90s.
   Airlines in Western Europe are positioning themselves to exploit
the Common Market deregulation set to begin in 1992, and some are
swooping down to buy pieces of U.S. carriers.
   The prospect of foreign ownership and the heavy debts associated
with takeovers have prompted warnings from officials in Washington,
including Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   Under U.S. law, foreign airlines aren't allowed to own more than
25 percent of the voting stock of domestic carriers. In October,
Skinner used his authority to force KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the
foreign partner in the NWA deal, to cut its $400 million investment
by $225 million.
   For travelers, the fallout from deregulation has been even more
worrisome.
   The number of passengers on U.S. airlines jumped to around 455
million in 1988 from 275 million in 1978, according to the Air
Transport Association. By the year 2000, traffic is projected to be
800 million or 900 million people.
   There's nowhere near enough capacity in the system _ runways,
airport space and air traffic control _ to handle the onslaught.
   The nation's commercial fleet, meanwhile, has been aging
rapidly, from an average 8.5 years old in 1978 to 12.5 a decade
later. Aging aircraft have been blamed for some terrifying
accidents in recent years and have compelled thriving big airlines
to buy new jets.
   To upgrade their fleets, major U.S. carriers spent a record $67
billion in the first 11 months of 1989 on 1,600 new planes. Boeing
Co., the largest commercial aircraft maker, cannot keep pace. Its
backlog, swollen further by the Machinists union strike that ended
Nov. 20, is now worth $85 billion.
   The problems, and the concern about safety they have prompted,
have intensified pressure on the federal government to re-regulate
the industry, Kahn and others warn. Proposals to re-regulate the
airlines emerged in Congress in early November.
   The industry hopes it will be allowed to work out the problems.
As for the lack of capacity, ``There's a lot of immediate things
that can be done,'' Eastern President Phil Bakes said in an
interview. Bakes, a former attorney for the CAB, was influential in
drawing up the 1978 deregulation law.
   As a sign of progress, he pointed to the first meeting in
mid-October of the Aviation System Capacity Task Force _ a group
that includes representatives of the major airlines, airport
operators and the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Skinner's department is developing a new U.S. transportation
policy to take the country into the 21st century, and the FAA's new
System Capacity Office will help expedite the rebuilding of the
infrastructure.
   If those efforts fail, Skinner warned, ``We will lose the
benefits of deregulation.''

<HEAD>With BC-Decade-Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since the nation's airline industry was
deregulated in October 1978, a debate has raged on the benefits and
problems created by the move.
   Among the main benefits, according to supporters and industry
experts:
   _A ``democratization'' of air travel, formerly the domain of
relatively few Americans. The number of passengers on U.S. airlines
jumped to around 455 million last year from 275 million in 1978. By
the year 2000, that traffic is widely projected to surge to 800
million or 900 million people.
   _With nine out of 10 air travelers flying on some sort of
discount fare, the average price of a plane ticket dropped 21
percent from 1978 to 1988 with inflation taken into account,
according to the Air Transport Association.
   _A planeload of passengers takes off from an airport somewhere
in the country on an average of every 4.8 seconds.
   _Several studies of airline deregulation contend that travelers
and the economy as a whole have benefited.
   The downside:
   _Growing complaints about the concentration of the industry
around a few ``mega-carriers'' and about the dominance they wield
in and out of some cities, and through links with commuter airlines
to entire regions of the country.
   _Unprecedented congestion at busy airports and in the skies
surrounding them, with some airport planners resorting to high
landing fees to keep out smaller aircraft.
   _Concerns about aviation safety. Critics both in and out of the
industry complain that the government is unable to keep up with
traffic growth and industry fluctuations to assure a continuing
high level of safety.
   _Predictions of catastrophe and re-regulation of the industry
unless airports are expanded, new airports are built and the air
traffic control system is modernized.
   _Complaints that airline service continues to deteriorate,
especially in rural areas, while prices are allowed to soar
unfairly high in some markets, especially between busy ``hub''
airports dominated by one or two airlines.
   _A realization that the days of aviation entrepreneurs starting
an airline from scratch and taking on the competition have long
passed, the victim of the same ``mega-carriers.''

<HEAD>Bendix Deal Launched a Decade of War on Takeover Front</HEAD>

   Most Americans probably don't remember it, but a
war broke out on Aug. 25, 1982.
   It was a confrontation involving four huge U.S. corporations
that ended with Bendix Corp., initially the aggressor, getting
swallowed up and disappearing under the wing of Allied Corp.
   It may seem remote and insignificant now. But this fight from
the early 1980s helped shape a decade of wild and expensive
takeover battles that peaked in 1988 with the $25 billion purchase
of RJR Nabisco Inc. and stumbled just two months ago with the
collapse of a planned $6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp.
   Throughout the decade, takeovers had a constant companion:
controversy. Businessmen, economists and lawmakers debated whether
takeovers were good or bad for companies, employees and the country.
   The Bendix war introduced the concept of the hostile takeover
bid to many Americans. Led by high-profile chairman William Agee,
Bendix fired the first shot that August with an unwanted bid for
Martin Marietta Corp.
   Martin Marietta fought back, trying to gobble up Bendix in what
became known as the ``Pac-Man'' defense, and United Technologies
Corp. and Allied Corp. also entered the fray.
   By the time the battle ended in January 1983, Bendix had
self-destructed and become part of Allied in a $2 billion buyout
and both Martin Marietta and Allied were deeply in debt.
   Then, in 1985, just a little over two years after acquiring
Bendix, Allied merged with Signal Cos. Inc. in a $4.9 billion deal.
   As the decade progressed, buyouts got bigger and bigger. In
1988, they reached their zenith with the buyout of RJR Nabisco by
the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. Also during the
year, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. bought Kraft Inc. for $12.9 billion
and Grand Metropolitan PLC acquiredPillsbury Co. for $5.68 billion.
   Even as the stakes were raised, one deal was launched that would
begin to push the pendulum of merger mania back the other way. The
$6.6 billion purchase of Federated Department Stores Inc. by
Canada's Campeau Corp. in April 1988, helped send takeovers to
their nadir 18 months later.
   Junk bonds, the breakfast of all takeover champions, proved too
hard for investors to swallow in the Campeau deal.
   Thehigh-risk, high-yield bonds had made it possible for ``just
about anybody on the block'' to get some action going, said Jerome
E. Hass, a professor of managerial economics and finance at Cornell
University's Johnson Graduate School of Management.
   But some big dealmakers _ Campeau chief among them _ took on
more debt than they could handle and could not make their interest
payments. After Campeau's troubles became known, the junk-bond
market plunged and suddenly, it seemed next to impossible to find
money for a deal.
   No one learned that lesson harder than UAL Corp. this fall.
   Pilots and senior managers of UAL couldn't get enough banks to
finance their planned buyout of the parent of United Airlines and
the deal collapsed on Oct. 13, dragging the stock market down with
it. News of the failed buyout sent the Dow Jones industrial average
plummeting 190 points.
   Takeovers were a factor in some of Wall Street's best and worst
performances during the 1980s. Speculation about buyouts helped
propel the market to record highs but the possibility that the
takeover boom was ending contributed to the Oct. 19, 1987 crash and
the market's most recent slide.
   Amid the turmoil, the RJR Nabisco deal continued to shine, even
though the record buyout was accomplished with $4 billion of junk
bonds. Cash from the company's food and tobacco business was
expected to easily service its massive debt load.
   But even with such bright spots as RJR Nabisco, all the takeover
battles, soaring debt levels and market gyrations unsettled many
Americans.
   Workers whose companies were taken over found themselves facing
layoffs as new owners cut costs. Local officials worried about the
effect takeovers would have on their communities. Congressmen
warned that companies saddled with massive interest payments could
fail, jeopardizing the solvency of banks that helped finance the
deals.
   Other critics, citing the profits many investors made from
takeovers, said there was just too much greed.
   But supporters of the takeover process _ including the bidders
themselves _ said buyouts improved the efficiency of companies
because unnecessary jobs and expenses were eliminated. That made
the firms more profitable and able to expand, and that was good for
the economy, they said.
   Hass noted that ``companies that were potential targets have
cleaned up their act'' by restructuring and paring costs. Takeovers
indirectly helped those firms, he said.
   The negative atmosphere surrounding takeovers spawned new state
laws seeking to shield companies, their employees and communities
from becoming the pawns of takeover strategists.
   Suitors tried to dismantle the statutes, but in 1987, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled the states had the right to pass laws curbing
hostile takeovers.
   The new statutes gave companies more muscle to fight unwanted
bids. In Delaware, where more than half the Fortune 500 companies
are incorporated, a new law allowed Polaroid Corp. to use an
employee stock ownership plan and other devices to defeat a hostile
bid by Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   State courts also became deeply involved in shaping takeover law
and helped determine the outcome of several major fights.
   Delaware courts stopped Paramount Communications Inc.'s hostile
bid for Time Inc., allowing Time and Warner Communications Inc. to
proceed with a $14 billion merger.
   Legal obstacles helped persuade strategists including T. Boone
Pickens Jr. and Asher Edelman to give up hostile takeovers. They
said the process had become too complicated and too expensive, and
they turned their attention toward overseas targets _ Europe for
Edelman, and Japan for Pickens.
   For dealmakers of the future, caution may be in greater supply
than junk bonds.
   Said Hass, ``Only mergers or acquisitions that make economic
sense are going to prevail.''

   Ten years ago, its holdings included 600,000
acres of timberland, 425 music stores, 50,000 employees and $1.6
billion in machinery used to make Dixie cups, paper towels and the
packages used to hold toothpaste, beer and frozen foods.
   Today, it has 484 loan offices, 270,000 credit card accounts,
190,000 life insurance agents and 35,000 representatives registered
to sell mutual funds.
   If any one company exemplifies what happened to business in the
1980s, it may be Primerica Corp., the former American Can Co.,
which in the decade transformed itself from manufacturing to
financial services.
   While some differ on the wisdom of the trend, economists agree
the 1980s were a time when the economy's shift from manufacturing
to services accelerated.
   From 1979 to 1987, the number of jobs in manufacturing dropped
from 21 million to 19 million, while jobs in the service sector
grew from 63 million to 77 million, according to statistics from
the U.S. Census Bureau.
   Manufacturing's share of the gross national product fell from
22.5 percent in 1979 to 20.8 percent in 1985, according to a 1989
study by Lawrence R. Mishel, research director at the Economic
Policy Institute in Washington.
   American Can was formed at the turn of the century from 123
small canning firms and can manufacturers. Business prospered
through the 1950s, as a growing number of manufacturers sought
packaging for everything from tomato paste to tennis balls.
   When growth began to slow in the 1950s, American Can diversified
by moving into paper products, printing and various recycling
businesses. In the 1970s, it moved into retailing, buying outfits
like Musicland record stores and the Fingerhut mail-order house.
   The big move into financial services came in the 1980s. It began
in 1982 when American Can bought Associated Madison Cos. Inc., a
life insurance holding company, for $127 million. Associated's
chairman, financial whiz Gerald Tsai Jr., came on board to engineer
the transformation into financial services, an industry he saw as
fragmented and leaning toward deregulation.
   American Can spent the next several years buying more than $1
billion worth of insurance and other financial businesses and
selling off paper and packaging operations and all its retail
interests except for Fingerhut.
   As the American economy boomed in the mid-1980s, so did the
transformed American Can. In 1987, for the third straight year, the
company's insurance lines sold more life insurance than any other
U.S. group. Revenues from financial services grew. Net income
almost doubled from 1983 to 1986.
   By then, financial services accounted for more than 70 percent
of the company's profits.
   American Can changed its name to Primerica on April 28, 1987.
One month later, it added frosting to the cake, spending $750
million to buy Smith Barney, the esteemed old Wall Street firm.
   The move seemed smart until five months later, when the stock
market crashed. As Wall Street stumbled, so did Primerica, whose
net income dropped. Smith Barney had pretax losses of $93 million
in 1987 and $53 million in 1988.
   ``I remember thinking this was not going to be very good for the
old Primerica because they just bought Smith Barney,'' said Sanford
J. Weill, now Primerica's chairman. ``It turned out to happen at a
wrong time. Smith Barney didn't do well for a year and a half.''
   But, like the market, Primerica was far from sunk. In December
1988, it was bought by Commercial Credit Group Inc. Weill, as
chairman of Commercial Credit, took over from Tsai and is presiding
in new Manhattan headquarters as the company tries to become a
force in financial services.
   Just this year, Primerica announced that its Commercial Credit
was buying the branch offices and loan portfolio of Barclays
American-Financial for $1.35 billion. The purchase is expected to
strengthen Commercial Credit's position as one of the country's
major consumer and home-equity lenders.
   Not all is perfect in Primerica's future. One of the same
question marks that faces the American economy entering the 1990s
also faces the company: the financial markets' continuing
volatility, seen in the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average on Oct. 13.
   ``That kind of volatility, when it comes so fast with no notice,
people say, `Is this really a safe place to put our money?''' Weill
said. ``I think we have a real job to do to get the individual to
believe in investing in equities again in this country.''
   But Weill remains optimistic that financial services is a good
place to be in the 1990s. If troubles affect Smith Barney,
Primerica can still count on earnings from its commercial credit
and life insurance businesses, he said.

   In 1980, Campeau Corp. was a Canadian developer
virtually unknown in the United States. Then it went on a spending
spree fed by junk bonds and ended up owning many major U.S.
department store chains.
   Today, Campeau can't pay debts and has been forced to put its
prized Bloomingdale's on the block.
   Ten years ago, the federal deficit stood at $663.6 billion, and
many thought it a disgrace the nation was living beyond its means.
Then the deficit ballooned out of control during the Reagan years,
quadrupling to $2.8 trillion today.
   About 200,000 Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 1979.
By last year the figure topped 540,000 after a credit-card binge
that led one bank to issue plastic to children.
   The 1980s was the decade of debt. Junk bonds, gold cards,
leveraged buyouts, deficit spending _ all became standards of the
age as companies, consumers and the government loaded up with
borrowed money as never before.
   ``This certainly will be the decade that America exploded in
debt,'' said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for the economic
consulting firm DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.
   ``Leverage is a word that may be forever linked with the
1980s,'' added John Lonski, senior economist with Moody's Investors
Service Inc.
   Corporate debt nearly tripled, from $774 billion at the start of
1980 to more than $2 trillion as the decade closed.
   Much of that is due to a takeover and buyout frenzy that
reshaped corporate America and left many industrial titans
teetering atop mountains of IOUs.
   High-risk, high-yield securities, labeled ``junk'' bonds,
ushered in the dominance of debt as a way for corporations to raise
cash, pushing the old standby of stock offerings into the
background.
   Junk bonds made possible such megadeals as the record $25
billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. They also led to the
downfall of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its chief junk-bond
trader, Michael Milken.
   Debt in the 1980s also became a way for corporations to avoid
the clutches of takeover artists. By loading themselves up with
debt obligations through selling bonds, companies made themselves
less appealing targets and made their shareholders happy with
special dividends.
   While Milken and other dealmakers praised the power of debt to
squeeze efficiency out of bloated old-line corporations, the debt
binge inspired doomsday scenarios in the minds of others.
   Some economists predict that corporate America will be deeply
scarred by a recession. A wave of bankruptcies, plant closings and
layoffs could be the price of the all the borrowing, they warn,
when leaner economic times make it difficult to pay bondholders.
   But others, such as Brinner, are less pessimistic, and say only
the most highly leveraged companies would collapse.
   Many economists say the broader question about the nation's debt
binge is whether the borrowed money was wisely spent.
   When it was used to improve plants and machinery, to introduce
new products and to build bridges, schools and highways, it was a
good investment. But when it was used by corporate financiers to
``churn'' money by taking companies private, selling parts of them
and then going public again, there was little or no benefit to the
economy, these economists argue.
   Brinner said he is particularly troubled by the federal deficit,
which he calls ``a disease that is going to weaken us for years.''
   The federal debt ``is going to reduce our standard of living by
about a quarter of a percent a year,'' Brinner said. ``We borrowed
this money not to finance expansion but to finance consumption.''
   Household debt mushroomed from $1.31 trillion at the start of
the decade to about $3.27 trillion as of this June, according to
Moody's. About two-thirds of that debt represents mortgages, while
the rest is credit-card and other personal borrowing.
   While junk bonds and leveraged buyouts stole the spotlight,
banks and financial houses learned new tricks with other forms of
debt during the 1980s, such as repackaging loan and credit-card
portfolios into bonds that were sold to the public.
   The decade also saw the explosive growth of mortgage-backed
bonds from Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, three
government-created entities that buy mortgages from savings and
loans and repackage them as bonds. Wall Street firms earned huge
profits dealing in these issues.
   As the '80s came to a close there were signs that the national
borrowing binge was losing steam.
   Credit-card spending by consumers appeared to slow as it lost
its tax-deductibility under the 1986 tax code revision. Federal
deficit spending was reined in by the Gramm-Rudman law. The
junk-bond market skidded as some of the LBOs of the 1980s became
unglued.
   But the years of deficit spending will take many more years to
be paid off _ if they ever are. Some say the United States already
is paying for its live-for-today attitude, which has been blamed
for a dearth of research and development investment and a decline
in the nation's technological edge.

<HEAD>Buyouts, Shift from Industrial Pursuits Changed Face of Fortune 500</HEAD>

   Levi Strauss disappeared from industrial
America's best-known roster, sold in a management buyout.
   Lone Star Industries became too small to qualify.
   International Telephone &amp; Telegraph was reclassified and appears
on a separate service company list.
   For a variety of reasons, upwards of one-third of the companies
included at the end of the 1970s on the Fortune 500 ranking of the
nation's biggest industrial concerns were missing from the same
list a decade later.
   The buyout wave of the 1980s was a major factor in the sweeping
changes in the Fortune 500 list. Combined sales rose 66 percent to
more than $2 trillion.
   Levi Strauss, which was No. 177 on the list published in 1979,
last appeared among the Fortune 500 in 1985 after which it was sold
to management.
   Continental Oil, which ranked a lofty 18th on the 1979 list,
changed its name that year to Conoco, then vanished from the list
after DuPont Co. acquired it in 1981.
   The flip side of the buyout wave has been that buyers generally
moved up the list. DuPont was ranked ninth in 1989, up from No. 16
a decade earlier.
   Making an even bigger move was Philip Morris Companies Inc., the
cigarette manufacturer ranked 10th in 1989 and 46th in 1979. It
bought General Foods, which was 41st in 1979, and Kraft, which was
39th, during the 1980s.
   Some companies dropped off the list, meanwhile, because they
sold assets or failed to grow fast enough.
   Lone Star Industries, which sold assets over the decade, was No.
248 in 1979 and last appeared in 1987.
   Another big factor in the changes was an increasing emphasis on
service businesses. Companies must derive at least 50 percent of
their sales from manufacturing or mining to qualify for the
magazine's industrial rankings; otherwise they are eligible for
Fortune's Service 500.
   That caused companies like ITT, ranked 11th on the 1979
industrial list, to be moved to the list of diversified service
companies in 1988.
   Other prominent companies reclassified as service concerns
during the 1980s included Gulf &amp; Western Industries, ranked 58th on
the industrial list in 1979 and now known as Paramount Pictures
Inc., and American Can, which was 66th in 1979 and is now called
Primerica.
   The top of the Fortune 500 industrial listing has been fairly
stable despite the exodus of companies lower down.
   Eight of the Top 10 in 1979 were still there in 1989.
   The dropouts are Standard Oil of California, now known as
Chevron, and Gulf Oil, which was acquired by Chevron in 1984.
Standard Oil had been No. 6 in 1979 and Gulf Oil was ninth. Chevron
ranks 11th on the 1989 list.
   They were replaced by the acquisitive DuPont and Philip Morris.
   General Motors led the 1979 list with $63.2 billion in sales and
remained at the top in 1989 with nearly twice as much _ $121.1
billion.
   The 500th company in 1979 moved halfway up the ladder,
reflecting computer industry growth in the Money Decade.
   Data General was 500th in 1979 with sales of $379.9 million and
No. 272 in 1989 with sales of $1.36 billion.

<HEAD>Rolling Recession Raises Some Ships, Swamps Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The longest peacetime expansion in history. The
oft-repeated phrase rings hollow in the oil patch, where the
optimism of the early '80s dissolved to depression following the
OPEC-induced collapse of the energy markets.
   Ditto in the Midwest, which became known as the Rust Bowl. And
on the Plains, where farmers suffered through drought and
foreclosure.
   And perhaps in the Northeast, where analysts now see recession.
   Not everybody has enjoyed 84 straight months of Good Times.
   ``Overall, when you look at the macro numbers, it looks pretty
good, (but) there have been all sorts of people who have
suffered,'' said Edward Yardeni, the Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. economist who identified the concept of a rolling recession,
which strikes different spots at different times.
   ``Try going into a bar in Pittsburgh in 1984, '85 or '86 and
telling the steelworkers we haven't had a recession, they'd toss
you out on your ear,'' said Yardeni.
   ``If we can continue to have these rolling recessions _ knock
some sense into all of us but one at a time instead of all at
once,'' then the nation as a whole is better off, Yardeni believes.
   Manufacturing had its recession in 1985, energy in 1986 and
construction started its downturn at the end of last year, said
Donald Ratajczak, head of the Economic Forecasting Project at
Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   ``But none of them did it at the same time,'' he said. ``The
Southwest is just now starting to get its head above water, while
the darlings of the early '80s _ the Northeast and New England, are
just beginning to slip (and) there are signs out West that their
housing market has overdone it.''
   The rolling recession churns on.
   ``Many states that were winners since 1985 could turn out to be
losers as the new decade begins,'' said Stephen P.A. Brown, senior
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ``In some regions
the reversal already has begun.''
   The party may be over in the Northeast.
   ``It already is the problem area,'' said Sara Johnson, managing
economist for DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``The
Northeast has experienced the slowest growth among all regions.
We're saying the Northeast is in a recession.''
   Speculative overbuilding and weakness in the computer industry
have led to the decline, she said.
   A report by financial industry consultant Alex Sheshunoff
recently warned of weakening banks in the Northeast as the
overbuilding begins to take a toll, just as it did in the Southwest.
   But whatever the Northeast's problems, they won't approach the
Southwest's of the last few years.
   When the 1980s opened, the Southwest was basking in expectations
of $50-a-barrel oil while the rest of the country still was
struggling.
   When Northeasterners complained about the high price of oil,
Texans responded with bumper stickers saying, ``Let 'em freeze in
the dark.''
   Credit was there for the asking; new office buildings sprouted
like the state's prized wildflowers. ``Dallas,'' the prime-time
soap opera, flaunted the Texas high life and became one of the most
popular shows on television.
   Then the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began
pumping more oil and prices fell to just over $10 a barrel, too low
to be profitable in the U.S. oilfields.
   Bankruptcy became common. Unemployment exceeded 10 percent. Real
estate agents took second jobs as hotel night clerks. The collapse
soon dragged down the state's largest banks, forcing the federal
government to come to the rescue. The more loosely regulated thrift
industry, with problems exacerbated by fraud and shadowy dealing,
became an embarrassment.
   The long-ignored concept of diversification became dominant, and
the state began paying attention to education and industrial
recruitment, ``because if we can't rely on God's gifts, we have to
create our own gifts,'' said economist Tom Fomby at Southern
Methodist University.
   Texas successfully has turned to high technology, wooing two
computer consortiums to the capital, Austin. Richardson, a suburb
of Dallas, now bills itself as the Telecom Corridor based on the
presence of Northern Telecom's main U.S. research center, plus the
coming of large operations for MCI and Fujitsu.
   While the Southwest is only now recovering, ``the Southeast
hasn't taken a recession in this decade,'' Georgia State's
Ratajczak said. ``Parts of the Southeast stumbled a bit ... when
manufacturing was stumbling, but there was enough strength in the
cities with the movement towards the services that overcame all the
mill towns shutting down.''
   Although the Southeast has been in the lead, DRI's Ms. Johnson
says it will ``slip into second behind the Pacific Southwest'' as
employment and population gains slow and defense cutbacks are felt
in several states.
   ``The Pacific regions have capitalized on the export boom and
will continue to do so,'' she said. ``The economy is
well-diversified with a nice mix of high tech, finance and
services. Population continues to drift toward that region.''
   The Midwest, meanwhile, may be starting a comeback, says
Prudential-Bache's Yardeni.
   ``One of the buzzwords of the 1980s was the Rust Bowl, the
de-industrialization of America, and this was focused on the
Midwest,'' Yardeni said. ``As it turned out, these forecasts of the
death of American industry were unwarranted. It did restructure,
did cut some excess capacity and by 1987 it was clear that we were
coming out of the mid-cycle industrial recession very nicely.''
   Meanwhile, the prospects for agriculture have improved, helped
partly by the recent political changes in the Communist bloc.
   ``Look at all the Russians and East Europeans we're going to
have to feed,'' Yardeni said.

   Consumers bingedin the 1980s, indulging
themselves with everything from fancy gourmet foods to electronic
gadgets and luxury vacations.
   Now, on the cusp of a new decade, consumers bloated with debt
are sobering up.
   The U.S. marketplace bore the full weight of the postwar baby
boom during the '80s. Many grown-up boomers ignored the example set
by thrifty parents and spent liberally, helping to fuel the longest
peacetime economic expansion in American history.
   They were helped in their pursuit of consumer happiness by some
fortuitous economic events.
   Inflation was tamed in the early part of the decade by the
Federal Reserve's tight money policies, and the prime lending rate,
which had peaked at 21.5 percent in December 1980, fell closer to
10 percent by late 1982.
   A big income tax cut was engineered by President Reagan. A bull
market on Wall Street kicked up piles of money for lucky investors.
A strong dollar made imported goods, like Japanese electronics and
German automobiles, the standards by which all good, consuming
Americans were measured.
   ``People went shopping like crazy. We were on a spending binge
in the 1980s,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures
Group in Washington. ``For most of the decade Americans were spared
the pair of miseries that plagued the 1970s and early '80s: rampant
food and fuel inflation.''
   Advertising jingles proclaiming ``You deserve a break today'' or
asking cheekily ``Who says you can't have it all?'' summarized the
spendthrift mentality of yuppies, the buzzword for young, urban
professionals.
   ``They were not into postponed gratification,'' said
Florida-based consultant Carol Farmer.
   Yuppies embodied '80s-style conspicuous consumption. Although
representing less than an estimated 5 percent of the 76 million
Americans born between 1946 and '64, they were the vanguard of the
baby-boom generation, setting trends in consumer behavior.
   More consumers than ever before were armed with credit cards and
carried the buy-now, pay-later concept to the limit.
   Over 606 million charge cards of all kinds, including ones
offered by retailers, were held by Americans at the end of 1988, up
from 380 million in 1979, according to figures compiled by the
Bankcard Holders of America, a nonprofit group.
   Leo J. Shapiro, whose Chicago-based market research firm tracks
trends, said shopping habits changed drastically during the decade.
Dual-income families had no room for ``chief shoppers,'' whose main
mission in life is keeping cupboards from going bare and keeping
house.
   The result was more individuals shopping for themselves, giving
rise to specialty retailers, each supplying specific types of
merchandise. These niche merchants are expected to thrive in the
'90s, Shapiro said.
   Trend spotter Faith Popcorn of the marketing consulting firm
Brain Reserve Inc. said consumers seemed obsessed with props during
the '80s, things that made them look good or helped project a
certain image.
   The principal consequence of all this spending was an
accumulation of debt and an accompanying decline in savings.
   The savings rate, measured as a percentage of spendable personal
income, sank to some unusually low depths in the '80s: 3.2 percent
in 1987, compared with an average between 6.5 percent and 7 percent
in the three prior decades.
   The economy in general looks a lot different than it did when
the boom began. The tax cut left behind a big budget deficit. The
flood of imports threw the trade balance out of whack. Inflation,
spurred along by aggressive spending, poses a new threat.
   Against the backdrop of impending hard times, consumer tastes
are beginning to change, shifting away from extravagance toward
practicality, the experts believe.
   Furniture, not fast cars, and home computers, not glitzy
trinkets, will be the people's choice of the '90s. With a larger
share of baby-boomers coping with the responsibility and expense of
child rearing, purchases will be more sensible, predicts Ms.
Popcorn, the marketing consultant.
   ``The 1980s were for show and the 1990s are for go, in terms of
where is it going to get me in the future,'' Ms. Popcorn said.
   Shapiro thinks of it as a shift away from abundance toward the
``precious,'' which he describes as an intense enjoyment of the
things you have rather than simple gluttony.
   Even if belts are tightened a few notches, consumers will remain
a driving force of economic activity. But their power may be
channeled in different directions or diminished as the economy
matures and sorts out imbalances, particularly in foreign trade.
   ``In the 1980s we were consuming more than we produced at
home,'' Ms. Shaber said. ``Final demand in the United States was
greater than domestic production. To close the gap, we have to do
the reverse.''

   The Tracker is one of those vehicles that could
have existed only in the 1980s: designed in Japan, built in Canada
by a U.S.-Japanese partnership and sold in the United States.
   Did that make it Japanese, Canadian, or maybe American, since it
was sold in Chevrolet showrooms? Its producers avoided the issue by
calling it a Geo, from the Greek word for Earth.
   For the U.S. auto industry, it was a confusing, sometimes
difficult and above all blurry decade.
   Blurriest were the definitions of what was an imported car.
Scenes of angry men battering a Toyota with sledgehammers faded
into scenes of happy Japanese and American autoworkers toiling
together on assembly plant teams.
   People weren't even sure what it was the companies were making.
The Nissan Pathfinder was classified as a car by the Treasury
Department and a truck by the Transportation Department.
   As for attitudes toward the Japanese, just ask Bob McCurry,
executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc.
   ``Most of the prejudices have gone away,'' he said, ``but I
still have some relatives where they haven't.''
   The auto industry was touched, like many others, by
acquisitions, joint ventures and takeovers. As in other industries,
the Japanese influence shifted into high gear.
   Proud American automakers, industrial pillars of the West,
struggled to halt their loss of market share to competitors from
across the Pacific by forming joint ventures with Japanese
companies and imitating Japan's manufacturing and labor management.
   The Tracker typifies the partnership trend. The small
sport-utility vehicle was designed by Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. of
Japan. It's built in Canada at a factory owned by Suzuki and
General Motors Corp. It's sold through U.S. Chevrolet dealers and
carries the Geo nameplate.
   For another example, a Mazda Motor Corp. plant in Flat Rock,
Mich., produces cars for Ford Motor Co.
   ``The Japanese certainly have provided a goad and it has been a
chance for us to learn some very good things that we have learned
to apply,'' Ford Chairman Donald Petersen said in a recent
interview.
   Each of the Big Three battled back to profitability during the
decade through new products, cost-cutting, union concessions and
government protection from imports.
   Chrysler's case was the most widely publicized. In 1980, the
federal government guaranteed loans to refloat the sinking
automaker. The corporation paid off the loans seven years early.
   ``We began the decade of the '80s by taking one risk that ran
against some of the most deeply ingrained economic ideals we hold
in this country and it was a huge success,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca said in a recent speech.
   Ford lost $1.54 billion in 1980 but it turned into the most
profitable automaker in history just eight years later when it
reported a $5.3 billion profit. GM began an ``Action Plan'' that
has a target of trimming $13 billion from its costs.
   Instead of reinvesting all their profits, the Big Three hedged
their bets by going into other businesses.
   General Motors Corp. acquired Electronic Data Systems Inc. in
October 1984 and Hughes Electronics Inc. in June 1985.
   Ford got into the banking business in December 1985 when it
acquired San Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank, which has
become the nation's second-largest savings and loan institution.
   Chrysler Corp. bought Gulfstream Aerospace in August 1985, two
years before it purchased American Motors Corp.
   Chrysler, for one, later decided it was spreading itself too
thin. Late in 1989, it announced plans to sell Gulfstream Aerospace
and its military electronics business to ``concentrate resources on
core car and truck operations.''
   Another ploy of the automakers had an unintended side effect.
The Big Three managed to obtain ``voluntary'' restraints on
Japanese imports, but that only drove the Japanese into building
plants in the United States. Those plants made cars even more
cheaply than the ones in Japan.
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. spearheaded the Japanese manufacturing
assault on American soil when it began making Civics in Marysville,
Ohio, in November 1982. Since then, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda,
Mitsubishi, Subaru, Isuzu and Hyundai have set up assembly plants
either independently or in a joint venture with one of the Big
Three automakers.
   Those plants are adding to big problems for the industry as the
1990s get under way _ overcapacity and the potential for layoffs.
   The overcapacity that emerged in the 1980s seems certain to
worsen in the 1990s. The plants forced to close most likely won't
be the new Japanese-owned ones in white-dominated,
``right-to-work'' places like rural Tennessee and Kentucky. They'll
be the aging Big Three plants, mostly located in union strongholds
and employing a disproportionate share of minority workers.
   Under pressure from Japan, membership in the United Auto Workers
union dropped during the decade from about 1.5 million to just
under 1 million.
   While many things got blurry in the 1980s, the outlook for
old-line autoworkers became starkly clear.

<HEAD>Weekly Rig Count Posts Decrease of Four</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
declined slightly this week, dropping by four to a total of 1,058.
   This week's decline follows a 25-rig increase that boosted the
count last week to 1,062. That increase had reversed a two-week
decline.
   The latest rig count, compiled by Baker Hughes Inc. and reported
Monday, is 136 ahead of a year ago.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana gained seven rigs,
Texas was up by three, Oklahoma and North Dakota each gained two
and California's count increased by one.
   Colorado lost seven rigs, New Mexico was down by four, Wyoming
lost three and Kansas's count declined by two. The rig totals in
Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania were unchanged.

   For a lesson in how the investment picture
changed in 1980s, ask the Hunt Brothers of Texas.
   The former billionaires, who made a fortune in oil, tried to
cash in on the meteoric rise of silver and other precious metals of
the inflationary '70s and wound up losing their Rolex watches as
the '80s rolled in and silver prices tumbled.
   ``There was a lot of pessimism around when Carter was president
and the Soviet Union was invading Afghanistan,'' noted Edward
Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``As
the decade progressed I was much more optimistic.''
   Political instability, heavy government regulation and high
taxes and inflation, almost household words in the '70s,
disappeared these past 10 years. The nation embarked on the longest
peactime economic expansion ever.
   Financial assets, such as stocks, bonds or Treasury bills,
flourished. So-called tangible, or ``real'' assets, including
silver, gold, oil or farmland, gave up some of their gains of the
previous decade, although noted exceptions were in some artwork and
collectibles.
   A recent study by the New York securities firm Salomon Brothers
Inc. found that stocks averaged a 17 percent return during the '80s
_ about twice the historical norm _ making them the No. 1
investment performers despite the 1987 stock market crash.
   Coins came in second with a 12.9 percent return; followed by
bonds, 10.9 percent, and Treasury bills, 10 percent.
   In the cellar were silver, with a 4.6 percent loss, and
farmland, which lost 0.5 percent, the study said. Other poor
performers were foreign exchange investments, which gained less
than 1 percent due largely to the dollar's volatility; oil, which
gained 1.2 percent; and gold, 2.8 percent.
   By comparison the inflation rate averaged 5.7 percent during the
decade.
   Many experts believe stocks and bonds will continue to perform
well in the early 1990s. But as Yardeni warns: ``Anytime you have
such extraordinary returns in an asset in a 10-year period it's
time to think of something else.''
   Some experts see potential investment opportunities in Europe,
particularly among Eastern-bloc countries, where rapid political
and economic reforms are occurring. Others say regional real
estate, which bottomed out in areas like Texas or the Rockies, is
destined for a turnaround.
   Still, for Tom O'Hara, who invests as a hobby, the bull stock
market has been a boon for his Mutual Investment Club of Detroit,
which he helped start with friends five decades ago. ``From 1980 to
now has been fabulous,'' he said. The club's portfolio, which
includes a variety of stocks, grew threefold in the 1980s to a high
of $2 million. By contrast, the club's porfolio rose by 41 percent
in all of the previous decade.
   Michael Stein, a financial planner with Brownson Rehmus &amp;
Foxworth in Chicago, said clients who came out on top in the '80s
undoubtedly were enrolled in a company stock ownership plan.
   But diversification also was the key in dealing with financial
assets, Stein said.
   Not all stock funds performed well. Those who took the
conservative approach, sticking with typical passbook savings
accounts or certificates of deposits, didn't do well when interest
rates were low, generally in the mid-1980s. When stock prices
crashed, however, the safety offered by fixed-income products was a
blessing for many.
   ``Also, it made a difference how actively you traded your
portfolio,'' Stein said. ``Those who held onto the same portfolio
with virtually no changes probably ended up with a greater return
than those who made changes and had to pay brokerage fees and
commissions and taxes.''
   Investors were preoccupied with taxes during the '70s and early
'80s, and investments designed to shelter more income from Uncle
Sam were popular until tax laws were reformed late in the decade.
   ``A lot of the money in the early '80s went to tax-motivated
ventures,'' said Jay Goldinger, who runs the Beverly Hills, Calif.,
investment firm Capital Insight Inc. ``I remember driving down the
coast of California and seeing all these windmills. There used to
be tax benefits for energy conservation.''
   Perhaps one of the more notable changes in the '80s was that
Americans became more Wall-Steet wise, partly because many families
had more discretionary income to invest.
   ``Women began to really move in droves into the work force,''
said Hank Madden, a financial planner in the Jacksonville, Fla.,
office of IDS Financial Services Inc. ``A lot of lower-income
families were elevated to middle-class families.''

   The Money Decade of the 1980s brought both heady
success and egregious excess to Wall Street.
   The securities markets returned the favor by taking a hand in
setting the economic and political course of the decade for
American society.
   Stock traders celebrated the ascendance of deregulation,
technology and global investing with a historic bull market that
began in the summer of 1982 and reached new highs as late as the
autumn of 1989.
   ``It has been a very unusual bull market _ the longest we have
ever had in peacetime,'' said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., a veteran
analyst at the firm of Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
   It outlasted several prominent participants, who by the end of
the decade were serving prison terms or banished from the business
for their parts in a series of scandals.
   In the ultimate test of its staying power, the bull market
survived the worst market drop in more than half a century _ the
crash of 1987 that culminated in Black Monday on Oct. 19 of that
year.
   Wall Street in the '80s was unfailingly controversial as well.
While the bull market signaled a seven-year period of economic
expansion that was welcomed by many business managers and
consumers, it was assailed by social critics as the emblem of an
age of materialism.
   Many Wall Streeters themselves decried the new computerized
trading techniques it helped spawn _ strategies like index
arbitrage and portfolio insurance that collectively came under the
label ``program trading.''
   Worst of all, said some, the boom on Wall Street was financed in
large part by a mountain of debt that might someday collapse with
devastating consequences.
   Still, with all their blemishes, the 1980s lived up to their
billing on the Street as ``the decade of financial assets.''
   Gone were the bouts of rapid inflation and rapidly rising
interest rates that depressed paper investments in the 1970s,
elevating in their place tangible assets such as gold and
collectibles.
   Stocks and bonds were back in favor as a way to participate in
the growth and resilience of the American economy.
   As they recovered their strength, the stock and bond markets
flexed their muscles, playing a newly prominent role in the shaping
of government policies affecting the economy.
   At the beginning of the 1980s, it was the bond market's turn to
play ``vigilante,'' acting as a kind of self-appointed surrogate
for the Federal Reserve by increasing interest rates each time its
traders sensed a new stirring of inflation.
   By the time of the 1987 crash, the stock market also had emerged
as a vigilante force, impelling central bankers to ease up on
credit conditions whenever it felt the threat of recession.
   The new breed of financial vigilante was quick to strike,
sending the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials down a record 508
points on Black Monday in 1987, and administering another 190-point
beating nearly two years later, on Oct. 13, 1989.
   Despite those rude interruptions, the net results for the decade
showed emphatic advances. The Dow Jones industrials, which started
the 1980s at 838.74, hovered near 2,700 in the waning weeks of the
decade.
   That kind of performance won't be easy to match in the 1990s.
For the average to triple again, it would have to climb past 8,000.
   Some observers see reason to hope for more good news. The
nation's labor force is likely to grow more slowly in the 1990s,
putting pressure on business to invest in greater amounts of
productivity-enhancing equipment, says Richard Peterson, chief
economist at Chicago's Continental Bank.
   ``The net effect of increasing investment in business equipment
will be a pattern of steady economic expansion through the 1990s,''
Peterson asserts.
   Nevertheless, many analysts wonder whether more unpleasant
shocks await a generation that grew up with the image of Wall
Street as inexhaustible horn of plenty.
   As DeVoe put it: ``An awful lot of people are being seduced to
the idea that we're never going to have another bear market again.''

<HEAD>Personal Computers Went Hand-in-Hand With Capitalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Diebold was in Paris in the late 1950s
talking about computers when a Russian stood up in the back of the
room and said computers were exactly what his country needed.
   Large computers would finally enable Soviet leaders to control
their economy according to plan, the Russian said.
   Don't be so sure, Diebold told the man. Computers can do a lot,
but they can't run an entire economy. Nothing can. Things are too
complex.
   That meeting in Paris more than 30 years ago foreshadowed two of
the most powerful developments of the 1980s: the rise of the
personal computer and the decline of centrally planned economies.
   Western democracies prospered in the '80s because power was in
the hands of the people. Personal computers helped by breaking the
tyranny of the corporate data center, where men in white coats had
doled out information to supplicants.
   Moscow's commissars feared personal computers as much as
printing presses. Their central computers were busy churning out
five-year plans. It didn't work for producing steel, and it worked
even less for producing ideas, the currency of the knowledge
economy that emerged in the '80s.
   ``They always thought that if they just got one more level of
sophistication in their equations, and in their models, that would
make the whole thing work. It didn't,'' said Diebold, a New
York-based consultant.
   Apple Computer Inc. recognized the personal computer's
revolutionary potential in a January 1984 commercial of a female
athlete throwing a mallet through an image of Big Brother.
   In the flash of the exploding screen, Apple announced the
Macintosh and promised, ``You'll see why 1984 won't be like
`1984.'''
   The personal computer was a phenomenon of the 1980s.
   While the pple II appeared in 1977, PCs didn't become a force in
the business world until IBM rolled out its first model in 1981.
After that, things happened quickly.
   In 1982, Lotus Development Corp. introduced 1-2-3, the
electronic spreadsheet that gave many people a reason to buy their
first computer. Compaq Computer Corp. introduced its first IBM
clone that year, and rose to the Fortune 500 faster than any
company in history.
   1984 was the year of the Macintosh as well as the first personal
computers from newly split-up AT&amp;T. In 1985, co-founder Steve Jobs
resigned from Apple. In 1987, IBM tried to distance itself from the
clone-makers with its Personal System-2 line. In 1989, Jobs
introduced a black magnesium cube of a workstation that he called
the ``Next.''
   PCs were the great levelers in the '80s. They let little guys
compete for business with big guys. Owners of PCs could dig facts
out of databases, analyze them and assemble them into
professional-looking documents _ all from a storefront office or a
corner of the bedroom.
   The leveling happened within the computer industry itself.
   For IBM, PCs threatened the fat profit margins it made on
minicomputers and mainframes.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. found that all the resources
of Bell Laboratories could not guarantee it success in the
fast-moving PC industry. In 1989, it ran ads portraying itself as a
David to the Goliath of Compaq _ a company not even founded a
decade earlier.
   The United States invented personal computers and used them in
the '80s more than any other nation, perhaps a reflection of the
go-it-alone spirit of Americans.
   Americans dominated production of PCs as well, but that may not
last for long. Japan gained control of most chips, screens and
other components and attained a solid position in laptop computers,
the fastest-growing portion of the market.
   Whether or not Japan takes over the PC industry in the '90s, the
critical issue will be which company, and which nation, uses
computers most intelligently.
   The wrong way is mindless number-crunching, which was all too
common in the '80s.
   ``You got a lot of people showing very elegant sets of figures
all worked out in great plans, but with the same sorts of lack of
judgment you would have had without the computer,'' said Diebold.
   To change that, personal computers in the '90s must be machines
for ideas, argues Marsh Fisher, an entrepreneur in Irvine, Calif.
   Society must learn to raise ideas as methodically as it raises
wheat, Fisher argues. He has sold Walt Disney Co. and others on a
program called IdeaFisher that prods people into making odd but
fruitful mental associations.
   ``The computer's been crunching numbers and word-processing very
neatly for a lot of years,'' Fisher said. ``Now we've got to move
it into expanding our mind.''
   That agenda is a natural for the American-born personal
computer. It is definitely not what the Russian in Paris had in
mind.

<HEAD>Products of '80s Stressed Convenience, Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Product makers in the 1980s let people have what
they wanted, even if it meant admitting a mistake.
   The revival of old Coke by popular demand told the story of the
decade. Consumers were masters of the economic universe and they
got exactly what they desired, from fax machines to oat bran.
   Convenience and specialization were hallmarks of '80s products.
   Microwave ovens had been available before the decade started,
but their popularity zoomed in the '80s as lower prices and more
compact construction helped make them indispensable fixtures in
American kitchens.
   Judith Langer, who heads her own New York-based market research
firm, said the machine eased the guilt some homemakers felt about
pursuing interests outside the home. The kids could easily fix
their own hot meals.
   Coca-Cola Co. upset some customers by changing the formula for
its flagship drink in 1985. The company said it listened to
consumer complaints and brought back the original as Coca-Cola
Classic three months later. The old standby soon regained status as
the best-selling soft drink, leaving analysts to wonder whether it
was all a publicity stunt.
   While the microwave oven made it easier to leave home, the 1980s
offered other products for those who didn't necessarily want to go
to the office.
   From the Timex Sinclair 1000 personal computer that debuted in
the early part of the decade through generations of IBM and Apple
models and the Compaq laptop, people had the tools to keep up and
figure things out for themselves at home.
   The trend toward self-sufficiency was accelerated with the
proliferation of cellular telephones and personal facsimile
machines.
   Well over half of American homes installed videocassette
recorders, giving people the freedom to do what they wanted and
still catch their favorite movies or programs on their terms.
Forget to set the timer? You can tune in the portable Sony Watchman
TV.
   Gannett Co. Inc. launched its national newspaper, USA Today, in
the 1980s and its colorful graphics and concise writing style
influenced other papers.
   In television, the mass media came under assault as cable
networks emerged and others went after narrow audiences. Rock music
fans got their MTV and the Financial News Network was launched.
Home shopping channels also debuted, peddling jewelry, porcelain
dolls and gadgets around the clock.
   Dozens of new financial products appeared in the 1980s,
including zero-coupon bonds, securities backed by payments on car
loans, bank money market accounts and futures trading based on
stock indexes.
   On the highways, Chrysler Corp. introduced minivans, cars like
Chevy Camaro and Pontiac Firebird livened up the dowdy state of
auto design and convertibles made a comback. But the gull-winged
DeLorean failed to fly (except in the movies), and the Yugo from
Eastern Europe quickly ran out of gas.
   California Coolers started a rush to concocting alcoholic
beverages for the adults who grew up on fizzy drinks, but the rage
soon went flat. Anheuser-Busch Cos. introduced LA, a low-alcohol
beer that has lagged despite the trend toward moderation and health.
   The health craze created the environment for $100 sneakers from
Nike and Reebok and a revival of demand for oatmeal with its
reputed cholesterol-lowering abilities.
   If the 1980s left you stressed, you could take some consolation
from another product of the decade _ the pain reliever ibuprofen
was approved for sale without prescription.

<HEAD>Eight Who Shaped the Business '80s</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan, Volcker, Milken, Pickens, Lorenzo, Iacocca, Morita and
Jobs.
   Of the scores who played leading roles in business and finance
during the decade, these are eight who shaped the '80s.
   When asked to name the great business leaders of the decade,
Associated Press business writers produced a list of more than 30,
including some inanimate objects like the junk bond and one obvious
group, the Japanese.
   But some individuals stood out, their contributions so familiar
that the mere mention of their last names nearly tells their
stories.
   These are eight who set the tone. Eight who personify the most
important themes of the last 10 years _ free markets, corporate
restructuring, economic transformation and global competitiveness.
   Two of the eight, former President Reagan and ex-Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker, orchestrated events at the macroeconomic
level, molding an economy of steady growth and low inflation.
   Michael Milken, T. Boone Pickens and Frank Lorenzo exploited the
times, blazing trails and building fortunes in Reagan's unfettered
marketplace.
   Lee Iacocca and Akio Morita performed business miracles on
opposite ends of the earth and emerged as national as well as
corporate standard-bearers.
   Steve Jobs, as a singular sensation, proved a reassuring
reminder that no matter how much change the 1980s wrought,
individual creativity was still the most valuable commodity for
sale in America.
   Below are brief reflections on the marks these eight left behind:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Reagan and Volcker: Two Most Powerful</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan was dubbed the great communicator, but he was an even
greater deregulator and free enterpriser, who dedicated his
two-term presidency to restoring America's capitalist fervor.
   He will be remembered for his good fortune _ he got a recession
out of the way at the beginning of his tenure _ and for maximizing
his opportunities. In the midst of the downturn, he won approval
for big tax cuts that launched the longest peacetime expansion in
U.S. history.
   He held two economic tenets dear: Taxes should be cut and the
federal bureaucracy should be trimmed. Because he proved a better
tax cutter than program pruner, the Reagan boom created a
burgeoning federal budget deficit that kept interest rates
inordinately high even as the economy expanded.
   Plugging the holes in Reaganomics fell to Volcker, who
controlled the money supply _ and thus interest rates _ with the
perspective of a tortoise to Reagan's hare.
   Where all the president's men saw growth, the apostate Volcker
smelled inflation and resolved to keep a grip on monetary policy
even as Reaganites jawboned for easier credit.
   For his steadfastness, the Fed chairman earned the unofficial
title of ``second most powerful man in America.'' Oddly, Volcker
was never seen as a political threat to the president, perhaps
because his tight-money policies kept the worst excesses of the
Reagan revolution in check.
   Reagan's appeal was founded in his bold pursuit of ideals at the
expense of opposing interests. Executives admired his guts when he
fired the striking air controllers in 1981; labor leaders never
forgave him.
   Volcker, too, was somewhat of an idealist, but he had bitter
medicine for all to swallow, consumers and fat cats alike.
   Volcker put restrictions on business in the form of tight
credit. Reagan dismantled government regulation at every turn.
   Reagan invited all businesses to the party; Volcker and his
inflation-fighting successor, Alan Greenspan, were the designated
drivers.
   Putting an ironic twist on an old Donald Regan saw: Reagan could
not have been Reagan, if Volcker hadn't been Volcker. The
expansion, still intact after seven years, would not have been as
powerful or as enduring without the countervailing forces of
Reagan's whip and Volcker's tug on the reins.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Milken, Pickens, Lorenzo: The New Capitalists</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By reviving laissez faire as a guiding principle of government,
Reagan set the stage for a new brand of capitalist in 1980s.
Government scrutiny was out; wheeling and dealing was in.
   Milken, Pickens and Lorenzo became giants, not by inheritance or
formal succession to the chief executive's office, but by taking
full advantage of the market's new freedoms.
   They didn't develop any new products; they employed old tools to
new ends.
   Milken, a bond trader, took high-risk corporate bonds off the
junk heap and created a $200 billion market for debt financing.
   Pickens, an oilman, showed how to hit gushers in the stock
market by snapping up the shares of companies undervalued in
comparison to their assets.
   Lorenzo, a Harvard MBA with a fascination for flying, assembled
the nation's biggest airline empire under the banner of Texas Air
by buying up deregulated carriers and busting unions.
   Sympathetic biographers would label all three self-made me, but
they were not the sort of cuddly entrepreneurs Americans
instinctively embrace. Indeed their greatest successes prompted
more cocked eyebrows than applause.
   Milken was indicted for securities fraud. Pickens was branded a
``raider.'' Lorenzo, after flying two airlines into bankruptcy and
putting hundreds of union employees out of work, became known as
one of America's toughest bosses.
   As three of the greatest risk-takers of the age, each was
stalked as much as he hunted his own prey. But they were
characteristically unbowed by challenge or criticism.
   Lorenzo, a recent magazine profile noted, survived on the
conviction of his own rightness. So, Milken in the face of his 1990
trial. So, Pickens in his raids, most recently on a Japanese
company.
   Lorenzo's comment when he bought Eastern Airlines in 1986 was
typical of the threesome's sober acceptance of controversy.
   ``There ain't no Santa Claus,'' he told a news conference.

<HEAD>Iacocca and Morita: National Symbols</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Iacocca and Morita were tough guys with a better press. They
attracted enemies, but managed their images with aplomb. As a
result, they became instant national symbols.
   The Chrysler Corp. chairman got a billion-dollar bailout from
the federal government as the decade opened, but paid the debt in
1983, seven years ahead of schedule. To flaunt the extraordinary
payback, he held a lavish press conference where he stood before a
mammoth blowup of a check for $800 million, the company's final
payment.
   His success at Chrysler, after being fired from Ford Motor Co.
in 1978, was as much a personal victory as a corporate one. He
personally sold Congress on the bailout and became the company's
main pitchman for K-cars and minivans in national television
commercials.
   Exposure was his magic wand. When he was fired from the Statue
of Liberty restoration committee in a political snit in 1986, he
wrapped himself in the flag and called the ouster ``un-American.''
Most Iacocca fans agreed.
   Morita, the Sony Corp. chairman, became the Japanese answer to
Iacocca, but with an even tougher PR challenge. Besides selling
himself and his company, he had to sell a whole nation of
aggressive capitalists to skeptical Americans.
   A natural salesman and communicator in the Iacocca mold, Morita
seemed to sense what was needed to salve old postwar sores.
   After Sony bought CBS Records in 1987, he hugged recording star
Cyndi Lauper for a magazine cover photo, symbolically embracing the
culture. When Sony bought Columbia Pictures this fall, he paid
millions to get the services of a pair of American producers, Peter
Guber and Jon Peters, creators of hits ``Batman'' and ``Rain Man.''
   And, of course, Sony kept churning out gizmos for American
consumers. Who could hate a guy bringing a Video Walkman to market
just in time for Christmas?
   Morita was no softy: He frequently criticized short-term
thinking in the United States and co-wrote a book discussing the
``decline of America.'' But when the book provoked a backlash in
Congress, he apologized for promoting nationalistic views.
   The secret to the success of stars like Morita and Iacocca was
their political sensitivity and their mastery of the media. Few
business leaders of the age stood as tall outside the boardroom or
the plant.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jobs: Thirtysomething Entrepreneur</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One man combined popular allure with real genius: Steve Jobs. He
was the American dream updated to the '80s. The garage inventor who
struck it rich. A thirtysomething Horatio Alger.
   In a sense Jobs was the consummate business leader of the
decade. He was young. He invented computers, the machine of the
age. He walked away from a very successful company just to start
another one.
   He built the Apple Computer Inc. empire only to leave it in 1985
after introducing one of the hottest computer boxes of the decade,
the Macintosh. Jobs left the company in a dispute with John
Sculley, a veteran businessman whom Jobs himself had recruited to
help run his growing firm.
   What mattered most to Jobs was not running a company, but
creating hot boxes. His subsequent creation, the product of a few
wizards' work, was appropriately labeled ``Next.''
   His trademark long hair sometimes gave way to a yuppie trim, and
he seemed to enjoy the panache of bow ties and designer suits as
much as his faded blue jeans. But there was no mistaking what he
represented.
   As the rebellious youth beating the old capitalist establishment
at its own game, Jobs provided a fitting symbol for a decade that
followed the '70s.

<HEAD>A Success Story for the '80s: Dayton Hudson's Lauderback</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been 10 years since Brenda Lauderback
hurdled society's gender and racial barriers to win her first
corporate management job with the nation's fifth-largest retailing
company.
   From a retail training program at a Gimbles department store in
Pittsburgh, she arrived at Dayton Hudson Department Store Co. in
Minneapolis in 1975 as a merchandise buyer.
   Five years later, she emerged as the division head for intimate
apparel and has since risen into company officer ranks as the
general manager for shoes, cosmetics, accessories and intimate
apparel _ the first black woman to hold such a post at the $1.7
billion subsidiary of Dayton Hudson Corp.
   ``It showed me that your dreams can become reality and I knew it
was just the beginning,'' Lauderback said of her big promotion in
1980.
   In a decade noted for the pursuit of money, Lauderback is among
the hard-chargers who poured productive energy into the longest
peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. Her career also
stands out among the thousands of women who entered the work force
and moved up the corporate ladder in the '80s.
   Since 1982 Lauderback has consistently met or surpassed sales
goals for her $440 million division, and earlier this year she was
invited to join the Committee of 200 _ an elite national group of
women executives.
   Lauderback and her husband, Dr. Boyd Wright, a St. Paul dentist,
are fixtures in the Twin Cities establishment. They have a
``status'' house in the exclusive suburb of Edina, an investment
professional to help manage their income, a live-in caretaker with
a master's degree in education to nurture their 4-year-old
daughter, Phallon, and plenty of money to vacation.
   If only they had more time.
   Lauderback said she's on the road up to 40 percent of the year,
including trips to Europe and the Orient. Her work week can easily
mount to 60 hours.
   Hence the decision 2{ years ago to hire Lauderback's college
friend, Nancy Bryant, to help care for Phallon.
   ``It was when the pressures were getting real tight,''
Lauderback said. ``She came to help us in managing our family and
our future.''
   Lauderback said the frenzy of meshing her career with motherhood
has prompted some to put her in the category of superwoman. But she
detests the label for the expectations it carries.
   ``I don't want that superwoman cape,'' she said. ``I'm like
every other woman. I do the best I can.''
   Stephen E. Watson, chairman of Dayton Hudson Department Store
Co., summed up Lauderback's reputation in two words: ``High
energy.''
   Raised in the Pittsburgh suburb of Penn Hills by a mother who
worked as a beautician and a father who drove a truck, Lauderback
said she was warned not to give up on her goals in the face of
racism or other adversity. Her father's tombstone reads: ``I may
give out, but I'll never give up.''
   ``I've had to succeed in a white world,'' Lauderback said. ``But
there has never been a doubt to anyone of who I am.''
   Despite lofty job offers from the outside, Lauderback said she
is content for now to stay with the 37-store Dayton Hudson chain.
   Harking back to her promotion at the start of the '80s, she said
she has the best of several worlds: A job, paycheck and family she
loves.
   ``I felt like I was on a cloud then and I have stayed on that
cloud for quite a while.''

   Larry Kilcoin, a victim of the farm
depression of the 1980s, says losing his farm and seeing someone
else work the land was ``like watching someone else live with your
wife.''
   It was Oct. 19, 1987 _ a day known as ``Black Monday'' on Wall
Street half a continent away _ that Kilcoin signed the deed of his
farm over to the Federal Land Bank. Some of that land had been in
his family for three generations.
   The 440-acre corn, cattle and hog operation in the rolling hills
of west central Iowa, not far from the spot where Jesse James is
reputed to have staged the first train robbery in the West, became
another statistic in a faltering agricultural economy.
   ``The land is kind of attached to you. It's kind of like losing
your arm,'' said Kilcoin.
   His wife, Jackie, interrupted, saying, ``No, it's more like
losing your heart.''
   Kilcoin and his wife say that after 20 straight years of making
payments, they failed to meet a $35,000 annual mortgage installment
in 1985 because new management at a local bank refused to continue
a long-standing operating loan arrangement.
   ``We thought we had the operating money for the year put
together. A couple of weeks before we needed it, we found we didn't
have it,' he said.
   Kilcoin says it was a shift in inflation policy and resulting
high interest rates that did him in.
   In the 1970s, ``It was a common belief that inflation always
would be with us,'' said Neil Harl, an Iowa State University
professor and expert on agricultural economics.
   Inflationary expectations drove farmland values sky high, which
boosted the borrowing power of farmers, who used that asset as
collateral for loans.
   But the Federal Reserve's move to fight inflation with tighter
credit in 1979 drove interest rates to record heights and sent land
values tumbling. At the same time, a rising dollar made U.S. grain
and meat more expensive in foreign markets, cutting into farmers'
traditional export earnings.
   Drought hit in 1983, and Kilcoin says he never did catch up.
   Net cash farm income in Iowa, the difference between cash
earnings and cash expenses and a gauge of the money available to
repay debts or invest in operations or savings, sank from about
$2.7 billion in 1981 to around $1.6 billion in 1984.
   Farmland values in Iowa plummeted 71 percent from 1980 to 1987
after adjusting for inflation, according to the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago, a plunge even steeper than the 61 percent
inflation-adjusted slump of 1916-1942. The slide eroded the
security backing up loans held by the Kilcoins and others.
   ``We had a profit but interest rates ate up all profits and we
had to borrow money just to pay the interest rates,'' Kilcoin said
in a discussion at the table in a kitchen that has a 20-year-old
stove, a used refrigerator and a dishwasher bought for $6 in a
garage sale in the 1970s. ``It wasn't that we weren't making money;
we weren't making enough money.''
   Now 51, Kilcoin has learned a new trade, making engine bearings.
He has become a commuter who has time for his children only on
weekends and goes to community college one day a week.
   ``I still walk though the door (at work) and the door shuts
behind me and I think, `Is this really me?'''
   He's far from alone in his plight, despite the rebound in the
agricultural economy as the decade ended, with Iowa net cash farm
income shooting up to nearly $3.9 billion in 1987 and then settling
to $3.4 billion last year.
   ``The people I work with are the same people _ either they are
my age, farmed and lost or young people who wished they could farm
but can't,'' Kilcoin said.
   His wife, 49, works at home assembling small parts for car and
truck chassis for the Illinois Tool Works, earning about $200 a
week _ enough to meet payments on a used minivan and buy the
groceries.
   But before those jobs materialized, it was touch and go for the
family with three married daughters and a 13-year-old girl and
6-year-old boy at home.
   For two years the couple did not know if they would keep their
home, and Larry says he told his wife he was ready to leave the
United States if he lost the house.
   But the Kilcoins negotiated to buy back the home and 13{ acres
that surround it.
   They refused to declare bankruptcy and Jackie Kilcoin says, ``we
will be paying the rest of our lives on our debt.''
   Butnow, things are more settled.
   ``I don't have to worry about the phone ringing any more. I
don't have to be afraid of going to the mailbox,'' Mrs. Kilcoin
said.
   The couple still keeps a hand in farming, too. They fatten about
600 hogs for market under contract for a Chicago feedlot. They also
own 18 head of cattle.
   Kilcoin still has worries, including fears for his country,
which he sees overburdened by debt _ just as farmers were at the
start of the decade.
   ``That puts them in the position I was,'' he said. ``Who shuts
down the government?''

<HEAD>Biz Books Boomed in '80s, But Was There Wisdom in Volumes of Advice?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

   They wrote the book on business in the 1980s
_ over and over and over, until it seemed there were fewer
executives than authors telling them how to succeed.
   Choose your approach: Management by walking around. The flat
organization. Quality circles (actually a holdover from the 1970s).
Zero defects. How ``soft'' management skills create ``hard''
business results.
   ``How to Give Good Phone'' was an offering from Lisa Collier
Cool, ``Ed McMahon's Superselling'' a tome by the Carson sidekick
and Alpo pitchman.
   The scene for all this was set in 1982 by Thomas J. Peters' and
Robert H. Waterman Jr.'s ``In Search of Excellence,'' which proved
that critically well-received management books can also be
money-makers.
   Then came ``Iacocca,'' followed by a string of best-sellers in
the mid-'80s _ ``Megatrends,'' ``The One Minute Manager,'' ``What
They Don't Teach You at the Harvard Business School.''
   ``Those three books sold between 500,000 and 1.5 million copies
each, which was unheard of,'' said business book editor Harriet
Rubin.
   The floodgates opened.
   ``Publishing is definitely a follow-the-leader business, and
when something works they jump on the bandwagon,'' said Jim Miliot,
editor of the B.P. Report, a publishing newsletter in White Plains,
N.Y.
   ``Intrapreneuring.'' ``Thriving on Chaos.'' ``You Are the
Message.'' ``Corporate Cultures.'' ``Leadership Secrets of Attila
the Hun.''
   Miliot said the books fit right in during the '80s, with
``Reagan, the business-is-great attitude and free enterprise at its
best.''
   But were they worth reading?
   ``Most of these books are shallow, insipid and stupid,'' said
Peter F. Drucker, the longtime business consultant and writer
called the ``Dr. Spock for generations of American business
managers'' by Business Week.
   ``Everyone was trying to emulate Tom Peters,'' Drucker, 80, the
author of 24 books, said in a telephone interview from his home in
Claremont, Calif.
   Ms. Rubin, the book editor, agrees most of the books are ``dull
and they're badly written.''
   ``People were buying them, but they sort of used them as
intellectual wallpaper, or on the desk as a placebo,'' she said.
   But unlike Drucker, she thinks there's a market for yet more
business books in the 1990s.
   In fact, Doubleday has hired her as executive editor of a whole
new line, Doubleday-Currency books advertised as being dedicated to
business ``thinkers, not just doers,'' who ``rebel against the
status quo.''
   ``Who today can start a fire in our minds?'' Ms. Rubin writes in
publicity material for the books.
   ``The Iacoccas succeeded in the old world of hierarchy,
authority, and control, which has less relevance today.''
   According to Ms. Rubin, ``The new hot button is no longer
`entrepreneur' or `executive' but `change agent.' That
revolutionary is our ideal reader.''
   ``Business people would buy `In Search of Excellence,' `Thriving
on Chaos' and `Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun,''' Ms. Rubin
said in a telephone interview from New York.
   ``But the books they would actually read ... were in the
sciences, philosophy, pop culture,'' she said. ``They were trying
to make sense of complex lives.''
   The flagship publication of the new line is ``Leadership Is an
Art'' by Max DePree, chief executive of the Herman Miller Co.
furniture makers, out this fall and already in its fifth printing
with 65,000 copies in print.
   ``It's the opposite of `Confessions of an S.O.B.,' or
`Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun,''' said Doubleday
spokeswoman Jacqueline Deval.
   ``His leadership principles are based on a concern for the
health and welfare of the people working for you,'' Ms. Deval said.
``And not just for the sake of being kinder or gentler, but for
overall profitability as well, the bottom line.''
   Drucker, the dean of the management gurus, likes DePree's book
but hopes the business-book fad as a whole gets laid to rest.
   ``The boom is over _ I hope,'' Drucker said glumly. ``But I've
been saying that for two years now and I've been wrong so far.''

<HEAD>In the '80s, Reaching for the Brass Ring Required a MBA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To those who received MBAs in 1981, Wall Street
beckoned like a siren's song.
   Although a recession gripped the nation, the securities industry
and investment banks were on their way to reshaping American
businesses _ and they were hiring legions of fresh MBAs to do the
job.
   Takeovers, restructurings and stock and bond offerings became
fortune-making vehicles for an army of young people. Tales of
23-year-olds with $300,000 salaries plus bonuses abounded and lured
flocks of people to the nation's business schools.
   But what a difference a decade makes.
   These days, New York's financial district is quiet and
depressed. Tens of thousands of people were let go following the
Oct. 19, 1987, market collapse. The stock market's unsettling
volatility this fall has hurt new hiring plans.
   ``No new people are coming into the securities industry,'' said
Susan Perkins, an '81 New York University MBA grad and vice
president at the investment research boutique of Gerard Klauer
Mattison &amp; Co.
   Lucrative fees from megadeals withered this year as the dollar
volume of takeovers slumped 28 percent from 1988's heady pace,
according to Securities Data Corp. Investment houses have scaled
back commissions and shut entire departments to save money. Some
estimate bonuses will be trimmed by as much as 30 percent this year.
   The big salaries that deal people commanded during '80s ``were
clearly out of line _ and they still are,'' said Randall Rochman, a
vice president at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in Chicago and 1981 MBA
graduate of Northwestern University's Kellogg School.
   Starting salaries for MBAs doubled over the course of the
decade. NYU's Stern School said the average salary for grads
entering all facets of business was $26,936 in 1981; the average
broke the $50,000 mark this year.
   (The cost of getting the degree has nearly tripled at some
schools. Harvard University is charging $30,700 for the two-year
MBA course that cost $9,600 in 1981.)
   A recent NYU survey shows male 1979 MBA grads are averaging
$122,600 a year while their female classmates are making $87,200 on
average. And the respondents _ 143 of out of 665 alumni polled _
have averaged three promotions since leaving NYU.
   But for those hitting the pavement in 1991, the degree that once
opened doors could become an impediment at some job interviews.
Some speculate that with scrutiny of the bottom line, employers may
not readily embrace the high-priced grad clutching a master's of
business administration degree.
   ``People think the MBA is a ticket to a higher life,'' said
Scott Corwin, 31, chief operating officer at the Princeton, N.J.,
consulting firm Caliper Management Inc.
   ``Sure, they are averaging higher salaries, but in the end it
comes down to what an individual makes of an opportunity,'' said
Corwin, an '81 NYU grad.
   As Wall Street loses its allure, more grads are seeking to work
for America's corporations, and companies are carving out a greater
presence on campuses recruiting students.
   Kim Avison, 24, expects to put in 60-hour weeks in sales or
marketing for a major consumer products corporation when she
graduates in 1991 from Dartmouth University's Amos Tuck School of
Business.
   At Columbia University, MBA candidate Tim Newman, 25, said he
wouldn't be surprised if the nation slips into a recession shortly
after he graduates, but he says those who develop highly specific
skills will fare well.
   Newman hopes to become involved in investment management for a
university or charity endowment when he graduates in 1991, a far
cry from investment banking.
   If the business climate sours in the coming decade, as many
believe it will, the class of '91 ``may not have been taught, as we
weren't, how to deal with it,'' Caliper's Corwin said.
   He credits the hard economic times of the early '80s for
teaching him more about running a business than business school
ever did. ``It's much easier to manage when there's growth,'' said
Corwin, who noted that his consulting firm lost a third of its
business between 1981 and 1982.
   Current students say money is not their primary concern. ``If
you work hard, the money will come,'' Avison said.
   But one recent Ivy League grad countered that ``making money is
an essential consideration, particularly for those attending
expensive private schools.''
   Still, financial rewards come at a high price. Long hours,
broken marriages and a distorted sense of values typified business
of the '80s.
   ``I have seen what is probably a higher incidence of divorce in
our industry, I suspect because people are trying to reach for the
brass ring,'' Rochman said.
   ``The spirit of Reagan's presidency was one of hands-off,
unfettered pursuit of wealth, even greed,'' said Richard Fisher,
37, a vice president at CS First Boston, though he believes the
nation is begining to focus on more social concerns.
   If there is one axiom that holds true, it is, in Perkins' words,
that ``the business world was tough, and it still is.''

<HEAD>Crushing of Air Controllers Strike Set 1980s Anti-Union Agenda</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When Eastern Airlines pilots and flight attendants gave up a
9-month-old strike in November without much hope of reclaiming
their jobs, the surrender came as no surprise.
   President Reagan's unprecedented firing of 11,400 striking air
traffic controllers in 1981 touched off a decade of retreat for
American labor.
   Many historians say the 1980s will go down as a pivotal era when
once-powerful unions faced assault from a mix of political
conservatism, deregulation, America's declining economic might and
a barrage of corporate takeovers that resulted in unfamiliar owners
and sudden layoffs.
   While more than 12 million people joined the work force in this
country, union membership shrank by 3 million and organizers groped
for strategies to survive.
   Corporate clout strengthened as quickly as union power faded.
Bosses formerly cowed by the muscle of big labor reclaimed the
advantage in contract talks, threatening to close plants and cut
jobs unless they got concessions.
   Union-busting, once the work of hired thugs wielding baseball
bats and shotguns, was revived in the form of court orders, clever
publicity and right-to-work legislation, labor activists say.
   ``You don't look under `union busters' in the phone book,'' said
Lorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO in Washington. ``You
look under `security,' `attorneys,' and `public relations firms.'''
   The decade will be remembered by activists as the time when
airline boss Frank Lorenzo broke unions by enforcing his way in
bankruptcy court, and federal prosecutors hobbled the mighty
Teamsters union with racketeering charges in criminal court.
   It will be remembered by the United Auto Workers as the time
when Tennessee recruits of a Japanese carmaker told one of the
nation's biggest unions to go away.
   By the end of the decade, instead of fighting for higher wages,
unions were struggling to retain past victories in such areas as
health insurance, job security and pensions.
   Labor also faced assault from another direction, the lure of
employees becoming bosses themselves. Employee stock ownership
plans multiplied, affecting companies that ranged from lumber mills
to car rentals.
   The rise of ESOPs, as they are called, was part of a larger
trend of takeovers and restructurings that sought to maxmize
returns to shareholders _ often at the expense of jobholders.
   ``Clearly the employers have had the initiative in the last 10
years,'' said Kim Moody, executive director of the Labor Education
and Research Project in Detroit. ``This has forced the unions into
a more defensive posture.''
   The catalyst for the retreat was the ill-fated strike by the
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Association, which presented
Ronald Reagan with the biggest domestic challenge in the first year
of his presidency.
   He ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to dismiss and
replace the strikers, stunning the union and temporarily wreaking
havoc on the nation's network of commercial air traffic. A few
months later, PATCO dissolved, most of its members jobless and
bitter.
   ``Obviously when you have a president who goes in and busts a
union, it sends a strong signal to other industries,'' said Ms.
McHugh. ``If the president can do it, you can, too.''
   Richard Belous, a labor economist with the National Planning
Association, a Washington-based research group, said the PATCO
strike marked the end of three decades of union advances.
   ``It had tremendous symbolism,'' he said. ``The strike gave
management the intestinal fortitude to do things it wouldn't have
done before.''
   Others said the economy's weakness in the beginning of the
decade played an important role in eroding union influence, by
undermining the premise that a union shop means secure jobs.
   Deregulation was another major factor, said Alvin Bauman, a
division chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington.
   ``Where you once had a monopoly dominated by unionized firms,
deregulation made it possible for non-union firms to come in and
compete.''
   Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show about 20.1 million
working Americans belonged to unions in 1980, about 23 percent of
the total work force. By last year the number of union members had
shrunk to 17 million or 16.8 percent of the total.
   Union leaders contend they are not passive observers in the
unraveling of their power.
   While attention focused on the UAW's embarassing failure at the
Nissan Motors plant in Smyrna, Tenn., earlier this year, the Bakery
Workers union organized a Russell Stover candy plant down the road.
   The UAW itself has organized other professional workers this
decade in an effort to diversify. UAW members now range from office
clerks to jai-alai players.
   Although business groups contend labor's use of the strike is
declining because it is ineffective, unions say the strike remains
one of their potent weapons.
   The Machinists union strike against the prosperous Boeing Co.,
for example, was approved overwhelmingly in September and produced
a victory for the workers in less than two months.
   A protracted strike this fall by the Communications Workers of
America and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers against
Nynex Corp., one of the Baby Bell telephone companies, forced it to
capitulate on a key demand of the strikers, employer-paid health
insurance.
   Organized labor helped defeat the appointment of Reagan's
Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, partly because of his perceived
anti-union views.
   Perhaps their most important victory of the decade, labor
leaders say, was congressional passage of a plant closing law in
1988, which gives workers at least 60 days' notice of layoffs.
   The law was designed to stem the growing number of companies
that have shut factories without warning and moved manufacturing to
cheaper locations _ Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.
   But some say the law is a hollow victory that could discourage
potential employers from establishing new businesses in the United
States. Some even see the law as a symbol of labor's weakness.
   ``I think it's going to be a very hard time for labor in the
1990s,'' Belous said. ``Labor has been pushed back from the 40-yard
line to the 10-yard line.''

   It was almost unimaginable. The West's
most prominent banker jetting to Moscow to advise the archenemy of
capitalism.
   But Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently made such a
trip, a sign of the extraordinary changes that marked the '80s
overseas.
   It was a decade marked by the pursuit of a formula for economic
success, a drive that brought about wrenching changes. The big
winners were the most modern, complex and open economies. Far down
on the list were those dependent on natural resources and those
with closed, controlled systems.
   In Eastern Europe, some countries took their first, halting
steps toward Western-style economies and integration into the world
economy.
   In Western Europe, the European Community finally took seriously
its decision to fashion a single market of the dozen nations by
1992.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries went on a
roller-coaster ride that carried oil prices to wild levels before
crashing and finally recovering.
   Africa was caught up in the foreign debt crisis that swept the
world's developing nations in the early 1980s, sapping their
economic strength and impoverishing their growing populations even
more.
   In Europe, the events that captured the imagination, that seemed
least likely at the start of the decade, stemmed from the Soviets'
tacit acknowledgement that their economic system had failed.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who came to power in March
1985, pressed his perestroika program to restructure the backward
economy, trying to wrench it from centrally planned ways to a more
market-oriented system.
   There was talk of price reform and private enterprise, more
consumer goods and fewer government subsidies.
   ``There can be no return to the old style of economic
management,'' asserted Vladimir Shemiatenkov, Moscow's envoy to the
European Community.
   But Gorbachev's task remains staggering. Inflation is high and
so is the government's budget deficit. Millions have been thrown
out of work by the modernization efforts. Workers strike and
consumers grumble.
   ``They don't have a decent economic reform program yet,'' said
Jan Vanous of PlanEcon, a Washington forecasting firm.
   Despite the daunting challenge, reform fever is spreading in
Eastern Europe, particularly Hungary, long a leader of economic
reform in the communist bloc, and Poland, where the new Solidarity
leadership plans to move swiftly to a market economy.
   East Germany, once one of the most conservative members of the
Soviet bloc, joined the rush. West Germany offered massive
financial aid in return for stepped-up economic and political
reforms.
   The European Community quickly negotiated broad trade and
economic cooperation agreements with Poland and Hungary and a
smaller pact with Czechoslovakia. Deals also were pursued with the
Kremlin and East Germany.
   Among the Western powers, a wealth of proposals were offered for
reaching their goal of a European-wide market by 1992. In contrast
to the new freedoms symbolized by the crumbling Berlin wall, the
1992 preparations were characterized by heated disagreements over
ways to dismantle the barriers separating the Common Market allies.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher clashed with others in
their vision of Europe's future. She fought proposals to create a
common currency and central bank system, fearing a loss of
sovereignty.
   ``Britain's destiny lies in Europe,'' argued Nigel Lawson, whose
October resignation as Britain's top treasury official rocked the
government. He urged Mrs. Thatcher to relent and link the pound to
Europe's other major currencies.
   The linkage system, the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System, has brought the economies more in line, analysts
say.
   With the opening of borders between the Germanys, concern was
raised that the Bonn government would forsake the West for the
East. Government officials hastily insisted they were with the
European Community.
   The United States aggressively monitored the community's 1992
campaign, complaining of any moves to keep its products out of the
new marketplace. The term ``Fortress Europe'' was coined. Europeans
denied protectionism was afoot.
   For OPEC, the decade was trying.
   The 1979 revolution in Iran, a major oil-producing nation, was
marked by a sharp drop in crude production. World oil prices soared
above $40 a barrel, shocking the economies of the United States and
other industrialized nations.
   In late 1985, the cartel shifted strategy to defend its ``fair
share'' of the world oil market. A production free-for-all sent
prices crashing. Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark American crude, plunged to near $10 a barrel in March
1986.
   Toward the decade's end, OPEC pulled itself together. Key
members Iran and Iraq, at war most of the decade, resolved some
differences, and the cartel as a whole became less confrontational
with consuming nations. Demand for the cartel's oil grew, and
prices rebounded to around $20 per barrel.
   In Africa, the '80s were years of unrelieved misery.
   ``Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole has now witnessed almost a
decade of falling per-capita incomes, increasing hunger and
accelerating ecological degradation,'' according to a World Bank
report.
   Problems afflicting the region of 450 million people include low
foreign investment, weak export sales, growing populations,
increasing debt and poor agricultural and industrial performance.

<HEAD>Japan Excels Economically; ``Four Tigers'' in Pursuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a decade of Asian economic success, Japan piled
up No. 1 labels, four other countries gained the nickname
``tigers,'' and the star performers amassed more money to fuel
their advance into the 1990s.
   The standouts lack abundant natural resources, but have
governments that encourage private business. They share a Confucian
ethic stressing education, hard work and thrift. High savings rates
have helped pay for new and better production facilities.
   Dependence on exports forced factories to hone efficiencies
needed to compete in the international marketplace. Government
steps to hold down inflation promoted confidence and stability.
   Success in the frontrunners _ including ``tigers'' South Korea,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore _ helped pull up some of the
followers, like Thailand and Malaysia, both by example and by
expanding trade and investment.
   Asia's giant, China, also tried stressing a diligence-thrift
ethic to make its 1 billion people more productive and less poor,
but lacked the incentives of its neighbors' free-market economies
and their managerial skills and education levels. Amid scarcities,
spending on construction and efforts to live better ended up
overheating the economy.
   War impoverished Vietnam and Cambodia, although Vietnam ended
the decade by withdrawing what it said were its last troops in
Cambodia and trying to free its economy from some of the strictures
of central planning.
   The Philippines, amid a intensifying political crisis, struggled
with a legacy of foreign debt from the rule of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos, whose businessmen associates came to rely more on
favors than initiative.
   Japan struggled with problems of the rich as its high exports
and high-profile acquisitions abroad aroused resentment. It became
the world's largest creditor in 1985 and the rise of the yen
inflated its international financial power.
   In 1987, the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun calculated
that Japan had become the world's richest nation on paper, with
$43.7 trillion in total assets such as land, factories and stock,
compared with U.S. assets of $36.2 trillion.
   The inflated wealth, plus Japan's high savings rate and its
industries' new ability to finance their own investments, gave
Japanese banks the funds to become major players in world finance.
Japanese purchases of corporations and property in the United
States became a sensitive issue, although Americans continued
seeking Japanese investment.
   The abundance of funds in Japan's stock markets also has given
its corporations access to low-cost financing that U.S. companies
cannot match.
   American corporations with access to such funds likely would be
tempted to try to buy out a competitor, said Eric Rasmussen, an
economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo, while Japanese
firms tend to focus on productive capacity.
   ``Come 1991 or 1992, life could get very exciting for U.S.
companies. They are going to emerge from a period of sluggish
growth and long recuperation ... confronted with a flood of
high-quality Japanese exports,'' he said.
   This will be a result of Japanese companies' strong balance
sheets rather than an overall national strategy, he said.
   In Taiwan, too, ``companies used to rely on banks as their main
source of funds. Now they can raise more money from the stock
market and don't have to worry about banks withdrawing loans in
case of an economic slowdown,'' said Yeh Chih-yung, vice president
of Capital Securities Co.
   Officials said many of the 170 listed companies have used such
funds to automate equipment and make more sophisticated products to
overcome the impact of the rising Taiwan dollar.
   In Japan, the yen's rise since 1985 forced a major change in
mid-decade, from reliance on exports to depending on the home
market to fuel economic growth.
   But despite their country's image, most Japanese don't feel
rich, says Isamu Miyazaki, chairman of the Daiwa Institute of
Research.
   He cited workdays exceeding those in the West by perhaps 600
hours a year; cramped housing and long commutes through congested
traffic; and prices that, while stable, exceed other industrialized
nations' by 20 percent to 30 percent. These result from government
protection of agriculture and an inefficient distribution system,
he said.
   In South Korea, Kim Yong, director of the Economic Planning
Board, said curbs on government budgets and wage raises kept annual
inflation between 2.3 percent and 7.1 percent, down from more than
15 percent in the previous decade. The government also encouraged
competition to sharpen efficiency, and stressed technical
renovation. Labor unrest has erupted in Korea over the last year,
however.
   In China, rural production improved as the government ended
factory-style commune farming and gave families a chance to do some
of their own marketing and use spare time for sideline business.
   But in the state-run factories, efforts to boost productivity
faced the ``iron rice bowl,'' a system of lifetime employment in
which workers are paid the same regardless of labor performed.
   After cracking down on the democracy movement in June, the
Communist Party promoted leaders favoring order and central
planning over giving wider play to market forces.
   The next two largest Asian nations _ India and Indonesia _ also
lag in education, with Indonesia's literacy rate at 26 percent and
India's at 36 percent.
   The World Bank has given Indonesia high marks in recent years
for boosting growth by encouraging the private sector with improved
incentives and deregulation, and moving to shift the economy away
from heavy reliance on oil exports.
   India's government has favored state planning in efforts to
reduce income inequalities and promote rapid industrialization, but
analysts say this inward-looking policy has hurt efficiency and
growth.
   Australia, which looks toward Asia in its economic activity,
shares its more successful neighbors' free-market economy and high
education level, but its economic performance depends more than
theirs on prices for commodities. Its major exports include coal
and farm products.

<HEAD>A `Lost Decade' for Latin America; Foreign Debt a Millstone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1980s brought an explosion of
prosperity to developed countries but was a ``lost decade'' for
many Latin American nations that experienced more wretchedness than
glorious excess.
   Living standards fell sharply as an estimated $204 billion
flowed out of the region, most to service a collective foreign debt
of $430 billion.
   ``The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name
written with capital letters _ FOREIGN DEBT,'' Venezuela President
Carlos Andres Perez said in March after anti-government riots in
which 300 were killed and 2,000 injured.
   ``Budget adjustments, austerity programs and economic stagnation
have made the 1980s the lost decade,'' Miguel de la Madrid, then
Mexico's president, said at a Latin summit last year.
   During the 1970s, borrowing spurred economic development
throughout the region, most notably in Brazil's so-called miracle
of double-digit annual growth and low inflation.
   Railroads, steel mills, copper mines, hydroelectric dams,
nuclear power plants, airports, highways, ports and subways were
constructed from Mexico's U.S. frontier thousands of miles south to
Argentina, the last stop before Antarctica.
   Development seemed to accompany democracy, as civilians replaced
soldiers in Honduras in 1981, Bolivia in 1982, Argentina in 1983,
Brazil and Uruguay in 1985.
   Borrowing grew on a large scale, despite a steady rise in
interest rates and shrinkage of trade surpluses. It continued
almost to the moment Mexico and Brazil _ the biggest Third World
debtors _ were forced to suspend repayments.
   That development in mid-1982 set off shock waves in corporate
boardrooms and government corridors, and prompted projections of a
rupture in the world banking system.
   While that did not happen, the rest of the decade was filled
with bitter sparring between bankers and bureaucrats, the former
trying to dam the flow of red ink and the latter juggling credit
needs against a rising tide of malnutrition, illiteracy and
homelessness.
   The average per-capita income of an Argentine was $1,990 in
1980, and $360 less in 1988, World Bank figures show. Mexico's
gross national product shrank for seven straight years. Real wages
in Venezuela have slipped by one-third since 1981, and now are
estimated at the 1964 level.
   Chile, which under the rightist regime of President Gen. Augusto
Pinochet pursued policies of export expansion and a balanced budget
ahead of most neighbors, was not as badly hurt.
   Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay, and until this year
Venezuela, which has huge oil deposits, usually fulfilled their
debt obligations on time, albeit with difficulty as world commodity
prices plunged.
   Peru is a special case. President Alan Garcia capped debt
repayment at 10 percent of export earnings, a move that shut the
country out of international credit markets. Explosive growth was
followed by hyperinflation and recession.
   In most Latin countries, debt repayments during the 1980s took
up ever larger shares of national budgets, leaving less money for
public housing, schools, hospitals. Argentina alloted 20 percent of
its budget to education in 1972 and only 6 percent in 1986.
   Roads deteriorated. Completion of Yacyreta Dam in Argentina, one
of the largest construction projects in the world, was postponed.
Work on Xingo Dam, the biggest public project under way in Brazil,
was halted in October.
   Investment dried up. Today's factories are obsolete. A drought
that shifted electricity production to coal- and oil-fired
generators resulted in brownouts in Argentina and Uruguay earlier
this year. Nine of every 10 cars in Mexico are at least 5 years old.
   By printing money in part to pay the debt, Latin nations brought
on devaluations, ruinous inflation and recession. Three months
after the rioting in Venezuela this year, hungry Argentines sacked
food stores in cities surrounded by wheat fields, dairy farms and
some of the world's most fertile cropland.
   Brazilian presidential candidate Luis Inacio da Silva reflected
the emotions _ and rhetoric _ the debt issue can generate when he
said during his campaign leading up to national elections on Nov.
15:
   ``The Third World War has already started. ... It is a war by
the United States against the Latin American continent and the
Third World. It is war over the foreign debt, one which has as its
main weapon interest (payments), a weapon more deadly than the
atomic bomb.''
   As the decade ends, a resolution seems closer than at any time
since 1982.
   Latin leaders talk less of moratoriums and acknowledge that many
of their economic problems are the result not of the debt but of
government fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies.
   Much of the debt was spent to balance budgets, subsidize food
prices, maintain unrealistic exchange rates and buy military
weapons, they acknowledge, rather than to create an infrastructure
that would repay it.
   Billions of dollars were squandered in bribes, kickbacks,
illegal commissions and graft. Perhaps too much money was borrowed.
   Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's main debt negotiator, said, ``It's
indispensable not to forget the lessons of our own history and
recent past. We cannot repeat the error of taking on excessive
debt.''
   Brazil's total current debt is $110 billion. Mexico owes $107.4
billion; Argentina, $65 billion; Venezuela, $35 billion. They are
the four biggest debtors in the developing world.
   Bankers now seem to agree that economic growth must precede
repayment, and that much of the debt is unpayable, as Latin leaders
have argued for years.
   Lending institutions are accepting proposals they once resisted:
lower interest rates, deferred principal payments, debt-equity
swaps, outright forgiveness. Meanwhile, governments of many
countries are selling off state-owned enterprises and giving
capitalism a chance.
   John Reed, chairman of Citibank, said he is optimistic that
early in the 1990s the debt ``crisis'' will abate. Latin countries
will have easier access to international credit, he predicted, and
banks will be paid what they are owed.
   Reed cited Mexico's recent agreement with creditors to exchange
debt for 30-year bonds, and Venezuela's offer to set aside oil
revenues as collateral to banks willing to write down their loans.
   Late in 1989, even defiant Peru said it would resume payments on
overdue loans to the International Monetary Fund.
   When the Mexican debt relief plan was announced last July,
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari voiced the hope of all who had
struggled with the problem:
   ``The result does not mean that by magic our problems have
ceased to exist. ... we will have to keep working, but each day
will be a little better.''

   The global economic leadership of the United
States was challenged in 1980s. For two views of the future, The

   There are many reasons to question whether America's economic
and political dominance in world affairs will continue.
   A major concern centers around the erosion that has occurred in
American manufacturing. If we look at individual segments, some are
now controlled completely by foreign competitors, and others are
losing their dominance.
   Weakness in our industrial base hurts our national ability to
compete. As more and more industries decline, the manufacturers
that rely upon them lose a competitive advantage.
   Japanese automakers, for example, enjoy the advantage of a
leading edge not only in such industries as consumer electronics
and semiconductors, but also in machine tools, optics and many
more. These industries constantly furnish the Japanese auto
industry with new ideas and products. In America, we are slowly
losing the advantages of similar partnerships as more and more
sectors of our industrial base weaken.
   Does America have time to catch up? Yes, we do; but our work
extends far beyond individual industries to larger problems in our
society.
   In education, statistics indicate we are losing ground. Students
14 years old and older are dropping out of school at a rate of
700,000 annually. Thirteen percent of all 17-year-olds who are
still in school are ``functionally illiterate.''
   In capital investment, we are far behind the other major
industrial economies in the percentage of gross national product we
invest in modernizing our factories and offices. In October, The
Wall Street Journal described the capital spending boom that is
under way in Japan. Overall, Japanese capital spending this year
will be more than $520 billion, 5 percent more than American
companies will spend. Yet, Japan's total output is less than
two-thirds of ours.
   Not all of this spending will go to build new capacity. The
Journal reported that 14 percent will be spent on new or improved
products; 17 percent will be used to cut costs; and 12 percent will
be for research and development.
   Clearly, we have our work cut out for us if we hope to compete
in an environment such as this. In today's global market, no nation
has a long-term advantage in technology, managerial wisdom or
creativity. Expertise _ ``intellectual capital'' _ abounds all over
the globe.
   America can compete in this environment _ if we choose to. But
to succeed, we must pay strict attention to certain time-proven
fundamentals. Four are particularly critical: product quality,
keeping the customer in sharp focus, cost control that does not
sacrifice investment, and most important, rediscovering the value
of the employees who do the work and generate the ideas.
   Can American leadership in world affairs continue? Certainly,
but we must make significant long-term progress in two key areas.
   Education is the first. The national crisis in primary and
secondary education must be resolved. But we cannot stop here. More
of our brightest students must seek careers in science, mathematics
and engineering.
   Second, we must strengthen our industrial base by manufacturing
more of our vital components. It is always easy to buy things from
someone else. But rebuilding our industrial base will require
investment in the necessary plants and technology. This is hard
work, and the payback often can be far down the road. Yet, we have
no choice if we want to succeed.
   America is in a race that we cannot refuse to run. If we are to
cross the finish line, it will take much time and a great deal of
hard work. Today's problems were a long time in the making, and
they will not be solved with short-term actions.
   Yet, with resolve and commitment, the United States can continue
to prosper and lead.

   It has been said for a long time that the world is shifting from
a bipolar structure, with the United States and the Soviet Union
having overwhelming influence, to a multipolar one.
   The situation is changing quickly now. Symbolized by the opening
of the Berlin Wall, there is rapid reconciliation between East and
West. There are calls to build a new political and economic order
for the world in the 21st century, and expectations are mounting
for the United States to exercise its leadership.
   Former President Reagan began the rebuilding of a strong United
States ready and able to act as a true world leader. President Bush
has taken over where Reagan left off and moved forward. This is
especially so in the area of economic revitalization, and the
future outlook appears to be bright.
   Without doubt, the United States began to face up to its
problems with the ``twin deficits'' in the area of the macroeconomy
in the 1980s.
   However, I would like to make note of the voices gradually
growing in U.S. industry to make efforts to improve productivity
and quality and to become more export-oriented.
   I see it as evidence of a significant turning point for the
overall economy in the United States. Especially notable was the
report last June by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
entitled ``Made in America.'' It was a proposal to bolster U.S.
manufacturing industry, and it clearly pointed out problems in
industry and indicated directions for improvement.
   The report:
   _Criticized the pursuit of short-term profit.
   _Said there was overconfidence in U.S. technology and delay in
adapting to technological innovation.
   _Found a lack of efforts to improve quality.
   _Found disharmony in actions of the government and private
sector.
   _Recommended increased investment, better education of the work
force, a more harmonized and cooperative relationship between
organizations and their employees, and more international thinking.
   It is certainly true that U.S. leadership of the world's
politics and economies since World War II has been sustained by its
industrial competitiveness, based on its eminent productivity and
technological strength.
   Now, since the United States has begun to reconstruct its
manufacturing industry, I believe the revitalization of the U.S.
economy is real, and the United States will continue to hold the
reins of power, leading the world politically and economically in
the future.
   Many Japanese corporations, determined to satisfy changing
customer wants and needs, have been opening up factories in the
United States to put production close to the consumer.
   We are making efforts to expand local employment, increase the
local-content ratio of our products and blend into local
communities. In other words, we have been establishing ourselves as
U.S. corporations.
   As international business activities continue to transcend
national boundaries, the need to bolster U.S. industrial
competitiveness has already become an important issue, not only for
corporations with bases and business operations in America, but
also for us, corporations based in Japan.
   We, as international business people, would like to contribute
to the further strengthening of the U.S. economy.

<HEAD>Rewards of the Money Decade Weren't Equally Shared</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a common theme throughout the '80s, at
the dinner table, in academic papers, White House discussions,
political controversies, international debates. The subject was
money, and it was on everyone's mind.
   Money was the biggest economic puzzle of the decade, for those
who made an awful lot of it, for those who fell far behind in their
material well being, and for those who simply struggled to keep
pace.
   If wealth wasn't discussed, it was poverty; if not inflation,
then the threat of it; if not immediate monthly bills, then the
prospect that Social Security and private insurance plans wouldn't
take care of one's old age.
   Uncle Sam worried about a huge and growing federal deficit and a
trade imbalance that threatened America's global economic
leadership.
   Banks worried. The nation's big commercial institutions had made
billions of dollars in loans to the Third World, and it had become
apparent those loans might never be repaid. Late in the decade, the
banks began writing them off, or setting aside reserves for that
possibility.
   Business worried. A new definition of debt took hold. It meant
that enormous amounts of money borrowed at extremely high interest
rates was now an accepted method of financing corporations. Company
after company was threatened with takeover by raiders armed with
billions of dollars in such credit.
   Investors worried about the stock market. The Dow Jones
industrial average pierced new levels, poking above the 2,700 mark
in 1987 and again in 1989, but the market suffered its worst
collapse in half a century on Black Monday.
   In spite of the huge runup, those 2,700 points didn't represent
a new high in real terms. Adjusted for inflation the Dow hit its
all-time high way back in January 1966. To match that high, the
1989 Dow would have had to reach 3,900 points.
   Buyers, sellers and owners of housing worried, too, as variable
rate mortgages rose into the double digits and then descended
toward single numbers late in the decade. Real estate taxes
generally rose as well. A big income tax cut was passed to roaring
acclaim early in the decade, but almost every dollar saved as a
result of it was nibbled away by piecemeal increases that followed.
   Ordinary Americans never were relieved of money worries. While
all those big billions were talked about, average hourly earnings
of many Americans grew little in the 1980s. Aspirations didn't _
they kept rising _ and as a result consumer debt did also.
Unsolicited bank-card credit became available in the thousands of
dollars to millions of Americans who, just a decade earlier,
wouldn't have qualified for personal loans at a fraction of the
amounts.
   The unevenness persisted throughout the decade, beginning in one
of the worst recessions of the century, accompanied by what
President Carter referred to as a malaise of the American spirit.
   A new president helped lift spirits, talking a free-enterprise
language based in faith that what the country needed was a release
of the pent-up energies of Americans _ their innovativeness, their
willingness to work hard, their desire to participate and
contribute and be proud.
   President Reagan promised to remove bureaucratic shackles that
inhibited business, to deregulate industries, to take a more
relaxed view of antitrust enforcement, to lower taxes.
   What resulted, and who should be blamed or credited, will be
debated until the end of the century.
   Business did indeed pick up, and before the decade was over,
American goods were becoming competitive at home and abroad. The
gross national product, $2.63 trillion as the decade began, reached
more than $5 trillion in 1989. Trade deficits continued, however,
and some Americans were astonished to realize that it was the money
from their purchases of foreign goods that helped finance foreign
takeovers of U.S. companies and real estate, and pay for foreign
purchases of U.S. securities.
   Big as they were, the gains in gross national product worried
many people because the numbers were swollen by inflation. In
constant, or ``real'' dollars _ using the same 1982 buying power to
measure GNP in both 1980 and 1989 _ the figures were $3.2 trillion
for 1980 and about $4.1 trillion for 1989.
   Real corporate profits soared. New-business formations rose.
More than 20 million jobs were created. Women went to work in
growing numbers, and many of the elderly came out of retirement to
join teen-agers in part-time positions at grocery stores and retail
outlets.
   The spirit of free enterprise was contagious, but the rewards
weren't equally shared. While the new sense of freedom displayed
America's strengths, it also showed weaknesses. Economic laissez
faire made for an erratic, even chaotic economic course, one that
sometimes moved in questionable directions.
   Stock market manipulations became almost commonplace; corporate
takeover artists ``blackmailed'' companies with unfriendly
takeovers if they didn't pay their way out of it; the stock market
became more volatile, made so by trading schemes whose goals were
instant profits; debt rose precipitously; financial scandals eroded
faith in both industry and certain government officials. The
economy operated at a high level, but it wasn't well balanced. To
some, it was a high-wire act uncomfortable to watch because of the
constant fear of a slip. Many were left out; it was claimed by some
economists that the number of people below the poverty line rose.
When inflation was subtracted from hourly wages they were barely
higher as the decade ended. Thousands of farmers went broke. The
stock market was shunned by many individual investors. And a large
number of young households found buying a house an unaffordable
challenge.
   After seven years of expansion, the spread of economic benefits
was inconsistent by any measure. At one point in 1986, economic
strength was so geographically warped that the entire mid-section
of the country was strained by simultaneous weakness in farming,
heavy manufacturing, mining and oil. At the same time, the East and
West Coasts and parts of the Southeast enjoyed boom conditions,
based on strength in such sectors as recreation, finance and
computer-related industries.
   Such inconsistencies led to questions rather than conclusions.
Was something substantial created in the 1980s, or was it sleight
of hand? Did America strengthen itself, or merely create the
superficial impression by living off debt, by passing on a huge
burden for younger generations to pay?
   America improved in many ways, most people would agree, but even
those most convinced of progress wondered also if the economic
substructure had been weakened in subtle ways, particularly by
debts and deficits.
   Uncertainty was the nature of the decade, one of extreme pluses
and minuses. As the '90s approach, most people are still taking an
accounting, and probably will be for years to come.

<HEAD>Ford Gets Controlling Interest in Jaguar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has acquired a controlling
interest in Jaguar PLC as part of its $2.5-billion takeover of the
British luxury-car maker, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said Monday.
   Ford said that by the close of business Friday, it had acquired
77.4 percent of the outstanding shares of Jaguar stock, including
the 13 percent it owned prior to Nov. 2.
   On that day, Ford and Jaguar announced Ford would bid for all of
Jaguar's outstanding stock.
   Analysts have said adding the Jaguar cars to Ford's product line
would enhance Ford's image and provide a more stable financial base
for Jaguar.
   However, they wondered if the price Ford was paying was too
high, considering the likelihood that Ford would have to sink
another $1 billion to upgrade manufacturing processes.

   Stock prices sagged lower in quiet trading today
in the absence of any major economic news to stir investors.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.30 points to
2,720.14 at noon EST. An hour earlier the blue-chip indicator was
down 8.32 points after gaining 10.66 points on Friday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 6 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 794 issues down, 527 up and 511
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 66.15 million shares.
   Analysts said weakness in high-technology stocks was helping
drag the market lower after two major investment firms lowered the
ratings of Apple and Compaq computer companies.
   ``The market has been punishing these stocks,'' said Ralph
Bloch, chief market analyst for Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
   Profit-taking following Friday's rally also was helping depress
stock prices, said Brad Weeks, head of equity trading for
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Weeks said stock prices could decline further before the market
begins a year-end uptick as participants await fresh news on the
economy later this week.

<HEAD>Disposing of A Mighty Mountain of Trash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It isn't a pleasant subject to face around
Christmas but it is appropriate to the season. The subject is trash.
   Americans generate mountains of the stuff, particularly around
this time of year, but they don't like to face the consequences.
They like it to disappear from their property, and they don't like
to think about it thereafter.
   They must like to throw things away _ 3.5 pounds a day, compared
with 2.7 pounds a day per person in 1960, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency _ but they don't like to dwell on
the fact that there is no ``away.''
   Trash must go into recycling programs, waste-to-energy
facilities that burn it or into landfills. The EPA estimates 85
percent of it goes into landfills, which are filling up and closing
down all over the country.
   Over the past 10 years, according to an authority on the
subject, more than half the 18,500 landfills that existed in 1979
have closed, and the EPA now forecasts that by the 1990s only 4,000
will remain open.
   Conclusion: Much as they like to avoid it, Americans must face
the issue of trash production, trash collection and trash disposal.
   Lynn Scarlett's study might help. Already the study by Scarlett,
research director of the Reason Foundation, a conservative think
tank based in Santa Monica, Calif., has stirred interest in the
industry and among policymakers.
   The study points out four basic options available:
   1. Waste reduction policies.
   2. Recycling programs.
   3. Waste-to-enery facilites that burn trash.
   4. Identification and construction of additional landfills.
   Scarlett observes that other industrialized nations already
produce far less trash per person than the United States, ``amply
illustrating that it is possible, through altered habits, to
generate less trash.''
   The Japanese, Scarlett states, produce only 76 percent the
amount of garbage generated per person in the United States. France
produces even less, about 60 percent, and Germany only 40 percent
of American waste per person.
   Recycling efficiency also can be improved, according to the
study, which concludes that waste hauled to landfills could be
reduced 25 percent. Existing programs, however, handle less than 20
percent of waste in their communities.
   In fact, what is referred to as recycling sometimes isn't. Much
of what it earmarked for recycling merely ends up in the disposal
site after all, because in some cases the market for recycled
products is depressed.
   Why, asked a Reason Foundation spokesman, should forests be
harvested when the market for recycled newsprint might be falling
in price? His point: The recycling of some items might
simultaneously help conserve national assets.
   The study states that experience with waste-to-enery facilites
produces the most dramatic results, since incinerators are capable
of handling up to 90 percent of the waste stream, leaving only the
inert ashes for disposal.
   Scarlett recommends all four strategies, and that people be made
aware of the costs involved, which sometimes are hidden in general
real estate taxes; that customers be charged on a volume basis; and
that competition be invited from private garbage collectors and
disposal services.
   The study, available at no charge to community officials (2716
Ocean Park Blvd., Santa Monica, Calif. 90405), cites Seattle's
recycling program as a model that works, and provides specifics on
costs and savings in that city.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices closed lower in lackluster trading on
London's Stock Exchange Monday, as the market shadowed Wall
Street's narrow movements.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 12.1
points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,351.4 points.
   Volume amounted to a light 349.5 million shares, down from 480.1
million shares Friday.
   Dealers estimated that about 6 points of the 100-share index's
decline reflected the fact that several companies went
``ex-dividend'' Monday, including Allied-Lyons PLC, British Telecom
PLC, and Hanson PLC.
   That means the deadline for buying shares to qualify for the
companies' next dividend has passed.
   A stronger pound and news that British retail sales fell 0.8
percent in November from the previous month had little effect on
the market, dealers said.

   The U.S. dollar fell Monday against all major

Gold soared more than $5 an ounce.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was suffering from a period of

   Wheat futures prices rose moderately Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting hope for new sales of the
grain to the Soviet Union. Other grain and soybean futures finished
narrowly mixed.
   The wheat market was supported all day by the Agriculture
Department's announcement on Friday that it had increased by 4
million metric tons to 20 million metric tons the maximum amount of
U.S. grain the Soviet Union may purchase during the current
marketing year.
   Further support for wheat stemmed from President Bush's
statement Friday that he would push for granting
most-favored-nation trade status to the Soviet Union. The
designation would allow for freer trade between the superpowers.
   Forecasts for extremely cold weather this week in the Great
Plains prompted fears of damage to the winter wheat crop, which
already is under stress due to a lack of sufficient moisture.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 4\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.13{ a bushel; corn

   The stock market fell in listless trading today,
reflecting ongoing investor caution about the outlook for the
economy and interest rates.
   Stock prices were mixed at the opening, sagged to session lows
just after midday then floundered for much of the session. A late
rally erased some of the day's losses.
   Wall Street analysts said continued economic uncertainty sent
many investors to the sidelines to await fresh economic data due
out later this week.
   Reports on retail, housing and auto sales as well as producer
prices and industrial production are expected to provide further
evidence of a slowing economy, analysts said.
   Analysts said that investors hope more data suggesting a
slowdown in economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to take
steps to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, and thus
help improve corporate profits.
   High-technology stocks, which have taken a hit in recent days
due to an industry-wide slowdown, helped drag the market lower for
another day.

<HEAD>BellSouth Drops Merger Agreement With LIN After McCaw Deal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 11th graf pvs, LIN was... to UPDATE with closing stock

<TEXT>
   BellSouth Corp. on Monday agreed to terminate the
proposed merger of its cellular telephone interests with those of
LIN Broadcasting Corp., clearing the way for McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. to buy a controlling interest in LIN for $3.38
billion.
   LIN last week asked BellSouth to terminate its September
agreement for merging the cellular telephone operations in a
non-cash deal. LIN last week recommended its shareholders approve
McCaw's latest offer.
   BellSouth said it was not prepared to wage a bidding war.
   ``Our merger would have created the premier cellular company in
the world, but such decisions ultimately must reflect economic and
strategic realities,'' said BellSouth Enterprises President William
O. McCoy.
   New York-based LIN was expected to accept a termination
settlement that would pay BellSouth $66.5 million. LIN spokesman
Michael Plouf said an agreement then would be signed to proceed
with the McCaw deal.
   McCaw Chairman Craig O. McCaw said BellSouth's announcement
``clears the way for us to complete our acquisition.''
   Herschel Schosteck, whose Silver Spring, Md., company follows
the cellular telephone industry, said it would have been unwise for
BellSouth to compete with McCaw for LIN.
   BellSouth's generally conservative shareholders probably would
be averse to a prolonged takeover battle, Schosteck said. ``A fight
could have diluted earnings for years,'' he said.
   Furthermore, because it also provides regular land line
telephone service, BellSouth also was subject to certain regulatory
considerations that would not apply to McCaw, Schosteck said.
   ``BellSouth's fiduciary responsibilities precluded them from
following this through to the end,'' he said.
   LIN fell $2 to $122.25 a share Monday. Bellsouth rose $1 to
$54.50 a share and McCaw declined 75 cents to $38.75 a share.
   Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw, which has sought LIN for six
months, made a revised offer last week to buy a 50.1 percent
controlling interest in LIN for $154.11 a share, or a total of
$3.38 billion.
   The McCaw-LIN deal calls for McCaw to buy 21.9 million shares of
LIN. McCaw, which already owns 5.1 million LIN shares, would end up
with just over 50 percent of LIN's 53.9 million common shares.
   The $66.5 million termination fee for BellSouth was part of the
previous LIN-BellSouth agreement, in which the two firms would have
created a cellular telephone company with 55 million potential
customers and dominance in some of the nation's top markets.
   BellSouth would have gotten 50 percent of the stock of the
combined cellular company. Before the completion of the merger, LIN
would have spun off its television broadcasting subsidiaries to
stockholders and paid each shareholder a $20-per-share special
dividend.
   In its initial offer made June 6, McCaw proposed a buyout of all
of LIN's stock at $120 a share, or a total of nearly $6.5 billion.
   LIN and McCaw tried to negotiate an agreement, but after their
talks broke down LIN agreed to the BellSouth deal.
   LIN's business includes cellular telephone, broadcasting and
publishing. McCaw is the nation's largest cellular phone company.
   BellSouth's offer to terminate the previous agreement also
includes a provision for McCaw to contribute $26.5 million to Los
Angeles-based RCC's Inc., of which BellSouth owns 85 percent and
McCaw 15 percent. The California company owns an equity interest in
the Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co.
   In a related development Monday, Standard &amp; Poor's announced it
had removed BellSouth Capital Funding Corp. and BellSouth Capital
Funding-Australia Ltd., subsidiaries of the Atlanta company, from
its ``CreditWatch'' _ where they had been placed Oct. 30.
   S&amp;P reaffirmed its ``AAA'' ratings on senior unsecured debt for
the subsidiaries in response BellSouth's withdrawal from the
proposed LIN cellular merger.

   Wyse Technology Inc., the world's second
largest maker of computer terminals, agreed Monday to a $268
million buyout by a Taiwan group in a deal that could boost the
company's flagging business.
   Wyse, which is based in San Jose but does all manufacturing in
Taiwan and elsewhere overseas, began a search for buyers after
losing $21 million in the 1989 fiscal year ended March 31.
   The $10-per-share buyout by Channel International Corp., an
investment group of government and local enterprises, is the
largest ever of a foreign firm by Taiwan.
   ``A lot of U.S. companies looked at Wyse but figured it wasn't
worth more than $4 or $5 a share,'' said Michael Murphy, editor of
California Technology Stockletter. ``Wyse got the best price it
could from Taiwan.''
   ``The acquisition is an important step for Taiwan's electronics
and computer industries to enter the world market,'' Koo Cheng-fu,
chairman of China Investment and Trust Co., the largest investor in
the buyout, said in a news conference in Taiwan.
   Koo said his group would use Wyse's sales channels and
technology personnel to promote Taiwan's high-technology products.
   Wyse, an 8-year-old company that earned $28 million in fiscal
1988 before slumping, holds more than a 50 percent market share for
general-purpose terminals in the United States. Worldwide, Wyse
trails only International Business Machines Corp. as a supplier of
terminals, said Greg Blatnik, an industry analyst for Dataquest
Inc. in San Jose.
   Terminals, which can be hooked to mainframes, minicomputers or
personal computers, accounted for 47 percent of Wyse's $452 million
in sales in fiscal 1989. Personal computers accounted for 39
percent, and screen monitors accounted for 14 percent of sales.
   Wyse is expected to sell 800,000 terminals worldwide by the end
of 1989, nearly all to businesses, compared with just over 1
million by IBM, Blatnik said.
   In the first six months of fiscal 1990, ending Sept. 29, Wyse
had $231 million in revenue and net losses of $7.7 million.
   Wyse has been less successful in selling IBM-compatible personal
computers, and Blatnik said that is the area that should get the
most attention from the new Taiwanese owners.
   ``The whole concept of the deal has to be looked at as a
positive step for Wyse,'' Blatnik said. ``It gives them financial
stability, and over the long term provides them with a better focus
on the PC side of their business.''
   Although Wyse has a reputation for making low-priced,
high-quality terminals and personal computers, its strategy in the
PC market has hurt the company's growth, said Murphy.
   ``Wyse has a strategy of not producing the most advanced
computers,'' he said. ``They wait to see how the latest technology
shakes out and then try to move in with lower prices. That hasn't
worked out for them. They need to be more innovative.''
   Wyse Chairman Bernard K. Tse will remain with the company as
vice chairman.
   Morris Chang, former senior vice president Texas Instruments and
former president of General Instrument Corp., will become chairman
and chief executive officer of Wyse.
   Chang has been serving as chairman of the Industrial Technology
Research Institute, a non-profit research and development
organization established in 1973 to accelerate the development of
advanced technology in Taiwan.
   He said he doesn't plan significant near-term changes in Wyse's
product lines or its approach to business, and intends to maintain
its headquarters, marketing and related operations in San Jose.
   Taiwanese businessmen have shown growing interest in acquiring
foreign firms, which they believe could boost their business in the
world market.
   Last month, Samuel Hsieh, governor of the Central Bank, proposed
using Taiwan's foreign reserves of about $73 billion for loans to
local enterprises for overseas acquisitions.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Surge, Approach New 1989 High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices surged to within a few dollars of new 1989
highs Monday on New York's Commodity Exchange as the market
extended for a fifth day its recovery from a steep
post-Thanksgiving decline.
   On other commodity markets, orange juice futures rose sharply on
Florida freeze fears; cotton futures rebounded; energy futures
gained; pork futures fell; cattle futures rose; and grains and
soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $4.90 to $5.50 higher with the contract for
delivery in December up $5 at $416.80 a troy ounce.
   The December contract reached an intra-day high of $418 an
ounce, just $1.70 below the 1989 high of $419.70 reached on Nov. 24.
   Silver futures finished 4.5 cents to 4.9 cents higher with
December at $5.692 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said that after climbing back steadily from about $401
in the past week, gold looked strong enough to break through $420
an ounce, an event that would likely trigger new waves of buying.
   Explanations for the recovery abounded but four market analysts
queried by The Associated Press agreed the political changes
occurring in Eastern Europe were in some way linked to gold's
strength.
   ``The market reads this as one of the watershed geopolitical
events of the 20th century,'' said Richard Levine of Elders Futures
Inc.
   Levine noted a strong correlation between the gold market and
the West German mark, which he interpreted as evidence that
investors expect West Germany to benefit economically from Eastern
Europe's movement away from communism.
   James E. Sinclair, a director and chief economist of Diversified
Investors Corp., saw signs that the Soviet Union is preparing to
issue gold-backed bonds and halt all sales of gold on the open
market.
   Gold traders also responded to Monday's higher energy prices,
typically a buy-signal for inflation-sensitive gold, said Peter
Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Orange juice futures rose sharply on the New York Cotton
Exchange amid forecasts for a hard freeze in Florida by the end of
the week.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 2.45 cents to 3.75
cents higher with January at $1.313 cents a pound.
   Cotton futures also climbed sharply in a move that analysts
viewed as a technical correction after several sessions in which
prices fell.
   Cotton settled .60 cent to 1.73 cent higher with March at 67.91
cents a pound.
   Heating oil continued to lead energy prices higher on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as extremely cold temperatures in Europe
spurred demand for fuel oil on the world market.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 23 cents
higher with January at $20.70 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent
lower to .58 cent higher with January at 66.95 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .11 cent to .40 cent lower with January at
52.40 cents a gallon.
   Frozen pork bellies dropped the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit for
the third straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, partly
reflecting disappointment over the government's slow pace in buying
bellies to donate to Poland.
   Cattle futures advanced in line with strong cash markets. Hog
futures were mixed.
   Live cattle settled .45 cent to 1.17 cents higher with December
at 76.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .47
cent higher with January at 83.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .28
cent lower to .35 cent higher with December at 51.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with February at
50.45 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures prices rose moderately on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid hopes for new sales of the grain to the Soviet Union.
Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 3} cents higher with December
at $4.13{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1} cents higher with
December at $2.35 a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher
with December at $1.44\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2
cents higher with January at $5.79 a bushel.

   Wholesale home heating oil prices rose Monday as
wintry weather boosted demand. Crude oil futures also closed higher
but gasoline futures finished lower.
   The contract for No.2 heating oil for January delivery rose 0.58
cent to 66.95 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
adding to Friday's gain of 0.90 cent. Contracts for delivery during
February and March ended with much smaller increases while the
April contract fell slightly.
   Low temperatures in parts of the United States and Europe
spurred buying, analysts said.
   Buyers in the crude oil pit took a cue from heating oil traders
and bid prices higher. The January contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 22 cents
to $20.70 per 42-gallon barrel after losing 3 cents on Friday. The
February through April contracts ended with similar gains.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which sank 0.16
cent on Friday, dropped another 0.25 cent to 52.40 cents a gallon.
Other contracts closed lower also.
   Gasoline prices typically soften in the winter when driving
tapers off due to bad weather.
   Energy analyst Linda Simard at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said
buying enthusiasm in London spilled over into U.S. markets. In
Europe, prices of gasoil _ the equivalent of U.S. heating oil _
have firmed because of shortages and a seasonal pickup in demand.
   She said there were reports Monday that a drought in parts of
Europe, which has caused low water levels on the Rhine River, has
reduced production of hydroelectric power.
   The result has been extra demand for alternative energy sources.
France now is importing more energy than it is exporting while
normally the country is a net energy exporter, Simard said, citing
reports circulating in the futures markets.

   Stock prices fell in listless trading Monday
amid investor uncertainty about the economy and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 3.20 points to
2,728.24 after gaining 10.66 points in Friday's session.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by a 5 to 4 margin in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
844 issues down, 669 up and 477 unchanged. Traders said
high-technology stocks led the losers after two brokerages lowered
the investment ratings of Compaq and Apple computer companies.
   Wall Street analysts attributed the market's overall weakness to
investor uncertainty about the prospects for the economy and to
profit-taking after Friday's modest rally.
   ``The word is apprehension, particularly given the sad state of
profits and no apparent reason to believe that will change,'' said
Hugh Johnson, senior vice president of First Albany Corp.
   Johnson said based on last Friday's report on November
employment, many economists have revised downward their
fourth-quarter economic forecasts. The report showed the jobless
rate rose to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent in October. In addition,
despite a gain of 210,000 jobs in November, October's pace of jobs
growth was revised downward.
   ``The consensus before the report was for a growth rate of about
1.5 percent, now it's closer to 1 percent,'' Johnson said.
   Analysts said many investors were noncommital ahead of a slew of
new government reports due out this week which could provide a
better clue about the economy's direction, among them November
retail sales, producer prices, industrial production and capacity
utilization.
   Investors hope further evidence of an economic slowdown will
persuade the Federal Reserve to take steps to lower interest rates
and thus help boost sagging corporate profits, analysts said.
   Analysts said some investors also took the opportunity to do
year-end housecleaning in the absence of fresh economic news to
stir the market.
   ``It was a continuation of year-end tax selling, some for
profits some reflecting negativism about former favorites with the
focal point being high-tech stocks on the sell side,'' said Jack
Solomon, equities analyst for Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 147.13 million
shares, up from 144.91 million in Friday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 177.28 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $6.221 billion, or 0.18
percent, in value from Friday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.09 to 192.83.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Pinacle West, the most
active stock, fell | to 10], Compaq Computer dropped 4\ to 81|
after First Boston Corp. downgraded the stock's investment rating,
IBM lost } to 96[, and Pfizer tumbled 1{ to 67|.
   Apple Computer, the most active stock on the over-the-counter

investment rating and earnings estimate for the company.
   On the plus side, Federal National Mortgage rose } to 35],

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 0.31 to 398.91, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index edged down 0.13 to 348.56.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 3.80 to 452.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 375.04, down 0.41.

   United States and Netherlands securities
regulators have signed a pact to assist each other in conducting
investigations and enforcing their respective securities laws, the
Securities and Exchange Commission announced Monday.
   Officials hailed the administrative assistance agreement, signed
Monday at The Hague, as the most comprehensive formal securities
enforcement accord yet between the United States and a European
country.
   ``Each of our nations has a common interest in protecting
investors at home, and in foreign markets, from fraud, manipulation
and similar abusive practices,'' SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden
said in written remarks prepared for the signing at The Hague.
   ``The agreement signed today strengthens our ability and detect
these types of unlawful activities conducted across national
borders,'' Breeden stated.
   The agreement also was signed by Dutch Minister of Finance Wim
Kok.
   U.S. investors' transactions in Dutch corporate stock increased
from $1.9 billion to $4 billion between 1985 and 1988. During the
the same period, Dutch transactions in U.S. corporate stock
increased from $4 billion to $5.8 billion.
   Under the agreement, the SEC and Dutch finance ministry will
assist each other in enforcing their respective securities laws,
including obtaining information and documents, taking statements
and conducting compliance examinations or inspections of securities
businesses.
   The agreement applies only to territory of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands in Europe and not in the Caribbean.
   Mutual cooperation in criminal matters, however, will continue
to governed by a 1981 mutual assistance treaty.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group headed by Texas
billionaire Harold C. Simmons disclosed Monday that it has
increased a stake in Lockheed Corp. to 16.9 percent.
   The group stated in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it had acquired 3.83 million shares of the defense
contractor's shares since Nov. 22.
   All the shares were purchased at prices ranging between $36.75
and $39.25 per share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The group still indicated that the stock purchase for investment
purposes only.
   A spokesman for Lockheed at its Calabasas, Calif. headquarters,
Robert Slayman, said the company would have no comment on the SEC
filing. Lockheed, maker of the stealth bomber and other defense
weapons, has declined to comment on Simmons' previous stock
purchases.
   Earlier this year, Simmons revealed he had a 5.3 percent stake
in Lockheed, prompting Lockheed to create an employee stock
ownership plan (ESOP) to block any takeover attempt.
   Simmons, who has holdings in the chemical, timber and sugar
industries, at first reduced his holdings in Lockheed and has since
increased it several times to 6.25 percent, then 9.46 percent and
10.43 percent.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston announced plans Monday to sell its
$590 million credit card portfolio because of difficulties in
competing with companies that operate multibillion dollar credit
card operations.
   Bank of Boston spokesman Wayne Taylor said that since the 1970s,
the credit card business had grown to the point where just a few
companies had amassed a large chunk of the market.
   Taylor said although Bank of Boston was the 15th largest bank in
the United States, it ranked only 33rd among credit card suppliers.
   The bank has 675,000 Mastercard and VISA cardholders, located
mostly in New England, for revenues of $590 million. By comparison,
Taylor said, giant Citicorp has credit card revenues of more than
$21 billion annually.
   ``We'd have to spend a lot of money to continue to compete in
this field,'' Taylor said. ``We came to the point where we decided
to put our resources elsewhere.''
   Taylor said the bank would concentrate on expanding its branch
network throughout New England and on broadening its range of
consumer finance products, such as home equity, residential
mortgages and student loans.
   He did not identify any possible buyers for the credit card
business.

<TEXT>
   After four years of disagreements, the
International Monetary Fund announced on Monday that it has reached
an accord with Peru, raising the prospect of financial aid if
Peruvian policies meet its approval.
   An official of the fund, who spoke on condition he not be named,
said Peru had made a payment of $42.3 million on the $800 million
it owes the fund. The payment covers only the arrears since
September of this year.
   The agreement was reached last week between Peru's negotiator,
Abel Salinas, and Michal Camdessus, the fund's French managing
director, the official said.
   Owned by 152 governments, the fund negotiates at length with
governments in financial trouble. It gives its help only when the
borrowing government agrees on a set of policies it approves.
Usually these include cuts in government spending, especially on
official payrolls and subsidies, and often a devaluation of the
country's currency.
   Peru has been in trouble with the financial world since
President Alan Garcia was elected in 1985 and announced that he
would make only partial payments of interest on the country's
debts. At that time Peru owed $14 billion abroad. Now the figure is
closer to $20 billion.
   Its financial troubles have been worsened by the continuing
rebellion of a leftist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, and a
thriving traffic in drugs.
   Peru is one of 10 countries with a total arrears of $3.5 billion
to the fund, and so ineligible for more finanical aid from it _ or
much from anyone else. This year the fund started a series of what
it called ``shadow programs,'' under which governments promised new
policies but got no immediate money. Vietnam, Zambia, Somalia and
now Peru have started such programs.
   If the fund finds they are doing well after a year or so, they
will start getting its financial help.

<HEAD>Labor Department Orders Eastern Compliance on Health Benefits</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department on Monday said it has obtained
an order requiring Eastern Airlines to help striking and laid-off
employees obtain continued health benefits.
   ``Employers must know that the Labor Department is serious about
protecting the right of working Americans to continued health
coverage in cases like Eastern,'' Elizabeth Dole, Secretary of
Labor, said in a statement released in Washington concerning
Eastern and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.
   The consent order, which requires Eastern to report on its
compliance quarterly for five years, followed an investigation by
Labor officials into complaints by Eastern COBRA participants who
said insurance carriers told them they were no longer covered, even
though the employees had paid insurance premiums. The federal law
says employers must give terminated employees the chance to obtain
continued health benefits at group rates.
   ``As a result (officials) began a large-scale investigation into
possible violations of notification and insurance claims processing
provisions under COBRA,'' said David George Ball, assistant Labor
Secretary.
   Wally Haber, senior general chairman of the Machinists union
that's been on strike since March 4, said employees were
inappropriately rejected on claims or faced backlogs of up to six
months.
   ``We've been having a running battle with Eastern on the COBRA
violations,'' Haber said.
   Haber said just before the strike began, Eastern laid off most
of its workers in the insurance department, which contributed to
the backlog. Haber said employees have had better results recently.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said claims were taking an
average of four weeks to process. He said the consent order would
have no financial impact on Eastern.
   ``We're up-to-date now,'' he said.
   Matell blamed initial problems on a combination of hostile
union-management relations, the complications of the Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization Eastern filed for March 9, and the
massive number of employees suddenly on strike o laid off. Also, he
said, Eastern had computer problems that exacerbated the delays.
   ``We feel that we really reacted admirably in the unusual
circumstances,'' Matell said. ``The COBRA law never contemplated
such wide-ranging and massive problems.''
   Eastern has been operating as a much smaller airline because of
the strike and bankruptcy reorganization. It reportedly is close to
selling Latin American routes to AMR Corp., parent of American
Airlines, for $300 million to $400 million.
   Neither Fort Worth-based AMR nor Eastern would discuss the deal,
reported in several newspapers. But there was speculation a deal
could be announced by Wednesday, when Eastern is scheduled to meet
with a committee of creditors.
   The negotiations with AMR on the Latin American routes are the
second round since Eastern sought Chapter 11 protection. Earlier
attempts to sell the routes to AMR foundered over disagreements
involving a lawsuit filed against American by Continental Airlines,
the other main Texas Air subsidiary.
   During the strike American, the nation's largest airline, has
been expanding aggressively in the Caribbean _ a key area for
Eastern.

   H.J. Heinz Co. reported a 14.1 percent
increase in second-quarter earnings Monday, helped by stronger
sales and higher prices for its food products.
   Earnings for the Pittsburgh-based food manufacturer totaled $125
million in the period ending Nov. 1, or 47 cents per share, vs.
$109.9 million, or 42 cents per share a year earlier. The per-share
figures reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in September.
   Sales during the second quarter amounted to $1.5 billion, up 7.5
percent from $1.4 billion in 1988. The gain resulted from higher
volume of tuna, frozen potatoes and Weight Watchers frozen meals,
as well as price increases.
   For the first six months of 1989, net income was $251.9 million
or 95 cents a share, up 14.5 percent from last year's $219.9
million or 84 cents a share a year earlier.
   Sales for the first half of 1989 increased to $2.9 billion, up
6.4 percent from last year's $2.8 billion.

<HEAD>Royal Crown Asks FTC for Sanctions Against Pepsi, Coke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Royal Crown Cola Co. has asked the Federal Trade
Commission to invoke sanctions against bigger rivals Pepsico and
Coca-Cola Co. for what it called ``predatory pricing'' by their
company-owned bottling plants.
   Al Burke, president and chief operating officer of Royal Crown,
said Monday that the company has asked the FTC for sanctions
against the two. Royal Crown has requested that Pepsi and Coke be
prohibited from acquiring additional holdings in their franchise
systems, Burke disclosed at a beverage industry gathering in New
York.
   In addition, he said, the FTC should order the two companies to
divest their interests in company-owned bottling plants and the
brands other than Coke and Pepsi produced by those operations.
   Under the request, Royal Crown has asked the FTC to require that
the two companies each reduce their holdings in company-owned
plants to 25 percent within two years _ at which time they would be
sold.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola declined comment, saying it was unaware
of any FTC investigation of the issue, said spokesman Randy
Donaldson.
   Pepsico, based in Purchase, said it hasn't been contacted on the
matter by the federal agency or Royal Crown.
   ``There's really nothing new here and certainly nothing the
industry hasn't heard before,'' said Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman for
the company's Pepsi Cola operations.
   Royal Crown's appeal to the FTC is the second time in three
years the company has filed complaints with the agency against Coke
and Pepsi. In 1986, Royal Crown asked the FTC to block Pepsi's
proposed acquisition of Seven-Up Co. and Coke's planned buyout of
Dr Pepper, claiming the purchases would violate federal antitrust
laws.
   The FTC later blocked the acquisitions on antitrust grounds.
   Royal Crown, based in Miami, is a subsidiary of Chesapeake
Financial Corp., which is in turn controlled by industrialist
Victor Posner.
   In his talk, Burke called predatory pricing the most serious
problem facing the U.S. soft drink industry.
   Predatory pricing consists of pricing products below cost to
beat competitors, then quickly hiking them back up after the action
has succeeded.
   Burke charged, for example, that it costs bottlers about 80
cents to put a two-liter bottle in a supermarket, but Coke and
Pepsi both sold the bottles for 69 cents each last Labor Day
weekend in Dallas.
   Coke has 41.1 percent of the U.S. soft drink market, followed by
Pepsi with 31.1 percent. Royal Crown has only 2.8 percent,
according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication.

   Banks and foreign exchange houses
were closed Monday to give them time to digest the
government-ordered 34.5 percent currency devaluation, along with
the postponement of payments on the nation's massive internal debt.
   Initial reaction was mixed over the plan, which was the second
severe economic adjustment in five months. Spokesmen for organized
labor criticized it while many businessmen said the changes were
necessary to stabilize the economy.
   Both sides expected rates to be increased for electricity,
transportation and other public services, which along with the
devaluation was expected to acclerate inflation.
   Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli said Monday night in a speech
broadcast nationwide that an increase in inflation would be
``transitory,'' and that the government's program of deregulation
and privatization would continue.
   Rapanelli blamed the need for the new measures on ``speculative
maneuvers'' that put pressure on the exchange rate.
   The government news agency Telam reported late Monday that the
prices of many consumer items that had been regulated _ including
stereos, washing machines, clothing, shoes, fresh chicken, coffee _
would be freed.
   However, about a dozen basic commodities _ including cooking
oil, rice, pasta, bread and tea _ would be subject to controls that
set maximum prices.
   Shortly before midnight Sunday, the government devalued the
austral to 1,000 per U.S. dollar from the previous rate of
655-to-1, bringing the austral in line with its black market value.
   State-controlled gasoline prices were boosted by about 60
percent, bringing the price of a gallon of regular gas to the
equivalent of $1.44.
   To help Argentines cope with the measures, the government
authorized monthly pay increases for December of $30 to public
employees and $24 for private sector employees.
   Unions which already had been staging pay strikes said the
raises were not enough. Commuter train lines were halted by
stoppages Monday and court clerks pledged to renew their boycott
that disrupted the judicial system nationwide last week.
   ``This adjustment plan does not help the interests of workers,''
said Ruben Pereyra of the General Labor Confederation, the 3
million-member coalition that includes most every Argentine union.
   Livio Kuhl, a spokesmen for business leaders who met with
President Carlos Menem just before the measures were announced,
said they supported the changes along with Menem's plans to
privatize and deregulate Argentina's economy.
   The measures _ particularly the pay increases and the
devaluation _ almost certainly will stoke inflation that has grown
at triple-digit rates in 14 of the past 15 years.
   The last economic adjustment, on July 9, devalued the austral by
54 percent, hiked public service rates by 200 percent and more, and
imposed wage and price guidelines.
   That helped bring monthly inflation down to 5.6 percent in
October from 197 percent in July, but fueled labor unrest because
real wages did not keep pace with price hikes.
   The November inflation rate was 6.5 percent, higher than the
previous month for the first time since Menem took office on July
8. The December rate will be double-digit, independent analysts
projected.
   The price of a kilogram of beef, or 2.2 pounds, soared by 40
percent Monday to the equivalent of 54 cents.
   In an effort to curtail a flow of australs into the economy,
which would renew downward pressure on the exchange rate if
Argentines chose to buy dollars, the government announced Sunday it
would delay the payment of state-issued bonds by two years.
   The government's internal debt is estimated at $7 billion, or
about 10 percent of the gross national product. About $650 million
was due to be paid by March 1.
   Interest will continue to be paid, the Economy Ministry said.

<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Shopping Network Inc. on Monday
announced record sales and earnings for the quarter ended Nov. 30,
including an 85 percent increase in profit.
   The results represent a turnaround for the electronic retailer,
which sells products through a television show shown on cable TV
networks. HSN lost $26.1 million in the quarter ended Aug. 31, and
lost $14.9 million for the fiscal year that ended that date.
   For the most recent quarter, net income grew to $20.2 million,
or 21 cents per share, from the $10.9 million, or 12 cents a share,
for the same period last year, the company said.
   Sales for the quarter were a record $255.2 million. That was up
27.2 percent from the $200.6 million reported for the same period
last year, the company said.
   ``The solid gains HSN has reported in the first quarter
reinforce our decision to focus the company's resources to its core
business, electronic retailing,'' said Roy M. Speer, chairman and
chief executive officer.
   The retailing firm has streamlined its operations, Speer said,
and has ``significantly curtailed or eliminated activities that did
not provide adequate returns on our investments.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nestle Foods Corp. said Monday it has agreed to
suspend purchases of coffee from war-torn El Salvador for 30 days.
   In a letter to a peace group that is calling for a boycott of
Salvadoran coffee, Nestle said it ``disapproves of the violence in
El Salvador because it is a violation of human rights.''
   On Friday, Hill Bros. Coffee said it had suspended for 30 days
any new deals to buy coffee from the Central American country,
citing ``deep concern'' about fighting there in recent weeks.
   Nestle public relations director Barbara Campbell said in the
letter, released by the San Francisco-based peace organization
Neighbor to Neighbor, that it currently does not have any
Salvadoran coffee in its inventory.
   Nestle, which makes Nescafe and Tasters Choice instant coffees,
met with a Neighbor to Neighbor representative Friday.
   Nestle officials could not be reached for comment late Monday at
their Purchase headquarters. A Neighbor to Neighbor spokesman said
Nestle buys 3 percent to 5 percent of its coffee from El Salvador.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. last week refused to join the boycott,
which is part of an effort to pressure the Salvadoran government to
negotiate a settlement to the country's civil war.
   Coffee is a $200 million cash crop in El Salvador and accounts
for about 5 percent of the coffee consumed in the United States.
   More than 70,000 lives have been lost in violence in El Salvador
during the past decade. Six Jesuit priests were murdered there
about a month ago.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Proponent Resigns as Columbia Savings Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The troubled junk bond market
claimed the job of one of its biggest supporters Monday when Thomas
Spiegel said he would quit as chairman of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association at the end of the year.
   Under the leadership of Spiegel, a former Wall Street trader,
Columbia invested more heavily than any other thrift in high-yield,
high-risk bonds, turning big profits on them until recently.
   But new federal laws forced Columbia to essentially return to
being a conventional mortgage lender. The thrift in October marked
down the price of its junk bonds to reflect their depressed market
value, as required by new federal law, taking a loss of about $350
million. Columbia plans to sell the junk bonds to a new subsidiary.
   Previously, thrifts didn't have to adjust the book value of
their bonds to account for market price because they carried them
as long-term investments.
   Columbia's high-yield portfolio is now worth $3.8 billion, down
from $4.3 billion at the end of last year, and Spiegel said the
thrift urgently needed to rid itself of the bonds.
   Spiegel said he would work full time as a consultant to
Columbia, trying to line up investors for the subsidiary into which
the junk bonds would be spun off.
   A thrift bailout bill signed by President Bush in August
requires thrifts to sell their junk bonds by 1994. Under the
legislation, thrifts can invest in junk bonds only through
separately capitalized affiliates rather than using
government-insured deposits.
   ``Business imperatives coupled with the publicity surrounding me
led me to conclude that a new CEO with extensive banking or thrift
experience was required to lead Columbia into the future,'' Spiegel
said in a statement.
   Columbia said it already had begun interviewing potential
successors.
   Spiegel is a friend of junk bond pioneer Michael Milken, who has
been indicted on racketeering and securities fraud charges. New
charges against Milken reportedly will include allegations of
illegal stock and bond deals with Columbia.
   Spiegel was unavailable for an interview, but Columbia
spokeswoman Lenore Hatch said he intended to hold the bonds to
maturity in the new Columbia subsidiary. She said it was too early
to describe in detail how the subsidiary would work.
   ``Hopefully the structure we're considering would have the
effect of removing the volatility that's in the high-yield
market,'' she said.
   Spiegel said in his statement that the depressed market for junk
bonds had created big opportunities.
   ``During the eight years in which I have been actively involved
in the high-yield securities market, I have never seen better
values,'' he said.
   Spiegel, 43, noted that his family owns more than half of
Columbia's common stock. ``I believe that it is urgent that I move
rapidly to preserve and enhance the value of our securities
portfolio,'' he said.
   Fueled largely by Spiegel's investments in junk bonds,
Columbia's assets jumped to $13 billion this year from $400 million
in 1974.
   But in the third quarter of this year Columbia lost $226 million
as a result of $357.5 million in losses related to those bond
holdings.
   Columbia said that because of problems with junk bond
investments it will be unable to meet the tougher requirements for
risk-based capital under the savings and loan bailout law.
   In order to boost its capital, Columbia has agreed to sell
nearly all its mortgage-backed securities for about $90 million,
and to sell ``certain public and private equities'' for a gain of
about $75 million, the thrift said in a statement.
   Columbia said it has raised $10 million more through various
asset sales and other actions.
   Thrift institutions like Columbia that do not meet the new
capital requirements are required to file a capital plan acceptable
to federal regulators by Jan. 8. Columbia said its plan will, as
required, detail its financial strategy for compliance, but the
thrift provided no details.
   Spiegel was paid $5.6 million in 1987 and $4.1 million last
year. Ms. Hatch said his pay package as a consultant has not been
determined, and she declined to estimate how much he will make this
year.
   His high salaries have angered federal thrift regulators for
years, as has his amassing of the huge portfolio of junk bonds.
   He also is known for his close ties to political figures. He set
up the junk bond investment for former House majority whip Tony
Coelho that forced the Democrat to resign last May.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Cook Travel Inc. has formed a business
partnership with Crimson Travel Service and Heritage Travel, saying
the new agency is the nation's third-largest travel company.
   Thomas Cook Travel, which was acquired in April by Britain's
Robert Maxwell, will own 50 percent of the new partnership, while
the other 50 percent will be owned by the Crimson-Heritage owners.
   The combined company will have more than 325 offices nationwide
with 2,500 employees and travel sales in excess of $1.3 billion
annually.
   David Paresky, who founded Crimson Travel Service about 25 years
ago, will head the partnership, which will be known as Thomas Cook.
   He said Crimson Travel formed a partnership with Heritage Travel
about 18 months ago and began discussing about an affiliation with
Cook a year ago.
   He said Crimson-Heritage, based in Cambridge, Mass., operates
from 175 locations in 22 states and had about $700 million in sales
last year.
   Its offices will continue to operate for the time being under
their current names but eventually will be known as Thomas Cook
operations, Paresky said.
   Thomas Cook Travel, based in New York, operates from about 150
locations and had sales of about $650 million last year, Paresky
said.
   A spokesman for Crimson said the new operation, which will be
the U.S. member of the multinational Thomas Cook Group network
based in London, will be the third-largest U.S. travel company,
following those operated by American Express Co. and Carlson Cos.'
Ask Mr. Foster.
   ``We have created a company with the leadership and resources to
provide our customers with unequaled global travel service,''
Maxwell said in a statement.

   TVX Broadcast Group Inc. said Monday
that Paramount Communications Inc. has acquired preferred and
common stock of the Virginia Beach-based independent television
station owner for $110 million.
   In addition, the New York-based entertainment and publishing
conglomerate acquired about $30 million worth of TVX debt
obligations.
   TVX said the shares acquired by Paramount consist primarily of
convertible preferred stock that when converted to common shares
would give Paramount about a 79 percent stake in TVX. The
conversion requires approval by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Paramount acquired the shares and debt from TVX's investment
banker, Salomon Brothers Inc., and the acquisition formally ended
Salomon's involvement with TVX.
   ``We exchanged a financial institution for an entertainment
company,'' said Aubrey E. Loving Jr., TVX's chairman. ``We now have
like interests as we go forward with the future.''
   Revenues have improved 11 percent for the first three quarters
of 1989 at five of TVX's eight stations _ in Philadelphia,
Washington, Dallas, Houston and Raleigh, N.C. TVX also holds
stations in San Antonio, Texas, and New Orleans. It plans to sell
the New Orleans station in early 1990.

<TEXT>
   The Holiday Corp. announced Monday its
board of directors has approved payment of a special cash dividend
of $30 per share by the Promus Companies Inc. after Promus is spun
off from Holiday. The dividend is $5 lower than originally
anticipated.
   The dividend is one of several developments announced by the
Memphis-based corporation in connection with the pending
acquisition of the Holiday Inn hotel system by Bass PLC of Great
Britain and the spinoff of a subsidiary, recently named Promus.
   Promus, which will own Holiday's gaming operations and the
Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites hotel chains, will
be managed by the current Holiday Corp. senior management.
   The payment of the dividend from Promus is subject to approval
of the transaction by stockholders at a meeting expected in January.
   The corporation also announced an agreement with Sumitomo Bank
Limited providing financing for the special dividend.
   ``Until recently, indications were that financing was available
on favorable terms to pay a $35-per-share dividend,'' said Michael
D. Rose, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Holiday
Corp.
   ``However, in the current financial markets, financing that
level of payment could be accomplished only at a cost significantly
higher than originally planned,'' Rose said in a statement.
   ``Therefore, management and our board believe it prudent to fix
the special dividend at $30 per share, which positions us to
finance our dividend through bank facilities and strengthens our
equity base for the growth of Promus' businesses.''

   The third-largest savings and loan in
Pennsylvania is merging with Pittsburgh National Bank, which is
owned by the state's largest bank holding company, officials said
Monday.
   The merger with First Federal Savings and Loan Association of
Pittsburgh is subject to government approval. Also needed is
satisfactory completion of a review of First Federal by Pittsburgh
National and approval of the board of directors of Pittsburgh
National's parent company, PNC Financial Corp., the nation's
13th-largest bank holding company.
   The merger will not require a cash payment by Pittsburgh
National or the issuance of additional shares by PNC Financial
since First Federal is a mutual institution.
   Once the transaction is completed, Pittsburgh National said it
will have about $20 billion in assets.
   Some bank branches will be closed, but employees of those
offices will be offered other jobs, said Pittsburgh National
President James E. Rohr.
   First Federal has $3 billion in assets, primarily comprised of
mortgage-related products. It is the 88th largest thrift
nationwide. First Federal has more than 700 full-time and 200
part-time employees and operates 64 branches in western
Pennsylvania.
   Pittsburgh National has more than 4,200 employees. It operates
113 branch offices in Pennsylvania.
   Pittsburgh-based PNC was formed in 1983 by the consolidation of
Pittsburgh National Corp. and Provident National Corp. of
Philadelphia. As of Sept. 30, PNC reported $43.1 billion in assets
and more than 17,000 employees.
   PNC operates 529 community banking offices in Pennsylvania,
Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Delaware and New Jersey.

   U S West and three international

Networks, in the United Kingdom, officials said.
   PCNs are heralded as the next generation of mobile
communications technology. They differ from the cellular phone
systems of today in that they will operate on a different frequency
and use more and smaller cell sites, allowing a much greater volume
of calls to be supported. A cell site is an area served by a
transmission tower that relays calls.
   The project will cost an estimated $1.4 billion to develop and
implement over a 12-year period starting in 1992 or 1993, said Ed
Mattix, a spokesman for U S West International.
   Other companies in the Unitel consortium are STC, a British
electronics, telecommunications and information technology company
and Europe's second-largest maker of telephones; Thorm-EMI of Great
Britain, an international seller and renter of television sets,
records and other telecommunications equipment; and Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom, the telephone company of West Germany.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite industry speculation that CBS is about
to name Tri-Star Pictures President Jeff Sagansky as its new
programming chief, no deal has been made, the network said Monday.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, the deal is not done,'' said
Susan Tick, a CBS spokeswoman in Los Angeles. She declined to
comment on whether CBS has been negotiating with Sagansky,
appointed to his Tri-Star post only last March.
   Sagansky once worked in finance for CBS, whose entertainment
president, Kim LeMasters, resigned last week after two years on the
job. Sagansky had been among those whom network sources said was
being considered for the post.
   But then CBS began talks with two top Hollywood producers, Marcy
Carsey and Tom Werner, about taking over CBS Entertainment, whose
prime-time schedule has been third in the ratings for two
consecutive years.
   The production company of Carsey and Werner makes NBC's ``The
Cosby Show'' and ABC's ``Roseanne,'' both top-rated comedies.
   When CBS' negotiations with them collapsed Friday, Sagansky's
name arose again as a prospect to head CBS Entertainment, network
sources said.
   A senior NBC Entertainment executive until joining Tri-Star in
1985 as its president of production, Sagansky did not return a
phone call Monday to his Burbank office.
   Mark Gill, a Tri-Star spokesman, declined to comment on whether
Saganky plans to join CBS.
   A 1974 Harvard graduate, Sagansky is credited with developing
and overseeing production of such Tri-Star films as ``About Last
Night,'' ``Steel Magnolias,'' and the recently released ``Glory.''
